Roughly speaking, the sound of a guitar note is characterized by an initial 'attack' where the pick or nail produces higher pitched overtones over the top of the fundamental note, followed by a diminution of these overtones. Consequently, the end of the note is softer than the attack. Volume swells alter the tone of the note, reducing the treble tones of the attack and allowing the softer tone that follows to sustain. The technique is often executed using the guitar's volume knob. Beginning with the knob turned down to zero, it is increased when a note is played. The effect can also be performed by using a volume pedal. It is sometimes called \\"violining\\", because the sound is similar to a bowed violin. Allan Holdsworth pioneered the technique of the pedal swelling along with a delay unit to create a thicker sound that is more associated with the cello. George Harrison used a volume pedal on The Beatles' songs \\"I Need You,\\" \\"Yes It Is,\\" and \\"Wait.\\" Roy Buchanan was famous for his emotive volume swells, often in combination with note bending and vibrato. Jan Akkerman used the technique with Focus, as did Phil Keaggy with Glass Harp, and Dickey Betts with The Allman Brothers Band's first few albums. Steve Hackett used guitar swells often with Genesis, such as on the song \\"Hairless Heart\\" from the 1974 album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. Van Halen's 1982 album Diver Down includes the instrumental \\"Cathedral,\\" a guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen played entirely using volume swells. Night Ranger guitarist Brad Gillis uses the effect for the main melody of \\"Rumours in the Air\\" from their 1983 second album Midnight Madness. Tool's 2019 album Fear Inoculum begins with Adam Jones using volume swells to achieve a machinelike sound.

The cartoon's introductory song, \\"Schnappi, das kleine Krokodil,\\" became an Internet hit before it reached #1 on the German Singles chart in January 2005 and other European countries as well, topping the singles charts in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. ==Background== Schnappi was a one-time character in a popular animated German children's TV show called Die Sendung mit der Maus (The Show With the Mouse). In the episode in which Schnappi appears, Schnappi is seen singing a song about life in Egypt using simple language in German. Joy Gruttmann (who sings the song) is the niece of composer Iris Gruttmann, and has since 1999 sung children's songs for ARD's children's broadcast Die Sendung mit der Maus. In February 2001, when she was five years old, she sang her fifth song, Schnappi, das kleine Krokodil, which in 2004 and 2005 ended up at the top of the charts in a number of countries, after first becoming popular through the internet. ==Commercial success== In 2004 Schnappi became popular on the Internet. Radio station RauteMusik began playing Schnappi, which led to a single release of \\"Schnappi, das kleine Krokodil\\" in December 2004. The single reached number one on Germany's GfK Entertainment Chart on January 3, 2005, staying at the top for 10 weeks. The song was then released worldwide and peaked at number one in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland in early 2005. It was translated into a French version titled \\"Crocky le petit crocodile\\", a Lithuanian version called \\"≈†napis ma≈æas klokodilas\\", and a Japanese version entitled \\"Togetogeshi, chiisai wani\\" (Âà∫„ÄÖ„Åó„ÄÅÂ∞è„Åï„ÅÑÈ∞ê). Belgian techno group Dynamite released a cover version that charted at number three in Belgium while the original version was still topping the chart. In April, the song began to experience success in Australasia. It made its first chart appearance on New Zealand's Recorded Music NZ (then RIANZ) chart at number 32 on April 25. The next week, it jumped to number three before reaching number two for the first time on its third week in. Between May 9 and July 18, the single fluctuated around the top 10, eventually spending five non-consecutive weeks at number two, denied the top position by Savage's \\"Moonshine\\", The Black Eyed Peas' \\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\\", and Crazy Frog's version of \\"Axel F\\". It remained in the top 10 until September 12. On July 17, the song debuted at number 20 on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart, reaching a peak of number six on August 21. A studio album, Schnappi und Seine Freunde was released through Polydor Records in February 2005. It peaked at number five in Finland, number two in Germany, and number one in Austria. A second single, \\"Ein Lama in Yokohama\\" (credited as \\"Schnappi und das Lama\\"), was released in April 2005 and became another top ten single in Austria, Germany and Norway. It narrowly missed the top 10 in New Zealand, reaching number 11, and peaked at number 26 in Australia. It became Schnappi's last hit in both countries. In November 2005, \\"Jing! Jingeling! Der Weihnachtsschnappi!\\" was released and peaked at number three in Norway, but did not reach the top 10 anywhere else. This would become Schnappi's last hit in Europe. The second and final studio album, Schnappi's Winterfest, was released in December 2005, only charting in Austria and Germany at numbers 43 and 25, respectively. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Schnappi und Seine Freunde (2005) * Schnappi's Winterfest (2005) ===Singles=== * \\"Schnappi, das kleine Krokodil\\" (2004) * \\"Ein Lama in Yokohama\\" (2005) * \\"Jing!

He is best known for his English translation of the Authorised Daily Prayer Book, informally known as the \\"Singer's Siddur\\". ==Biography== ===Personal life and education=== Singer was born in London in 1846 to a Hungarian father and English mother. At age 8 (1855) his mother took him to visit Raab, then in Hungary. She believed he would get a better education there, but shortly after their arrival she contracted cholera and died within 24 hours. Simeon remained there a few months with family members, and then returned to London. He \\"possessed an exceptional mind\\", and at the age of 13 he was the recipient of the Barnett Myers Scholarship, allowing him to study. He became a student at the Day School of Jews' College, which had only recently been founded in 1855. The curriculum of the school was wide and in addition to Biblical Hebrew, included English, French, German, as well as Mathematics and Science. Singer thus spoke German and French fluently, and some Italian, acquired a working knowledge of Latin and Greek, and was generally well-educated in the arts and sciences. He later moved into the College itself, when he decided to enter the Ministry. His studies there were interrupted by the death of its principal, the Rev Barnett Abrahams. Singer was then fortunate to be taught by the new principal, Dr Michael Friedl√§nder, who \\"took a kindly interest in young Singer\\". In 1867, whilst still a student, he became part-time minister, and combined this with teaching at the Day School, where he was for a time headmaster. He remained at Jews' College for 12 more years. In 1890 he received his Semicha (the Rabbinical Diploma) from Rabbi Isaac Hirsch Weiss of Vienna, author of Dor Dor v'Dor'shav. He underwent a series of written and oral examinations, spending two months there \\"being rigorously examined\\". Singer had begun rabbinical studies with Dayan Jacob Reinowitz of the London Beth Din in 1879, eventually following a \\"demanding three-year course of study\\" with Weiss; he visited the Continent often and spent much time either with Weiss, or studying by himself under Weiss' guidance. On returning to England, Singer did not demand that his title be changed to \\"Rabbi\\", and he continued to be called \\"Reverend\\". Relatedly, \\"he evidenced his self-denial\\" by declining to stand for the post of associate Chief Rabbi following the death of Chief Rabbi Adler. He married Charlotte Pyke in 1867. They had six children: Jules, Samuel, David, Richard, Charles and Freda. His son was the historian Charles Singer; Israel Abrahams was his son-in-law. ===Career=== In 1867, at age 21, he became minister of the Borough Synagogue in Walworth, London (now closed; amalgamated with Brixton Synagogue, 1961). As above, during this time he taught at Jews' College School full-time, and was, for a time, its headmaster. He moved to the New West End Synagogue in 1878, and remained the minister there until his death. As a preacher \\"Singer showed rare gifts\\". His pulpit addresses in general won wide appreciation, and his services were often called for at public functions. He was the first to introduce regular sermons to children. \\"Despite his devotion to public work\\", Singer published some important works; see below He was \\"a power in the community in the direction of moderate progress\\"; he was \\"a lover of tradition, yet at the same time he recognized the necessity of well-considered changes\\". In 1892 at his instigation the first English Conference of Jewish Preachers was held, and some reforms were then and at other times introduced, such as the introduction of Bible Readings in English, the admission of women as choristers and the inclusion of the express consent of the bride as well as the bridegroom at the marriage ceremony. He did much to reunite Conservatives and Liberals in the community, and he himself preached at the Reform Synagogue in Manchester. He had no love for the minute critical analysis of the Bible, but he was attracted to the theory of progressive revelation, and thus was favourably disposed to the modern treatment of the Old Testament. His \\"cheery optimism was at the basis of this attitude\\", and strongly coloured his belief in the Messianic ideals. He \\"held aloof... from all Zionist schemes\\", believing in the restoration of Israel to the Promised Land but nonetheless having doubts about political Zionism. His interest in the fortunes of foreign Jews led him to make several continental journeys on their behalf; he was one of the leading spirits of the Russo-Jewish Committee, of the International Jewish Society for the Protection of Women and of other philanthropic organisations. ==Works== Singer's most famous work was his new edition and English translation of the Authorized Daily Prayer Book (published in 1890), a work which has gone through many large editions and which has probably been the most popular (both with Jews and Christians) of any book published by an English Jew. The Hebrew text was that of Seligman Baer's classic Avodat Yisrael, to which Singer provided an \\"authorised\\" version of the liturgy capable of standardising and stabilising the synagogue service and helping to create an \\"established\\" Judaism in Britain and the Commonwealth (the so-called \\"Minhag Anglia\\".) The Siddur was expanded in 1917 under Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz; 1934 saw a \\"continuous\\" version, minimising the need for cross- reference, and which also incorporated additional material. The 1962 Second Edition, under Chief Rabbi Israel Brodie, was completely re-typeset; also the translation was amended where it had become unclear or archaic, and further additional material had been introduced. The Centenary Edition of 1990 saw an extensively revised translation by Rabbi Eli Cashdan, and also included a series of explanatory notes by Chief Rabbi Lord Jakobovits. In 2006, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks penned a new translation, with commentary, instructions, laws & rubrics; this Fourth Edition formed the basis for the Koren Sacks Siddur published 2009. This Siddur ‚Äì in its various editions ‚Äì has remained the standard prayer book for most orthodox Jews in Great Britain, and for many in the Commonwealth, and is still informally known as the \\"Singer's Siddur.\\" In 1915 the Bloch Publishing Company published an American version, The Standard Prayer Book, which was widely used until the introduction of Philip Birnbaum's Ha-Siddur Ha-Shalem in 1949. In 1896 the Cambridge University Press published Talmudical Fragments in the Bodleian Library of which Singer was joint author with Solomon Schechter. Israel Abrahams had access to all of his manuscripts and, after Singer's death, produced three volumes of his literary remains (1908). In 1914, Abrahams also published an annotated edition of Singer's Siddur, with \\"Historical and Explanatory Notes\\". ==See also== * List of British Jews * Siddur#Popular siddurim * Joseph Diggle: in 1897 Singer strongly opposed Diggle's policy at the London School Board, but refused nomination as a member. * Philip Birnbaum ==External links and references== References * * Rabbi Geoffrey L.

Those attending this particular synagogue might also include the descendants of such freemen.Hunter, S.F., \\"Libertines\\", International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1939 Opinion is divided as to the number of synagogues named here. The probability is that there are three, corresponding to the geographical regions involved, Rome and Italy, North East Africa, and Asia Minor. In this case the Synagogue of the Libertines is the assembly of the Freedmen from Rome, descendants of the Jews enslaved by Pompey after his conquest of Judea in 63 BC.

The Greek towns lying west from Cyrene would naturally be called Libyan. Consequently, these returned Jews, instead of being liberalized by their residence abroad, were more tenacious of Judaism and more bitter against Stephen than those who had never left Judea. ==References== Category:Acts of the Apostles Category:Synagogues in Italy Category:Jewish‚ÄìChristian debate ","title":"Synagogue of the Libertines"},{"id":"1432228","text":"The Devil's Tower, a unique architectural monument surviving from Volga Bulgaria Spasskaya Street Gassara Street Yelabuga (alternative spelling that reflects the Cyrillic spelling: Elabuga, , Search Google for \\"Elabuga\\"; ; ) is a town in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, located on the right bank of the Kama River and east from Kazan.

With 62 congregations (including 7 affiliates and 1 associate) (Feb 2020), comprising 40,000 members, it is the largest synagogue body in Europe. The spiritual leader of the union bears the title of Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth ‚Äì a title that bears some formal recognition by the Crown, even though his rabbinical authority is recognised by only slightly more than half of British Jews. ==History== Nathan Marcus Adler, Chief Rabbi and founder of the United Synagogue The United Synagogue was mandated by an Act of Parliament in 1870, granting formal recognition to a union of three London synagogues forged by Nathan Marcus Adler, who bore the title of Chief Rabbi of the British Empire. Leaders of the organization included Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, who served as president in 1910. At the time of its inception, the United Synagogue was the dominant force in Jewish communal and religious organization, though the organization lost some of its hegemony in the 1880s with mass migrations of Jews from Eastern Europe, who brought with them strains of Hassidic Judaism, Reform Judaism and secularism. In 1887, Jewish community leader Samuel Montagu created the Federation of Synagogues, which worked to unite Orthodox synagogues of Russian and other eastern European migrants living in the slums of East London. Today, the Federation serves 21 synagogues, compared to the United Synagogue's 64. There are also numerous orthodox synagogues in Britain, including Haredi, Chabad, and others, unaffiliated with United Synagogue. In addition, there are congregations of Reform, Masorti and Liberal Jews that are not included in the United Synagogue; so that, today, the organisation represents about 30 percent of all British congregants. Since 1990, central Orthodoxy has declined from 66 percent to 55 percent of total congregants, though this decline has flattened out in recent years. In 1970, the United Synagogue celebrated its centenary. Events included a special service held at the St. Johns Wood Synagogue, an exhibition of Jewish artefacts held at the Christies Auction Rooms, and a celebratory banquet held at the Dorchester Hotel in the presence of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. This was the first time that the Queen had attended an event held by the Anglo Jewish community, although the Duke of Edinburgh had previously attended the tercentenary commemoration of the return of Jews to England during the period of Oliver Cromwell. Plans are afoot to celebrate 150 years of the US in the year 2020. Over time, the United Synagogue have closed synagogues in areas of Jewish decline, including many grand cathedral type synagogues, such as Bayswater (to make way for the Westway road), New Cross, Brixton (one of the very few large United Synagogues south of the river), the Great Synagogue, East London, Hammersmith, Cricklewood, Egerton Road, Lofting Road and Dalston, while opening new synagogues in areas of Jewish growth, especially in the north western suburbs of London, such as Boreham Wood, Edgware, Barnet and other communities. Seven of the present United Synagogue buildings feature the stained glass windows of the twentieth century artist David Hillman;https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/The-Hillman- windows-375074 the largest collection, over 100 windows, is at the St. Johns Wood Synagogue. Some of the closed synagogues (such as Lofting Road or DalstonDalston Synagogue) were knocked down and replaced by other buildings, some underwent conversion, often to other religious denominations (Hammersmith is now a church), while in one instance ‚Äì Egerton Road ‚Äì the synagogue was purchased by one of the local ultra-orthodox groups (the Bobov) and retains a strong Jewish presence.Egerton Road synagogue Much of the previous formality of the United Synagogue, such as the wearing of clerical canonicals by its clergy and waistcoats and top hats by its wardens has now disappeared. The synagogues use modern Hebrew vernacular for its prayers. The Finchley (Kinloss) synagogue, one of the largest of the existing communities, holds an annual religious service to commemorate the Independence Day of the State of Israel, attended by the Chief Rabbi, the Ambassador of Israel and a senior member of Her Majesty's government. The United Synagogue also owns a number of cemeteries throughout London. Some of these in the East End and West Ham have now closed and are no longer in use, the Willesden cemetery ‚Äì including many famous historical Jewish figures such as the Chief Rabbis, Rabbis of communities and other well known historical personalities is now the recipient of a heritage grant, while the cemeteries in Waltham Forest and Bushey continue to function. Bushey has recently consecrated a new section which has reached the short list of the Stirling Prize for architecture in for 2018, the first time a cemetery of any kind has been a candidate for this award. ==Activities== The United Synagogue provides a number of religious services to the Orthodox community, including: * The Tribe youth movement, which offers after-school programmes, programmes for toddlers, and trips to Israel for young people. * Young US ‚Äì programmes for young adults. * A Beit Din (the London Beth Din) ‚Äì a religious court to decide halakhic matters. * Certification of Kashrut under the auspices of the London Beth Din. * Burial services, including the maintenance of several cemeteries. * Educational material provided by We Believe in Israel, the grassroots initiative of BICOM. United Synagogue is an active supporter of Israel. The organisation sponsors trips to Israel for members and youth, distributes information packages about Israel from its website, and offers courses in Israeli history and politics and Hebrew. In October 2014, it urged its members to lobby members of Parliament to oppose a motion to recognise the State of Palestine. Activities are financed mostly from charitable donations and gifts, and from dues paid by member synagogues.

Logosophy is an ethical-philosophical doctrine developed by the Argentine humanist and thinker Carlos Bernardo Gonz√°lez Pecotche, which offers teachings of conceptual order and practices that lead oneself to self-cognition and self-improvement through a process of conscious evolution.\\"Dicion√°rio da L√≠ngua Portuguesa\\". Brazil: Departamento de Imprensa Nacional, 1966, Volume 3 (J-P).\\"Dicion√°rio Contempor√¢neo da L√≠ngua Portuguesa\\". Brazil: Editora Delta S.A., 2nd Brazilian Edition, Volumes III and IV. Logosophy argues that the thoughts can be autonomous and independent of one's individual will, and that they are born and fulfill their function under the influence of the moral or psychic states of their owner or someone else. Its purpose is to free the mental faculties of suggestive influences, allowing the human being to think freely and understand the true objectives of life. Logosophy presents itself as a new and conclusive science, which reveals a method and a set of disciplines of its own, with the purpose of leading man to the knowledge of his own self, of the Universe, and its eternal laws. It also presents itself as a new way of feeling and conceiving life, since it presents a new conception of humanity, human psychic and mental organization, and the human life in its broadest possibilities and proportions.Gonz√°lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. ‚ÄúLogosophy, Science and Method‚Äù. Brazil: Editora Logos√≥fica, 1980, Lesion I. Its name is the combination of the Greek word \\"logos\\" and \\"sophia\\", which the author has adopted as meaning Creative Word or Manifestation of the Supreme Knowledge, and Original Science or Wisdom, respectively, to denote \\"a new line of cognitions, a doctrine, a method and a technique which are eminently its own\\". Logosophy was created in 1930, with the creation of the first Logosophical Foundation in the city of C√≥rdoba, Argentina.Logosophy ‚Äì International Portal ==The author== Carlos Bernardo Gonz√°lez Pecotche, also known as Raumsol, was born on August 11, 1901 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was a son of Jorge N. Gonz√°lez and Maria Pecotche de Gonz√°lez. He married Paulina Eugenia Puntel on October 8, 1924 and had a son, Carlos Federico Gonz√°lez Puntel, born on July 10, 1925. He died in Buenos Aires on April 4, 1963. ==The method== The logosophical method, as its author claims, is unique in its essence and has the quality of adapting itself to each and every mind, giving it the share of knowledge that it is capable of absorbing.Gonz√°lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. ‚ÄúLogosophy, Science and Method‚Äù. Brazil: Editora Logos√≥fica, 1980, Lesion VIII. The examination of the aptitudes and the conditions of assimilation are factors to which the method gives special consideration. Its main artery, which makes the teaching live and breathe in the soul of the student, is the one which requires him, as the main function of the cognition which it bestows, to become intimately familiarized with the teaching to the point of identifying himself with it by associating it to his life. The logosophical method intends to guide the human being to a more thorough knowledge of his mind considered in the entirety of its complex operation. Logosophy invites man to carry out a complete study of his own psychology ‚Äì his character, his tendencies, his thoughts, his qualities, his deficiencies, and whatever relates directly or indirectly to the movements of his mental faculties and contemplates his spiritual state. ==Objectives== The main objectives of the logosophical cognitions are:Gonz√°lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. ‚ÄúInitiation Course Into Logosophy‚Äù. Brazil: Editora Logos√≥fica, 1981, Page 16. *Man‚Äôs conscious evolution, achieved through the organization of his mental, sensitive and instinctive systems. *The knowledge of one‚Äôs self, which implies full mastery of the elements which constitute the secret of each individual‚Äôs existence. *The integration of one‚Äôs spirit, so that the individual may put to use the values that are his own, for they have their origin in his self inheritance. *The knowledge of the universal laws, which is indispensable for the human being to adjust his life to their wise principles. *The knowledge of the mental, transcendent or metaphysical world, where all the ideas and thoughts that fecund human life originate. *The creation of a new life and a better destiny, by surpassing to a maximum one‚Äôs ordinary prerogatives. *The development and mastery of the functions of studying, learning, teaching, thinking and accomplishing, all of which are transubstantiated through the Logosophical method into individual aptitudes of an invaluable significance for the future of the education of mankind. ==Logosophy and Philosophy== According to Gonz√°lez Pecotche, the logosophical knowledge does not have common points of reference with any of the usually studied branches of knowledge, be it Science, Philosophy, Psychology, etc.Gonz√°lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. ‚ÄúInitiation Course Into Logosophy‚Äù. Brazil: Editora Logos√≥fica, 1981, Page 33. Regarding the relationship between Logosophy and Philosophy, Gonz√°lez Pecotche stated: ‚ÄúIn this regard, Logosophy includes two powerful forces which, when they unite and bond, lead man to accomplish the two aims of this existence: to evolve toward perfection and to constitute himself as a real contributor to humanity. One of these factors is the cognition that it offers to the human mind; the other is the affection that teaches how to fulfill human hearts. The common science lacks this affection, this force; it is cold and rigid, and sometimes speculative and intemperate, as in the case of philosophy; conversely, Logosophy is conciliatory. Herein lies the great difference and which also explains why it is capable of realizing great accomplishments in the human soul and which seem inconceivable to those who remain extraneous to such possibilities.‚ÄùGonz√°lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. ‚ÄúAn Introduction to Logosophical Cognition‚Äù. Brazil: Editora Logos√≥fica, 1998, Page 93. ==Logosophy as Humanism== Amongst the multiple views that Gonz√°lez Pecotche provides of Logosophy, he also mentions that it is a new kind of Humanism. However he differentiates his original contributions from the works of other Humanists: ‚ÄúDiffering therefore from the generalized concept of humanism, our humanism starts from one's own sensitive and thinking being who seeks to accomplish within himself the evolutionary process that all humanity must follow. One's accomplishment in this respect will inevitably constitute later a true example of what each participant within the great human family can achieve.‚ÄùGonz√°lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. ‚ÄúThe Mechanism of Conscious Life‚Äù.

A leap of faith according to Kierkegaard involves circularity insofar as the leap is made by faith.Hannay, Alastair, and Gordon Marino. (eds.) The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard. Cambridge, In his book Concluding Unscientific Postscript, he describes the core part of the leap of faith: the leap. ‚ÄúThinking can turn toward itself in order to think about itself and skepticism can emerge. But this thinking about itself never accomplishes anything.‚Äù Kierkegaard says thinking should serve by thinking something. Kierkegaard wants to stop \\"thinking's self-reflection\\" and that is the movement that constitutes a leap.Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 335 He is against people thinking about religion all day without ever doing anything; but he is also against external shows and opinions about religion. Instead, Kierkegaard is in favor of the internal movement of faith.Fear and Trembling/Repetition, 1843, Hong p. 68ff, Practice In Christianity, Hong p. 133ff Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 607ff He says, \\"where Christianity wants to have inwardness, worldly Christendom wants outwardness, and where Christianity wants outwardness, worldly Christendom wants inwardness.\\"Works of Love, Hong p. 146 But, on the other hand, he also says: \\"The less externality, the more inwardness if it is truly there; but it is also the case that the less externality, the greater the possibility that the inwardness will entirely fail to come. The externality is the watchman who awakens the sleeper; the externality is the solicitous mother who calls one; the externality is the roll call that brings the soldier to his feet; the externality is the reveille that helps one to make the great effort; but the absence of the externality can mean that the inwardness itself calls inwardly to a person - alas - but it can also mean that the inwardness will fail to come.\\"Concluding Postscript, p. 382, Hong translation The \\"most dreadful thing of all is a personal existence that cannot coalesce in a conclusion,\\"S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 232 according to Kierkegaard. He asked his contemporaries if any of them had reached a conclusion about anything or did every new premise change their convictions. David F. Swenson described the leap in his 1916 article The Anti-Intellectualism of Kierkegaard using some of Kierkegaard's ideas. This is how the leap was described in 1950 and then in 1960. ==The leap into sin and into faith== Kierkegaard describes \\"the leap\\" using the famous story of Adam and Eve, particularly Adam's qualitative leap into sin. Adam's leap signifies a change from one quality to another, mainly the quality of possessing no sin to the quality of possessing sin. Kierkegaard maintains that the transition from one quality to another can take place only by a \\"leap\\" (Thomte 232). When the transition happens, one moves directly from one state to the other, never possessing both qualities. \\"The moment is related to the transition of the one to the many, of the many to the one, of likeness to unlikeness, and that it is the moment in which there is neither one nor many, neither a being determined nor a being combined.\\"(Thomte Note 82-85). \\"In the Moment man becomes conscious that he is born; for his antecedent state, to which he may not cling, was one of non-being. In the Moment man also becomes conscious of the new birth, for his antecedent state was one of non-being.\\"S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Philosophical Fragments p. 15 Johann Kaspar Lavater (right) trying to convert Moses Mendelssohn to Christianity as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing looks on.Kierkegaard felt that a leap of faith was vital in accepting Christianity due to the paradoxes that exist in Christianity. In his books, Philosophical Fragments and Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard delves deeply into the paradoxes that Christianity presents. Moses Mendelssohn did the same thing when Johann Kaspar Lavater demanded he discuss why he didn't want to become a Christian. Both Kierkegaard and Mendelssohn knew the difficulties involved when discussing religious topics: > \\"As I so sedulously sought to avoid an explanation in my own apartment > amidst a small number of worthy men, of whose good intentions I had every > reason to be persuaded, it might have been reasonably inferred that a public > one would be extremely repugnant to my disposition; and that I must have > inevitably become the more embarrassed when the voice demanding it happened > to be entitled to an answer at any rate.\\" Moses Mendelssohn, Letter to J. C. > Lavater,Letter to Lavater December 12, 1769 Kierkegaard's use of the term \\"leap\\" was in response to \\"Lessing's Ditch\\" which was discussed by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729‚Äì1781) in his theological writings.Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, \\"On the proof of the spirit and of power\\" (1777), in Philosophical and Theological Writings, translated and edited by H. B. Nisbet, Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 83-88. See Concluding Postscript, Hong p. 61ff and 93ff; see also Benton 2006 Kierkegaard was indebted to Lessing's writings in many ways. Lessing tried to battle rational Christianity directly and, when that failed, he battled it indirectly through, what Kierkegaard called, \\"imaginary constructions\\".Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol I, Hong p. 114, 263-266, 381, 512, 617 See Lessing's Nathan the Wise Nathan the Wise Archive.org Both may be indebted to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau used the idea in his 1762 book Emile like this: Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) used the term in his 1784 essay, Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment? Kant wrote: Lessing said, \\"accidental truths of history can never become the proof of necessary truths of reason.\\" Kierkegaard points out that he also said, \\"contingent truths of history can never become the demonstrations of necessary truths of reason.\\"Lessing's Theological Writings, On the Proof of the Spirit and of Power, Chadwick, p. 53, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol 1 p. 97 Kierkegaard liked Lessing because he \\"had a most uncommon gift of explaining what he himself had understood. With that he stopped; in our day people go further and explain more than they themselves have understood.\\"Fear and Trembling, note p. 88 Kierkegaard has Don Juan in Either/Or escort young girls \\"all in the dangerous age of being neither grown- up nor children\\" to \\"the other side of the ditch of life\\" as he, himself, \\"dances over the abyss\\" only to \\"instantly sink down into the depths.\\"Either/Or Part I, Swenson p. 107, 128-129, 133-134 He has Don Juan \\"preach the gospel of pleasure\\" to Elvira and seduces her from the convent and wonders if there is a priest who can \\"preach the gospel of repentance and remorse\\" with the same power as Don Juan preached his gospel.Either/Or Part I, Swenson p. 191-197 Both Lessing and Kierkegaard are discussing the agency one might use to base one's faith upon. Does history provide all the proofs necessary to cross that \\"ugly, broad ditch\\"?Lessing, Theological Writings p. 55 Or is there \\"no direct and immediate transition to Christianity\\".Concluding Unscientific Postscript Vol I, p. 49 Does one become a Christian \\"in the fulness of time\\" as Kierkegaard puts itS√∏ren Kierkegaard, Philosophical Fragments p. 12-13 or is \\"there only one proof of spirit and that is the spirit‚Äôs proof within oneself. Whoever demands something else may get proofs in superabundance, but he is already characterized at spiritless.\\"The Concept of Anxiety, Nichol, p. 95 He also writes about this in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript: 250pxThe implication of taking a leap of faith can, depending on the context, carry positive or negative connotations, as some feel it is a virtue to be able to believe in something without evidence while others feel it is foolishness. It is a hotly contested theological and philosophical concept. For instance, the association between \\"blind faith\\" and religion is disputed by those with deistic principles who argue that reason and logic, rather than revelation or tradition, should be the basis of the belief \\"that God has existed in human form, was born and grew up\\". Jesus is the \\"paradox\\", the \\"absolute paradox\\".Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol I, Hong see pages 208-225 When Christianity becomes a scholarly enterprise one tends to \\"reflect oneself into Christianity\\" but Kierkegaard says, one should \\"reflect oneself out of something else and become, more and more simply, a Christian.\\"S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Point of View, Lowrie p. 144 250px Kierkegaard was concerned that individuals would spend all their lives trying to define Christianity, love, God, the Trinity, sin, et cetera, and never get to the business of \\"actually\\" making a decision in time to become a Christian who could then act on the basis of that decision. He discussed the inner and the outer relationship existing in belief. \\"Compared with the Hegelian notion that the outer is the inner and the inner the outer, it certainly is extremely original. But it would be even more original if the Hegelian axiom were not only admired by the present age but also had retroactive power to abolish, backward historically, the distinction between the visible and invisible Church. The invisible Church is not a historical phenomenon; as such it cannot be observed objectively at all, because it is only in subjectivity.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol I p. 54 There has to be a balance between objective and subjective knowledge. Hegel went to the extreme objective side so Kierkegaard decided to go to the extreme subjective side. Even some theistic realms of thought do not agree with the implications that this phrase carries. For instance, C. S. Lewis argues against the idea that Christianity requires a \\"leap of faith,\\" (as the term is most commonly understood). One of Lewis' arguments is that supernaturalism, a basic tenet of Christianity, can be logically inferred based on a teleological argument regarding the source of human reason. Nonetheless, some Christians are less critical of the term and do accept that religion requires a \\"leap of faith\\". What is often missed is that Kierkegaard himself was an orthodox, Scandinavian Lutheran in conflict with the liberal theological establishment of his day. His works built on one another and culminated with the orthodox Lutheran conception of a God that unconditionally accepts man, faith itself being a gift from God, and that the highest moral position is reached when a person realizes this and, no longer depending upon her or himself, takes the leap of faith into the arms of a loving God. In a Lutheran context, the leap of faith becomes much clearer. Jacobi, Hegel, and C.S. Lewis wrote about Christianity in accordance with their understanding but Kierkegaard didn't want to do that. He felt that it was too dangerous to put in writing what was most holy to himself. He said, \\"Not even what I am writing here is my innermost meaning. I cannot entrust myself to paper in that way, even though I see it in what is written. Think what could happen! The paper could disappear; there could be a fire where I live and I could live in uncertainty about whether it was burned or still existed; I could die and thus leave it behind me; I could lose my mind and my innermost being could be in alien hands; I could go blind and not be able to find it myself, not know whether I stood with it in my hands without asking someone else, not know whether he lied, whether he was reading what was written there or something else in order to sound me out.\\" Kierkegaard was of the opinion that faith is something different from other things: unexplainable and inexplicable. The more a person tries to explain personal faith to another, the more entangled that person becomes in language and semantics but \\"recollection\\" is \\"das Zugleich, the all-at-once,\\" that always brings him back to himself.(Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 386) ==The appropriation of faith== Kierkegaard stuck to his concept of Christianity as an inner struggle where the single individual stands before God rather than before others. Because standing before God is where the decisive struggle occurs for each single individual. Each single individual who has an \\"interest\\" in becoming a Christian has a God-relationship which is different from any other individual. The more we look to \\"others\\" for our God-relationship, the more we have a simulated, mediated relationship with an idea. The idea, or ideal, isn't the highest. But getting the idea off the paper or the drawing board and putting it to use in life is the absolute for the Christian. In Works of Love (1847) he wrote, \\"Love for the neighbor does not want to be sung about, it wants to be accomplished.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript p.21, 105-106, 193-200, Works of Love, Chapter II B You Shall Love the Neighbor. P. 44ff Christ didn't say one should think about loving the neighbor, he said, \\"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\\" (Matthew 22.39) He put it this way in Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions (1845) in Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1846) in Sickness Unto Death (1849) and again in Works of Love (1847). == Kierkegaard, Goethe, Marx, and Tolstoy == Kierkegaard questioned how a person changes. Some, like Hegel and Goethe, believed that an external event was required for a new epoch to begin. Kierkegaard disagreed because something might never happen in an external way that would cause a person to change and a possibility for a better life might be lost. Marx followed after Hegel and Goethe but Tolstoy agreed more with Kierkegaard in his \\"view of life\\".Either/Or, Swenson, Preface Goethe may have been mocking the idea that the birth of Christ was what made him important or he may have seriously thought that his, Goethe's, own birth made him important. Kierkegaard didn't believe that Christ had this \\"upside-downness that wanted to reap before it sowed or this kind of cowardliness that wanted to have certainty before it began.\\" Goethe began his autobiography with the certainty that his life was going to have a great effect on the world stage. Within the first twenty pages of his autobiography Goethe had pointed to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake as another great life changing event in his life.. Goethe's book was translated Truth and Poetry but was also translated Truth and Fiction. Both authors seemed to be against having a fictional existence. Goethe believed the existence of Christ was being fictionalized while Kierkegaard believed the existence Goethe wrote about in his own autobiography was fictional ‚Äì and much of it was. Count Leo Tolstoy said he found out \\"there was no God\\" in 1838 when he was 12 years old.Tolstoy, My Confession, p. 1. He had to work through this idea for the next 38 years until he could come away with a method by which he could believe, not only in God but in Christ.Tolstoy, Wikisource, What I Believe. What I Believe. Librivox.org Kierkegaard heard the same from Hegelian philosophers and worked through his doubt to belief but he opposed that method. His thought was to start with faith and proceed forward making positive steps rather than always falling back to start over after doubt had prevailed. He said, \\"False doubt doubts everything except itself; with the help of faith, the doubt that saves doubts only itself.\\"S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Philosophical Fragments, 1844, Swenson p. 137 Kierkegaard didn't want to argue about his faith any more than he wanted to argue about why he may or may not get married or become a professor. He just wanted to make the movement from \\"possibility to actuality\\"S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol 1, p. 314-315 Hong translation and knew that he would just be wasting time if he tried to explain himself. > I think that, just as a Christian always ought to be able to explain his > faith, so also a married man ought to be able to explain his marriage, not > simply to anyone who deigns to ask, but to anyone he thinks worthy of it, or > even if, as in this case, unworthy, he finds it propitious to do so. > Either/Or Part II, p. 88-89, Hong Tolstoy tried to explain the method he used to come to grips with the Christian religion. He acted on his beliefs by freeing his serfs, writing books to help them learn to read and giving them land to farm and live on. He didn't argue and reason with his neighbors; he just did what he set out to do. S√∏ren KierkegaardKarl Marx complained about Hegelian philosophers in Theses on Feuerbach in this way, \\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways: the point, however, is to change it.\\" Walter Kaufmann changed the quote to reflect the Kierkegaardian difference in his 1959 book, From Shakespeare to Existentialism: > His [Kierkegaard's] relation to philosophy is best expressed by changing one > small word in Marx's famous dictum: \\"The philosophers have only interpreted > the world, in various ways: the point, however, is to change\\"-not \\"it,\\" as > Marx said, but ourselves.\\" p. 202. Tolstoy said the same thing: \\"There can > be only one permanent revolution ‚Äî a moral one; the regeneration of the > inner man. How is this revolution to take place? Nobody knows how it will > take place in humanity, but every man feels it clearly in himself. And yet > in our world everybody thinks of changing humanity, and nobody thinks of > changing himself.\\"Pamphlets. Translated from the Russian p. 29 Only in changing oneself is one equal with another, according to Kierkegaard because, in Christianity, all are equal before God. The world is too abstract to change; but the single individual, you yourself: that is something concrete.See S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses (1843-1844), p. 86 Kierkegaard put it this way in his Upbuilding Discourses of 1843-1844 and in his Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits of 1847: The idea behind world history and constant quantification dehumanizes the quality known as the single individual and can produce \\"soul rot due to the monotony of self- concern and self-preoccupation\\" with anxiety about where you fit within the system. Language comes to the aid with copious quantities of words to explain everything. But Kierkegaard says: \\"the pathos of the ethical is to act.\\" ==You are the one== The difference between Kierkegaard and Marx is that one applied everything to himself while the other applied everything to someone else or to the whole world. Appropriating information or a life-view is difficult and it's more difficult the less one relies on the opinions of others. Abraham just heard God's promises and they were unreasonable but he had faith. This idea that the world has to be reasonable or respond to human reason is one that omits the world of the spirit. The world is abstract, the church is abstract, the world of the spirit is abstract but the single individual is concrete if one wills to be that. And the single individual relates himself or herself to the world, the church, the world of the spirit, the environment, the established order, the educational facilities in a unique way according to Kierkegaard. The leap means to stop relating yourself to a crowd or a race and then to the world, the church, the world of the spirit, the environment, etc. Once the individual chooses to do that, the leap is made, resolutions become possibilities and one's personality can be developed in freedom. David and NathanKierkegaard started out, in Either/Or Part 1, by saying, \\"‚ÄúYou know how the prophet Nathan dealt with King David when he presumed to understand the parable the prophet had told him but was unwilling to understand that it applied to him. Then to make sure, Nathan added: You are the man, O King. In the same way I also have continually tried to remind you that you are the one who is being discussed and you are the one who is spoken to.‚ÄùEither/Or Part I, p. 5 Swenson 2 Samuel 12.7 He discussed this again in another way in Either/Or Part II where he begins: \\"The esthetic view also considers the personality in relation to the surrounding world, and the expression for this is in its recurrence in the personality of enjoyment. But the esthetic expression for enjoyment in its relation to the personality is mood. That is, the personality is present in the mood, but it is dimly present. ... The mood of the person who lives ethically is centralized. He is not in the mood, and he is not mood, but he has mood and has the mood within himself. What he works for is continuity, and this is always the master of mood. His life does not lack mood-indeed, it has a total mood. But this is acquired; it is what would be called aequale tempermentum [even disposition]. But this is no esthetic mood, and no person has it by nature or immediately.\\"S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Either/Or 1843 II p. 229-230 Hong Later, in 1845, he repeated the same point in Stages on Life's Way with a story about an individual with an addiction to gambling and another individual who was a gambler but wasn't in despair because of it: Throughout his writings Kierkegaard reiterated his emphasis on the single individual learning how to make a resolution. One example is the following prayer from his April 26, 1848 book Christian Discourses. ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * . * . * . ==External links== * Gotthold Lessing, Lessing's Theological Writings, Selections in Translation Stanford University Press, Jun 1, 1957 * * Center on Capitalism & Society 200 Anniversary of Soren Kierkegaard Leap of Faith (Video) * Jack Crabtree (Gutenberg College, Eugene Oregon) Explaining Kierkegaard * Kierkegaard's Leap of Faith YouTube Video * From the Aesthetic to the Leap of Faith: S√∏ren Kierkegaard YouTube video Category:Belief Category:Concepts in logic Category:Concepts in epistemology Category:S√∏ren Kierkegaard Category:Christian personal development ","title":"Leap of faith"},{"id":"1432417","text":"Janice Rhea Reimer (born May 23, 1952) is a Canadian politician and the first female mayor of Edmonton, Alberta, having served in that capacity from 1989 until 1995. Highlights of her time in office included the inception of a new waste management system (which included curbside pickup of recyclables) and repeated efforts by Peter Pocklington, owner of the Edmonton Oilers, to secure concessions from the city in exchange for his agreement not to move the team. Although she has never sought office at the provincial or federal levels, she is a lifelong New Democrat. ==Early life== Reimer was born in Edmonton in 1952, the daughter of Neil Reimer, who would go on to lead the Alberta New Democratic Party. In 1973, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Alberta. After graduation, she spent three years travelling in Southeast Asia, Australia, and India (serving as a welfare officer in Darwin and Brisbane, Australia from 1975 until 1977). In 1977, she returned to Edmonton, and became the citizens' coordinator of the Calder Action Committee, a neighbourhood advocacy association. ==Politics== ===Alderman=== Reimer first sought office in the 1980 municipal election, in which she finished second of eight candidates for alderman in the city's Ward 1, behind incumbent Ron Hayter. As two candidates were elected per ward, this showing was good enough for her to be elected to the Edmonton City Council. She was re-elected in 1983 and 1986, finishing first in fields of six and four, respectively (Hayter finished second each time). As an alderman, Reimer was an outspoken critic of many elements of the status quo. She argued that too many concessions were made to land development companies by the city, and also questioned why developers often failed to fulfill the conditions on which council made these concessions contingent.Masson (pp. 334-335) She was critical of council's habit of making important decisions in camera.Masson (p. 13) When the city's solicitor resigned due to a sexual harassment scandal, and council negotiated a $160,000 settlement with him, Reimer expressed frustration that the city's law department was not under the jurisdiction of the city manager, where she felt that the settlement would have been better-handled.Masson (p. 517) She also argued that Edmonton's 1979 annexation of surrounding semi-rural land had been a mistake, asserting that it \\"[hadn't] benefited Edmonton at all; we'll be paying years down the road for road maintenance and snow clearing in the new areas\\".Masson (p. 171) As an alderman, Reimer supported changing aldermen's titles to \\"councillor\\", stating that while the title didn't offend her, it should be changed out of respect for others' sensibilities.Masson (p. 196) Early in her third term, she and Hayter jointly called for reform of Edmonton's ward system ‚Äì specifically, Reimer supported increasing the number of wards from six to twelve and halving the number of aldermen per ward to one.Masson (p. 297) The proposal was defeated, in part because mayor Laurence Decore, just re-elected in a landslide, suggested that reform wasn't needed. Reimer also supported increases in aldermanic salaries, suggesting that they had to work harder than members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, since aldermen need to learn issues themselves and can't fall back on a party platform.Masson (p. 211) ===1989 election=== In 1988, mayor Laurence Decore resigned to lead the Alberta Liberal Party, and Terry Cavanagh was selected by council to complete his term. Reimer challenged Cavanagh's bid to keep the job in the 1989 election. The campaign was acrimonious: Cavanagh called Reimer's endorsement by the Canadian Union of Public Employees a \\"blatant attempt to muscle votes for an opponent,\\" and suggested that Reimer harboured a \\"socialist hidden agenda\\" and that the city would become known as \\"Redmonton\\" if she was elected.Masson (p. 254)Masson (p. 320) Reimer won a landslide victory. The cost of Reimer's campaign, just over $139,000, was one of the lowest of any successful mayoral candidate in recent times.Masson (p. 318) Despite the lack of municipal campaign finance rules at the time, Reimer voluntarily refused to accept donations of more than $3,750, and disclosed all donations above $375.Masson (p. 310)Masson (p. 319) She chose $375, the requirement in provincial elections, rather than $100, the requirement in federal elections, in the hopes that it would be more likely to entice her opponents to follow suit; however, none did.Masson (p. 529) ===Mayor=== Reimer entered office with an ambitious agenda, but she was unable to implement much of it due to a fractured city council.Lightbody (p. 158) Notoriously, alderman Sheila McKay dumped a pitcher of water over the head of alderman Brian Mason during one heated dispute; McKay later blamed her actions in part on Reimer's failure to censure Mason for telling her to \\"shut up\\". Faced with a divided and at times hostile city council, Reimer attempted to advance much of her agenda in the council's Executive Committee, but was criticized for this by alderman and former ally Patricia MacKenzie, who alleged that Reimer was attempting to disempower council.Masson (p. 83) Council further impeded her ability to implement her agenda by changing the rules such that the chairs standing committees were elected by standing committees rather than appointed by the mayor; Reimer considered using the mayor's ex-officio status as a member of every standing committee to show up and vote for her preferred candidate, but ultimately decided that \\"it was best they try to sort it out among themselves.\\"Masson (p. 510) Reimer tried to improve relations with both the provincial government, whose relations with Edmonton were strained after fifteen of the city's seventeen seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta had gone to opposition members in the 1989 provincial election. She resumed the deprecated tradition of having the council meet periodically with the city's government caucus (though the caucus consisted only of Nancy Betkowski and Doug Main).Masson (p. 51) She also tried to build bridges with rival Calgary, meeting early with its mayor Al Duerr and proclaiming after the meeting that competition between the cities, while inevitable, \\"should be healthy and based on cities' strengths instead of...running down the other city.\\"Masson (p. 56) As the city's first social democratic mayor since Ivor Dent left office in 1974, Reimer pursued a number of left wing initiatives, some of which earned her criticism. In a controversial move, she refused to wear the city's ceremonial chain of office, which was made from a beaver pelt.Masson (p. 395) She instructed the city administration to develop a strategy to recruit more employees from traditionally disadvantaged groups, but stopped short of calling for hiring quotas; little change resulted.Masson (p. 244) She criticized oil and gas development on lands claimed by the Lubicon Cree, for which she was criticized by an alderman (who had himself endorsed the oil and gas development) who urged her \\"to refrain from expressing views on matters that do not fall within [the city's] mandate.\\"Masson (p. 399) Major issues faced by Reimer during her term as mayor included waste management and the need to open a new landfill. The city administration had proposed a site calculated to minimize NIMBY-ism, but which was expensive and which would run the risk of polluting the North Saskatchewan River.Masson (pp. 371-373) Critics of the site included several communities in Saskatchewan downstream of Edmonton which drew their drinking water from the North Saskatchewan, provincial Environment Minister Ralph Klein, and several environmental experts. After the site was rejected by Edmonton's Board of Health, Reimer attempted to coordinate a regional solution with surrounding communities, but was rebuffed. After further proposals located within Edmonton were met with stringent opposition by community groups and by aldermen from the affected wards, the need for a new landfill was postponed by raising the level of the existing one by one meter. The city manager credited the recently implemented curbside recycling program for reducing the need for a new landfill. She was re-elected by a narrower margin in 1992 (defeating businessmen and former Edmonton Eskimos football player Bill Smith), but went down to a narrow defeat at Smith's hand in 1995, with the winner capitalizing on a perception that Reimer's administration was hostile to business interests. ==Post-political life== After leaving office, Reimer worked as a consultant for the Alberta Council on Aging, and later became the Executive Director of the Alberta Council of Women's Shelters. She largely stayed out of municipal politics, but did criticize a suggestion from alderman Robert Noce that the city borrow from the fund created by the sale of the formerly municipally-owned Edmonton Telephones to cover operating shortfalls; Reimer took the position that city council should be less deferential towards engineers on spending decisions, and that it should consider cutting costs by reducing urban sprawl. In 2004 she was honoured as an Edmontonian of the Century, while in 2006 she was recognized by Governor-General Micha√´lle Jean with the Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case for her contributions to women's equality. She is married to Dr. Hubert Kammerer, a physician at the Boyle McCauley Health Centre, and has two children. She gave birth to both of her children while in office, and remains the only alderman in Edmonton history to do so with two children. ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Edmonton Category:University of Alberta alumni Category:Women mayors of places in Alberta Category:Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case winners ","title":"Jan Reimer"},{"id":"1432422","text":"A commemorative stupa filled with the skulls of the victims at the Killing Field of Choeung Ek. Choeung Ek Killing Field: The bones of victims killed by Khmer Rouge soldiers. Mass grave at the Killing Field of Choeung Ek. The Killing Fields (, ) are a number of sites in Cambodia where collectively more than a million people were killed and buried by the Khmer Rouge regime (the Communist Party of Kampuchea) during its rule of the country from 1975 to 1979, immediately after the end of the Cambodian Civil War (1970‚Äì1975). The mass killings are widely regarded as part of a broad state-sponsored genocide (the Cambodian genocide). Analysis of 20,000 mass grave sites by the DC-Cam Mapping Program and Yale University indicates at least 1,386,734 victims of execution.Documentation Center of CambodiaYale Cambodian Genocide Program Estimates of the total deaths resulting from Khmer Rouge policies, including death from disease and starvation, range from 1.7 to 2.5 million out of a 1975 population of roughly 8 million. In 1979, Vietnam invaded Democratic Kampuchea and toppled the Khmer Rouge regime, an act that is viewed as having ended the genocide. The Cambodian journalist Dith Pran coined the term \\"killing fields\\" after his escape from the regime. The Khmer Rouge regime arrested and eventually executed almost everyone suspected of connections with the former government or with foreign governments, as well as professionals and intellectuals. Ethnic Vietnamese, ethnic Thai, ethnic Chinese, ethnic Cham, Cambodian Christians, and the Buddhist monks were the demographic targets of persecution. As a result, Pol Pot has been described as \\"a genocidal tyrant\\". Martin Shaw described the Cambodian genocide as \\"the purest genocide of the Cold War era\\".Theory of the Global State: Globality as Unfinished Revolution by Martin Shaw, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 141, Ben Kiernan estimates that about 1.7 million people were killed.\\"The CGP, 1994‚Äì2008\\". Cambodian Genocide Program, Yale University Researcher Craig Etcheson of the Documentation Center of Cambodia suggests that the death toll was between 2 and 2.5 million, with a \\"most likely\\" figure of 2.2 million. After 5 years of researching some 20,000 grave sites, he concludes that \\"these mass graves contain the remains of 1,386,734 victims of execution\\". A UN investigation reported 2‚Äì3 million dead, while UNICEF estimated 3 million had been killed.William Shawcross, The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust, and Modern Conscience (Touchstone, 1985), pp. 115‚Äì116 Demographic analysis by Patrick Heuveline suggests that between 1.17 and 3.42 million Cambodians were killed,Heuveline, Patrick (2001). \\"The Demographic Analysis of Mortality in Cambodia\\". In Forced Migration and Mortality, eds. Holly E. Reed and Charles B. Keely. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. while Marek Sliwinski suggests that 1.8 million is a conservative figure. Even the Khmer Rouge acknowledged that 2 million had been killed‚Äîthough they attributed those deaths to a subsequent Vietnamese invasion.Khieu Samphan, Interview, Time, March 10, 1980 By late 1979, UN and Red Cross officials were warning that another 2.25 million Cambodians faced death by starvation due to \\"the near destruction of Cambodian society under the regime of ousted Prime Minister Pol Pot\\",The New York Times, August 8, 1979. who were saved by international aid after the Vietnamese invasion. ==Process== Rooms of the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum contain thousands of photos taken by the Khmer Rouge of their victims. The judicial process of the Khmer Rouge regime, for minor or political crimes, began with a warning from the Angkar, the government of Cambodia under the regime. People receiving more than two warnings were sent for \\"re-education\\", which meant near-certain death. People were often encouraged to confess to Angkar their \\"pre-revolutionary lifestyles and crimes\\" (which usually included some kind of free-market activity; having had contact with a foreign source, such as a U.S. missionary, international relief or government agency; or contact with any foreigner or with the outside world at all), being told that Angkar would forgive them and \\"wipe the slate clean.\\" They were then taken away to a place such as Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek for torture and/or execution. The executed were buried in mass graves. In order to save ammunition, the executions were often carried out using poison, spades or sharpened bamboo sticks. Inside the Buddhist Memorial Stupa at Choeung Ek, there is evidence of bayonets, knives, wooden clubs, hoes for farming and curved scythes being used to kill victims, with images of skulls, damaged by these implements, as evidence. In some cases the children and infants of adult victims were killed by having their heads bashed against the trunks of Chankiri trees, and then were thrown into the pits alongside their parents. The rationale was \\"to stop them growing up and taking revenge for their parents' deaths.\\" Some victims were required to dig their own graves; their weakness often meant that they were unable to dig very deep. The soldiers who carried out the executions were mostly young men or women from peasant families. ==Prosecution for crimes against humanity== In 1997 the Cambodian government asked for the UN's assistance in setting up a genocide tribunal. It took nine years to agree to the shape and structure of the court‚Äîa hybrid of Cambodian and international laws‚Äîbefore the judges were sworn in, in 2006.Doyle, Kevin. \\"Putting the Khmer Rouge on Trial\\", Time, July 26, 2007MacKinnon, Ian Crisis talks to save Khmer Rouge trial, The Guardian, March 7, 2007The Khmer Rouge Trial Task Force , Royal Cambodian Government The investigating judges were presented with the names of five possible suspects by the prosecution on July 18, 2007. On September 19, 2007 Nuon Chea, second in command of the Khmer Rouge and its most senior surviving member, was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. He faced Cambodian and foreign judges at the special genocide tribunal and was convicted on 7 August 2014 and received a life sentence. On July 26, 2010 Kang Kek Iew (aka Comrade Duch), director of the S-21 prison camp, was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment. His sentence was reduced to 19 years, as he had already spent 11 years in prison.Sentence reduced for former Khmer Rouge prison chief. The Los Angeles Times, July 27, 2010 On February 2, 2012, his sentence was extended to life imprisonment by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. He died on September 2, 2020 Khmer Rouge executioner 'Comrade Duch' who oversaw notorious torture prison dies age 77. CNN, September 2, 2020. ==Legacy== The best known monument of the Killing Fields is at the village of Choeung Ek. Today, it is the site of a Buddhist memorial to the victims, and Tuol Sleng has a museum commemorating the genocide. The memorial park at Choeung Ek has been built around the mass graves of many thousands of victims, most of whom were executed after interrogation at the S-21 Prison in Phnom Penh. The majority of those buried at Choeung Ek were Khmer Rouge killed during the purges within the regime. Many dozens of mass graves are visible above ground, many which have not been excavated yet. Commonly, bones and clothing surface after heavy rainfalls due to the large number of bodies still buried in shallow mass graves. It is not uncommon to run across the bones or teeth of the victims scattered on the surface as one tours the memorial park. If these are found, visitors are asked to notify a memorial park officer or guide.

Their main activities include high-atmospheric lighter-than-air flights carrying cameras or miniature experiments called pongsats and minicubes. They are also engaged in an Airship to Orbit project. JP Aerospace was founded by John Marchel Powell, familiarly known as \\"JP\\", with Michael Stucky and Scott Mayo. JP Aerospace specializes in lighter-than-air flight, with the stated aim of achieving cheap access to space.Powell, John M. (2005). Floating to Space: The Airship to Orbit Program, Apogee Books Space Series. An early suborbital space launch attempt using a rockoon (balloon-launched high power rocket) at the Black Rock Desert in northwestern Nevada in May 1999 was unsuccessful. The event was covered by CNN. The CATS Prize expired without being awarded in November 2000. In the early 21st century they developed a V-shaped high- altitude airship under a U.S. Air Force initiative to provide the rapid launch of battlefield communication and monitoring systems.Alan Boyle (2004), Airship groomed for flight to edge of space, MSNBCJeff Foust (2004), Floating to Space, The Space Review == Balloon flights == Since then, JP Aerospace has launched several balloons into the upper atmosphere, carrying mixed payloads for research students and media companies.

The proposed system employs three separate airship stages to reach orbit. Multiple vehicles are needed because an airship made strong enough to survive the dense and turbulent lower atmosphere would be too small and heavy to lift payloads high enough. An orbital airship must be much larger and with thinner walls to maintain its buoyancy-to-weight ratio.

A long, V-shaped planform with an airfoil profile would provide aerodynamic lift to supplement the airship's inherent buoyancy, with the craft driven by propellers designed to operate in a near vacuum. The Ascender would be larger than any airship yet built, but would be dwarfed by the later stages. It would be operated by a crew of three. JP aerospace has developed two large-scale test models, the Ascender 90 and the Ascender 175. The number denotes the length of the airship in feet (ca. 27.4 m and 53.3 m). More recent airships have reverted to being named in sequence. === Dark Sky Station === The Dark Sky Station would be a permanent floating structure, remaining at 140,000 feet (ca. 42,672 m). It provides an intermediate stage allowing transfer of cargo or personnel between the Ascender stage and the orbital stage. It would also serve as the construction facility for the orbital component, which would be too fragile to travel lower. === Orbital Ascender === The Orbital Ascender airship would be the final flight stage from the station to orbit.David Kushner, Space Invaders, IEEE Spectrum It would initially rise as a lighter- than-air craft from the station at 140,000 feet to 180,000 feet (ca. 42,672 m to 54,864 m). The orbiter would have to be over a mile long to gain enough buoyancy. At 180,000 ft it would accelerate forwards using lightweight, low power ion propulsion, enabling it to rise further with additional aerodynamic lift. This would be powered by solar panels which cover most of the upper surface of the airship. They say that the V-shaped planform and airfoil profile would allow hypersonic flight by 200,000 feet, increasing to orbital speed (above Mach 20). They say that there is a wide margin of drag-to-power ratios within which an orbital airship can attain orbit.Boyle, A. ‚ÄúAirship groomed for flight to edge of space‚Äù nbcnews.com May 21, 2004 They also say that if hit by a meteorite or space debris, this would have little effect because the inner cells are \\"zero pressure balloons\\" saying \\"There is no difference in pressure to create a bursting force. All a meteorite would do is to make a hole.The gas would leak out staggeringly slowly...\\" (Page 112). They also say (page 109) that \\"\\"By losing velocity before it reaches the lower thicker atmosphere, the reentry temperatures are radically lower.... This makes reentry as safe as the climb to orbit\\". The skin would be made of nylon rip-stop polyethylene (page 111). On re-entry the orbital airship slows down at a very high altitude because it has such low mass with such a large cross section presented to the atmosphere (a low ballistic coefficient). If the plan is successful, one estimate of the cost for payload to orbit is $310 per ton.Ezekiel Nygren, Hypothetical Spacecraft and Interstellar Travel.

The path provides a continuous cycle path (with some road crossings) from the north west suburbs toward Melbourne's CBD. Combined with the Taylors Creek Trail and the Footscray Road off-road path, this trail makes for an easy ride linking together the City of Brimbank, Docklands and the Melbourne City Centre. ==Following the Path== Starting at the north end of Brimbank Park, the gravel trail winds its way through the trees along the valley on the east side of the Maribyrnong River and the western end of the park. It passes under the towering EJ Whitten Bridge. Near the bridge base a steep path loops up to the same level as the bridge platform, where it connects to the Western Ring Road Trail. The path then proceeds through riverside parkland alongside suburbs such as North Sunshine and Maidstone before reaching Canning Reserve in Avondale Heights. At Canning Reserve Tea Gardens at Avondale Heights the trail becomes concrete and remains concrete for the next 6 km to Footscray. The path splits into a concrete path that follows a minor creek valley up into Avondale Heights to Monte Carlo Drive Reserve. The main trail, a gravel path, continues along the river. This section of the trail adjoins grassy areas, and sightings of snakes such as the eastern brown snake, on this riverside section of the trail are not uncommon in warmer months Near the confluence of Maribyrnong River and Steele Creek at Essendon West the path becomes concrete and follows Steele creek inland before winding up the hillside to the top of the plateau at Lily St for outstanding views of the Maribyrnong River and the skyscrapers of the Melbourne CBD in the distance. Care needs to be taken crossing Buckley Street if turning off to Steele Creek Trail that connects at this point. The path enters a switch back section that winds back down to the river. Further is Afton Street footbridge (a cream coloured bridge). The trail now runs down both banks of the river. Pipemakers Park footbridge (a red coloured bridge at Newsom Street) was recently restored after being closed off. Construction had started in 2009. At Maribyrnong the path passes through Pipemakers Park with Melbourne's Living Museum of the West, which contains historical presentations on the river valley and the people who have lived there since its initial occupation up to 40,000 years ago by the Wurundjeri people. The path passes Flemington Racecourse, where the Melbourne Cup is run on the first Tuesday of November each year as part of the Spring Racing Carnival.

It connects to the Steele Creek Trail on the north side of Buckley Street. Use the Buckley Street underpass just west of Lily Street. At Footscray, where Footscray Road crosses the Maribyrnong River over Shepherd Bridge, the trail splits in two. One path becomes the Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail. The other is a 2.8 km path, running along the south side of Footscray Road, which connects to the Capital City Trail. On weekends, on the Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail, a punt takes cyclists across the Yarra River under the West Gate Bridge at Spotswood near the Scienceworks Museum. A 3 km road section connects with Taylors Creek Trail in the north west. From the north end of Brimbank Park head north on Green Gully Road using the east side service road and then west on the Old Calder Highway using the service road on its south side. At the point where the Old Calder Highway and the Calder Freeway become close to each other, is a side street to the left (west), called Burrowye Crescent. The Taylors Creek Trail starts 500m down Burrowye Crescent on the right. North end at .

Ludlow also wrote about his travels across America on the overland stage to San Francisco, Yosemite and the forests of California and Oregon in his second book, The Heart of the Continent. An appendix to it provides his impressions of the recently founded Mormon settlement in Utah. He was also the author of many works of short fiction, essays, science reporting and art criticism. He devoted many of the last years of his life to attempts to improve the treatment of opiate addicts, becoming a pioneer in both progressive approaches dealing with addiction and the public portrayal of its sufferers. Though of modest means, he was imprudently generous in aiding those unable to cope with drug-induced life struggles. Ludlow died prematurely at the age of 34 from the accumulated effect of his lifelong addictions, the ravages of pneumonia and tuberculosis, and overwork. ==Early life== Fitz Hugh Ludlow was born September 11, 1836 in New York City, where his family made their home. His father, the Rev. Henry G. Ludlow, was an outspoken abolitionist minister at a time when anti-slavery enthusiasm was not popular, even in the urban North. Only months before his birth, Fitz Hugh later wrote, ‚Äúmy father, mother, and sister were driven from their house in New York by a furious mob. When they came cautiously back, their home was quiet as a fortress the day after it has been blown up. The front-parlor was full of paving-stones; the carpets were cut to pieces; the pictures, the furniture, and the chandelier lay in one common wreck; and the walls were covered with inscriptions of mingled insult and glory. Over the mantel-piece had been charcoaled ‚ÄòRascal‚Äô; over the pier-table, ‚ÄòAbolitionist.‚Äô‚ÄùLudlow, F.H. ‚ÄúIf Massa Put Guns Into Our Han‚Äôs‚Äù The Atlantic Monthly April 1865, p. 505, col. 1 His father was also a ‚Äúticket-agent on the Underground Railroad,‚Äù as Ludlow discovered when he was four ‚Äî although, misunderstanding the term in his youth, Ludlow remembered ‚Äúgoing down cellar and watching behind old hogsheads by the hour to see where the cars came in.‚Äù The moral lessons learned at home were principles hard to maintain among his peers, especially when expressed with his father's exuberance. > Among the large crowd of young Southerners sent to [my] school, I began > preaching emancipation in my pinafore. Mounted upon a window-seat in an > alcove of the great play-hall, I passed recess after recess in haranguing a > multitude upon the subject of Freedom, with as little success as most > apostles, and with only less than their crowd of martyrdom, because, though > small boys are more malicious than men, they cannot hit so hard.Ludlow, F.H. > ‚ÄúIf Massa Put Guns Into Our Han‚Äôs‚Äù The Atlantic Monthly April 1865, p. 507 Experiences like these may have inspired Ludlow in his first published work that has survived to this day. The poem, Truth on His Travels has ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù personified and wandering the earth, trying in vain to find some band of people who will respect him.Ludlow, F.H. ‚ÄúTruth on his Travels‚Äù The College Hill Mercury, 30 December 1850, pp. 90‚Äì91 The pages of The Hasheesh Eater introduce a bookish and near-sighted young Ludlow: ‚Äúinto books, ill health, and musing I settled down when I should have been playing cricket, hunting, or riding. The younger thirst for adventure was quenched by rapid degrees as I found it possible to ascend Chimborazo with Humboldt lying on a sofa, or chase harte-beests with Cumming over muffins and coffee.‚ÄùLudlow, F.H. ‚ÄúThe Hour and the Power of Darkness‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 A family legend, later used to explain his attraction for intoxicants, is that when Ludlow was two years old he ‚Äúwould climb upon the breakfast table and eat Cayenne pepper from the castor!‚ÄùCarpenter, Frank B. ‚ÄúIn Memoriam. ‚Äî Fitz Hugh Ludlow, as He Was Known by a Friend. ‚Äî Interesting and Fresh Personal Reminiscences. ‚Äî The Faithful Record of a Broken Career. ‚Äî Ludlow‚Äôs Weak and Strong Points‚Äù The Evening Mail, December ? 1870, col. 1 Henry Ludlow‚Äôs father was a pioneer temperance advocate, according to one source ‚Äúadopting and advocating its principles before any general and organized effort for them.‚ÄùFowler, P.H.

Henry himself, in one of his few preserved sermons, attacked Great Britain for ‚Äúher cruel oppression of her East India subjects, often starving... and forced to cultivate opium on land they need to supply themselves with bread...‚Äù and defended China ‚Äúfor resisting a traffick which was sapping, by its terrible effects upon her citizens, the very foundation of her empire...‚ÄùLudlow, Henry G. ‚ÄúOur Happy Form of Government: A Thanksgiving Sermon, preached in the Church Street Church, New Haven, November 19, 1840 by the pastor, H.G.

Abigail Woolsey Wells died a few months after Ludlow's twelfth birthday. At her funeral, the presiding minister said that ‚Äú[f]or many years she has scarcely known what physical ease and comfort were. She labored with a body prostrated and suffering; and laid herself down to sleep in pain.‚ÄùMandeville, Rev.

(Sermon preached on 2 March 1849) His mother's suffering may have brought out in Ludlow an obsession with mortality and the connection between the spiritual and animal in man. It was observed that ‚Äúthrough all her life [she] had a constitutional and indescribable dread of death; not so much the fear of being dead, as of dying itself. An appalling sense of the fearful struggle which separates the soul from the body.‚ÄùMandeville, Rev. Sumner ‚ÄúWeepers Instructed: A Sermon, Preached at the funeral of Mr. Abigail Woolsey Welles Ludlow, wife of the Rev. H.G. Ludlow‚Äù Poughkeepsie: Platt & Schram, 1849, p. 14 ==The college man== Though best associated with Union College, Ludlow began his studies at the College of New Jersey, today's Princeton University. Entering in 1854, he joined the Cliosophic Society, a literary and debating club. When a fire gutted Nassau Hall, the College of New Jersey's main building, a year later he transferred to Union. There he joined the Kappa Alpha Society, the nation's first purely social collegiate fraternity, and lived with its members.Niemeyer, Carl ‚ÄúFitz Hugh Ludlow and Union College‚Äù Union Worthies 8, Union College 1953 Ludlow evidently took some intensive courses in medicine at Union. As early as 1857, he writes of having been an anesthesiologist during minor surgery, and being asked by surgeons for his opinions on the actions of various courses of anesthesia.Ludlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Mysteries of the Life-sign Gemini‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 A class in which Ludlow always got the highest marks was one taught by famed Union College president Eliphalet Nott based on Lord Kames‚Äô seminal 1762 literary work, Elements of Criticism ‚Äì although it essentially became a course on Nott's own philosophy.Raymond, Andrew Van Vranken Union University: Its History, Influence, Characteristics and Equipment New York: Lewis Publishing Co., 1907 (3 vols.) p. 207 The eccentric polymath Nott would have an influence on Ludlow, but perhaps more immediately his assertion that ‚Äú[i]f I had it in my power to direct the making of songs in any country, I could do just as I pleased with the people.‚ÄùRaymond, Andrew Van Vranken Union University: Its History, Influence, Characteristics and Equipment New York: Lewis Publishing Co., 1907 (3 vols.) p. 210 In a testimony to Nott‚Äôs feelings towards Ludlow's philosophy and writing talent that he asked the young man to write a song for the commencement ceremony of the Class of 1856. College legend holds that Ludlow was so unhappy with the late night lyrics he composed to the tune of the drinking song Sparkling and Bright he threw away the manuscript. Fortuitously, his roommate discovered it and brought the work to Rev. Nott‚Äôs attention.‚ÄúUnion‚Äôs ‚ÄòAlma Mater‚Äô Song 100 Years Old This Spring‚Äù Union College News Release, 9 April 1956, p. 2 Song to Old Union became the school's alma mater, and is sung at commencement to this day.Union College commencement pamphlet, 23 July 1856 Ludlow wrote several college songs, two of which were considered the most popular Union College songs even fifty years later.Raymond, Andrew Van Vranken Union University: Its History, Influence, Characteristics and Equipment New York: Lewis Publishing Co., 1907 (3 vols.) p. 514-516. In The Hasheesh Eater he says that ‚Äú[h]e who should collect the college carols of our country... would be adding no mean department to the national literature... [T]hey are frequently both excellent poetry and music... [T]hey are always inspiring, always heart-blending, and always, I may add, well sung.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúTo-day, Zeus; to-morrow, Prometheus‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 ==The Hasheesh Eater== Ludlow is best known for his groundbreaking work The Hasheesh Eater, published in 1857. When, in the Song to Old Union, today‚Äôs graduates sing that ‚Äúthe brook that bounds through Union‚Äôs grounds / Gleams bright as the Delphic water...‚Äù most probably do not realize that they may be commemorating drug-induced states of vision, in which this bounding brook became alternatingly the Nile and the Styx. Early in his college years, probably during the spring of 1854 while Ludlow was still at Princeton, his medical curiosity drew him to visit his ‚Äúfriend Anderson the apothecary‚Äù regularly. During these visits, Ludlow ‚Äúmade upon myself the trial of the effects of every strange drug and chemical which the laboratory could produce.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Night Entrance‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 A few months before, Bayard Taylor‚Äôs Putnam‚Äôs Magazine article The Vision of HasheeshTaylor, Bayard ‚ÄúThe Vision of Hasheesh‚Äù Putnam‚Äôs Monthly Magazine, April 1854. had been devoured by Ludlow, and so when the cannabis-based tetanus remedy called Tilden‚Äôs extract came out he had to try some. Ludlow became a ‚Äúhasheesh eater,‚Äù ingesting large doses of this cannabis extract regularly throughout his college years. Just as in his youth he found to his delight that he could from the comfort of his couch adventure along with the words of authors, he found that with hasheesh ‚Äú[t]he whole East, from Greece to farthest China, lay within the compass of a township; no outlay was necessary for the journey. For the humble sum of six cents I might purchase an excursion ticket over all the earth; ships and dromedaries, tents and hospices were all contained in a box of Tilden‚Äôs extract.‚Äù He found the drug to be a boon to his creativity: ‚Äú[M]y pen glanced presently like lightning in the effort to keep neck and neck with my ideas,‚Äù he writes at one point, although, ‚Äú[a]t last, thought ran with such terrific speed that I could no longer write at all.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúNimium ‚Äî the Amreeta Cup of Unveiling‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 Although he later grew to think of cannabis as ‚Äúthe very witch- plant of hell, the weed of madness‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúVos non vobis ‚Äî wherein the Pythagorean is a By-stander‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 and his involvement with it as unwise, ‚Äú[w]herein I was wrong I was invited by a mother‚Äôs voice.... The motives for the hasheesh-indulgence were of the most exalted ideal nature, for of this nature are all its ecstasies and its revelations ‚Äî yes, and a thousand-fold more terrible, for this very reason, its unutterable pangs.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúCashmere and Cathay by Twilight‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater (1857) For a time he seemed never to be out from under the influence of hashish. ‚Äú[L]ife became with me one prolonged state of hasheesh exaltation...‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThen Seeva opened on the Accursed One his Eye of Anger‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 he wrote, and noted that ‚Äúthe effect of every successive indulgence grows more perduring until the hitherto isolated experiences become tangent to each other; then the links of the delirium intersect, and at last so blend that the chain has become a continuous band.... The final months... are passed in one unbroken yet checkered dream.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Night of Apotheosis‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 He concluded: > Hasheesh is indeed an accursed drug, and the soul at last pays a most bitter > price for all its ecstasies; moreover, the use of it is not the proper means > of gaining any insight, yet who shall say that at that season of exaltation > I did not know things as they are more truly than ever in the ordinary > state?.... In the jubilance of hashish, we have only arrived by an improper > pathway at the secret of that infinity of beauty which shall be beheld in > heaven and earth when the veil of the corporeal drops off, and we know as we > are known. Ludlow was earnest in his description of the horrors of withdrawal, adding that ‚Äú[i]f, from a human distaste of dwelling too long upon the horrible, I have been led to speak so lightly of the facts of this part of my experience that any man may think the returning way of ascent an easy one, and dare the downward road of ingress, I would repair the fault with whatever of painfully- elaborated prophecy of wretchedness may be in my power, for through all this time I was indeed a greater sufferer than any bodily pain could possibly make me.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Hell of Waters and the Hell of Treachery‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 Ludlow's account was probably flavored by the tale of opium addiction which formed the model for his book: Thomas DeQuincey‚Äôs Confessions of an English Opium-Eater. Ludlow‚Äôs description of his physical withdrawal symptoms included terrible nightmares. He takes up tobacco smoking to help him through his ‚Äúsuffering,‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúMy Stony Guardian‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 but this suffering seems mostly to be from disappointment at the dreary colors and unfantastic drudgery of sober life, rather than from any physical pain (ironically, his incipient nicotine addiction may have been the real source of any physical suffering he experienced; he writes at one point that ‚Äúto defer for an hour the nicotine indulgence was to bring on a longing for the cannabine which was actual pain.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúGrand Divertissement‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857): > The very existence of the outer world seemed a base mockery, a cruel sham of > some remembered possibility which had been glorious with a speechless > beauty. I hated flowers, for I had seen the enameled meads of Paradise; I > cursed the rocks because they were mute stone, the sky because it rang with > no music; and the earth and sky seemed to throw back my curse.... It was not > the ecstasy of the drug which so much attracted me, as its power of > disenthrallment from an apathy which no human aid could utterly take > away.Ludlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúLeaving the Schoolmaster, the Pythagorean Sets Up > For Himself‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 He says in The Hasheesh Eater that through the drug, ‚ÄúI had caught a glimpse through the chinks of my earthly prison of the immeasurable sky which should one day overarch me with unconceived sublimity of view, and resound in my ear with unutterable music.‚Äù This glimpse would haunt him for the rest of his days. A poem, preserved in his sister's notebook, reads in part: ‚ÄúI stand as one who from a dungeon dream / Of open air and the free arch of stars / Waking to things that be from things that seem / Beats madly on the bars. // I am not yet quite used to be aware / That all my labor & my hope had birth / Only to freeze me with the coffined share / Of void & soulless earth.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúI Did Not Ask That I Might Have a Name‚Äù (unpublished) The Hasheesh Eater was written on the advice of his physician during his withdrawal. Ludlow had difficulty in finding words to describe his experiences: ‚ÄúIn the hasheesh- eater a virtual change of worlds has taken place... Truth has not become expanded, but his vision has grown telescopic; that which others see only as the dim nebula, or do not see at all, he looks into with a penetrating scrutiny which distance, to a great extent, can not evade.... To his neighbor in the natural state he turns to give expression to his visions, but finds that to him the symbols which convey the apocalypse to his own mind are meaningless, because, in our ordinary life, the thoughts which they convey have no existence; their two planes are utterly different.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Book of Symbols‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater 1857 Still, he made the attempt, trying on the one hand to make a moral or practical point that ‚Äúthe soul withers and sinks from its growth toward the true end of its being beneath the dominance of any sensual indulgence‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater (1857) and on the other to map out the hashish high like an explorer of a new continent: ‚ÄúIf I shall seem to have fixed the comparative positions of even a few outposts of a strange and rarely-visited realm, I shall think myself happy.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúNotes on the Way Upward‚Äù The Hasheesh Eater (1857) ==Entering the New York literary scene== The Hasheesh Eater was published when Ludlow was twenty-one years old. The book was a success, going through a few printings in short order, and Ludlow, although he published both the book and his earlier article The Apocalypse of Hasheesh anonymously, was able to take advantage of the book's notoriety. For a time he studied law under William Curtis Noyes (himself a lawyer who had begun his legal studies at the age of fourteen in the offices of Ludlow's uncle Samuel). Ludlow passed the bar exam in New York in 1859, but never practiced law, instead deciding to pursue a literary career. The late 1850s marked a changing of the guard in New York City literature. Old guard literary magazines like The Knickerbocker and Putnam‚Äôs Monthly were fading away, and upstarts like the Atlantic Monthly, The Saturday Press, and Vanity Fair were starting up. Ludlow took on a position as an associate editor at Vanity Fair, a magazine which at the time resembled Punch in tone. It was probably through the Vanity Fair staff that Ludlow was introduced to the New York City bohemian and literary culture, centered around Pfaff's beer cellar on Broadway and Saturday night gatherings at Richard Henry Stoddard‚Äôs home.Smyth, Albert H. Bayard Taylor Detroit: Gale Research Co. 1970, pp. 137‚Äì8. See also: Howells, William Dean Literary Friends and Acquaintances... New York & London 1911, pp. 70‚Äì1. This scene attracted the likes of Walt Whitman, Fitz James O‚ÄôBrien, Bayard Taylor, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Edmund Clarence Stedman, and Artemus Ward. New York City‚Äôs vibrant literary scene and cosmopolitan attitudes were a boon to Ludlow. ‚ÄúIt is a bath of other souls,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt will not let a man harden inside his own epidermis. He must affect and be affected by multitudinous varieties of temperament, race, character.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe American Metropolis‚Äù The Atlantic Monthly January 1865, p. 87 New York was tolerant of iconoclasts and of people with just the sort of notoriety Ludlow had cultivated. ‚ÄúNo amount of eccentricity surprises a New-Yorker, or makes him uncourteous. It is difficult to attract even a crowd of boys on Broadway by an odd figure, face, manner, or costume. This has the result of making New York an asylum for all who love their neighbor as themselves, but would a little rather not have him looking through the key-hole.‚Äù The late 1850s and early 1860s found Ludlow in just about every literary quarter of New York. He wrote for, among many others, the Harper's publications (Weekly, Monthly and Bazar), the New York World, Commercial Advertiser, Evening Post, and Home Journal, and for Appleton‚Äôs, Vanity Fair, Knickerbocker, Northern Lights, The Saturday Press, and the Atlantic Monthly. George William Curtis, the editor of Harper‚Äôs New Monthly Magazine, remembered Ludlow as ‚Äúa slight, bright-eyed, alert young man, who seemed scarcely more than a boy,‚Äù when he came in for a visit.Curtis, George William ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Easy Chair‚Äù Harper‚Äôs New Monthly Magazine December 1870 Curtis introduced Ludlow to the princes of the Harper publishing family as an upcoming literary talent who, before his twenty-fifth birthday, would have his first book go through several printings and would place more than ten stories in Harper's publications, some of which were printed serially and spanned several issues. ==Rosalie== Ludlow's fictional stories often mirror with fair accuracy the events of his life. One can suppose that the childlike eighteen-year-old with brown hair and eyes and ‚Äúa complexion, marble struck through with rose flush‚Äù who falls for the narrator of Our Queer Papa, a young magazine sub-editor described as a ‚Äúgood-looking gentleman with brains, who had published,‚Äù is the fictionalized Rosalie Osborne, who follows that description, and whom he would marry the year after the story's publication.Ludlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúOur Queer Papa‚Äù Harper‚Äôs New Monthly Magazine November 1858 Rosalie was eighteen when she married, not particularly young by the standards of the day, but young enough in character that it would later be remembered that ‚Äúshe was... but a little girl when she was married.‚ÄùLetter from Carrie to her mother, 30 December 1864 Memoirs written by members of the New York literary circle in which the Ludlows were an active part universally paint Rosalie as both very beautiful and very flirtatious. The wife of Thomas Bailey Aldrich, for instance, remembered Mrs. Ludlow as ‚Äúthe Dulcinea who had entangled [Aldrich] in the meshes of her brown hair.‚ÄùAldrich, Mrs. Thomas Bailey Crowding Memories Boston & New York: Houghton Mifflin Company 1920, p. 22. The couple spent the first half of 1859 in Florida, where Ludlow wrote a series of articles, ‚ÄúDue South Sketches,‚Äù describing what he later recalled as ‚Äúthe climate of Utopia, the scenery of Paradise, and the social system of Hell.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúIf Massa Put Guns Into Our Han‚Äôs‚Äù The Atlantic Monthly April 1865, pp. 507‚Äì8 He noted that while apologists for slavery condemned abolitionists for condoning miscegenation, ‚Äú[t]he most open relations of concubinage existed between white chevaliers and black servants in the town of Jacksonville. I was not surprised at the fact, but was surprised at its openness.... not even the pious shrugged their shoulders or seemed to care.‚Äù From Florida, the couple moved to New York City, staying in a boarding house and diving rapidly back into the literary social life. ==The Heart of the Continent== In 1863 Albert Bierstadt was at the peak of a career that would make him America‚Äôs top landscape artist. Ludlow considered Bierstadt‚Äôs landscapes representative of the best American art of the era and used his position as art critic at the New York Evening Post to praise them. Bierstadt wanted to return West, where in 1859 he had found scenes for some of his recently successful paintings. He asked Ludlow to accompany him. Ludlow‚Äôs writings about the trip, published in the Post, San Francisco's The Golden Era, the Atlantic Monthly and then later compiled into book form, according to one biographer of Bierstadt, ‚Äúproved to be among the most effective vehicles in firmly establishing Bierstadt as the preeminent artist-interpreter of the western landscape in the 1860s.‚ÄùAnderson, Nancy K. & Ferber, Linda S. Albert Bierstadt: Art & Enterprise New York: Hudson Hills Press. During the overland journey, they stopped at Salt Lake City, where Ludlow found an industrious and sincere group of settlers. He brought to the city prejudice and misgiving about the Mormons, and a squeamishness about polygamy which embarrassed him almost as much as his first view of a household of multiple wives. ‚ÄúI, a cosmopolitan, a man of the world, liberal to other people‚Äôs habits and opinions to a degree which had often subjected me to censure among strictarians in the Eastern States, blushed to my very temples,‚Äù he writes.Ludlow, Fitz Hugh The Heart of the Continent 1870, p. 309 He couldn‚Äôt believe that a pair of co-wives ‚Äúcould sit there so demurely looking at their own and each other's babies without jumping up to tear each other's hair and scratch each other's eyes out... It would have relieved my mind... to have seen that happy family clawing each other like tigers.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúFirst Impressions of Mormondom‚Äù The Golden Era 20 March 1864 His impressions of the Mormons came when Utah was seen by many of his readers back home as rebellious and dangerous as those states in the Confederacy, with which the Union was then involved in the American Civil War. Ludlow encountered frequent snide comments about the disintegration of the Union, with some Mormons under the impression that with the flood of immigrants to Utah fleeing the draft, and with the decimation of the male population in war time making polygamy seem more practical, the Mormon state would come out of the war stronger than either side. Ludlow's opinions were read with interest back East, and would constitute an appendix to the book he would later write about his travels. ‚ÄúThe Mormon system,‚Äù wrote Ludlow, ‚Äúowns its believers ‚Äî they are for it, not it for them. I could not help regarding this ‚ÄòChurch‚Äô as a colossal steam engine which had suddenly realized its superiority over its engineers and... had declared once for all not only its independence but its despotism.‚Äù Furthermore, ‚Äú[i]t is very well known in Salt Lake City that no man lives there who would not be dead tomorrow if Brigham willed it so.‚Äù Ludlow spent considerable time with Orrin Porter Rockwell, who had been dubbed the ‚ÄúDestroying Angel‚Äù for his supposed role as Brigham Young's assassin of choice. Ludlow wrote a sketch of the man which Rockwell's biographer, Harold Schindler, called ‚Äúthe best of those left behind by writers who observed the Mormon first-hand.‚ÄùSchindler, Harold Orrin Porter Rockwell: Man of God, Son of Thunder (1983) p. 339 Ludlow said, in part, that he ‚Äúfound him one of the pleasantest murderers I ever met.‚Äù Ludlow wrote that ‚Äú[i]n their insane error, [the Mormons] are sincere, as I fully believe, to a much greater extent than is generally supposed. Even their leaders, for the most part, I regard not as hypocrites, but as fanatics.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúFirst Impressions of Mormondom‚Äù part II The Golden Era 27 March 1864 For instance, ‚ÄúBrigham Young is the farthest remove on earth from a hypocrite; he is that grand, yet awful sight in human nature, a man who has brought the loftiest Christian self- devotion to the altar of the Devil...‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúAmong the Mormons‚Äù Atlantic April 1864, p. 485, col. 2 A warning that must have seemed especially poignant was this: ‚Äú[T]he Mormon enemies of our American Idea should be plainly understood as far more dangerous antagonists than hypocrites or idiots can ever hope to be. Let us not twice commit the blunder of underrating our foes.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúAmong the Mormons‚Äù Atlantic April 1864, p. 488, col. 1‚Äì2 ===Racist opinions=== Ludlow occasionally expressed the racial bigotry rampant throughout his day in his writings. Contrary to his progressive nature, inquiring mind, and abolitionist politics, describes ‚Äúmotherly mulatto woman‚Äù as possessing ‚Äúthe passive obedience of her race;‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Household Angel‚Äù Harper‚Äôs Bazar 30 May 1868, p. 493 or Mexicans in California as originating from ‚Äúa nation of beggars-on-horseback... the Spaniards, Greasers, and Mixed-Breeds...;‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúSeven Weeks in the Great Yo-Semite‚Äù Atlantic June 1864, p. 741, col. 1 or Chinese immigrants in ‚Äúa kennel of straggling houses‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúOn Horseback into Oregon‚Äù Atlantic July 1864, p. 85 with Ludlow imagining them ‚Äúfinally... swept away from San Francisco, and that strange Semitic race... either exiled or swallowed up in our civilization...;‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúHow it Strikes One‚Äù (Plain Talks ‚Äî No. 2) The Golden Era 20 December 1863 or ‚Äúthe natural, ingrained laziness of the Indians.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúOn the Columbia River‚Äù Atlantic December 1864, p. 707 Native Americans were a particular target, calling them ‚Äúcopper-faced devils‚Äù, and he looking with scorn on ‚Äúthe pretty, sentimental, philanthropic prayers‚Äù that constituted much of the contemporary literature about the ‚Äúnoble savage.‚Äù Ludlow believed the ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù was subhuman ‚Äî an ‚Äúinconceivable devil, whom statesmen and fools treat with, but whom brave and practical men shoot and scalp.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúSalt Lake City to San Francisco‚Äù The Golden Era 17 April 1864 ===San Francisco=== During his stay in San Francisco, Ludlow was a guest of Thomas Starr King, the youthful California preacher and passionate public speaker. There, Ludlow again found himself in a vibrant literary community, this time centered around the Golden Era, which published Mark Twain, Joaquin Miller and Bret Harte. Twain was at the time still a virtual unknown (he had first used the pen name ‚ÄúMark Twain‚Äù in a published piece a few months before). Ludlow wrote that ‚Äú[i]n funny literature, that Irresistable [sic] Washoe Giant, Mark Twain, takes quite a unique position.... He imitates nobody. He is a school by himself.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúA Good-bye Article‚Äù The Golden Era 22 November 1863, col. 5 Twain reciprocated by asking Ludlow to preview some of his work,Bishop, Morris ‚ÄúFitz Hugh Ludlow‚Äù Union Worthies 8, Union College, 1953, p. 16 and wrote to his mother, ‚Äúif Fitz Hugh Ludlow, (author of ‚ÄòThe Hasheesh Eater‚Äô) comes your way, treat him well.... He published a high encomium upon Mark Twain, (the same being eminently just & truthful, I beseech you to believe) in a San Francisco paper. Artemus Ward said that when my gorgeous talents were publicly acknowledged by such high authority, I ought to appreciate them myself...‚ÄùClemens, Samuel, letter to Jane Lampton Clemens, 2? January 1864, in Mark Twain‚Äôs Letters Berkeley: University of California Press 1988, p. 268 Ludlow also observed the ravages of opium addiction among the Chinese immigrant population in San Francisco: > I shall never forget till my dying day that awful Chinese face which > actually made me rein my horse at the door of the opium hong where it > appeared, after a night‚Äôs debauch, at six o‚Äôclock one morning.... It spoke > of such a nameless horror in its owner‚Äôs soul that I made the sign for a > pipe and proposed, in ‚Äúpigeon English,‚Äù to furnish the necessary coin. The > Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing medicine > proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot, and made a gesture, > palms downward, toward the ground, as one who said, ‚ÄúIt has done its last > for me ‚Äî I am paying the matured bills of penalty.‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúWhat > Shall They Do To Be Saved?‚Äù Harper‚Äôs New Monthly Magazine August 1867, pp. > 377‚Äì387 From San Francisco, Bierstadt and Ludlow ventured to Yosemite, then to Mount Shasta, and then into Oregon, where Ludlow was struck ‚Äúby a violent attack of pneumonia, which came near terminating my earthly with my Oregon pilgrimage‚ÄùLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Prisoners of Portland: An Historical Novel of the Present, Past and Future: In two short (may its readers echo ‚Äòtoo short!‚Äô) books ‚Äî and no chapters whatsoever: Doleful, Damp, and Dramatic‚Äù The Golden Era 12 June & 19 June 1864 and which stopped their wandering for the better part of a week. By late in 1864, after Ludlow's return to New York City, his marriage was in trouble. The reasons for the strife are unknown, but surviving letters suggest a mutual and scandal-provoking flood of infidelity. Rosalie obtained a divorce in May 1866. She would, a few months later, marry Albert Bierstadt. Ludlow meanwhile was again trying to kick a drug addiction, but he quickly started up a relationship with Maria O. Milliken, of whom little is known except that she was ten years his senior and had children of her own. They were married shortly after Rosalie's marriage to Bierstadt. ==New York stories== There was little in the field of literature that Ludlow did not feel qualified to attempt. He wrote stories for the magazines of his day, poetry, political commentary, art-, music-, drama-, and literary- criticism, and science and medical writing. As a newspaper writer, he also translated articles from foreign newspapers. Most of his stories were light- hearted romances, sprinkled with characters like ‚ÄúMr. W. Dubbleyew,‚Äù or ‚ÄúMajor Highjinks,‚Äù and generally concerning some semi-ridiculous obstacle that comes between the narrator and a beautiful young woman he's fallen in love with. Occasional stories break from this pattern: ===The Phial of Dread=== The Phial of DreadLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Phial of Dread: By an Analytic Chemist‚Äù Harper‚Äôs New Monthly Magazine 19(108) October 1859 was one of Ludlow's earliest magazine stories, published in October 1859. It is written as the journal of a chemist who is visited in his laboratory by the insane daughter of an acquaintance, who felt herself pursued by Death. When she got to the lab, she immediately sought out some chemical with which she could kill herself: > We were alone together among the strange poisons, each one of whom, with a > quicker or a slower death-devil in his eye, sat in his glass or porcelain > sentry-box, a living force of bale. Should it be Hemp? No, that was too > slow, uncertain, painful. Morphine? Too many antidotes ‚Äî too much > commonness, ostentation in that. Daturin? I did not like to ask how much of > that was certain... She finally stabs herself in the heart with a knife she finds in the lab. The author of the journal, Edgar Sands, panics, fearing that he will be blamed for the death, and attempts to destroy the body, > ...he went calmly to work, with an awful despair in his eyes, and cut the > shell of me ‚Äî the husk I had left ‚Äî to pieces; as a surgeon would, on a > table in the laboratory. These fragments he screwed down into a large > retort, and placed in the fiercest of flames, fed with pure oxygen.... I > knew that all of me that had been seen on earth was reducing there to its > ultimates ‚Äî I was distilled there by degrees. Her soul becomes trapped in the vial in which he pours the last drops of this substance, and he in turn is tormented by the presence he sees as a small, tortured woman within the vial. She is, however, able to take over his body with her soul long enough to write the confession from which the above excerpts come. This saves Mr. Sands from capital punishment, but he notes that the last pages of his journal were ‚Äúwritten... after I was discharged from Bloomingdale Insane Asylum.‚Äù ===The Music Essence=== The Music Essence,Ludlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Music Essence‚Äù The Commercial Advertiser 31 December 1861 printed in 1861 by The Commercial Advertiser, featured a man who composes a symphony for his deaf wife by translating the musical notes into light and colors. This story was certainly inspired by the synesthesia Ludlow experienced during his hashish experiences, of which he wrote that: > The soul is sometimes plainly perceived to be but one in its own sensorium, > while the body is understood to be all that so variously modifies > impressions as to make them in the one instance smell, in another taste, > another sight, and thus on, ad finem. Thus the hasheesh-eater knows what it > is to be burned by salt fire, to smell colors, to see sounds, and, much more > frequently, to see feelings. ===John Heathburn's Title=== John Heathburn‚Äôs TitleLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúJohn Heathburn‚Äôs Title: A Tale in Two Parts‚Äù Harper‚Äôs New Monthly Magazine 28(165 & 166), February & March 1864 (1864) concerns an opium and alcohol addict who is cured through the patience of a concerned physician, and through a substitution therapy utilizing a cannabis extract. It represents Ludlow's first published discussion of his role as a physician treating opium addicts. ===The Household Angel=== The Household AngelLudlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúThe Household Angel‚Äù Harper‚Äôs Bazar May 30 August 22, 1868 was published over a series of thirteen issues of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar in 1868, and is a soap opera of betrayal, deceit, and the descent of a likable protagonist into alcoholism and despair. ===Cinderella=== Ludlow's sole foray into drama was an adaptation of Cinderella which he wrote for the New York City Sanitary Fair in 1864, an enormous affair to benefit the National Sanitary Commission in their war- relief efforts. The play was performed by children, under the direction of the wife of General John C. Fremont (and starring their son), and included two shetland ponies.‚ÄúThe Children‚Äôs Gift to the N.Y. Sanitary Fair ‚Äî ‚ÄòCinderella‚Äô‚Äù The Golden Era 29 May 1864; Google Books edition of the play ===‚ÄúE Pluribus Unum‚Äù=== Among the more interesting of Ludlow's articles was ‚ÄúE Pluribus Unum‚Äù,Ludlow, Fitz Hugh ‚Äú‚ÄòE Pluribus Unum‚Äô‚Äù The Galaxy 2, 1 November 1866 published in The Galaxy in November 1866. It reviews attempts by pre- relativistic physicists to unify the known forces into a single force. It is occasionally anachronistic, as when Ludlow reviews failed attempts to explain the enormous energy radiated from the sun using classical physics, eventually settling on the heat given off by incoming meteor collisions as the most likely explanation. And it is occasionally visionary, as when Ludlow, decades before Albert Einstein would do the same, abandons the idea of the √¶ther and muses that ‚Äú[w]e might be allowed to... assert that because our only cognitions of matter are cognitions of force, matter in the scientific sense is force.‚Äù He does not elaborate, and evidently the article was altered and cut for publication substantially, so we are left to wonder how far he pursued this idea of the equivalency of matter and energy. ===Homes for the Friendless=== One of the last published pieces by Ludlow was written for the New York Tribune, and published early in the year of his death. Probably prompted by his work with destitute opiate addicts, the article, ‚ÄúHomes for the Friendless,‚Äù advocated the establishment of homeless shelters in New York City, particularly for alcoholics and other drug addicts, noting that the existing shelters served women and children only, and that there was a growing class of homeless men in need of assistance. The idea was enthusiastically endorsed in an editorial by Tribune editor Horace Greeley. ==Final years== The last years of Ludlow's life seem to have been a constant struggle with addiction. Family letters, when they mention him, usually either hopefully discuss his latest release from habit or mourn his latest relapse. His cousin wrote in March 1870, that ‚ÄúDr. Smith has been treating him for a while but he said to a lady the other day ‚Äî that there was no use in his wasting his strength [treating] Mr. Ludlow, for he took a teaspoonful of morphine in a glass of whisky every day ‚Äî and while he persisted in doing that it was only time & strength thrown away...‚ÄùLetter from Carrie to her mother, 8 March 1870 His writing focus, as well as the focus of his life, turned to the problem of opium addiction. He described this as ‚Äúone of my life‚Äôs ruling passions ‚Äî a very agony of seeking to find ‚Äî any means of bringing the habituated opium- eater out of his horrible bondage, without, or comparatively without, pain.‚Äù His essay What Shall They Do to be Saved from Harper‚Äôs was included in the 1868 book (written by Horace Day, himself a recovering addict) The Opium Habit,Day, Horace The Opium Habit NY: Harper & Brothers 1868 one of the first books to deal in a medical way with opium addiction, which had become a national crisis in the wake of the Civil War. Ludlow expanded on his original essay with Outlines of the Opium Cure,Ludlow, Fitz Hugh ‚ÄúOutlines of the Opium Cure‚Äù in Day, Horace The Opium Habit NY: Harper & Brothers 1868, pp. 285‚Äì335 a portrait in words of an ideal, perhaps utopian, drug addiction treatment clinic. The opium addict, according to Ludlow (in a view which even today seems progressive), ‚Äúis a proper subject, not for reproof, but for medical treatment. The problem of his case need embarrass nobody. It is as purely physical as one of smallpox.... [He] is suffering under a disease of the very machinery of volition; and no more to be judged harshly for his acts than a wound for suppurating or the bowels for continuing the peristaltic motion.‚Äù Ludlow's writings led addicts from all over the country to write for advice, and he spent a great deal of time in his last years answering this correspondence. He also treated addicts as a physician, and one friend said that ‚ÄúI have known him to go for three weeks at a time without taking off his clothing for sleep, in attendance upon the sick. His face was a familiar one in many a hospital ward.... During the last weeks of his residence in New York, he supported, out of his scanty means, a family of which one of the members had been a victim to opium. This family had no claim upon him whatever excepting that of the sympathy which such misfortunes always excited in him. The medicines and money he furnished this single family in the course of the several weeks that I knew about them, could not have amounted to less than one hundred dollars, and this case was only one of many.‚Äù But Ludlow himself was unable to break the habit. The same friend writes, > Alas, with what sadness his friends came to know that while he was doing so > much to warn and restore others from the effects of this fearful habit, he > himself was still under its bondage. Again and again he seemed to have > broken it. Only those most intimate with him knew how he suffered at such > periods... I recall a night he passed with me some months after the > publication of [What Shall They Do to Be Saved?]. He was in an excited > state, and we took a long walk together, during which he spoke freely of his > varied trials, and he finally went to my house to sleep. I went directly to > bed, but he was a long time making his preparations, and I at length > suspected he was indulging his old craving. For the first and only time in > my life I spoke harshly to him, and characterized his abuse of himself and > of the confidence of his friends as shameful. He replied depreciatingly, and > turning down the gas-light came around and crept into bed beside me. We both > lay a moment in silence, and feeling reproved for my harshness, I said: > ‚ÄúThink, Fitz, of your warnings on the subject, and of your effort, in behalf > of other victims.‚Äù In a tone and with a pathos I can never forget, he > answered ‚Äî ‚ÄúHe saved others, himself he could not save.‚Äù Ludlow left for Europe in June 1870 in an attempt to recover, both from his addictions and from tuberculosis. He travelled from New York with his sister Helen, who had been a constant source of support, and his wife, Maria, and one of her sons. They stayed for a month and a half in London, then left for Geneva, Switzerland when his health again took a downturn. He died the morning after his thirty-fourth birthday, and, perhaps as he meant to predict in this passage in What Shall They Do to Be Saved?: ‚ÄúOver the opium-eater‚Äôs coffin at least, thank God! a wife and a sister can stop weeping and say, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs free.‚Äô‚Äù ==See also== * Fitz Hugh Ludlow Memorial Library ==Notes== ==Sources== *A Brief Biography of Fitz Hugh Ludlow (1995 David Gross) ==Further reading== *Appleton‚Äôs Cyclopedia of American Biography: Fitz Hugh Ludlow *Pioneer of Inner Space: The Life of Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Hasheesh Eater by Donald P.

He was the son of Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk and Lady Anne Somerset, daughter of Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester and Elizabeth Dormer. He was summoned to the House of Lords in his own right as Baron Mowbray in 1678. His unhappy marriage was a subject of much gossip, and ended in divorce. ==Marriage, separation and divorce== He married Mary Mordaunt, the only surviving daughter and heiress of the 2nd Earl of Peterborough and Penelope O'Brien. They separated in 1685. He divorced her for her adultery with Sir John Germain in 1700, after a previous attempt at divorce in 1692 had failed when the House of Lords threw out his private Divorce Bill. Although he succeeded in obtaining damages in an action for criminal conversation, the details were so sordid that he may well have regretted the step, especially since the jury reduced his claim for ¬£100,000 damages to ¬£66, for which they were severely reprimanded by the presiding judge. The Duke was evidently in no position to condemn his wife's conduct: even his own counsel called it frankly a case of the pot calling the kettle black. He died without children, and was succeeded by his nephew, Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk. His former wife married secondly Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet, who had been her lover for many years. She died in 1705. He was rarely on good terms with his father, particularly after 1677 when his father married Jane Bickerton, his mistress of many years standing, an act which caused a violent family quarrel.Kenyon, J.P.

The ploy seems to have succeeded; although his father was charged with recusancy in 1680, the charge was quickly dropped. While the senior Howard line survived unscathed, their cousin William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, was executed for his supposed part in the Plot in December 1680.Kenyon p.232 Henry as a peer in his own right, Baron Mowbray, sat as one of the peers who tried him. It is a sign of his moral courage and independent judgment, given the anti-Catholic feeling in the country, that he voted Not Guilty. This was the more notable since according to John Evelyn, of Stafford's extended family in the House of Lords, (eight of them in all), he was the only one to do so, Stafford being a man \\"not beloved by his family\\".Evelyn Diary 7 December 1680 He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1672. His father was already a fellow and was a generous benefactor of the Society. On 20 June 1685, he was appointed Colonel of the Suffolk Regiment, which at the time was called the Duke of Norfolk's Regiment of Foot. He was created a Knight of the Garter in the same year. As a man \\"all-powerful in his Dukedom\\"Kenyon, J.P. The Stuart Constitution 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press p.447 he used his influence in the 1685 General Election to return members entirely loyal to the Crown (as his father had in 1673 when he found a safe seat at Castle Rising for Samuel Pepys). By 1688, however, he was on bad terms with James II, openly disapproving of the King's aggressive policy of Catholic championship. When asked to question his constituents on whether they favoured repeal of the Test Act, he replied bluntly that he knew that all those in favour of repeal would fit comfortably in one coach.Kenyon, J.P.

The first HMS Norfolk was named after him. He served as a Privy Councillor under William III and Mary II in 1689. At first, he refused to take the oath necessary to sit in the House of Lords, since although he had publicly conformed to the Anglican rite, it was no secret that he remained a Roman Catholic at heart; but after a few months he subscribed to the oath.

Rubber cement (cow gum in British English) is an adhesive made from elastic polymers (typically latex) mixed in a solvent such as acetone, hexane, heptane or toluene to keep it fluid enough to be used. This makes it part of the class of drying adhesives: as the solvents quickly evaporate, the rubber solidifies, forming a strong yet flexible bond. == Composition == Rubber cement is simply a mixture of solid rubber in a volatile solvent that will dissolve it. When the cement is applied, the solvent evaporates, leaving the rubber as the adhesive. Almost any rubber (pre-vulcanized or not) can be used. The rubbers used might be natural rubber, gum mastic or gum arabic. Early solvents used included chloroform and benzene. A small percentage of alcohol is often added to the mix. In the United States of America, current formulations include n-heptane. In the UK, a product called Marabu-Fixogum uses acetone, while a product called Copydex uses ammonia. Many special compositions include hardeners and/or vulcanizing agents designed to improve the cohesion of the rubber. Water-based formulae, often stabilised by ammonia, are also available. == Usage == Rubber cement is favoured in handicrafts applications, where easy and damage-free removal of adhesive is desired. For example, rubber cement is used as the marking fluid in erasable pens. Because rubber cements are designed to peel easily or rub off without damaging the paper or leaving any trace of adhesive behind, they are ideal for use in paste-up work where excess cement might need to be removed. It also does not become brittle like paste does. Older formula rubber cements are not considered an archivally sound adhesive because of their low pH value (making them acidic) and will cause deterioration of photographs and paper over time. Today's rubber cements are acid-free, making them ideal for archival purposes. Rubber cement thinners are also available, and are used to replace the solvent that evaporates from the container or to remove residual adhesive. == Hazards == The solvents used in rubber cement present some hazards, including flammability and potential for abuse as inhalants. Therefore, as with any adhesive containing solvents, rubber cement should be used in an open area. Also, care needs be taken to avoid heat sources, as n-heptane and n-hexane are highly flammable. Rubber cement and rubber cement thinners that contain acetone will damage polished surfaces and many plastics.Actio Software Corporation (2007). Devcon - Rubber Cement.

He was Edmonton's first native-born mayor. ==Early life== Cavanagh was born in Edmonton on July 19, 1926, to recent Scottish immigrants. He attended high school in Edmonton before moving to Galt, Ontario to play hockey for the Galt Red Wings of the Ontario Hockey Association, where he was a teammate of Gordie Howe. After stints with the Dallas Texans of the United States Hockey League, the Valleyfield Braves of the Quebec Senior Hockey League, and the Los Angeles Ramblers and the Trail Smoke Eaters of the Western International Hockey League, he retired from hockey and found employment in the purchasing department of Consolidated Mining and Smelting Co. in Trail, British Columbia. Cavanagh married June Gould on April 12, 1948; the couple would have three children, and June would herself serve as an Edmonton alderman from 1980 to 1983 for Ward 3. In 1957, he returned to Edmonton to work as the purchasing manager for Premier Steel Mills Ltd. He stayed on when the company was taken over by Stelco Steel in 1962, and remained in the position until 1977. ==Political career== ===Early career and hiatus=== Cavanagh entered politics during the 1968 Edmonton election, when he ran for Edmonton City Council as an alderman. He was defeated, finishing fourteenth of thirty-two candidates in an election in which the top twelve were elected. He was more successful during the 1971 election; Edmonton had adopted a ward system (in which three aldermen were elected in each of four wards) to replace the previous at-large method of election, and Cavanagh placed second of seventeen candidates in Ward 4. He was re-elected in the 1974 election, when he placed first of nine candidates. On November 7, 1975, mayor William Hawrelak died in office. After nine ballots, Council chose Cavanagh over Laurence Decore to serve out his term,\\"Edmonton council elects Cavanagh as mayor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, November 15, 1975, p. 6. but when ran to retain the position in the 1977 election, he finished third, nearly ten thousand votes behind victor Cec Purves and under a thousand behind Decore (he did finish well ahead of former mayor Ivor Dent, however). He stayed out of politics for six years following this defeat, serving as chair of the Government of Alberta's Alberta Rent Decontrol Appeal Board (tasked with the elimination of provincial rent controls) from 1977‚Äì80 and as a communications advisor for the Alberta Energy Company Ltd. from 1980‚Äì84. He rejected overtures from Neil Stanley Crawford to run for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative, commenting later that he had little interest in sitting as a backbencher after serving as mayor of Edmonton, and that Premier Peter Lougheed had not been prepared to promise him a cabinet position. ===Return to council=== He returned to Council after the 1983 election, when he finished second of eight candidates in Ward 6 (Edmonton's ward system had been revised such that there were two aldermen elected from each of six wards). He was re-elected in the 1986 election, placing first of nine candidates. In 1988, Decore (who had been elected mayor in 1983) resigned to take a position as leader of the Alberta Liberal Party. Again Council chose Cavanagh to serve as interim mayor, and again he was defeated soundly when he sought re-election \\\\- this time, he finished with fewer than half the votes of Jan Reimer during the 1989 municipal election. He would win his old aldermanic seat back in the 1992 election, and would be re- elected in the 1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004 elections. In May 2007, Cavanagh announced that he would not seek election in the 2007 municipal election. ===Political views, initiatives, and reputation=== Cavanagh had excellent ties with Edmonton's immigrant and especially Chinese communities. Members of the Chinese community threw him a dinner for his eightieth birthday, and he claims that he can say \\"vote for me\\" in \\"15 or 17 languages\\". He was an advocate for the development of Edmonton's North Saskatchewan River valley as a park area, despite the fact that he is not generally known as an environmentalist. Cavanagh also played a significant role in having the Hotel Macdonald designated a Municipal Heritage Resource in 1985, saving it from destruction. In 2015 a meeting room in the hotel was named after him, with his family donating a portrait of Cavanagh to hang in it. Despite his experience in removing rent controls during the 1970s, he urged Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach to consider reintroducing them during Alberta's recent economic boom and accompanying tight housing market. ==Personal life and extra-political involvement== Cavanagh was a communications instructor, and taught courses on the subject at Victoria Composite High School, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (where he also taught a purchasing management course), and the University of Alberta's Faculty of Extension. He also taught a government relations course at Grant MacEwan College. Cavanagh died in December 2017 at the age of 91.Former Edmonton mayor Terry Cavanagh dies at 91 ==References== *Terry Cavanagh profile Edmonton City Council (retrieved August 14, 2007) *Edmonton Public Library biography of Terry Cavanagh * *\\"Budgeting Time\\", Real Estate Weekly, November 23, 2006 *\\"Keep rent-control plan alive, say councillors\\", Edmonton Journal, May 6, 2007 *\\"Edmonton then, Edmonton now\\", Edmonton Journal, June 23, 2007 (reproduced on connect2edmonton.ca) Category:1926 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Edmonton Category:Canadian educators Category:Canadian ice hockey forwards Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent Category:Canadian sportsperson- politicians Category:Dallas Texans (USHL) players Category:Galt Red Wings players Category:Ice hockey people from Alberta Category:MacEwan University faculty Category:Mayors of Edmonton Category:Sportspeople from Edmonton ","title":"Terry Cavanagh (politician)"},{"id":"1432462","text":"National Cathedral School (NCS) is an independent Episcopal private day school for girls in grades 4-12 located on the grounds of the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., United States.

It is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, situated on a long, narrow bay. Because of its sheltered position between mountain ridges, the climate is unusually dry. At the 2015 census Palu had a population of around 367,600, not including those living in neighboring regencies. On 28 September 2018, the city suffered many casualties due to a tsunami, where at least 2,256 people lost their lives, while many others are still buried under the rubble and presumed dead. == Etymology == The name of Palu comes from the word Topalu'e (the elevated land) because this area was meant to be the ocean. There was an earthquake and plate shift (palu koro) so that the area that was once the sea was lifted and formed the land that is now Palu. Another source mentions that the word origin of Palu comes from the Kaili word Volo, a term of bamboo that grows from the Tawaeli area to the Sigi region. Bamboo is very closely related to the Kaili tribe, this is due to they dependence of bamboo usage as their daily needs, whether it be used as foodstuffs (bamboo shoot), building materials (walls, mats, etc.), daily equipment, games (tilako), as well as musical instruments (lalove). ==History== The palace of the princes of Palu The Dutch controleur's residence in the 1930s Palu originated from a unity of four villages; namely Besusu, Tanggabanggo (Siranindi, now Kamonji), Panggovia (now Lere) and Boyantongo (now Kelurahan Baru). They formed a customary council called Patanggota. One of their assignments was to elect the king and his assistants for royal activities. The kingdom, which would be known as the Palu Kingdom, eventually became one of the well-known and very powerful kingdom. The Dutch first visited Palu during the reign of King Maili (Mangge Risa) to get protection from Manado in 1868. In 1888, the Dutch governor of Celebes together with armies and several ships arrived Palu kingdom, they fought in Kayumalue. After the Kayumalue war, King Maili was killed by the Dutch and his body was brought to Palu. He was succeeded by King Jodjokodi, on 1 May 1888 he signed a short agreement to the Dutch East Indies colonial authority. The town was part of the Dutch Empire until Indonesia won independence in 1945‚Äì49. The Dutch controleurs house survives as a testament of that era. ===CIA air raids=== In April 1958 during the Permesta rebellion in North Sulawesi, the USA supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a CIA Taiwan-based front organization, \\"Civil Air Transport,\\" flew CIA B-26 Invader aircraft, repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned targets in and around Palu; destroying vehicles, buildings, a bridge and a ship. ===2005 earthquake=== On 24 January 2005 at 04:10 (UTC+8), an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 occurred in the city. According to the local meteorological office, the epicenter of the earthquake was around 1.249¬∞ S, 119.922¬∞ E, some southeast of Palu at the depth of of Bora Village's hot spring, Biromaru sub-district, Donggala Regency. Panic ensued as most people sought refuge in the highlands for fear of a repeat disaster like the tsunami as occurred in Aceh. The earthquake killed one person, injured four others, and destroyed 177 buildings. ===2005 market bombing=== On 31 December 2005 at about 07:35 (UTC +8) a bomb blast, described as a nail bomb or similar, detonated around 07:00 in a butcher's market mostly frequented by Christian Minahasa shopping for New Year's Eve celebrations, killing eight people and wounding another 53. ===2018 tsunami=== On 28 September 2018, Palu was hit by a 5-meter-high tsunami shortly after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred 80 km north of the city. The earthquake killed 1,705 people, with 1,549 injured and 832 missing in the city. Other cities were also struck by the tsunami. As of 2019, the death toll has reached 4,340 as reported by the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, over 4 places that were hit by the tsunami. ==Climate== Palu has a relatively dry tropical rainforest climate (Af) due to the strong rainshadow of the nearby mountains. == Administration == The city was divided at 2010 into four districts (kecamatan), tabulated below with their 2010 Census population.Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. { class=\\"sortable \\" - !

Sunburst is a style of finishing for musical instruments such as electric and acoustic guitars and electric basses. At the center of a sunburst-finished surface is an area of lighter color (often showing the wood grain underneath) that darkens gradually towards the edges before hitting a dark rim. Among the best known examples of a sunburst finish are the Gibson Les Paul guitars and the Fender Stratocaster. It was originally intended to imitate an aged German finish, as applied to classical string instruments such as violins, as well as to enable the use of wood with less attractive edge grain on high-end instruments. Some vintage mandolins made by Gibson actually had a burst style finish achieved with stain that was wiped on to the top of the instrument and sometimes the back as well but sprayed tinted nitrocellulose lacquer later proved to be a faster way to achieve a burst finish. There are various types of sunburst finishes. Some common types include \\"vintage sunburst\\", which is golden yellow in the very center and black around the edges, \\"cherry sunburst\\" - which is a golden yellow at the very center and cherry red towards the edges, \\"tobacco sunburst\\", which is golden yellow in the very center and brown around the edges, and \\"three-color sunburst,\\" which fades from golden yellow at the center through a layer of red and finally to black around the edges. The finish is often transparent in order to show, and accentuate, attractively-patterned wood or wood veneers such as flame maple, but may be opaque where the wood is not strongly figured, such as basswood or alder. Other sunburst varieties over the years included \\"Sienna Sunburst\\" and \\"Blue Burst\\", first introduced by Harmon in the late '70s and mid '80s. The American Series Strat HSS and the Strat Plus guitars are examples. The British Burns company use greenburst finishes on a number of their guitars, such as the Steer and Scorpion. There are also aged variants of sunburst finishes which are usually found on high-end boutique instruments from Fender, Suhr, Tom Anderson, Melancon, Don Grosh and James Tyler, such as Aged Cherry Burst, Fireburst, Lightburst and Antique Tobacco Sunburst. These aged sunburst finishes are mostly suited for quilted, spalted and flamed maple tops, as well with other highly figured woods such as swamp ash and koa. ==References== Category:Woodworking Category:Lutherie ","title":"Sunburst (finish)"},{"id":"1432489","text":"Malvina Reynolds (August 23, 1900 ‚Äì March 17, 1978) was an American folk/blues singer-songwriter and political activist, best known for her songwriting, particularly the songs \\"Little Boxes\\" and \\"What Have They Done to the Rain.\\"Biography at Western Kentucky University by Charles H. Smith and Nancy Schimmel ‚Äì Accessed Nov 2006 ==Early life== Malvina Milder was born in San Francisco to David and Abagail Milder, Jewish and socialist immigrants, who opposed involvement in World War I. She married William (\\"Bud\\") Reynolds, a carpenter and labor organizer, in 1934. They had one child, Nancy Reynolds Schimmel (a songwriter and performer), in 1935. Malvina earned her Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in English from the University of California, Berkeley, and later earned a doctorate there, finishing her dissertation in 1938. ==Music career== Though she played violin in a dance band in her twenties, Reynolds began her songwriting career late in life. She was in her late forties when she met Earl Robinson, Pete Seeger, and other folk singers and songwriters. She returned to school at UC Berkeley, where she studied music theory. Reynolds went on to write several popular songs, including \\"Little Boxes\\" (1962), recorded by Seeger and others, \\"What Have They Done to the Rain\\" (1962), recorded by The Searchers, The Seekers, Marianne Faithfull, Melanie Safka and Joan Baez (about nuclear fallout), \\"It Isn't Nice\\" (1964) (a civil rights anthem), \\"Turn Around\\" (1959) (about children growing up, later sung by Harry Belafonte), and \\"There's a Bottom Below\\" (about depression). Reynolds was also a noted composer of children's songs, including \\"Magic Penny\\" and \\"Morningtown Ride\\" (1957), a top-5 UK single (December 1966) recorded by The Seekers. Malvina lived on Parker Street in Berkeley. Four collections of Reynolds' music are available on compact disc. The Smithsonian Folkways label released Another County Heard From (Folkways 02524) and Ear to the Ground (Smithsonian Folkways 40124), and the Omni Recording Corporation in Australia issued Malvina Reynolds (Omni 112) and Malvina Reynolds Sings the Truth (Omni 114). A film biography, Love It Like a Fool, was made (1977) a year before she died in 1978. Reynolds' most famous song, \\"Little Boxes\\" (made famous by Seeger), has enjoyed renewed popularity by being featured in Showtime's TV series Weeds. \\"Little Boxes\\" was inspired visually by the houses of Daly City, California.

WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. ==Other== In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Reynolds's name and picture.

In Australia, Paterson was involved in business ventures in Melbourne and Queensland, gaining enough stature in Queensland to be elected to the inaugural Australian parliament. Paterson contested the seat of Capricornia in the 1901 Federal election, winning by a margin of 139 votes over the ALP candidate Wallace Nelson. On 15 June 1901, during the first parliament of the Commonwealth, the Immigration Restriction Bill 1901 was introduced, defined as A Bill for an Act to place certain restrictions on Immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of Prohibited Immigrants. The wording of the bill also listed in its definitions that restrictions \\"means any person who is unable to write out 50 words in a European language dictated by an officer\\". Paterson spoke in favour of the bill, and in particular of the 'Chinese problem'. The bill was subsequently passed, and set in motion what is popularly known as the White Australia policy, which survived until late in the 20th century. Paterson did not contest the subsequent election for health reasons, and retired from politics. He died at his home in Melbourne on 23 March 1908, after years of ill health.

It was first published in German in 1932 as Die Morgenlandfahrt. This novel came directly after his biggest international success, Narcissus and Goldmund. ==Plot summary== Journey to the East is written from the point of view of a man (called \\"H. H.\\" in the book) who becomes a member of \\"The League\\", a timeless religious sect whose members include famous fictional and real characters, such as Plato, Mozart, Pythagoras, Paul Klee, Don Quixote, Puss in Boots, Tristram Shandy, Baudelaire, Goldmund (from Hesse's Narcissus and Goldmund), the artist Klingsor (from Hesse's Klingsor's Last Summer), and the ferryman Vasudeva (from Hesse's Siddhartha). A branch of the group goes on a pilgrimage to \\"the East\\" in search of the \\"ultimate Truth\\". The narrator speaks of traveling through both time and space, across geography imaginary and real. Although at first fun and enlightening, the Journey runs into a crisis in a deep mountain gorge called Morbio Inferiore when Leo, apparently a simple servant, disappears, causing the group to plummet into anxiety and argument. Leo is described as happy, pleasant, handsome, beloved by everyone, having a rapport with animals ‚Äì to a discerning reader, he seems a great deal more than a simple servant, but nobody in the pilgrimage, including the narrator, seems to realise this. Nor does anyone seem to wonder why the group dissolves in dissension and bickering after Leo disappears. Instead they accuse Leo of taking with him various objects which they seem to be missing (and which turn up later) and which they regard as very important (and which later turn out not to be very important), and they blame him for the eventual disintegration of the group and failure of the Journey. Years later, the narrator tries to write his story of the Journey, even though he has lost contact with the group and believes the League no longer exists. But he is unable to put together any coherent account of it; his whole life has sunk into despair and disillusionment since the failure of the one thing which was most important to him, and he has even sold the violin with which he once offered music to the group during the Journey. Finally, at the advice of a friend, he finds the servant Leo and, having failed in his attempt to re- establish communication with him or even be recognized by him when he meets him on a park bench, writes him a long, impassioned letter of \\"grievances, remorse and entreaty\\" and posts it to him that night. The next morning, Leo appears in the narrator's home and tells him he has to appear before the High Throne to be judged by the officials of the League. It turns out (to the narrator's surprise) that Leo, the simple servant, is actually President of the League, and at points seems like Pablo, from Hesse's Steppenwolf. The crisis in Morbio Inferiore was a test of faith which the narrator and everyone else flunked rather dismally. H. H. discovers that his \\"aberration\\" and time spent adrift was part of his trial, and is allowed to return to the League if he can pass any new test of faith and obedience. What he chooses, and the final d√©nouement, is a stroke of Hesse's typical Eastern mysticism at its finest.

In 1975, Allen released his debut, art-country album, Juarez, which is considered \\"one of the greatest concept albums of all time\\" according to PopMatters while Rolling Stone called it an \\"outlaw classic\\". The 1979 follow up, was the groundbreaking, Lubbock (on everything). His deeply moving and satirical lyrics capture his complex memory of growing up in his hometown of Lubbock, Texas. According to AllMusic, Lubbock (On Everything) is \\"one of the finest country albums of all time\\" and a progenitor of the alt-country movement. His song \\"New Delhi Freight Train\\", from Lubbock (On Everything), was first recorded by Little Feat in 1977 on their album, Time Loves a Hero. Guy Clark says, \\"It's such an interesting piece of work... It's the juxtaposition of the song.\\" In 1980, Allen released, Smokin' the Dummy, which he recorded with the Panhandle Mystery Band. His 1983 album, Bloodlines, includes one of his most well-known songs, \\"Gimme a Ride to Heaven Boy\\", which [includes] themes of hitchhiking and the road. In 1986, he collaborated with David Byrne on the soundtrack for Byrne's movie True Stories. Over the span of a decade (1985-1995), Allen released several avant-garde albums, Pedal Steal, Amerasia and Chippy (a collaboration with Joe Ely, Butch Hancock, Robert Earl Keen, Wayne Hancock), which crossover to visual, theatrical and musical medium interpretations. In 1996, he released the country album, Human Remains, which features guest spots from David Byrne, Joe Ely, Charlie and Will Sexton and Lucinda Williams. In 2007, Allen did a guest spot on the track \\"Ghost of Travelin' Jones\\" on Ryan Bingham's album, Mescalito. Allen's 2013 album, Bottom of the World, features his Guy Clark co-write, \\"Queenie's Song\\", inspired by the death of his dog. ==Discography== * Juarez (1975) * Lubbock (On Everything) (1979) * Smokin' the Dummy (1980) * Bloodlines (1983) * Pedal Steal (1985) * Amerasia (1987) * Silent Majority (Terry Allen's Greatest Missed Hits) (1992) * Chippy (1995) * Human Remains (1996) * Salivation (1999) * Live at Al's Grand Hotel.

The state park is known for the abundance of mainly Middle Miocene sub-epoch fossils that can be found on the shoreline. ==Natural history== ===Geology=== The park contains the type locality site of the Early to Middle Miocene Calvert Formation. These rocks are the sediment from a coastal ocean that covered the area during that time. The age of the formation is (19-)18‚Äì15(-14) million years ago (Ma), i.e. it extends essentially over the Hemingfordian stage. This formation occurs in Maryland and neighboring Virginia. In addition, rocks of the younger Choptank and the St. Marys Formations are exposed here. This makes Calvert Cliffs State Park extremely interesting for its paleoclimatology and paleontology, because the accessible strata provide a good record of the Middle Miocene Climate Transition and document a minor mass extinction event ‚Äî the \\"Middle Miocene disruption.\\" Fossil collecting and \\"rockhounding\\" are permitted on the beach; the cliffs are closed due to the dangers of erosion. ===Paleontology=== Fossils from the Calvert Formation, Zone 10, Calvert Co., MD (Miocene) The Calvert Formation is notable for its plentiful fossil shark teeth. Especially popular among \\"rockhounds\\" are those from giants such as Carcharocles and the famous Megalodon (which is often included in Carcharocles). The ancestral baleen whale Eobalaenoptera harrisoni and the merganser Mergus miscellus were described from the Virginian part of the formation. From the uppermost layer, deposited 15‚Äì14 Ma, they represent the oldest known member of their family and genus, respectively. Some remains of a prehistoric loon (Gavia) from the lowermost parts of the Calvert Formation, dating back nearly 18 Ma, are the oldest records of that genus from North America, and among the oldest worldwide. Fossils of the sword fish-like Eurhinodelphis longirostris have been found in zone 14 of the formation. Other notable baleen whales from this area include a Cephalotropis coronatus. One was discovered by hobbyist paleontologist Jeffery DiMeglio in 2004 after cliff erosion caused by Hurricane Isabel exposed the skull and scapula. Mandibles, neck vertebrae, and scapulae were also found during the dig. The skull and vertebrae are on display at the Calvert Marine Museum. Other items found in the field jackets of the whale were fish bones, hundreds of mollusks, a Hexanchus gigas tooth, and two Carcharodon hastalis teeth. ==Social history== On his 1612 map, Captain John Smith identified the area as \\"Rickard's Cliffes,\\" having given them his mother's family's name. Some 350 years later, the state park was developed with the General Assembly funding land purchases in each year from 1965 to 1968, then in 1969, dedicating money to the installation of the park's initial roads, parking area, and utilities. ==Industrial neighbors== The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located a short distance north of the park. The Dominion Cove Point liquid natural gas receiving station is visible off shore from the park beach. ==Activities and amenities== Calvert Cliffs State Park is mostly forested, with some wetland areas and a small pond for fishing. The park has of marked hiking trails. A quarter-mile-long sandy beach is accessible via a trail. Some 550 acres are open to hunting upland game, turkey, and deer. The park is rich in biodiversity and is home to numerous species of plants and animals, with at least 163 species of birds observed in the park. ==References== ==External links== *Calvert Cliffs State Park Maryland Department of Natural Resources *Calvert Cliffs State Park Map Maryland Department of Natural Resources Category:State parks of Maryland Category:Parks in Calvert County, Maryland Category:IUCN Category III Category:Miocene paleontological sites of North America Category:Cenozoic paleontological sites of North America ","title":"Calvert Cliffs State Park"},{"id":"1432526","text":"Sha Na Na is an American rock and roll doo-wop group. Performing a song-and- dance repertoire based on 1950s hit songs, Sha Na Na has been simultaneously reviving and parodying the music of 1950s New York street culture since the group's formation in 1969. After gaining initial fame for their performance at Woodstock, made possible with the help of their friend Jimi Hendrix, the group hosted Sha Na Na, a syndicated variety series that ran from 1977 to 1981. Billing themselves as \\"from the streets of New York\\", members were frequently outfitted in gold lam√© or leather jackets, and sporting pompadour or ducktail hairdos. The group's name is taken from a series of nonsense syllables (\\"Sha Na Na Na Sha Na Na Na Na\\") in the song \\"Get a Job\\", originally recorded by the Silhouettes. The current lineup features original members Donny York and Jocko Marcellino, as well as longtime member Screamin' Scott Simon, who joined in 1970. Everyone else from the original band and TV show has since departed. Current band members include bassist Tim Butler, guitarist Randy Hill, drummer Ty Cox, and sax player Michael Brown. ==Career== The group began singing as part of the long-standing Columbia University a cappella group the Kingsmen, but changed their name due to the Pacific Northwest group of the same name that became famous for recording \\"Louie, Louie\\". Conceived by George Leonard, then a graduate student in humanities, Sha Na Na began performing in 1969 at the height of the hippie counterculture, and achieved national fame after playing at the Woodstock Festival, where Rob Leonard, the president and bass singer of the band, sang the lead on ‚ÄúTeen Angel‚Äù when the band opened for their friend Jimi Hendrix. Their 90-second appearance in the Woodstock film brought the group national attention and helped spark a 1950s nostalgia craze that inspired similar groups (Flash Cadillac, Showaddywaddy, Big Daddy), as well as the Broadway musical Grease (and its feature film adaptation), the feature film American Graffiti and the TV show Happy Days. The group's first manager, Ed Goodgold, codified trivia as a nostalgic quiz game and conducted the nation's first trivia contests with Dan Carlinsky in 1965. The future Sha Na Na/Kingsmen were featured singers at these contests. Four years later, he co-authored \\"Rock 'n' Roll Trivia\\" just as he and the William Morris Agency began steering Sha Na Na's career. From 1969 until 1971, the band played at, among other places, the Fillmore East and Fillmore West, opening for such bands as the Grateful Dead, the Mothers of Invention, and the Kinks.Amalie R. Rothschild, Live at the Fillmore East, 1999 Thunder's Mouth Press When Sha Na Na began headlining at other venues, one of their opening acts was Bruce Springsteen.Marc Dolan, Bruce Springsteen and the Promise of Rock 'N Roll, 2012, W.W. Norton & Co. In 1972, Sha Na Na was one of just four acts invited by John Lennon and Yoko Ono to perform with them at their One-to-One benefit concert at Madison Square Garden. Subsequently, the group appeared in the 1978 movie Grease, and from 1977 to 1982, the group reached perhaps the height of its success with its own hit syndicated television show Sha Na Na, featuring guest musicians such as James Brown, the punk rock band the Ramones, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, the Ronettes, and Chubby Checker. The original band line-up featured 12 performers: Robert A. Leonard (Rob Leonard) (bass vocals), Alan Cooper (bass vocals), Frederick \\"Dennis\\" Greene (Denny) (vocals), Henry Gross (guitar), Jocko Marcellino (drums), Joe Witkin (piano), Scott Powell (also known as Captain Outrageous and Tony Santini) (vocals), Donald \\"Donny\\" York (vocals), Elliot \\"Gino\\" Cahn (rhythm guitar), Rich Joffe (vocals), Dave Garrett (vocals) and Bruce \\"Bruno\\" Clarke (electric bass). The initial act had three up-front performers in gold lam√© and the other nine in \\"greaser\\" attire (rolled up T-shirt sleeves, leather jackets, tank tops). On their album The Golden Age of Rock and Roll, the lead singer taunts the audience on one of the live tracks by announcing, \\"We've got just one thing to say to you fuckin' hippies, and that is that rock and roll is here to stay!\\" The act usually ended after several encores, and closed with \\"Lovers Never Say Goodbye\\". The closing song was changed to \\"Goodnight Sweetheart\\" for the TV series. In concert, they would often return for up to seven encores, and this included when performing in Toronto, at Ontario Place and performing \\"Hound Dog\\" after announcing Elvis Presley's death earlier that same day (August 16, 1977). ==TV series== Sha Na Na hosted the Sha Na Na syndicated variety series that ran from 1977 to 1981. It was among the most watched programs in syndication during its run.The Complete Directory of Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows. 8th Edition ‚Äì 2003, Ballantine Books. The show was produced by Pierre Cossette and originally distributed by LBS Communications. The show featured the group performing hits from the 1950s and 1960s, along with comedy skits. The \\"tough guys\\" road act from their original road shows was adapted for TV and the group moved to a comedy and self-deprecating routine. The mainstay continued to be the 1950s song and dance routines. The show opened in a typical concert scene, and then moved through various street and ice cream parlor scenes where they and their guests performed several songs. That was followed by a comedy-oriented song (\\"Alley Oop\\", \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah\\") and closed with a slow song, again in their concert format. Among the supporting members featured in the series were Avery Schreiber, Kenneth Mars and Philip Roth (all of them in the first season); both Pamela Myers and actress Jane Dulo (the crabby Lady in the Window, who watched over the street scenes from her apartment with undisguised disdain) throughout the show's run, June Gable and Soupy Sales (seasons 2 to 4); Michael Sklar (season 2); and Karen Hartman (season 4). Guests included Jan & Dean, Fabian, Chubby Checker, the Ramones, Ethel Merman, Frank Gorshin, Billy Crystal, Danny and the Juniors, Rita Moreno and others. The members of Sha Na Na during the TV series were Jon \\"Bowzer\\" Bauman (vocals), Lennie Baker (sax/vocals), Johnny Contardo (vocals), Frederick \\"Dennis\\" Greene (vocals), Danny \\"Dirty Dan\\" McBride (guitar/vocals) (left after third season), Jocko Marcellino (drums/vocals), Dave \\"Chico\\" Ryan (bass/vocals), 'Screamin' Scott Simon (piano/vocals), Scott \\"Santini\\" Powell (vocals), Donald \\"Donny\\" York (vocals). Every member was featured with a solo vocal spot during the course of the series. Each was introduced only by his nickname or his first name in a voice-over by Myers at the beginning of each show. ==Film== The group appear as themselves in the documentaries Woodstock (1970) and Festival Express (2003). Sha Na Na also appeared in the 1978 film Grease (an adaptation of the 1971 Broadway musical of the same name) as a 1950s band called Johnny Casino and the Gamblers. Their tracks on the film and Grease soundtrack include two songs from the original 1971 musical: \\"Those Magic Changes\\" and \\"Born to Hand Jive\\"; as well as four songs from the early rock and roll era: versions of Elvis Presley's covers of \\"Hound Dog\\" (1956) and \\"Blue Moon\\" (1956), a cover of the Imperials' \\"Tears on My Pillow\\" (1958), and a cover of Danny & the Juniors' \\"Rock & Roll Is Here to Stay\\" (1958). The song \\"Sandy\\" sung by John Travolta in the film, was co- written specifically for the film by Sha Na Na's Screamin' Scott Simon. ==Members== In alphabetical order ;Current members * Donald York, a.k.a. \\"Donny\\" (1969‚Äìpresent): original vocalist * Gene Jaramillo (2006‚Äìpresent): guitarist; replaced Buzz Campbell * John Marcellino, a.k.a. \\"Jocko\\" (1969‚Äìpresent): original drummer, vocalist * Michael Brown, a.k.a. \\"Downtown Michael Brown\\" (2005‚Äìpresent): saxophonist and vocalist, replaced Frankie Adell * Randy Hill, a.k.a. \\"Rockin' Randy\\" (2008‚Äìpresent): lead guitarist * \\"Screamin'\\" Scott Simon (1970‚Äìpresent): pianist, vocalist; replaced Joe Witkin * Tim Butler (2006, 2009, 2011‚Äìpresent): bass guitarist * Ty Cox (2013‚Äìpresent): drummer ;Former members: * Alan Cooper (1969‚Äì1970, 1971): original bass singer; brief return in 1971 due to Bowzer's illness * Billy Schwartz (1971): guitarist on Canadian tour in 1971 due to Chris Donald's inability to enter Canada * Bruce C.

The Moral Code was adopted at the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1961, as part of the new Party Programme. The very first moral principle was \\"Devotion to the cause of communism\\". Its twelve rules may be superficially compared to the Ten Commandments, but they overlap only marginally (although in Russian-speaking books and media one may sometimes see the claims about foundations in the Bible, referring to, e.g., \\"he who does not work, neither shall he eat\\" (2 Thessalonians 3:10); also used in the 1936 Soviet Constitution). Unlike the Ten Commandments, however, the rules of the Code were not concrete rules of conduct; they were stated as the rules of attitude. For example, \\"You shall not commit adultery\\" of Moses loosely corresponds to \\"Mutual respect in a family, concern about the upbringing of children\\" of the Code. Another notable distinction is that the Moral Code speaks in terms of the relation of a person to the society, rather than in terms of personal virtues. For example, the \\"Do not steal\\" may be loosely matched to \\"Concern of everyone about the preservation and multiplication of the common wealth\\". Russian legislator and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov compared the moral code of the builder of communism to the Sermon on the Mount. == Twelve rules of the Builder of Communism == Here are the commandments which were written as a part of the Third Party Programme: # Loyalty to Communism, and love of the socialist Motherland and other socialist countries. # Conscious work for the good of the society: One who doesn't work, doesn't get to eat. # Care for the collective property, as well as the multiplying of this property. # High consciousness of the social responsibilities, and intolerance to the violation of the social interests. # Collectivism and comradery: All for one and one for all. # Humane relationships between human beings: One human being is a friend, a comrade and a brother to another human being. # Honesty, ethical cleanliness, as well as simplicity and modesty both in private and public life. # Mutual respect in the family, and care for the upbringing of the children. # Intolerance to the injustice, social parasitism, unfairness, careerism, and acquisitiveness. # Friendship and brotherhood with all the nations of the USSR, intolerance to all racial and national dislike. # Intolerance to the enemies of communism, peace and freedom of peoples of the world. # Brotherly solidarity to all workers of all countries and nations. ==See also== * Prussian virtues * Eight Honors and Eight Shames ==References== Category:Documents of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Category:Soviet culture Category:Codes of conduct Category:1961 documents ","title":"Moral Code of the Builder of Communism"},{"id":"1432541","text":"Charophyta is a group of freshwater green algae, sometimes treated as a division, but also as a superdivision, or an unranked clade. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta most likely emerged within Charophyta, possibly from terrestrial unicellular charophytes, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. The clade Streptophyta is formed by the grouping together of the Embryophyta and the Charophyta. The sister group of the Charophytes are the Chlorophyta. In some charophyte groups, such as the Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagella are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in stoneworts (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil stoneworts of early Devonian age that are similar to those of the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland.Somewhat different charophytes have also been collected from the Late Devonian (Famennian) Waterloo Farm lagerst√§tte of South Africa. These include two species each of Octochara and Hexachara, which are the oldest fossils of Charophyte axes bearing in situ oogonia. ==Classification== Charophyta are complex green algae that form a sister group to the Chlorophyta and within which the Embryophyta emerged. The chlorophyte and charophyte green algae and the embryophytes or land plants form a clade called the green plants or Viridiplantae, that is united among other things by the absence of phycobilins, the presence of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, cellulose in the cell wall and the use of starch, stored in the plastids, as a storage polysaccharide. The charophytes and embryophytes share several traits that distinguish them from the chlorophytes, such as the presence of certain enzymes (class I aldolase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, glycolate oxidase, flagellar peroxidase), lateral flagella (when present), and, in many species, the use of phragmoplasts in mitosis. Thus Charophyta and Embryophyta together form the clade Streptophyta, excluding the Chlorophyta. Charophytes such as Palaeonitella cranii and possibly the yet unassigned Parka decipiens are present in the fossil record of the Devonian. Palaeonitella differed little from some present-day stoneworts. === Cladogram === Below is a consensus reconstruction of green algal relationships, mainly based on molecular data. The phylogeny is not entirely uncontroversial. The placement of the basal green algae (Mesostigmatophyceae, Spirotaenia, and Chlorokybophyceae) is more conventionally at the base of Streptophytes. Basal Streptophytes are filamentous, while Mesostigmatophyceae and Chlorokybophyceae are not. ==Description== The Zygnematophyceae or, as they used to be called, Conjugatophyceae, generally possess two fairly elaborate chloroplasts in each cell, rather than many discoid ones. They reproduce asexually by the development of a septum between the two cell-halves or semi-cells (in unicellular forms, each daughter-cell develops the other semi-cell afresh) and sexually by conjugation, or the fusion of the entire cell-contents of the two conjugating cells. The saccoderm desmids and the placoderm or true desmids, unicellular or filamentous members of the Zygnematophyceae, are dominant in non-calcareous, acid waters of oligotrophic or primitive lakes (e.g. Wastwater), or in lochans, tarns and bogs, as in the West of Scotland, Eire, parts of Wales and of the Lake District. Klebsormidium, the type of the Klebsormidiophyceae, is a simple filamentous form with circular, plate-like chloroplasts, reproducing by fragmentation, by dorsiventral, biciliate swarmers and, according to Wille, a twentieth-century algologist, by aplanospores. Sexual reproduction is simple and isogamous (the male and female gametes are outwardly indistinguishable). The various groups included in the Charophyta have diverse and idiosyncratic reproductive systems, sometimes with complex reproductive organs. The unique habit among the algae of protecting the overwintering zygote within the tissues of the parent gametophyte is one of several characteristics of Coleochaetales that suggest that they are a sister group to the embryophytes. The Charales or stoneworts are freshwater algae with slender green or grey stems; the grey colour of many species results from the deposition of lime on the walls, masking the green colour of the chlorophyll. The main stems are slender and branch occasionally. Lateral branchlets occur in whorls at regular intervals up the stem, they are attached by rhizoids to the substrate.Bryant 2007, J. The Stoneworts (Chlorophyta, Charales) in Guiry, M.D., John, D.M., Rindi, F. and McCarthy, T.K (Ed) New Survey of Clare Island Volume 6: The Freshwater and Terrestrial Algae. Royal Irish Academy. The reproductive organs consist of antheridia and oogonia, though the structures of these organs differ considerably from the corresponding organs in other algae. As a result of fertilization a protonema is formed, from which the sexually reproducing algae develops. Charophytes are frequently found in hard water with dissolved calcium or magnesium carbonates. They tolerate low concentrations of salt, and are found in the inner reaches of the Baltic Sea and in tropical brackish lagoons but not in marine environments. The water must be still, or only slow-flowing, oligotrophic or mesotrophic and little pollution due to sewage. The Charophyceae are obligate aquatic algae, growing submerged in calcareous fresh water. They are distributed throughout the world from the tropics to cold temperate zones. Six genera are recognized: *Chara *Lamprothamnium *Lychnothamnus *Nitella *Nitellopsis *Tolypella. ===Cell structure=== There are numerous small discoid chloroplasts, which are disposed around the periphery of the cells. No pyrenoids are present. The large internodal cells are sometimes multinucleate, and their nuclei often possess large nucleoli and little chromatin. In these cells the cytoplasm forms only a peripheral layer with a large central vacuole. The cell walls are composed of cellulose, though there may be also a superficial layer of a more gelatinous material of unknown composition. The storage material is starch, except in the oospore, where oil also occurs. This starch also accumulates in special storage structures, termed bulbils, which consist of rounded cells of varying size which are developed in clusters on the lower stem and root nodes. They are mainly developed when the algae are growing in fine slimy mud. Cytoplasmic streaming was first demonstrated in the giant cells of Chara internodes by Giovanni Battista Amici, in 1818. ===Sexual reproduction=== Light micrograph of a whole-mount slide of an alt=Light micrograph of a whole-mount slide of an oogonium and antheridium of Chara The reproductive organs of the Charales show a high degree of specialization. The female organ, called an oogonium is a large oval structure with an envelope of spirally arranged, bright green filaments of cells. It is termed an oogonium. The male organ or is also large, bright yellow or red in colour, spherical in shape, and is usually termed an antheridium, though some workers regard it as a multiple structure rather than a single organ. The sex organs are developed in pairs from the adaxial nodal cell at the upper nodes of the primary lateral branches, the oogonium being formed above the antheridium. They are sufficiently large to be easily seen with the naked eye, especially the bright orange or red antheridium. Many species are dioecious. In others the monoecious condition is complicated by the development of the antheridium before the formation of the oogonium, thus preventing fertilization by antherozoids of the same alga. In this case the two types of sex organs usually arise from different points on the lateral branches. All cells of the Charales are haploid except for the fertilized zygote, the large single cell in the interior of the oogonium, which becomes enclosed in a thickened hard wall to form an oospore that awaits favorable conditions for germination. Upon germination the diploid oospore undergoes meiosis, producing four haploid nuclei. A septum divides a small apical cell with one haploid nucleus from a large basal cell containing the other three nuclei, which will slowly degenerate. The oospore apical cell divides to produce the protonemal initial, from which the primary protonema arises, and the rhizoidal initial, from which the primary rhizoid descends. From these the alga continues its development. ===Vegetative propagation=== Vegetative propagation occurs readily in the Charales. Secondary protonemata may develop even more rapidly than primary ones. Fragments of nodes, dormant cells of algae after hibernation or the basal nodes of primary rhizoids may all produce these secondary protonemata, from which fresh sexual algae can arise. It is probably this power of vegetative propagation which explains the fact that species of Characeae are generally found forming dense clonal mats in the beds of ponds or streams, covering quite large areas. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Plant divisions ","title":"Charophyta"},{"id":"1432553","text":"Jozef Marianus \\"Jos\\" Punt (born 10 January 1946) was the Roman Catholic bishop of Haarlem-Amsterdam in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2020. ==Early life== Joseph Marianus Punt was born on 10 January 1946 in Alkmaar, North Holland, Netherlands. In his years as a student of economics in Amsterdam Punt distanced himself from the Catholic religion of his youth and was more involved in esoterics, gnostics, Rosicrucianism, and so on. Upon discovering the Bible however, he began considering a career in the priesthood. He went to the south of the country where at the time there existed the only Catholic Dutch Seminary. In 1973 he obtained a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Amsterdam. ==Roman Catholic Church== In 1979 he became a priest, ordained by Bishop of Roermond Joannes Gijsen. In the Seminary he taught the Social Teachings of the Church, and he got also his PhD in that field from Augsburg University in Germany. Pope John Paul II appointed him Auxiliary Bishop of Haarlem 1995; he was ordained by the local ordinary, bishop Henny Bomers. Punt was also appointed as apostolic administrator for the Military Ordinariate. In 1998 Bomers died suddenly after suffering a heart attack. Punt was appointed Apostolic Administrator. On 21 July 2001 he was appointed bishop of Haarlem. Bisdominformatie, Diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam. Retrieved on 7 January 2012. He was assisted by auxiliary bishop Johannes Gerardus Maria Hendriks, who was appointed coadjutor bishop in December 2018 and succeeded him as bishop of Haarlem-Amsterdam in 1 June 2020. Punt was the 13th bishop of the diocese, which was established in 1559. Due to the Protestant Reformation there was no bishop in Haarlem, or the Netherlands, for 300 years, until 1853. Pope Francis accepted his resignation on 1 June 2020. He had previously announced he hoped to retire before the usual age of 75 for health reasons. ==Religious views== Bishop Punt has indicated a devotion to Saint Mary because he took as his motto Sub tuum praesidium, the opening phrase of a Marian hymn. He supports a proposal of the Lourdes Foundation of Amstel to construct a pilgrimage church modeled on Hagia Sophia to be built in honor of Maria Vrouwe van Alle Volkeren.\\"Bishop Jos Punt wants a monumental pilgrimage church in Amsterdam\\", Kirknet.

Some football events have their own anthems, which are not played during breaks, but rather as entrance music. The most notable anthems are the FIFA Anthem and the UEFA Champions League Anthem. Stadium anthems are characterized by a catchy uptempo rhythm and a repeated vocal call-response catchphrase, often a statement of pride or arrogance (such as \\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We Are the Champions\\" and \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" by Queen).We Are the Champions Allmusic.

The medical center is a part of the SSM Health System and is affiliated with the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. SLUH features an ACS designated adult Level 1 Trauma Center and has a helipad to handle medevac patients. From 1998 to 2015, this hospital was owned by the for-profit Tenet Healthcare Corporation.

Continuous growth and the need for modern facilities and equipment resulted in the construction of a new hospital facility as an addition to the original structure. This new part of the hospital was built directly behind the old Firmin Desloge Hospital at a cost of $39.1 million. The first patients moved in on January 30, 1988. In 1998, the hospital was purchased from Saint Louis University by the Tenet Health System. In 2015, the hospital was bought back by the university and then transferred to SSM Health. As of October 2015, SSM Health was planning to spend $500 million to rebuild and expand the hospital. Various media reported that the options under consideration include demolishing the 1933 hospital tower; SSM officials say they have not ruled that out.

The band initially found a following in the Hollywood garage rock scene, and later adopted a contemporary look and hard rock sound. The band leader and singer/songwriter, Paula Pierce, died on August 10, 1991, of an aneurysm at the age of 31. == Formation == The Pandoras began in late 1982 as part of the 1960s revival garage rock scene led by The Unclaimed, which was led by Pierce's boyfriend, Shelley Ganz. They were also associated with the Paisley Underground era in Hollywood's alternative rock scene that shared an aesthetic heavily influenced by 1960s garage rock and psychedelia. Most members came from the west side and beach cities area of Los Angeles County and Orange County. Pierce, a resident of Chino, California, had been a member of the Hollywood music scene and playing in bands since 1976. The Pandoras were formed when singer/guitarist Pierce, a member of the mod/garage/pop Action Now, met singer/guitarist/bass player Deborah Mendoza (aka Mende/Menday), at Southern California's Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga in 1982. Mendoza, an art major, answered an ad that Pierce, a graphic arts major, had posted on the bulletin board in the cafeteria. The ad read, \\"Wanted, another female musician to jam with! Influenced by sixties garage punk.\\" They began bringing their guitars to school and jamming between classes. Pierce brought in a long-time friend, musician Gwynne Kelly (real name Gwynne Kahn) as a keyboardist, second guitarist and backing vocalist. Mendoza brought in drummer Casey Gomez. After a band meeting in December 1982, Kelly christened the band The Pandoras, though names such as The Keyholes, Hole, The wHolesome, and The Goodwylls were considered. == Early career and controversy == After recording their first EP in 1983, I'm Here I'm Gone on Moxie Records, Mendoza left the group. She was replaced by on bass by Bambi Conway. Conway appeared on The Pandoras' debut album, It's About Time, on Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 449 In 1984, The Pandoras split into two factions just as the It's About Time LP was released. Conway, unhappy with Pierce's behavior and band decisions, quit The Pandoras. That was followed by Pierce firing Kelly, and shortly thereafter, Gomez split with Pierce. Pierce decided to continue as The Pandoras and recruit three new members. Before Pierce could form a band, Conway and Kelly played a show as The Pandoras, with other temporary fill-in musicians (notably Michael Quercio of The Three O'Clock on lead vocals/guitar). Gomez joined Conway and Kelly to form an alternative Pandoras to the band Pierce was assembling. The resulting dispute over the Pandoras name was discussed on a KROQ-FM radio show hosted by Rodney Bingenheimer and in the local music zines such as BAM, Music Connection, and the LA Weekly (and its \\"L.A.Dee Da\\" gossip column). The Kelly-led Pandoras‚Äînicknamed The Gwynnedoras‚Äîconsisted of Kelly, Gomez, Conway, plus Lisa Rae Black. Pierce's new version of The Pandoras included Melanie Vammen on keyboards, Julie Patchouli on bass, and Karen Blankfeld on drums. They went on to enjoy modest success with the release of the Hot Generation single on Bomp! Records in late 1984‚Äîthe first of the two \\"Pandoras\\" bands to release a record. The Pierce-led band toured the east coast with the Fuzztones to promote the single. The Kelly-led Pandoras released \\"Worm Boy\\" on an Enigma Records compilation, Enigma Variations, in 1985. When readying for an EP on Enigma Records, the label insisted that the Kelly-led Pandoras change their name. This ended the controversy and the Pierce-led Pandoras prevailed. The Kelly-led band's EP, to be titled Psycho Circus, was never released, and a band name never settled upon. Patchouli quit The Pandoras in the spring of 1985, citing the band's change in direction away from garage music. Answering an ad in The Recycler newspaper, Gayle Morency joined The Pandoras and played bass for two shows before retiring from music to raise a family. Morency was replaced by bassist Kim Shattuck in July 1985. == Rhino era == The Pandoras were signed to Rhino Records and began recording the basic tracks for the Stop Pretending album during the winter of 1985 with producer Bill Inglot, who had produced earlier Pandoras and Action Now releases. In 1986, Stop Pretending was released. The Pandoras was labeled \\"one of the bands that matter\\" by the LA Weekly. The band continued to play live and record new songs for their major label debut and were a top live club draw outside of Los Angeles, touring with Nina Hagen, and performing on bills with such acts as Iggy Pop, The Fuzztones, The Beat Farmers, Johnny Thunders, and The Cramps. The Pandoras played the inaugural LA Weekly Music Awards and showcased a slightly harder sound and were interviewed on the roof of the Variety Arts Center for a top French TV Show. == Elektra era == Elektra A&R; man (and boyfriend of Pierce) Steve Pross signed the band to Elektra Records. The band made numerous attempts to record the album, to be titled Come Inside. During this period, Blankfeld was forced from the band due to disagreements about band management, and was replaced with Kelly Dillard. Blankfeld went on to play bass with former Enigma recording artists Wednesday Week, before forming the Billboard-charting all-female band The Rebel Pebbles. Dillard was in The Pandoras for only two months, and during that time did photoshoots intended for the cover of Come Inside and recorded \\"Run Down Love Battery\\" for the album. She was replaced on drums by Sheri Kaplan, and Susan Hyatt was added on guitar in December 1987. Kaplan and Hyatt had previously played together in the Los Angeles all-female band, Feline. After a month, Hyatt left The Pandoras due to a change in the band's musical direction and clothing style. Before the release of the LP, which had reached the test- pressing stage, Pross was fired by Elektra. As a result, the label dropped both bands he had signed ‚Äî Jetboy and The Pandoras ‚Äî with their respective records being withdrawn from release. Many of the demo recordings The Pandoras made during the Elektra era eventually surfaced on the Psychedelic Sluts bootleg CD. == Restless era == The band continued to play live while looking for another record deal. Rita D'Albert joined as a guitarist. The Pandoras recorded new songs and released the Rock Hard mini-LP on Restless Records. A video for \\"Run Down Love Battery\\" received airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball, expanding their audience to include metal fans. D'Albert left The Pandoras in February 1989, just before a tour in support of Rock Hard, to join Human Drama, which had signed to RCA records. Rather than cancel the tour, the band went out as a four-piece. A show in Dallas, Texas at Z Rock was recorded for a \\"Coast to Coast Concert Series\\" broadcast. They also made an appearance on the first episode of The Arsenio Hall Show where they performed \\"Run Down Love Battery\\". Billie Jo Hash joined the band on guitar for the second leg of the Rock Hard tour, although she only lasted through the summer of 1989. Lissa Beltri joined The Pandoras in late 1989. Rather than record a new studio album with the new line-up, Pierce opted to let Restless Records release the Z-Rock concert as a live mini-album. Live Nymphomania was released and, even though Pierce was not happy with the recording, the band toured in support of it. == Disbandment and Pierce's death == In July 1990, keyboardist Vammen was removed from The Pandoras by Pierce, over Shattuck's and Kaplan's objections. Pierce's reason for Vammen's departure was that the new direction of the band did not require keyboards. An Australian tour and a European tour were cancelled; prompting Shattuck to leave the band in late 1990. There was a single show with a fill-in male bassist, and then Kaplan quit the band to join Hardly Dangerous, ending The Pandoras. In the wake of Shattuck's departure, Vammen and Shattuck formed The Muffs. In 1991, Pierce slowly worked on new material with Beltri. A drummer joined Pierce and Beltri, who began auditioning bass players. On August 9, a bass player auditioned who both Pierce and Beltri liked. She was to be brought back in for a rehearsal on August 11. However, on August 10, after dinner and an exercise session, Pierce suffered a fatal aneurysm in the shower. Pierce had complained of painful headaches for two weeks before her death, but did not seek medical care. Former Pandoras' roadie Dave Eddy, former band members, and friends organized a tribute and fundraising show at the Coconut Teaser. The show saw performances by Cherie Currie of The Runaways and her twin sister Marie Currie in their first public performance together in 20 years, with the final line up of the Pandoras backing them, as well as Precious Metal, who had broken up but who reunited for the show, Redd Kross and Abby Travis, Dramarama with Clem Burke of Blondie and Sylvain Sylvain from the New York Dolls, The Muffs (Shattuck's and Vammen's band), African Violet (D'Albert band), Hardly Dangerous (Kaplan's band) and White Flag. == Reunions == Five Pandoras‚ÄîHyatt (lead vocals, guitar), Black (lead guitar), Vammen (keyboards), Blankfeld (bass), and Kaplan (drums)--united to play three Pierce-penned Pandoras songs (\\"You Don't Satisfy\\", \\"In and Out of my Life In A Day\\" and \\"You're All Talk\\") at a private party in Redondo Beach, CA in October 2013. In 2014, The 21st Century Pandoras‚ÄîHyatt (lead vocals, guitar), Black (lead guitar), Kelly (bass, aka Nipper Seaturtle), Conway (keyboards) and Gomez (drums)‚Äîwas formed. Two digital singles of new material‚Äî\\"Joyride\\" and \\"Flashback Forever\\"‚Äîhave been released under The 21st Century Pandoras name. On July 4, 2015, there was a reunion show billed as The Pandoras at the 2015 Burger Boogaloo (hosted by Burger Records and filmmaker John Waters at Mosswood Park, in Oakland, CA, which featured Shattuck (lead vocals, guitar), Vammen (keyboard), Blankfeld (bass), and Kaplan (drums). ==Members== ===Timeline=== == Discography == === Albums and mini-albums === *It's About Time (1984 - Voxx Records) *Stop Pretending (1986 - Rhino Records) *Rock Hard (1988 - mini-album - Restless Records) *Live Nymphomania (1989 - Restless Records) *Hey It's The Pandoras (2018 - Burger Records) === Singles and EPs === *I'm Here I'm Gone (1983 - EP - Moxie Records) *Hot Generation/You Don't Satisfy (1984 - Single - Voxx Records) *In And Out of My Life (In a Day)/The Hump (1985 - Single - Rhino Records) *I Didn't Cry/Thunder Alley (1999 - Dionysus) ===The 21st Century Pandoras Singles=== *\\"Joyride\\" (2014 - Oh Long Johnson Records) *\\"Flashback Forever\\" (2014 - Oh Long Johnson Records) === Compilation appearances === *Enigma Variations (1985 - Enigma) *What Surf II (1985 - what records) *Battle of the Garages, Vol. 2 (1993 - Voxx Records) *Tales From The Rhino (1994 - Rhino Records) *Destination Bomp (1994 - Voxx Records) *The Roots of Power Pop (1996 - Voxx Records) *Be A Caveman: The Best Of The Voxx Garage Revival (2000 - Voxx Records) === Reissues === *Rock Hard/Live Nymphomania (2005 - Reissue - Restless) *Stop Pretending (2006 - Rhino Handmade - remastered re-release with additional tracks) === Videos/DVD === *Slipping Through the Cracks (An Uprising of Young Pacifics) (video); IceWorld Video === Unreleased album === *Come Inside (1987 - Elektra Records) === Bootlegs === *Psychedelic Sluts (1994 - Erekta) == References == Category:All- female bands Category:Garage punk groups Category:Indie rock musical groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 1983 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1990 Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Restless Records artists Category:Elektra Records artists ","title":"The Pandoras"},{"id":"1432589","text":"In mathematics, the Schwarz lemma, named after Hermann Amandus Schwarz, is a result in complex analysis about holomorphic functions from the open unit disk to itself. The lemma is less celebrated than stronger theorems, such as the Riemann mapping theorem, which it helps to prove. It is, however, one of the simplest results capturing the rigidity of holomorphic functions. ==Statement== > Schwarz Lemma. Let \\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\\\\\{z : z < 1\\\\\\\\} be the open unit disk in > the complex plane \\\\mathbb{C} centered at the origin and let f : > \\\\mathbf{D}\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} be a holomorphic map such that f(0) = 0 and > f(z)\\\\leq 1 on \\\\mathbf{D}. Then, f(z) \\\\leq z \\\\ \\\\forall z \\\\in \\\\mathbf{D} > and f'(0) \\\\leq 1. Moreover, if f(z) = z for some non-zero z or f'(0) > = 1, then f(z) = az for some a \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} with a = 1.Theorem 5.34 in ==Proof== The proof is a straightforward application of the maximum modulus principle on the function :g(z) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z}\\\\, & \\\\mbox{if } z eq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ f'(0) & \\\\mbox{if } z = 0, \\\\end{cases} which is holomorphic on the whole of D, including at the origin (because f is differentiable at the origin and fixes zero). Now if Dr = {z : z ‚â§ r} denotes the closed disk of radius r centered at the origin, then the maximum modulus principle implies that, for r < 1, given any z in Dr, there exists zr on the boundary of Dr such that : g(z) \\\\le g(z_r) = \\\\frac{f(z_r)}{z_r} \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{r}. As r \\\\rightarrow 1 we get g(z) \\\\leq 1. Moreover, suppose that f(z) = z for some non-zero z in D, or f‚Ä≤(0) = 1. Then, g(z) = 1 at some point of D. So by the maximum modulus principle, g(z) is equal to a constant a such that a = 1. Therefore, f(z) = az, as desired. ==Schwarz-Pick theorem== A variant of the Schwarz lemma, known as the Schwarz-Pick theorem (after Georg Pick), characterizes the analytic automorphisms of the unit disc, i.e. bijective holomorphic mappings of the unit disc to itself: Let f : D ‚Üí D be holomorphic. Then, for all z1, z2 ‚àà D, :\\\\left\\\\frac{f(z_1)-f(z_2)}{1-\\\\overline{f(z_1)}f(z_2)}\\\\right \\\\le \\\\left\\\\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-\\\\overline{z_1}z_2}\\\\right and, for all z ‚àà D, :\\\\frac{\\\\leftf'(z)\\\\right}{1-\\\\leftf(z)\\\\right^2} \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\leftz\\\\right^2}. The expression : d(z_1,z_2)=\\\\tanh^{-1} \\\\left\\\\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-\\\\overline{z_1}z_2}\\\\right is the distance of the points z1, z2 in the Poincar√© metric, i.e. the metric in the Poincar√© disc model for hyperbolic geometry in dimension two. The Schwarz-Pick theorem then essentially states that a holomorphic map of the unit disk into itself decreases the distance of points in the Poincar√© metric. If equality holds throughout in one of the two inequalities above (which is equivalent to saying that the holomorphic map preserves the distance in the Poincar√© metric), then f must be an analytic automorphism of the unit disc, given by a M√∂bius transformation mapping the unit disc to itself. An analogous statement on the upper half-plane H can be made as follows: > Let f : H ‚Üí H be holomorphic. Then, for all z1, z2 ‚àà H, > :\\\\left\\\\frac{f(z_1)-f(z_2)}{\\\\overline{f(z_1)}-f(z_2)}\\\\right\\\\le > \\\\frac{\\\\leftz_1-z_2\\\\right}{\\\\left\\\\overline{z_1}-z_2\\\\right}. This is an easy consequence of the Schwarz-Pick theorem mentioned above: One just needs to remember that the Cayley transform W(z) = (z ‚àí i)/(z + i) maps the upper half-plane H conformally onto the unit disc D. Then, the map W o f o W‚àí1 is a holomorphic map from D onto D. Using the Schwarz-Pick theorem on this map, and finally simplifying the results by using the formula for W, we get the desired result. Also, for all z ‚àà H, :\\\\frac{\\\\leftf'(z)\\\\right}{\\\\text{Im}(f(z))} \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{Im}(z)}. If equality holds for either the one or the other expressions, then f must be a M√∂bius transformation with real coefficients. That is, if equality holds, then :f(z)=\\\\frac{az+b}{cz+d} with a, b, c, d ‚àà R, and ad ‚àí bc > 0\\\\. ==Proof of Schwarz-Pick theorem== The proof of the Schwarz-Pick theorem follows from Schwarz's lemma and the fact that a M√∂bius transformation of the form :\\\\frac{z-z_0}{\\\\overline{z_0}z-1}, \\\\qquad z_0 < 1, maps the unit circle to itself. Fix z1 and define the M√∂bius transformations : M(z)=\\\\frac{z_1-z}{1-\\\\overline{z_1}z}, \\\\qquad \\\\varphi(z)=\\\\frac{f(z_1)-z}{1-\\\\overline{f(z_1)}z}. Since M(z1) = 0 and the M√∂bius transformation is invertible, the composition œÜ(f(M‚àí1(z))) maps 0 to 0 and the unit disk is mapped into itself. Thus we can apply Schwarz's lemma, which is to say :\\\\left \\\\varphi\\\\left(f(M^{-1}(z))\\\\right) \\\\right=\\\\left\\\\frac{f(z_1)-f(M^{-1}(z))}{1-\\\\overline{f(z_1)}f(M^{-1}(z))}\\\\right \\\\le z. Now calling z2 = M‚àí1(z) (which will still be in the unit disk) yields the desired conclusion :\\\\left\\\\frac{f(z_1)-f(z_2)}{1-\\\\overline{f(z_1)}f(z_2)}\\\\right \\\\le \\\\left\\\\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-\\\\overline{z_1}z_2}\\\\right. To prove the second part of the theorem, we rearrange the left-hand side into the difference quotient and let z2 tend to z1. ==Further generalizations and related results== The Schwarz‚ÄìAhlfors‚ÄìPick theorem provides an analogous theorem for hyperbolic manifolds. De Branges' theorem, formerly known as the Bieberbach Conjecture, is an important extension of the lemma, giving restrictions on the higher derivatives of f at 0 in case f is injective; that is, univalent. The Koebe 1/4 theorem provides a related estimate in the case that f is univalent. ==References== * Jurgen Jost, Compact Riemann Surfaces (2002), Springer- Verlag, New York.

Previously he served as the parliament speaker, foreign minister, president of the United Nations General Assembly, and a journalist. ==Early life== Malik was born in Pematang Siantar, now of North Sumatra in the then-Dutch East Indies to Abdul Malik Batubara and Salamah Lubis. He was from a Batak Mandailing Muslim family of the Batubara clan. After completing Junior High School, he received his first job as a shopkeeper, filling in time by reading books and increasing his knowledge.Profile at TokohIndonesia.com Malik quickly developed an interest in politics and aged just 17, became the Chairman of the Pematang Siantar branch of Partindo (Indonesia Party). In this position, Malik campaigned for the Dutch Colonial Government to grant independence to Indonesia. As a result of this, Malik was put in prison for disobeying the Colonial Government's ban on political assemblies. Once he was freed, Malik left Pematang Siantar for Jakarta. ==Career== After leaving hometown, Malik pursued a job as a journalist. He wrote for Partindo's Party Magazine and Pelita Andalas Newspaper. In 1937, along with like-minded colleagues, Malik formed ANTARA.ADAM MALIK (INDONESIA). United Nations ANTARA would develop to become Indonesia's national news agency. Malik played an important role in the events leading up to Indonesia's Declaration of Independence. On 16 August 1945 Malik and other pro-Independence youths kidnapped Nationalist movement leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta. They took the two leaders to the town of Rengasdengklok and forced them to declare Indonesia's Independence to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese Occupational Forces which had surrendered. Sukarno and Hatta finally declared Indonesia's Independence, on 17 August 1945. The two were also elected as Indonesia's first President and Vice-President. After Indonesia's independence, Malik formed the Murba Party and used it as a platform to become a Parliament member. Malik also served as the Third Deputy Chairman of the Indonesian Central National Committee (KNIP). After becoming a journalist and a politician, Malik then took up the duties of a diplomat. In 1959, he was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union and Poland. This was followed in 1962 by an appointment as Chairman of the Indonesian Delegation for the negotiations to hand over West Irian to Indonesia. He then served as Minister for Trade before being appointed Minister for the Implementation of the Guided Economy in Sukarno's Cabinet. ==Transition from Old Order to the New Order== With Sukarno being increasingly influenced by the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in his policies, Malik set up the Preservation Institution of Sukarnoism (BPS). This organisation aimed to translate Sukarnoist ideas in a non-Communist sense and to use the name Sukarno to criticise the PKI. Sukarno was not oblivious to this and banned BPS in 1965. Together with General Abdul Haris Nasution and Ruslan Abdulgani, Malik was despised by the PKI for his anti-Communist stance. In 1965, as per archives from CIA, Malik receive 50 million rupiah to execute the ex PKI, quote \\"Ambassador Green's December 2, 1965 endorsement of a 50 million rupiah covert payment to the \\"army-inspired but civilian-staffed action group [Kap- Gestapu]... still carrying burden of current repressive efforts targeted against PKI....\\" The document immediately following, presumably CIA's response to this proposal from 3 December 1965 (written by William Colby of CIA's Far East division to the State Department's William Bundy), was withheld in full from the volume. (pp. 379‚Äì380)\\". In 1966 was the year which saw Sukarno lose his executive powers as he passed them over to Lieutenant General Suharto through a Presidential decree known as Supersemar. Although Sukarno continued to keep the title of President, all the de facto power was in the hand of Suharto. A Cabinet reshuffle followed in which Malik took up the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Malik, together with Suharto and Hamengkubuwono IX formed a triumvirate as they sought to reverse Sukarno's policies. As Foreign Affairs Minister, Malik conducted trips to Western countries to reschedule debt payments. Malik also quit the Murba Party that year to put himself more in line with the new regime's more open economic policies. The Murba Party having been a party that rejected foreign investments. In 1967, Malik, together with the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Singapore would officially form ASEAN in a bid to form a united front in the face of Communist expansion in Vietnam. ==New Order== With Suharto finally elected as President in 1968, Malik continued to serve as the Foreign Affairs Minister. In 1970, Malik solidified his position with the regime by officially joining Golkar. Malik would also represent Indonesia and deputise for Suharto in summits with Suharto not showing much interest in foreign policy in the first years of his Presidency. As Foreign Affairs Minister, Malik had differences with Suharto's ABRI Generals such as General Maraden Panggabean over the way in which Indonesia should approach its Foreign Policy in Southeast Asia. The Generals wanted Indonesia and its regional neighbours in ASEAN to have a closer security co-operation which in effect. The Generals were also in favour of sending Indonesian troops to help the South Vietnamese in the Vietnam War. On the other hand, Malik insisted that ASEAN should only be about economic, not military co-operation. In this he was supported by Suharto. Malik also adopted a softer stance towards the People's Republic of China who the Suharto regime saw as supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). In 1971, Malik was chosen as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Malik was briefly involved in the crisis that would lead to the invasion of East Timor. Malik had assured an East Timorese delegation led by Jos√© Ramos-Horta that Indonesia would not be involved in the crisis in East Timor. Suharto at first supported this stance towards East Timor but in 1975, was convinced by his Generals to intervene and invade. In 1977, Malik was replaced as Foreign Minister as he took on the Chairmanship of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) ==Vice Presidency== Malik's stint as MPR chairman would not last long however. In March 1978, Suharto had been elected President for a 3rd term and had expected Hamengkubuwono IX to continue as Vice- President. As it turned out, Hamengkubuwono refused to be nominated. After considering some alternative candidates, Suharto chose Malik to be his Vice- President. In his position as Vice-President, Malik was not afraid to criticise the Government. In 1979, he admitted that the current regime had violated the spirit of the 1945 constitution. He also criticised the increasing feudalism in the regime. A reference to Suharto, who acted in the manner of a feudal Javanese King. In 1981, Malik commented on the corruption in the regime, referring it as an \\"epidemic\\". In 1983, Malik's term as Vice- President came to an end and he was replaced by Umar Wirahadikusumah. ==Death== Malik died on 5 September 1984 at his home in Bandung, West Java, as a result of liver cancer. His body was interred in Kalibata Heroes Cemetery, Jakarta. ==Awards and commendations== In 1982, Malik received the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Award from the United Nations. He has also been recognised as a National Hero of Indonesia. ===Foreign honour=== * : Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (S.M.N.)

Pitt is best known as one of the outstanding architects of the \\"boom\\" era of the 1880s in Melbourne, designing some of the city's most elaborate High Victorian commercial buildings. He worked in a range of styles including Gothic Revival, Italianate, French Second Empire, and his own inventive eclectic compositions. He had a notable second career after the crash of the 1890s, becoming a specialist in theatres and industrial buildings. ==Early life== William Pitt was born in 1855 in MelbourneAustralian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition two years after his parents emigrated to Australia from Sunderland in England. His father, also William Pitt, ran some of the most notable cafes in Melbourne and was a practising artist. Raised in the suburb of St Kilda, he was educated at the Hofwyl School in St Kilda later attended George Henry Neighbour's college in Carlton. He later moved to the suburb of Abbotsford. ==Career== Melbourne Coffee Palace in 1881 (demolished) On Collins Street, Pitt designed both the Olderfleet building (left), and the Rialto (far right) Venetian Gothic design for the Melbourne Stock Exchange Pitt's details for the roof and tower fleche of the Olderfleet In 1875 Pitt was articled to the architect George Browne, who was something of a prodigy himself, designing the Rupertswood mansion, Her Majesty's Ballarat and The Theatre Royal on Bourke Street in the early 1870s, when he was in his mid 20s. Pitt began his own architectural practice in 1879 at the age of 24 after winning the competition for the Melbourne Coffee Palace Bourke Street (between Swanton and Russell Streets). His design of an elaborate Renaissance Revival style facade over five storeys set the tone for the level of detail he would lavish on his subsequent boom era designs. Competition wins marked the success of his early years, winning that for an equally elaborate Renaissance Revival Premier Permanent Building Society (1882), and the Falls Bridge (Queens Bridge) in the same year(neither was built to his design), His first prize winning entry in 1883 for \\"Our Lodgings\\" (later Gordon House) in Little Bourke Street, was an exception to his generally elaborate designs, being instead in an austere Tudor mode suitable for housing for the poor. Pitt's theatre work began with one of this best known buildings, and the most elaborate 19th century theatre exterior to survive in Australia, the Second Empire style Princess Theatre (1886) in Spring Street. The elaborate dome-like Mansard roofed pavilions, the each topped by crown-like cast iron capping, still makes a striking statement in Spring Street, and the sumptuous marble stair and elaborately ceilinged circle foyer are the finest Victorian era theatre interiors to survive in Australia (the auditorium itself was replaced in 1922). Perhaps following this success, in 1887, Pitt was appointed vice-president of the Victorian Institute of Architects. His largest and most ambitious commission followed soon after, the Federal Coffee Palace at the south-west corner of King Street and Collins Street. While he received a second prize for his design, he was allowed to collaborate with the winners, Ellerker & Kilburn and the result was a composite design. The massive elaborate building synthesises Renaissance revival, French Second Empire and French Renaissance elements and was both hailed and criticised for its extraordinary ebullience. Completed in 1888, the enormous building later came to epitomise the speculative land boom which was \\"Marvellous Melbourne\\" of the late 1880s. Pitt could produce equally elaborate work in variations of the Gothic revival style. The Flemish Gothic Olderfleet (1888) and the Venetian Gothic Rialto Buildings (1889) a few doors down in Collins Street are essential elements of the Rialto group, the most elaborate and cohesive commercial Victorian Streetscape in Melbourne. His other greatest work in Collins Street is the lavishly detailed Gothic Revival Stock Exchange (1888), complete with rose window, spire and vaulted 'Cathedral Room' on the ground floor. In 1890, he added the Gothic Revival Safe Deposit Building around the corner on Queen Street. His polychromatic design of the very long, 3 storeys high Denton Hat Mills (1888) in Abbotsford, Victoria began his specialisation in industrial design. He also designed Brunswick Town Hall in 1889. Tower House (1891), once a landmark on the corners of Spring and Flinders Streets, was a fairly standard Italianate body, topped by a steeply pitched Gothic roof and spiky corner tower with a witches hat roof. One of his rare residential commissions was Collendina, near Corowa NSW, built for Henry Hay Esq. in 1891, dominated by an elaborate double level cast-iron verandah. In 1892, he showed his passionate support for the Collingwood Football Club by designing a grandstand for Victoria Park for free. Like so many others, Pitt suffered a massive financial setback during the financial crisis of 1893. Not only did he lose commissions as building work practically ceased, but other investments failed. He kept his practice going however, and began a second career, designing a range of building types in the then fashionable styles, specialising in theatre and industrial projects. He is responsible for much of three of the most prominent and architecturally distinctive inner city industrial complexes in Melbourne in the Edwardian era. The first was the distinctive red-brick castellated design of additions and alterations to the Victoria Brewery on Victoria Parade in East Melbourne. The first section built to his design was completed in 1896, and he went on to design many additions into the 1910s creating the large walled complex seen today. Pitt worked for the Collinswood-based Foy & Gibson for much of his professional life, starting in the late 1880s, and this also sustained him after the crash. He designed many of the still extant buildings between 1896 and the 1910s that form the huge complex of large-scale factory buildings, whose red-brick rhythmic vertical piers and large cornices dominate Oxford and Cambridge Streets in Collingwood. A third major commission was the enormous main building of the Bryant and May Factory, built in 1909 on Church Street in inner suburban Richmond, also in a red-brick piered format, but with more lively expression than Foy & Gibson, and a street facade that included Art Nouveau details. His theatre work included numerous new theatres such as the New Opera House (later the Tivoli), Bourke Street (1900, demolished), the King's Theatre, Russell Street, Melbourne (1908, demolished), the Theatre Royal, Adelaide (1914, demolished), and in New Zealand the Opera House, Wellington (1914). These were designed in a range of styles, though the Tivoli was by far the most inventive, featuring a red brick facade with exotic Moorish horseshoe arches, topped by a globe. The others were all relatively simple classical designs, with pilasters and pedimented facades, and grand but not overly elaborate interiors. He also renovated many older theatres, such as His Majesty's Ballarat, where he inserted new balconies in 1898 and Her Majesty's, Pitt Street, Sydney (1903, demolished), where he inserted a new interior following a fire, and a completely new interior for the Theatre Royal, Hobart in 1911. His work even extended to one of the first luxury cinema buildings in Melbourne, the Hoyts De Luxe in Bourke Street (1915, facade remains under later cladding). Some declared him at the time to be the greatest theatre architect in Australia.http://www.hermaj.com/CMS/index2.php?option=content&task;=view&id;=10&pop;=1&page;=0 Another rare foray into residential architecture in this period was Avalon (1903) at 70 Queens Road, demolished 2008. Other projects include the Victorian Racing Club (1910), Collins Street (demolished), and a number of hotels such as the Charles Hotham Hotel (1912), on the corner of Spencer and Flinders Streets.

A rare residential commission. Derelict in 2008, demolished in March 2011. ==Public life== Like many successful men of this period, Pitt took an active part in public life. He was an active member of the Australian Natives' Association, the Freemasons, a patron of the Collingwood Football Club, and a member of the Melbourne Harbour Trust from 1894 to 1913 (chairman, 1901‚Äì05). He was a staunch protectionist and a vocal supporter of the Australian Federation Movement, and acted on these views while a member of the Victorian Parliament. He sat in the Victorian Legislative Council from 1891 to 1910, first for North Yarra Province until 1904, then Melbourne East Province until 1910. He was also active in local politics, elected to the City of Collingwood council in 1888, where he was the mayor for 1890, before retiring from council in 1894. In 1891‚Äì92 he sat on the Melbourne Board of Works as the representative of the City of Collingwood. ==Personal life== Pitt married Elizabeth Mary Liddy on 23 October 1889 at St Peter's Church. On 25 May 1918, he died at home in Abbotsford, and was buried in St Kilda General Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, three daughters and a son. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1855 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Australian federationists Category:Architects from Melbourne Category:Politicians from Melbourne ","title":"William Pitt (architect)"},{"id":"1432625","text":"Bernardo Pisano (also Pagoli) (October 12, 1490 - January 23, 1548) was an Italian composer, priest, singer, and scholar of the Renaissance. He was one of the first madrigalists, and the first composer anywhere to have a printed collection of secular music devoted entirely to himself. == Life == He was born in Florence, and may have spent some time in Pisa (hence his name). As a young man he sang and studied music at the church of Annunziata in Florence. In 1512 he became maestro di cappella there, a job which held in addition to supervising the choristers and singing in its various chapels. Evidently he was favored of the Medici, for they not only hired him for his church job but gave him a post as a singer in the papal chapel in Rome in 1514, immediately after Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici became Pope Leo X. Sometime during the period 1512 to 1520 he was the teacher of Francesco Corteccia, organist and composer to Cosimo I de' Medici. Pisano remained based in Rome for the rest of his life. In addition to singing in the papal chapel choir, he acquired ecclesiastical benefices from the Pope, including one each at the cathedrals of Seville and Lerida. Between 1515 and 1519 he traveled between Florence and Rome, holding musical positions in both cities, but in 1520 he returned to Rome, except for occasional visits to Florence. Pisano made the mistake of returning to Florence in 1529, during the three-year period of republican government, the result of a successful coup d'√©tat against the Medici. Since he had obviously close connections to the Medici, he was accused of being a spy for the papacy, seized, imprisoned, and put to torture. In September 1529 the famous siege of Florence began, and he was released. In 1530 Florence was captured by papal troops and the Medici returned to power. After escaping alive from his former home, he returned to Rome to stay. In 1546 Pope Paul III appointed him maestro di cappella of his private chapel, a position which he only held for two years, for he died in 1548. Among the singers in this elite group was Jacques Arcadelt, who was to become even more famous than Pisano as a madrigal composer. == Music and influence == While Pisano wrote sacred music in a sober, homophonic style, probably intended to be used during his tenure as maestro di cappella at Ss. Annunziata, it was as a composer of secular music that he was most influential. Pisano is arguably the first madrigalist. In 1520, Venetian printer Ottaviano Petrucci published his Musica di messer Bernardo Pisano sopra le canzone del Petrarcha, a collection of settings of Petrarch influenced by the literary theories of Pietro Bembo; while the pieces in the collection were not yet called \\"madrigals\\", they contained several features recognized in retrospect as distinctive of the genre: the set serious texts, the placement of words and accents was done carefully, and they contained word-painting. This publication was also the first collection of secular music by a single composer ever to be printed; previous publications, in the brief two decades since moveable type had first been used for printing music, had been anthologies only.D'Accone, Grove online The slightly later composers who became famous masters of the madrigal genre -- Costanzo Festa, Jacques Arcadelt, Philippe Verdelot -- were aware of his work and copied some of his stylistic traits. Pisano's early secular music is typical of Italian music of the first two decades of the 16th century: light, rhythmically active, usually homophonic, containing frequent repetition, and generally for three voices. Most of these pieces are ballatas or canzonettas. His later secular music, including the important collection of 1520, the first printed book of secular music dedicated to the work of a single composer, contains music which is best defined as madrigalian (although he did not use the term). Poetry is sometimes serious, and sometimes humorous; seven poems by Petrarch are represented. The music carefully attempts to convey the emotion expressed by the poem being set. Often the last line of the text is repeated for emphasis, a peculiarity which was to become a defining feature of the early madrigal. Texturally, the music varies between homophonic and polyphonic passages, as well as between passages for groups of two, three, and four singers together. ==References== * Frank D'Accone: \\"Bernardo Pisano\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

Mount Komagatake, an active volcano, is located to the east of Mori, and much of the town is part of ≈ånuma Quasi- National Park. Mori is the home of ikameshi, a squid and rice dish invented in the mid-20th century. ==Etymology== The name of the town originates from the word \\"Oniushi\\", meaning \\"a forested area\\" in the Ainu language. In the Japanese language the name of the town is written as , meaning forest. The suffix \\"\\", denoting town status in Japan, is pronounced as -ch≈ç in every municipality of Hokkaido with the exception of Mori, where it is read as -machi. ==Geography== Mount Komagatake viewed from ≈ånuma, Mori Mori sits on the eastern coast of the Oshima Peninsula and overlooks Uchiura Bay ( in diameter). The bay, also known as Funka Bay, is rich in squid and is the site of scallop aquaculture, both a mainstay of the town economy. Much of the town of Mori is mountainous or hilly. Hokkaid≈ç Komagatake is an active andesitic stratovolcano on the east of Mori where the town borders the nearby municipalities of Shikabe and Nanae. Major eruptions of Komagatake are recorded as early as 1640, and ash fallout from the volcano is frequent. Mount Gujin (1,113) sits to the west. Volcanic ash from Komagatake covers the town and provides a rich soil for vegetable cultivation. Mori is crossed by several small rivers, including the Torizaki River (), Oshironai River(), Katsura River (), Nigori River (), Shukunobe River (), and the ËåÇÁÑ°ÈÉ®Â∑ù (). Mori, along with the town of Nanae, shares a coastline on Lake ≈ånuma (). ≈ånuma, connected to Lake Konuma in Nanae, is technically a shallow pond. ≈ånuma and Konuma, which sit at the southern foot of Mount Komagatake, were created when mudflows from an eruption of the mountain dammed the Orito River. Komagatake, as well as ≈ånuma and Konuma, are protected as part of ≈ånuma Quasi-National Park (), which covers much of eastern Mori. The park is home to alpine plant species such as iwabukuro, a flowering plant of the family Scrophulariaceae, and urajirotade, a flowering plant of the family Polygonaceae. The middle reaches of Komagatake is home to stands of broadleaf trees, including mineyanagi, a species of willow, doronoki, a Populus species, birches, and mizunara, a species of oak. ≈ånuma is home to watershields, carp, and wakasagi, a species of smelt used in Japanese cuisine. ==Neighboring municipalities== The coast of Uchiura Bay forms the northern border of Mori. The town is bordered by five other municipalities by land: Hokuto and Nanae make up the town's broad southern border, Shikabe and Yakumo make up its short eastern and western borders respectively. Mori shares a border with Assabu to the southwest, high in the Oshima Mountain Range. *Oshima Subprefecture **Shikabe **Hokuto **Nanae **Yakumo *Hiyama Subprefecture **Assabu ==History== Mori was settled early in Japanese history as evidenced by the J≈çmon-period archaeological sites now designated as the Washinoki Site. The town was settled by the Japanese in the 15th century. The settlement, like many other coastal areas of Hokkaido, was established as a Pacific herring fishing base. Fishermen operating out of Hakodate noted the richness of herring in the Mori area, and soon established a base in Mori. The base became the village of Washinoki, and was administered as part of Hakodate. K≈çb≈ç Abe (1836 - 1908), a samurai and naval commander of the Tokugawa shogunate, lost the capitol at Edo to forces loyal to the Meiji Emperor as 1868 as part of the Boshin War (1868 - 1869). Enomoto fled from Edo and landed his fleet of eight steam warships, the remainder of the Tokugawa Navy, a Washinoki en route to establishing a base at Hakodate. The present-day town of Mori became part of Enomoto's Republic of Ezo. Enomoto and the republic were soon defeated in the Naval Battle of Hakodate (1869), and all of Hokkaido, including the villages of Mori, came under the rule of the central Japanese government. Mori was incorporated as a town in 1921. A great fire broke out in the town in 1961 and half of Mori was burned, with 554 homes destroyed . The town of Sawara (from Kayabe District) was merged into Mori on April 1, 2005. ==Economy== The fishing industry of Mori focuses on the aquaculture of scallops. The volcanic ash from Mount Komagatake has created a rich soil for fruit and vegetable production in Mori. The town is noted for its production of melons, tomatoes, pumpkins and prunes. Sawara is noted for its production of blueberries and at the town's Michi No Eki, you can sample blueberry jam and ice cream. == Transportation == Mori Station ===Rail=== Mori is connected by rail via the JR Hokkaido Hakodate Main Line, which connects Hakodate to Sapporo, and continues to Asahikawa in north-central Hokkaido. Stations along the Hakodate Main Line in Mori were completed between 1903 and 1904. Mori Station serves the central business and administrative district of the town. The Sawara Branch Line, which runs between Mori Station and ≈ånuma Station in Nanae, serves several small stations in the Sawara area. Stations along the Hakodate Main Line in Mori were completed in 1945. *Hakodate Main Line **Stations: Akaigawa -- Komagatake -- Higashiyama -- Himekawa‚ÄîMori -- Katsuragawa -- Ishiya -- Hon-Ishikura -- Ishikura *Sawara Branch Line **Stations: Oshima-Mumajiri -- Oshima-Sawara -- Kakarima -- Oshironai -- Higashi-Mori‚ÄîMori Station ===Highways=== Japan National Route 5, a national highway of Japan, runs through the town and is the main highway to Hakodate with the rest of Hokkaido. Route 5 runs north through Yakumo and Oshamanbe and then veers east towards the Shakotan peninsula and into the town Otaru before connecting to Sapporo. Japan National Route 229 was completed in 1971. ==Culture and cuisine== Ikameshi ===Festivals=== The annual town matsuri festival of Mori is held in early August. The festival is associated with the Mori Inari Shrine, and includes the carrying of mikoshi throughout the central Mori district, taiko drumming, and stalls serving ramen and other Japanese cuisine. ===Ikameshi=== Mori is the home of ikameshi, a dish composed of squid cooked with rice inside. Mori Station bent≈ç vendor Abe Bent≈çten invented ikameshi in 1941 as a result of food rationing during World War II. Japanese flying squid were caught in plentiful supply near Mori, and used as a way to ration rice. The Abe Bent≈çten store continues as the Ikameshi Abeshoten Co., a bent≈ç and prepared foods company, located in Mori, with a shop at Mori Station. ==Education== Mori is home to one high school, Mori Prefectural High School, a public high school operated by the Prefecture of Hokkaido. The high school was established in 1941 as a girl's high school run by the Town of Mori, but became a coeducation high school run by the prefecture in 1948. The Town of Mori Board of Education maintains two middle schools: Mori Middle School and Sawara Middle School. The town is home to six elementary schools. There are several empty elementary school buildings due to the declining population of the town, the most recent closings being Ishikura elementary school in 2017 and Akaigawa elementary school in 2011. ==Services== Mori Post Office ===Post=== The town of Mori is served by four post offices. The main post office is in the Miyukich≈ç district, in close proximity to the Mori Town Hall. ==Local government== Keiz≈ç Kajiya (b. 1956), a graduate of Ashikaga Institute of Technology and mayor of the former town of Sawara, was elected mayor of Mori on October 16, 2012. ==See also== *J≈çmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaid≈ç, Northern T≈çhoku, and other regions ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido Category:Populated places established in the 15th century ","title":"Mori, Hokkaido"},{"id":"1432641","text":"The area of Kayabe District in Oshima Subprefecture. is a district located in Oshima Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

He was born in Carora in the state of Lara, and was the younger brother of pediatrics pioneer, Pastor Oropeza Riera. In his youth, he opposed the totalitarian regime of President Juan Vicente G√≥mez and became a member of the student-led movement called \\"Generation of 1928\\". He was imprisoned and eventually sent into exile with some of the other group members. In 1931, he worked as a correspondent for √âlite Magazine in Madrid, Spain. Upon his return to Venezuela he became a founding member of Acci√≥n Democr√°tica, one of the two most prominent political parties in the nation's republican history, alongside such important figures as Luis Beltr√°n Prieto Figueroa, Mariano Pic√≥n Salas and later Venezuelan President R√≥mulo Betancourt. In 1944, he married Venezuelan Alicia Sosa in the state of Sonora, Mexico, in 1944. After the coup d'√©tat that ousted Isaias Medina Angarita, he became the rector of the Universidad Central de Venezuela (Central University of Venezuela) and was subsequently appointed Venezuela's ambassador to the United Kingdom under President R√≥mulo Gallegos's term. He took up Paris as his permanent residence during the dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, where he befriended such personalities as poet Paul √âluard, writers Jorge Luis Borges, Nicol√°s Guill√©n, Miguel √Ångel Asturias and painters Salvador Dal√≠, Marie Laurencin and Pablo Picasso. In the 1960s, he continued his duties as the Venezuelan ambassador in Paris for R√≥mulo Betancourt's administration. During that time, he was also chosen to represent Venezuela as its ambassador before UNESCO and, during Ra√∫l Leoni's presidency, was assigned to the position of Venezuelan ambassador in Bogot√°, Colombia, the highest honor any Venezuelan diplomatic official can achieve.

It resembles the closely related black rail of The Americas. It is threatened by introduced species, such as goats and cats, and is considered vulnerable. ==Description== The Galapagos crake is a small (15 cm) nearly flightless ground living bird. It has dark plumage, black overall with a greyer head and breast, and white spots on the back. It has a scarlet eye, a black bill, and short, nearly useless wings. They are very vocal with a wide range of calls. ==Habits== The Galapagos crake lives in moist grasslands and forest, skulking in deep cover. In the Galapagos these habitats are generally found on islands with higher elevations (particularly on the islands of Santiago, Santa Cruz and Sierra Negra), and the rails are commonest higher up. They feed on invertebrates, mostly snails, isopods, dragonflies, bugs, ants, also taking berries and some seeds. They feed during the day, moving along the ground tossing leaves and investigating the leaf litter. Unlike many island-dwelling rails, the Galapagos rail can fly, though not very well and not for long distances. Its flight has been described as awkward and laboured. ==Galapagos crakes and humans== The Galapagos crake, despite being a nearly flightless island living rail, has managed to survive the arrival of humans in the Galapagos. It is a confiding species that is curious of humans and will approach and investigate them, this naivety makes it vulnerable to feral cats, dogs and pigs. Introduced goats and cattle also cause habitat loss that causes a drop in their numbers. The removal of goats and cattle, and the resulting regeneration of trees, shrubs and grasses, leads quickly to a return of the rail. As most of the Galapagos crake's habitat lies in a national park, and efforts are underway to remove the introduced species doing the most harm, the future is looking better for these birds. ==References== * Taylor, B.

In other words, f is a choice function for X if and only if it belongs to the direct product of X. == An example == Let X = { {1,4,7}, {9}, {2,7} }. Then the function that assigns 7 to the set {1,4,7}, 9 to {9}, and 2 to {2,7} is a choice function on X. == History and importance == Ernst Zermelo (1904) introduced choice functions as well as the axiom of choice (AC) and proved the well-ordering theorem, which states that every set can be well-ordered. AC states that every set of nonempty sets has a choice function. A weaker form of AC, the axiom of countable choice (ACœâ) states that every countable set of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, in the absence of either AC or ACœâ, some sets can still be shown to have a choice function. *If X is a finite set of nonempty sets, then one can construct a choice function for X by picking one element from each member of X. This requires only finitely many choices, so neither AC or ACœâ is needed. *If every member of X is a nonempty set, and the union \\\\bigcup X is well- ordered, then one may choose the least element of each member of X. In this case, it was possible to simultaneously well-order every member of X by making just one choice of a well-order of the union, so neither AC nor ACœâ was needed. (This example shows that the well-ordering theorem implies AC. The converse is also true, but less trivial.) == Choice function of a multivalued map == Given two sets X and Y, let F be a multivalued map from X and Y (equivalently, F:X\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{P}(Y)is a function from X to the power set of Y). A function f: X \\\\rightarrow Y is said to be a selection of F, if: :\\\\forall x \\\\in X \\\\, ( f(x) \\\\in F(x) ) \\\\,. The existence of more regular choice functions, namely continuous or measurable selections is important in the theory of differential inclusions, optimal control, and mathematical economics. See Selection theorem. ==Bourbaki tau function== Nicolas Bourbaki used epsilon calculus for their foundations that had a \\\\tau symbol that could be interpreted as choosing an object (if one existed) that satisfies a given proposition. So if P(x) is a predicate, then \\\\tau_{x}(P) is one particular object that satisfies P (if one exists, otherwise it returns an arbitrary object). Hence we may obtain quantifiers from the choice function, for example P( \\\\tau_{x}(P)) was equivalent to (\\\\exists x)(P(x)). However, Bourbaki's choice operator is stronger than usual: it's a global choice operator. That is, it implies the axiom of global choice.John Harrison, \\"The Bourbaki View\\" eprint. Hilbert realized this when introducing epsilon calculus.\\"Here, moreover, we come upon a very remarkable circumstance, namely, that all of these transfinite axioms are derivable from a single axiom, one that also contains the core of one of the most attacked axioms in the literature of mathematics, namely, the axiom of choice: A(a)\\\\to A(\\\\varepsilon(A)), where \\\\varepsilon is the transfinite logical choice function.\\" Hilbert (1925), ‚ÄúOn the Infinite‚Äù, excerpted in Jean van Heijenoort, From Frege to G√∂del, p. 382.

KCBS-FM airs an adult hits music format branded as \\"93.1 Jack FM\\". Unlike other radio stations airing the Jack FM format, KCBS-FM runs a fairly focused playlist of popular classic rock and alternative rock tracks. Currently, the station has no air staff except for Crystal Z with her \\"Jacktivities\\" (events and whatever announcements deemed worthy by \\"Jack\\") and Howard Cogan supplying prerecorded quips and remarks between songs. Unlike most other stations in this format, the call sign does not include any form of the word \\"Jack,\\" opting instead to hold over the call letters from a previous format, including the station's former corporate identity. This is similar to its sister station in New York City, which maintained its WCBS-FM call letters during its two-year run as \\"Jack FM\\" from 2005 to 2007. Although Jack proclaims that the station is run \\"in a dumpy little building in beautiful downtown Culver City\\", studios and offices for KCBS-FM are actually at the intersection of Venice Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, about half a mile north of Culver City. The station's transmitter is based on Mount Wilson. ==History== On March 30, 1948, the station signed on as KNX-FM. KNX-FM was a simulcast of its AM sister station KNX until the mid-1960s. The station, along with other CBS-owned FM radio stations, aired a beautiful music format branded as \\"The Young Sound\\". In 1971, KNX-FM switched to a mellow rock music format, featuring artists heard on other rock stations but choosing softer selections than heard on rivals KLOS and KMET. (A group of volunteers launched an internet stream recreating the KNX format of the 1971-1983 era in 2019.) https://www.sgvtribune.com/2019/05/06/radio-how-the-mellow-sound-of-knx-fm-is- sounding-online/ On August 25, 1983, KNX-FM adopted a Top 40 music format, similar to the other CBS Radio FM stations - and branded as \\"Hitradio 93 KKHR\\". The heritage KNX-FM call sign was switched to KKHR. KKHR was not a traditional Top 40 music format of the time as the playlist was more stringently limited to 30 songs. The original KKHR disc jockey staff consisted of Lou Simon, Dave Donovan (whose real name is Joe Cipriano), Chris Lance, Todd Parker (replaced by Jack Armstrong several months later), and Mark Hanson. In 1986, the Top 40 format ran its course on 93.1 due to its lackluster ratings. The mellow rock music format and heritage KNX-FM call letters were returned under the new branding \\"Quality Rock\\".https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-05-29-ca-7969-story.html KNX-FM struggled with low listener ratings, and wasn't able to re-capture its original audience.https://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-03/entertainment/ca-291_1_call- letters On March 2, 1989, at 12:00 p.m., following a day-long stunt with a ticking clock during songs and an announcement from vice president and general manager Charlie Seraphin, an oldies music format was introduced and the heritage KNX-FM callsign was dropped yet again, this time in favor of KODJ to complement the change in branding to \\"Oldies 93.1\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-03-03.pdf KODJ competed with crosstown rival KRTH, which later came under common CBS Radio ownership when ownership limits were relaxed by the FCC. KODJ focused more on the 1950s and the early 1960s era of oldies music than rival KRTH. DJs on KODJ were The Real Don Steele, Charlie Tuna, Rich Fields, Machine Gun Kelly and Jeff Serr. In response to KODJ's debut, KRTH gradually reduced and eventually faded out the amount of newer songs from its playlist, focused mainly on the 1960s decade of oldies with a selected number of top songs from the late 1950s. In addition, KRTH brought in Bill Drake as consultant while featuring all new jingles by the Johnny Mann Singers, which helped it reach higher ratings.http://www.reelradio.com/bdrake/index.html The Real Don Steele left KCBS-FM in mid-1992 to join KRTH. Charlie Tuna the morning host at KODJ/KCBS- FM from 1989‚Äì1993 would later work at KRTH from 2008‚Äì2014. On July 12, 1991, at 2 p.m., KODJ changed to its present callsign, KCBS-FM as part of an re- imaging marking campaign to bring in new listeners believing the \\"CBS-FM\\" call letters had a more stronger association with the oldies format.https://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-17/entertainment/ca-2172_1_cbs- radio These call letters had previously been used by two CBS-affiliated stations (now KSOL and KLLC) in San Francisco. KCBS-FM still kept the oldies format, but shifted its focus mainly to the 1960s decade of oldies with a lesser selection of 1950s oldies, and more early 1970's rock oldies to better compete with KRTH.https://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-04/business/fi-1231_1_program- director Due to continued low ratings and KRTH holding the majority share of the oldies market, on September 10, 1993, at 3 p.m., KCBS-FM flipped to a classic rock/classic hits format, and branded itself as \\"Arrow 93FM, All Rock and Roll Oldies\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-09-17.pdf \\"Arrow\\" focused its new oldies format on the late 1960s and the entire 1970s decade with an emphasis on only classic rock oldies that did not include pop, bubble gum, disco, or doo-wop music.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3UQrrlPsRk The listener Arbitron ratings for KCBS-FM went from 18th to 3rd place by the end of 1993, making the new format an immediate success.https://web.archive.org/web/20000229223046/http://www.arrowfm.com/us/bradwest.shtml The station kept the KCBS-FM call letters, but would only quickly identify its call sign once at the top of the hour per FCC station identification requirements. The format would later evolve towards classic rock of the late 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, and re-branded itself as \\"Arrow 93FM, All Rock & Roll Classics\\" in 1996.https://web.archive.org/web/19961029055537/http://www.arrowfm.com/ Infinity Broadcasting (as CBS Radio was known at the time) won the licensing rights to brand its adult hits music formatted radio stations as \\"Jack FM\\". Many Infinity/CBS Radio stations adopted the adult hits format and \\"Jack-FM\\" branding which led to yet another format change for KCBS-FM. On March 17, 2005 (St. Patrick's Day), after an all-day stunt with music from U2 (as that band is from Ireland), the classic rock format was dropped in favor of adult hits, branded as \\"93-1 Jack-FM\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-03-25.pdf The Jack format was a break from the heavily niched formats that had developed beginning in the 1970s. Jack was also unusual in that it employed no DJs, and had a much larger playlist than the typical classic hits or classic rock radio station. The Los Angeles incarnation of Jack includes more modern rock titles than most Jack outlets, reflecting the local influence of KROQ during its alternative heyday. The station debuted with a blend of pop and rock from the late 1960s to late 1980s, with a sprinkling of newer, sometimes almost current, tunes. Eventually, the newer songs and pop songs were phased out in favor of mostly classic rock and classic alternative. KCBS-FM is the longest-serving of all of CBS' Jack stations. Though the station has no DJs, KCBS-FM will occasionally respond to current events, such as playing all Michael Jackson songs following his death, or spinning a celebratory tune or two following a local sports victory. The \\"voice\\" of Jack FM is a real person named Howard Cogan. His quips which are heard between songs are created by a team of writers. As Jack became popular, Cogan moved to Los Angeles to record his comments more easily. He is also the voice-over artist for other \\"Jack FM\\" stations around the country. In October 2008, CBS Radio chose not to move the KCBS-FM call letters to its sister station 106.9 in San Francisco, after that station flipped from classic hits to an all-news simulcast of 740 KCBS. That station remains KFRC-FM, heritage calls in themselves. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger As part of the merger, the FM radio rights to the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League were moved to KCBS from KSWD, which was sold off as part of the deal when it flipped to Contemporary Christian format as KKLQ on November 16, 2017. ==KCBS-FM HD== In addition to the main Jack FM format on HD1, 93.1 HD-2 broadcasts CBS Sports Radio. Before KLSX switched from Talk to CHR in 2009, 93.1 HD2 carried a CHR format with the ‚ÄúAMP Radio‚Äù branding. Former sister station KFWB had been broadcasting on the KCBS-FM HD3 signal, but due to that station's sale, its signal is no longer heard on KCBS-FM.

The college's radio station WBWC is known throughout the Cleveland area. ==History== Marting Hall Presidential candidate Barack Obama speaking at BW's Lou Higgins center in 2008 Both the university and the town of Berea were founded by Methodist settlers from Connecticut. These settlers moved west after their homes were burned by the British in the Revolutionary War. The region in Northern Ohio became known as the Western Reserve (a part of which was designated the Firelands, as the state of Connecticut gave land grants to these fire victims). Among early settlers of this area was John Baldwin. Baldwin enjoyed early success in the sandstone quarry industry. He eventually founded Baldwin Institute in 1845. Baldwin Institute became Baldwin University in 1856. Baldwin's sense of equality led to the school accepting any student regardless of race or gender, and was one of the first in the nation to do so. Moreover, Baldwin University's courses were not segregated. The surge of German workers in Baldwin's sandstone quarries led to the establishment of a German department at the Institute. { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width:22em;\\" id=\\"Presidents of Baldwin-Wallace College\\" ! colspan=2 style=\\"text-align: center; background:#654321;color:white;\\"  Presidents of Baldwin Wallace - ! style=\\"width:80%;\\"President ! style=\\"width:20%;\\"Years - Arthur Louis Breslich (1913‚Äì1918) - Albert Boynton Storms (1918‚Äì1933) - Louis C.

Students at both institutions were free to enroll in courses at Baldwin or German Wallace. Baldwin and Wallace were the primary benefactors to the two Berea colleges. After their deaths, and the decline of the quarry industry in Ohio, Baldwin University came close to financial ruin. Options were thin, and the United Methodist Church considered merging the schools with the more successful Ohio Wesleyan University in 1874, to form the University of Cleveland. The University of Cleveland concept was abandoned for a more elegant solution. Baldwin University and German Wallace College merged in 1913 to form Baldwin‚ÄìWallace College. The college's present day campus can be much accredited to the leadership of Alfred Bryan Bonds; through much of the mid-20th century, Baldwin Wallace grew to be a large and well respected suburban institution. Bonds oversaw the construction of fifteen buildings on campus during his 26-year tenure. Neal Malicky's tenure as college president stabilized the college's finances and endowment, finally placing Baldwin Wallace in financial security after years of financial struggle. Following Malicky's presidency, Mark Collier served as president for seven years, overseeing a campus master plan that has led to many major renovations on campus. In recent years the college has expanded and renovated residence halls and academic buildings. In addition, the college has purchased existing buildings in the Berea community for academic and student residential use. In the fall of 2011, a task force was developed by BW President Dick Durst. On February 11, 2012, it was announced that Baldwin‚ÄìWallace College would become Baldwin Wallace University after approval by the BW Board of Trustees. The name would become effective on July 1 of 2012, with complete implementation by the end of 2012. In addition to the new university designation, seal, and logo, \\"B-W\\" would drop the hyphen in its name. In recent years, BW has been a stopping point for political candidates. During the 2008 Presidential campaign, BW hosted eventual President Barack Obama and 2008 Presidential candidate John McCain. In 2012 BW hosted vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan along with Condoleezza Rice. The last sitting President prior to Obama to visit BW was Ronald Reagan during George H. W. Bush's 1988 Presidential run. The 2016 Presidential campaign resulted in visits from Bernie Sanders and BW hosting Ohio Governor John Kasich's Ohio Presidential Primary election night party. ==Academics== Carnegie Hall part of the Malicky Center Baldwin Wallace offers more than 80 majors, as well as several cooperative and pre-professional programs.

Homecoming offers a parade, football event, and a large Alumni gathering. ==Athletics== George Finnie Stadium home to Tressel Field BW's mascot \\"Stinger\\" BW's school colors are officially brown and gold, though in the past they adopted burgundy and teal as well as maroon and gold for their marketing literature. The school's varsity sports teams are the Baldwin Wallace Yellow Jackets. They participate in the NCAA's Division III and the Ohio Athletic Conference. The university has long rivalries with John Carroll University and University of Mount Union. Lou Higgins Center is home to the physical education department, athletics, and recreational sports and services. The Lou Higgins Center was renovated and expanded in 2005. Beyond Varsity Athletics, Baldwin Wallace offers club sports, Intramurals, Aerobic Classes, a Fitness Center and Weight Room. Higgins Center is home to many of the athletic offices, along with Bagley Hall. Bagley Hall was originally owned by the Cleveland Browns and was used as the team's summer training facility. After the Browns left for Baltimore, the university converted the facility into a residence hall. In 2012, Bagley Hall was converted into athletic offices. Baldwin Wallace's football team was coached by Lee Tressel, who led the team to an undefeated record in 1978, and subsequently the NCAA Division III Championship. In 2008, the athletic turf on George Finnie Stadium was renovated and named \\"Tressel Field\\" in honor of the Tressel Family. Perhaps the most notable BW athlete from the 20th century was Harrison Dillard, the only male so far to win Olympic titles in both sprinting and hurdling events, in the 1948 Summer Olympics. The teams of the Sidney High School Yellow Jackets were named after Baldwin Wallace graduate Granville Robinson became Head Coach at Sidney High School. In 2009, after almost 20 years of use, BW adopted a new logo and modified the mascot for the athletic teams.B-W: Stinger Has a new Look . Bw.edu.

Zulfaqar (, ', IPA: [√∞u‚Äøl.fa.qaÀêr]), also spelled Zu al-Faqar, Zulfiqar, Dhu al-Faqar, Dhulfaqar or Dhulfiqar, is the sword of Ali ibn Abi Talib. It was historically frequently depicted as a scissor-like double bladed sword on Muslim flags, and it is commonly shown in Shia depictions of Ali and in the form of jewelry functioning as talismans as a scimitar terminating in two points. Middle Eastern weapons are commonly inscribed with a quote mentioning Zulfiqar, and Middle Eastern swords are at times made with a split tip in reference to the weapon. ==Name== The meaning of the name is uncertain. The word ·∏èu () means \\"possessor, master\\", and the idafa construction \\"possessor of...\\" is common in Arabic phraseology, such as in Dhu al-Qarnayn, Dhu al- Kifl, Dhu al-Qadah and Dhu al-Hijjah. The meaning of faqƒÅr (), means \\"splitter, differentiatior\\". It is often vocalized as fiqƒÅr instead of faqƒÅr; Lane cites authorities preferring faqƒÅr and rejecting fiqƒÅr as \\"vulgar\\", but the vocalization fiqƒÅr still sees the more widespread use. The word faqƒÅr has the meaning of \\"the vertebrae of the back, the bones of the spine, which are set in regular order, one upon another\\", but may also refer to other instances of regularly spaced rows, specifically it is a name of the stars of the belt of Orion. Interpretations of the sword's name as found in Islamic theological writings or popular piety fall into four categories:Christoph Heger in: Markus Gro√ü and Karl-Heinz Ohlig (eds.), Schlaglichter: Die beiden ersten islamischen Jahrhunderte, 2008, pp. 278-290. *reference to the literal vertebrae of the spine, yielding an interpretation in the sense of \\"the severer of the vertebrae; the spine-splitter\\" *reference to the stars of the belt of Orion, emphasizing the celestial provenance of the sword *interpretation of faqƒÅr as an unfamiliar plural of fuqrah \\"notch, groove, indentation\\", interpreted as a reference to a kind of decoration of regularly spaced notches or dents on the sword *reference to a \\"notch\\" formed by the sword's supposed termination in two points The latter interpretation gives rise to the popular depiction of the sword as a double-pointed scimitar in modern Shia iconography. Heger (2008) considers two additional possibilities: *the name in origin referred simply to a double-edged sword (i.e. an actual sword rather than a sabre or scimitar), the ŒºŒ¨œáŒ±ŒπœÅŒ± Œ¥ŒØœÉœÑŒøŒºŒ∑ of the New Testament *fiqƒÅr is a corruption of firƒÅq \\"distinction, division\\", and the name originally referred to the metaphorical sword discerning between right and wrong. ==Invocation and depiction== Calligraphic panel in praise of Ali. The large inscription at the top reads lƒÅ fatƒÅ  æilƒÅ  øAlƒ´ lƒÅ sayf  æilƒÅ ·∏é≈´ l-FiqƒÅr. A stamped amulet, presumably made in India in the 19th century for a Shia patron. The amulet comprises magic squares, Qur'anic verses (including ayat al-kursi (2:255) running around the frame), divine or holy names, besides a depiction of Zulfiqar at the center. Zulfiqar was frequently depicted on Ottoman flags, especially as used by Janissaries cavalry, in the 16th and 17th centuries. Zulfiqar is also frequently invoked in talismans. A common talismanic inscription or invocation is the double statement: : : :\\"There is no sword but the Zulfiqar, and there is no youth but Ali\\" The order of the two-part phrase is sometimes reversed, instead saying \\"there is no youth but Ali, and there is no sword but the Zulfiqar\\". A record of this statement as part of a longer talismanic inscription was published by Tewfik Canaan in The Decipherment of Arabic Talismans (1938). Heger (2008) speculates that the talismanic formula may be old and may have originated as a Christian invocation.reprinted 2004 in Magic and Divination in Early Islam, pp. 125-177, cited after Heger (2008) p. 283. ==Legendary background== In legend, the exclamation is attributed to Muhammad, who is said to have uttered it in the Battle of Uhud in praise of Ali's exploit of splitting the shield and helmet of the strongest Meccan warrior, shattering his own sword in the same stroke. Muhammad is said to then have given his own sword Dhu-l-Fiqar to Ali to replace the broken sword. In another variant, the exclamation is not due to Muhammad but to \\"a voice on the battlefield\\", and the sword was given to Ali by archangel Gabriel directly.Heger (2008), p. 286. Al-Tirmidhi attributes to Ibn Abbas the tradition that Muhammad acquired the sword on the day of Badr, after he had seen it in a dream concerning the day of Uhud. According to the Twelver Shia, the Dh≈´ al-FiqƒÅr is currently in the possession of the Imam in occultation Hujjat-Allah al-Mahdi, alongside other religious relics, such as the al-Jafr. ==Modern references== In Qajar Iran, actual swords were produced based on the legendary double-pointed design. Thus, the Higgins Collection holds a ceremonial sabre with a wootz steel blade, dated to the late 19th century, with a cleft tip. The curator comments that \\"fractures in the tip were not uncommon in early wootz blades from Arabia\\" suggesting that the legendary double-pointed design is based on a common type of damage incurred by blades in battle. The tip of this specimen is split in the blade plane, i.e. \\"For about 8\\" of its length from the point the blade is vertically divided along its axis, producing side-by-side blades, each of which is finished in itself\\", in the curator's opinion \\"a virtuoso achievement by a master craftsman\\".Higgins Collection, Accession Number 321.a. Another 19th-century blade in the same collection features a split blade as well as saw-tooths along the edge, combining two possible interpretations of the name Dhu-l- Faqar. This blade is likely of Indian workmanship, and it was combined with an older (Mughal era) Indian hilt.Higgins Collection, Accession Number 2240. \\"Zulfiqar\\" and its phonetic variations has come into use as given name, as with former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In Iran, the name of the sword has been used as an eponym in military contexts; thus, Reza Shah Pahlavi renamed the military order Portrait of the Commander of Faithful to Order of Zolfaghar in 1925. The 58th Takavar Division of Shahroud is also named after the sword. An Iranian main battle tank is also named after the sword, Zulfiqar. During the Bosnian War, a Bosnian army's special unit was named \\"Zulfikar\\". ==Gallery== File:Sword_and_shield_reproduction_from_Bab_al_Nasr_gate_Cairo_Egypt.jpgDrawing of Fatimid version of Zulfiqar in the 10th-century; which is the earliest visual depiction in history, as carved on Bab al-Nasr, one of the gates of Cairo.

They were partly motivated by the desire to provide reliable postal service for merchants and other foreign nationals in major cities, and partly by suspicion of the local postal service. The currency in use could be either the local currency, or that of the home country.

Created by Gilbert Hernandez, Luba was the protagonist for his main contribution to the Hernandez brothers' groundbreaking comic book Love and Rockets. Based largely in a small Central American village named Palomar, the Luba stories follow the progress of Luba and her ever increasing family through the years. Luba was ranked 60th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. From the outset Luba is portrayed as a beautiful, fiery-tempered woman with enormous breasts and an eye for younger men, often depicted in random panels inexplicably carrying a hammer. This, in conjunction with Jaime Hernandez' \\"Maggie and Hopey\\" tales, differentiated Love And Rockets from other comics in that the principal characters were all strong women who, whilst being independent, were also fallible. Through some twenty odd years Gilbert has taken the character of Luba through her infancy as the illegitimate child of a woman married into organized crime, through to life as a middle-aged migrant to America. Some of the Luba tales take place in Palomar where Gilbert developed a rich cast of residents, who over the years developed an intricate series of relations with each other. The bulk of the tales dealt with what happened after Luba and her family moved from Palomar to California to escape the mafia and be near her half sisters Fritz and Petra.

She served in the Pacific during World War II, and spent the rest of her Coast Guard career in the Great Lakes. She ran aground and was wrecked in December 1989 off the Keweenaw Peninsula in Lake Superior. She was scuttled nearby as a recreational diving attraction. == Construction and characteristics == Mesquite was built at the Marine Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company yard in Duluth, Minnesota. Her keel was laid down on August 20, 1942. The ship was launched on November 14, 1942. She was christened by Mrs. Jessie L. Tyler, wife of Lieutenant Commander Gaines A. Tyler, chief inspector for the Coast Guard at the Duluth shipyard. Her original cost was $874,798. Her hull was constructed of welded steel plates framed with steel I-beams. As originally built, Mesquite was long, with a beam of , and a draft of . Her displacement was 935 tons. While her overall dimensions remained the same over her career, the addition of new equipment raised her displacement to 1,025 tons by the end of her Coast Guard service. She was designed to perform light ice-breaking. Her hull was reinforced with an \\"ice belt\\" of thicker steel around her waterline to protect it from punctures. Similarly, her bow was reinforced and shaped to ride over ice in order to crush it with the weight of the ship. In 1968 Mesquite was fitted with an experimental \\"sea plow\\" called the \\"Alexbow\\" to enhance her icebreaking capabilities. This device was long, wide, and tall. It was attached by cables to the ship's bow which fit into a v-notch at the plow's stern. There were a number of problems with the experimental device and the design was not adopted by the Coast Guard. Mesquite had a single stainless- steel five-blade propeller driven by a diesel-electric propulsion system. Two Cooper-Bessemer GND-8 4-cycle 8-cylinder Diesel engines produced 700 horsepower each. They provided power to two Westinghouse generators. The electricity from the generators ran a 1200 horsepower Westinghouse electric motor which turned the propeller. She had a single cargo boom which had the ability to lift 20 tons onto her buoy deck. The ship's fuel tanks had a capacity of approximately . Mesquite's unrefueled range was at 13 knots, at 12 knots, and at 8.3 knots. Her potable water tanks had a capacity of . Considering dry storage capacity and other factors, her at-sea endurance was 21 days. Her wartime complement was 6 officers and 74 enlisted men. By 1964 this was reduced to 5 officers, 2 warrant officers, and 42 enlisted personnel. Mesquite was armed with a 3\\"/50 caliber gun mounted behind the pilot house. She also had two 20mm guns, one mounted on top of the wheelhouse and one on the aft deck. Two racks of depth charges were also mounted on the aft deck. All of this armament was removed when she returned to the Great Lakes in 1947. The Rush-Bagot Treaty with Canada had largely demilitarized the lakes leaving Mesquite with only small arms for law enforcement actions. At the time of construction, Mesquite was designated WAGL, an auxiliary vessel, lighthouse tender. The designation was system was changed in 1965, and she was redsignated WLB, an oceangoing buoy tender. Her namesake is the Mesquite tree of the southwest United States. == World War II service == leftUpon the completion of her fitting out and sea trials, Mesquite sailed from Duluth to the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland to have her armament and sensors installed. She was commissioned there on August 27, 1943. Her first, brief assignment was to the Coast Guard's 5th District, which was responsible for the mid-Atlantic coast. Within a month she was slated for service in the Pacific and began a series of training exercises to prepare. Mesquite sailed through the Panama Canal arriving at Brisbane, Australia on February 29, 1944. She reached Milne Bay in New Guinea on April 16, 1944. Mesquite was engaged in placing and maintaining aids to navigation in the Milne Bay Area for two months. On June 19, 1944 she arrived at Wakde Island less than a month after it was taken from the Japanese. She placed buoys in the area for two months and then moved on to Manus Island once again placing and maintaining buoys and other aids to navigation. By July 16, 1945 Mesquite was buoy tending in the Philippines. She spent the next year maintaining aids to navigation in the Philippines. She sailed back to the United States via Guam, and Hawaii, arriving at San Francisco on August 12, 1947. == Great Lakes service == After returning from the Pacific, Mesquite's first home port was Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, where she arrived on December 5, 1947. Her primary mission was maintaining aids to navigation. Much of her activity was driven by the annual advance and retreat of heavy winter ice on the Great Lakes. Buoys were brought to port in the fall to prevent them from being damaged, sunk, or set adrift by ice. Buoys were cleaned, repaired, and repainted over the winter and redeployed by the ship in the spring. Her second mission was icebreaking, a service she performed throughout her career. One aspect of her icebreaking work was to free ships that became trapped in the ice. In April 1960, for example, the tankers Edward G. Seubert and Clark Milwaukee became frozen-in on their way to Green Bay. Mesquite cut a track into the port, widened it, and then broke the ice near the immobilized ships to allow them to move into the broken track. The entire round trip from Green Bay, including breaking out the two tankers took nine hours. A second icebreaking role was to escort ships through the ice, breaking a channel for the ship following her. Mesquite was engaged on this task on April 18, 1958 when she led three Canada Steamship Lines ships through the ice in Whitefish Bay. A third icebreaking activity was to clear shipping lanes for future ship traffic. Mesquite cleared ice in the Straits of Mackinac, Lake Michigan, and the Saint Claire River. She also participated in \\"Operation Oil Can\\" over several winters. This program engaged several cutters in icebreaking channels for tankers transporting fuel to Great Lakes ports. Mesquite participated in numerous search and rescue missions. For example, in November 1956 the 7,300-ton freighter J.P. Wells lost her rudder in a storm with 30-foot seas. Mesquite steamed out into Lake Superior to render assistance. She was able to get lines across to the disabled ship twice, but both parted. She radioed for help and together with USCGC Mackinaw was able to tow J.P. Wells to Sault Ste. Marie for repairs. In 1963 Mesquite and a tug towed the grounded freighter Exiria off the rocks. She was laden with 500 tons of cheese embarked at Green Bay. In August of that year the ship rescued a family of five whose sailboat had been wrecked on an uninhabited island. In September of 1974, Mesquite rescued five people aboard a small powerboat that had been adrift for two days with engine problems and a dead battery. She not only rescued the passengers, but also craned the boat up on to the buoy deck before heading back to port. Mesquite was pressed into service as a fire-fighter several times in her career. Perhaps the most dramatic case occurred in January 1973. The port engine on the tanker Venus exploded and caught fire, killing one of her engineers. Mesquite went to the ship's aid and was able to extinguish the engine room fire in a matter of hours. She earned the Coast Guard Unit Commendation for this event. In 1959 Mesquite was assigned to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She replaced USCGC Hollyhock (WAGL-220) there. Her career at Sturgeon Bay was similar to that at Sault Ste. Marie with the seasonal removal and replacement of buoys, frequent calls for ice breaking over the winter, and the occasional vessel in distress. On April 10, 1964, though, it was Mesquite that needed a rescue. She was placing buoys at the beginning of spring, as she had for years. That year, however, Lake Michigan was at an unusually low level. At 11 am Mesquite went aground on Eleven-Foot Shoal in Green Bay and ripped a twelve-foot gash in her hull. The flooding reached five feet deep in her engine room and shut down the ship's engines and generators. The tug sent to pull her off the reef went aground, too, another victim of low water levels. Mesquite's crew placed a temporary patch on the hull to stop the flooding, so there was no danger of sinking. USCGC Sundew arrived on scene the next day and towed the tug off the reef. Then the two ships cooperated in towing Mesquite free. Mesquite went into dry dock at Sturgeon Bay for repairs. In 1972, USCGC Woodbine, based in Grand Haven, Michigan, was decommissioned. Mesquite was assigned responsibility for Woodbine's fleet of buoys. She also inherited some of Woodbine's equipment. In June 1976 she sailed for Portland, Maine. Mesquite's crew was transferred to the newly renovated USCGC Acacia at Curtis Bay. They sailed their new ship back to Sturgeon Bay where Acacia replaced Mesquite. Meanwhile, Mesquite went into the Coast Guard Yard for her own renovation. Her engines were overhauled and a bow thruster was added to improve the ship's maneuverability. alt=At the completion of the work in the fall of 1977, Mesquite was manned by the crew of USCGC Sundew, which was entering the Coast Guard Yard for her renovation cycle. They sailed the ship back to Sundew's old homeport, Charlevoix, Michigan. The juggling of ships and crews continued in 1978 as the Coast Guards buoy tender renovation program progressed. USCGC Woodrush was due for renovation, so her crew was swapped with Mesquite's. Mesquite sailed for Duluth to replace Woodrush. In June 1980 Mesquite was ordered back to Charlevoix, and traded crews with Sundew which was home-ported in Duluth. This was Mesquite's last change of home ports. In 1984, in cooperation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hatcheries and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Mesquite released 210,000 lake trout fingerlings on offshore reefs in Lake Michigan. It was hoped that fish released in the middle of the lake would have a higher survival rate than those released along the shore. In another cooperative venture, Mesquite set and retrieved weather buoys for NOAA. On November 26, 1984 Mesquite sailed from Charlevoix bound for Grenada. Operation Urgent Fury, the United States invasion of Grenada had been launched the previous month. She reached Grenada on December 25, 1984 via Halifax, Bermuda, and San Juan. Her primary mission was law enforcement patrols, but it became clear her services were not needed in Grenada. She headed back to Miami about February 1, 1985. She participated in a number of drug seizures and humanitarian missions while in Florida waters. She met USCGC Gallatin towing a fishing boat loaded with of marijuana, which she had seized. Mesquite took up the tow, and turned the contraband and the six-man crew over to law enforcement authorities in Miami. She returned to Charlevoix on April 7, 1985, just in time to begin her usual task of resetting buoys in the spring. The ship also deployed to Florida waters during the winter of 19881989 for law enforcement duties. She boarded twenty vessels while on patrol. She arrived back in Charlevoix on April 5, 1989, in time to replace her buoys. == Loss of Mesquite == Mesquite aground on her final voyage By the late 1980's the World War II-vintage buoy tender fleet on the Great Lakes had become mechanically unreliable. Coast Guard budget constraints sometimes slowed or deferred needed maintenance. It became common for ships to service not only their own fleet of buoys, but those of broken-down buoy tenders as well. At various times Mesquite was assigned to take care of buoys for Acacia, Bramble, and Sundew. Commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral Paul A. Yost, Jr. characterized this practice as \\"somewhat dangerous\\". Since buoys often mark shoals, rocks, and other hazards to navigation, tending buoys necessarily brings a cutter close to these dangers. When tending buoys assigned to a different cutter, the lack of previous experience can increase the risk. The higher risk became manifest in December 1989. Mesquite began her usual duties picking up her buoys before advancing ice could damage them. USCGC Sundew was late coming out of shipyard repairs, so Mesquite was once again tasked with removing some of her buoys as well. Mesquite picked up 25 of her buoys and headed to Lake Superior to pick up Sundew's. She retrieved at least 35 before she pulled the light buoy which marked the shoal off Keweenaw Point. With the buoy aboard, she got underway. At approximately 2:10 am on December 4, 1989 she ran onto the shoal and went aground. The hull was pierced, but the pumps were able to keep pace with the incoming water. Wind and waves were moderate, but enough to pound the ship on the rocks. After three hours, the flooding became uncontollable. The captain ordered Mesquite abandoned at 6:17 am and the crew was safely evacuated. Three suffered minor injuries. The crew was taken aboard a passing cargo vessel, Mangal Desai, which had responded to Mesquite's distress calls. USCGC Acacia, USCGC Katmai Bay, and CGC Samuel Risley responded to the scene. Up to of oil containment boom was deployed to capture a diesel fuel leak from Mesquite. High winds and waves up to battered the grounded ship on December 8 and 9, damaging the hull further, tearing off her rudder, and toppling her mast. The Coast Guard concluded at this point that the ship could not be salvaged in winter conditions. Instead, efforts were made to pump off the remaining fuel, salvage high value equipment, and seal the ship for the winter. On January 4, 1990 the Coast Guard announced the it would decommission Mesquite on January 31, 1990. Her damage was so great that it would not be worth attempting to restore her to service. The captain of Mesquite chose to stand for court- martial after the grounding, rather than resign. In September of 1990 he was found guilty of hazarding his vessel, but was acquitted of dereliction of duty. In January 1991, the appeal of his conviction was rejected. === Causes === Investigations subsequent to the loss of Mesquite identified a number of factors which may have contributed to the grounding. The crew of Mesquite had never tended this buoy before and thus was not familiar with the area. It was a dark, overcast night, eliminating any visual references. GPS was unavailable, LORAN was inaccurate, radar was insufficiently precise, other navigational aids in the area were unlit, and the chart of the area had an inappropriate scale. In short, it was difficult to tell precisely where the ship was in relation to the shoal. The bright lights on the buoy deck hurt the crews night vision. There was no lookout posted on the flying bridge who might have seen or heard waves breaking on the shoal. The officer of the deck failed to confirm the ship's location before getting underway and the captain failed to review the officer's work. Additional issues were identified as potentially preventing the ship from promptly refloating after the grounding. The ship was not aggressively lightened. Fifty tons of fresh water were not pumped overboard. She retained her anchors and chain as well as the 7 tons of buoys she had recovered. Only a limited attempt was made to back off the shoal and the bow thruster was not used. Some of the crew exhibited signs of panic. == Salvage and sinking == leftThe Coast Guard believed that storms and ice would break-up the stranded Mesquite, transforming her into an environmental and navigational hazard. It determined to remove her during the summer of 1990 while the ship was mostly intact. There were three options considered for the hulk after it was removed from the shoal. First, it could be scrapped. Second, it could be repaired and returned to service, but at an estimated cost of $44 million, this option was quickly discarded. Third, it could be scuttled not far from the grounding and become a recreational diving attraction. There were several issues with the diving proposal, all of which revolved around liability. There were concerns that fuel, oil, or other toxic substances would leak from the wreck. There were concerns that lawsuits might result from divers injured on the wreck. The Keweenaw Bay Indian Community was concerned that the wreck would interfere with fish spawning. The Coast Guard was not willing to shoulder this liability, as recreational diving sites are not part of its mission. Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner, who supervised the Coast Guard, offered to donate the wreck to the State of Michigan in April 1990, but the state had its own concerns about liability. An agreement was struck in early May 1990 and Mesquite was donated to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources for the proposed Keweenaw Underwater Preserve as an attraction for recreational divers. alt=After the storm of December 8 and 9, 1989, salvors concluded that she could not be patched, pumped out, and refloated. The wreck would have to be lifted off the shoal and carried to her sinking site. To achieve this lift, a barge was chartered and a pair of lowering trusses originally used by Shell Oil for platform construction at its COGNAC oil field in the Gulf of Mexico were mounted on it. The heavy-lift barge was towed from Port Newark, New Jersey to Lake Superior during May 1990. In preparation for scuttling, salvors stripped Mesquite of valuable parts, including the propeller, cargo boom, and anchor windlass which the Coast Guard wanted for its stores. Much loose material was hauled off. Most of the superstructure was cut away. Remaining fuel, oil, paint, and other toxic material was removed. Flooded compartments of the ship were either pumped out or blown out with compressed air to reduce the wreck's weight. Finally, on July 14, 1990 Mesquite was lifted off its ledge. When her full weight was carried by the trusses, the heavy-lift barge had less than of clearance to the bottom of the lake. After Mesquite was off the bottom, the wreck and barge were winched out of the shallow water. Once clear of the shoal, they were towed to the sinking site about away in Keystone Bay. The wreck was lowered to the bottom in of water. The total cost of the removal process was approximately $2 million. == Legacy == The Coast Guard reassigned Acacia to Charlevoix, Michigan to replace Mesquite. There was no replacement cutter for Acacia, however, reducing the number of buoy tenders in the Great Lakes from five to four. The Coast Guard justified the move based on cost savings, but others attributed it to the influence of U.S. Representative Bob Davis, who represented Charlevoix in Congress. He was vice-chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee which had jurisdiction over the Coast Guard. The move left ill-feeling in Grand Haven, Acacia's previous base. The Keweenaw Underwater Preserve was created and Mesquite became one of its most popular attractions for recreational divers. Not all were respectful, and the ship was stripped of many artifacts shortly after she was scuttled. Artifacts from the Mesquite are on display at the Maritime Museum at Eagle Harbor Lighthouse in Eagle Harbor Michigan. ==References== Category:Mesquite-class seagoing buoy tenders Category:1942 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1989 Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior Category:Ships of the United States Coast Guard ","title":"USCGC Mesquite (WLB-305)"},{"id":"1432747","text":"Archaeoglobaceae are a family of the Archaeoglobales.See the NCBI webpage on Archaeoglobaceae.

Archaeoglobaceae are the only family in the order Archaeoglobales, which is the only order in the class Archaeoglobi. == Mode of metabolism == While all genera within the Archaeoglobaceae are related to each other phylogenetically, the mode of metabolism used by each of these organisms is unique. Archaeoglobus are chemoorganotrophic sulfate-reducing archaea, the only known member of the Archaea that possesses this type of metabolism.

Data extracted from the Archaeoglobus can be found in high- temperature oil fields where they may contribute to oil field souring. == Metabolism == Archaeoglobus grow anaerobically at extremely high temperatures between 60 and 95 ¬∞C, with optimal growth at 83 ¬∞C (ssp. A. fulgidus VC-16). They are sulfate-reducing archaea, coupling the reduction of sulfate to sulfide with the oxidation of many different organic carbon sources, including complex polymers. A. lithotrophicus live chemolitho-autotrophically from hydrogen, sulfate and carbon dioxide. Also A. profundus grow lithotrophically, but while this species needs acetate and CO2 for biosynthesis they are heterotroph.J. Vorholt et al. Enzymes and coenzymes of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase pathway for autotrophic CO2 fixation in Archaeoglobus lithotrophicus and the lack of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase in the heterotrophic A. profundus Arch. Microbiol. 163, 112‚Äì118 (1995). The complete A. fulgidus genome sequence revealed the presence of a nearly complete set of genes for methanogenesis. The function of these genes in A. fulgidus remains unknown, while the lack of the enzyme methyl-CoM reductase does not allow for methanogenesis to occur by a mechanism similar to that found in other methanogens. == Description and significance == Archaeoglobus members are hyperthermophiles that can be found in hydrothermal vents, oil deposits, and hot springs. They can produce biofilm when subjected to environmental stresses such as extreme pH or temperature, high concentrations of metal, or the addition of antibiotics, xenobiotics, or oxygen. These archaeons are known to cause the corrosion of iron and steel in oil and gas processing systems by producing iron sulphide. Their biofilms, however, may have industrial or research applications in the form of detoxifying metal contaminated samples or to gather metals in an economically recoverable form. == Genome structure == The Archaeoglobus fulgidus genome is a circular chromosome roughly half the size of E. coli at 2,178,000 base pairs. A quarter of the genome encodes preserved proteins whose functions are not yet determined, but are expressed in other archaeons such as Methanococcus jannaschii. Another quarter encodes proteins unique to the archaeal domain. One observation about the genome is that there are many gene duplications and the duplicated proteins are not identical. This suggests metabolic differentiation specifically with respect to the decomposing and recycling carbon pathways through scavenged fatty acids. The duplicated genes also gives the genome a larger genome size than its fellow archaeon M. jannaschii. It is also noted that Archaeoglobus contained no inteins in coding regions where M. jannaschii had 18. ==Molecular signatures showing relatedness to methanogens and Thermococci== Comparative genomic studies on archaeal genomes provide evidence that members of the genus Archaeoglobus are the closest relatives of methanogenic archaea. This is supported by the presence of 10 conserved signature proteins that are uniquely found in all methanogens and Archaeoglobus. Additionally, 18 proteins which are uniquely found in members of Thermococci, Archaeoglobus and methanogens have been identified, suggesting that these three groups of Archaea may have shared a common relative exclusive of other Archaea. However, the possibility that the shared presence of these signature proteins in these archaeal lineages is due to lateral gene transfer cannot be excluded.Gao, B. and Gupta, R. S. (2007). Phylogenomic analysis of proteins that are distinctive of Archaea and its main subgroups and the origin of methanogenesis. BMC Genomics. 8:86. doi:10.1186/1471-2164-8-86. == Ecology == Archaeoglobus species utilize their environment by acting as scavengers with many potential carbon sources. They can obtain carbon from fatty acids, the degradation of amino acids, aldehydes, organic acids, and possibly CO as well. Higher temperatures (approx. 83 ¬∞C) are ideal growth temperatures for Archaeoglobus, although a biofilm environment provides some environmental elasticity. Biofilm is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, and metals. == Medicine == Cells protected by biofilm are difficult to destroy using conventional anti- microbial therapy, which gives them medicinal possibilities.Klenk et al.

After seven years as a clerk in the London bank of Marsh, Sibbald & Co., of which his father was one of the founders, he was taken into partnership, and the whole business of the firm was left in his hands. In 1824, the bank suspended payment. Fauntleroy was arrested on the charge of appropriating trust funds by forging the trustees' signatures, and was committed for trial, it being freely rumoured that he had appropriated ¬£250,000, which he had squandered in debauchery. He was tried at the Old Bailey, and, the case against him having been proved, he admitted his guilt, but pleaded that he had used the misappropriated funds to pay his firm's debts. He was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. Seventeen merchants and bankers gave evidence as to his general integrity at the trial. After his conviction, powerful influence was brought to bear on his behalf, and his case was twice argued before judges on points of law. An Italian named Angelini even offered to take Fauntleroy's place on the scaffold. The efforts of his many friends were, however, unavailing, and he was hanged in November 1824, one of the last few to be executed for forgery before it ceased to be a capital crime in 1836. This outcome was in contrast to that of the fraudster Lancelot Cooper who was compared to Fauntleroy by The Times in 1827. He was also condemned to death but subsequently had his sentence commuted to transportation (probably due to the influence of John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare). A wholly unfounded rumour was widely credited for some time subsequently, to the effect that he had escaped strangulation by inserting a silver tube in his throat, and was living comfortably abroad. Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Blithedale Romance includes a minor background character called Fauntleroy, a banker. Henry Fauntleroy is a major character in Susan Grossey's novel Fatal Forgery. Samuel Warren recalled witnessing Fauntleroy's hanging in the section of his Miscellanies entitled 'My First Circuit'. == References == * Griffiths Chronicles of Newgate, ii. 294-300 * Pierce Egan, Account of the Trial of Mr Fauntleroy, 1824 * * Marsh family history website jjhc.info Category:1784 births Category:1824 deaths Category:Businesspeople from London Category:English bankers Category:English criminals Category:Executed people from London Category:People executed for forgery Category:19th-century executions by England and Wales Category:1820s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1824 crimes ","title":"Henry Fauntleroy"},{"id":"1432752","text":"The New Capitalist Party was a short-lived political party in Canada that nominated three candidates in Toronto-area ridings in the 1965 federal election.

Until the end of their physical retail presence in 2019 it was best known for its brick and mortar LifeWay Christian Stores, one of the two major American retailers of Christian books and products (the other being Mardel Christian & Education). Lifeway produces multiple curriculums and bible studies used in Sunday schools and other church functions. Lifeway publishes the Christian Standard Bible (the successor to the Holman Christian Standard Bible) as well as Christian books and commentaries through B&H; Publishing. Lifeway operates a research division that studies Protestant trends and provides contract research services. In addition they distribute many Christian resources created by outside parties. They distribute and sell many church products such as communion supplies, upholstery etc. through its e-commerce business. Lifeway also provides a multitude of church business services such as website design, architecture, background checks, capital campaigns, pastoral coaching and others through both in-house services and partnerships with outside firms. While Lifeway is a non-profit and part of the Southern Baptist Convention, they receive no church funding through the cooperative program. Instead, Lifeway is self-funded through the sales of their products. Lifeway previously operated World Changers until it was shut down in 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. In April 2020 Lifeway board voted to put the RidgeCrest Conference Center up for sale. ==History== In 1891 James Marion Frost, a 43-year-old pastor, founded ‚ÄúThe Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention\\" after that year's annual meeting in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1925, the Board began operating retail bookstores under the name \\"Baptist Book Store\\". According to Jeffrey Gros, the Sunday School Board was \\"one of the principal sources of literacy across the South.\\" Around 1971 the Board began using the \\"LifeWay\\" imprint on some of its materials and as the name for retail stores in certain markets, reflecting an expansion of items sold which included items produced by others (some of whom were not Southern Baptist). Over a two-year period from 1996 to 1998 the Board re-branded its stores under the LifeWay banner and officially changed its name. In 2017 LifeWay staff moved out of the Draper Tower and the Sullivan Tower into new headquarters in the Capitol View (Nashville) area. In January 2019 LifeWay announced it would cut staff and close some of its 170 stores; however, two months later it announced that it would be closing all of them and shift its focus to the e-commerce side of the business. == Divisions == === Church Ministries === === Publishing === ==== B&H; Publishing ==== B&H; is the primary publishing of Lifeway Christian Resources. B&H; was formerly named Broadman and Holman publishers, before being shortened to B&H.; In 1993, the Holman Bible Company was acquired by Broadman Press. B&H; currently publishes under several imprints including flagship B&H; Books (also called B&H; Publishing), B&H; Academic, B&H; Kids, B&H; Espa√±ol and Holman Bible Publishers. The CSB Bible as well as several commentaries are published under Holman Bible Publishers. B&H; Academic develops textbooks, educational resources and market-oriented works of biblical scholars, theologians and Christian academics. === Church Resources === === Lifeway Research === Lifeway Research is the research division of Lifeway, conducting polls on trends with Protestantism and Evangelicalism in North America. Lifeway partners with Outreach Magazine to produce the Outreach 100- a report publicizing the 100 largest churches by attendance and by growth in the United States. Lifeway Research conducts a variety of polls on surveys on topics such as church attendance, church member's behaviors, public opinion on social issues, pastoral trends and other issues of pertinence to Christianity's influence in North America. They publish their research findings through their website and through collaboration with multiple partners. They also publish Facts and Trends, a publication highlighting research specifically targeted towards pastors and ministry leaders. Additionally, they publish several books, podcasts and other resources disseminating their research finds. Lifeway Research offers custom research services for churches, parachurch organizations and ministries. Lifeway Research has also developed several assessments used by Southern Baptist churches among others, designed to assess church member's spiritual growth, potential church revitalization efforts and church planting. === Former Divisions === ==== World Changers ==== World Changers was an organization that was an entity of LifeWay Student Ministries. It provides national youth work projects. During projects, students typically spend one week repairing damaged homes. The missions agency for World Changers was the North American Mission Board until 2011 when LifeWay took over. In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic World Changers ceased operations The organization's first service projects began in the summer of 1990. The host- city of the first project was Briceville, TN. In 1992, World Changers expanded abroad with a project in Ciudad Victoria, Mexico.World Changers History. Retrieved on 2009-01-03 For each project, youth and adults provide labor at their own expense for substandard homes. All participants are divided into crews for the week. At each work site crews usually paint, reroof, or perform other light construction jobs. In January 2011, high school and college students volunteers of World Changers returned to Rock Hill, South Carolina to continue to help substantially by improving homes in need throughout the city. World Changers is planning to recruit as many as 350 volunteers and help as many as 33 homes in Rock Hill this year.Worthington, Don. \\"Why wait for TV crews to help those in need?.\\" Herald Online 01/27/2011: n. pag.

It will not sell, and will if needed discontinue selling, works by authors who disagree with its policies. As an example, in October 2016 it pulled all works by author Jen Hatmaker after she endorsed same-sex marriage. LifeWay's ministry on the subject of sexuality and gender expression categorizes non- normative identities as sinful lifestyles, the threat of which requires church members be \\"ready when homosexuality devastates.\\" This is generally consistent with Article XVIII of the Baptist Faith & Message (the doctrinal statement of the Southern Baptist Convention, LifeWay's parent), though it does not specifically address gender expression topics such as transgender or non- binary genders.http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfm2000.asp Baptist Faith and Message ==Leadership== In February 2006, Thom Rainer became the president and CEO of LifeWay after having served as dean of the Billy Graham School of Evangelism of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.

He managed Southport in the 2017‚Äì18 season, before his contract was terminated on 30 April 2018. Davies originally made his name as a vital part of the Chesterfield team which reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1997. He left Chesterfield at the end of that season, having made 148 appearances for the club and joined Premier League club Southampton in May 1997. He only spent one season at Southampton, making 30 appearances, before he joined Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in a club-record ¬£7.5 million deal. Once again, he spent a single season at the club, making 29 appearances, before rejoining Southampton in 1999. In his second spell at the club, he made 95 appearances, also spending part of 2002 on loan to First Division club Millwall, where he made nine appearances. Released by Southampton at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, he joined Premier League club Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer. He was made Bolton team captain in January 2009, but began to fall out of favour at Bolton towards the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, and the club decided against renewing his contract. Davies made 407 appearances for Bolton, scoring 85 goals, then played two seasons at Preston North End before retiring. He made three appearances for the England under-21 team between 1997 and 2000. At the age of 33, Davies made his international debut, and only appearance, for England against Montenegro in a 0‚Äì0 draw on 12 October 2010, coming on as a second-half substitute. ==Club career== ===Chesterfield=== Born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, Davies played as a schoolboy with his boyhood club Sheffield United, but was released at the age of 15. He was taken on trial at Chesterfield and served his traineeship with the club. Davies broke into the club's first team after several months. He became Chesterfield's second youngest ever first-team player when he appeared against West Ham United in a League Cup tie, aged only 16, on 22 September 1993. He signed his first professional contract with the club in April 1994. Generally, Davies' goalscoring form at Chesterfield was unspectacular, playing mostly wide in midfield and scoring his best total of 11 goals in the 1994‚Äì95 promotion season from the Third Division via the play- offs. In his final season at Saltergate he managed a mere three goals from 34 Second Division matches but made a major contribution to the Spireites' best- ever FA Cup run, including a hat-trick at Burnden Park in a fourth round tie against Bolton Wanderers and an earlier strike against Scarborough in the 2nd round. Despite his relative lack of goals, his skilful play was still attracting attention from Premier League and First Division clubs during his contribution to Chesterfield's FA Cup exploits, which culminated in a semi- final replay defeat against Middlesbrough. As a youngster, Davies was far from the aggressive centre-forward he subsequently became at Bolton. At Chesterfield, although very well-built and strong for a teenager, he was known for his skill and intelligence, and it was these qualities that attracted the attention of Southampton manager Graeme Souness. ===Southampton=== Davies moved to Southampton in May 1997 and, in his first spell with them, scored nine league goals, one of which was a notable solo goal in a 2‚Äì0 win against Everton at Goodison Park. He also scored the lone goals in historic 1‚Äì0 wins against Manchester United and Chelsea, and the equaliser in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Liverpool. ===Blackburn Rovers=== Blackburn Rovers signed him for ¬£7.5 million in July 1998, ten times what Southampton had paid for him a year earlier and also a club record. Chesterfield received no more money from the switch, having failed to negotiate a sell-on clause. As part of the deal, James Beattie went the other way. However, Davies scored just one league goal, the winner in a victory over Charlton Athletic, in 21 appearances for the club. He scored a further goal in the FA Cup, also against Charlton Athletic, and played a UEFA Cup match that season. At the end of the campaign, Blackburn were relegated a year after finishing sixth in the league and a mere four years after winning the league. ===Return to Southampton=== Southampton re- signed their former striker in exchange for Egil √òstenstad in August 1999. However, just two league matches into his return at Southampton, Davies found himself sent off in a defeat against Liverpool after coming on as a substitute for Mark Hughes. He struggled to gain a first-team place throughout the next four years, and was more often than not a substitute. For the 2002‚Äì03 season Davies went on loan to Milwall in the First Division, where he played nine times, scoring three goals. ===Bolton Wanderers=== Davies lining up for Bolton Wanderers in 2008 In summer 2003, he joined Bolton having been released by Southampton. In a season where he rediscovered his best form, he scored ten times and started every league match. He ended the season by winning the club's Player of the Year award and scored a consolation goal for his team in the 2004 League Cup Final against Middlesbrough at the Millennium Stadium. Davies is frequently cited as being the player in the Premier League that commits the most fouls, committing more offences than any other Premier League player in for three consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2007. In the 2003‚Äì04 and 2007‚Äì08 seasons, Davies was slightly better behaved, committing the second highest number of fouls per season. In his Bolton career Davies has committed over 1,000 fouls, more than any other Premier League player in the competition's history.FOOTBALL: TODAY'S TOP 20: HIGHEST FOULS PER GAME RATIO SO FAR THIS  Independent, The (London)  Find Articles at BNET.com At the same time Davies has also featured near the top of the list of most fouled players. During a post-match interview with the BBC after a match against Arsenal in January 2009, during which he had been accused of deliberately trying to injure Ga√´l Clichy in a challenge, he replied that some Arsenal players tried to \\"con the referee\\". He added \\"A few of them let out a big scream, which is a bit embarrassing because it is a man's game ... in my eyes that is cheating the referee ... you just have to get on with the game.\\" On 10 September 2011. he received his 100th yellow card in the Premier League for a foul on Manchester United's Patrice Evra and when he received another booking against Wigan Athletic on 11 February 2012, he became the joint holder of the record for most yellow cards in Premier League history, alongside Lee Bowyer. Paul Scholes has equaled his Premier League yellow card record and Gareth Barry has surpassed this record. On 8 November 2007, Davies scored a goal away to Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. Davies's late effort earned Bolton a crucial away point from the 2‚Äì2 draw in the UEFA Cup group stage. On 12 April 2008, Davies scored his 100th career goal in a 1‚Äì0 win over West Ham at the Reebok Stadium, despite dislocating a finger during the match and having it placed back into its socket allowing him to play on. On Saturday 3 May 2008, he made his return from a broken hand to help Bolton retain their Premier League status. Over the summer of 2008, Hull City tried to sign Kevin Davies from Bolton, but the club turned down their offer.Bolton News ignore Kevin Davies to Hull story . Manny Road. 1 August 2008. Davies then signed a new contract with Bolton would keep him at the club until 2011.Bolton's Kevin Davies signs lucrative new contract. Daily Mirror. London. 29 August 2008. On 31 January 2009, Davies became captain of Bolton following the sale of Kevin Nolan to Newcastle United. The same day, Davies' first match as captain saw him score two goals in Bolton's 3‚Äì2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur as well as equalling his record for goals in a Premier League season. In the following match, at home against West Ham, he scored his 50th goal for Bolton, and his 10th of the season. In August 2009, Davies stated that he would like to stay at Bolton for the rest of his career. On 13 March 2010, Davies scored the first penalty of his career, netting the second from the spot in a 4‚Äì0 home win over Wigan. Davies set a Premier League records for the most fouls in a season in 2009‚Äì10, committing 120 such offences. In the 2010‚Äì11 season he went on to break his own record with 121 fouls. Davies was relegated with Bolton at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, but shortly after, he signed a new one-year deal with the club and assured the fans he would stay to get Bolton back to the Premier League. He made his 400th appearance for the club at Watford on 2 February 2013. On 26 March 2013, Bolton announced that they would not be offering Davies a new contract, which would make that season his final for the club. Following this announcement, Davies played no further matches that season, being initially dropped to the bench before eventually being left out of match day squads completely, with reserve-team strikers being preferred instead. ===Preston North End=== On 10 July 2013, Davies signed a two-year contract with League One club Preston North End. He made his league debut for Preston on 3 August in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers, and drew praise from his manager for his performance. His first goal for Preston was a penalty in a 2‚Äì1 win over Oldham Athletic on 9 September 2013. He went on to score the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win over Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup on 9 December 2013. On 7 February 2015, he scored his 150th career goal and his first of the season, heading in Paul Gallagher's cross to win a home match against Coventry City. He played 22 minutes as a substitute for hat-trick scorer Jermaine Beckford on 24 May as Preston won 4‚Äì0 in the play-off final against Swindon Town at Wembley Stadium. On 4 September 2015, Davies announced his retirement from football after 22 years in the game. ==International career== Davies was asked near the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season if he was eligible to play for Scotland. Davies is, to his own knowledge, ineligible to represent Scotland, but further explained he would reject any call-up to the Scottish or Welsh teams even if it was possible. At the age of 33, Davies was called up to the England squad for the first time in his career for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Montenegro on 12 October 2010. He made his debut as a 69th-minute substitute for Peter Crouch and received a yellow card. At 33 years and 200 days, he became the oldest England debutant since the 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.BBC Sport \\"Kevin Davies: Ex-Preston, Bolton and England striker retires\\" ==Style of play== Davies was known for his bustling, physical playing style; he has committed more fouls than any other player in the history of the Premier League, although conversely he is also one of the most fouled. He was more of a \\"goal architect\\" than a goalscorer. ==Managerial career== Davies was appointed manager of National League North club Southport on 18 October 2017 on a two-and-a-half-year contract. On 30 April 2018 Southport announced that Davies had been released from his managerial duties. ==Personal life== He is the half brother of fellow footballer Jamie Jackson.

Their sound was difficult to categorize in that it encompassed tortured lovelorn balladry, avant-garde flourishes, Tin Pan Alley, straightforward rock and gospel yearnings in both lyrics and subject matter. Ultimately, Dream City Film Club failed to find enough of an audience to sustain them. Vocalist Michael J. Sheehy had been working as a solo singer/songwriter for several years when he met Alex Vald and Laurence Ash, who quickly began writing songs with Sheehy. Upon the demise of another local group, Breed, bassist Andrew Park joined. The band's name came from a news story Sheehy had seen about an arsonist who had burned down a members-only porno theatre. They played their first gig as Dream City Film Club on 31 July 1995. They released a single, \\"Crawl\\" for the underground fanzine, the Organ in early 1996. Soon after, they were contacted by Beggar's Banquet and recorded their eponymous debut album in late 1996, later releasing it on 26 May 1997. According to Sheehy, the English press reaction to the first single, \\"Perfect Piece of Trash\\", was almost unanimous in its derision. After parting with Vald, DCFC continued on as a three piece, recording its second and final album, In the Cold Light of Morning featuring a more expansive sound best realized on the epic \\"God Will Punish the Pervert Preacher\\". The group disbanded in 1999. Michael J. Sheehy subsequently recorded three solo albums for Beggar's Banquet and two for Glitterhouse, and has fronted Saint Silas Intercession with his brother Patrick.

He has enjoyed a more lasting reputation as the prototype, in some part, of Shakespeare's character Sir John Falstaff. Many historians argue, however, that he deserves to be famous in his own right, not only as a soldier, but as a patron of literature, a writer on strategy and perhaps as an early industrialist. == Lineage and family == Coming from a minor gentry family in Norfolk, John Fastolf was born on 6 November 1380 at the manor house of Caister Hall, a family possession which he later turned into Caister Castle, but of which little now remains aside from the water-filled moat. The son of Sir John Fastolf (died 1383) and Mary Park (died 2 May 1406), he belonged to an ancient Norfolk family originally seated at Great Yarmouth, where it is recorded from the thirteenth century. Notable members of the family in earlier generations included Thomas Fastolf, Bishop of St David's, and his brother, Nicholas Fastolf, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Many of the name had been bailiffs of Great Yarmouth since the time of Edward I, and a certain Hugh Fastolf was sheriff of Norfolk in 1390. On 13 January 1409, in Ireland, Fastolf married Millicent Tibetot (1368‚Äì1446), daughter and co-heiress of Robert, Lord Tiptoft, and widow of Sir Stephen Scrope (son of Richard, Lord Scrope). This marriage brought him significant amounts of land, including the manors of Castle Combe and Bathampton in Wiltshire, Oxenton in Gloucestershire, and several properties in Somerset and Yorkshire. These lands brought him an income of ¬£240 per annum, a considerable sum which amounted to five times the revenue Fastolf gained from his own estates. He settled an amount of ¬£100 a year on his wife for her own use, but otherwise held her estates for himself until his death, at the expense of Millicent's son by her first marriage, Stephen Scrope (Fastolf's stepson). Fastolf's wife was significantly older than him, and the couple had no children. ==Early years== According to Fastolf's biographer Stephen Cooper, given his family's background Fastolf must have received an appropriate education for the standards of the time. In a court testimony given in France, 1435, he claimed to have visited Jerusalem as a boy, between 1392 and 1393, which must have been in the company of Henry Bolingbroke, later Henry IV. Fastolf is said to have been squire to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, before the latter was banished in 1398. Fastolf's whereabouts during the Lancastrian coup of 1399 (when Henry IV seized the crown from Richard II) are unknown, but in 1401 he entered the retinue of King Henry IV's second son, Thomas of Lancaster (later Duke of Clarence), under whose service he would remain until 1415. Thomas had been appointed by his father to keep order in Ireland, and it was here that Fastolf first saw military action. Fastolf's commanding officer was Sir Stephen Scrope, whose widow he married after his death in 1408. == Hundred Years' War == ===Early service in France === From 1415 to 1439, he was in northern France, where he served under Henry V and the king's brother, the Duke of Bedford. He took part in the siege of Harfleur in 1415, but was invalided home and so missed Agincourt, though he returned to defend Harfleur against the French attempt to recapture it in the winter of 1415‚Äì1416. He was Bedford's Master of the Household, and was Governor of the province of Maine and Anjou, and on 25 February 1426, created a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. Later in this year he was superseded in his command by John Talbot; and he became a somewhat controversial figure after the Siege of Orl√©ans. In 1421, during the English occupation of Paris, he became \\"governor\\" (effectively, the warden) of the Bastille, probably for a year. After a visit to England in 1428, he returned to the war, and on 12 February 1429, when in charge of the convoy for the English army before Orl√©ans defeated the French and Scots at the Battle of the Herrings. In his biography of Fastolf The Real Falstaff (2010), Stephen Cooper re-locates this battle from Rouvray-Saint-Denis to Rouvray-Sainte-Croix. ===Encounters with Joan of Arc=== During the 1429 Siege of Orl√©ans, the French had planned to abandon the city after they heard rumours (which were true) that John Fastolf was coming with a force to reinforce the English besiegers. Jean de Dunois (known as \\"The Bastard of Orl√©ans\\" as he was the illegitimate son of Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans) decided not to tell Joan of Arc and leave her out of leadership decisions, to which she famously responded: The French leader conceded to her, and she successfully lifted the siege. She went on to take towns in the Loire Valley, including Jargeau on 12 June 1429, even though Fastolf had attempted to reinforce with troops and gunpowder weapons. After a result of this string of unexpected sudden defeats, Talbot and Fastolf resolved to confront the French in battle to put an end to their success, thus leading to the Battle of Patay on 18 June 1429. Joan was leading this army and was present in the battle, although how much of a role she had in it is disputed. ===The Battle of Patay and Fastolf's reputation=== Patay was a serious defeat for the English. 200‚Äì300 men were killed and over 2000 captured, including Talbot. Fastolf had, however, escaped. According to the French historian Jehan de Waurin, who was present, the disaster was due to Talbot's rashness, and Fastolf only fled when resistance was hopeless. Other accounts charge him with cowardice, and it is true that John, Duke of Bedford suspended him from the Order of the Garter and he was subject of accusations of cowardice from Talbot. Eventually, in 1442, an inquiry was convened by the Order of the Garter, probably at Fastolf's insistence. This found in Fastolf's favour and he was honourably reinstated to the order. This incident was unfavourably depicted by Shakespeare in Henry VI, Part 1 (act IV scene I). In all, it took Fastolf thirteen years to clear his name and even then, his reputation was still tainted. === Later career === Fastolf continued to serve with honour in France, and was trusted both by Bedford and by Richard of York. Despite the scandal associated with the Patay incident, he held a number of military commands, including captaincies of Honfleur (1424‚Äì34), Verneuil (1429), and Caen (1430‚Äì37). In 1435, he drafted a document variously referred to as a report or memorandum proposing a new strategic approach to the war in France. In it, he criticizes current policy based on a war of sieges and proposes instead an offensive strategy based on large scale chevauch√©es. The document is a rare surviving example of military strategic thinking by a professional soldier of the Middle Ages. He only came home finally in 1440, when past sixty years of age. But the scandal against him continued, and during Cade's rebellion in 1450 he was charged by the rebels with having been the cause of the English disasters through \\"diminishing the garrisons of Normandy\\". == Property and investments == Fastolf, like other English soldiers, profited from the wars in France by obtaining lands in the conquered territories. He was given Frileuse near Harfleur by Henry V and went on to build a considerable property portfolio in Normandy, including four manors in the Pays de Caux worth ¬£200 per annum. Later, he became the Baron of Sill√©-le-Guillaume and therefore a member of the peerage there, a position he never attained at home. But the instability of English rule cost him much in lost revenues. His Pays de Caux manors had an income of only ¬£8 after the Norman revolt of 1435. He began in the 1430s to sell off his properties but he still in 1445 held properties in France worth ¬£401, including 10 castles, 15 manors and an inn. All this was lost in the French reconquest. == \\"Cruel and vengible he hath been ever‚Ä¶\\" == In the 1950s the Oxford academic K. B. McFarlane showed that Fastolf made large sums of money in France, which he managed to transfer back to England and invest in land and property. At the time, his reputation was mixed. One servant wrote of him: \\"cruel and vengible he hath been ever, and for the most part without pity and mercy\\" (Paston Letters, i. 389); and this remark has become famous because it was recorded in the letter. Besides his share in his wife's property he had large estates in Norfolk and Suffolk, a house at Southwark in London and where he also owned the Boar's Head Inn. The site of his house at Southwark, known as Fastolf Place or Palace, was excavated in the 1990s, but only a few pieces of revetment were found. From 1435, and more so in retirement, he was the author of numerous memoranda, which he fired off to the government of the day, about the strategy and policy to be pursued with regard to the war in France. These were preserved by his secretary William Worcester and eventually published by the Reverend Joseph Stevenson in the nineteenth century. He also sat at the centre of an important literary circle, which produced manuscripts in French and English for him. His last years were troubled by litigation and disputes regarding his East Anglian estates, in which he was helped by both John Paston, to whom he was related through Paston's wife, Margaret, and Sir William Yelverton, and by factional fighting at court which ultimately led to the so-called Wars of the Roses. Paston and Yelverton would go on to be two of the main protagonists in the battles over his property after his death. Fastolf was inclined to sympathise with Richard, Duke of York, whom he had known and served in France, but it would be an exaggeration to say that he ever became a 'Yorkist'. He was a widower throughout the last decade of his life, when he lived at Southwark and Caister, and he had no heir. He seems to have been a somewhat lonely figure, and made several attempts to draft a will, establishing a Chantry College at Caister Castle. == Death and burial == He died at Caister on 5 November 1459. He was buried next to his wife Millicent in St Benet's Abbey in an aisle specially built at his expense on the south side of the abbey church, of which he had been a generous benefactor. During the last decade of his life he was a close political ally and friend of John Paston, who came to fame through the Paston Letters, a collection of over 1,000 items of correspondence between members of the Paston family. Fastolf's deathbed testament naming John Paston as his executor and heir led to many years of litigation. The ruins of St Benet's Abbey may still be visited, as may the ruins of Caister Castle. The Castle never became home to a chantry, as Fastolf intended. Instead, it passed to the Paston family. The bulk of Sir John's fortune passed to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he is remembered as a benefactor, and where there is a Fastolf Society. ==Cultural portrayals== ===Shakespeare=== Fastolf appears in Shakespeare's early play Henry VI, part 1 as a cowardly knight who abandons the heroic Lord Talbot. In the first two folios the name of the character is given as 'Falstaffe' not Fastolf. When Shakespeare came to write Henry IV, part 1, set in the early years of Fastolf's career, he created a disreputable boon companion for the young Prince Hal called Sir John Oldcastle. The descendants of the real Oldcastle complained, so the name was changed to Sir John Falstaff, under which name he is identified in three later plays. The tradition of Fastolf's braggart cowardice may have suggested the use of his name. Some writers have also suggested that Fastolf favoured Lollardy, which was also associated with Oldcastle, so this circumstance may have aided the adoption of the name. Stephen Cooper considers that there is in fact no evidence that Fastolf was a Lollard, and substantial indications that he was in fact Catholic like his one-time master Henry V. Other points of resemblance between the historic Fastolf and the Falstaff of the dramatist are to be found in their service under Thomas Mowbray, and association with a Boar's Head Inn. But Falstaff is in no true sense a dramatisation of the real soldier, more an amalgam of a few real personages with a dash of creative licence. Indeed, the aged Falstaff dies early in the reign of Henry V, when Fastolf was midway through his career. ===Later portrayals=== Fastolf appears as a featured character in Koei's video game known as Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War, in which he is seen as a contributor to the cause of England, wielding a longsword as his primary weapon. He is the subject of a novel by Robert Nye entitled Falstaff (Publisher: Allison & Busby; New Ed edition (1 Oct 2001)) Fastolf is also an opponent in Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, in the game's Joan of Arc campaign. Fastolf fights on England's side and his unit is a lance-wielding knight. Most recently he appears under his Shakespearian surname Falstaff in the 2019 Netflix film The King, acting as both the young Prince Henry's companion in tavern debaucheries and later the battle-seasoned veteran responsible for strategizing Henry V's victory at Agincourt. ==Footnotes== ==References== == Further reading == * . * . * . * * . * , enlarged by Gough in Kippis's edition. ** * . * * .

He attended the Kursk Gymnasium (secondary school). He entered the medical faculty of Kharkov University in 1893 and transferred to Moscow University in 1895, where he graduated with distinction in 1898. He was appointed resident intern to professor Alexander Bobrov at the surgical clinic of Moscow university. Korotkov was given leave of absence to serve with the Russian military forces in the Far East during the Boxer Rebellion in China 1900. He was attached to the Red Cross in the Iversh Community under Dr Aleksinskii (a pupil of prof. Bobrov). The journey to the Far East entailed extensive travel by way of the Trans-Siberian railroad, through Irkutsk to Vladivostok and he returned to Moscow via Japan, Singapore, Ceylon and the Suez Canal to reach the Black Sea and Feodosiya. Korotkov was honoured with the Order of St. Anna for \\"outstandingly zealous labours in helping the sick and wounded soldiers\\". On his return Nikolai Korotkov turned his mind from military to academic pursuits and translated Eduard Albert's monograph \\"Die Chirurgische Diagnostik\\" from German to Russian. In 1903, Dr Sergey Fedorov was appointed professor of surgery at the Military Medical Academy at St Petersburg, and he invited Korotkov to join him as assistant surgeon. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-1905, Korotkov went to Harbin in Manchuria as senior surgeon in charge of the Second St George's Unit of the Red Cross. He became interested in vascular surgery and began to collect cases for his doctoral thesis, which included 41 of 44 case reports of patients who were part of his war experience in the hospital at Harbin. Returning to St Petersburg in April 1905 he began to prepare his thesis, but it was a presentation to the Imperial Military Medical Academy in 1905 that earned him lasting fame. The technique of blood pressure measurement was reported in less than a page (only 281 words) of the \\"Izvestie Imp. Voiennomedicinskoi Akademii\\" (Reports of the Imperial Military Medical Academy): The critical comments of Korotkov's peers were dealt with in an adroit manner, and he appeared a month later at the Imperial Military Academy with animal experiments to support his theory that the sounds he had described were produced locally, rather than in the heart. He earned the approbation of professor M. V. Yanovsky, who declared: \\"Korotkov has noticed and intelligently utilised a phenomenon which many observers have overlooked.\\" Yanovsky and his pupils verified the accuracy of the technique and described the phases of the auscultatory sounds and for a time technique was known as the Korotkov-Yanovsky method. Nikolai Korotkov, then serving as research physician to the mining district of Vitimsko-Olekminsky in Siberia, received his doctorate in 1910. After that he served as surgeon to the workers of the gold mines of Lensk. Here he witnessed Tsarist atrocities and was affected deeply by the murder of unarmed striking miners. After this Korotkov returned to St. Petersburg and during the First World War he was surgeon to \\"The Charitable House for disabled soldiers\\" in Tsarskoe Selo. He welcomed the October Revolution after which he was physician-in-chief of the Mechnikov Hospital in Petrograd until his death from lung tuberculosis on March 14, 1920. ==Associated eponyms== Mercury sphygmomanometer that belonged to Korotkoff. *Korotkoff method is a non-invasive auscultatory technique for determining both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels.

The film has won more than 40 awards at film festivals around the world. ==Plot== An on-screen title sets the action in Korea, 1951. The film tells the story of a young boy, Manuk, who roams a seemingly deserted town to glean and recycle the debris of war. We first meet him in the wreck of an aeroplane, looking for a particular piece of war refuse ‚Äì a bolt ‚Äì to turn into a toy soldier for his collection. He sings a song about a bear. Upon hearing the unmistakable low whistle of a train in the distance he runs to the track and places the bolt on the rail. The train thunders past on its urgent mission to carry tanks to the front. Manuk stands mesmerised, and grins widely. Once the train has passed he retrieves the bolt which has become magnetised. He makes his way through the town, pretending to be a soldier engaged in house-to-house fighting until his attention is captured by the drone of aeroplane engines. Silently he watches them slowly cross the sky. His war game begins again as he crouches behind rocks on a ridge overlooking an area with houses jumbled together. A postman cycles down the road below Manuk‚Äôs hiding place. Manuk imagines he is with his dad, pinned down by enemy fire. ‚ÄúDad, there are too many of them,‚Äù he cries as the sound of machine guns and artillery fire fill his head. ‚ÄúBut we are braver than them,‚Äù his father replies in the game. Manuk picks up a rock as if it is a hand grenade, expertly pulls the pin with his teeth and hurls it at the enemy crying ‚ÄúDad, get down!‚Äù He waits, crouched, fingers in ears for the explosion which never comes. Instead, we hear the postman cry in surprise and pain, before crashing his bicycle and shouting at his unseen tormentor. Manuk slinks away and climbs the hill towards his home. He takes a key from a special hiding spot, and approaches the verandah in front of his house. He notices a parcel and hurries to open it. He pulls out an old leather wallet containing a faded black and white photograph of a man crouching with a child dressed as Manuk is now, but much younger. Manuk gently caresses the photograph with his thumb. He then pulls out a set of dog tags, and an old boot. He marches up and down in front of his house, wearing the boots as if he is a soldier on guard. Later, inside the house, he plays with the toy soldiers and tanks he has made from bits and pieces of metal he has found and falls asleep on the floor. His mother appears at the door, saying ‚ÄúManuk, Mum is home‚Äù. ==Background== The film is set in Korea, during the war that pitched the north of the country and its allies China and the Soviet Union, against the south and a United Nations coalition led by the United States of America which included more than 17,000 Australian army and air force personnel. But the film is not ‚Äòabout‚Äô the war as such (as Sejong makes clear in media interviews), and is certainly not about the Australian experience of this conflict. Neither is it an explicit comment on the conflict in Iraq which began the year before the film was finished. Rather it is about the impact of war on those left behind, and so has a much more universal and timeless appeal. Part of what is exciting about the film from an Australian perspective is that it does not allude to the usual iconography or correspond with the kinds of social and cultural experiences that typically mark films from this country. It does not allude to local histories of storytelling, or overtly suggest that it can tell us something about what it means to be Australian, and yet it tells us so much about these things by telling a story from, about and set in a different place and culture. As Sung-Ae Lee has argued in a reading of the coverage of the film and its success in Korean language newspapers in Sydney, the film provided the opportunity for the celebration of diasporic achievement and success, for cultural maintenance through its remembering of the Korean War, and for empowerment of the diasporic community (Lee 2004, p. 233). At the same time, the allusions to other films, the subtlety of the film‚Äôs style as expressed through camerawork, editing, sound and music as well as mastery of digital animation techniques and a structure familiar from mainstream Hollywood cinema mark the film as a knowing and learned contribution to international screen culture. ==Analysis== The film is divided into four parts of roughly equal length and an epilogue, a structure familiar from mainstream Hollywood cinema but not so usual in Australian short filmmaking (Thompson 1999, pp. 28‚Äì44). In the first part, the setup, the protagonist, Manuk, and his world are established. Manuk‚Äôs series of overlapping goals are not all made obvious in this part, which runs up to the point that we (and Manuk) first hear the train. He is clearly very young, too young to tell us what is happening; we must piece together the story ourselves. One of the pleasures of Birthday Boy is realizing how much of the story is seeded early on but only gradually revealed, and only able to be fully assembled in the climax, to devastating final effect. Manuk‚Äôs primary goal is to be reunited with his father, to be with and like him, a soldier at war. The games he plays throughout the film revolve around this goal, most obviously in the scene with the postman, in which Manuk‚Äôs inadvertent assault on the hapless cyclist is the result of a game in which he imagines he is with his father attacking an unseen enemy. His search for the piece of metal in this opening part of the film is also directed towards the goal of reuniting with his father, if only symbolically through his imaginative play with the soldiers and tanks he builds with scavenged metal, his trophies of war. His broadest, loosest goal is to play and to occupy the time he must spend alone ‚Äì perhaps after school ‚Äì until his mother returns home. He must make his own entertainment, and he is resourceful. He is driven by the desire to play, and this is what is enchanting about him. He is imaginative and mechanically savvy, but still too young to understand what the return of his father‚Äôs possessions means. ==Reception== Birthday Boy has won over 40 awards at film festivals around the world including Best Animated Short at the SIGGRAPH Computer Animation Festival in 2004 which qualified the film for the 2005 Academy Awards even before Park and fellow students had graduated from the AFTRS. It was subsequently nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. Other awards include the Prix Jean-Luc Xiberras at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in 2005 (which had a special focus on Korea) and Best Short Animation at the 2005 BAFTA awards. It has screened at over 100 film festivals around the world, and is the most awarded film in the almost forty-year history of the AFTRS. ==References== *Australian Broadcasting Corporation page on the film == External links == * * * www.siggraph.org Category:2000s animated short films Category:2004 films Category:Films set in 1951 Category:Student films Category:Australian animated short films Category:2004 animated films ","title":"Birthday Boy (film)"},{"id":"1432807","text":"Joseph Bernard Kruskal, Jr. (; January 29, 1928 ‚Äì September 19, 2010) was an American mathematician, statistician, computer scientist and psychometrician. == Personal life == Kruskal was born to a Jewish familyAmerican Jewish Archives: \\"Two Baltic Families Who Came to America The Jacobsons and the Kruskals, 1870-1970\\" by RICHARD D. BROWN January 24, 1972 in New York City to a successful fur wholesaler, Joseph B. Kruskal, Sr. His mother, Lillian Rose Vorhaus Kruskal Oppenheimer, became a noted promoter of origami during the early era of television. Kruskal had two notable brothers, Martin David Kruskal, co-inventor of solitons, and William Kruskal, who developed the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. One of Joseph Kruskal's nephews is computer scientist Clyde Kruskal. == Education and career == He was a student at the University of Chicago earning a bachelor of science in mathematics in the year of 1948, and a master of science in mathematics in the following year 1949. After his time at the University of Chicago Kruskal attended Princeton University, where he completed his Ph.D. in 1954, nominally under Albert W. Tucker and Roger Lyndon, but de facto under Paul Erd≈ës with whom he had two very short conversations. Kruskal worked on well-quasi- orderings www.cs.tau.ac.il www.cs.tau.ac.il and multidimensional scaling. He was a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, former president of the Psychometric Society, and former president of the Classification Society of North America. He also initiated and was first president of the Fair Housing Council of South Orange and Maplewood in 1963, and actively supported civil rights in several other organizations such as CORE. He worked at Bell Labs from 1959 to 1993. == Research == In statistics, Kruskal's most influential work is his seminal contribution to the formulation of multidimensional scaling. In computer science, his best known work is Kruskal's algorithm for computing the minimal spanning tree (MST) of a weighted graph. The algorithm first orders the edges by weight and then proceeds through the ordered list adding an edge to the partial MST provided that adding the new edge does not create a cycle. Minimal spanning trees have applications to the construction and pricing of communication networks. In combinatorics, he is known for Kruskal's tree theorem (1960), which is also interesting from a mathematical logic perspective since it can only be proved nonconstructively. Kruskal also applied his work in linguistics, in an experimental lexicostatistical study of Indo-European languages, together with the linguists Isidore Dyen and Paul Black. Their database is still widely used. ==Concepts named after Joseph Kruskal== * Kruskal's algorithm (1956) * Kruskal's tree theorem (1960) * Kruskal‚ÄìKatona theorem (1963) * Kruskal rank or k-rank (1977), closely related to the spark ==References== ==External links== * *The Dyen, Kruskal and Black lexicostatistical database : the 200-meaning Swadesh lists for 95 Indo- European languages.

Among his books, his collection of essays on history, literary criticism and cultural history are remarkable. He travelled a lot through the Americas. His work is also important because of his wide perspective, studying the culture of the entire continent. He left Venezuela, under the political persecution of dictator Juan Vicente G√≥mez. Living for a large period in Chile, he studied history, gaining the degree of ‚ÄúProfesor de Historia‚Äù and later a doctorate in philosophy and letters. He came back to Venezuela in 1936, working as a professor and author. He founded the Asociaci√≥n de Escritores de Venezuela (Writers Association from Venezuela), and worked for the Ministry of Education. His studies on \\"Barroco de Indias\\" (the term that he coined to talk about the baroque from Hispanic America) are very influential among the general study of Baroque. He received the National Prize for Literature in 1954. He taught at Columbia University, New York.

Typically, this is the height of the letter x in the font (the source of the term), as well as the letters v, w, and z. (Curved letters such as a, c, e, m, n, o, r, s, and u tend to exceed the x-height slightly, due to overshoot.) One of the most important dimensions of a font, x-height is used to define how high lower-case letters without ascenders are compared to the cap height of upper- case letters. Regular and caption styles of two open-source typefaces, PT Sans and EB Garamond. The caption styles both have increased x-heights to make the text clear even printed small. EB Garamond's is also very visibly bolder. French renaissance typefaces. The smaller typeface at the bottom has a proportionally higher x-height. Display typefaces intended to be used at large sizes, such as on signs and posters, vary in x-height. Many have high x-heights to be read clearly from a distance. This, though, is not universally the case: some display typefaces such as Cochin and Koch-Antiqua intended for publicity uses have low x-heights, to give them a more elegant, delicate appearance, a mannerism that was particularly common in the early twentieth century. Many sans-serif designs that are intended for display text have high x-heights, such as Helvetica or, more extremely, Impact. Extra-small x-height in hand-written (but non-cursive) sign. ==Design considerations== Medium x-heights are found on fonts intended for body text, allowing more balance and contrast between upper- and lower-case letters and a brighter page. They then increase again for optical sizes of font designed for small print, such as captions, so that they can be clearly read printed small. An image of some common fonts on one line, comparing their usage and x-heights. High x-heights on display typefaces were particularly common in designs in the 1960s and 70s, when International Typeface Corporation released popular variations of older designs with boosted x-heights; notable examples of this trend include Avant Garde Gothic and ITC Garamond. More recently, some typefaces such as Mrs Eaves, Neutraface and Brandon Grotesque have been issued with distinctively low x-heights to try to create a more elegant appearance. While computers allow fonts to be printed at any size, professional font designers such as Adobe issue fonts in a range of optical sizes optimized to be printed at different sizes. As an example of this, Mrs Eaves exists in two versions: an original style intended to give an elegant, bright appearance, and a less distinctive 'XL' design intended for body text. Some research has suggested that while higher x-heights may help with reading smaller text, a very high x-height may be counterproductive, possibly because it becomes harder to identify the shape of a word if every letter is nearly the same height. For the same reason, some sign manuals discourage all-capitals text. ==Use in web design== In computing one use of x-height is as a unit of measurement in web pages. In CSS and LaTeX the x-height is called an ex. The use of ex in dimensioning objects, however, is less stable than use of the em across browsers. Internet Explorer, for example, dimensions ex at exactly one half of em, whereas Mozilla Firefox dimensions ex closer to the actual x-height of the font, rounded relative to the font's current pixel height. Thus, the exact ratio of ex to em can also vary by font size within a browser if the determined values are rounded to the nearest whole unit. For example, a browser calculating an x-height of 45% on a font 10 pixels tall may round ex to either 4 pixels or 5 pixels or leave it at 4.5 pixels. ==Other important dimensions== Lowercase letters whose height is greater than the x-height either have descenders which extend below the baseline, such as y, g, q, and p, or have ascenders which extend above the x-height, such as l, k, b, and d. The ratio of the x-height to the body height is one of the major characteristics that defines the appearance of a typeface. The height of the capital letters is referred to as Cap height. x-height is most important in regular designs, such as most serif and sans-serif designs; script typefaces that mimic irregular handwriting and calligraphy may not have a consistent x-height across all letters. ==See also== *Em (typography) *En (typography) *Small caps *Typographic unit ==References== ==External links== * Definition of x-height at typophile.com * In the search of ideal line-height Category:Typography ","title":"X-height"},{"id":"1432814","text":"One of the six founding members of the modern Northern League in 1993, the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks were league members from 1993 to 1998. They played their home games at Port Arthur Stadium in Thunder Bay, Ontario. == 1993 Season == The Whiskey Jacks went 36-35 in the first year of the league. Former Chicago Cubs first-round pick Ty Griffin hit .274 and tied for the league lead with 11 home runs. OF Rodney McCray (.242, .341 SLG) led the loop with 35 steals. OF Dennis Hood was eighth in average (.322), but also led the league in strikeouts (75). Yoshi Seo (4-4, 2.37) was third in the league in ERA. The team drew just over 4,000 fans per game, finishing second in league attendance behind St. Paul. == 1994 Season == In 1994, Thunder Bay had a 22-18 first half under manager Dan Shwam but fell to 13-27 in the second half. C/3B Pete Kuld (.279, .608 SLG) led the league in home runs (27) and strikeouts (81).https://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-01/sports/sp-37446_1_pete-kuld/2 Rod Steph (8-1, 2.45) was fourth in ERA and threw the first no-hitter in team history. == 1995 Season == New manager Doug Ault's club was last in the first half (14-28) but finished 24-18 in the second half, three games behind the St. Paul Saints. Pat Tilmon (4-4, 3.27) was third in the league in ERA while OF Sean Hearn hit .303, slugged .529, hit 19 home runs and stole 20 bases. Kuld homered 13 times in 164 games before being traded to the Duluth-Superior Dukes - he led the league in homers that year with 24. Two ex-MLB players filled the DH role: Francisco Cabrera (.360, .500 SLG) and Daryl Boston (.280, .391 SLG).

The Jacks' attendance of 50,429 was last in the league by over 25,000. Chad Poeck (5-8, 1 Sv, 3.21) was third in ERA, while the club boasted two All-Stars this time, Hearn (.322, .628 SLG, 20 HR) and 2B Casey Waller (.300, .461 SLG). Tilmon had a 5-3 record, 3.05 ERA. == 1997 Season == Thunder Bay was 36-48 under Jay Ward in 1997 and attendance picked up but remained last (62,496). DH Danny Lewis (.358, .663 SLG) was second in the league in average and hit 24 homers, while 37-year-old 1B Larry See (.282, .502 SLG) smacked 19 round-trippers.

The Jacks' fell to 18-24 in the second half. In the playoffs, they lost 3 games to 2 to St. Paul. Attendance continued to trail other teams with 54,566. Boynewicz (7-5, 3.40) was 4th in the league in ERA and Poeck (4-4, 3.47) was fifth. Poeck also threw the second no-hitter in team history. Lewis slipped to .316 with 17 HR and a .563 slugging, while See fell to .235 with 10 HR and a .406 slugging percentage. == Franchise Move == A city union strike in Thunder Bay forced the Whiskey Jacks to play the first month of the 1998 season on the road, costing an estimated $200,000 in lost ticket, food, and beverage sales.

The nearest town, Halesworth, is approximately 6.7 miles (10.7 km) away. Southwold is a popular, nearby coastal town. The market town of Framlingham is also close by. Cratfield is a small farming and residential community. It currently has no shop, but has a pub, The Cratfield Poacher, and several bed and breakfast hotels. Cratfield is also home to St Mary's Church (14th/15th/16th century) ‚Äì built of flint and with a square tower, mainly Perpendicular and noted particularly for its very fine font. Cratfield has had two churches and three cemeteries in the past, however in the current day it only has one church (St Mary's) and two cemeteries (St Mary's and Burial ground). The oldest part of the church is from the 14th century, however the tower is from the 15th century. In 1547 under Edward VI, \\"the parish sold all its silver rather than let it fall into government hands and therefore spent the proceeds on decorating the tower, for which they are to be commended and remembered.\\" Crafield means 'Craeta open land' which refers to open country, land without trees, level ground, land without buildings) and arable land (from late tenth century). == Statistics == The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) ranks Cratfield as 13,041 out of 32,844 in England. It is believed that employment is better than 65% of areas in England, Health is better than 86%, education is better than 53%, crime is better than 74% and overall better than 39% of the country. Cratfield's population shows that it is one that is neither significantly of old age, but neither is it a youth population. The largest age group is the 45 to 59 and the second largest is 30 to 44, this shows that it is very middle aged and for people with family which explains the 70 people under the age of 19 living in Cratfield. An explanation to why the population is slightly more popular with the elder side could be to do with the population density being at only 0.3 persons per hectare and therefore not congested. According to the 2011 census there is not a large difference of people working full-time and people working part- time (full-time 170 and part- time 112). However, for the people who are in full-time work, the highest number of people have to travel between 10 kilometres and 20 kilometres (between 6.2 and 12.4 miles) to get to work, furthermore according to the census 7 people have to travel over 60 kilometres ( 37.3 miles and over). This shows that Cratfield is a distance from most businesses and industrial areas, which are located in bigger towns such as Halesworth which is approximately 6.7 miles away. == Geography == Cratfield is approximately 115 miles North East from London, 29 miles north of Ipswich and equally 29 miles south of Norwich. Furthermore, it is 7.5 miles from the coast line and lies 49 metres above sea level. In addition to this the area is built on a mixture of London Clay (which is very dense) and chalk and believed to be aged between 1.5 and 3.5 million years old, this is also mixed in with volcanic ash which proves that there must have been volcanic activity in the past. ==Historical Writings== In 1870‚Äì72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described the village as: :Cratfield, a parish in Blything district, Suffolk; 6 miles WSW of Halesworth r. station.

In 1887, John Bartholomew also wrote an entry on Cratfield in the Gazetteer of the British Isles with a much shorter description: :Cratfield, par., E. Suffolk, 6 miles SW. of Halesworth ry. sta., 2085 ac., pop. 495; P.O. ==Notable residents== *John Laney, politician, lawyer and member of parliament during Queen Elizabeth I's reign and especially in the years between 1586‚Äì1589 as he was occasionally made of use by the Privy Council to settle disputes in Suffolk. *William Keable, 18th C. painter of portraits and conversation pieces *John Laney, Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich in 1586 == Demography == According to the Census report for Cratfield, the biggest decline in population took part between the years of 1891 and 1901 with the village decreasing by 75 people, 47 of whom were males and 28 who were females. this would have been due to a mixture of the elderly dying and poor health through diseases. On the other hand, the biggest increase in population across the time scale was from 1801 to 1811 with an increase of 100 people, 35 were male and 65 were female. The population has stayed fairly consistent between males and females across the time series, however there has been a few anomalies such as in 1951 there was 32 more males (172 males to 140 females) and in 1811 where there was 2 more females (313 males to 338 females). Cratfield's area (in acres) has also expanded from 1,930 in 1831 to 2,127 which isn't a huge difference but still an expansion nevertheless.leftleft == Economy == According to the 1831 occupation census in Cratfield, there were 22 professionals, 43 middling sorts, 103 servants and then 6 'others'. The 43 middling sorts were the middle class and meant that they were either craftsmen or farmers. In the case of Cratfield due to its open, arable land, most or all of them were small-scale farmers. To add to this, the 22 professionals that were in the area made up the upper class, whom would have employed a large number of the servants in the area. right The 1881 Occupation structure census shows that a large proportion of people worked in agriculture or construction of carriages. This is because, as explained in the name Cratfield (Craeta open land), there is arable land which can and is used for farming and agricultural needs. As well as this, there is a noticeable number of domestic servants which shows that there must have been a few wealthy people living in this area during this time period. According to the 2011 census, the number of people aged between 16 and 74, in employment in Cratfield, was 141. To break down the 141 people employed in Cratfield, 18 of them are managers, directors, or senior officials. 20 of them are technical occupants which covers jobs in the public sector such as health and teaching, while 13 have administrative jobs, 34 have skilled trades which include jobs such as plumbers and builders. 12 are employed in care, leisure, 2 are in sales, 7 are in machine operations and 18 are in elementary occupations. == Current day == Cratfield currently has 26 listed buildings within it, 25 of them Grade 2 listed and St Mary's church being Grade 1 listed. Cratfield has a village hall called Manse Lane (social club) which can hold up to 100 people at one time whereas the small hall can only hold up to 48 people, and complemented by 50 parking spaces. The nearest primary school is All Saints Church of England primary school in Laxfield and the nearest secondary school is Halesworth Middle school. In addition to this Cratfield has a very limited bus service with two pick up points being Bell Green and Chestnut view. As well as this Cratfield has two cottages that are available to stay in (School farm cottages and Holly tree barns). The area also has a fairly high car and van count with the number being at 252, adding to the 77,473 other vehicles based in the Suffolk Coastal region. Cratfield doesn't have much cultural diversity according to the 2011 census report with 201 of its population being of a Christian background and another 86 with non- or not stated their religion. There was one Buddhist and two of Jewish religion. This shows that Cratfield has not been culturally diversified, this could be to do with its lack of job prospects and homing. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Suffolk Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk ","title":"Cratfield"},{"id":"1432841","text":"Chronica Jutensis (Danish: Jyske Kr√∏nike English: Jutland Chronicle) also known as Continuatio compendii Saxonis or Chronica Danorum, is a small Danish historical work from the middle of the 14th century, written in Latin. It comes with a smaller summary edition, about one-fourth the size of the original, of Saxo‚Äôs Gesta Danorum, known as Compendium Saxonis. The original manuscript is lost; however the work survives in four different handwritten copies, about a hundred years younger. One of them was written by a monk from Odense in 1431. The stories of Chronica Jutensis begin approximately where Gesta Danorum ends, in King Canute VI's reign, just before King Valdemar II gains the throne, and end with the beginning of King Valdemar Atterdag's reign, about 1342. It was written somewhere around 1342-1350\\\\. Since the book does not mention Estonia being sold to the Livonian Order, which happened on 29 September 1346, it must have been written before this date or only shortly after. It would probably not be common knowledge for a few years, so it may have been written after 1346. The author is not known. It is, however, thought that he was from Jutland because Jutland events and persons are thoroughly described and it seems that the writer is confident with both the topography and persons of Jutland.

The demonstration of some 350,000 Moroccans advanced several kilometres into the Western Sahara territory, escorted by nearly 20,000 Moroccan troops, and meeting very little response from the Sahrawi Polisario Front. Nevertheless, the events quickly escalated into a fully waged war between Morocco and the militias of the Polisario, the Western Sahara War, which would last for 16 years. Morocco later gained control over most of the former Spanish Sahara, which it continues to hold. ==Background== Morocco, to the north of the Spanish Sahara, had long claimed that the territory was historically an integral part of Morocco. Mauritania to the south argued similarly that the territory was in fact Mauritanian. Since 1973, a Sahrawi guerrilla war led by the Polisario Front (armed and financed by Algiers) had challenged Spanish control, and in October 1975 Spain had quietly begun negotiations for a handover of power with leaders of the rebel movement, both in El Aai√∫n, and with foreign minister Pedro Cortina y Mauri meeting El Ouali in Algiers. Morocco intended to vindicate its claims by demanding a verdict from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was issued on 16 October 1975. The ICJ stated that there were historical legal ties of allegiance between \\"some, but only some\\" Sahrawi tribes and the Sultan of Morocco, as well as ties including some rights relating to the land between Mauritania and other Sahrawi tribes. However, the ICJ stated also that there were no ties of territorial sovereignty between the territory and Morocco, or Mauritania, at the time of Spanish colonization; and that these contacts were not extensive enough to support either country's demand for annexation of the Spanish Sahara. Instead, the court argued, the indigenous population (the Sahrawis) were the owners of the land, and thus possessed the right of self- determination. This meant that regardless of which political solution was found to the question of sovereignty (integration with Spain, Morocco, Mauritania, partition, or independence), it had to be explicitly approved by the people of the territory. Complicating matters, a UN visiting mission had concluded on 15 October, the day before the ICJ verdict was released, that Sahrawi support for independence was \\"overwhelming\\". However, the reference to previous Moroccan-Sahrawi ties of allegiance was presented by Hassan II as a vindication of his position, with no public mention of the court's further ruling on self-determination. (Seven years later, he formally agreed to a referendum before the Organisation of African Unity). Within hours of the ICJ verdict's release, he announced the organizing of a \\"green march\\" to Spanish Sahara, to \\"reunite it with the Motherland\\". In order to prepare the terrain and to riposte to any potential counter-invasion from Algeria (interested by the access to the Atlantic and the potential gas resources) or in order to invade militarily the land and kill or deport the Sahrawi population (according to the Polisario Front), the Moroccan Army entered the northeast of the region on October 31, where it met with hard resistance from the Polisario, by then a two-year-old independence movement. ==The Green March== dirham note from 1991 commemorating the Green March The Green March was a well-publicized popular march of enormous proportions. On 6 November 1975 approximately 350,000 unarmed Moroccans converged on the city of Tarfaya in southern Morocco and waited for a signal from King Hassan II to cross into the region of Sakiya Lhmra. They brandished Moroccan flags and Qur'an; banners calling for the \\"return of the Moroccan Sahara,\\" photographs of the King and the Qur'an; the color green for the march's name was intended as a symbol of Islam. As the marchers reached the border, the Spanish Armed Forces were ordered not to fire to avoid bloodshed. The Spanish troops also cleared some previously mined zones. ==The Moroccan arguments for sovereignty== According to Morocco, the exercise of sovereignty by the Moroccan state was characterized by official pledges of allegiance to the sultan. The Moroccan government was of the opinion that this allegiance existed during several centuries before the Spanish occupation and that it was a legal and political tie.ICJ, Reports 1975, p. 83. For more details, Cf. pp. 83-102. Cf. also individual opinion of Judge M. Forster. Idem p. 103 and Annex no. 7. The sultan Hassan I, for example, had carried out two expeditions in 1886 in order to put an end to foreign incursions in this territory and to officially invest several caids and cadis. In its presentation to the ICJ, the Moroccan side also mentioned the levy of taxes as a further instance of the exercise of sovereignty.ICJ, Western Sahara Pleadings, Arguments, Documents, Volume 111, Written Statements and Documents, pp. 205 to 497. The exercise of this sovereignty had also appeared, according to the Moroccan government, at other levels, such as the appointment of local officials (governors and military officers), and the definition of the missions which were assigned to them.* Nomination Dahirs, dating back to the reign of Moulay Abdelaziz Bel Hassan, (Two Dahirs in 1886 and two in 1899), of Abdelhafid Bel Hassan (1907 and 1909), and Dahirs of El Hassan Ben Mohammed (1877 and 1886) of Abdelaziz Ben El H~Hassan (1901) The Moroccan government further pointed to several treaties between it and other states, such as with Spain in 1861, the United States of America in 1786, and 1836 and with Great Britain in 1856 The treaties are the following: * Trading Treaty between Morocco and Spain in Madrid on November 20, 1861 * Treaty of Friendship with the USA on June 23 to 28, 1786. * Treaty of peace and friendship between the USA and Morocco, signed in Meknes on September 16, 1856 * Anglo-Moroccan Accords, December 9, 1856. The court, however, found that \\"neither the internal nor the international acts relied upon by Morocco indicate the existence at the relevant period of either the existence or the international recognition of legal ties of territorial sovereignty between Western Sahara and the Moroccan State. Even taking account of the specific structure of that State, they do not show that Morocco displayed any effective and exclusive State activity in Western Sahara.\\" ==The Madrid Accords== The Green March caught Spain in a moment of political crisis. The caudillo General Franco, who had led the country for 36 years, was dying. Despite the overwhelming military and logistic superiority of the Spanish armed forces based in Western Sahara in relation to the Moroccan armed forces, the Spanish government feared that the conflict with Morocco could lead to an open colonial war in Africa, which could put Francoist Spain into question and lead to an abrupt political change or a social instability and disaster. The Spanish government, directed by Prince Juan Carlos, who was acting Head of State in substitution of General Franco, and the incumbent Prime Minister Don Carlos Arias Navarro, was in no mood for troubles in the colony. Only the year before, the Portuguese government had been toppled by the Portuguese armed forces after becoming bogged down in colonial wars in Angola and Mozambique. Therefore, following the Green March, and with a view to avoid war and preserving as much as possible of its interest in the territory, Spain agreed to enter direct bilateral negotiations with Morocco, bringing in also Mauritania, who had made similar demands. Under pressure from Morocco, Spain also agreed that no representatives of the native population would be present in the negotiations that resulted in the 14 November Madrid Accords. This was a treaty which divided Spanish Sahara between Mauritania and Morocco.Trilateral Agreement concluded exclusively between the Spanish, Moroccan and Mauritanian Governments, the text of which has been transmitted to the Secretary General of the UN on November 18, 1975. (Resolution 3458 (XXX) B. 10/12/1975). In the agreements Spain agreed to cede the possession of the colony to Morocco and Mauritania, under the condition, expressed in point 3 of the Trilateral Agreement, that the views of the Saharan population had to be respected. Spain received a 35% concession in the phosphate mines of Bou Craa and offshore fishing rights that were not respected by Morocco. Morocco and Mauritania then formally annexed the parts they had been allotted in the Accords. Morocco claimed the northern part, i.e. Saguia el-Hamra and approximately half of R√≠o de Oro, while Mauritania proceeded to occupy the southern third of the country under the name Tiris al-Gharbiyya. Mauritania later abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979 and ceded this area to Popular Army of Saharwi Liberation (Polisario), but it was instead promptly occupied by Morocco. Nevertheless, Mauritania preserved for itself a small area called Ras Nouadhibou to preserve the security of its capital Nouakchott. The Polisario, now with heavy Algerian backing, refused the Madrid Accords, and demanded that the ICJ's opinion on Sahrawi self-determination be respected; it turned its weapons on the new rulers of the country, sticking to its demand for independence outright, or a referendum on the matter. The conflict has still not been resolved. Currently, there is a cease-fire in effect, after a Moroccan-Polisario agreement was struck in 1991 to solve the dispute through the organization of a referendum on independence. A UN peace- keeping mission (MINURSO) has been charged with overseeing the cease-fire and organizating the referendum, which has still not taken place . Morocco has rejected the idea of the referendum as not workable in 2000 and is suggesting an autonomy for Western Sahara within Morocco. That proposal been rejected by Spain, the Polisario, and also by its Algerian backers; it was presented to the UN in April 2007. Spain is divided between its desire to preserve a good relation with Morocco, its Southern neighbour with whom it shares terrestrial borders in Ceuta and Melilla, and its responsibility to the international legality as the former colonial power. The traditional position of all the Spanish democratic governments until the arrival of Prime Minister Zapatero to the Government, had been that the wishes of the Saharian population have to be respected, and of support to the organization of the referendum requested by the United Nations. According to the US Department of State's documents leaked by Wikileaks, Spain, under Zapatero, has changed its traditional position concerning the organisation of the referendum for the Sahara, and now supports the Moroccan position. The documents also stated that Spain had been trying to broker an agreement between the two parties. However, in her speech to the Spanish Parliament of 15 December 2010, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Trinidad Jimenez denied that Spain supports the Moroccan position in Spanish Sahara. She also argued that Spain will support any agreement between the Polisario and Morocco. ==See also== * History of Western Sahara * List of Spanish colonial wars in Morocco ==References== Category:Western Sahara conflict Category:November Category:Marching Category:1975 in Spanish Sahara Category:Morocco‚ÄìSpain relations Category:Settlement schemes Category:1975 in Morocco Category:Politically motivated migrations ","title":"Green March"},{"id":"1432854","text":"Juan Manuel Garc√≠a Gr√ºber (September 7, 1904 ‚Äì September 21, 1997) was a Venezuelan economist, financier, writer, philosopher and diplomat.

He was standing right next to Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a when he was shot to death by Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez in 1956. Throughout his lifetime, he wrote extensively on oil, democracy, arts, renaissance and various cultural subjects. Dr. Garc√≠a Gr√ºber participated in the rescue of his family when they were held captive in revolutionary Nicaragua. In 1979, a plane from the Venezuelan Air Force piloted by his wife's nephew, Captain Ra√∫l Hern√°ndez, was hastily sent in order to help set the hostages free. According to different news broadcasts at the time, the family was a victim of the Somoza guerrilla (sandinista) and provisions had been made to kill them right before they attempted to escape through the nearest airport. Their liberation was eventually possible when the Venezuelan aircraft opened fire against sandinista soldiers who tried to thwart the operation. Later in life, he became President of the Venezuelan Institute for Hispanic Culture in Caracas, Venezuela. Dr. Garc√≠a Gr√ºber received several awards for his achievements (and was recognized as a peer by the most respected Hispanic language and literature academicians) which included, among others, the Order of the Liberator Simon Bolivar, Order of the Ibero American Chamber, Venezuelan Red Cross Order in its first degree plus two hundred or so medals. He was a highly esteemed figure both in his native Venezuela as well as abroad.

His strong ties to the embassies of Spain, Colombia, Per√∫, Panam√° and Nicaragua account for his numerous accolades in the diplomatic and cultural fields. His work as a universal writer was published by influential editorial houses in Venezuela as he became an incisive columnist in well-known local newspapers. He regularly condemned his country's political ways and the ever-growing scourge of corruption in Latin America. He had a long time personal and professional association with his brother in law, Dr. Jorge G√≥mez Mantellini, former Governor of Caracas. As part of his duties as head of the Venezuelan Institute for Hispanic Culture, he unveiled the first statue of Spanish monarch Isabel La Cat√≥lica ever to grace a Caracas square. ==Personal life== He was married to Bertha Dom√≠nguez Urbano-Taylor, a sibling of Ricardo Dom√≠nguez Urbano-Taylor.

After a single, poorly received, screening of the full-length version, the film was severely cut at the request of the studio. This was against Kurosawa's wishes. When the re-edited version was also deemed too long by the studio, Kurosawa sardonically suggested the film be cut lengthwise instead. According to Japanese film scholar Donald Richie, there are no existing prints of the original 265-minute version. Kurosawa would return to Shochiku later to make Rhapsody in August (1991), and, according to Alex Cox, is said to have searched the Shochiku archives for the original cut of the film to no avail. ==Reception== Rotten Tomatoes reports 78% approval for The Idiot among nine critics, with an average rating of 6.9/10. ==See also== *List of incomplete or partially lost films ==References* * Category:1951 films Category:1951 drama films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese drama films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Japanese black-and-white films Category:Films based on The Idiot Category:Films directed by Akira Kurosawa Category:Films with screenplays by Akira Kurosawa Category:Shochiku films Category:Films scored by Fumio Hayasaka Category:Films set in Hokkaido ","title":"The Idiot (1951 film)"},{"id":"1432866","text":"Gonzalo Parra-Aranguren (5 December 1928 - 3 December 2016) is a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.

In CMYK printing, registration black refers to 100% coverage in each of the four process colors: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K). More generally, if a different mixture of colors is being used, registration black marks in each of the colorants (inks) used. It is therefore not correct to simply define registration color as 100% of C,M,Y,K, since it will rather be 100% of whichever colors are used in reproduction. Registration black is used for printing crop marks, or \\"registration marks\\". When proofs for each color are generated on separate pieces of film, use of registration black makes crop marks visible on all channels, providing a useful reference for alignment. A thin line printed in registration black can also be used to check whether the printing plates are lined up. ==PostScript== The PostScript printer description languages supports registration black, starting with PostScript language level 2. This is done by referring to a spot color with the special name All. This never generates a spot plate. Instead it marks all of the plates that are there. The All color space can be used with a tint value between 0.0 (no mark) to 1.0 (full intensity). Generally, only 1.0 would be used. The name \\"All\\" might not be used in the user interface of a design program, especially outside English language speaking areas. However, the spot color must have the exact name \\"All\\". As a side effect, it is impossible in PostScript to create a normal spot plate with this name. ==PDF== The Portable document format (PDF) also includes a spot color called All, with the same restrictions, starting with PDF 1.2. Note that a PDF spot color must also include a \\"tint transform\\" which translates spot values into a different color space for viewing on screen, or printing to printers without spot color support.

According to tradition, they moved there from an area east of the Mississippi just before Columbus' arrival in the Americas. Siouan-speaking tribes such as the Omaha, Osage, Quapaw and Kaw also have traditions of having migrated to the West from east of the Mississippi River. The invasions of the Iroquois from their traditional base in the north pushed those tribes out of the Ohio River area.Louis F.

Scholars are not able to determine precisely when the Dhegiha Siouan tribes migrated west, but know the Iroquois also pushed tribes out from the Ohio and West Virginia areas in the Beaver Wars. The Iroquois maintained the lands as hunting grounds.Rollins 96-100 The Ponca appear on a 1701 map by Pierre-Charles Le Sueur, who placed them along the upper Missouri. In 1789, fur trader Juan Baptiste Munier was given an exclusive license to trade with the Ponca at the mouth of the Niobrara River. He founded a trading post at its confluence with the Missouri, where he found about 800 Ponca residing. Shortly after that, the tribe was hit by a devastating smallpox epidemic. In 1804, when they were visited by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, only about 200 Ponca remained. Later in the 19th century, their number rose to about 700.About the Ponca Tribe.

Conflict between the Ponca and the Sioux/Lakota, who now claimed the land as their own by US law, forced the US to remove the Ponca from their own ancestral lands. ==Relocation== When Congress decided to remove several northern tribes to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in 1876, the Ponca were on the list. After inspecting the lands the US government offered for their new reservation and finding it unsuitable for agriculture, the Ponca chiefs decided against a move to the Indian Territory. Hence, when governmental officials came in early 1877 to move the Ponca to their new land, the chiefs refused, citing their earlier treaty. Most of the tribe refused and had to be moved by force. In their new location, the Ponca struggled with malaria, a shortage of food and the hot climate. One in four members died within the first year. ==Standing Bear== Chief Standing Bear was among those who had most vehemently protested the tribe's removal. When his eldest son, Bear Shield, lay on his deathbed, Standing Bear promised to have him buried on the tribe's ancestral lands. In order to carry out his promise, Standing Bear left the reservation in Oklahoma and traveled back toward the Ponca homelands. He was arrested for doing so without US government permission and ordered confined at Fort Omaha. Many people took up his cause, and two prominent attorneys offered their services pro bono. Standing Bear filed a habeas corpus suit challenging his arrest. In Standing Bear v. Crook (1879), held in Omaha, Nebraska, the US District Court established for the first time that Native Americans are \\"persons within the meaning of the law\\" of the United States, and that they have certain rights as a result. This was an important civil rights case. ==Nebraska== In 1881, the US returned 26,236 acres (106 km¬≤) of Knox County, Nebraska to the Ponca, and about half the tribe moved back north from Indian Territory. The tribe continued to decline. In the 1930s, the University of Nebraska and the Smithsonian Institution conducted an archeological project to identify and save prehistoric artifacts before they were destroyed during agricultural development. The team excavated a prehistoric Ponca village, which included large circular homes up to sixty feet in diameter, located almost two miles (3 km) along the south bank of the Niobrara River.

After World War II, the US government began a policy of terminating its relationship with tribes. In 1966, the US federal government terminated the tribe (then called the Northern Ponca). It distributed its land by allotment to members, and sold off what it called surplus. Many individuals sold off their separate allotments over the decades, sometimes being tricked by speculators. In the 1970s, the tribe started efforts to reorganize politically. Members wanted to revive the cultural identity of its people and improve their welfare. First, they sought state recognition and then allied with their Congressional representatives to seek legislation for federal recognition. On October 31, 1990, the Ponca Restoration Bill was signed into law, and they were recognized as the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. They are now trying to rebuild a land base on their ancestral lands. They are the only federally recognized tribe in Nebraska without a reservation. Today the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska has over 2,783 enrolled members and is headquartered in Niobrara, Nebraska. ==Oklahoma== After the 1877 forced relocation onto the Quapaw Reservation in Indian Territory, the tribe moved west to their own lands along the Arkansas and Salt Fork Rivers. The full-bloods formed a tipi village, while the mixed-bloods settled about Chikaskia River. During opposition by Ponca leadership, the US government began dismantling tribal government under the Curtis Act. In an attempt to encourage assimilation (and to allow Oklahoma to become a state), they allotted reservation lands to individual members under the Dawes Act in 1891 and 1892. Any land remaining after allotment was made available for sale to non-natives. After Oklahoma achieved statehood, some remaining Ponca land was leased or sold to the 101 Ranch, where many Ponca people found employment. The 1911 discovery of oil on Ponca lands provided revenues but had mixed results. There were environmental disasters as oil refineries dumped waste directly into the Arkansas River. In 1918, two Ponca men, Frank Eagle and Louis McDonald, helped co-found the Native American Church.Mark Van de Logt, \\"Ponca\\", Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. 2009 (14 December 2016) In 1950 the tribe organized a new government under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act.

It is long, parallel to and east of Bond Street from Piccadilly through to Burlington Gardens. It is one of the precursors of the mid-19th-century European shopping gallery and the modern shopping mall. It is near the similar Piccadilly Arcade. The arcade was built in 1818 to the order of George Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington, younger brother of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, who had inherited the adjacent Burlington House, on what had been the side garden of the house and was reputedly to prevent passers-by throwing oyster shells and other rubbish over the wall of his home. It was designed by architect Samuel Ware. Burlington Arcade was built \\"for the sale of jewellery and fancy articles of fashionable demand, for the gratification of the public\\". However, it was also said to have been built so that the Lord's wife could shop safely amongst other genteel ladies and gentleman away from the busy, dirty, and crime ridden open streets of London. Burlington Arcade opened on 20 March 1819. From the outset, it positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive upmarket shopping venue, with shops offering luxury goods. It was one of London's earliest covered shopping arcades and one of several arcades that were constructed in Western Europe in the early 19th century. Other examples of grand shopping arcades include: Covered passages of Paris, Palais Royal in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791), Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels and The Passage in St. Petersburg, the Galleria Umberto I in Naples, and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan (1878). The original arcade consisted of a single straight top-lit walkway lined with 72 small 2-storey units. Some of the units have been combined, reducing the number of shops to around 40. The Piccadilly fa√ßade, with sculptures carved by Benjamin Clemens, a professor of sculpture at the Royal College of Art, was added in 1911. The arcade is patrolled by beadles in traditional uniforms including top hats and frockcoats. The original beadles were all former members of Lord George Cavendish's regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars. The arcade maintains Regency decorum by banning singing, humming, hurrying, and \\"behaving boisterously\\". Present tenants include a range of clothing, footwear and accessory shops, art and antique dealers and the jewellers and dealers in antique silver for which the Arcade is best known. ==Historical events== The arcade was almost destroyed by fire in 1836, when several shops were destroyed, in 1871, and in 1936, when the arcade was subject to looting. Parts of the arcade were badly damaged in a bombing raid during World War II. In 1964, a Jaguar Mark X charged down the arcade, scattering pedestrians, and six masked men leapt out, smashed the windows of the Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Association shop and stole jewellery valued at ¬£35,000. They were never caught. Gates were installed to prevent this from happening again. In 2010, Thor Equities and Meyer Bergman acquired the property for ¬£104 million. The ownership hired architect Michael Blair to restore the arcade. In May 2018, the property was sold to David and Simon Reuben for ¬£300 million. ==See also== *Royal Arcade, London *Piccadilly Arcade *Kensington Arcade *Sicilian Avenue *Woburn Walk *Leadenhall Market ==References== Category:1819 establishments in England Category:Art Nouveau architecture in London Category:Art Nouveau retail buildings Category:Buildings and structures in Mayfair Category:Buildings and structures on Piccadilly Category:Burlington Estate Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1819 Category:Grade II listed buildings in the City of Westminster Category:Georgian architecture in London Category:Shopping arcades in England Category:Shopping malls established in 1819 Category:Shopping centres in the City of Westminster Category:Tourist attractions in the City of Westminster ","title":"Burlington Arcade"},{"id":"1432945","text":"Cognitive disorders (CDs), also known as neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), are a category of mental health disorders that primarily affect cognitive abilities including learning, memory, perception, and problem solving. Neurocognitive disorders include delirium and mild and major neurocognitive disorder (previously known as dementia). They are defined by deficits in cognitive ability that are acquired (as opposed to developmental), typically represent decline, and may have an underlying brain pathology. The DSM-5 defines six key domains of cognitive function: executive function, learning and memory, perceptual-motor function, language, complex attention, and social cognition. Although Alzheimer's disease accounts for the majority of cases of neurocognitive disorders, there are various medical conditions that affect mental functions such as memory, thinking, and the ability to reason, including frontotemporal degeneration, Huntington‚Äôs disease, Lewy body disease, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Parkinson‚Äôs disease, prion disease, and dementia/neurocognitive issues due to HIV infection. Neurocognitive disorders are diagnosed as mild and major based on the severity of their symptoms. While anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders can also have an effect on cognitive and memory functions, the DSM-IV-TR does not consider these cognitive disorders, because loss of cognitive function is not the primary (causal) symptom. Additionally, developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder are typically developed at birth or early in life as opposed to the acquired nature of neurocognitive disorders. Causes vary between the different types of disorders but most include damage to the memory portions of the brain. Treatments depend on how the disorder is caused. Medication and therapies are the most common treatments; however, for some types of disorders such as certain types of amnesia, treatments can suppress the symptoms but there is currently no cure. == Cognitive mental disorder perspective == In abnormal psychology, cognitive disorders are mental disorders that develop on the basis of cognitive mental disorder perspective. The cognitive mental disorder perspective is the theory that psychological disorders originate from an interruption, whether short or long, in our basic cognitive functions, i.e. memory processing, perception, problem solving and language. This perspective takes opposition to the psychodynamic mental disorder perspective, behavioral mental disorder perspective, sociocultural mental disorder perspective, interpersonal mental disorder perspective and neurological/biological mental disorder perspective. One pioneer of cognitive disorder perspective is Albert Ellis. In 1962, Ellis proposed that humans develop irrational beliefs/goals about the world; and therefore, create disorders in cognitive abilities.Alloy, et al., 2005 Another pioneer of the cognitive disorder perspective is Aaron Beck. In 1967, Beck designed what is known as the \\"cognitive model\\" for emotional disorders, mainly depression. His model showed that a blending of negative cognitive functions about the self, the world, and possible selves lead to cognitive mental disorders. == Classifications == The previous edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) included a section entitled \\"Delirium, Dementia and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders,\\" which was revised in DSM-5 to the broader \\"Neurocognitive Disorders.\\" Neurocognitive disorders are described as those with ‚Äúa significant impairment of cognition or memory that represents a marked deterioration from a previous level of function‚Äù. The subsections include delirium and mild and major neurocognitive disorder. === Delirium === Delirium develops rapidly over a short period of time and is characterized by a disturbance in cognition, manifested by confusion, excitement, disorientation, and a clouding of consciousness. Hallucinations and illusions are common, and some individuals may experience acute onset change of consciousness. It is a disorder that makes situational awareness and processing new information very difficult for those diagnosed. It usually has a high rate of onset ranging from minutes to hours and sometimes days, but it does not last for very long, only a few hours to weeks. Delirium can also be accompanied by a shift in attention, mood swings, violent or unordinary behaviors, and hallucinations. It can be caused by a preexisting medical condition. Delirium during a hospital stay can result in a longer stay and more risk of complications and long terms stays. === Mild and major neurocognitive disorder === Mild and major neurocognitive disorders are usually associated with but not restricted to the elderly. Unlike delirium, conditions under these disorders develop slowly and are characterized by memory loss. In addition to memory loss and cognitive impairment, other symptoms include aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, loss of abstract thought, behavioral/personality changes, and impaired judgment. There may also be behavioral disturbances including psychosis, mood, and agitation. Mild and major neurocognitive disorders are differentiated based on the severity of their symptoms. Previously known as dementia, major neurocognitive disorder is characterized by significant cognitive decline and interference with independence, while mild neurocognitive disorder is characterized by moderate cognitive decline and does not interfere with independence. To be diagnosed, it must not be due to delirium or other mental disorder. They are also usually accompanied by another cognitive dysfunction. For non-reversible causes of dementia such as age, the slow decline of memory and cognition is lifelong. It can be diagnosed by screening tests such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). == Causes == === Delirium === Delirium can be caused by the worsening of previous medical conditions, substance abuse or withdrawal, mental illness, severe pain, immobilization, sleep deprivation and hypnosis. Other common causes that may increase the risk of delirium include infections of urinary tract, skin and stomach, pneumonia, old age, and poor nutrition. === Mild and major neurocognitive disorder === Neurocognitive disorders can have numerous causes: genetics, brain trauma, stroke, and heart issues. The main causes are neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease because they affect or deteriorate brain functions. Other diseases and conditions that cause NDCs include vascular dementia, frontotemporal degeneration, Lewy body disease, prion disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and dementia/neurocognitive issues due to HIV infection. They may also include dementia due to substance abuse or exposure to toxins. Neurocognitive disorder may also be caused by brain trauma, including concussions and traumatic brain injuries, as well as post-traumatic stress and alcoholism. This is referred to as amnesia, and is characterized by damage to major memory encoding parts of the brain such as the hippocampus. Difficulty creating recent term memories is called anterograde amnesia and is caused by damage to the hippocampus part of the brain, which is a major part of the memory process. Retrograde amnesia is also caused by damage to the hippocampus, but the memories that were encoded or in the process of being encoded in long term memory are erased == Treatment == === Delirium === Before delirium treatment, the cause must be established. Medication such as antipsychotics or benzodiazepines can help reduce the symptoms for some cases. For alcohol or malnourished cases, vitamin B supplements are recommended and for extreme cases, life-support can be used. === Mild and major neurocognitive disorder === There is no cure for neurocognitive disorder or the diseases that cause it. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, and other medications that treat memory loss and behavioral symptoms are available and may help to treat the diseases. Ongoing psychotherapy and psychosocial support for patients and families are usually necessary for clear understanding and proper management of the disorder and to maintain a better quality of life for everyone involved. Speech therapy has been shown to help with language impairment, therefore improving long term development and academic outcome. Studies suggest that diets with high Omega 3 content, low in saturated fats and sugars, along with regular exercise can increase the level of brain plasticity. Other studies have shown that mental exercise such a newly developed ‚Äúcomputerized brain training programs‚Äù can also help build and maintain targeted specific areas of the brain. These studies have been very successful for those diagnosed with schizophrenia and can improve fluid intelligence, the ability to adapt and deal with new problems or challenges the first time encountered, and in young people, it can still be effective in later life. A person with amnesia may slowly be able to recall their memories or work with an occupational therapist to learn new information to replace what was lost, or to use intact memories as a basis for taking in new information. If it is caused by an underlying cause such as Alzheimer's disease or infections, the cause may be treated but the amnesia may not be. ==See also== * List of cognitive disorders == Notes == == References == ","title":"Cognitive disorder"},{"id":"1432949","text":"Dementia is a cognitive disorder.

Farren has stated that The Deviants were originally a community band which \\"did things every now and then‚Äîit was a total assault thing with a great deal of inter-relation and interdependence\\". Musically, Farren described their sound as \\"teeth-grinding, psychedelic rock\\" somewhere between The Stooges and The Mothers of Invention. The Deviants have been described as a transition between classic British psych and the punk/heavy metal aesthetic of the 1970s. ==History== ===1960s=== The Social Deviants were founded by singer/writer Mick Farren in 1967 out of the Ladbroke Grove UK Underground community, featuring Pete Munro on bass; Clive Muldoon on guitar, Mike Robinson on guitar and a drummer called Benny (surname unknown)Give The Anarchist A Cigarette Chapter: The Highest Percentage Of Social Deviants Mick Farren, Pimlico 2001 who was soon replaced by Russell Hunter (born Barry Russell Hunter, 26 April 1946, in Woking, Surrey).Larkin C 'Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) p.151 The band shortened their name to \\"The Deviants\\" after Munro and Muldoon left and were replaced by Sid Bishop on guitar (born Ian Bishop, 17 December 1946, Balham, South West London) and Cord Rees on bass. With the financial backing of Nigel Samuel, the 21-year-old son of a millionaire, whom Farren had befriended, the group independently recorded their debut album Ptooff!, selling copies through the UK Underground press before it was picked up by Decca Records. This LP had been reissued on Drop Out Records (1992), Captain Trip Records (2004), Esoteric Recordings (2009), and Angel Air Records (2013); additionally, a 10\\" EP with excerpts from Ptooff!! was released on Alive/Total Energy Records (1996) under the name Social Deviants. Rees left the band in June 1967 to be replaced by Farren's flatmate Duncan Sanderson (born Stuart Duncan Sanderson, 31 December 1948, in Carlisle, Cumbria) and the band released a second album Disposable through the independent label Stable Records. When Bishop married and left the band, Farren recruited Canadian guitarist Paul Rudolph (born Paul Fraser Rudolph, 14 June 1947, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) at the suggestion of Jamie Mandelkau. This band recorded and released the album The Deviants 3 through Transatlantic Records. During a tour of North America's west coast the relationship between Farren and the musicians became personally and musically strained, and the band decided to continue without Farren, who returned to England where he teamed up with ex-Pretty Things drummer Twink (born John Charles Alder, 29 November 1944, in Colchester, Essex) and Steve Peregrin Took (born Stephen Ross Porter, 28 July 1949, in Eltham, South East London) to record the album Mona ‚Äì The Carnivorous Circus, an album interspersed with interviews with Took and a member of the U.K Hells Angels before concentrating on music journalism. The three remaining musicians - Rudolph, Sanderson and Hunter - continued in North America for some months occasionally playing gigs there under the Deviants name, before returning to England early in 1970, and teaming up with Twink to form the Pink Fairies. ===1970s onwards=== In the mid-1970s, Farren was offered a one-off deal by Stiff Records to record an EP, Screwed Up, which was released under the name Mick Farren and the Deviants. The musicians on this record included Rudolph, former Pink Fairies/Mot√∂rhead guitarist Larry Wallis, former Warsaw Pakt guitarist Andy Colquhoun and former Hawkwind drummer Alan Powell. This band, without Rudolph, went on to record the album Vampires Stole My Lunch Money and the non-album single \\"Broken Statue\\", both credited to Mick Farren rather than The Deviants. At the end of the 1970s Farren again concentrated on his writing and relocated to New York City. He would resurrect The Deviants name for occasional live performances, such as in February 1984 when he teamed up with Wayne Kramer and Wallis' band which featured Sanderson and drummer George Butler. This set was released as Human Garbage. In 2002, a new line-up of the band (featuring bassist Doug Lunn, drummer Rick Parnell and vocalist Michael Simmons) released Dr. Crow. Farren then continued to perform and record sporadically under the name The Deviants, using a pool of musicians which include Andy Colquhoun and former Blodwyn Pig saxophonist Jack Lancaster. Eating Jello With A Heated Fork was released in 1996, credited to Deviants IXVI, followed by 2002's Dr Crow. On 25 June 2011, after returning to live in the UK, Farren performed on the 'Spirit of 71' stage at Glastonbury Festival with 'The Last Men Standing'. The band included Andy Colquhoun and the Deviants late-1960s rhythm section of Sanderson and Hunter. During a rare performance by The Deviants at The Borderline in Central London on 27 July 2013, Farren collapsed on stage. He died later in hospital. ==Discography== *1967 ‚Äì Ptooff! *1968 ‚Äì Disposable *1969 ‚Äì The Deviants 3 *1977 - Screwed Up E.P.

The museum is one of several regimental museums that form part of Winchester's Military Museums. ==History== The museum brings together the collections of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (which had been at Cowley Barracks); renamed 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) from 7 November 1958, the King's Royal Rifle Corps (which had been at Peninsula Barracks) and the Rifle Brigade (which had also been at Peninsula Barracks). These regiments went on to form the Green Jackets Brigade in 1958 and the Royal Green Jackets Regiment in 1966. It was opened by the Queen, the regiment's former Colonel in Chief, in December 1989. ==Collections== Diorama and campaign medals The exhibition, entitled ‚ÄúWith the Rifles to Waterloo‚Äù, opened in 2015 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, is focused on the Napoleonic Wars.

He is the 10th son of Prince Yi Kang, the fifth son of Emperor Gojong of Korea, and one of his partners, Lady Hong Ch≈èng-sun, a former telephone operator. In his earlier life, Yi gained fame as a singer, the \\"singing prince\\", with a 1967 album \\"Pigeon House\\".42ÎÖÑÎßåÏóê ÏùåÎ∞ò ÎÇ¥Îäî Ìô©ÏÜê Ïù¥ÏÑùÏî®, Chosun Ilbo, 2009.01.21. Since 2004, he has been employed by the city of Jeonju to promote tourism, and he is also a professor of history at Jeonju University. As an activist on monarchy restoration, Yi Seok promotes his concept regarding the creation of a constitutional monarchy while co-existing with the Presidential system, making the restoration of the Imperial family as a symbolic existence.There are examples of the Presidential system co-existing with the Imperial family. In Romania, the style of the former monarch, \\"His Majesty\\", is recognized by the republic government. Also, in Wallis and Futuna, a series of islands belongs to France, kingdoms still exist.As such, Yi Seok founded an organization \\"Korean Imperial Family Cultural Foundation\\" (Ìô©Ïã§Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Îã®) in August 2006. Yi Seok's guesthouse, as well as his residence, \\"SeungKwangJae\\" (ÏäπÍ¥ëÏû¨) in Jeonju Hanok Village, was once visited by the former president Roh Moo-hyun, the President Moon Jae-in with his wife, as well as Park Won-soon (the Mayor of Seoul) and Harry B. Harris Jr. In May 2016, Yi Seok became the brand ambassador of the Liancourt Rocks by Ulleung County. == Biography == ===Early life=== Sadong Palace in 1937 Yi Seok was born in Korea under Japanese rule, on 30 August 1941. By the time, his father Yi Kang was already 62 while his mother, Lady Hong was 19. The place he was born, Sadong Palace (ÏÇ¨ÎèôÍ∂Å), was lost after 1945. The rising of the Syngman Rhee government also caused many of their family properties to be confiscated. After the outbreak of the Korean War, Yi Seok and his family had to leave their residence in Samcheong-dong and lived in poverty. At the beginning of the era of Republic of Korea, the Imperial family was banished from the Imperial palace, but their life became better after the president Park Chung Hee gained power. When studying Hankook University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, Yi Seok learned foreign languages, principally Spanish, as well as foreign relations and history, becoming fluent in them, and he prepared himself for the diplomatic service. A series of coup d'√©tat and civil discord rendered that impossible. Meanwhile, he had an talent for entertaining, becoming a well known singer and professional musician in the 1960s while in his twenties, having several hit songs. Later, Yi Seok volunteered for the Korean military and served as an enlisted man in the Vietnam War. During the war, Yi Seok wounded and needed to return to Korea, and around the same time, his mother died of stomach cancer. Yi Seok was then 26 and attempted suicide for nine times. After President Park was assassinated in 1979, the subsidy from the government is discontinued, and Yi Seok tried various jobs to support himself. In 1980s, he moved to the United States as an illegal immigrant, doing jobs including lawn mowing, cleaning swimming pools and buildings. At the same time, he attempted to retrieve family properties seized by the republic, which is now irretrievable under post-war Korean law. With the changing political climate in the early 1990s, Yi Seok returned to Korea. Yi Seok's past was made into a dramatic semi-fictional TV programme on the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS). ===Recent activities=== In April 2004, his eldest daughter, Yi Hong performed for the first time in a singing show from SBS, and Yi Seok starred on stage with her as celebration. By August of the same year, Yi Seok started to run a guesthouse \\"SeungKwangJae\\" (ÏäπÍ¥ëÏû¨) in Jeonju Hanok Village, which is also his current residence. The name reference of the guesthouse is the era name of Emperor Gojong, Kwangmu (ÂÖâÊ≠¶), and seung (Ïäπ) stands for \\"succession\\". In fact, \\"SeungKwangJae\\" is a place rent by the government of Jeonju and it was built in wood similar to the traditional way and Yi Seok runs the place with his supporters. He said, \\"There are many things to do in Jeonju since this is where the Joseon dynasty founded. I'm going to spread the culture of the royal family and re-illuminate Jeonju's history.\\" On 16 July 2005, Yi Seok's cousin Yi Ku passed away without an heir, and the Jeonju Lee Royal Family Association announced, on July 22, that Yi Won would become Yi Ku's successor according to his will. During the funeral, Yi Seok was angered by the decision and commented that \\"the funeral is yet ended, and it's inappropriate to discuss about adopting an heir by now\\". Later, Yi Seok claimed that \\"adopting a son after death doesn‚Äôt make any sense,\\" and he also claimed that Yi Bangja, his late aunt and the mother of Yi Ku, named him as \\"first successor\\" in her will. In August 2006, for the purpose of monarchy restoration, Yi Seok founded the organization \\"Korean Imperial Family Cultural Foundation\\" (Ìô©Ïã§Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Îã®) and acted as its director. On the other hand, Yi Hae-won, one of his elder half-sisters, self-proclaimed as an empress and held a coronation on 29 September 2006; Yi Seok was invited but he didn't attend the ceremony. Statue of King Sejong in Gwanghwamun Plaza, Seoul The Statue of King Sejong in Gwanghwamun Plaza was erected on 9 October 2009, and Yi Seok attended the unveiling ceremony. According to a talk on 4 September 2014, Yi Seok revealed that there's no existing contemporary portrait of Sejong the Great, and the appearance of the statue was based on the faces of Yi Seok himself and that from the portrait of Grand Prince Hyoryeong, King Sejong's older brother, which is now preserved at Gwanaksan. On 7 August 2018, Harry B. Harris Jr., the United States Ambassador to South Korea, paid a visit to SeungKwangJae. The mayor of Jeonju, Kim Seung-su (ÍπÄÏäπÏàò), said, \\"The prince [Yi Seok] is our history and our spirit. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the ambassadors for visiting this symbolic space.\\" On October 6, 2018, Yi declared Andrew Lee, a distant Korean-American relative and an entrepreneur, to be the \\"Korean Crown Prince\\". == Family == After divorcing with his previous four ex-wives, Yi Seok's current spouse is said to be 18 years younger than him. In his previous marriages, he has two daughters: * Yi Hong (Ïù¥Ìôç, born 1974): Works as an actress in Korea. She married Han Yeong-gwang (ÌïúÏòÅÍ¥ë), an actor as well from Korea, having a daughter born in 2001. * Yi Jin (Ïù¥ÏßÑ, born 1979): Works on the promotion of traditional Korean ceramic arts.

They have close ties to the Lun Bawang. The elevation there is slightly over 1,200 meters. In the past, because there were few roads (only poorly maintained logging roads, which tended not to be too close to the Bario Highlands) and because the area was largely inaccessible by river because of rapids, the highlands and the Kelabit were relatively untouched by modern western influences. Now, however, there is a relatively permanent road route on which it is possible to reach Bario by car from Miri. The road is marked but driving without a local guide is not advisable, as it takes over 11 hours of driving to reach Bario from Miri through many logging trail junctions and river crossings. With a population of approximately 6,600 people (2013) the Kelabit comprise one of the smallest ethnic groups in Sarawak. Many have migrated to urban areas over the last 20 years and it is estimated that only 1,200 still live in their remote homeland. There, tightly knit communities live in inherited longhouses and practice a generations-old form of agriculture. Hunting and fishing is also practised. Domesticated buffalo are valued highly, seven of which are traditionally required for the dowry for an upper class bride. ==Etymology== Three native Kelabit women, 1922. The name of the people comes from the local word, \\"na labid\\"; where the name of people originated from the name of Labid River. Also, other people group names such as Lun Bawang, Lun Dayeh or Southern Muruts are often associated with the Kelabit people. The Kelabit people belong to the Dayak people (it is a large ethnic group of closely related people groups that includes about 200 tribes). With a population of approximately 6,600, the Kelabit people are the smallest people group in the state of Sarawak. ==History== During the Second World War the Kelabit, like other natives of Borneo, were co-opted by the Allies into fighting the Japanese. The English academic Tom Harrisson led the Semut I operations (one of four Semut operations in the area), which parachuted into their midst in 1945 to make contact; they were supplied with weapons by the Australian military and played an essential role in the liberation of Borneo. ==Religion== After the Second World War the Kelabit people received visits from Christian missionaries of the Borneo Evangelical Mission. The Kelabit are now predominantly Christian. Prior to conversion they had a custom of erecting megaliths and digging ditches in honour of notable individuals. As the Kelabit people began to Christianize in the early 20th century, so did the process of ethnic consolidation were also intensified. ==Language== The Kelabit people uses Latin script that were introduced to the island by the colonialist from Europe. The Kelabit language belongs to the North Bornean branch of the Western Malayo-Polynesian languages. The Kelabit language is used in one of the most remote areas of the Borneo island in the Bario highlands of Kalimantan and northern Sarawak. There are several dialects in the Kelabitic languages such as Lepu Potng, Padas, Trusan and so on. ==Culture== Kelabit woman's tattoo, 1912. ===Family=== There is a strict order (rule) of inheritance, which includes the need for one person to organize expensive commemorative celebrations (perhaps, a wake) for people who inherit from them. The conflict between older brothers and sisters can be particularly noticeable in connection with these circumstances. In any case, the Kelabit family is a cooperating unit. Adults are called lun merar, which literally means \\"big people\\". In order to attain adulthood, one must have three things:- # A spouse, with whom one would grow rice together # Children # Rice, with which one would be able to feed their children and grandchildren In rural communities there is a division of castes namely, the nobility, the ordinary community members and the descendants of those who were in slavery. The leader always comes from the nobility. He must have things that are regarded as special prestige among the Kelabit people. These are ancient items of Chinese origin such as, porcelain vases, beads or gongs, as well as items that are made from pearls. ===Settlements=== Kelabit villages usually include only one longhouse, in which all the inhabitants of the community would live in. A longhouse can stretch as long as 75 meters in length. Such house does not have partitions that divides into rooms. ===Clothing=== All Kelabit women are tattooed when they reach the age of 16. Bold zigzag bands are traced on the forearm, not completely encircling the limb, and strikingly decorative geometrical designs are tattooed on the thigh, the shin, and sometimes, on the knee-cap. They wear strings of large blue beads around the waist and wrist, and necklaces of smaller beads. 1922. In traditional society, men wear traditional loincloths, and the women would wear skirt made of Tapa cloth (material from the inside of the tree bark). Some would prefer Westernized clothing. The custom of tattooing and dulling of teeth have also become less prevalent. ===Cuisine=== Rice, for the Kelabit people, symbolizes the true human food. Kelabit people mainly eat rice, and also additionally meat, fruits, vegetables, corn and sugar cane. Traditional Kelabit cuisine are such as:- * Nubak Layak, mashed rice wrapped in Isip leaf. * Manuk Pansuh / Pansoh, seasoned chicken cooked in bamboo. * Udung Ubih, tapioca leaves stir-fried with lemongrass. * A'beng, de-boned fish. * Pa‚Äôuh Ab‚Äôpa, fish cooked in brinjal, cucumber and black fungus soup. * Labo Senutuq, shredded beef stir- fried with bamboo shoots and Kantan flower salad. ===Festivals=== * Bario Food and Culture Festival (Irau Nukenen Bario) 2019 dates are 25th, 26th, 27 July ===Traditional activities=== Kelabit blacksmith in Sarawak, Malaysia, circa 1896. Pottery, blacksmithing and wood carving are all traditional crafts of Kelabit people. The form of the stone adze (chopping tools) of the Kelabit differs noticeably from the types previously recorded in Southeast Asia; where its 'quadrangular' is from Malaysia, and there is no 'round ax'. Also traditional occupation of the Kelabit people includes needle-working. There are 69 items with pearls (necklaces, hats and belts) decorations. Pearl jewelry is a sign of prestige, just like Chinese porcelain vases. Necklaces are worn by both men and women, while headdresses are exclusively for women. Kelabit people are interested in precious stones. Earlier before they became Christians, Kelabit people had stone amulets. Agriculture is a traditional occupation of the Kelabit people. ==Livelihood and economy== The traditional occupation of Kelabit people is agriculture. The main cultivar is rice. They distinguish between wet paddy field and dried paddy field. In the north of the Bario Highlands, there are only wet paddy field areas. In other parts of the Highlands, dried paddy field areas have also been made, as well as other crops that have also been planted in these paddy field areas. The Kelabit people are also cultivators of maize, tapioca, pineapple, pumpkin, cucumber, beans, coffee, lemon grass, taro and various fruit like passion fruit and strawberry. Livestock development is limited. Meat is a special problem, as traditionally the Kelabit people used it only for sacrifices, and even today almost no animals are slaughtered for daily consumption (since, at present, there are still many Kelabit people who are adherents of traditional beliefs). Subsequently, they began to raise animals for dairy products and meat. The forest is the main source of wild fruits and vegetables. Forest gathering, hunting and fishing are common. Kelabit people engages in salt extraction; which plays a significant role in their economy. With salt, they would exchange from other people for their own necessities. ==Notable people== * Alena Murang - Kuching-born artist, dancer, musician, teacher, activist, social entrepreneur and cultural ambassador. She is of Kelabit-English-Italian descent. * Hannah Tan - Penang-born singer-songwriter, model and actress. She is of Chinese-Kelabit descent. * Idris Jala \\\\- former Malaysian minister. * Kuda Ditta (1937-2003) - Former Olympian and policeman. * Ngalinuh Bala - Former policeman and recipient of Grand Knight of Valour (Darjah Kebesaran Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa), for his gallantry during the Communist insurgent attack. == References == == External links == *The eBario and Bario Infopages *A Brief Profile: The Kelabit of the Kelabit Highlands *The Bario Kelabit Language Wiki Category:Ethnic groups in Indonesia Category:Ethnic groups in Sarawak Category:Dayak people Category:Headhunting ","title":"Kelabit people"},{"id":"1433010","text":"Cathedral Parkway‚Äì110th Street is a local station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. It is located in the Upper West Side and Morningside Heights, Manhattan, at West 110th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard at the northwest corner of Central Park. The station is served by the B on weekdays, the C train at all times except nights, and the A train during late nights only. ==History== The station opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND)'s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street. Construction of the whole line cost $191.2 million. While the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line already provided parallel service, the new Eighth Avenue subway via Central Park West and Frederick Douglass Boulevard provided an alternative route. Under the 2015‚Äì2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station underwent a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative and was entirely closed for several months. Updates included cellular service, Wi- Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps. A request for proposals for the 72nd Street, 86th Street, Cathedral Parkway‚Äì110th Street, and 163rd Street‚ÄìAmsterdam Avenue stations was issued on June 1, 2017, and the New York City Transit and Bus Committee officially recommended that the MTA Board award the $111 million contract to ECCO III Enterprises in October 2017. As part of the renovations, the station was closed from April 9, 2018 to September 2, 2018. The southbound platform opened first, on September 2, followed by the northbound platform on September 4. ==Station layout== This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The platforms have no trim line, but the name tablets read \\"110TH STREET CATHEDRAL P'KWAY.\\" on white lettering in two lines. They are written on a dark blue background and black border. Black I-beam columns run at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. Toward the southern end of the station, the northbound express track descends below the other three tracks of the Eighth Avenue Line. At the south end of the station, two staircases from each platform go up to a mezzanine above the tracks that allows a free transfer between directions. There was a crossunder at the 110th Street exits, but it closed in 1992. The artwork at the station, installed in 1999, is called Migrations by Christopher Wynter in memory of Athie L. Wynter. It has three different areas of mosaic panels, two on each platform and one on the full-time mezzanine. As part of the 2018 renovation, this artwork was expanded. ===Exits=== This station's full-time entrance/exit is at the south end, serving 109th Street. From the mezzanine above the tracks at the south end of the station, a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the system. Outside of fare control, there is a token booth and two staircases to the street. The southbound platform has an additional same-level entrance/exit at the north end, serving 110th Street.

The show has aired on NBC since 1975. After a disastrous 1994‚Äì95 season featuring a mix of old and new characters, Michaels decided to once again revamp the cast, keeping only five cast members and hiring six. The 1995‚Äì96 season once again saved the show from cancellation, introducing a new era of Saturday Night Live characters and sketches that were highly popular with audiences. This cast stayed mostly stable until the 1998‚Äì99 season, which added cast members such as Jimmy Fallon and Horatio Sanz. These two would pave the way for the next era of Saturday Night Live in the early 2000s. ==Rebuilding effort (1995‚Äì1996)== The 1995‚Äì96 season almost completely rebuilt the cast with new members Jim Breuer, Will Ferrell, Darrell Hammond, David Koechner, Cheri Oteri, Nancy Walls, Chris Kattan, Colin Quinn, and Fred Wolf. The only holdovers from the previous season were Norm Macdonald, Mark McKinney, Tim Meadows, Molly Shannon and David Spade. The larger-than-usual number of new hires was part of a rebuilding effort from the 1994‚Äì95 season, a season that executive producer Lorne Michaels acknowledged was \\"incredibly difficult\\". Lenny Pickett also took over for G.E. Smith as leader of the Saturday Night Live Band. Of the cast members held over from the previous season, only Meadows and Spade were actual veterans. The other three were still newcomers to the show. Macdonald had a few bit parts in his first year (the 1993‚Äì94 season) and was the anchor of \\"Weekend Update\\" (a satirical news sketch performed during every episode) during the 1994‚Äì95 season, his performance considered a high point in a season widely considered lackluster. Shannon appeared in early 1995 as a featured performer after Janeane Garofalo quit the show; McKinney began in early 1995 as well, but as a contract player, having gained much experience in televised sketch comedy as a veteran of Canadian variety show The Kids in the Hall, also produced by Lorne Michaels. David Spade became the longest-serving cast member during this season. Fred Wolf, a writer for the show since 1991, would also serve a brief run as a featured player during this season and the next. The new cast members quickly made an impression and revitalised the show. Hammond in particular quickly built up a repertoire of popular impersonations, including Bill Clinton and Chris Matthews. ===Cast=== *Jim Breuer *Will Ferrell *Darrell Hammond *David Koechner *Norm Macdonald* *Mark McKinney *Tim Meadows *Cheri Oteri *Molly Shannon *David Spade *Nancy Walls Featuring *Chris Kattan (first episode: March 16, 1996) *Colin Quinn (first episode credited: March 16, 1996) *Fred Wolf (first episode: April 13, 1996) * denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor ==Cast stabilisation (1996‚Äì1997)== The ensemble from the 1995‚Äì96 season was mostly unchanged for the 1996‚Äì97 season, save for the firing of David Koechner and Nancy Walls, as well as the departure of David Spade. Tim Meadows became the longest-running cast member this season. Tracy Morgan and Ana Gasteyer both joined the cast, taking the places of Koechner and Walls. Mark McKinney left at the end of this season. ===Cast=== *Jim Breuer *Will Ferrell *Ana Gasteyer *Darrell Hammond *Chris Kattan *Norm Macdonald* *Mark McKinney *Tim Meadows *Tracy Morgan *Cheri Oteri *Molly Shannon Featuring *Colin Quinn *Fred Wolf (final episode: October 19, 1996) * denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor ==Period of (1997‚Äì1998)== The ensemble from the 1996‚Äì97 season remained substantially unchanged for the 1997‚Äì98 season. Jim Breuer would leave the show after this season, later blaming then-head writer Adam McKay, although McKay denies the allegations. This is also the only season of the show in which the intro is not based on New York City (instead, just showing colored bars and black-and-white pictures of the cast, musical guests, hosts, special guests, and announcement for Robert Smigel's \\"TV Funhouse\\" animated sketches). ===Norm Macdonald's firing=== While the cast was, for the most part, unchanged from the previous season, Norm Macdonald's surprise firing was the source of much speculation and scrutiny from the media. Macdonald frequently targeted O. J. Simpson and his murder trial on \\"Weekend Update\\", a recurring joke that then-NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer apparently disliked. This is rumoured to be the cause of Macdonald's firing, although Ohlmeyer denied the allegations. He was replaced on Weekend Update by castmate Colin Quinn starting January 10, 1998. ===Cast=== *Jim Breuer *Will Ferrell *Ana Gasteyer *Darrell Hammond *Chris Kattan *Norm Macdonald* (final episode: March 14, 1998) *Tim Meadows *Tracy Morgan *Cheri Oteri *Colin Quinn* *Molly Shannon * denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor ==New featured players (1998‚Äì1999)== The 1998‚Äì99 season introduced new cast members Jimmy Fallon, Chris Parnell and Horatio Sanz. ===Cast=== *Will Ferrell *Ana Gasteyer *Darrell Hammond *Chris Kattan *Tim Meadows *Tracy Morgan *Cheri Oteri *Colin Quinn* *Molly Shannon Featuring *Jimmy Fallon *Chris Parnell *Horatio Sanz * denotes \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor ==Cast shake-up (1999‚Äì2000)== The 1999‚Äì2000 season would be the last for Colin Quinn, Cheri Oteri, and long-time cast member Tim Meadows. Meadows (who was a cast member for 10 seasons) held the record as the longest-tenured cast member, a record surpassed from Kevin Nealon (who stayed on for nine seasons), however, castmate Darrell Hammond later surpassed him as the longest-tenured cast member during his 10th season. Meadows was also the longest-serving African-American cast member and would remain so for the next 13 years before he would eventually be surpassed by Kenan Thompson in the 2012‚Äì13 season.

Although Pet Engine broke up in early 2003, they were briefly reunited when they played at Summerfest 2006. ==Discography== *Hearts And Bones And Voices (1994) *Musicalbum EP (1995) *Feeling Like a Hundred Bucks (Don't Records, 1997)Album review, Allmusic *Megahurtz (Don't Records, 2000) ==Compilations== *Uncharted - 1991 (as \\"Blackfish\\") *Son of Uncharted - 1993 (as \\"Blackfish\\") *Made In Wisconsin - 1997 *Gag Me With A Spoon - 1994 * Aware Records The Compilation Vol. 8- 2000 ==Members== *Steve Ziel - Vocals/Guitar *Clem Blanding - Bass *Al Hildebrand - Guitar *Micah Havertape - Drums ==Past members== Dan Andera - Drums (1993-1996) Matt Schroeder - Guitar (1990-1994) Dan Schroeder - Drums (1990 - 1992) ==References== Category:Alternative rock groups from Wisconsin Category:Musical groups from Wisconsin ","title":"Pet Engine"},{"id":"1433030","text":"Saturday Night Live is an American sketch comedy series created and produced by Lorne Michaels for most of the show's run. The show has aired on NBC since 1975. The 1990‚Äì91 season brought the first major changes to the show's cast in over four years, adding cast members such as Chris Farley and David Spade. As the previous cast slowly left, the new players began to take over. With most of the older cast gone, Michaels attempted to push a mix of old (Kevin Nealon, Mike Myers) and new (Janeane Garofalo, Michael McKean) for the 1994‚Äì95 season's cast. This season is widely considered one of the show's worst (along with the 1980‚Äì81 and 1985‚Äì86 seasons). After this cast, Michaels replaced most of the cast with unknowns for the 1995‚Äì96 season, once again saving the show from cancellation. ==Transition in progress (1990‚Äì1991)== The 1990‚Äì91 season was a transitional year. Jon Lovitz and Nora Dunn left the show after the previous season, the latter in a cloud of controversy. Lorne Michaels introduced a number of players who quickly became stars on the show: Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Julia Sweeney. Memorable characters and sketches introduced by the new cast members from this period included Sweeney's \\"Pat\\", Sandler's \\"Opera Man\\" and \\"Canteen Boy\\", Farley's \\"Matt Foley\\", Schneider's annoying office geek \\"The Copy Guy\\", Rock's black perspective talk show host \\"Nat X\\", and Spade's caustic commentary piece \\"Hollywood Minute\\". The popularity of these new cast members helped to offset the departure of several popular long-time players over the first two seasons of this era, including Jan Hooks and \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor Dennis Miller after this season, as well as Victoria Jackson after the following season. The remaining cast members of the \\"older\\" cast (Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Mike Myers and Kevin Nealon) also remained popular with audiences. Nealon succeeded Miller as \\"Weekend Update\\" anchor. For the remainder of his tenure, Nealon found himself playing the straight man during \\"Update\\" and other sketches, particularly against the newer cast members. His participation in that role increased after Carvey, Hartman, and Myers left the show. Myers introduced many popular new characters during this period, including Linda Richman, host of a talk show \\"Coffee Talk\\". Meanwhile, Hartman, who had impersonated President Ronald Reagan on the show, began appearing regularly with his impression of Democratic candidate and soon-to-be President Bill Clinton. Carvey's impersonations of President George H.W. Bush remained an audience favourite, and Carvey also developed a popular impression of independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. In the period leading up to the 1992 presidential election, Carvey and Hartman dominated the show with these impressions, creating mock debates. The Myers and Carvey characters Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar from the \\"Wayne's World\\" sketch would become household names during the early 1990s following the release of the successful feature film, Wayne's World. ==Season Breakdown== Of the new cast members of the show, Chris Farley was not afraid to trade on his size for laughs. In one sketch he played a shirtless dancer, opposite the trim and muscular Dirty Dancing star Patrick Swayze, as they competed in an audition for a position with the Chippendales male dance troupe. Sandler and Farley also did a song called \\"Lunch Lady Land\\", with Farley dancing while dressed up as a lunch lady. Another recurring Farley character was the manic, thrice-divorced motivational speaker Matt Foley, whose schtick consisted mainly of yelling at and whining to his clients about having to live \\"in a van down by the river\\", and hurling himself around the room, demolishing everything in sight. Farley was fired from the show in 1995, but went on to star in successful movies like Tommy Boy and Black Sheep with David Spade, and Beverly Hills Ninja with Chris Rock and Nicollette Sheridan. ===1993‚Äì1994 season=== After the end of the 1993‚Äì1994 season, having already lost star cast member Dana Carvey, who left midway through the previous season, SNL's 1994 post-season saw more departures. Julia Sweeney left due to frustration and burnout. Another departure was that of Phil Hartman, whose final moment on the show was at the end of a musical number, with the entire cast singing a parody of the \\"So Long, Farewell\\" song from The Sound of Music. After all of the cast had left the stage, Farley, in his Matt Foley character, was left sitting on the stage, with Phil walking back on stage, cuddling next to Farley to sing goodbye and waving at the audience. Producer Lorne Michaels hired a number of new cast members, beginning midway through the 1993‚Äì1994 season. ===1994‚Äì1995 season=== Similar to his decision in the mid-1980s to bring in established actors Randy Quaid, Joan Cusack and Robert Downey, Jr., Michaels added Michael McKean, and later Chris Elliott, to the cast. Both left at the end of the 1994‚Äì1995 season. Later acquisitions were sketch veteran Mark McKinney of the recently wrapped, Michaels-produced Canadian sketch comedy show The Kids in the Hall, and stand-up comic Janeane Garofalo, the latter of whom joined at the beginning of the 1994‚Äì1995 season, and the former joining in January, shortly before the departure of Mike Myers. Garofalo left in mid-season, replaced by Molly Shannon. Myers also left in mid-season, as would Nealon after season's end. Farley and Sandler left at the end of the season. Longtime featured player Jay Mohr left as well, and Al Franken, who had worked on the show as a writer and featured player on and off since 1975, left at season's end as well. British actress Morwenna Banks joined the cast for the last four episodes of the season as a full cast member, but did not return the next season. Much like season 6 [1980-1981] (or, to a lesser extent, season 11 [1985-1986]), season 20 [1994-1995] is considered one of SNL's worst-received seasons. The season was home to many cast turnovers and much dissension. Janeane Garofalo left the show halfway through the season. Mike Myers departed to pursue a movie career. Longtime feature player Al Franken quit, Ellen Cleghorne, Kevin Nealon, Chris Elliott, and Michael McKean also quit the show as well. Laura Kightlinger left to join Roseanne Barr's ill-fated FOX comedy series Saturday Night Special. Morwenna Banks, Chris Farley, Jay Mohr, and Adam Sandler were fired. Banks was hired as a contract player for the last four episodes of the season, leaving behind no memorable characters or celebrity impersonations. Towards the end of the 1994‚Äì1995 season on SNL the show was in a state of turmoil, with the show enacting the highest turnover rate going into the next season. The 1994‚Äì1995 season had a total of 14 cast members; only five remained for the 1995‚Äì1996 season: Molly Shannon, Mark McKinney, Norm Macdonald, David Spade and Tim Meadows. ===Season breakdown=== ====1990‚Äì1991 season==== ===Cast=== * Dana Carvey * Phil Hartman * Jan Hooks * Victoria Jackson * Dennis Miller * Mike Myers * Kevin Nealon With * Chris Farley * Tim Meadows (debut: February 9, 1991) * Chris Rock * Julia Sweeney (debut: November 10, 1990) Featuring * A.

Miller is also the first Weekend Update anchor to last more than five seasons. The only other anchors to pass the five-year mark are Tina Fey (who became the first female anchor to stay on for more than five years), Seth Meyers (who broke Miller's record in 2012), Colin Jost (who took over for Meyers in the middle of Season 39), and Michael Che (Jost's co-anchor who came on the following season). *Hartman was to leave along with Miller and Jan Hooks, but stayed on after NBC convinced him to stay with the proposal of his own sketch comedy show. The show was scrapped but Hartman was fine with it because he would be \\"sweating blood to make the show work\\", according to him. *This season is the debut of the \\"Bad Boys\\", who would begin to achieve prominence around 1992‚Äì1993. Adam Sandler appears in three episodes (December 8, 1990, December 15, 1990 and January 12, 1991) as an uncredited extra prior to his official debut on the February 9, 1991 episode, alongside Tim Meadows. David Spade appears in nearly every live broadcast throughout Season 16 but does not appear in the opening credits. *Dennis Miller and Jan Hooks left the show at the end of the season. *This is the first season since the 1985‚Äì86 season to hire African-American cast members and the first time that two African-American males (Tim Meadows and Chris Rock) were cast. ===1991‚Äì1992 season=== ===Cast=== * Dana Carvey * Chris Farley * Phil Hartman * Victoria Jackson * Mike Myers * Kevin Nealon * Chris Rock * Julia Sweeney With * Ellen Cleghorne * Siobhan Fallon * Tim Meadows * Adam Sandler * Rob Schneider * David Spade Featuring * Beth Cahill (debut: November 16, 1991) * Al Franken * Melanie Hutsell (debut: November 16, 1991) * Robert Smigel ==== Notes ==== *The 1991‚Äì1992 season boasted the largest cast in the history of the series, but it was broken in season 46 with 20 cast members. The season also sets the record for most female performers, a record that would later be broken in the 2013‚Äì2014 season (season 39), with seven women (Aidy Bryant, Vanessa Bayer, Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Noel Wells, Nasim Pedrad, and Sasheer Zamata). *Chris Farley, Chris Rock and Julia Sweeney were upgraded to contract status. *Victoria Jackson left at the end of the season, as the longest-serving female cast member in SNL history, a record broken by Molly Shannon in 2001, while short-lived cast members Beth Cahill and Siobhan Fallon are fired. *Ellen Cleghorne becomes the first African-American female cast member hired in six years and the third one hired overall (after Yvonne Hudson and Danitra Vance). ====1992‚Äì1993 season==== On October 3, at the end of her second song, a cover of Bob Marley's song \\"War\\", musical guest Sin√©ad O'Connor created controversy by holding up a picture of Pope John Paul II, exclaiming, \\"Fight the real enemy\\", and tearing the picture to pieces. According to the book Live From New York, this was unrehearsed, and condemned by Michaels and the SNL crew, who refused to light the applause sign after O'Connor's performance; likewise, guest host Tim Robbins, who was raised Catholic, did not thank O'Connor during the closing. ===Cast=== * Dana Carvey (final episode: February 6, 1993) * Chris Farley * Phil Hartman * Mike Myers * Kevin Nealon * Chris Rock * Rob Schneider * Julia Sweeney Featuring * Ellen Cleghorne * Melanie Hutsell * Tim Meadows * Adam Sandler * David Spade With * Al Franken * Robert Smigel ==== Notes ==== *Mike Myers was absent for the first several episodes of the season. *Rob Schneider ascended to contract status. *Melanie Hutsell was promoted to the middle category. *Robert Smigel and Chris Rock leave the show at the end of the season. Smigel would go on to The Dana Carvey Show and Late Night with Conan O'Brien (though Robert Smigel would return as a writer for the \\"TV Funhouse\\" cartoon segments on SNL), while Rock would guest star on In Living Color's final season before concentrating on standup comedy and film appearances. ====1993‚Äì1994 season==== ===Cast=== * Ellen Cleghorne * Chris Farley * Phil Hartman * Melanie Hutsell * Michael McKean (debut: March 12, 1994) * Tim Meadows * Mike Myers * Kevin Nealon * Adam Sandler * Rob Schneider * David Spade * Julia Sweeney Featuring * Al Franken * Norm Macdonald (debut: October 2, 1993) * Jay Mohr (debut: October 9, 1993) * Sarah Silverman (debut: October 9, 1993) ==== Hosts and musical guests ==== One host during this season, Martin Lawrence, had an opening monologue which included an extended series of comments about feminine hygiene. The syndicated version of the episode replaces the offending section of the monologue with a graphic (read by an off-screen announcer, SNL writer Jim Downey) describing in vague terms what Lawrence had said and noting that it had almost cost SNL employees their jobs. Lawrence was subsequently banned from appearing on SNL again. ==== Notes ==== *Ellen Cleghorne, Melanie Hutsell, Tim Meadows, Adam Sandler and David Spade were all promoted to full-time cast member status. *Nealon ends the season by handing \\"Weekend Update\\" over to Norm Macdonald and kissing him on the mouth. *Phil Hartman and Julia Sweeney left at the end of the season, while Melanie Hutsell, Rob Schneider, and Sarah Silverman were fired. ====1994‚Äì1995 season==== ===Cast=== * Morwenna Banks (debut: April 8, 1995) * Ellen Cleghorne * Chris Elliott * Chris Farley * Janeane Garofalo (final: February 25, 1995) * Norm Macdonald * Michael McKean * Mark McKinney (debut: January 14, 1995) * Tim Meadows * Mike Myers (final episode: January 21, 1995) * Kevin Nealon * Adam Sandler * David Spade Featuring * Al Franken (final: May 6, 1995) * Laura Kightlinger * Jay Mohr * Molly Shannon (debut: February 25, 1995) ==== Notes ==== *In his book, Gasping for Airtime, Jay Mohr mentions that at the end of the season, he demanded a promotion to cast member, among other things, and the network procrastinated on answering his demand throughout the summer of 1995 until he finally quit outright. However, this has been disproved when it was revealed that Mohr was fired due to confessing that he plagiarized jokes for sketches. *During this season, Kevin Nealon became the show's longest-tenured cast member, as he had been in the cast for nearly a decade - from 1986 to 1995. **Also, with Mike Myers' departure, he became the last cast member who was hired in the 1980s to leave the show. *Molly Shannon joined the cast as a midseason replacement for Mike Myers (who left the show so he can star in movies) and Janeane Garofalo (who quit out of disgust over dealing with the cast and crew) in February 1995, eight months before she was promoted to a contract player in SNL's 21st season (1995‚Äì1996). *In the prime time special Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation (a documentary on how Saturday Night Live survived the 1990s), it was revealed that, because of this season's less-than-stellar reception, NBC was seriously considering firing Lorne Michaels and canceling the show (making this the third time this show has come close to being canceled, joining two other tumultuous and critically lackluster seasons: season 6 [1980-1981] and season 11 [1985-1986]). The firings and turnover resulting from this season represented the biggest involvement into the show's affairs by NBC executives since season 6 and the largest cast overhaul since season 11. ==References== *1990 Saturday Night Live history 1990 Category:1990s in American television ","title":"History of Saturday Night Live (1990‚Äì1995)"},{"id":"1433039","text":"right Harlaxton House, Toowoomba, Queensland, 2014 A veranda or verandah is a roofed, open-air gallery or porch, attached to the outside of a building. A veranda is often partly enclosed by a railing and frequently extends across the front and sides of the structure. Although the form verandah is correct and very common, some authorities prefer the version without an \\"h\\" (the Concise Oxford English Dictionary gives the \\"h\\" version as a variant and The Guardian Style Guide says \\"veranda not verandah\\"). The Guardian Style Guide == Architecture styles notable for verandas == ===Australia=== Winifred Rawson tending her son on the veranda of The Hollow, near Mackay, Queensland, ~1873 A heritage listed building in Hungary The veranda has featured quite prominently in Australian vernacular architecture and first became widespread in colonial buildings during the 1850s. The Victorian Filigree architecture style is used by residential (particularly terraced houses in Australia and New Zealand) and commercial buildings (particularly hotels) across Australia and features decorative screens of wrought iron, cast iron \\"lace\\" or wood fretwork. The Queenslander is a style of residential construction in Queensland, Australia, which is adapted to subtropical climates and characterized in part by its large verandas, which sometimes encircle the entire house. ===Brazil=== The bandeirista style house from Brazil typically has a veranda positioned to face the sunrise. ===Japan=== In regions with heavy snowfall , especially Aomori and Niigata Prefectures, structures are developed called Gangi-Zukuri (:ja:ÈõÅÊú®ÈÄ†) since Edo period. For example, The total length of Gangi in old Takada city is over 16 Kilometers.Gangi Dori (covered walkways) Joetsu Information Web Site === Poland === In Poland, the word \\"weranda\\" is commonly used for the unheated roofed annex to a house, without walls or with glass walls. ===United States=== The Creole townhouse in New Orleans, Louisiana, is also noted for its prominent use of verandas. In fact, most houses constructed in the Southern United States before the advent of air conditioning were built with a covered front porch or veranda. Spanish Colonial architecture (as well as the \\"Mission style\\" revivalist version that became popular in the Western United States in the early 1900s) commonly incorporates verandas, both on the exterior of buildings and, in cases of buildings with courtyards, along the interior walls of courtyards. In some cases, homes were constructed with every room opening into a courtyard veranda, rather than interior corridors or direct connections to other rooms. ===India=== Being a warm, tropical country porches for houses was natural in India. In Northern India where Central Asian influence was strong such porches were rather walled courtyard. However, in South India, especially in hot humid western coastal region porches in the manner of veranda are very common especially in states like Kerala and Konkan region in broad. There were strong Portuguese and Dutch influence in this region. The origin of word veranda in English language owes a lot to this region. The Portuguese word varanda got into the local language as verandah especially in Malayalam and Marathi. This later migrated into other languages and English as loan word. ===Sri Lanka (Ceylon)=== Given its Portuguese, Dutch and British rule, many colonial Sri Lankan bungalows feature verandas. In the Sri Lankan Walauwa (a house once used by headmen under colonial rule) it is used as a space for leisure where families will spend time or read newspapers. Given the rarity of the architectural style in contemporary Sri Lanka houses with verandas are often featured in local films and dramas and symbolise a wealthy household. ==See also== *Awning *Baldresca *Canopy *Deck *Engawa *Gallery *Lanai (architecture) *Loggia *Overhang (architecture) *Patio *Porch sitting *Shophouse *Terrace ==References== ==External links== *Archnet discussion forum on Verandah *British Empire Architecture *Glazed Victorian Verandah with 13 cast-iron fluted Gothic columns *Ajay Sinha Discovers Experimentation in Ancient Indian Temple Design *See more verandahs in the State Library of Queensland's collection Category:Architectural elements Category:Architecture of Barbados Category:Garden features Category:Hindi words and phrases ","title":"Veranda"},{"id":"1433062","text":"NSCC may refer to: * National Securities Clearing Corporation * Non-small-cell lung carcinoma * North Seattle Community College * North Shore Community College * Northwest State Community College * Nova Scotia Community College * North Star College Cup * United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps ","title":"NSCC"},{"id":"1433063","text":"Normanton is a small outback cattle town and coastal locality in the Shire of Carpentaria in Queensland, Australia. It is the administrative centre of the Shire. In the 2016 census, Normanton had a population of 1,210 people, of whom 743 were Indigenous Australians. It has a tropical savanna climate. The town is one terminus of the isolated Normanton to Croydon railway line, which was built during gold rush days in the 1890s. The Gulflander passenger train operates once a week. The \\"Big Barramundi\\" and a statue of a large saltwater crocodile are notable features of the town, along with many heritage-listed sites. ==History== The Big Barramundi The town sits in the traditional lands of the Gkuthaarn (Kareldi) and Kukatj people. The town takes its current name from the Norman River, which was named in honour of William Henry Norman of the Victorian Naval Forces, who commanded a ship in the search for the explorers Burke and Wills and also conducted hydrographic surveys of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Torres Strait to identify reefs and other marine hazards. The site for the town was selected after Burketown was abandoned owing to fever and flooding. Settlers moved into the town in 1867. Normanton attracted people from a variety of cultures, including Chinese people drawn to the gold fields. Norman River Post Office opened on 13 June 1868 and was renamed Normanton by 1872. The town contains the longest intact and operating Burns Philp store in Queensland. The general mercantile store and agency office was opened in 1884. The population reached 1,251 by 1891. The gold boom was short-lived. By 1947 the town's population had declined to 234. Some Aboriginal people were moved to missions on Mornington Island and Doomadgee in the early 20th century. The Normanton library was opened in 2004. == Heritage listings == Normanton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Burke and Wills Access Road (Private Road): Burke and Wills Camp B/CXIX * Burke Developmental Road: Normanton Cemetery * 27 Haigh Street: Normanton Gaol * cnr Landsborough Street and Caroline Street: Burns Philp Building * Landsborough Street: Westpac Bank Building * Matilda Street: Normanton railway station * Normanton to Croydon: Normanton to Croydon railway line ==Geography== Normanton is in the Gulf Country region of northwest Queensland, just south of the Gulf of Carpentaria, on the Norman River in Queensland. It is a small cattle town and coastal locality, and administrative centre of the Shire of Carpentaria. An unusual feature southwest of Normanton is Bang Bang Jump Up, one of the few hills located in the middle of an expansive, flat grassland. ==Demographics== In 2006 census, the town's population was 1,100, 60 per cent of identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. In the 2016 census, Normanton had a population of 1,210 people, of whom 743 identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. ==Industry== Like other Gulf communities, the prawning industry makes an important economic contribution to the town. Tourism has recently become an important part of the economy of Normanton, with Gulflander a significant draw-card. ==Attractions and facilities== Among Normanton's most notable features is a statue of an long saltwater crocodile named Krys, the largest ever taken, which was shot by Krystina Pawlowska in July 1957 in the Norman River. \\"The Big Barramundi\\", which is long, is also located in the town. Normanton has a sports centre, golf course, bowling green, gun club, racecourse, rodeo ground, and an aerodrome. Normanton public library and visitor information services are located in the historic Burns Philp Building at the corner of Caroline and Landsborough Streets. Barramundi and Threadfin Salmon may be caught in the river. The Normanton branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association has its rooms in Landsborough Street. Normanton State School opened on 8 September 1882. The school celebrated its centenary in 1982. ==Native title== After seeking rights since 1996, in November 2012 the traditional owners, the Gkuthaarn and Kukatj people, lodged a claim for native title over an area around Normanton stretching . On 2 July 2020 an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) was signed, and they were granted rights to fish, hunt and perform their ceremonies on the land. Pastoralists are still able to run cattle on the cattle stations in the area, and the Aboriginal people assist with management of the land (such as pest and weed control) and cultural heritage sites. They are already monitoring and counting of migratory seabirds, with many participating as Indigenous rangers in the Normanton Land and Sea Ranger Group. Some land in the southern part of the claimed area has been determined as \\"native title extinguished\\". == Transport == The Gulflander, 2011 south of the town is the start of the Gulf Developmental Road, part of the Savannah Way tourist drive. The Gulflander passenger train operates weekly on a remnant of the Normanton to Croydon historical railway. The Normanton railway station features a large steel frame with an open canopy to provide shade. ==Climate== Normanton has a tropical savanna climate with two distinct seasons. There is a hot, humid and extremely uncomfortable wet season from December to March and a hot and generally rainless dry season usually extending from April to November. During the wet season most roads in the area are usually closed by heavy rainfall, which on several occasions has exceeded in a month or in a day from tropical cyclones. On occasions, as with all of Queensland, the wet season may fail and deliver as little as between December 1934 and March 1935 Temperatures are uniformly hot, ranging from in November just before the wet season begins to at the height of the dry season in July. In the wet season, temperatures are marginally lower, but extremely high humidity means conditions are very uncomfortable and wet bulb temperatures averages and can reach . In the dry season, lower humidity, cloudless days and cool nights provides for more pleasant conditions.

It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 77th Academy Awards. It also won Best Sound and Best Editing at the inaugural edition of the Africa Movie Academy Awards. The film tells a story of a young mother, Yesterday (Leleti Khumalo), who discovers she has AIDS. Her husband, a migrant mine laborer, rejected her despite being the one that infected her. Her ambition becomes to live long enough to see her daughter, Beauty, go to school. This film is the first commercial feature-length production in Zulu. == Credited cast == *Kenneth Khambula as John Khumalo, Yesterday's husband *Leleti Khumalo as Yesterday *Harriet Lenabe as Teacher *Lihle Mvelase as Beauty *Camilla Walker as The female doctor == Plot == Yesterday is a Zulu mother living with her seven-year-old daughter, Beauty, in their rural village of Rooihoek (English translation means literally \\"red corner\\"), in Zululand, South Africa. Every day of her life is spent in the hard work of tilling the field to plant enough food for them, fetching water, cutting firewood and hauling it home, all while also trying to keep her daughter stimulated and occupied. She strikes up a friendship with the new teacher who arrives in the village. Yesterday is plagued by a persistent cough and feelings of weakness. She goes to the local clinic, which is an extremely long walk for her and Beauty. She waits all day in the long queue to see the doctor, only to be turned away at the end of the day without having seen the doctor. She brushes it off, saying that she is not that ill. When Beauty finds her mother collapsed on the doorstep of their home, she runs to call her mother's friend, the teacher. Yesterday consults a traditional healer, but her teacher friend insists she return to the clinic. The teacher pays for a taxi to the clinic so that she can get there early enough to see the doctor; the teacher also takes care of Beauty for the day. The doctor who sees Yesterday asks her where she got her name from, and Yesterday explains that her father named her Yesterday because, \\"He said things were better yesterday than today.\\" The doctor tells Yesterday that her illness is AIDS-related and that she probably got it from her husband, who is away working in a mine. After hearing the news, Yesterday is very upset. Yesterday understands that she will die from this disease, leaving her daughter alone. She makes a plan to travel to the mine where her husband, John, works to tell him the news and to tell him that he also is sick. He reacts to this news very badly and beats her, while his supervisor looks in and then looks away. Yesterday goes home and tries to continue living her life as best she can. She asks her teacher friend to take care of Beauty when she dies. A few months later John comes home to her. He is very ill from AIDS-related illnesses and begs Yesterday's forgiveness for blaming her and for beating her for telling him the truth. He explains that he has been fired from the mine, as he is now incontinent and there are no toilets down in the mine, so all day he would stink \\"like an animal\\". The other villagers, who do not understand HIV/AIDS, protest at having John living amongst them and say that he must leave or go to hospital. Yesterday tried to get her husband into a nearby clinic but was unsuccessful, as there were no available beds for him and he would need to be put on a waiting list. Due to this, she sets out to make her own hospital on a nearby hill. Using sheet metal and pieces of old cars and taxis, she puts together a building, which she then helps her husband to with her daughter's assistance. As they are making the laborious journey to the \\"hospital\\", John comments that when he was young he could run from one end of this field to the other and not think of it, now it seems like the longest journey of his life. Yesterday and Beauty take care of him as well as they can until he dies. Yesterday's focus then falls on preparing Beauty for school. Yesterday never went to school, so her single goal becomes living long enough to be able to see Beauty attend. When the doctor tells her she has a strong body that keeps the illness somewhat under control she replies it's not the body but her mind. Yesterday watches as her daughter starts her first day at school and then walks off as the camera pans back from her. == Awards == * \\"Best Film\\" at the 3rd Pune International Film Festival in India. * \\"Inaugural Human Rights Film Award\\" at the 2004 Venice Film Festival. * Awards for \\"Best Sound\\", \\"Best Make Up\\" and \\"Best Editing\\" at the 2005 African Movie Academy Awards * Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards. * Nominated for Outstanding Made for Television movie at the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards *Won a Peabody Award in 200565th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2006. ==References== == External links == *Official site * * Movies Yesterday Category:2004 television films Category:2004 films Category:2004 drama films Category:South African films Category:Films set in South Africa Category:Zulu- language films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Darrell Roodt Category:HIV/AIDS in film Category:HBO Films films Category:Best Sound Africa Movie Academy Award winners Category:Best Editing Africa Movie Academy Award winners Category:Peabody Award-winning broadcasts ","title":"Yesterday (2004 film)"},{"id":"1433081","text":"The Faculty of Agriculture at Dalhousie University is a Canadian agricultural college and faculty of Dalhousie University located in Bible Hill, Nova Scotia. The Faculty of Agriculture offers the only university level programs in agriculture in Atlantic Canada. Founded 14 February 1905 as the Nova Scotia Agricultural College within the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, it merged with Dalhousie University on 1 September 2012. The campus is referred to as Dalhousie University's \\"Agricultural Campus\\" or by its popular nickname of \\"Dal AC\\" or simply the \\"AC.\\" ==History== The Faculty of Agriculture was officially founded on 1 September 2012 with the merger of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC) into Dalhousie University.N.S. Agricultural College to merge with DalhousieDal name hailed in Bible Hill The Faculty of Agriculture traces its history to The School of Agriculture, founded in 1885 and located in Truro, as well as The School of Horticulture, founded in 1893 and located in Wolfville. These two institutions merged on 14 February 1905 to form the Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC) and the new institution, managed by the Government of Nova Scotia's Department of Agriculture, relocated to the provincial demonstration farm in Bible Hill. The Bible Hill campus, located on a bluff along the north bank of the Salmon River, expanded throughout the 20th century to a total area of . In the early years, the NSAC and its predecessor institutions focused on educating farmers in aspects of field and animal husbandry. These early graduates often went on to pursue a university degree, usually from Macdonald College at McGill University or the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ontario. A disastrous fire in 1946 destroyed the science building and a temporary campus was set up at a former Canadian Army hospital at nearby Camp Debert. This temporary campus served students until the fall of 1953 when the new science building, now known as the Harlow Institute, was opened on the Bible Hill campus. In 1980 the Government of Nova Scotia passed legislation authorizing the institution to grant undergraduate B.Sc. (Agr.) degrees.Chapter 6 of the Revised Statutes, 1989, \\"Agriculture and Marketing Act\\", Part XVI Agricultural Education. The decision was made by the institution to do this in association with Dalhousie University and the first students graduated with the new degree in 1985. An agreement was subsequently made with Dalhousie to provide M.Sc. degrees beginning in 1996. NSAC granted its own diplomas for 2-year technology programs and the institution remained an independent post-secondary research and education institution administered by the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the NSAC, Canada Post issued 'Nova Scotia Agricultural College, 1905-2005' on 14 February 2005 as part of the Canadian Universities series. The stamp was based on a design by Denis L'Allier and a photograph by Guy Lavigueur. The 50¬¢ stamps are kiss cut and were printed by Lowe-Martin Company Inc.

Shortly after this move, Bach removed the ‚ÄúFaciebat Anno‚Äù marking from his bell engraving that had been in use since before the 100th horn, and began stamping the bells with ‚ÄúModel‚Äù followed by numbers for the bell mandrel and bore size. Some horns have \\"New York 67\\" as the location on the bell and are sometimes mistaken for a \\"67\\" bell model, however 67 was the pre-zipcode postal code for the Bronx. This practice continued through most of this period. The bell mandrel number had previously appeared in Bach‚Äôs script ‚ÄúVincent Bach Corporation‚Äù that has been an enduring marking on Bach horns. In 1933, Bach settled on the \\"type-E\\" valve, actually according to Roy Hempley the \\"New type-E\\" appears on the first such shop cards, occasionally combining type-E with type-C or others for reasons Bach may only have known. To accommodate this, the tight \\"2-over, 2-under\\" wrap gained in height, departing further from Besson designs than the previous horns had. The company experienced stresses, but survived the depression and expanded again afterward.

Throughout the early years, Bach resorted to mixing parts and modifying earlier horns returned to their ownership during this period to provide requested instruments to customers. Some horns built from extra parts or reconfigured bear an X on the serial number on the second valve casing, others had a digit added to the original serial number. In some cases, the same serial number exists on another horn.Hempley, Roy and Lehrer, Doug, Bach‚Äôs X Horns, 2001, Bachology essay at http://www.bachbrass.com/bachology/article.php?uid=2 retrieved 5/31/2011 After WWII, Bach was similarly creative in the first years with manpower and material shortages. The wrap height increased slightly during these years, and the tuning slide while still a \\"D\\" shape, became correspondingly flatter. ===Mount Vernon Period=== Vincent Bach Mount Vernon manufactured trumpet (#26XXX) in an Elkhart case circa late 60s Early Mt.

The Vincent Bach Corporation moved in 1953 from New York City to Mount Vernon, New York. Mt. Vernon Bach horns are prized for being hand-assembled instruments. Mt. Vernon horns can be identified by the Bach manufacturing stamp listing Mount Vernon NY on the second valve casing along with the bore letter code and serial number. At first, the instruments built at the new factory were identical to the bulk of what had been produced the few years before These were typified by the same wrap height and .020\\" bell stock Bach had been using primarily after the war.

However, several Bach periods each have their fans and the Mt. Vernon mystique is in part due to the early advocacy of these in particular. The design of the trumpet changed at this point in time to include the full wrap height still built today, to feature a flat-faced tuning slide, and to one which required the tuning slide be pulled an inch rather than the customary 1/2 inch to be in tune. This last, by some workings of the physics, is said to \\"loosen the centering\\" and \\"open the blow\\" (make it take less energy to match pitch with others and make the horn respond).

Selmer asked Bach, as the first task in his new (lifetime) position as technical consultant, to redesign his trumpet so as to eliminate the unique one inch pull required to be in tune, in favor of a standard 1/2 inch pull. This design was dubbed the model 180. ===Elkhart Period=== Bach logo on a 30,000-series Mellophonium.

At some point the rim wire was also changed back to brass. Sales of Bach instruments remained strong, as did market reputation through the 1970s and 1980s, but in the 1990s both the size of the workforce and the warranty costs began to increase dramatically. Sales decreased at the same time.

Long time employee Tedd Waggoner took the lead role in the company until his retirement in 2018. Minor changes to design such as a longer receiver and reintroducing the oldest Bach bell taper happened during this period, as did the ramping-up of a new 190 series of \\"Artisan\\" trumpets that replicated the 2-piece casings and steel rim wire of Early Elkhart production. New private owners began an aggressive program of upgrading to automated CNC lathes and milling equipment as well as robotic buffers in 2017.

The main issues were the union's desire to preserve employee compensation and company's goals to increase product quality. Production was interrupted until the company hired replacement workers, and roughly a third of the strikers returned to work.Marilyn, Odendahl (05 August 2009). \\"Three years later, the Vincent Bach strike -- and the union -- ends quietly \\".

Ethekwini Online describes it as \\"The music played by the man on the move, the modern minstrel, today‚Äôs troubadour. It is the music of the man walking the long miles to court a bride, or to meet with his Chief; a means of transport. It is the music of the man who sings of his real life experiences, his daily joys and sorrows, his observations of the world. It‚Äôs the music of the man who‚Äôs got the Zulu blues.\\" Nowadays this is untrue in as much as it is no longer just the domain of men. African women - notably the Busi Mhlongo, and in more recent times Dr. Buselaphi Gxowa, Osukasambe, Imithente, Izingane Zoma and Lungi Ngcobo, daughter of the late Shiyani Ngcobo - are also making Maskandi music. The style music is largely popular and mostly consumed in the Kwa-Zulu Natal province, given its rich Zulu heritage and significance to the Zulu tribe. Maskandi happens to be the second top selling genre in South Africa, after Gospel music. Although Maskandi music can be heard in more urban cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town, it is important to note that it is largely played by migrants who come to the big cities to seek a better quality of life and better employment opportunities. Maskandi typically fails to connect with a wider audience and this is largely due to a lack of overall understanding of the genre, which subsequently leads to a lack of interest from listeners. These perceptions are beginning to change quite rapidly, as the world observes more people following African oriented trends. Although the genre has been in existence for many years, after the 90's there seemed to be no real interest shown in the music by youths and young musicians. This was due to the large influences of western and pop culture, which led to most young musicians to choose to pursue western genres of music such as Hip-Hop, Pop and RnB. This led to the problem of having very few young Maskandi musicians to carry the genre forward, putting the future of the genre at risk. In recent years more evolved Maskandi acts have emerged including quite notably the likes of Mbuzeni Mkhize, Imfezi Emnyama, Igcokama Elisha King Duyaza, Mjikjelwa Ngubane (Late) Amageza Amahle, The Bunny Chows Carrots the late Khulekanikwakhe (Umgqumeni) Mseleku ka Khumalo (who can be said to be the father of the Maskandi as most of the artists who sing the music today follow his style of singing, with long recitations of his achievements and trials in life-known as izibongo), Khuzani Mpungose, Mdumazi Mhlongo, Dlubheke and others, who have taken up the role of youth activists for the genre. Such \\"newer\\" acts have dedicated themselves to the preservation and appreciation of Maskandi music, as well as traditional forms of music as a whole. Many of these newer Maskandi musicians advocate for youth and future generations to learn from and co-innovate with their more experienced counterparts, in order to ensure the secrets and intricate nuances of Maskandi are properly and correctly preserved for future generations. Between the '60s and early '90s Maskandi acts Izingane Zoma, Bhekumuzi Luthuli and Mfaz'Omnyama contributed to exposing Maskandi to the international market. ==Instrumentation and traditions== Maskandi is typically played on cheap, portable instruments, or modern instruments tuned or produced to imitate the polyphonic sounds of the old instruments. Traditionally, a Maskandi musician had one song, a long one that evolved as the story of the musician's life grew. Nowadays albums may contain the usual 10-14 tracks, some of which though may still be over the three-minute mark. Although there are several variations of Maskandi, the instrumental ensemble typically remains the same in all variations. This is deliberately done to keep the unique sound. When listening to Maskandi, these are the typical instruments to be heard: * Concertina, \\"Inkostin'\\" or \\"Inkostina\\" (Typically a 20 button Anglo concertina, tuned to G/C and played Maskandi style). A common misconception some people make is to identify a concertina as an accordion. An accordion is mostly found in Sotho music, and is much larger in size that a Concertina. The tone produced by the Concertina is also much brighter and higher pitched. * Acoustic Guitar, \\"Isginci\\". In \\"every\\" Maskandi band is an acoustic guitar played in a unique rhythmic picking pattern. The guitar is also the instrument that leads the entire band, and all elements need to blend in with the guitar's setup, this can include adjusting tuning, key and other aspects of the accompanying instruments. Typically the thumb and index fingers are used when playing Maskandi technique, and it is widely known that Maskandi guitar is one of the most difficult techniques to learn and master as a guitarist. In most cases, Maskandi guitarist are also the lead singer or front man of the band. The most notable difference with the Maskandi guitar technique, is the way in which the guitar is tuned. A true Maskandi guitarist is typically fiercely protective of their tuning, as this forms a significant part of identifying the band/guitarist. To be able to play the Maskandi guitar or the song of another Maskandi guitarist, you would need to first figure out the tuning of that guitar and then figure out all of the licks and possible riff phrasing combinations that make a musical melody or rhythm. Because of this, Maskandi guitarists are typically very technically advanced as well as extremely competitive, albeit rarely formally trained in music and guitar. As the complexity of the tuning and licks increases, so does the reputation and respect of the guitarist. * Bass Guitar, \\"uBhesi\\" or \\"amaBhesi\\" or \\"emaBhesini\\". Also, the heartbeat of the Maskandi song, the unique sound of Maskandi also relies heavily on the correctness and technical application of the bass work. Maskandi bass serves as the source of the groove of the song. It is typically played in a very aggressive manner and sounds best when played with emotion and soul. * Keyboards/Synth * Drums * Backing Vocalists, \\"Abavumayo\\". Backing vocalists are an extremely important element in Maskandi music, basically no Maskandi song is complete without there being backing vocalists. Given that Maskandi is a very soulful and deeply personal genre, the backing vocalists responsibility is to create and set the tone and overall mood of a Maskandi song. \\"Ukuvuma ingoma\\", literally means to sing along in agreement with what the lead vocalist is singing. The backing vocalists also carry deep secrets in how a Maskandi song is arranged and sequenced and are therefore as equally important as the other accompanying elements. The vocal riffs are usually intentionally complicated and include a lot of unconventional phrasing. The extensive use of legato and sharp notes makes the riffs unique to the Maskandi genre. Typically a Maskandi lead or backing singer should have a solid understanding of the concepts of musical key, harmony as well as good rhythm/timing. Given the emphatic singing style, it is also important for a Maskandi singer to have developed lung capacity and demonstrate a good breathing technique. ==Variations of Maskandi== As there is very little documented literature and information readily available on Maskandi, it is therefore not common knowledge that there are actually subgenres or variations of Maskandi. It is important to consider Maskandi as more of a lifestyle or way of life, as opposed to explicitly a musical genre. Other variations of Maskandi include: * Umzansi also called Isikhomazi * Ushameni * Isigekle * Isitorotoro * Isibhaca All of which have their own unique identifying traits which are easily picked up and identified by Maskandi enthusiasts. More recently there have been artists and other musicians who have labelled their music \\"Maskandi\\", however the music does not meet a lot of the minimum requirements or criteria for a musical piece to be accepted as real Maskandi. This is largely due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of traditional Maskandi music. Applied or performed incorrectly, an ignorant Maskandi musician may even upset or insult the fraternity, which is why many modern artists would rather include Maskandi elements in their music, in genres such as \\"digital Maskandi\\" which includes American Hip- Hop/Rap elements. Other South African artists such as Zola, Zuluboy, Thandiswa Mazwai, and Ntando have apparent Maskandi influences and elements in their music, however are not necessarily traditional Maskandi acts. ==Musical Style== A traditional Maskandi song is distinguished by an instrumental flourish (\\"izihlabo\\"), typically that of the acoustic guitar or the concertina that sets the tone at the beginning of each song. Izihlabo are also an introduction of sorts, and serve the purpose of allowing the guitarist to showcase/show off his level of skill by capturing the listeners' attention. Given that traditional Maskandi guitarists tune their guitars differently, listening to izihlabo also provides a way for the listener to tell with certainty the identity of the guitarist/band. Izihlabo are typically rapidly played notes, that do not necessarily make up a melody or explicit rhythm. Playing izihlabo can also be likened to an actor getting into character. In a Maskandi song, there will typically be rapidly spoken sections of Zulu praise poetry, called \\"izibongo\\". The content is not always praise, though, and with pop, house and other influences colouring Maskandi, it has become more about the storytelling ethic and the modern migrant culture, than simply about the musical style. Another key element of Maskandi music is the lead singer or frontman's natural personality. In Maskandi music, it is not uncommon for songs to \\"sound the same\\", yet the music consumption does not necessarily decrease. Fundamentally Maskandi is about telling stories and providing a window to the lead singer‚Äôs soul. It is largely about the message carried in the songs and music, and this is why it is considered the same as listening to soul or blues music.. Early 2000s there was a new artist introduced called Mtshengiseni Gcwensa (late) who started music with his friend Mgqumeni Khumalo (late). They both introduced many styles in this industry which made upcoming artists look up to them. Composer Darius Brubeck explained: \\"The Maskanda referred to in the title of my work is a performer of neo-traditional Zulu instrumental music. Etymologically the word derives from the Afrikaans musikante (musicians). Kwa-Zulu Natal, a province of South Africa where I have lived and worked for the past decade, is home to literally thousands of 'Maskandis', who have developed a rich musical repertoire employing a special style of guitar playing.\\"SAMRO(South African Music Rights Organization) SCORES: Darius Brubeck-The Maskanda: 1992: ==Prominent Maskandi Musicians== ==References== Amageza Amahle Ithwasa langempela Ofakazi Category:Maskanda musicians Category:South African styles of music Category:Zulu music ","title":"Maskandi"},{"id":"1433097","text":"Erzya or Erzia may refer to: *Erzya language, a Uralic language spoken in Russia *Erzya literature, literature written in the Erzya language *Erzyan Mastor, a splinter group from the Mastorava religion *Erzyan Mastor (journal), an Erzyan- and Russian-language bilingual newspaper *Erzya people *Stepan Erzia (1876‚Äì1959), Mordvin sculptor who lived in Russia ==See also== *Erza (disambiguation) ","title":"Erzya"},{"id":"1433099","text":"A varicocele is an abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum. This plexus of veins drains blood from the testicles back to the heart. The vessels originate in the abdomen and course down through the inguinal canal as part of the spermatic cord on their way to the testis. Varicoceles occur in around 15% to 20% of all men. The incidence of varicocele increase with age. ==Signs and symptoms== Varicocele might be noticed as soft lumps, usually above the testicle and mostly on the left side of the scrotum. Right-sided and bilateral varicocele does also occur. Men with varicocele can feel symptoms of pain or heaviness in their scrotum. Large varicoceles present as plexus of veins and may be described as \\"bag of worms\\". Varicocele is sometimes discovered when investigating the cause of male infertility. ==Cause== Cross section showing the pampiniform venus plexus There are three main theories as to the anatomical cause; the first has to do with the geometry of the veins, wherein the vein on the left side connects to the larger outflowing vein at a right angle, which tends to fail; the second is that valves that are supposed to prevent backflow fail (venous insufficiency); the third is due to excessive pressure in upstream arteries, created by nutcracker syndrome. ==Pathophysiology== Often the greatest concern with respect to varicocele is its effect on male fertility. The relationship between varicocele and infertility is unclear. Some men with the condition are fertile, some have sperm that are normal in shape and move normally but are compromised in function, and some have sperm with abnormal shapes or that do not move well. Theories as to how varicocele affects sperm function include damage via excess heat caused by the blood pooling and oxidative stress on sperm. Tobacco smoking and mutations in the gene expressing glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 both put men at risk for infertility; these factors may also exacerbate the risk that varicocele will affect fertility. ==Diagnosis== Following discovery of the sign of swelling comprising a mass, varicocele can be confirmed with scrotal ultrasound, which will show dilation of the vessels of the pampiniform plexus to be greater than 2 mm. File:trans varicocele.tifVaricocele in ultrasound (left: testicle) File:Varicocele.pngVaricocele ==Treatment== Sewn up wound after varicocele surgery The two most common surgical approaches are retroperitoneal (abdominal using laparoscopic surgery), infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin) and inguinal (groin using percutaneous embolization). Possible complications of this procedure include hematoma (bleeding into tissues), hydrocele (accumulation of fluid around the affected testicle), infection, or injury to the scrotal tissue or structures. In addition, injury to the artery that supplies the testicle may occur, resulting in a loss of a testicle. Whether having varicocele surgery or embolization improves male fertility is controversial, as good clinical data is lacking. There is tentative evidence that varicocelectomy may improve fertility in those with obvious findings and abnormal sperm; however, this has a number needed to treat of 7 for varicocelectomy and 17 for embolization. There are also studies showing that the regular surgery has no significant effect on infertility. A 2012 Cochrane review found tentative but unclear evidence of improved fertility among males treated for varicocele. Evidence for sclerotherapy is unclear as of 2015. ==Epidemiology== Around 15% to 20% of all adult males, up to 35% to 40% of men who are evaluated for male infertility, and around 80% of men who are infertile due to some other cause, have varicocele. ==References== == External links == Category:Andrology Category:Male genital disorders Category:Scrotum Category:Vascular diseases ","title":"Varicocele"},{"id":"1433116","text":"Bertil H.W.

He is a saint of the Orthodox Church, known as Saint Innocent for the monastic name he used in later life. The volcano was the site of a colossal (VEI 6) eruption around 1750 BCE. This eruption left a large caldera. In modern times the volcano has had numerous small eruptions (over ten of them since 1930), all at a cinder cone in the middle of the caldera. Veniaminof is one of the highest of Alaskan volcanoes. Partly for this reason, it is covered by a glacier that fills most of the caldera. Because of the glacier and the caldera walls, there is the possibility of a major flood from a future glacier run. The volcano recently began erupting on September 3, 2018 as magma broke through the summit and flowed down its slopes as a lava flow. Despite starting off as an effusive eruption, by November 20, the eruption became more intense and ash was reaching 20,000 feet, prompting the AVO to give a warning for aviation because of the ash posing a threat to aviation.

He was a Senator for Queensland from 1901 to 1906, and then represented the Division of Capricornia in the House of Representatives from 1910 to 1922. He served as Treasurer of Australia from 1915 to 1916, under Billy Hughes. ==Early life== Higgs was born on 18 January 1862 in Wingham, New South Wales. He was the oldest of at least ten children, including nine boys, born to William Guy Higgs Sr. and Elizabeth Gregg. His parents ran a general store; his father was born in St Columb Major, Cornwall, England, while his mother was born in Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland. Higgs and his family moved to Parramatta in 1869 and then to Orange in 1872. He attended state schools except for a brief period at a Catholic convent school when it was the closest available; his parents were Anglican and he had to wait outside during religious instruction. He left school at the age of 13 and was apprenticed to the Western Advocate as a printer's assistant. Higgs moved to Sydney in 1882, working briefly for the commercial printer John Sands and the Daily Telegraph. He eventually found a steady job as a compositor for The Sydney Morning Herald. In 1886, Higgs was elected to the board of the New South Wales Typographical Association, the foremost trade union for workers in the printing industry. Later that year, he left the Herald to become the association's paid secretary. He resigned that position in 1889 and opened a printing firm, Higgs & Townsend, on Oxford Street, in partnership with Samuel D. Townsend. It specialised in socialist publications, and for a brief period printed the Trades and Labor Advocate and Tribune of the People, a newspaper that Higgs owned and edited. From 1890 to 1891, he was the editor of The Australian Workman, the magazine of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council. He returned to compositing for a period at the Evening News, but then in 1893 moved to Brisbane to become editor of The Worker. He remained in the position until his election to parliament in April 1899, and was credited with increasing both the publication's circulation and influence. ==Early political involvement== Despite his limited education, Higgs read widely in politics and became an avowed socialist. He was prominent in the Australian Socialist League, and in 1891 appeared as a witness before the Royal Commission on Strikes. He provided the inquiry with an analysis of the history and theory of socialism, and told it that \\"the State should be the sole employer of labour [...] it should provide everything, all the necessaries of life and all the comforts\\". Higgs was secretary of the South Sydney Labor Electoral League, and at the 1891 election stood unsuccessfully as a candidate in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of South Sydney. The following year, he was a delegate to the first general conference of the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales and was elected as the organisation's inaugural chairman. After moving to Brisbane, Higgs unsuccessfully stood for the Queensland Legislative Assembly seat of Fortitude Valley at the 1896 general election. He had been elected to the executive of the Queensland Labor Party earlier in the same year. Higgs was elected to the Brisbane City Council in February 1899, representing North Ward, and the following month successfully reprised his candidacy in Fortitude Valley at the 1899 general election. Although his time in the Legislative Assembly was relatively short, he did gain favourable publicity by revealing an attempt to bribe him to support a government bill. He crossed the floor to vote against the Labor Party just a few months after being elected, opposing a motion that would have allowed recipients of government scholarships to use them at non-government schools. ==Federal politics== Portrait of Higgs by Swiss Studios After Federation of the Australian states, Higgs became a Senator for Queensland from 30 March 1901 until 31 December 1906. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1903 to 1906, the first member of the Labor Party to hold the position.

He was the first former Senator to be elected to the House of Representatives, and the first Queenslander to have served in both houses of federal parliament. He served as Treasurer in the ministry of Billy Hughes from 1915 to 1916, until he resigned due to his opposition to Hughes' support for conscription during World War I. Hughes and the other pro-conscriptionists were expelled from the party soon afterward. However, Higgs was somewhat troubled by the expulsion of many of his old friends. He was also concerned that Labor was taking an increasingly radical turn. Despite this, he remained with Labor, even becoming deputy leader in 1918. However, in 1919, when Labor opposed Hughes' plans to increase the federal government's powers over industry and commerce, Higgs supported them and was expelled from the party in January 1920. After eight months as an independent, he joined Hughes' Nationalist Party. However, Capricornia was naturally a Labor seat, and at the 1922 election, he was soundly defeated by Labor's Frank Forde.Federal Legislative Election of 16 December 1922 (Qld results), ‚Äî Psephos: Adam Carr's Electoral Archive ==Life after politics== Higgs later became a campaigner for the plight of the mentally ill and was the Honorary president of the Society for the Welfare of Mental Patients.

The main road passing through the town is the R716 road, called Malan Street in Oranjeville. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Metsimaholo Local Municipality ","title":"Oranjeville"},{"id":"1433146","text":"Parys (pronounced ) is a town situated on the banks of the Vaal River in the Free State province of South Africa. The name of the town is the Afrikaans translation of Paris. The name was given by a German surveyor named Schilbach who had participated in the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War and the location next to the Vaal reminded him of Paris on the River Seine. The area of Parys also includes the two townships Tumahole and Schonkenville. ==History== In the early 1870s, towns in the northern Free State were situated very far apart and members of different churches had to travel great distances to participate in religious services. It was then decided by the Ring of the Dutch Reformed Church to implant the idea of a congregation north of the Rhenoster River into the minds of the residents of the farm Klipspruit, on the Vaal River, which was owned by four van Coller brothers. After long deliberation by the brothers, the first erven were laid out in 1876, and the little town of Parys was born. The first few years of existence did not bring much development to the town, but the fact that it was situated en route to Johannesburg from the south, meant that the gold rush of 1886 on the Witwatersrand brought prosperity and wealth to Parys as it was used as a stopover and later as a trading post. The outbreak of the Anglo-Boer war in 1899 brought the bustling town to a standstill as many 'burgers' had to leave the town to fight in the war. The town and surrounding area was the scene of much guerrilla warfare because, surrounded as it is by hills and the river being full of woody islands, it was an ideal place for snipers. General de Wet ensured that good use was made of the natural advantages provided. Some remains of forts are still visible today in the hills around the town. The completion of the railway sideline to Parys in 1905 meant that Parys had suddenly become more accessible to the public and this in turn led to the growth of the town as a holiday resort and industrial centre. The town was now being marketed as The Pride of the Vaal and city dwellers flocked by train to the lush green river banks and special swimming facilities and accommodation provided by the Village Management Board of the time. Bungalows were built on Woody Island and were serviced by the Woody Island Ferry. Unfortunately, this venture did not last very long due to the inaccessibility of the island during flood periods. By now, residents of the town had felt for quite some time that a bridge across the Vaal River was no more than its just due. The Woody Island Ferry service crossed on to Woody Island and from there another ferry completed the crossing. The service was indifferent and accidents happened frequently. Farmers on the Transvaal side even preferred to go to Potchefstroom, away, rather than face the expense of the ferry crossings. Towards the end of 1913, Tenders were asked for a reinforced concrete bridge over the Vaal, and the contract was finally awarded to a Mr Warren. The work was started in May 1914. The outbreak of the First World War three months later caused long delays and the bridge was only finished and opened for traffic around Christmas 1915. As a consequence of the bridge over the Vaal, trade grew and Parys was seen as a new market for farmers from the then Transvaal side. Many new buildings were built as more and more traffic ran through the town. Not many of the original buildings and historic places remain today. The current Parys Palm Court Hotel is still one of the surviving turn of the century buildings (the Parys Hotel), as is the museum (once the magistrate's office) and \\"Moedergemeente\\" Church in the centre of town. There are, however, quite a few original and beautiful old houses remaining in and around town. Industries that have come and gone is the Orange River Canning Company, Parys Basket Works that used a special kind of willow planted on the river banks, a jam factory, boat building factory, cold drink factory and Parys Roller Milling Company. By the middle 1950s big industries like ARWA, BASA (nuts and bolts factory), Vaalrivierse Tabakkooperasie, Vetsak (agricultural co-op which was founded in Parys) and Metro Clothing Company had settled in the industrial area of Parys. Only a handful of industries remain today, and, like in the early days, the town is becoming increasingly popular as a weekend and holiday destination to people wanting to escape the pressures of city life. ==Tourist attractions== Many artists have settled in the town and many new interesting shops and attractions make it the ideal breakaway close to Gauteng and big centres. A unique attraction in Parys, the suspension bridge, was built in 1918 to connect Golf Island to the town. The current Town Hall was built in the 1930s in the typical Art Deco Style, after the original town Hall was destroyed by a fire. Parys is in the 5 km buffer zone of the Vredefort Dome World Heritage Site. Another key Tourism landmark is the Smilin Thru Resort, originally named after the B52 Bomber the first owner of the resort flew in World War 2. The Smilin Thru Resort is the best fishing spot on the Vaal River and is infamous for the Black Carp. Stonehenge in Africa is also situated on the banks of the Vaal River. Stonehenge in Africa is well known as a holiday destination, venue and also for the massive granite blocks used to build arches and entranceways. ==Notable citizens== Springboks great Frik du Preez, named South Africa's rugby player of the 20th century, was educated at Parys High School, although he was born in Rustenburg. Former NFL (American football) placekicker Gary Anderson was born in Parys, although raised in Durban. Parys was the original home of Johann van Schalkwyk, designer of the 2010 World Standards Day poster for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Furthermore, Parys and the township is home to former Premier of the Free State Province and current Secretary General of African Nation Congress Ace Magashule. Tumahole is also home to the current MEC of Education in the Free State, Mr Pule Herbert Isak \\"Tate\\" Makgoe. Bafana Bafana striker Tokelo Rantie also hails from the streets of Tumahole. One of the most outstanding citizens of Parys/Tumahole is Stompie Seipei who was a freedom fighter during the time of Apartheid. Stompie joined the fight at an age of only 10 years, got arrested a few times and was kidnapped on 29th of December 1988 by Mandela United Football Club, which were Winnie Mandela's bodyguards. He was accused of being a police informer. Stompie Seipei was killed on 1 January 1989, but the family only found out about it 2 weeks after the murder. Manankie Seipei, his mother who still lives in Tumahole, had to identify her son. The funeral was held in Tumahole. In 1991, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping, but her sentence (6 years in jail) was reduced to a fine and 2 years suspended. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found her guilty on initiating and participating in the assaults but regarding to the actual murder of Stompie, she was only found ‚Äúnegligent‚Äù. Winnie Mandela apologized in person to his mother and the two men accused of killing Stompie also apologized on National TV. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.parys.co.za/ * http://www.parys.mobi/ Category:Populated places in the Ngwathe Local Municipality Category:Populated places established in 1882 ","title":"Parys"},{"id":"1433155","text":"Petrusburg is a small mixed farming town in the Free State province of South Africa.

When it became a town, it was originally started on a farm close to \\"Emmaus\\", a railway station on the line between Bloemfontein and Kimberley. The original foundations are still there, but they ran out of water, and had to move to the present location where a strong fountain was available. So much so that the first houses had free running water from the fountain for irrigation. The town was named after Petrus Albertus Venter, whose farm, Diepfontein, provided the original land. It is situated on the N8 National Route between Bloemfontein (80 km east) and Kimberley (80 km west). Every year in March, a big music festival is held called the Aartappelfees (Potato Festival). The main street in town is Pretorius Street, but the busiest street is Ossewa street. A. J. C. Jooste High School is a coeducational boarding high school. Together with the associated primary school it is known as the AJC Jooste Combined School.

The channel has an international feed named \\"Ecuavisa Internacional\\". ==History== Ecuavisa was founded by Xavier Alvarado Roca and began to transmit programming on March 1, 1967. The network began broadcasting from Guayaquil and was originally known as Canal 2http://www.ecuavisa.com/articulo/entretenimiento/espectaculo/100820-48-anos- credibilidad-historia-alegria. The channel received support from Miami's WCKT, owned by Sydney Ansin. On June 1, 1970, Ecuavisa started broadcasting to Quito and became known as Cadena de Uni√≥n Nacional (National Unity Network). In the 1970s, Ecuavisa was able to increase its audience share by premiering new programming and starting broadcasting partnerships with regional providers. Ecuavisa also benefited from the advent of colour television, and was the first channel to broadcast in colour in Ecuador. Many Ecuadorian celebrities participated in Ecuavisa's shows throughout the 1980s and 1990s. During these two decades, the network aired some of Ecuador's top television shows. During the 2000s, Ecuavisa launched Ecuavisa Internacional, its international feed. The channel is broadcast in the United States on DirecTV and Verizon Fios. In Spain and Latin America, Ecuavisa Internacional is also broadcast as a free- to-air channel on Hispasat satellite. On May 9, 2013, Ecuavisa launched its own high-definition feed, Ecuavisa HD. ==Programming== Ecuavisa dedicates a great portion of its programming to international shows, mainly soap operas from Telemundo and Rede Globo, such as \\"El Clon\\" and \\"Bellisima\\". Ecuavisa's programming is oriented to family entertainment, educational programs, and soap operas (novelas). In 2007, Ecuavisa is boosting its own productions, with \\"El hombre de la casa\\" (a remake of Man about the House) a classic British comedy. Other remakes made are La ni√±era (The Nanny) and \\"Kliffor\\" (a remake of The Cosby Show), that achieved great success in Ecuador's ratings profile. Ecuavisa has a nightly news broadcast, Televistazo, which locals consider the most reliable news show in Ecuador. For years, it also aired programming for children, such as Dragon Ball and Doraemon from Japan. Non-anime series for children included Zooboomafoo, Little Robots, Sesame Street and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. In 2015, Ecuavisa came under fire for replacing reruns of Dragon Ball with the local version of Chilean competition show Yingo. This resulted in a mass protest from viewers and a change to the program's timeslot.http://www.elcomercio.com/tendencias/dragonballz-ecuavisa-television- yingo-redessociales.html ==References== ==External links== *Official site *Digital free reception of Ecuavisa Internacional in Europe Category:Television channels in Ecuador Category:Spanish-language television stations ","title":"Ecuavisa"},{"id":"1433210","text":"Philippolis is a small town in the Free State province of South Africa. The writer and intellectual Sir Laurens van der Post was born here. It is regarded as one of the first colonial period settlements in the Free State. ==History== The London Missionary Society (LMS) founded Philippolis in 1823 as a mission station for the local Griqua people. At first, the area was referred to as Southern Transorangia. The town takes its name from Dr John Philip, who was the superintendent of the LMS from 1819 to 1849. Adam Kok II, a Griqua leader, settled here with his people in 1826 and became the protector of the mission station. Kok II and some of his followers moved to Philippolis from Griquatown (about 200 km away) after there had been factional disputes in the area. When Adam Kok II was given possession of the mission station it was on condition that he promised to protect the San against the aggression of the Boers and the LMS hoped that the Griqua would promote peace in the region. However, Philippolis became a base from which a number of deadly commandos against the San people were organised within a year of the Griqua arrival. This violated the agreement made between the LMS and Adam Kok II and eventually the San were driven out of the area. Kok's son, Adam Kok III and his followers later migrated across the Drakensberg mountains to settle in Kokstad in Griqualand East. ==Monuments and tourist attractions== The town has a number of declared heritage sites including an historical jail that has been turned into a bed and breakfast guest house. ===Cannons=== Two naval cannons stand on top of a small hill which were presented by the Cape colonial government in 1840 to Adam Kok III who was the Griqua chief at that time. The cannons are fired during the town's Witblits festival held in April. These cannons may have been used during the various wars between the Griqua, Basotho and the Boers. ===Emily Hobhouse memorial=== Emily Hobhouse garden of remembrance Philippolis. This memorial commemorates human rights activist Emily Hobhouse who helped expose and publicize British war crimes and the use of concentration camps by Crown forces during the South African War. After the war, Hobhouse established a spinning and weaving school in Philippolis in 1905. ===Transgariep Museum=== This museum was opened on 2 March 1982. It focuses on the London Missionary Society (LMS), Adam Kok III and the Griqua as well as Emily Hobhouse and her weaving school. ===The Philippolis Jail=== The town jail was built in 1872 and served as a jail for 70 years. It was subsequently converted into a police station and several changes were made such as the repurposing of jail cells into charge offices. The SADF (South African Defence Force) used the jail as an army barracks from 1972 to 1982. The jail was abandoned from 1982 until 1998 when it was restored and turned into a bed and breakfast guest house. ===Old Dutch Reformed Church=== View of NG Kerk in Philippolis. The Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) in Philippolis was opened in 1871. The church is famous for its pulpit which is carved from wild olive and erected with no nails, screws or bolts. This site is a declared Provincial Heritage Site. ===Other declared heritage sites in the area=== Philippolis library Philippolis. *The property with the Old Victorian Library building thereon, Voortrekker Street *The property with the Dwelling-house thereon, 24 Tobie Muller Street *The property with the Dwelling-house thereon, being certain Portion ‚ÄúC‚Äù of Erf 97, Tobie Muller Street *The property with the Dwelling-house and adjoining building thereon, 26 Kok Street 26 Kok Street dwelling house Philippolis. *The property, together with the Karoo styled Dwelling-house thereon, 4 Justisie Street *The Old Pound, together with a portion of surrounding land, being 5 metres on the northern and western side of the structure, the land on the eastern site to and bordered by Justisie Street and the land on the southern side thereof to and bordered by Erf 129, Philippolis. *The property, together with the Victorian House thereon, 7 Colin Fraser Street (Amended declared in 1990. *The historic Old Power Magazine, together with 10 metres of surrounding land, situated on Subdivision 20 of the Town Lands of Philippolis 143,declared in 1991. *The wagon house adjacent the Victorian House together with the property on which they are situated, at 6 and 7 Colin Fraser Street.declared in 1990.

Green made his first-team debut for Norwich City in 1999 and totalled 241 appearances across all competitions for them, making the PFA Team of the Year when they won the First Division in 2003‚Äì04. In 2006, he transferred to West Ham United, making the same number of appearances in a six-year spell in which he was their Player of the Year in 2008 and won promotion via the Championship play-offs in 2012. He then moved on a free transfer to Queens Park Rangers, winning the play-offs again in 2014. In July 2016, Green joined Leeds United on a one-year contract. He later joined Huddersfield Town and Chelsea for one year each before retiring in 2019. Green represented England at under-16, under-18 and B level. He made his debut for the full England squad in 2005. Green was cut from England's 2006 FIFA World Cup squad due to injury but featured in the 2010 edition, in which he started the competition as England's first choice goalkeeper but was dropped after an error cost England a win against the United States. He was also in their squad for UEFA Euro 2012. ==Club career== ===Norwich City=== Born in Chertsey, Surrey, Green came through the youth system at Norwich City. He made his first-team debut in the First Division on 11 April 1999, keeping a clean sheet in the 0‚Äì0 East Anglia derby draw against rivals Ipswich Town at Carrow Road. The first-choice goalkeeper since 1997-1998 remained Andy Marshall -- on Marshall's departure in the summer of 2001 Green was able to establish himself as first choice goalkeeper for Norwich. He was a star of the 2001‚Äì02 season play-off campaign which culminated in a final loss to Birmingham City on penalties. By 2003, Green was a key figure in the Norwich team. He played a key role in helping Norwich into the First Division championship in 2003‚Äì04 and promotion into the Premier League. The Norwich number one was once again ever present, keeping another 18 clean sheets and conceding just 39 goals in 46 league appearances. Green put in many match winning performances during the season. These man of the match displays included home fixtures with Derby County and Stoke City; he pulled off a save from Gerry Taggart during the latter. Performances of this high standard led to his first England international call up for the friendly in March 2004 versus Sweden. He was also included in the PFA Team of the Year for the season. Norwich were relegated into the Championship the following season. Green kept just 6 clean sheets and conceded 77 goals during the Premier League season despite many excellent individual performances. England coach Sven- G√∂ran Eriksson continually picked Green for international squads on merit. After relegation Norwich struggled to adjust back to Championship football. It proved to be Green's worst season as Norwich's number one, keeping just seven clean sheets in 42 league appearances. Green missed the last few matches of 2005‚Äì06 after he sustained an injury in the warm-up prior to the away fixture against Sheffield Wednesday. In August 2006, Norwich accepted a bid of up to ¬£2 million from West Ham United for Green. ===West Ham United=== Green playing for West Ham United in 2006 Green signed a four-year deal with West Ham United, where he teamed up with former Norwich striker, Dean Ashton who had been sold to West Ham in January 2006. Green made his debut for West Ham on 19 October 2006 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Two of his best performances were when West Ham won 1‚Äì0 against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium\\"Green fingers revive Hammers' prospects\\". The Guardian. London. 9 April 2007. Retrieved 23 June 2007. and against Manchester United where he helped his team to a 1‚Äì0 win,\\"Manchester United v West Ham United, 0‚Äì1\\" . Premier League. 13 May 2007. Retrieved 23 June 2007. which preserved West Ham's Premier League status. Green kept nine clean sheets in 26 appearances during the league season. In 2007‚Äì08, Green saved the first three penalties taken against him. The first, against Kevin Doyle of Reading, the second, Benjani of Portsmouth in injury time, and the third from Tottenham's Jermain Defoe, again in injury time. The streak was ended by James McFadden of Birmingham City on 9 February 2008. He played in every match and was named the West Ham Hammer of the Year with the team finishing in 10th place in the Premier League. Green warming up for West Ham United in 2008 In 2008‚Äì09, Green saved yet another penalty, this time on 30 August 2008 against Jason Roberts of Blackburn Rovers, West Ham then went on to win the match 4‚Äì1. Green played all 38 league matches for West Ham in that season, keeping ten clean sheets. And again played in all 38 league matches for West Ham in 2009‚Äì10, keeping eight clean sheets and saving yet another penalty, this time from Aston Villa's Ashley Young in a 2‚Äì1 victory. Green made 44 appearances in all competitions during 2010‚Äì11, keeping seven clean sheets. He saved a penalty in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Wigan Athletic at Upton Park and then again against Stoke City in a 2‚Äì1 FA Cup defeat. On 19 March 2011, Green made a world-class save against Gareth Bale's free kick in the 0‚Äì0 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. He was named Hammer of the Year as runner-up to Scott Parker. Green was sent off for the first time in his club career against Blackpool on 21 February 2012. West Ham, who had not named a substitute goalkeeper in their squad for the match, were forced to play the remainder of the second-half with midfielder Henri Lansbury in goal. They eventually won 4‚Äì1. West Ham later won an appeal against the red card leaving Green available to play in their next match. He played 42 of West Ham's 46 match 2011‚Äì12 Championship season playing in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium which West Ham United won, sealing their immediate return into the Premier League. In June 2012, having failed to agree new terms with West Ham at the end of his contract, Green's departure from the club was announced. ===Queens Park Rangers=== Green playing for Queens Park Rangers in 2014 Green agreed terms with Queens Park Rangers (QPR) on 21 June 2012, and joined on a free transfer on 1 July, on a two-year contract.\\"QPR swoop for keeper Green\\". ESPN. 21 June 2012. Retrieved 17 September 2016. He made his debut on 18 August 2012 in a 5‚Äì0 home defeat by Swansea City. Green played only two more matches for QPR before manager Mark Hughes signed Brazilian international J√∫lio C√©sar; although Green played the next match against Manchester City, this was only because J√∫lio C√©sar's work permit was not complete and the Brazilian started the following match, against Chelsea on 15 September 2012. After the sacking of Hughes, new manager Harry Redknapp replaced Julio C√©sar with Green at half time during his first match in charge, against Sunderland on 27 November 2012. Green then went on to play the next five matches. before being once again relegated to the bench for most of the next 4 months, only starting three matches between 26 December and 20 April, two FA Cup matches in January then coming on when J√∫lio C√©sar was injured in the victory over Southampton and playing the following match as the Brazilian recovered. Redknapp said following Green's third successive start in the loss to Arsenal that for the remainder of the season he \\"want[s] to play Rob Green\\" and that Green \\"will probably be [his] goalkeeper next season\\", as he expected J√∫lio C√©sar to be sold over the summer. At the start of 2013‚Äì14, Green was named as first choice goalkeeper for the opening matches of the season. Green was a member of the QPR team that won the 2014 Championship play-off Final, 1‚Äì0 against Derby County at Wembley Stadium on 24 May 2014. After a single season back in the Premier League, QPR were relegated after a 6‚Äì0 away defeat to Manchester City on 10 May 2015, Green's fourth relegation from the Premier League. Earlier in the season, on 26 December, he saved an early penalty in an eventual 2‚Äì1 loss to Arsenal, as his teammate Eduardo Vargas pointed out which way fellow Chilean Alexis S√°nchez was likely to shoot. After starting 2015‚Äì16 as QPR's first choice goalkeeper, Green was frozen out the starting line-up one match after the arrival of new manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink due to a clause in his contract triggering a contract extension if he played 30 Championship matches. With QPR wanting to reduce the wage bill, Green left the club upon the expiry of his contract at the end of 2015‚Äì16, after a move to Premier League club Crystal Palace fell through in the January transfer window. ===Leeds United=== On 6 July 2016, Green signed a one-year contract with Championship club Leeds United. On 7 August 2016, Green made his Leeds debut against QPR in a 3‚Äì0 defeat, in which he failed to punch a ball from a corner leading to a Sol Bamba own goal. Green was the match winner in the next match on 10 August 2016 in the League Cup against Fleetwood Town, when he saved a penalty from Fleetwood's Eggert J√≥nsson in a 5‚Äì4 penalty shoot-out victory after a 2‚Äì2 extra-time draw His first clean sheet came on 20 August 2016 in a 2‚Äì0 win against Sheffield Wednesday. On 20 November 2016, Green committed a high-profile error when he dropped the ball under his crossbar onto the foot of Newcastle United striker Dwight Gayle to tap the ball home in a 2‚Äì0 defeat. On 17 December 2016, Green kept his 8th League clean sheet for Leeds, this equalled the tally already for Leeds' clean sheet for the whole of the previous 2015/16 season with goalkeeper predecessor Marco Silvestri. On 25 January 2017, Green kept his 6th consecutive clean sheet for home matches at Elland Road in a 2‚Äì0 win over Nottingham Forest. After making his 600th league appearance, on 26 February 2017, Green saved a penalty from Sheffield Wednesday striker Jordan Rhodes in Leeds' 1‚Äì0 victory. After impressing during his first season at the club, on 18 March 2017, Green signed a new one-year contract at the club. Green started the 2017/18 season under new head coach Thomas Christiansen as the club's second choice goalkeeper behind new signing Felix Wiedwald, and made his only appearance of the season on 22 August 2017 in Leeds' 5‚Äì1 League Cup victory against Newport County. After the signing of Andy Lonergan on 27 August 2017, Leeds reached a mutual termination the same day with Green to allow him to move to Premier League side Huddersfield Town. ===Huddersfield Town=== On 27 August 2017, Green signed for Premier League club Huddersfield Town on a contract until the end of 2017‚Äì18, after his contract with Leeds United was mutually terminated. Green failed to make a single first-team appearance for Huddersfield and in May 2018, the club announced that his contract would not be renewed. ===Chelsea=== Green signed for Premier League club Chelsea on 26 July 2018 on a one-year contract to provide cover for Thibaut Courtois and Willy Caballero. In March 2019 he spoke about being a third-choice goalkeeper, stating that \\"you don't get that same motivation\\" and \\"there is not the same commitment in a physical or mental sense\\". Despite not even being on the bench for the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final or any other Chelsea game during the season, Green celebrated by lifting the Europa League trophy after Chelsea beat Arsenal 4‚Äì1 on 29 May 2019. On 31 May 2019, Green announced his retirement from playing. ==International career== England before the 2010 FIFA World Cup match against the U.S. Green earned his first call-up to the full England squad in 2004 while at Norwich.\\"Happy to be here\\" .

He did not make Fabio Capello's first England team in February 2008. Green showed a sense of humour about the international situation, sporting gloves with 'England's No.6' embroidered on them. He was recalled to the squad in place of the injured Chris Kirkland for England's friendly with France on 26 March 2008. On 6 June 2009 Green made his first England start in their 4‚Äì0 win in Almaty against Kazakhstan in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier. He played for England against Croatia on 9 September 2009 with England securing a place in South Africa with a 5‚Äì1 victory. On 10 October 2009, he became the first ever England goalkeeper to be sent off, during the penultimate match of qualification against Ukraine, for a professional foul on Artem Milevskiy early in the match. England went on to lose 1‚Äì0. Green playing for England in 2012 Green was named in England's squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Manager Fabio Capello opted not to name his first choice goalkeeper until the day of England's opening match, against the United States on 12 June, at which point he selected Green to start. With England leading 1‚Äì0 in the 40th minute, Green failed to save a long-range shot from U.S. midfielder Clint Dempsey, which bounced off his gloves and into the net. The match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Following this error and an unconvincing final training session on 17 June, Green was dropped. He was replaced by David James who played in England's next match, a 0‚Äì0 draw against Algeria on 18 June. He did not appear again in the World Cup and was omitted from the first England squad named after the tournament for a friendly against Hungary. Green was brought back into the squad for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro in October 2010. On 16 May 2012, new England manager Roy Hodgson named Green as part of his 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2012. On 26 May, he made his first appearance since the World Cup, and kept a clean sheet as England defeated Norway 1‚Äì0 in a friendly. ==Personal life== In the summer of 2008, Green climbed Mount Kilimanjaro during a charity event for AMREF (the African Medical and Research Foundation). He is a fan of Woking and cited the club's long-time custodian Laurence Batty as another goalkeeping inspiration. Green stated in an interview with Leeds United that he is studying at the Open University for a BA Hons Business Management Degree in order to have something to focus on after he retires from football. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== { class= style=text-align:center + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2FA Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Europe !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=10Norwich City 1998‚Äì99 First Division 200000colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî20 - 1999‚Äì2000 First Division 300000colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî30 - 2000‚Äì01 First Division 500000colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî50 - 2001‚Äì02 First Division 4102010colspan=2‚Äî30470 - 2002‚Äì03 First Division 4603010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî500 - 2003‚Äì04 First Division 4601010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî480 - 2004‚Äì05 Premier League 3801020colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî410 - 2005‚Äì06 Championship 4201020colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî450 - 2006‚Äì07 Championship 00colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî00 - !colspan=2Total !22308070colspan=2‚Äî302410 - rowspan=7West Ham United 2006‚Äì07 Premier League 260001000colspan=2‚Äî270 - 2007‚Äì08 Premier League 3802010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî410 - 2008‚Äì09 Premier League 3804010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî430 - 2009‚Äì10 Premier League 3801020colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî410 - 2010‚Äì11 Premier League 3704030colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî440 - 2011‚Äì12 Championship 4200000colspan=2‚Äî30450 - !colspan=2Total !21901108000302410 - rowspan=5Queens Park Rangers 2012‚Äì13 Premier League 1602010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî190 - 2013‚Äì14 Championship 4500000colspan=2‚Äî30480 - 2014‚Äì15 Premier League 3600000colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî360 - 2015‚Äì16 Championship 2400010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî250 - !colspan=2Total !12102020colspan=2‚Äî301280 - rowspan=3Leeds United 2016‚Äì17 Championship 4600010colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî470 - 2017‚Äì18 Championship 00colspan=2‚Äî10colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî10 - !colspan=2Total !4600020colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî480 - Huddersfield Town 2017‚Äì18 Premier League 0000colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî00 - Chelsea 2018‚Äì19 Premier League 000000000000 - !colspan=3Career total !609021019000906580 } ===International=== :Source: { class= style=text-align:center + Appearances and goals by national team and year - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=4England 200510 - 200970 - 201030 - 201210 - !colspan=2Total120 } ==Honours== Norwich City *Football League First Division: 2003‚Äì04 West Ham United *Football League Championship play-offs: 2012 Queens Park Rangers *Football League Championship play-offs: 2014 Individual *PFA Team of the Year: 2003‚Äì04 First Division *West Ham United Hammer of the Year: 2007‚Äì08 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Chertsey Category:Footballers from Surrey Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:England youth international footballers Category:England B international footballers Category:England international footballers Category:2010 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2012 players ","title":"Robert Green"},{"id":"1433227","text":"Reddersburg is a small ship and cattle farming town in the Free State province of South Africa on the N6 National Route 50 kilometres south of Bloemfontein. ==History== The town was established around the Reformed Church Reddersburg, which was established on the farm Thorbeck on 7 May 1859.

The town was managed by the church until 1894 when it was handed over to the municipality on agreement that a hereditary tenure of 33 pounds sterling must be paid by the municipality to the church on an annual basis. During the Second Boer War, Reddersburg was the site of one of the last victories for the Boer forces over the British.

The events occurred just outside RAF Woodbridge, which was used at the time by the United States Air Force (USAF). USAF personnel, including deputy base commander Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt, claimed to see things they described as a UFO sighting. The occurrence is the most famous of claimed UFO events to have happened in the United Kingdom, ranking among the best-known reported UFO events worldwide. It has been compared to the Roswell UFO incident in the United States and is sometimes referred to as \\"Britain's Roswell\\". The UK Ministry of Defence stated the event posed no threat to national security, and it therefore never was investigated as a security matter. Sceptics have explained the sightings as a misinterpretation of a series of nocturnal lights: a fireball, the Orfordness Lighthouse and bright stars. ==Main events== ===26 December=== Around 03:00 on 26 December 1980 (reported as 27 December by Halt in his memo to the UK Ministry of Defence) a security patrol near the east gate of RAF Woodbridge saw lights apparently descending into nearby Rendlesham Forest. These lights have been attributed by astronomers to a piece of natural debris seen burning up as a fireball over southern England at that time. Servicemen initially thought it was a downed aircraft but, upon entering the forest to investigate they saw, according to Halt's memo, what they described as a glowing object, metallic in appearance, with coloured lights. As they attempted to approach the object, it appeared to move through the trees, and \\"the animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy\\". One of the servicemen, Sergeant Jim Penniston, later claimed to have encountered a \\"craft of unknown origin\\" while in the forest, although there was no publicised mention of this at the time and there is no corroboration from other witnesses. Shortly after 04:00 local police were called to the scene but reported that the only lights they could see were those from the Orford Ness lighthouse, some miles away on the coast. After daybreak on the morning of 26 December, servicemen returned to a small clearing near the eastern edge of the forest and found three small impressions on the ground in a triangular pattern, as well as burn marks and broken branches on nearby trees. At 10:30 the local police were called out again, this time to see the impressions, which they thought could have been made by an animal. Georgina Bruni, in her book You Can't Tell the People, published a photograph of the supposed landing site taken on the morning after the first sighting.\\"Fax from Parliamentary Branch to DAS(SEC), 4 June 2001 8:50AM\\" (PDF). Ministry of Defence. ===28 December=== The deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, visited the site with several servicemen in the early hours of 28 December 1980 (reported as 29 December by Halt). They took radiation readings in the triangle of depressions and in the surrounding area using an AN/PDR-27, a standard U.S. military radiation survey meter. Although they recorded 0.07 milliroentgens per hour, in other regions they detected 0.03 to 0.04 milliroentgens per hour, around the background level. Furthermore, they detected a similar small 'burst' over half a mile away from the landing site. Halt recorded the events on a micro-cassette recorder (see ¬ß The Halt Tape, below). It was during this investigation that a flashing light was seen across the field to the east, almost in line with a farmhouse, as the witnesses had seen on the first night. The Orford Ness lighthouse is visible further to the east in the same line of sight (see below). Later, according to Halt's memo, three star-like lights were seen in the sky, two to the north and one to the south, about 10 degrees above the horizon. Halt said that the brightest of these hovered for two to three hours and seemed to beam down a stream of light from time to time. Astronomers have explained these star-like lights as bright stars. ==Location== Rendlesham Forest is owned by the Forestry Commission and consists of about of coniferous plantations, interspersed with broadleaved belts, heathland and wetland areas. It is located in the county of Suffolk, about east of the town of Ipswich. Map of local area The incident occurred in the vicinity of two former military bases: RAF Bentwaters, which is just to the north of the forest, and RAF Woodbridge which extends into the forest from the west and is bounded by the forest on its northern and eastern edges. At the time, both were being used by the United States Air Force and were under the command of wing commander Colonel Gordon E. Williams. The base commander was Colonel Ted Conrad, and his deputy was Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt. The main events of the incident, including the supposed landing or landings, took place in the forest, which starts at the east end of the base runway or about 0.3 miles (0.5 km) to the east of the East Gate of RAF Woodbridge, from where security guards first noticed mysterious lights appearing to descend into the forest. The forest extends east about one mile (1.6 km) beyond East Gate, ending at a farmer's field at Capel Green, where additional events allegedly took place. Orfordness Lighthouse, which sceptics identify as the flashing light seen off to the coast by the airmen, is along the same line of sight about further east of the forest's edge. At that time it was one of the brightest lighthouses in the UK. ==Primary and secondary sources== ===The Halt memo=== Letter from Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt to the UK Ministry of Defence. The first piece of primary evidence to be made available to the public was a memorandum written by the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt, to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Known as the \\"Halt memo\\", this was made publicly available in the United States under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act in 1983. The memorandum, was dated \\"13 Jan 1981\\" under the title \\"Unexplained Lights\\". The two-week delay between the incident and the report might account for errors in the dates and times given. The memo was not classified in any way. David Clarke, a consultant to the National Archives, has investigated the background of this memo and the reaction to it at the MoD. His interviews with the personnel involved confirmed the cursory nature of the investigation made by the MoD, and failed to find any evidence for any other reports on the incident made by the USAF or UK apart from the Halt memo. Halt has since gone on record as saying he believes that he witnessed an extraterrestrial event that was then covered up.\\"U.S. Nuclear Weapons Have Been Compromised by Unidentified Aerial Objects\\" . PR Newswire. Reuters.com. 15 September 2010; Halt's press conference statement, starting at 3:00, part 1; YouTube, part 2 ===The Halt Tape=== Recording made by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt during his investigation In 1984, a copy of what became known as the \\"Halt Tape\\" was released to UFO researchers by Colonel Sam Morgan, who had by then succeeded Ted Conrad as Halt's superior. This tape chronicles Halt's investigation in the forest in real time, including taking radiation readings, the sighting of the flashing light between trees, and the starlike objects that hovered and twinkled. The tape has been transcribed by researcher Ian Ridpath, who includes a link to an audio download and also a step-by-step analysis of the entire contents of the tape. ===Statements from eyewitnesses on 26 December=== In 1997, Scottish researcher James Easton obtained the original witness statements made by those involved in the first night‚Äôs sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: \\"We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance.\\" Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: \\"We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [3 km] before we could [see] it was coming from a lighthouse.\\" Burroughs reported a noise \\"like a woman was screaming\\" and also that \\"you could hear the farm animals making a lot of noises.\\" Halt heard the same noises two nights later. Such noise could have been made by Muntjac deer in the forest, which are known for their loud, shrill bark when alarmed. ===The Halt affidavit=== In June 2010, retired Colonel Charles Halt signed a notarised affidavit, in which he again summarised what had happened, then stated he believed the event to be extraterrestrial and it had been covered up by both the UK and US. Contradictions between this affidavit and the facts as recorded at the time in Halt's memo and tape recording have been pointed out.\\"Col Halt's affidavit\\". IanRidpath.com. Retrieved on 16 August 2011. In 2010, base commander Colonel Ted Conrad provided a statement about the incident to Clarke. Conrad stated that \\"We saw nothing that resembled Lieutenant Colonel Halt's descriptions either in the sky or on the ground\\" and that \\"We had people in position to validate Halt's narrative, but none of them could.\\" In an interview, Conrad criticised Halt for the claims in his affidavit, saying \\"he should be ashamed and embarrassed by his allegation that his country and Britain both conspired to deceive their citizens over this issue. He knows better.\\" Conrad also disputed the testimony of Sergeant Jim Penniston, who claimed to have touched an alien spacecraft; he said that he interviewed Penniston at the time and he had not mentioned any such occurrence. Conrad also suggested that the entire incident might have been a hoax. A 1983 Omni article says \\"Colonel Ted Conrad the base commander... recalls five Air Force policemen spotted lights from what they thought was a small plane descending into the forest. Two of the men tracked the object on foot and came upon a large tripod-mounted craft. It had no windows but was studded with brilliant red and blue lights. Each time the men came within 50 yards of the ship, Conrad relates, it levitated six feet in the air and backed away. They followed it for almost an hour through the woods and across a field until it took off at 'phenomenal speed.' Acting on the reports made by his men, Colonel Conrad began a brief investigation of the incident in the morning. He went into the forest and located a triangular pattern ostensibly made by the tripod legs. ...he did interview two of the eyewitnesses and concludes, 'Those lads saw something, but I don't know what it was'.\\"OMNI Magazine, March 1983, \\"UFO Update\\", p. 115 ===Suffolk police log=== Suffolk police were called to the scene on the night of the initial sighting and again the following morning but found nothing unusual. On the night of the initial incident they reported that the only lights visible were from the Orford lighthouse. They attributed the indentations in the ground to animals. The Suffolk constabulary file on the case was released in 2005 under the UK‚Äôs Freedom of Information Act and can be accessed on their website. It includes a letter dated 28 July 1999 written by Inspector Mike Topliss who notes that one of the police constables who attended the scene on the first night returned to the site in daylight in case he had missed something. \\"There was nothing to be seen and he remains unconvinced that the occurrence was genuine,\\" wrote Topliss. \\"The immediate area was swept by powerful light beams from a landing beacon at RAF Bentwaters and the Orfordness lighthouse. I know from personal experience that at night, in certain weather and cloud conditions, these beams were very pronounced and certainly caused strange visual effects.\\" ===Ministry of Defence file=== Evidence of a substantial MoD file on the subject led to claims of a cover-up; some interpreted this as part of a larger pattern of information suppression concerning the true nature of unidentified flying objects, by both the United States and British governments. However, when the file was released in 2001 it turned out to consist mostly of internal correspondence and responses to inquiries from the public. The lack of any in-depth investigation in the publicly released documents is consistent with the MoD's earlier statement that they never took the case seriously. Included in the released files is an explanation given by defence minister Lord Trefgarne as to why the MoD did not investigate further. ==Sceptical analysis== The Orfordness Lighthouse as seen from the south-west. A white shield blocked the light from the town of Orford but not from the forest where the sighting occurred. One proposed theory is that the incident was a hoax. The BBC reported that a former U.S. security policeman, Kevin Conde, claimed responsibility for creating strange lights in the forest by driving around in a police vehicle whose lights he had modified. However, there is no evidence that this prank took place on the nights in question. Other explanations for the incident have included a downed Soviet spy satellite, but no evidence has been produced to support this. The most plausible sceptical explanation is that the sightings were due to a combination of three main factors. The initial sighting at 03.00 on 26 December, when the airmen saw something apparently descending into the forest, coincided with the appearance of a bright fireball over southern England, and such fireballs are a common source of UFO reports. The supposed landing marks were identified by police and foresters as rabbit diggings. No evidence has emerged to confirm that anything actually came down in the forest. According to the witness statements from 26 December the flashing light seen from the forest lay in the same direction as the Orfordness Lighthouse. When the eyewitnesses attempted to approach the light they realised it was further off than they thought. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, described it as ‚Äúa beacon light off in the distance‚Äù while another, John Burroughs, said it was ‚Äúa lighthouse‚Äù (see Statements from eyewitnesses on 26 December, above). Timings on Halt‚Äôs tape recording during his sighting on 28 December indicate that the light he saw, which lay in the same direction as the light seen two nights earlier, flashed every five seconds, which was the flash rate of the Orfordness Lighthouse. The star-like objects that Halt reported hovering low to the north and south are thought by some sceptics to have been misinterpretations of bright stars distorted by atmospheric and optical effects, another common source of UFO reports. The brightest of them, to the south, matched the position of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. In his 6 January 2009 Skeptoid podcast episode titled \\"The Rendlesham Forest UFO,\\" scientific sceptic author Brian Dunning evaluated the original eye- witness reports and audio recordings, as well as the resulting media reporting of this incident. After a lengthy analysis Dunning concluded: ==UFO Trail== Forest clearing in the UFO Trail at Rendlesham Forest In 2005, the Forestry Commission used Lottery proceeds to create a trail in Rendlesham Forest because of public interest and nicknamed it the UFO Trail. In 2014, the Forestry Service commissioned an artist to create a work which has been installed at the end of the trail. The artist states the piece is modelled on sketches that purportedly represent some versions of the UFO claimed to have been seen at Rendlesham. == Change of heart == In 2010, Jenny Randles, who first reported the case in the London Evening Standard in 1981 and co-authored with the local researchers who uncovered the events, the first book on the case in 1984, Sky Crash: A Cosmic Conspiracy,Sky Crash: A Cosmic Conspiracy by Brenda Butler, Dot Street, and Jenny Randles, Neville Spearman, 1984, xii, 283 p., 12 p. of plates, . emphasised her previously expressed doubts that the incident was caused by extraterrestrial visitors. Whilst suggesting that a UAP, an unidentified atmospheric phenomenon of unknown origin, might have caused parts of the case, she noted: \\"Whilst some puzzles remain, we can probably say that no unearthly craft were seen in Rendlesham Forest. We can also argue with confidence that the main focus of the events was a series of misperceptions of everyday things encountered in less than everyday circumstances.\\"As quoted by Joe Nickell and James McGaha in The Roswellian Syndrome: How some UFO Myths Develop, Skeptical Inquirer, vol. 36.3, May/June 2012.Jenny Randles, Andy Roberts and David Clarke, The UFOs That Never Were, London House, 2000, p. 222. ==Possible hoax== In December 2018, David Clarke, a British UFO researcher, reported a claim that the incident was a set-up by the SAS as a revenge plot on the USAF.Who Dares Wins?: Britain‚Äôs Roswell meets the SAS According to this story, in August 1980, the SAS parachuted into RAF Woodbridge to test the security at the nuclear site. The USAF had recently upgraded their radar and detected the black parachutes of the SAS men as they descended to the base. The SAS troops were interrogated and beaten up, with the ultimate insult that they were called \\"unidentified aliens\\". To enact their revenge, the SAS \\"gave\\" the USAF their own version of an alien event; ==See also== * Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident * UFO conspiracy theory * Unidentified flying object * Paulding Light * List of reported UFO sightings * UFO sightings in United Kingdom * The Rendlesham UFO Incident, a 2014 film based on these events * The Rendlesham Forest incident is incorporated into BBC Radio 4's 2019 adaptation of H.

The town is at the centre of the wool producing area of the Transgariep. Rouxville is situated near a number of interesting locations - Zastron (30 km), Aliwal North (34 km), Smithfield (35 km), Gariep Dam (60 km) and Bethulie. Lady Grey, the Witteberg mountain range (with the 2,769 m Avoca peak) and the Drakensberg mountain range are also easily accessible from Rouxville, while the Lesotho border is ca. 70 km away. ==History== The town started after mail irregularities at Aliwal North led authorities to re-direct mail between the Cape Colony and the Orange Free State to the farm Zuurbult (founded by Petrus Wepenaar) in 1863. The distance between Smithfield and Aliwal North (70 km) was allegedly too long to be travelled in one day by horse and wagon, and as such Rouxville was created as the halfway stopover. The town was established in 1864 and named after Dutch Reformed Church Reverend Pieter Roux of the Smithfield parish. Roux traveled throughout the Eastern Free State for many years holding church services for local communities. During the Second Boer War, all of the town's citizens were called up for military service and the town was completely deserted for two years. A former State President of the Republic of South Africa, Jacobus Johannes (Jim) Fouch√© (1898-1980), grew up on the family farm in Rouxville, where he first attended school. He later returned to Rouxville after College and became one of the leading farmers of the region. As a leader of the community in the wider Southeast Free State area, he entered politics when he was elected a member of the South African Parliament on the ticket of the Reunited National Party, representing nearby Smithfield (1941-1950), was appointed Administrator of the Orange Free State (1951-1959), served also as Defence Minister (1959-1965) and Minister of Agricultural technical services and water affairs (1966-1968) in the Governments of Verwoerd and Vorster. He was again elected to Parliament, this time representing Bloemfontein West (1960-1968). He was the second choice as successor to Charles Swart as State President, but was defeated by Theophilus Ebenhaezer Donges, however when Donges failed to assume office because of poor health, he emerged as a compromise candidate and was nominated by the Parliamentary caucus of the National Party as State President and served his entire 7-year term (1968-1975). ==Notes== ==External links== Category:Populated places in the Mohokare Local Municipality Category:Populated places established in 1863 Category:1863 establishments in the Orange Free State ","title":"Rouxville"},{"id":"1433241","text":"Never may refer to: ==Songs== *\\"Never\\" (Heart song), 1985 *\\"Never\\" (Jaheim song), 2008 *\\"Never\\" (Keyshia Cole song), 2005 *\\"Never\\" (Kristine W song), 2008 *\\"Never\\" (Moving Pictures song), 1984 *\\"Never\\" (Ozzy Osbourne song), 1986 *\\"Never (Past Tense)\\", a 2003 song by the Roc Project and Tina Arena *\\"Never\\" (Produce 101 song), song by the contestants of Produce 101 Season 2 *\\"Never\\", by Electrafixion from the 1995 album Burned *\\"Never\\", by The House of Love from the 1990 album The House of Love *\\"Never\\", by Jomanda, 1993 *\\"Never\\", by Marcus & Martinus from the 2017 album Moments *\\"Never\\", by Moby Grape from the 1968 album Wow/Grape Jam, with lyrics later used by Led Zeppelin in ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôve Been Loving You‚Äù *\\"Never\\", by Sevendust from the 2005 album Next ==Places== *Never, Amur Oblast, a rural locality on the A360 Lena Highway *Never, a crater on Mars *Nevers, a commune in central France ==Other uses== *NEVER (professional wrestling), a series of professional wrestling events held by New Japan Pro Wrestling *Never (Micachu and the Shapes album), 2012 *Never (Mie album) *Never (film), 2014 drama written and directed by Brett Allen Smith ==See also== *Never Say Goodbye (disambiguation) *Never Say Never (disambiguation) *Never Surrender (disambiguation) *Never Too Much (disambiguation) *Nevermore (disambiguation) *\\"Never Never\\" (The Assembly song), 1993 single by the Vince Clarke project *\\"Never, never, never\\", 1973 song by Shirley Bassey * * ","title":"Never"},{"id":"1433243","text":"Zhou Xuan (; born Su Pu ; August 1, 1920 - September 22, 1957), also romanized as Chow Hsuan, was an iconic Chinese singer and film actress. By the 1940s, she had become one of China's Seven Great Singing Stars. She was the best known of the seven, nicknamed the \\"Golden Voice\\", and had a concurrent movie career until 1954. She recorded more than 200 songs and appeared in over 40 films in her career. ==Early life== Zhou was born Su Pu (ËòáÁíû), but was separated from her natural parents at a young age and raised by adoptive parents. She spent her entire life searching for her biological parents but her parentage was never established until after her death. According to later family research, a relative who was an opium addict took her at the age of 3 to another city and sold her to a family named Wang, who named her Wang Xiaohong. She was later adopted by a family named Zhou, changing her name to Zhou Xiaohong. At the age of 13, she took Zhou Xuan as her stage name, 'Xuan' () meaning beautiful jade in Chinese. ==Career== hand-coloured photo of Zhou in the 1930s. In 1932, Zhou began acting as a member of Li Jinhui's Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe. When she was twelve, she won second prize in a singing contest in Shanghai and was given the nickname \\"Golden Voice\\" () for her effortless high-pitched melodies. Zhou began her film career in 1935, and she achieved stardom in 1937 when director Yuan Muzhi cast her as one of the leads as a singing girl in Street Angel. Zhou rapidly became the most famous and marketable popular singer in the gramophone era up to her death, singing many famous tunes from her own movies. Between 1946 and 1950, she often went to Hong Kong to make films such as \\"All-Consuming Love\\" (), \\"Hua wai liu ying\\" (), Sorrows of the Forbidden City, and \\"Rainbow Song\\" (). After introducing \\"Shanghai Nights\\" () in 1949, Zhou returned to Shanghai. She spent the next few years in and out of a mental institutions owing to frequent breakdowns. Through the years, Zhou led a complicated and unhappy life marked by her failed marriages, illegitimate children, and suicide attempts. Zhou's first husband was the composer Yan Hua (Âö¥ËèØ, 1912‚Äì1992), who wrote and sometimes also performed songs with her. Despite having made a total of 43 movies, her favorite film remained Street Angel. This contained two theme songs: \\"Four Seasons Song\\" () and \\"The Wandering Songstress\\", which enjoyed long-lasting popularity. Other well-known songs by Zhou Xuan include \\"When Will You Return?\\", \\"Shanghai Nights\\" (title song from the film of the same name), \\"Yellow Leaves Dancing in the Autumn Wind\\" (), \\"Eternal Smile\\" (), \\"Hundred Flower Song\\" (), \\"Advice\\" (), \\"Where Can the Soul Mate be Found\\" (), and \\"Picking Betel Nuts\\" (). ==Death== In 1957 she died in Shanghai in a mental asylum at the age of 37 during the Anti-Rightist Movement. A possible cause of death may be encephalitis following a nervous breakdown. Zhou's diary concluded that she suffered from cerebritis. Zhou Xuan was survived by two sons, Zhou Min and Zhou Wei, born of different fathers. Zhou Min was widely believed to be the son of the businessman Zhu Huaide, who left for Shanghai in 1950 after Zhou Xuan entrusted him with her savings and never returned, Zhou Min was born on that same year. According to her elder son Zhou Min's biography, her younger son, Zhou Wei, was the son of the art designer Tang Di (), while the biological father of Zhou Min himself was not revealed. Zhou Wei currently lives in Toronto performing at times in the TTC subways, and participating in various musical projects, including teaching. He is known as a flautist. He has two daughters, both musicians. The elder of the two, Zhou Xiaoxuan, is a classical pianist trained at Concordia University and now living in Beijing. The youngest, Amanda Zhou, is taking a similar path as an actress and has already worked on a few shows and films. ==Cultural legacy== To this day, Zhou Xuan's songs still remain a staple in many Golden Oldies collections in Mandarin popular music. There have been two biographies written by Zhou Xuan's surviving family members. The book My Mother Zhou Xuan () was written by Zhou Wei and his wife Chang Jing (); while a later book, Zhou Xuan Diary (), was written by Zhou Min. ===Television=== Zhou Xuan An adaptation of the life of Zhou Xuan was TVB's Song Bird (1989), starring Adia Chan as Zhou Xuan and Leon Lai as her lover. In this series, Xuan's songs were re-written in Cantonese and sung by Chan. She sang the duets with Lai in the program while under the limits of Crown Records (). Deric Wan replaced Lai's vocals on the soundtrack album. Another adaptation, based on Zhou Wei's biography, is the Chinese serial titled Zhou Xuan (), starring Cecilia Cheung. This version of the story was accused by Zhou Wei as a false representation of Zhou Xuan and damaging to the reputation of the Zhou family. ==Filmography== * ÁãÇÊ≠°‰πãÂ§ú (1935) * Street Angel (È¶¨Ë∑ØÂ§©‰Ωø, 1937) * Ë•øÂªÇË®ò (1940) * Â≠üÈ∫óÂêõ (1940) * Dream of the Red Chamber (Á∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶, 1944) * Night Inn (Â§úÂ∫ó, 1947) * Èï∑Áõ∏ÊÄù (1947) * Sorrows of the Forbidden City (Ê∏ÖÂÆÆÁßòÂè≤, 1948) * Ëä±Â§ñÊµÅÈ∂Ø (1948) * Ê≠åÂ•≥‰πãÊ≠å (1948) * Ëé´Ë≤†ÈùíÊò• (1949) * Ëä±Ë°ó (1950) ==See also== * C-pop, an overview of Chinese popular music ** Mandopop, the Mandarin-language subgenre ** Cantopop, for popular music performed in Cantonese * Seven Great Singing Stars ==References* Zhou Xuan at the Chinese Movie Database * Category:1920 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Actresses from Changzhou Category:Mandarin-language singers Category:Chinese female singers Category:Musicians from Changzhou Category:Republic of China singers Category:20th-century Chinese actresses Category:Chinese adoptees Category:Victims of human rights abuses Category:Singers from Jiangsu Category:Political abuses of psychiatry Category:Chinese film actresses Category:20th-century Chinese singers Category:Burials in Shanghai Category:20th-century women singers ","title":"Zhou Xuan"},{"id":"1433245","text":"Gyula may refer to: * Gyula (title), Hungarian title of the 9th‚Äì10th century * Gyula (name), Hungarian male given name, derived from the title ; People * Gyula II, the gyula who was baptized in Constantinople around 950 * Gyula III, the gyula who was defeated by King Stephen I around 1003 ; Places * Gyula, Hungary, town in Hungary * Gyulah√°za, village in Hungary * Gyulakeszi, village in Hungary * Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, Hungarian name of Alba Iulia, Romania ja:„Ç∏„É•„É© ","title":"Gyula"},{"id":"1433246","text":"Schilcher is a wine produced solely in the Austrian region of Western Styria (Weststeiermark), in the districts of Deutschlandsberg and Voitsberg, sharing a border with Slovenia and Carinthia to the south and west.

The grape was once a wild variety which was said to contain alcohol compounds which, in turn, allegedly would induce wild inebriation, hence its colloquial name Rabiatperle - rabid pearl.

The sites collaborate with the other Scandinavian Wikipedias through the Skanwiki section of the Wikimedia Foundation's Meta-Wiki site. One effect of this combined effort is the sharing of their weekly featured front- page articles among these four different Wikipedias. While the ISO 639 two- letter code for Bokm√•l is nb, the Bokm√•l/Riksm√•l Norwegian Wikipedia continues to be hosted at no.wikipedia.org, while the narrower nb code redirects to that site.

He is best known as the lead singer, songwriter, and co- founder of English synth-pop band The Human League. Aside from The Human League, he has had an extensive solo music career and collaborated with numerous other artists and producers. Oakey was one of the most visually distinctive music artists of the early 1980s. At the height of their success, The Human League released the triple platinum-certified album Dare and Oakey co-wrote and sang the multi-million-selling single \\"Don't You Want Me\\", which was a number one single in both the U.S. and UK, where it remains the 28th- highest-selling single of all time. Oakey has been lead singer of The Human League for over 40 years, with whom he has sold more than 20 million records worldwide. He continues recording and performing internationally. ==Early life== Oakey was born on 2 October 1955 in Hinckley, Leicestershire. His father worked for the General Post Office and moved jobs regularly: the family moved to Coventry when Oakey was an infant, to Leeds when he was five and to Birmingham when he was nine, attending Catherine-de-Barnes primary school near Solihull, and gaining a scholarship to the independent Solihull School. He settled in Sheffield when he was fourteen. He was educated at King Edward VII School in Sheffield. He left school at 18 without finishing his exams and worked in a number of casual jobs: in a university bookshop, and from 1975 as a porter at Thornbury Annex Hospital in Sheffield. He was married briefly to his girlfriend, whom he met at school, but the marriage did not last long and they were divorced in 1980. ==Entry into music== Oakey's entry into music in 1977 was entirely accidental. He had bought a saxophone but had given up trying to learn how to play it, and had no aspiration to be in a pop group. In Sheffield in 1977, a school friend of Oakey's, Martyn Ware, along with Ian Craig Marsh and Adi NewtonAdi Newton later went on to form Clock DVA in 1978 had formed a band called The Future. They were part of an emerging genre of music that used analogue synthesisers instead of traditional instruments, which would later be called synth-pop. Although they had recorded a number of demo tapes, they remained unsigned. Newton left the band after they were turned down by record companies. Ware decided that The Future needed a dedicated lead singer to replace Newton. His first choice, Glenn Gregory, was unavailable. So Ware suggested his old school friend Philip Oakey to Marsh. Although Oakey had no musical experience, he was well known in the Sheffield social scene, principally for his eclectic dress sense and classic motorcycle. Ware went to visit Oakey to ask him to join The Future; finding him away from home, he left a note on Oakey's front door asking him to join. Oakey accepted and joined the band in mid-1977. ==Human League career== In late 1977, The Future changed its name to The Human League‚Äîafter an element of a science fiction board game. The new band played their first live gig at Psalter Lane Arts College in June 1978 (a blue plaque now marks the spot) and signed to Fast Records. The early Human League had a reputation for being arty and had very little commercial success, releasing two singles, \\"Being Boiled\\" and \\"Empire State Human\\", with lyrics written by Oakey. They would eventually release two albums, Reproduction (1979) and Travelogue (1980), both recorded at the band's Monumental Pictures studio. Reproduction failed to chart, but after an impromptu appearance on Top of the Pops in May 1980, Travelogue entered the UK Album Chart and peaked at No.16. Despite this, the band still had no hit singles and, dogged by the lack of commercial success, Oakey and Ware's working relationship became increasingly strained. In October 1980, on the eve of a European tour, it reached breaking point and Ware walked out taking Marsh with him. Oakey and director of visuals Adrian Wright were permitted to retain the band name but would be responsible for all band debts and the tour commitment. Ware and Marsh soon recruited Glenn Gregory and became Heaven 17. Facing financial ruin with the tour promoters threatening to sue him, Oakey had less than a week to put a new band together. In an unplanned move Oakey went to a Sheffield city centre discoth√®que called The Crazy Daisy (Subsequently, The Geisha Bar, now a row of shops) and recruited two totally unknown teenage girls he saw dancing there: Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall into the band. As luck would have it, they were already fans of the Human League and recognised Oakey. He now calls this the best decision of his career, as the girls would be critical in the band's further success, and Sulley and Catherall are now Oakey's business partners in the present-day band. After the tour, the band had their first UK Top 20 hit, \\"The Sound of the Crowd\\", in April 1981. Now with the addition of Jo Callis and Ian Burden, the band became a six-piece and went on to release the single \\"Love Action (I Believe In Love)\\" which became a Top 3 hit in the UK. This was followed by \\"Open Your Heart\\", which became another Top 10 hit. Soon afterwards they released a full album, Dare, much of it written by Oakey. Dare would soon become a number-one album in the UK and achieve multi-platinum status. At the end of 1981, the fourth and final single from the album, \\"Don't You Want Me\\", gave the band their first number one and went on to sell over 1.5 million in the UK, staying at number one for five weeks. It also topped the chart in the US the following year, selling another million copies there. By the end of 1981/82 Oakey and the Human League would be famous worldwide. Oakey had a relationship with Catherall, and later, Sulley. He and Catherall's lasted several years; the pair remain friends. The remainder of the 1980s saw the band's success peak and dip, with the follow-up release of the album Hysteria in 1984 underachieving. In 1986, Oakey accepted an offer to work with US producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis which resulted in the release of the album Crash and the single \\"Human\\" which became another international hit and went to number one in the US. However, by 1987, the band had lost most of its members leaving only Oakey, Sulley and Catherall. In 1989, Oakey persuaded Sheffield City Council to invest a business development loan for the building of Human League Studios in Sheffield, Oakey's dedicated studio for the band and a commercial venture. The 1990 album Romantic? underperformed commercially, peaking at #24 in the UK and in 1992, Virgin Records cancelled the band's recording contract. This had a devastating effect on the band, causing Oakey to seek counselling for depression, and Sulley to have a breakdown. Oakey recalled in 1995: \\"We watched Romantic disappear without a trace. Gone, gone into the past with all you've hoped for. [‚Ä¶] About that time, I think, I had a low-grade nervous breakdown.\\" The emotional problems of the pair nearly caused the band to break up. Thanks mainly to the efforts of Catherall, by 1993 Oakey and Sulley had recovered and the band was back on its feet. They signed to East West Records which resulted in the release of the gold-selling album Octopus in 1995 and the hit singles \\"Tell Me When\\" and \\"One Man in My Heart\\". Another change of record label saw the release of the critically acclaimed Secrets album in 2001. Secrets failed to sell because the record label went into receivership, curtailing promotion. After the failure of a project he had put so much work and time into, Oakey lost faith in the record industry and changed the band's focus to more lucrative live work. Between 2002 and the present day, they have toured regularly either on their own or as guests at festivals. They have played at such prestigious events as V Festival, Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim and to 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles in 2006. In 2011, the band released a new album, Credo. Though the album was commercially unsuccessful, the band continues to tour regularly. ==Solo and collaborative career== Oakey has worked on his own, and also with other artists and producers. His first collaboration was producing the Spanish-released single \\"Amor Secreto\\" by Nick Fury in 1983 for which he also played synthesiser, together with Jo Callis. His highest profile and most commercially successful collaboration was with producer Giorgio Moroder. In 1984 for the film Electric Dreams, he and Moroder provided the film theme song, \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\". When later released as a single it would go on to become an international hit. The song went on to become a bigger hit than some of Oakey's Human League singles of the same period. In 1985, Oakey and Moroder released the joint album Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder which generated two further single releases, \\"Be My Lover Now\\" and \\"Good-Bye Bad Times\\". Released in both the UK and US, these singles were not as successful as \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\" and the Oakey/Moroder partnership effectively ended. In 1990, Oakey provided guest vocals on \\"What Comes After Goodbye\\", the one-off release by the short-lived Sheffield dance band, Respect. In 1991, Oakey was involved with Vic Reeves on the track \\"Black Night\\" which is a Deep Purple cover. In 1999, he provided vocals for the single \\"1st Man in Space\\" by the Sheffield band All Seeing I. The song was written by Jarvis Cocker. In 2003, he provided vocals for Sheffield band Kings Have Long Arms on the single \\"Rock and Roll is Dead\\"; also in 2003 he worked with producer/DJ Alex Gold and they released the trance single \\"LA Today\\". In 2008, Oakey worked with Hiem, a band fronted by former All Seeing I lead singer David \\"Bozz\\" Boswell, on the song \\"2 am\\". In early 2009, Oakey collaborated with the Pet Shop Boys on their tenth studio album Yes, supplying vocals for the intended bonus disc song \\"This Used to Be the Future\\". Also in 2009, Oakey collaborated with British female synthpop artist Little Boots on her first album, Hands, recording the duet track \\"Symmetry\\". ==Fashion style== Throughout his career and in his personal life, Oakey has been a flamboyant dresser and fashion trend-setter. His outrageous dress sense and original hairstyle would make him an iconic figure of the early 1980s music scene. Before 1977, during the era of punk rock, Oakey adopted various styles; at one time having a crew cut, he later had collar-length hair and once turned up in a club wearing a household power lead with plug as a necklace. He also often wore bike leathers and rode a classic Norton motorcycle around Sheffield. Ware, who sought commercial success, reasoned that half the battle was won \\"as Oakey already looked like a pop star\\". Soon after The Future transformed into the Human League, Oakey wanted a look that would make him stand out from other lead singers. After spotting a girl on a Sheffield bus with a Veronica Lake hairstyle, Oakey was inspired to adopt a strange lopsided geometric hairstyle, shoulder length on one side and short on the other. Between 1978 and 1979 with his unique hairstyle, he maintained a masculine dress style and at one time wore a full beard. In 1979, inspired by the 1970s glam rock style of Brian Eno, Oakey began wearing makeup. His style became increasingly more feminine, including the use of bright red lipstick. By 1981, after the formation of the new Human League, Oakey's trademark style of the early 1980s was complete. As well as full makeup, Oakey had begun wearing androgynous clothing. The addition of teenage school girls Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall as vocalists to the band in 1980 complemented his look. At times, all three would wear the same eyeliner and lipstick. Oakey and Catherall, who were to enter into a relationship with each other, often looked and dressed almost identically. The media regularly commented and joked about his style. Oakey pushed his style further and began wearing high-heeled shoes. He already had both his ears pierced and wore dangling women's diamante earrings. Keen to shock, on one of the Human League's posters in 1981 Oakey posed shirtless, displaying pierced nipples linked together by a gold chain. Oakey says of his early-1980s style: \\"I deliberately wore clothes that either men or women could wear. But I don't think I ever really looked like a woman. And I never wore very masculine clothes\\". It wasn't just a stage look. Oakey openly went about in public in full makeup, dressed in his eclectic style. \\"Sheffield was so accepting,\\" he claimed, \\"that no one ever blinked an eyelid\\". By 1983 Oakey wanted to change his androgynous look. He adopted a more macho image of denim, collar-length hair and 'designer stubble'. For the Crash album of 1986, Oakey adopted a smoother style of designer clothes and a manicured look which he says was inspired by Sean Young's character Rachael from the film Blade Runner. By 1990, the Human League had begun to decline. For their Romantic? album, Oakey wore denim, leather and readopted his lop-sided hairstyle from 1981 in a rebellion against \\"the male model look of Crash\\". The band went through dark times and the style was quickly abandoned. When the band returned in a comeback in 1995, the 40-year-old Oakey reappeared with designer clothes and a suave, short, neat hair cut. In 1999, after beginning to develop male pattern baldness, Oakey adopted an all-over 'number two' crop hairstyle. This is the style he wears today. Oakey now generally wears a simple Armani suit on stage. He has a prince albert piercing, stating in 2007, \\"Yes, I have a Prince Albert ring. I had it done about six years ago. It didn't hurt too much ... when I pierced my ear it hurt more!\\" ==Discography== ===With the Human League=== ;Studio albums *Reproduction (1979) *Travelogue (1980) *Dare (1981) *Love and Dancing (1982) *Hysteria (1984) *Crash (1986) *Romantic?

He made over 240 appearances as a forward in the Football League and Premier League for Crewe Alexandra, Norwich City and West Ham United, and was capped by England. He was highly praised as a talented centre forward, but had a career frustrated by injury. He retired on 11 December 2009, aged 26, after failing to recover from a long-term ankle injury sustained during international duty with England. ==Club career== ===Crewe Alexandra=== Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, and raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, Ashton spent his youth career playing at both Stoke City and Crewe Alexandra. He was a product of Crewe's renowned youth development policy under manager Dario Gradi. He signed scholarship forms as a 16-year-old in 2000 before making his first-team debut on 28 October as an 83rd-minute substitute in Crewe's 1‚Äì0 win at Gillingham and became one of the youngest players to represent the club. He waited three months for his second appearance, again as substitute, in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Grimsby Town, and his first goal for the Railwaymen was in their 4‚Äì2 victory against Burnley. His first start arrived in an FA Cup clash against Cardiff City in January 2001. He finished his first season at the club with eight goals, including crucial ones against Bolton Wanderers, Portsmouth, Gillingham and Wimbledon towards the end of the season as Crewe secured their First Division status. His second season at the club was disrupted by injury and a temporary loss of form, but in spite of this he scored ten times and began to win international honours with England at under-16, under-17, under-18 and under-19 level. Ashton scored 16 more times in the 2002‚Äì03 season as the club bounced back to the First Division after just one season in the Second Division. Ashton had a number of notable displays for Crewe, one of which was in the 4‚Äì0 win against Luton Town, where he scored two goals and set up David Vaughan's goal. Crewe manager Dario Gradi said that \\"These have been his best performances and people are right to say he has a bright future in the game.\\" In the 2003‚Äì04 season, he scored 19 league goals in the First Division, including his first Football League hat-trick in a 3‚Äì2 win at the JJB Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 6 March 2004 ‚Äì a match in which he converted two penalties. During the season, Ashton was reportedly linked to a number of clubs, Wolves were among the clubs interested in signing the striker at the time, however Dario Gradi regarded all the rumours as just speculation. Having previously played for England at Under-19 level, he stepped up to the under-21 team that season, scoring against the Netherlands and Sweden. Ashton scored 20 times for Crewe in the 2004‚Äì05 season prior to becoming Norwich City's record signing at ¬£3 million. === Norwich City === Ashton joined Norwich City from Crewe Alexandra for a fee of ¬£3 million in January 2005, breaking the club's transfer record previously held by the ¬£1 million deal that brought Jon Newsome to Norwich City from Leeds United in 1994, although this record was later broken by the ¬£3.5m transfer of Robert Earnshaw to Carrow Road from West Bromwich Albion. Additionally, Crewe inserted a 20% sell-on clause, meaning that the South Cheshire club would receive 20 percent of any profit if Norwich sold the striker to another club. He scored on his home debut for Norwich City against Middlesbrough in an exciting eight goal thriller, Norwich came back from 4‚Äì1 down to draw the match 4‚Äì4. In February, Ashton scored an impressive goal against Manchester City which later achieved second place in the BBC's Goal of the Month for February, Thierry Henry's goal against Crystal Palace won the award. Many of the pundits believed that Ashton would be the key to Norwich's survival. Ashton scored many important goals in Norwich's fight for survival, including the deciding goals against Newcastle and Birmingham. Norwich however, were relegated in 2005 and even with a host of Premier league clubs interested in him, Ashton decided to stay at the club in the next season in an attempt to win promotion back into the Premier League. Later that year Ashton scored his first and only hat trick for Norwich City against Southampton, in a 3‚Äì1 win at Carrow Road. With Norwich out of the top flight there was much speculation surrounding Ashton's future at the club, with some people believing a player with his qualities merited a place in the Premier League. Many clubs, including Manchester City and Charlton Athletic, considered him; the Addicks manager, Alan Curbishley, was reportedly prepared to axe six of his players to buy the Norwich youngster. West Ham United were also among the clubs interested in buying the striker. Nigel Worthington attempted to quash these rumours, saying that Ashton would only be sold for a price which matched his value to the club. Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell was put off considering a move for Ashton because of this price. Dean Ashton re-stated his commitment to the club in the summer of 2005 by signing a contract-extension until 2009. By December, it looked likely that a Premiership club would bid for Ashton, as boss Nigel Worthington said that Ashton would be allowed to leave in January of that year ‚Äì if the club are happy with the fee. Dean Ashton's future looked increasingly uncertain after missing the FA Cup match against West Ham through injury which meant Ashton was not cup-tied. After playing 46 matches for Norwich, in which he scored 18 goals, he was transferred to West Ham on 22 January 2006 for a fee of ¬£7 million, rising to ¬£7.25 million with two ¬£125,000 bonuses dependent on a future England call-up and possible European qualification while Ashton is at West Ham. Norwich also negotiated a 15% sell-on clause. ===West Ham United=== Ashton playing for West Ham United in 2007 Norwich accepted West Ham's bid after apparently having been in negotiations with them for a few weeks. On 22 January 2006, the day the transfer was announced, Ashton agreed personal terms with the club and underwent a medical later in the day. He was unveiled at a press conference prior to West Ham's match against Fulham on 23 January. Ashton said \\"The chance of a swift step up to the Premiership is too good to turn down. I'm really delighted to join a massive club like West Ham. When West Ham came along I jumped at the chance to be back and playing in the Premiership. My ambition has always been to be playing in the Premiership regularly and hopefully the club can make the best of my ability. I spoke to Norwich manager Nigel Worthington and the board and told them I wanted to pursue this opportunity. I'd like to thank Norwich for understanding that and allowing myself and my representative to talk to West Ham.\\" Ashton made an impressive start to his West Ham career, making his debut in the Hammers' 3‚Äì2 victory away to Arsenal, and scored some key goals in West Ham's following fixtures, including two goals in the FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester City, which was vital in continuing the team's inspiring FA Cup run in 2006. In West Ham's semi-final against Middlesbrough, Ashton broke Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer's cheekbone. He caught Schwarzer with his elbow in an aerial challenge in the first half. This incident did not go well with the Middlesbrough fans, who booed Ashton for the remaining time he was on the field. Ashton however, made an apology to Schwarzer and to 'Boro fans and said that it was accidental and that no malice was intended. Ashton with West Ham United in 2008 To cap off a pivotal season in Ashton's career, he scored a goal and was a thorn in the usually solid Liverpool defence in the 2006 FA Cup Final, which eventually ended (after a 3‚Äì3 draw) in a 3‚Äì1 penalty shootout victory for the Merseysiders. Ashton had been a doubt in the build-up to the match after picking up a hamstring injury in the Premier League match versus West Bromwich Albion. However, despite not participating in any intensive training before the final, Ashton declared himself fit, and duly produced one of the most impressive displays in his short time at West Ham. Despite not managing to secure a place in Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson's England squad for the 2006 World Cup, Ashton impressed sufficiently to draw praise from football pundit Alan Hansen. and then West Ham manager, Alan Pardew. He scored 6 goals in 16 appearances in his first half-season with the club. During the summer of 2006, Ashton was linked with moves away from Upton Park, one club that was mentioned the most was Newcastle United. However, Alan Pardew claimed Ashton would be \\"going nowhere\\". Ashton suffered a broken ankle while on England duty in August 2006, which meant that he was forced eventually to miss the whole of the 2006‚Äì07 season. In his absence, West Ham were fighting relegation for virtually the whole season, which led to speculation that Ashton would leave if the club was relegated. Eggert Magn√∫sson, the club's chairman, stated in March 2007 that Ashton would not be allowed to leave until the following January at the earliest if the club were to go down. \\"West Ham chairman Eggert Magnusson said: \\"Dean is here to stay as I see it. He hasn't played all season and he has to be involved in matches before he can interest other clubs. First he has to reach the level he was at before he was injured. That means Ashton would have to remain at Upton Park until the transfer window reopened on 1 January.\\" In the event, the club avoided relegation on the final day of the 2006‚Äì07 season. Ashton returned to the West Ham team on 14 July 2007 in a pre- season friendly against Dagenham & Redbridge where he played for 45 minutes. He admitted he had doubted whether he would ever return to top class football and was excitedly looking forward to next season, saying, \\"I don't think there will be a hungrier player in the Premier League this season than me\\". He scored his first goals for a year in the pre-season matches against Leyton Orient and Roma. He made his return to the Premier League on 11 August 2007 against Manchester City, coming on as a substitute for George McCartney in the 65th minute, and went on to make 35 league and cup appearances in the 2007‚Äì08 season, scoring 11 goals, most notably an overhead kick against Manchester United. Ashton signed a new five-year contract at West Ham in June 2008, keeping him at the club until 2013. Ashton started the 2008‚Äì09 Premiership campaign in blistering form, scoring both goals in the 2‚Äì1 home win against Wigan. However, he quickly found himself back on the Hammers' burgeoning injury list after spraining his ankle in manager Gianfranco Zola's first training session. Ashton made no appearances in the 2009‚Äì10 season. On 11 December 2009, West Ham announced that Ashton had retired, aged 26, after failing to recover from a long-term ankle injury originally sustained during an international training session, in August 2006, following a tackle from Shaun Wright-Phillips. Ashton made 56 appearances in all competitions for West Ham, scoring 19 goals, but at his retirement had not played since appearing against West Bromwich Albion on 13 September 2008.Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Dean Ashton Upon hearing the announcement of the striker's retirement, Ashton's former manager at Crewe, Dario Gradi, told the press that he wanted Ashton in time to become part of the coaching team at Crewe. In January 2011, West Ham, seeking compensation for Ashton, prepared a writ against The Football Association for ¬£10.5m. In 2013, Ashton started his own claim for work injury compensation for loss of future earnings following his 2006 injury while playing for England. ==International career== Ashton progressed through the England youth set up, racking up an impressive goal-to-game ratio. In August 2006, Ashton was first called up to the England senior team for their friendly against Greece, part of new manager Steve McClaren's team. However, just a day before the match, the striker suffered a heavy tackle from Shaun Wright-Phillips which resulted in a broken ankle in training and missed out on a chance to make his England debut against Greece. He then later was ruled out for more than a year and missed the whole of the West Ham season. He was recalled to the England squad and was fit to face Estonia. However, a few days later, it was announced that he had been ruled out of action for up to six weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament, forcing him to once again miss out on making his international debut for a second time. In May 2008, Ashton was named in McClaren's successor, Fabio Capello's, squad for the USA and Trinidad and Tobago friendlies.

An Assessment of Volcanic Threat and Monitoring Capabilities in the United States: Framework for a National Volcano Early Warning System. United States Geological Survey, April 2005. the threat from future eruptions is considered to be high; much of this threat comes from the possibility of disruption of nearby air routes by large releases of ash. The mountain currently has basic real-time monitoring, but the USGS would like to improve instrumentation at the site. The mountain shares a name with the nearby Pavlof Sister, which last erupted in 1786. == Volcanic activity == After its eruption in 1996, the volcano entered a period of dormancy, the longest it had been dormant since records of its eruptions have been kept. This period ended on August 15, 2007, with the start of a new eruption involving seismic disturbances and a \\"vigorous eruption of lava.\\" Scientists said that the volcano \\"could be working toward a massive eruption that could affect air travel but was not expected to threaten any of the towns in the area.\\" The eruption ended on September 13. The volcano erupted again on May 13, 2013, but activity had greatly diminished by July 3, 2013, and on August 8, 2013, the Current Volcano Alert Level was reduced to NORMAL and the Current Aviation Color Code reduced to GREEN. A low-level eruption began on May 31, 2014. On June 2 seismic activity intensified and officials raised the alert level from \\"Watch\\" to \\"Warning\\" and the aviation color code from \\"Orange\\" to \\"Red\\" after pilots in the area reported an ash plume that reached as high as 22,000 feet above sea level. A new eruption began on March 27, 2016, sending an ash cloud to 37,000 feet above sea level, extending 400 miles NE. The volcano gave 25 minutes warning before the onset of the eruption. The alert level was raised to \\"Warning\\" and the aviation color code was raised to \\"Red\\", which indicates incoming eruption with high levels of ash. The nearby village of Nelson Lagoon was coated with tephra during the powerful eruption. The volcano stopped emitting ash clouds on March 31, 2016. This volcano erupted again on October 29, 2019. == Climbing history == The first recorded ascent of Pavlof Volcano was on June 27, 1928, by T. A. Jagger, J. Gardiner, O. P. McKinley, P. A. Yatchmenoff and R. H. Stewart, although \\"speculation surrounds this ascent, which was recounted in National Geographic.\\"Michael Wood and Colby Coombs, Alaska: a climbing guide, The Mountaineers, 2001, p. 46. The straightforward nature of the climb suggests that an earlier unrecorded ascent may have occurred. The second ascent was in June 1950 by T. P. Bank. The main challenge of climbing this peak is its remoteness and the consequent difficulty of access. The peak is a journey from the north side of Cold Bay. The climb itself is a straightforward snow climb, and the ski descent is recommended.

Guest (born 1957) was a U.S. Ambassador to Romania during the Bush Presidency. Guest was sworn in by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on September 18, 2001 and took up his duties on September 24, 2001. His partner Alex Nevarez was acknowledged by Powell at the swearing-in ceremony in the State Department Diplomatic Reception Room. LGBT rights groups viewed Guest's appointment, and Powell's remarks, as historic and indicative of greater recognition of gay State Department employees and same-sex couples. Socially conservative groups expressed opposition to Guest's appointment and to Powell's gesture. ==Ambassador== A Foreign Service officer since 1981, Guest was the first publicly gay man to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate and serve as a U.S. Ambassador. The first publicly gay ambassador, James Hormel, received a recess appointment from Bill Clinton after the Senate failed to confirm his nomination. Guest resided together with Nevarez at the residence of the American Embassy in Bucharest until 2004 when his appointment came to an end. Romania's last anti-gay law, Article 200 of the Penal Code, which criminalised public manifestations of homosexuality, was repealed shortly before Guest's arrival as ambassador in 2001. During his tenure as ambassador, Guest was outspoken against public corruption, which he said had impeded Romania's development since the fall of communism. At the same time, his ambassadorship was characterized by strong relations between the U.S. and Romania. Romania committed troops to support U.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Romania was also admitted into NATO and intensified negotiations that would eventually lead to the country's accession into the European Union. President George W. Bush made an official visit to Bucharest in 2002. Before Guest's departure from Romania at the end of his duties in 2003, then Romanian President Ion Iliescu awarded him the Romanian \\"Order for Faithful Service in the Rank of Grand Cross\\" in appreciation for his \\"high professionalism, dedication to his mission ... and for his personal contribution to the strengthening of the Romanian-American partnership.\\" In April 2003, the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce recognized him with a Leadership Award, which honors individuals who have made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender people. In 2004, the Department of State awarded him the Charles E. Cobb, Jr. award for Initiative and Success in Trade Development due to his leadership in increasing trade between the U.S. and Romania. In June 2006, the American Foreign Service Association awarded him the Christian Herter Award for Constructive Dissent, for his advocacy on behalf of equality for State Department gay and lesbian employees. ==Retirement== Guest retired from the State Department, where he last served as a dean at the Department's Foreign Service Institute. At his retirement ceremony on November 20, 2007, in the Treaty Room, Guest publicly criticized Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the issue of discrimination against gay employees and specifically the benefits denied to same-sex partners of department employees. He remarked, \\"I've felt compelled to choose between obligations to my partner ‚Äì who is my family ‚Äì and service to my country. That anyone should have to make that choice is a stain on the Secretary's leadership and a shame for this institution and our country.\\" On December 5, 2008, the Associated Press reported that Guest had been selected as a member of President-elect Barack Obama's transition team at the State Department. Also in 2008, Guest co-founded the Council for Global Equity (a coalition of human rights and LGBT advocacy organizations seeking U.S. support for LGBT- fair policies abroad), for which he is a senior adviser. Guest was a co-author of the Dallas Principles, drafted in May 2009. In early 2016, at a Council for Global Equity reception in Washington, D.C., Guest spoke against the anti- immigrant \\"hateful rhetoric\\" that Republican candidates had been using on the campaign trail. ==See also== *Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies (GLIFAA) *United States Foreign Service *List of LGBT Ambassadors of the United States ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Romania Category:Gay diplomats Category:LGBT ambassadors of the United States Category:United States Foreign Service personnel ","title":"Michael E.

E. Igariwey in African Anarchism: The History of a Movement make the claim that: The reason why traditional African societies are characterised as possessing \\"anarchic elements\\" is because of their relatively horizontal political structure and, in some cases, the absence of classes. In addition to that, the leadership of elders normally did not extend into the kinds of authoritative structures which characterise the modern state. A strong value was, however, placed on traditional and \\"natural\\" values. For example, although there were no laws against rape, homicide, and adultery, a person committing those acts would be persecuted together with his or her kin. The principle of collective responsibility was sometimes upheld. Class systems had already existed in some African civilisations (such as Nubia, Egypt, Axum and the Hausa Kingdoms) for millennia, but processes of social stratification accelerated from the fifteenth century onwards. ==Modern anarchist movements== === Algeria === After the 2001 Black Spring in Kabylie, anarchist organisers have been able to create a moderately sized anarchist community in the town of Barbacha. ===Egypt=== The anarchist movement first emerged in Egypt in the late nineteenth century, but collapsed in the 1940s. The movement has reemerged in the early 2010s. The movement re-entered global view when a number of anarchist groups took part in the 2011 Egyptian revolution, namely the Egyptian Libertarian Socialist Movement and Black Flag. The Egyptian anarchists have come under attack from the military regime and the Muslim Brotherhood.FEATURES: Anarchists: Preferably Stateless Archived in 2013. On October 7, 2011, the Egyptian Libertarian Socialist Movement held their first conference in Cairo.Anarchist: First Conference of Egypt's Libertarian Socialists (2011) ===Nigeria=== The Nigerian anarchist movement emerged in the early 1990s, with the establishment of the anarcho-syndicalist Awareness League. ===South Africa=== Anarchism dates back to the 1880s in South Africa, when the English anarchist immigrant Henry Glasse settled in Port Elizabeth in the then Cape Colony. Anarchists played a role in the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), established in Cape Town in 1904 and open to socialists of all persuasions. The first specifically anarchist organisations was the revolutionary syndicalist International Socialist League (ISL), founded in Johannesburg in 1915. It went on to establish branches across much of South Africa, excluding the western Cape where the anarchists split from the SDF to form the Industrial Socialist League (IndSL). By mutual agreement, the IndSL operated in the western Cape, while the ISL operated in the rest of the country. The IndSL and the ISL would go on to organise the first trade union among workers of colour in South Africa, the Industrial Workers of Africa (IWA), modelled on the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Swept up in the atmosphere created by what at the time appeared to be a victorious worker revolution in Russia in 1917, the ISL and the IndSL dissolved into the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) at the latter's founding in 1921, providing many notable early figures until the Comintern ordered the expulsion of the syndicalist faction in the party. Unaligned syndicalists like Percy Fisher were active in the miners' 1922 Rand Rebellion, a general strike- turned-insurrection, and strongly opposed the racism of a large sector of the white strikers. The IWA meanwhile merged into the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union (ICU) in 1920, one reason the ICU exhibited syndicalist influence. The anarchist movement in South Africa only re-emerged in the early 1990s with the establishment of small anarchist collectives in Durban and Johannesburg. The Anarchist Revolutionary Movement (ARM) was founded in 1993. It was succeeded by the more tightly organised Workers' Solidarity Federation (WSF) in 1995. As opposed to the looser ARM, the WSF was in the tradition of platformism. In 1999, for a range of reasons, the WSF dissolved. It was succeeded by the Bikisha Media Collective (BMC) and Zabalaza Books. These two books co-produced Zabalaza: A Journal of Southern African Revolutionary Anarchism and were active in the Anti-Privatisation Forum. In 2003, the platformist Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Federation (ZACF, or ZabFed) was founded, drawing in the BMC and Zabalaza Books (whose Zabalaza journal became the journal of the ZACF) as well as a number of other collectives that had been set up in Soweto and Johannesburg, including a local chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross. In 2007, in order to strengthen its structures, ZabFed reconstituted itself as the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front (ZACF, or ZabFront). The new ZACF is a unitary \\"federation of individuals\\", as opposed to a federation of collectives like ZabFed, and has recently also come under the influence of especifismo, a tendency which originated within the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Uruguaya (FAU, or Uruguayan Anarchist Federation). While committed to promoting syndicalism in the unions, ZACF work was in practice largely focused on the so-called \\"new social movements\\", formed in South Africa in response to the perceived failures of the African National Congress (ANC) government post-apartheid. The ZACF was involved in the campaigns of the Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF) and the Landless People's Movement (LPM). It has also been involved in solidarity work with Abahlali baseMjondolo and the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign. In addition to such work, the ZACF is active in organising workshops and propaganda. ==Anarchist organisations in Africa== * International Socialist League (South Africa), 1915-1921 * Industrial Workers of Africa (South Africa), 1917-1920 * Industrial Socialist League (South Africa), 1918-1921 * Awareness League (Nigeria), 1990s-Present * Anarchist Revolutionary Movement (South Africa), 1993-1995 * Workers' Solidarity Federation (Southern Africa), 1995-1999 * Bikisha Media Collective (South Africa), 1999-2007 * Zabalaza Books (South Africa), 1999-2007 * South African chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross, 2002-2007 * Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Federation (Southern Africa), 2003-2007 * Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front (Southern Africa), 2007-Present * Black Flag (Egypt), 2010s-Present * Libertarian Socialist Movement (Egypt), 2011-Present ==See also== * Black anarchism * Politics of Africa == References == ==Further reading== * \\"Anarchism and Revolutionary Syndicalism in South Africa, 1904-1921\\" by Lucien van der Walt * \\"Military Dictatorship and the State in Africa\\" by Sam Mbah and I.

The town situated in a rural farming district, and is the third oldest town in present-day Free State, (after Philippolis and Winburg). ==History== ===Land disputes=== From the 1830s onwards, numbers of white settlers from the Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and started arriving in the fertile southern part of territory known as the Lower Caledon Valley, in which the commonage of Smithfield would later be established. The Lower Caledon Valley, named after the Caledon River that runs through it, was at that time occupied by herders and their cattle under the authority of the Basotho king Moshoeshoe. In 1845, a treaty was signed between Moshoeshoe and the British colonial authorities headed by the Cape Colony governor Sir Harry Smith. The treaty recognised white occupation in the area, though no boundaries were stipulated. In early South Africa, European notions of boundaries and private land ownership had no counterparts in African political culture. To the local African chieftains, customary tribute in the form of horses and cattle represented acceptance by the reigning chief of land use under his authority. To both the Boer and the British settlers, the same form of tribute was believed to constitute purchase and permanent ownership of the land under independent authority. King Moshoeshoe with his advisorsAccording to historical accounts, Moshoeshoe was under the impression he was authorising temporary grazing land to the settlers, while the settlers believed they had been given permanent land rights. Conflicts ensued. The British, who at that time had taken control of the area between the Orange and Vaal Rivers, which they named the Orange River Sovereignty, decided a discernible boundary was necessary and proclaimed a line known as the Warden Line, which divided the area between British and Basotho territories. Smithfield was placed within the British territory and became the colonial administrative centre of what was named the Caledon District. The Mohokare river, meaning \\"in the midst\\" (of Basotho territory), which ran close to Smithfield, was renamed the Caledon river, after the Earl of Caledon, British governor of the Cape Colony from 1807 to 1811. Although land in the district belonged officially to the British Crown, the British civil commissioner of Smithfield, Charles Halse, made a personal fortune speculating in private land deals. In 1854, the British handed over the territory to the Boer republic of Orange Free State, formalised with the signing of the Orange River Convention.About Lesotho . Accessed 1 May 2015 A succession of wars followed from 1858 to 1868 between the Basotho kingdom and the Boer republic of Orange Free State. Both sides adopted scorched-earth tactics. In particular, the Basotho destroyed farmhouses and burned large swathes of pasturage and cropland in the area between Smithfield and Reddersburg. The Boer commandos, for their part, attacked and destroyed the French Evangelical Mission station at Beersheba, near Smithfield, which the Boers considered to be sympathetic towards the Basotho. ===Establishment=== Waterval farm was the original site chosen in 1848 for settlement as a Dutch Reformed (NG) church centre. However, when plots were offered for sale, there were no takers. Farmers were dissatisfied with the site (24 km west of present-day Smithfield). They then opted for Rietpoort, where there was abundant water. The new town was named New Smithfield (the \\"New\\" soon fell away), apparently named after Sir Harry Smith, former governor of the Cape Colony. In the fifty years after the town was established, the Dutch Reformed Church remained a central point of the town. one of the dominees who served there was Rev Andrew Murray.The Second Boer War General Christiaan de Wet was born on the nearby farm Leeukop in 1854. Smithfield had a village board in 1860 but only became a municipality in 1948. In the 1870s the town was on one of the main routes to the Diamond Fields from the coast via Aliwal North, and trade was brisk in that period. In the period 1907 to 1939, the MP for Smithfield was General Hertzog who represented the constituency for the Oranje Unie, the South African Party, the National Party and the United Party. He was the leader of the National Party from 1914 to 1939 and Prime Minister of SA from 1924 to 1929. On 19 August 1963, Prime Minister HF Verwoerd addressed a conference in Smithfield, where he announced plans to withdraw from the British Commonwealth and to unilaterally declare a Republic. He added that \\"South Africa is destined to be the country that will provide Whites all over the world with a new source of inspiration.\\" His announcement from Smithfield made international news headlines. Rand Daily Mail, 20 August 1963 ==Geographic setting== The town is tucked into a horseshoe of hills, some 132 km southeast of Bloemfontein along the N6 national road to East London, Eastern Cape. The Caledon River bounds Smithfield on the east and south. The district is drained by various tributaries of this river, the Vinkel and Wilgeboom Spruits being the largest. As the town lies 13 km west of the river, water has to be obtained from boreholes around the town dam. ==Demographics and economy== Smithfield is part of the impoverished Xhariep district. The Weekly, (Bloemfontein), \\"Magashule rebukes Mohokare over debt\\", November 18, 2011 It has a population of approximately 4,000 black people, and a white population of about 500. The generally run-down condition of the town is contrasted by the comparative prosperity of the surrounding wool-growing and cattle farming district. ==Administration== Smithfield is one of three towns within the municipal jurisdiction of Mohokare Local Municipality. As a result of a municipal debt crisis, the municipality is unable to provide satisfactory basic services to its residents. These include sanitation, water, town planning and road repairs.The Weekly, (Bloemfontein), November 18, 2011 ==Accommodation== The town's position astride major tourist routes has lent some impetus to tourism. Smithfield hosts nine guest-houses and bed and breakfast establishments.Accommodation in Smithfield ==Places of interest== The Caledon River museum is located in the town. The Carmel and Beersheba missionary posts are situated nearby. The well-maintained local golf course dates back more than 100 years. Its facilities are open to guests, as are local tennis court and bowls club. Hills surrounding the town are considered well-suited to hiking, horse-riding and bird-watching in relative isolation. Local secondary roads and mountain trails are suitable for mountain biking. Blesbok and some Zebra are to be found in the open savanna Game farms such as Letatsi is also found 25km outside of Smithfiled, which enhances the experiences of seeing wildlife up close in game drives and also being able to do hunting in the hunting season which is normally between June-August. ==Archaeology== The Wilton/Smithfield fossil classification system takes its name in part from the town. Scientist George Stow excavated a cave near Smithfield in 1877 and found tools from the Late Stone Age which he described in his book, Native races of South Africa.

Test scripts written as a short program can either be written using a special automated functional GUI test tool (such as HP QuickTest Professional, Borland SilkTest, IBM TPNS and Rational Robot) or in a well-known programming language (such as C++, C#, Tcl, Expect, Java, PHP, Perl, Powershell, Python, or Ruby).

These last two types are also done in manual testing. Automated testing is advantageous for a number of reasons: tests may be executed continuously without the need for human intervention, they are easily repeatable, and often faster. Automated tests are useful in situations where the test is to be executed several times, for example as part of regression testing. Automated tests can be disadvantageous when poorly written, leading to incorrect testing or broken tests being carried out. Disadvantages of automated testing are that automated tests can ‚Äî like any piece of software ‚Äî be poorly written or simply break during playback. They also can only examine what they have been programmed to examine. Since most systems are designed with human interaction in mind, it is good practice that a human tests the system at some point. A trained manual tester can notice that the system under test is misbehaving without being prompted or directed; automated tests can only examine what they have been programmed to examine. When used in regression testing, manual testers can find new bugs while ensuring that old bugs do not reappear while an automated test can only ensure the latter. Mixed testing, with automated and manual testing, is often used; automating what needs to be tested often and can be easily checked by a machine, and using manual testing to do test design and exploratory testing. One should consider the return on investment for automating any given test script, i.e. does the cost to build and maintain that script cost less than it would take to simply execute it manually. Where cost can be measured in terms of time and/or money but also the opportunity cost of not freeing up people to do other work. ==See also== *Software testing *Unit test *Test plan *Test suite *Scenario testing *Session-based testing == References == Category:Software testing ","title":"Test script"},{"id":"1433336","text":"The prairie shrew (Sorex haydeni) is a small shrew found in the Canadian prairies and midwestern United States.

She was born Elizabeth (Betty) Thoms Carswell on 22 June 1918 in Wallsend, Tyneside, of Scottish parents who moved to Glasgow. She had a daughter, Frances, by Jack Clark, a businessman. Her sister Joan provided the first half of her pen-name. ==Being a Scot== Joan chose the pen- name Ure, because it sounded more Scottish to her. Having been born in England made her self-consciously Scots, and she adopted an ironic refrain throughout her public writing: \\"Scottish, more or less\\" and \\"as Scots as I am\\". In correspondence she wrote \\"I could say I am an Englishman, and spite 'em all.\\" ==Work== Joan Ure wrote short stories and poems as well as short plays, but she made her mark with her work for the theatre. She never wrote a full-length play. Among her work to achieve a professional production, I See Myself as This Young Girl, an exploration of a mother-daughter relationship, was directed by Michael Meacham at the close theatre Club, Glasgow, in 1967. It demonstrated her lyrical gifts. She wrote her first play, Cendrillon, in French, for the 4th year school class to perform. Death by suicide was one of her themes, summed up in the poem, In Memoriam 1971, published in Scottish International. Her poem Signal at Red, written 1964, is addressed to her correspondent, John Cairns, and alludes to Ian Hamilton Finlay, with whom she had put on plays at the Falcon Theatre in 1962, hers being Punctuated Rhythms. He is also the disappointing lover referred to in her short story, Midsummer's Eve, published in Words 6 in 1978. She claims he was almost the death of her, though she doesn't specify how & there's nothing in the correspondence, 1963‚Äì1971, to suggest she ever proposed leaving her husband for him. Another poem, \\"In Memoriam\\" 1971, deals with another of her themes, death, by suicide, primarily incited by that of her sister, Joan's. One of her best plays is the revue Nothing May Come of It which incorporates song and dance. She characterises people she knew including her correspondent as the lead actress in Nothing May Come of It as well as Puck in Seven Characters out of the Dream. Her correspondence with John Cairns provides a framework for understanding her life and work and is shortly to be published by Ki Publishing as CORRESPONDENCE. ==Scottish Society of Playwrights== Joan Ure, Ena Lamont Stewart, and Ada F Kay were among the founder members of the Scottish Society of Playwrights, which was set up after a meeting called in September 1973 by Hector MacMillan, Ena Lamont Stewart and John Hall. ==Acclaim in Scotland== A poem by Joan Ure was suggested by members of the public as one of the runners-up for the Scottish Parliament's Canongate Wall Project to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Holyrood Parliament: A country makes the artists it deserves / As it makes governments / Our artists shriek in paranoiac discords / When they are not just havering / You hope they do not feel they speak for you. *The Canongate Wall ==Acclaim abroad== The University of Bologna, Italy, teaches several English Literature modules, using Joan Ure's plays Qualcosa anche per Cordelia (Something in it for Cordelia), and Sette Personaggi Venuti dal sogno (Seven Characters out of a dream). *Dream English *Cordelia English *Cordelia English *Characters English The University of Parma, Italy, also uses two plays by Joan Ure in their English Literature programme: Come una ragazzina (1968) and Riprendi la tua costola !

Since January 19, 2010, it has been the administrative center of the North Caucasian Federal District of Russia. Population: ==Overview== The name is derived from the fused Russian words \\"\\" (five mountains) and the city is so called because of the five peaks of the Beshtau (which also means five mountains in Turkic) of the Caucasian mountain range overlooking the city. It was founded in 1780, and has been a health spa with mineral springs since 1803. Pyatigorsk is one of the oldest spa resorts in Russia. The health resort provides unique medical resources, and its underground wealth supplies 50 different mineral springs, medical mud taken from Lake Tambukan located from Pyatigorsk, and the mild climate of the area. It is one of 116 historical towns of the Russian Federation. Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov was shot in a duel at Pyatigorsk on July 27, 1841. There is a museum in the city devoted to his memory. The Zionist activist Joseph Trumpeldor was born in Pyatigorsk. ==History== View of Pyatigorsk between 1890 and 1900. The writings of the 14th-century Arabian traveler Ibn Battuta included the earliest known mention of the mineral springs. Peter the Great (reigned 1682-1725) fostered the earliest scientific study of them, but the information collected on his expedition has not survived. Interest revived at the end of the 18th century with the foundation of the first Russian settlement (Konstantinogorskaya fortress), erected at Mt. Mashuk in 1780. The value of the Caucasian mineral waters led to the construction of a resort in 1803, and studies of their medical properties began thereafter: on April 24, Alexander I signed a decree which made the mineral waters state property. Many settlements developed near the springs: first Goryachevodsk (now part of Pyatigorsk) at the bottom of Mt. Mashuk, then Kislovodsk, Yessentuki, and Zheleznovodsk. During World War II the German Wehrmacht temporarily occupied Pyatigorsk. The Einsatzkommando 12 of Einsatzgruppe D had its headquarters in Pyatigorsk in 1942. Jonathan Littell: Die Wohlgesinnten - Materialienband. Berlin 2006. P. 66 The German occupation resulted in the killing of many Jewish inhabitants of the region. ==Geography and climate== The city is situated on a small plateau, above sea level, at the foot of Beshtau, Mashuk, and three other outliers of the Caucasus Mountains, which protect it on the north. The snow-covered summits of Mount Elbrus are visible to the south. The climate of Pyatigorsk falls within humid continental (Dfb) classification under the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system and is characterized by absence of sharp fluctuations of annual and daily temperatures. Summers are warm with the average July temperature of while winters, lasting two to three months, are cold, with the average January temperature of . Spring is cool, with a sharp transition by the summer, and a warm, dry, and long fall. There are an average of ninety-eight sunny days in a year. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with two urban-type settlements (Goryachevodsky and Svobody) and five rural localities, incorporated as the city of krai significance of Pyatigorsk‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Resolution #63-p As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Pyatigorsk is incorporated as Pyatigorsk Urban Okrug.Law #88-kz ==Economy== The industry of Pyatigorsk is primarily oriented towards service of the health resort. There is also food industry (a meat- processing plant, a winery, a dairy, a brewery, a confectionery), textiles (clothing, shoe plant, carpet factories), machine industry and metal working (P–û Pyatigorskselmash specializes in machines and equipment for aviculture; a special automobile equipment works, an electromechanical plant, etc.); mining, a chemical factory and a ceramics factory who specialize in porcelain and ceramic gifts such as samovars, figurines, vases, and decorative ceramic wall hanging panels. In 1991, the Pyatigorsk health resort had ten sanatoria, four boarding houses and five sanatoria-preventoria. The number of people who stayed at the health resort within a year totalled about 170,000. ==Points of interest== Lermontov's duel The state memorial estate of Mikhail Lermontov was founded in 1973. It unites all of the Lermontov memorial places in the region: the place where he fought his duel and was killed, a necropolis, Lermontov's small house, Verzilin's houses, the house of Alexander Alyabyev, the Lermontov square, and monument. The Aeolian harp is a small stone pavilion in the classical style, constructed by the brothers Bernardacci in 1828. Diana's grotto was built in 1830, in honor of the first ascent of Mount Elbrus. Pyatigorsk is very well known in the Caucasus region for its excellent restaurants and nightlife, architecture, as well as for its extremely large marketplace. A major thoroughfare is known to locals as \\"Broadway\\", which runs through the center of the city, and on which most of the best restaurants, nightclubs, and attractions are located. Broadway is also a popular spot for people watching. The influence of the Caucasus region is felt here most noticeably in the music and cuisine, which incorporate aspects of many former Soviet republics such as Armenia. Pyatigorsk features prominently in Jonathan Littell's 2009 novel, The Kindly Ones. ==Honors== Asteroid 2192 Pyatigoriya discovered in 1972 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Smirnova is named after the city. ==Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities== Pyatigorsk is twinned with: * Dilijan, Armenia * Dubuque, United States * H√©v√≠z, Hungary * Kochi, India * Panagyurishte, Bulgaria * Schwerte, Germany * Trikala, Greece ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== *Official website of Pyatigorsk *Website about Pyatigorsk *Weather in Pyatigorsk *Pyatigorsk city website *BBC News.

The nomenclature varies regionally: they are generally known as trigonometrical or triangulation stations in North America, trig points in the United Kingdom, trig pillars in Ireland, trig stations or points in Australia and New Zealand, and trig beacons in South Africa; triangulation pillar is the more formal term for the concrete columns found in the UK, however, the informal term, \\"trig point\\", is used more often. ==Use== The station is usually set up by a government with known coordinates and elevation published. Many stations are located on hilltops for the purposes of visibility. A graven metal plate on the top of a pillar may provide a mounting point for a theodolite or reflector. Trigonometrical stations are grouped together to form a network of triangulation. Positions of all land boundaries, roads, railways, bridges and other infrastructure can be accurately located by the network, a task that is essential to the construction of modern infrastructure. Apart from the known stations set up by government, some temporary trigonometrical stations are set up near construction sites for monitoring the precision and progress of construction. Some trigonometrical stations use the Global Positioning System for convenience; however, the accuracy depends on factors such as ionospheric and tropospheric propagation delay errors. Although stations are no longer required for many surveying purposes, they remain useful to hikers as navigational aids. Trig points or Triangulation Pillars are another way of spotting the top of a mountain on a map. The symbol for a trig point is a small triangle. They are real concrete pillars that are placed at particular places which are usually the tops of hills or mountains. ==Stations worldwide== ===Australia=== A geodetic survey marker in Wellington, New Zealand A national geodetic survey and adjustment carried out in the early 1970s in Australia has left a legacy of trig stations, many consisting of a ground mark with a black quadripod supporting a white square disc above the ground mark. [clarification needed] ===Hong Kong=== Many trigonometrical stations were placed on hilltops around Hong Kong. They strongly resemble those used in other British colonial territories such as Australia, consisting of a white column topped with a black band. ===Japan=== Class 3 triangulation point in Shiroyama Park in Inagi, Tokyo In Japan, there are five classes of : ; :They are installed approximately every , with smaller ones (as necessary) about every . There are about 1000 throughout Japan. The pillars are on a side, and each pillar is anchored with two very large perpendicular rocks buried underground. ; :They are installed approximately every .

The pillars are on a side, and each pillar is anchored with a large perpendicular rock buried underground. ; :They are installed approximately every , and there are about 69,000 throughout Japan. The pillars are on a side, and each pillar is anchored with a large perpendicular rock buried underground. ; :These markers were installed in 1899 and are the predecessors to the modern triangulation stations used in Japan today. They are generally not used anymore since the installation of the Class 1-4 stations. Some of them still exist at various locations throughout Japan. ===South Africa=== Lion's Head in Cape Town South Africa has a network of approximately 28,000 trig beacons, established by the Chief Directorate: National Geo-spatial Information (historically known as the Trigonometrical Survey). These beacons are typically white-painted concrete pillars supporting black metal plates in a cross shape, installed on mountains, hills or tall buildings. ===Spain=== A triangulation pillar in Torre del Miguelete. Valencia (Spain) In Spain there are 11,000 triangulation stations, concrete buildings which typically consist of a cylinder 120 cm high and 30 cm diameter over a concrete cubic base. They were erected by the Instituto Geogr√°fico Nacional, usually painted in white, and can be marked with a metallic label with the warning: \\"The destruction of this sign is punishable by law.\\" ===United Kingdom=== A trig point near Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire, England In the United Kingdom, trig points are typically concrete pillars and were erected by the Ordnance Survey. The process of placing trig points on top of prominent hills and mountains began in 1935 to assist in the accurate retriangulation of Great Britain. The Ordnance Survey's first trig point was erected on 18 April 1936 near Cold Ashby, Northamptonshire. In low-lying or flat areas some trig points are only a few metres above sea level and one is even at ‚àí1 m (near Little Ouse, Cambridgeshire, TL61718 89787).\\"Happy 80th birthday to the trig pillar\\" Ordnance Survey When all the trig points were in place, it was possible in clear weather to see at least two other trig points from any one trig point, but subsequent vegetation growth means that this is not necessarily still the case. Careful measurements of the angles between the lines-of-sight of the other trig points then allowed the construction of a system of triangles which could then be referenced back to a single baseline to construct a highly accurate measurement system that covered the entire country. Mam Tor Derbyshire England In most of the UK, trig points are truncated square concrete (occasionally stone) pyramids or obelisks tapering towards the top. On the top a brass plate with three arms and a central depression is fixed: it is used to mount and centre a theodolite used to take angular measurements to neighbouring trig points. A benchmark is usually set on the side, marked with the letters \\"O S B M\\" (Ordnance Survey Bench Mark) and the reference number of the trig point. Within and below the visible trig point, there are concealed reference marks whose National Grid References are precisely known. The standard trig point design is credited to Brigadier Martin Hotine (1898‚Äì1968), head of the Trigonometrical and Levelling Division of the Ordnance Survey. Many of them are now disappearing from the countryside as their function has largely been superseded by aerial photography and digital mapping using lasers and GPS.

Hill is known for his flamboyant stage clothes and hairstyle. ==Early life== Born in Flete House, Holbeton, Devon, the son of a mechanic, he moved with his parents to Penn, Wolverhampton when he was a year old. There he attended Springdale Junior school and Highfields Secondary school. He bought his first guitar from a mail order catalogue and received some guitar lessons from a science teacher at his school. He then formed a band called The Young Ones with some school friends. He worked in an office for Tarmac Limited for over two years after leaving school. ==Slade== Hill in his Slade stage clothes in 1973 Hill originally played with drummer Don Powell in a band called The Vendors, whose name was then changed to The N' Betweens. The pair then met bass player Jimmy Lea and singer Noddy Holder, whereafter Slade was born. Though Hill is left-handed, he played and still plays guitar right-handed. Hill's best known guitar was the \\"John Birch Superyob\\" that was built in 1973. The guitar was used by Madness guitarist Chris Foreman in the video for Madness' song \\"Shut Up\\" and is now owned by Marco Pirroni of Adam and the Ants. Hill is known for his outrageous costumes. The music journalist Stuart Maconie commented: His costumes and antics caused some friction with the more serious Lea. This led to a show-down in a BBC dressing room before a recording of Top of the Pops, where Hill replied to the band's criticism of his dress by saying \\"You write 'em Jim, I'll sell em!\\" Although he was famous for his hairstyle, in 1977 he shaved his entire head completely bald and kept it that way before growing his trademark hairstyle back a few years later. During 1983, both Hill and Powell were working on a Dave Hill solo project with local musicians around the Midlands area. By 1984, the project had not been completed. The then-editor of the Slade fan club, Haden Donovan, described the project as \\"very interesting and very un-Slade-like.\\" In 1989, Hill formed his own group, Blessings in Disguise. This featured Holder, ex-Wizzard keyboard player, Bill Hunt, Craig Fenney and Bob Lamb.7\\" vinyl single of Crying in the Rain sleeve notes. The debut single, released in 1989 for the Christmas market was a ballad cover of The Everly Brothers' Crying in the Rain with Holder drafted in for lead vocals, backed by a Hill/Hunt composition, Wild Nights. The record was a commercial failure. The band also recorded a cover of the Elvis Presley song \\"A Fool Such As I\\" which was unreleased.Slade International Fan Club newsletter, July‚ÄìAugust‚ÄìSeptember 1989. Hill performing with Slade at Weymouth Pavilion in 2016 Hill had attended the launch of a ¬£2 million appeal to raise funds for Queen Alexandra College for the Blind in Birmingham. There he heard a song called A Chance to Be, sung by blind and visually-impaired children. Hill was so moved by the occasion that he agreed to perform and produce the recording of the song. The two writers of the song were staff at the institute, Daniel Somers and Colin Baines. Hill's band name, Blessing in Disguise, was picked as the group name and the single featured ex-Shakatak female vocalist Norma Lewis rather than Holder. The b-side was a track written by Hill entitled You're the Reason that I'm Strong. It was the last recording made by the group and was released in 1991.Slade International Fan Club newsletter, July‚ÄìAugust‚ÄìSeptember 1991. Slade finally split up in 1992, but Hill decided to carry the group on as Slade II. Don Powell joined him and the band has continued to this day with various line-ups. In 1997 the name of Slade II was shortened back to Slade. The band released the album Keep on Rockin' in 1994, which has also been re-packaged as Superyob, and also as Cum on Let's Party! ==Personal life== He embraced the image of a yob for performances. As well as the references to \\"Superyob\\" above, Hill, since a young age used the numberplate \\"YOB 1\\" on his cars. Hill married his wife Jan in Mexico City in the 1970s, and they have three children: Jade, Bibi and Sam. They live in Lower Penn, Staffordshire, England, where Hill occasionally teaches music at Lower Penn School and Penn Hall School. In 2010 during a concert in Nuremberg, Germany, Hill suffered a stroke, from which he recovered to continue touring and recording. In December 2016, Hill was knocked down by a cyclist in Brighton. He suffered a broken elbow as a result of the accident, and Slade called off shows planned for early 2017. ==Autobiography== Hill published his autobiography, entitled So Here It Is: The Autobiography, in November 2017. Hill had first announced the idea of releasing a biography in the early 1990s. In a 1992 interview with the Slade fan club, he said: \\"I approached John Ogden of the Wolverhampton Express and Star with a view to putting down some of my experiences and stories, to see if a book could be produced that would be entertaining and amusing.\\" Later in November 2016, Hill announced he was in the process of writing an autobiography, with a possible 2017 release through Unbound, subject to it reaching the online pledge target. He revealed: \\"I've written my autobiography for my fans and for my family, especially my grandkids. I've got plenty of funny tales but also some others which show that my life hasn't been all rock 'n' roll.\\" So Here It Is: The Autobiography was released on 16 November 2017.

Reddy visited Bethlehem and other historically important Christian places in Israel twice. He also visited the Hindu temple of Tirupati regularly. ==Political career== Reddy joined active politics in 1978 and won the Pulivendula constituency same year and became Minister of State for Rural Development (1980‚Äì82), and later shifted to Excise Minister (1982) and Education Minister (1982‚Äì83). He continued to retain the same constituency in 1983 and 1985, even when Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao swept the power and the party fared badly in the latter, which saw Indira Gandhi making him State president of the party. He even continued the winning streak for Kadapa constituency for four terms in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Lok Sabha. His return to state politics saw him winning 1999 Assembly elections from same Pulivendula constituency during which he served as Leader of Opposition in Andhra Pradesh State Assembly (1999‚Äì2004), but his subsequent winning in 2004 Assembly elections saw him sworn in as 14th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh serving full-term. He won 2009 Assembly elections and continued his tenure as 15th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, which was abruptly cut short by his death on 2 September 2009. === Chief Ministership === ==== First term ==== During his tenure as Chief Minister, the government of Andhra Pradesh undertook the following projects: * On the first day of his tenure in 2004, he provided free electricity for farmers, a campaign project. * A health insurance program for rural people living below the poverty line (white card holders), known as Rajiv Arogya Shree, was instituted to pay the entire cost of any necessary surgery up to a maximum of . * A free public ambulance service was originally started by Satyam and then adopted by Andhra Pradesh. * The Pavala Vaddi program provided loans at 3% interest to encourage small businesses and entrepreneurship by rural women. * Indiramma illu was a program started to construct heavily subsidised housing for the rural poor. * A rice scheme provided a kilogram of rice for two rupees to reduce hunger. The minimum support price for rice was also raised. * Full reimbursement of college tuition for the underprivileged and reservations for minorities were instituted. * The main emphasis during Reddy's tenure was on social welfare, with a majority of his projects targeted at reducing rural poverty. Apart from these schemes, his government was a role model in implementing the central government's flagship program NREGA. * His tenure also saw the significant weakening of the violent extremist left-wing Naxalite movement that was rampant in the state when he assumed office in 2004. He commenced the Jala Yagnam project to irrigate of land through the construction of major, medium and minor irrigation projects. It helped Andhra Pradesh make significant progress in sustainable agriculture by making wastelands cultivable. ==== Second term ==== Reddy's major campaign slogan for the 2009 election was \\"Development and Credibility\\". He sought a mandate based on past performance, making no new election promises but vowing to continue and extend ongoing schemes. The opposition parties formed a 'Grand Alliance' (mahakootami) made up of all the major opposition parties including, Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and the communist parties. The TDP promised numerous inducements including free color televisions and a unique cash transfer scheme (CTS). There was also a new party, Praja Rajyam Party (PRP), floated by a popular film star Chiranjeevi. The Congress Party under the leadership of Reddy won the contest and came to power for a second time, winning 156 seats in the assembly (148 would be a simple majority). Reddy's party also won 33 seats in parliament out of a total of 42 seats. This feat was seen as a significant victory for Reddy, since he was able to earn a second consecutive term against the odds of anti-incumbency. He became the Congress party's first incumbent chief minister since 1969 to win based on his performance. Reddy was sworn in as the Chief Minister for the term of 2009‚Äì2014 on 20 May 2009. The ceremony was held in Hyderabad's Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium and was attended by a crowd of about 20,000 people. ==Criticism== Reddy was accused of amassing large amounts of money during his tenure as the Chief Minister. He is said to have used populist schemes like irrigation projects and housing schemes to his advantage and earn huge profits through them. In a leaked United States diplomatic cable, the American Consul General quotes that there was \\"widespread corruption that was beyond the pale even for India\\". The surrender of more than of personal land by Reddy to the government to be compliant with the law in December 2006 was criticised by opposition parties. The opposition parties demanded his resignation for owning the land in violation of the law. N. Chandrababu Naidu also called for Reddy's resignation after a 2007 Khammam police shooting resulted in eight deaths.. Even after all these criticism Mr.Reddy won General and assembly elections and Sworn in as Chief Minister again in 2009. A federal probe of the Central Bureau of Investigation was also launched to investigate disproportionate assets acquired by Reddy in return for favour his father made to the industrialists. In May 2012, the C.B.I. arrested Mopidevi Venkataramana, the then-Infrastructure Minister in Reddy's cabinet, who was responsible for unduly assigning the land to a private organisation called Vanpick. This incident called the credibility of Reddy's entire cabinet into question. ==Death== Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paying homage at the mortal remains of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy Reddy's Bell 430 helicopter went missing on Wednesday, 2 September 2009 at 9:35 am. Begumpet and Shamshabad air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at 10:02 am while it was passing through the dense Nallamala forest area. The Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh, P. Ramakanth Reddy, said that inclement weather had forced the helicopter off course. Although the sparsely populated forest area is considered to be a stronghold of the outlawed Naxal communist insurgents, the National Security Advisor of India ruled out the possibility of the Naxals bringing down the helicopter. The Indian Prime Minister's Office confirmed the helicopter's crash on the morning of 3 September and the death of all aboard, namely Reddy, his special secretary P. Subrahmanyam, chief security officer A. S. C. Wesley, Group Captain S. K. Bhatia and Captain M. S. Reddy. The Director General of Police said that the bodies were charred beyond recognition and had to be identified on the basis of clothing. The autopsy of all the bodies was carried out at Kurnool Medical College. An investigation eventually concluded that the factors that caused that crash included a problem with the transmission oil pressure system that distracted the crew from the worsening weather for more than six minutes. It was also noted that the pilots of the helicopter never discussed the bad weather, diverting, or returning to base. Reddy's body was buried on 4 September at Idupulapai in Kadapa district with full state honours in accordance with Christian rites. by the Church of South India clergy. === Aftermath === A Telugu television station, NTV, reported that as many as 122 people died of shock or committed suicide upon hearing the news of Reddy's death, many of whom were young supporters or those who benefited from his social welfare schemes. This was not, however, independently confirmed. Finance Minister Konijeti Rosaiah was sworn in as Chief Minister following Reddy's death. Six months after his death, Reddy's son Jagan began a condolence tour (Odarpu Yatra) to meet the families of those who either allegedly committed suicide or died of shock after hearing of the death of his father. The Congress party's central leadership directed Jagan to call off the Odarpu Yatra, but he refused. The tour was successful and established Jagan as a major political force in state politics. He resigned from the Congress party on 29 November 2010 and announced on 7 December 2010 from Pulivendula that he would be starting a new party within 45 days. On 16 February the YSR Congress Party came into existence with Jagan as its president. Elections for the seats left vacant due to the resignations of Jagan and Y. S. Vijayamma (Reddy's wife) were held on 8 May 2011. Contesting on behalf of the newly formed YSR Congress Party, Jagan and Vijayamma both won easily. ==Honours== *On 8 July 2010, the Government of Andhra Pradesh renamed the Kadapa district as YSR district in honour of Reddy, who was a native of that district. *On 14 Sep 2009, Andhra Cricket Association renamed ACA-VDCA cricket stadium as Dr. Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium . *In 2020, Andhra Pradesh Government declared YSR jayanti to be celebrated as Farmer's Day on 8th of july every year. ==See also== * Y.S. Jagan * Y.S.

Flexible bushings attach it to the chassis. Also visible on the right is one of the links that connect the bar to the suspension (drop link). These twist the anti-roll bar when the vehicle is cornering, resisting body roll. An anti-roll bar (roll bar, anti-sway bar, sway bar, stabilizer bar) is a part of many automobile suspensions that helps reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the suspension's roll stiffness‚Äîits resistance to roll in turns, independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction. The first stabilizer bar patent was awarded to Canadian inventor Stephen Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick on April 22, 1919.Mario Theriault, Great Maritime Inventions 1833-1950, Goose Lane Editions, 2001, p. 69 Anti-roll bars were unusual on pre-war cars due to the generally much stiffer suspension and acceptance of body roll. From the 1950s on, however, production cars were more commonly fitted with anti-roll bars, especially those vehicles with softer coil spring suspension. ==Purpose and operation== SUV, with anti roll bars removed, shows how one wheel can be much lower than the opposite side, as the body rolls (tilts) more without anti roll bars. Photo of 2 front-wheel springs, with the tires removed. Each suspension spring is connected to the central sway bar assembly. File highlighted to show anti- roll bar. An anti-sway or anti-roll bar is intended to force each side of the vehicle to lower, or rise, to similar heights, to reduce the sideways tilting (roll) of the vehicle on curves, sharp corners, or large bumps. With the bar removed, a vehicle's wheels can tilt away by much larger distances (as shown by the SUV image at right). Although there are many variations in design, a common function is to force the opposite wheel's shock absorber, spring or suspension rod to lower, or rise, to a similar level as the other wheel. In a fast turn, a vehicle tends to drop closer onto the outer wheels, and the sway bar soon forces the opposite wheel to also get closer to the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle tends to \\"hug\\" the road closer in a fast turn, where all wheels are closer to the body. After the fast turn, then the downward pressure is reduced, and the paired wheels can return to their normal height against the vehicle, kept at similar levels by the connecting sway bar. thumbOne way of estimating antiroll bar stiffness: T=Vehicle track width (inches) K=Fractional lever arm ratio (movement at roll bar / movement at wheel) d=Bar diameter (inches) R=Effective arm length (inches) L=Half length of bar (inches) S=Length of lever arm (inches) Q=Stiffness (lb*in per degree) Because each pair of wheels is cross-connected by a bar, the combined operation causes all wheels to generally offset the separate tilting of the others and the vehicle tends to remain level against the general slope of the terrain. ==Principles== A sway bar is usually a torsion spring that resists body roll motions. It is usually constructed out of a cylindrical steel bar, formed into a \\"U\\" shape, that connects to the body at two points, and at the left and right sides of the suspension. If the left and right wheels move together, the bar rotates about its mounting points. If the wheels move relative to each other, the bar is subjected to torsion and forced to twist. Each end of the bar is connected to an end link through a flexible joint. The sway bar end link connects in turn to a spot near a wheel or axle, transferring forces from a heavily loaded axle to the opposite side. Forces are therefore transferred: # from the heavily loaded axle # to the connected end link via a bushing # to the anti-sway (torsion) bar via a flexible joint # to the connected end link on the opposite side of the vehicle # to the opposite axle. The bar resists the torsion through its stiffness. The stiffness of an anti-roll bar is proportional to the stiffness of the material, the fourth power of its radius, and the inverse of the length of the lever arms (i.e., the shorter the lever arm, the stiffer the bar). Stiffness is also related to the geometry of the mounting points and the rigidity of the bar's mounting points. The stiffer the bar, the more force required to move the left and right wheels relative to each other. This increases the amount of force required to make the body roll. In a turn the sprung mass of the vehicle's body produces a lateral force at the centre of gravity (CG), proportional to lateral acceleration. Because the CG is usually not on the roll axis, the lateral force creates a moment about the roll axis that tends to roll the body. (The roll axis is a line that joins the front and rear roll centers). The moment is called the roll couple. Roll couple is resisted by the suspension roll stiffness, which is a function of the spring rate of the vehicle's springs and of the anti-roll bars, if any. The use of anti-roll bars allows designers to reduce roll without making the suspension's springs stiffer in the vertical plane, which allows improved body control with less compromise of ride quality. One effect of body (frame) lean, for typical suspension geometry, is positive camber of the wheels on the outside of the turn and negative on the inside, which reduces their cornering grip (especially with cross ply tires). === Main functions === Anti-roll bars provide two main functions. The first function is the reduction of body lean. The reduction of body lean is dependent on the total roll stiffness of the vehicle. Increasing the total roll stiffness of a vehicle does not change the steady state total load (weight) transfer from the inside wheels to the outside wheels, it only reduces body lean. The total lateral load transfer is determined by the CG height and track width. The other function of anti-roll bars is to tune the handling balance of a car. Understeer or oversteer behavior can be tuned out by changing the proportion of the total roll stiffness that comes from the front and rear axles. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the front increases the proportion of the total load transfer that the front axle reacts to‚Äîand decreases the proportion that the rear axle reacts to. In general, this makes the outer front wheel run at a comparatively higher slip angle, and the outer rear wheel to run at a comparatively lower slip angle, which is an understeer effect. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the rear axle has the opposite effect and decreases understeer. ===Drawbacks=== Because an anti-roll bar connects wheels on opposite sides of the vehicle, the bar transmits the force of a bump on one wheel to the opposite wheel. On rough or broken pavement, anti-roll bars can produce jarring, side-to-side body motions (a \\"waddling\\" sensation), which increase in severity with the diameter and stiffness of the sway bars. Other suspension techniques can delay or dampen this effect of the connecting bar. Excessive roll stiffness, typically achieved by configuring an anti-roll bar too aggressively, can make the inside wheels lift off the ground during hard cornering. This can be used to advantage: many front wheel drive production cars lift a rear wheel when cornering hard in order to overload the opposite wheel, limiting understeer. ===Adjustable bars=== Diagram of two types of adjustable antiroll bars. Some anti-roll bars, particularly those intended for use in auto racing, are externally adjustable while the car is in the pit whereas some systems can be adjusted in real time by the driver from inside the car, such as in Super GT. This allows the stiffness to be altered, for example by increasing or reducing the length of the lever arms on some systems, or by rotating a flat lever arm from a stiff edge-on position to a more flexible flat-side-on position on other systems. This lets a mechanic tune the roll stiffness for different situations without replacing the entire bar. === MacPherson struts === The MacPherson strut is a common form of strut suspension. This was not the first attempt at strut suspension, but in MacPherson's original patent, the anti-roll bar forms an integral and essential part of the suspension, in addition to its usual function in controlling body roll. A strut suspension like MacPherson's requires a hinged lower member between the chassis and wheel hub to control the wheel position both inwards and outwards (controlling the track), and also forwards and backwards. This may be provided by a wishbone with a number of joints, or by using an additional radius rod. MacPherson's design replaced the wishbone with a simpler and cheaper track control arm, with a single inboard joint, to control the track. Forward and backward position was controlled through the anti-roll bar. Overall this required a simpler and cheaper set of suspension members than with wishbones, also allowing a reduction in unsprung weight. As the anti-roll bar is required to control wheel position, the bars of a MacPherson strut suspension may be connected through ball joints. However many later \\"MacPherson strut\\" suspensions have reverted to using wishbones rather than the simplified track control arm of the original design. ==Semi active anti-roll bars== Various methods of decoupling the anti-roll bar have been proposed. The first production car to use an active anti-roll bar was the 1988 Mitsubishi Mirage Cyborg. The \\"Dual Mode Suspension\\" equipped with the 16-v turbo model has front active anti-roll bar that has a hydraulic actuator built in the anti-roll bar link. The actuator can be operated with a switch on the dash board, changing the effectiveness of the anti-roll bar between the sport mode and touring mode. The 2018 Jeep Wrangler also has a switchable decoupler on some models, to increase wheel articulation for off road work. ==Active systems== The first car to use an active anti-roll bar in 1994 was the Citroen Xantia Activa, a medium-sized sedan sold in Europe. The SC.CAR (Systeme Citro√´n de Contr√¥le Actif du Roulis) system featured an anti-roll bar that could be stiffened under the command of the suspension ECU during hard cornering. The car rolled a maximum of 2 degrees. In 2001 the BMW 7 Series (E65) introduced Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) \\"active\\" anti-roll bars that can be proportionally controlled automatically by a suspension-control computer, reducing body lean in turns while improving rough-road ride quality. In 2006 Toyota introduced its Active Stabilizer Suspension System. By altering stabilizer bar stiffness, this system acts to reduce body tilt during cornering, keeping the vehicle more level during turns and improving handling, as opposed to the natural tendency of a vehicle to roll due to the lateral forces experienced during high-speed maneuvering. The active stabilizer system relies on vehicle body sensors and electric motors. The first production usage of this system was introduced in August 2005 with the Lexus GS430 sport sedan Porsche Panamera introduced the same system Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) in 2009. In 2011, the third generation Mercedes-Benz M-Class introduced a similar system: ACTIVE CURVE SYSTEM. Range Rover Sport introduced Dynamic Response active anti-roll bars. Mercedes-Benz S-Class Active Body Control system uses another approach: the computer uses sensors to detect lateral load, lateral force, and height difference in the suspension strut, then uses hydraulic pressure to raise or lower the spring to counter roll. This system removes the anti-roll bar. Most active roll control systems allow a small degree of roll to give a more natural feel. Toyota also uses a mechanical system called Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) that essentially disengages the stabilizer bars when off-road, allowing for greater vehicle articulation and ride quality. ==See also== *Panhard rod *Torsion bar suspension ==References== Category:Canadian inventions Category:Automotive suspension technologies Automotive safety technologies Category:Auto parts Category:Mechanical power control ","title":"Anti-roll bar"},{"id":"1433465","text":"Portrait of Vilhelm Krag Vilhelm Krag (24 December 1871 ‚Äì 10 July 1933) was a Norwegian poet, author, journalist and cultural personality.

His most notable achievement is perhaps The Paragon in Blackheath. Searles was the son of a Greenwich surveyor, also named Michael Searles (c. 1722-1799), who served (from 1765) as surveyor to Morden College in Blackheath. Searles and his father formed an unofficial father and son partnership producing plans in and around Greenwich before Searles junior set up his own practice. The Paragon, Blackheath. Landowner John Cator granted development leases to Searles and builder William Dyer to design and build a series of high quality dwellings, intended to appeal to upper middle class buyers, situated on the south-east side of Blackheath. Facing the heath, South Row and Montpelier Row were erected from 1794 to 1805. However, Searles's masterpiece was the adjacent Paragon, a 14-house perfect crescent occupying a semicircular plot in the corner of the Heath. The Paragon (today Grade I listed buildings) comprises seven blocks of semi-detached houses, each linked by a single story colonnade, with a lodge house at each end. Each house was different internally: Searles would provide the buyer with a brick shell which could then be fitted out to suit the buyer‚Äôs tastes and budget. However, the scheme nearly ruined Searles financially; the development took ten years to build, with the last house not occupied until 1805.

It was later extended to a complete semicircle fronting New Kent Road by the addition of a pair of houses at each end. It was demolished in the 1890s to be replaced by more modest housing and a Council school, which has since been converted into apartments and been given the name The Paragon. ==References== Category:1750 births Category:1813 deaths Category:18th-century English architects Category:People from Greenwich Category:Architects from London ","title":"Michael Searles"},{"id":"1433480","text":"Mineralnye Vody (Min-Vody) (; lit. mineral waters) () is a town in Stavropol Krai, Russia, located along the Kuma River and the main rail line between Rostov-on-Don in Russia and Baku in Azerbaijan.

The functions of a military attach√© are illustrated by actions of U.S. military attach√©s in Japan around the time of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904‚Äì1905. A series of military officers had been assigned to the American diplomatic mission in Tokyo since 1901, when the U.S. and Japan were co-operating closely in response to the Boxer Rebellion of 1899-1901 in China. The military attach√© advised the United States Ambassador to Japan on military matters, acted as a liaison between United States Army and the Imperial General Headquarters, and gathered and disseminated intelligence. The military attach√©'s office in Tokyo usually had two assistants and a number of \\"language officers\\" who were assigned specifically to learn Japanese while attached to Imperial Japanese Army regiments as observers. These \\"language officers\\" translated training and technical manuals and reported on conditions in Japanese military units.Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, King's College London: US Military Intelligence Reports, Japan, Context During the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), military attach√©s from many Western military organizations served as observers with the land and naval forces of Russia and of Japan. The United States Army detailed eight officers to serve as military attach√©s with opposing forces in the field; and all served from the start of hostilities in 1904 through the signing of the peace protocols in September 1905.Cullen, Glen T. (1999). \\"Preparing for battle: Learning Lessons in the US Army during World War I,\\" p. 16. U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. After the war, the reports of British officers attached to the Japanese forces in the field were combined and published in four volumes._____. (1907). The Russo-Japanese War, Reports from British Officers Attached to the Japanese Forces in the Field, Vol. I; (1908). Vol. II. During this conflict, some attach√©s served primarily in Manchuria, and others served primarily in Tokyo. Some, like Italian naval officer Ernesto Burzagli, saw service both at sea and in Tokyo. The agreed conditions that allow military attach√©s to gather information can be misunderstood with fatal results. United States military attach√© Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson was killed March 24, 1985, while photographing a military installation in East Germany northwest of Berlin. He was reportedly observing from a point not marked off- limits, though near a place that was. According to Sgt. Jessie Schatz, Nicholson's driver, there were no warning shots and the Soviets refused to give Nicholson medical attention for nearly an hour. This activity had been agreed to by the United States and the Soviet Union. Such agreements stemmed from negotiations between United States and Soviet commanders in Germany back in 1947. Soviet liaison-teams were conducting similar missions in West Germany. These tours had evolved into a legalized form of intelligence- gathering, usually accepted by both sides. The killing became a diplomatic incident. In retaliation, the United States expelled Soviet military attach√© Stanislav Gromov. Mr. Gromov was apparently selected for his effectiveness in collecting intelligence on the United States for the Soviet Union from his post in Washington. ==See also== * Air attach√© * Ambassador * Arms industry * Defense Attach√© System (US) * Military attach√©s and observers in the Russo- Japanese War * Military attach√©s and war correspondents in the First World War * Science attach√© * Service in Israel Medal * United Nations Military Observer ==Notes and references== ==References== * Cullen, Glen T.

It was introduced in the 1890s, and is still one of the most common cartridges in modern rifles built for the Scandinavian market today. The cartridge was developed in a joint Norwegian and Swedish effort starting in 1891 for use in the new service rifles then under consideration by the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway.Hanevik, Karl Egil (1998). Norske Milit√¶rgev√¶rer etter 1867 In 1893, the cartridge was standardized and adopted under the name to facilitate logistical cooperation between Norway and Sweden. The two nations had independent armies and consequently the normal procedure at the time was for their respective governments to use the same ammunition and then purchase small arms of their choice. Norway adopted the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen M/1894 rifle, while Sweden adopted the Mauser m/1896 rifle design that was based on a Mauser service rifle designed around the 7√ó57mm Mauser cartridge. The 6.5√ó55mm cartridge has a smaller bullet diameter and lower free recoil than other full- power service rifle cartridges like the later developed 8√ó57mm, .30-06 Springfield and 7.62√ó51mm NATO. Thanks in part to its relatively roomy case which was designed for loading long, heavy 6.7 mm bullets, and a diameter bolt face, it has proven more successful than other first-generation smokeless- powder military cartridges of similar bullet calibers, such as the 6√ó60mm US Navy, 6.5√ó54mm Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer, 6.5√ó53mmR Dutch Mannlicher, 6.5√ó52mm Carcano and 6.5√ó50mm Arisaka. While the original and colloquial cartridge name is 6.5√ó55mm, there are some variations in chamberings.

In 1891, the Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission started its work. After extensive ballistic tests where different calibers were tested (8 mm, 7.5 mm, 7 mm, 6.5 mm etc.), the optimal caliber was determined to be 6.5 mm (0.256 in). Following this decision, a joint Norwegian-Swedish commission was established in December 1893. This commission worked through a series of meetings to decide on the different measurements for the cartridge case. A rimless cartridge case of 55 mm length was approved, and each possible measurement (diameter at base, diameter at neck, angle of case, angle of shoulder etc.) was decided upon. The corresponding dimensions of the cartridge chamber to be used in a future service rifle was also determined. At the time of its development the 6.5√ó55mm was a high-performance smokeless-powder cartridge. The design of the joint Norwegian-Swedish commission was subsequently adopted by the Norwegian and Swedish governments, and entered service in the Norwegian and Swedish militaries. The cartridge was also adopted by the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish civilian shooting associations DDS, DFS and FSR. In 1984, the C.I.P. independently standardized the cartridge as , and revisioned their standard in 2002 and 2007.C.I.P. TDCC datasheet 6,5 x 55 SE In 1990, a specification was introduced along with the Scandinavian target rifle by the Scandinavian shooting associations DDS, DFS and FSR with the designation which tightened up the original tolerances (minimum and maximum dimensions) of the 1893 design standard, added a slightly longer chamber space for the neck for increased safety with untrimmed reloads, and increased the pressure rating. The SKAN chambering is approved for firing any 6.5√ó55mm cartidges satisfying the aforementioned C.I.P. and SAAMI standards. In 1993, the SAAMI also independently standardized the cartridge as 6.5√ó55mm Swedish, with the official SAAMI abbreviation being 6.5√ó55. The closest European and American ballistic twins of the 6.5√ó55mm are probably the German 6.5√ó57mm Mauser and the American .260 Remington cartridges. While the 6.5√ó57mm and 6.5√ó55mm both require a long action receiver, the shorter .260 Remington being (based on the .308 Winchester cartridge) can be fitted to a short bolt action format. Other 21st century cartridges like the 6.5√ó47mm Lapua and the 6.5mm Creedmoor that have entered the market also are able to provide similar performance to factory 6.5√ó55mm ammunition. However, the extra case volume of the 6.5√ó55mm promotes a longer lifespan of the cartridge case when reloading, and will provide higher velocities when handloaded to the same pressure as its more modern counterparts. However, the approved chamber pressure ratings for older rifles then may be exceeded. == Cartridge specifications == === Original specifications === All Swedish Mauser bolt actions were proof tested with a single 6.5√ó55mm proof round developing approximately piezo pressure (55,000 CUP).de Haas, Frank, Bolt Action Rifles, Northfield, Illinois: DBI Books, Inc. (1984), , p. 31 ===Swedish and Norwegian chamber differences rumour=== Some historians have assumed that there was a difference in cartridge blueprint measurements between Swedish and Norwegian 6.5√ó55mm ammunition, but this may be unintentional. Due to different interpretations of the blueprint standard, i.e. the standards of manufacturing using maximum chamber in the Krag vs. minimum chamber in the Swedish Mauser, a small percentage of the ammunition produced in Norway proved to be slightly oversize when chambered in the Swedish Mauser action, i.e. requiring a push on the bolt handle to chamber in the Swedish arm.. A rumour arose not long after the 6.5√ó55mm cartridge was adopted that one could use Swedish ammunition in Norwegian rifles, but not Norwegian ammunition in Swedish rifles. Some even alleged that this incompatibility was deliberate, to give Norway the tactical advantage of using captured ammunition in a war, while denying the same advantage to Sweden. However, after the rumour first surfaced in 1900, the issue was examined by the Swedish military. They declared the difference to be insignificant, and that both the Swedish and Norwegian ammunition were within the specified parameters laid down. Despite this finding, the Swedish weapon-historian Josef Alm repeated the rumour in a book in the 1930s, leading many to believe that there was a significant difference between the ammunition manufactured in Norway and Sweden. === C.I.P. specifications === The 6.5√ó55mm has 3.75 ml (57.9 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions. 400px 6.5√ó55mm maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions.

According to the official C.I.P. rulings the 6.5√ó55mm can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that 6.5√ó55mm chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are currently (2013) proof tested at PE piezo pressure. === SAAMI specifications === The SAAMI maximum average pressure (MAP) for this cartridge is piezo pressure (46,000 CUP).ANSI/SAAMI Velocity & Pressure Data: Centerfire Rifle === SKAN specifications === The SKAN specification was introduced to tighten up the original tolerances of the 1893 design standard.

From 1941 onwards, Sweden, which remained neutral during World War II, adopted skarp patron m/94 prickskytte m/41 (live cartridge m/94 sharpshooting m/41) ammunition loaded with a spitzer bullet (D-projectile) fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel.Swedish Military Rifles 1894 - 1995 Besides a pointed nose the m/41 D-projectile also had a boat tail. Originally developed for the m/41 sniper rifle, this new cartridge replaced the m/94 ammunition loaded with the M/94 projectile for general use. Besides the two skarp patron (live full metal jacket ball cartridge) variants various other military 6.5√ó55mm ammunition types like enhanced precision, armor piercing, tracer, blank, inert and training cartridges were available. Swedish blanks or l√∂s patron were loaded with bullet shaped wooden projectiles that were painted red. To fire these blanks the Swedish military used a Blank Firing Attachment (BFA). These adapters were mounted on the muzzle and designed to shred the wooden projectile as it exited the muzzle to prevent injuries to nearby people and to allow functioning of automatic weapons. The Swedish 6.5√ó55mm military ammunition was loaded to piezo pressure. The maximum pressure (Pmax) for Swedish military ammunition was .Ammunitionsregister f√∂r arm√©n, 1960 That is significantly below the civilian (Pmax) standards. ===Norwegian service=== The 6.5√ó55mm cartridge was used by Norway in the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen bolt-action rifle and in the Madsen machine gun, as well as in several prototype self-loading rifles. ===Swedish service=== In Swedish service, the 6.5√ó55mm cartridge was used in the Swedish Mauser family of bolt action arms comprising the m/94 (Model 1894) carbine, m/96 (Model 1896) long rifle, m/38 (Model 1938) short rifle and m/41 (Model 1941) sniper rifle and the Ag m/42 semi-automatic rifle.Jones, D: Crown Jewels: The Mauser in Sweden, pp. 37, 59, 81, 93. Collector Grade Publications, 2003. The Swedish Mauser arms had a relatively tight 200 mm (1 in 7.87 in) twist rate optimized for stabilizing the relatively long heavy bullets used in the Swedish 6.5√ó55mm military service ammunition. It was also used in several light, medium and heavy machine guns such as the Schwarzlose, Browning BAR, Kg/1940 Light machine gun, Bren Gun, Browning M1917, Browning M1919 and FN MAG. The FN MAG was eventually returned to its original 7.62√ó51mm NATO chambering when the Swedish armed forces switched to that cartridge as its standard during the post-World War II era. ===Danish Service=== In 1946 Denmark made a standard cartridge with two different bullets. The 6.5 mm skarppatroner m/46-ru had a rundspids (round tip) bullet (like the Swedish projektil m/94) for use with Danish Krag rifles by the Home Guard. The 6.5 mm skarppatroner m/46-sp had a spidsskarp (pointed tip) bullet (like the projektil m/41) for use in more modern firearms like the Swedish Mauser. ==Sporting use== Expanding bullet loaded in a 6.5√ó55mm before and after expanding. The long base and small expanded diameter show that this is a bullet designed for deep penetration on large game. The bullet in the photo traveled more than halfway through a moose before coming to rest, performing as designed. The 6.5√ó55mm cartridge is highly esteemed as a hunting round in Europe (particularly in Scandinavia), and North America. It is used for killing most kind of game including reindeer and moose in Scandinavia, while in most other countries it is used for killing deer and other medium- sized game. Sportsmen who favor the round laud the combination of low recoil coupled with the cartridge's inherent accuracy and superb penetrative qualities due to the high obtainable sectional density. Despite its enduring popularity amongst a devoted niche of American sportsmen, U.S. rifle manufacturers have, for the most part, ignored the cartridge. As of 2014 there were at least four mainstream American arms manufacturers, Thompson Center, Barrett Firearms (Fieldcraft), Remington (Model 700), and Ruger producing a sporting rifle in chambered for the 6.5√ó55mm. European rifle makers including Blaser, CZ, Sauer & Sohn, Steyr, and Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH offer sporting rifles chambered for this cartridge, as does the Finnish arms manufacturer SAKO/Tikka, and Japanese manufacturer Howa, while ammunition manufacturers such as Norma, Lapua, Prvi Partizan, RUAG Ammotec, Remington Arms, and Hornady offer loadings of the 6.5√ó55mm round that are designed for use only in modern hunting rifles that can tolerate higher chamber pressures. Finnish powder manufacturer Vihtavuori warns modern Pmax piezo pressure loadings should never be used in the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen or Swedish Mauser or similar older rifles. This warning is relevant as the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish national shooting organizations strive to keep the costs of participating in their shooting events reasonable. Their rulings restrict the use of very expensive highly specialized target rifles by allowing only the use of their respective (historic) military service rifles and the SIG Sauer 200 STR rifle. Because 6.5 mm (.264\\") bullets have relatively high ballistic coefficients, the 6.5√ó55mm has seen success in long range target matches of . The 6.5√ó55mm cartridge was widely used in fullbore biathlon biathlon competitions until 1975 (when it was replaced by the .22 Long Rifle (.22 LR) rimfire cartridge), because of its inherent accuracy and historical popularity with the Scandinavian nations who have dominated this sport. The 6.5√ó55mm was and is used for target shooting disciplines like F-Class and benchrest. The cartridge is also used by Scandinavian target shooters that use the Sauer 200 STR (Scandinavian Target Rifle) as their competition rifle. Metallic silhouette shooters also use the 6.5√ó55mm. In North America the 6.5√ó55mm was the third most frequently mentioned caliber for hunter rifle at the 2003 Metallic silhouette Nationals. ===Wildcats=== The 6.5√ó55mm case is also used as the parent case for modified variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or SAAMI. Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as wildcats. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game. Because the 6.5√ó55mm offers a relatively wide short cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times it has been used by wildcatters. With the 6.5√ó55mm as the parent case wildcatters have created the 6.5√ó55mm Ackley Improved In the 6.5√ó55mm Ackley Improved the cartridge case capacity is raised to approximately 4.03 ml (62.2 grains H2O). The Ackley Improved family of wildcat cartridges are designed to be easily made by rechambering existing firearms, and fireforming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity. ==See also== * 6 mm caliber * List of rifle cartridges * List of Swedish military calibers * Table of handgun and rifle cartridges * .256 Gibbs Magnum ==References== == Further reading == * Accurate Smokeless Powders Loading Guide Number Two (Revised), Book by Accurate Arms Co, Wolfe Publishing, 2000 p. 229 * CIP CD-ROM Edition 2003 ==External links== * 6.5√ó55mm cartridge dimensions * Ballistic Studies 6.5x55mm * SAAMI Drawing 6.5x55 Swedish Category:6.5√ó55mm firearms Category:Military cartridges Category:Military equipment of Denmark Category:Military equipment of Norway Category:Military equipment of Sweden Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 1894 ","title":"6.5√ó55mm Swedish"},{"id":"1433512","text":"alt=A group of women gathered around a table in an outdoor setting, dressed in a mix of casual and dressy styles. At the left of the image is a woman wearing a veil on the back of her head A hen night (UK and Ireland) or bachelorette party (United States) is a party held for a woman who is about to get married. While Beth Montemurro concludes that the bachelorette party is modelled after the centuries-old stag night in the US, which is itself historically a dinner given by the bridegroom to his friends shortly before his wedding, Sheila Young argues that its British counterpart evolved from a number of earlier pre-wedding traditions for women (Ribbon Girl, Pay Off, Bosola, Taking Out, Jumping the Chanty, to name but a few) whose origins are obscure but which have been around for at least a century in factories and offices across the UK.Young, Sheila, 'Prenuptial Rituals in Scotland: Blackening the Bride and Decorating the Hen' (Lexington Books, 2019) Despite its reputation as \\"a sodden farewell to maiden days\\" or \\"an evening of debauchery\\", these events can simply be parties given in honor of the bride-to-be, in the style that is common to that social circle. ==Terminology== The term bachelorette party is common in the United States. In the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada it is known as a hen(s) party, hen(s) night or hen(s) do, while the terms hens party or hens night are common in Australia and New Zealand. The term stagette is occasionally used in Canada. It may also be referred to as a girls' night out or kitchen tea (South Africa in particular) or other terms in other English- speaking countries. Other pre-wedding celebrations, such as bridesmaids luncheons, are often held instead of bachelorette parties due to the latter's association with licentiousness in some countries since the 1980s. ==History== Before its usage as a term for a pre-wedding party, hen party was used in the United States as a general term for an all-female gathering, usually held at a hostess's residence. In 1897, The Deseret News noted that a hen party was a \\"time honored idea that tea and chitchats, gossip smart hats, constitute the necessary adjuncts to these particular gatherings\\". In 1940 Eleanor Roosevelt was described as hosting a Christmas-time hen party for cabinet wives and \\"ladies of the press\\". The bachelorette party is consciously modeled after the centuries-old bachelor's party, which is itself historically a black tie dinner given by the bridegroom, or sometimes his father, shortly before his wedding. === Modern adaptations === A woman dancing on the bar at a bachelorette party in the US The practise of giving a party to honour the bride-to-be goes back for centuries. However, certain American bachelorette party customs involving licentiousness among some social groups may have begun during the sexual revolution of the 1960s. It was uncommon until at least the mid-1980s, and the first book on planning bachelorette parties was published only in 1998. Those uncomfortable with these modern customs of debauchery often celebrate the night before their wedding with a combined stag and doe party, a custom that has become increasingly popular. Author Beth Montemurro has tied the cultural significance of a bachelorette party to concepts of gender equality. The phrase \\"hen party\\" mirrors the male \\"stag party\\" in referencing social stereotypes of each gender at the party. Since the 1980s, many parties in honor of the bride-to-be that were labeled as bachelorette parties often involved displays of sexual freedom philosophy, such as trading intimate secrets, getting drunk, and watching male strippers. Parties that honored the bride-to-be without them avoided that label. Now, however, the term is used for a wide variety of parties. Bachelorette parties became especially popular around the turn of the 21st century and frequently appeared in the news. In 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rise in Virtual Hen Parties with bride-to-be's celebrating their 'last night of freedom' with their bridesmaids around the world via videotelephony apps such as Zoom and Houseparty. ==Entertainment== Topless butlers serving guests at a hen party Many different kinds of entertainment are selected, depending on what the organizers think will best please their guest of honor. While notions of a bachelorette party as a night of drunken debauchery have persisted in some social circles since the 1980s, it is becoming widely seen in America as an opportunity for female bonding. According to etiquette expert Peggy Post, \\"Whatever entertainment is planned, it should not embarrass, humiliate, or endanger the honoree or any of the guests.\\" When held in a private venue, such as the hostess's home, the party may take any form that pleases the hostesses and honors the bride-to-be. Dinners and cocktail parties, which provide comfortable opportunities for participants to talk or to give intimate advice to the bride-to-be, are common. Other hostesses choose a themed party, such as a \\"pamper party,\\" with guests indulging in spa treatments, or a cooking class. While proposing a toast to the bride-to-be is common at most bachelorette parties, some center on drinking games. In the 21st century, many companies sell products aimed at the organizers of bachelorette parties, including packs of themed games, pre-printed invitations, decorations, novelties, and sex toys. A common theme of parties is male nudity. In North America, it is common in some social circles to hire a male stripper or attend a male strip club. Life drawing parties featuring a nude male model might also be held. In the UK, a naked butler has become a common theme and a popular hen party idea. The naked butler is often dressed in just a collar, dickie bow, cuffs and a short apron or trunks. He will wait on the hen and her party including serving drinks and food as well as hosting or taking part in hen party games and entertainment. An extension of this concept that has also become popular in the UK is the hiring of a naked chef to cater for the guests often accompanied by a naked butler to serve the food and drinks. ==Organization== Participants are often all women. Bridesmaids (if any) are typically invited, but any of the bride's close friends may be included. This party is typically hosted by one or more members of the wedding party, although it is possible for any friend to host a party in honor of the bride-to-be. Formally, a party in honor of the bride-to-be is never hosted by the bride-to-be, although she may participate in its planning. While it is normally the duty of a hostess to pay for the entertainment she gives her guests, it is common in most English- speaking countries for participants to share the costs of this event. Whether the bride-to-be pays her share, or whether her share is divided between other participants is determined by the organizers and the bride-to-be during the early stages of the planning process. Participating in a bachelorette party is always optional, and many brides decline these parties altogether. Neither bridesmaids nor other friends can be required either to attend or to pay for any part of this party. Since it is derived from a formal dinner, a bachelorette party is properly held in the evening, usually about a week (or at least a few days) before the wedding, and usually includes dinner, although alternative approaches are not uncommon. ==Role of alcohol== In the early 21st century, some bachelorette parties rivaled the drunkenness seen in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties. However, sober bachelorette parties are not unusual. Many brides and guests are staying sober in recovery from alcoholism or are not drinking alcoholic beverages due to pregnancy or health issues, for religious reasons, or because they do not want to drink alcohol. Sober parties focus on building relationships and activities beyond hanging out at a place that serves alcohol. ==Location== Many bachelorette parties are held at home or at a nearby restaurant. Some people turn a bachelorette party into a weekend trip to another city. Some cities, such as Austin for people in the southwestern US and Nashville for people in the Upper Midwest, are relatively popular with U.S. bridal parties that are seeking a weekend destination and can afford to pay hundreds of dollars per person for the experience. Other people will travel farther to cities such as Las Vegas. In the UK, parties in relatively inexpensive European destinations such as Latvia and the Canary Islands are popular. One reason that bridal parties travel to a different city is because they want to behave differently than they normally would, but they do not want to deal with the social repercussions that might ensue if friends, family members, or professional acquaintances saw them doing this. When large numbers of bachelor and bachelorette parties choose the same cities, this can produce extra jobs and new businesses to cater to them, but it also draws complaints from local residents who are faced with the disruption and public service costs caused by the seasonal influx of noisy parties and drunken visitors. Stag parties caused so much disruption in Riga, Latvia that the city formed a police group specifically to deal with bachelor and bachelorette parties. ==Alternatives== A more traditional alternative is the bridesmaids luncheon, hosted by friends of the bride's mother or mothers of the bridesmaids, usually given the day before the wedding. Attendees include the bridesmaids, their mothers and close female friends and relatives; the event is often multi-generational including mothers and even grandmothers of the bride and groom. At a bridesmaids luncheon, the bride often presents a small gift to each bridesmaid. The purpose of the luncheon is for the bride to thank her attendants and includes presenting them with bridesmaid gifts. This is also the time when the bridesmaids' gift, if any, is customarily given to the bride. If there is a cake, it may contain symbolic good luck charms. If a significant aspect of the party is presenting small gifts to the bride-to-be, then the event is properly called a bridal shower. For the convenience of the bride-to-be, bridal showers are usually held earlier than a bachelorette party. ===Canada=== In Canada a stag and doe party, also called a \\"Jack and Jill\\", \\"buck and doe\\" or \\"hag\\" (hen + stag) party, is a fundraising party that includes both men and women. These parties are held by couples wishing to distance themselves from the licentiousness associated with many post-1980s bachelorette parties and are becoming increasingly popular, especially as a means to financially support a wedding. ==References== ==External links== * *HALFWAY TO PARADISE: HEN PARTY (1989) (archive film about a hen night in Glasgow - from the National Library of Scotland: SCOTTISH SCREEN ARCHIVE) Category:Parties Category:Pre-wedding Category:Rites of passage Category:Women in society Category:Women-only spaces Category:Women's culture da:Polterabend ","title":"Bachelorette party"},{"id":"1433530","text":"Early Dynastic Period may refer to: *Early Dynastic Period (Egypt) *Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) ","title":"Early Dynastic Period"},{"id":"1433534","text":"Greg Gumbel (born May 3, 1946) is an American television sportscaster. He is best known for his various assignments for CBS Sports (most notably, the National Football League, NBA and NCAA basketball). The older brother of news and sportscaster Bryant Gumbel, he became the first African-American (and Creole) announcer to call play-by-play of a major sports championship in the United States when he announced Super Bowl XXXV for the CBS network in 2001. He is of Creole ancestry. Gumbel is currently a play-by-play broadcaster for the NFL on CBS as well as the studio host for CBS' men's college basketball coverage. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Gumbel was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the first child of parents Richard Gumbel, a judge, and Rhea Alice LeCesne. As a young man, Gumbel grew up on Chicago's South Side, where he attended and graduated from De La Salle Institute. Before becoming a broadcaster, Gumbel graduated with a B.A. degree in English from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa where he also played on the baseball team. He also has two sisters, Renee Gumbel-Farrahi and Rhonda Gumbel- Thomas.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1990-07-05-9002250030-story.htmlCBS Indianapolis Colts vs Chicago Bears October 4th 2020 - 6 minutes left in the 3rd ===Career=== In 1973, Greg's brother Bryant, then working as a television sportscaster at KNBC in Los Angeles, informed him that another NBC owned and operated station, WMAQ-TV in Chicago, was auditioning for a sports announcer. At the time, Greg was selling hospital supplies in Detroit. He ultimately got the job, returned to Chicago and worked at WMAQ-TV for seven years. The sportscaster he replaced, Dennis Swanson, went on to become president of ABC Sports. Prior to his rising to prominence at CBS, Gumbel worked for MSG, ESPN, and WFAN radio in New York City. At ESPN, he anchored the show SportsCenter and did \\"play-by-play\\" for early NBA games. On MSG, Gumbel served as a backup announcer for Marv Albert on New York Knicks broadcasts as well as providing coverage for college basketball. When MSG signed a huge contract to broadcast New York Yankees games in 1989, Gumbel served as host of the pregame and postgame shows. In addition to his MSG duties, he was the host of the first radio morning show on radio station WFAN. ====First CBS stint==== Gumbel's CBS career began with part-time work as an NFL announcer in 1988. Also in 1989, Gumbel began announcing college basketball as well. He became host of The NFL Today (alongside Terry Bradshaw) for the 1990 to 1993 seasons. He also anchored CBS' coverage of Major League Baseball, college football, and, in 1999, CBS' coverage for the Daytona 500. Besides his hosting duties, Gumbel provided play-by-play for the NBA (alongside Quinn Buckner), Major League Baseball including the 1993 American League Championship Series (alongside Jim Kaat), and College World Series baseball. He was the prime time anchor for the 1994 Winter Olympic Games from Lillehammer, Norway and co-anchor for the weekday morning broadcasts of the 1992 Winter Olympics from Albertville, France. ====NBC Sports==== Gumbel moved to NBC in 1994 following CBS' losses of the NFL and Major League Baseball broadcasting contracts (Gumbel's last on-air assignment for CBS was providing play-by-play for the College World Series). While at NBC, Gumbel hosted NBC's coverage of the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He also did play-by-play for the 1995 Major League Baseball National League Division Series and National League Championship Series (on both occasions, teaming with Joe Morgan), did play-by-play for The NBA on NBC, hosted NBC's daytime coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics from Atlanta, Georgia, hosted the 1995 World Championships of Figure Skating, and served as the studio host for The NFL on NBC. ====Current CBS career==== Gumbel left NBC after the network broadcast of Super Bowl XXXII to return to CBS. His first major assignment was to serve as studio host for the network's coverage of college basketball, including the NCAA men's basketball tournament, something he continues to do to this day. As CBS had just acquired the rights to NBC's previous NFL package, Gumbel joined the broadcast team as the lead announcer with fellow NBC alumnus Phil Simms as his color man. Gumbel was the lead announcer for the NFL on CBS between 1998 and 2003, calling Super Bowls XXXV and XXXVIII. For the 2004 NFL season, Gumbel traded positions with Jim Nantz as host of The NFL Today with Nantz taking over as lead announcer. At the end of the 2005 NFL season, Gumbel was replaced as studio host of The NFL Today by James Brown. Gumbel returned to the broadcast booth as the #2 play-by-play man, replacing Dick Enberg, alongside color man Dan Dierdorf until Dierdorf retired after the 2013‚Äì14 NFL season. Gumbel also worked alongside Trent Green in the #3 team as of 2014. ===Personal life=== Greg, his wife Marcy, brother Bryant, and Greg's married daughter Michelle all reside in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida area. ===Politics=== In 1999, Gumbel refused to attend a NASCAR banquet honoring Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on the basis that he disagreed with Thomas' positions on political issues. He has regularly appeared on Howard Stern's radio show. Along similar lines, Gumbel said of Rush Limbaugh, \\"I find him someone whose words and opinions I can do without.\\" ==Legacy== Gumbel is the third man to serve as both host and play-by-play announcer for Super Bowls (the first two were Dick Enberg and Al Michaels respectively). He hosted Super Bowls XXVI, XXX, and XXXII before calling Super Bowls XXXV and XXXVIII. Jim Nantz became the fourth man to do so after he called Super Bowl XLI for CBS. During his tenure as the chief anchor of The NFL Today, he served alongside co-anchors Dan Marino, Shannon Sharpe, and Boomer Esiason. The group was known to call him by his nickname \\"Gumby\\". ==Career timeline== *1979‚Äì1988: ESPN ‚Äì Reporter, Anchor, Play-by-play *1989: MSG Network New York Yankees ‚Äì Play-by-play *1989‚Äì1994: College Basketball on CBS ‚Äì Play-by-play *1990‚Äì1993; 2004‚Äì2005: The NFL Today ‚Äì Studio host *1991: Seattle Mariners Television ‚Äì Play-by-play *1992‚Äì1993: Cleveland Cavaliers Television ‚Äì Play-by-Play *1992: Winter Olympics ‚Äì Weekend morning host *1994: Winter Olympics ‚Äì Primetime host *1994: Major League Baseball All-Star Game ‚Äì Host *1994‚Äì1995: MLB on NBC ‚Äì #2 Play-by-play *1994‚Äì1998: NFL on NBC ‚Äì Studio host *1994‚Äì1998: NBA on NBC ‚Äì #2 Play-by-play *1995: World Figure Skating Championships ‚Äì Host *1998‚Äì2004: NFL on CBS ‚Äì Lead play-by-play *1998‚Äìpresent: College Basketball on CBS ‚Äì Studio host *1990‚Äì1994; 2000‚Äì2002: College World Series on CBS ‚Äì Play-by-play *2006‚Äìpresent: NFL on CBS ‚Äì Play-by-play (2006‚Äì2013: #2) ==External links== *CBS Sports Team ‚Äì CBS SportsLine.com *Issue 44 ‚Äì Television Sportscasters (African-American) * ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:African-American sports journalists Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:American sports journalists Category:American television sports announcers Category:American sports radio personalities Category:College basketball announcers in the United States Category:College football announcers Category:De La Salle Institute alumni Category:Figure skating commentators Category:Loras College alumni Category:Louisiana Creole people Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Motorsport announcers Category:National Football League announcers Category:Television anchors from New York City Category:New York Giants broadcasters Category:New York Knicks broadcasters Category:New York Yankees broadcasters Category:Olympic Games broadcasters Category:Seattle Mariners broadcasters Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Sportspeople from New Orleans Category:Sportspeople from Orlando, Florida ","title":"Greg Gumbel"},{"id":"1433535","text":"President Adams may refer to: * John Adams (1735-1826), 2nd President of the United States ** Presidency of John Adams, his presidency * John Quincy Adams (1767-1848), 6th President of the United States and son of the 2nd President ** Presidency of John Quincy Adams, his presidency ==Other uses== * , named for the 2nd President * , named for both the 2nd and 6th Presidents ==See also== * Adams (disambiguation) * Adams political family ","title":"President Adams"},{"id":"1433541","text":"True West is a play by American playwright Sam Shepard.

He is well educated and has a wife and children. *Lee ‚Äì A drifter and a thief, he is Austin's older brother. *Mom ‚Äì Austin and Lee's mother. *Saul Kimmer ‚Äì A Hollywood producer. ==Plot== ===Act One=== True West is about the sibling rivalry between two estranged brothers who have reconnected. The play begins with brothers Austin and Lee sitting in their mother's house. This is the first time they've seen one another in five years. The two are not on good terms, but Austin attempts to appease his older brother, who is more dominant. We learn that their mother is on vacation in Alaska and that Austin is house sitting. Austin is trying to work on his screenplay but Lee continually distracts him with nonsense questions. The two brothers seem on edge with one another. When Austin suggests that Lee leave, Lee threatens to steal things from the neighborhood. Austin calms him down and the night ends with the two of them on neutral. Lee talks about the security level of their mother's house, and how Lee went into the desert to find their dad. Austin then tells Lee to leave the house because a film producer, Saul, is coming by to look at Austin's screenplay (described as a ‚Äúperiod piece‚Äù). Lee agrees to leave in exchange for Austin's car keys. Austin is reluctant at first but eventually relents and Lee promises that he will have it back by six. Lee departs. Saul and Austin are discussing their agreement when Lee enters with a stolen television set. Saul and Lee discuss golf and make plans to play the next day, excluding Austin because he doesn't play, despite his desire that Lee have nothing to do with Saul. Lee proposes a script idea to Saul and Saul reacts positively. Lee describes his story out loud. Austin writes it down, but stops, saying it doesn't resemble real life. The two brothers quarrel and Austin asks Lee for his car keys back. Lee assumes Austin is trying to make him leave, and Lee says he can't be kicked out. Austin says he wouldn't kick him out because he's his brother. Lee counters that being brothers means nothing because in-family murders are most common. Austin assures him they won't be driven to murder over a movie script. The two admit to being envious of each other's lives, Lee returns the car keys and the scene closes with Austin typing Lee's story. ===Act Two=== Lee returns from his golf game at noon, with a set of golf clubs that Saul has given him. He tells Austin that the clubs are part of an advance that Saul has promised him for the story idea outline that he \\"dictated\\" to Austin. They celebrate until Lee informs Austin that he expects Austin to write the screenplay. Austin questions this, knowing he has his own work, but Lee goes on to inform him that Saul has chosen to drop Austin's screenplay. Austin warns Lee that he needs to be careful with messing about with this line of work and that he has a lot at stake on his own project. The scene ends with Austin threatening to leave and go to the desert as Lee tries to calm him down. Austin confronts Saul about his decision to buy Lee's screenplay. He argues that Saul only offered to buy the screenplay because he lost a bet on the golf course. Saul wants Austin to write both his and Lee's story, but Austin refuses. Austin thinks that Lee's story is without merit or plausibility. Due to Austin's rejection of the job, Saul decides to drop Austin's story and to find a different writer for Lee's story. The scene ends with Saul making plans for lunch with Lee. Austin is drunk and annoying Lee, who is now at the typewriter, laboriously trying, hunt-and-peck style, to type out a screenplay. Austin taunts his brother with advice and says that this is the first time he has enjoyed spending time with Lee since he arrived. He insists that Lee is not a real screenwriter, and when Lee informs him that he has an advance coming on his script, Austin claims he could burgle houses just as well as Lee can. Lee bets that he couldn't even steal a toaster, but they can't agree on the stakes. Instead Lee asks in earnest for Austin's help with the technical parts of the writing, offering to pay him money and then disappear like their father did and leave Austin alone. Austin argues about how well their father ended up, and the scene closes as they drink together. Austin is polishing toasters that he stole while Lee is smashing a typewriter early in the morning. The two continue to do this while they are carrying on a conversation. Austin is proud of what he has done. Lee wants to see a woman, but Austin refuses because he is married. Lee throws a fit while on the phone with the operator because he cannot find a pen to write down what the operator is saying. In his search for a pen or pencil, Lee strews the contents of all the kitchen drawers on the floor. Austin begs Lee to go to the desert with him because he thinks there is nothing for him where he is. The brothers make a deal that Austin will write the play for Lee if Lee takes him to the desert. In the final scene, the house is in shambles, and Lee and Austin are working vigorously on their script when their mother walks in the door, suitcases in hand. She stares at her sons, mouth agape, until Lee finally notices her. She is stunned by her sons' appearance and the state of her house. Austin tells her that he and Lee are going to take off into the desert, but Lee says they might have to postpone the trip because he doesn't think Austin is cut out for the desert life-style. Austin responds by attempting to strangle Lee with the telephone cord, and their mother storms out of the house. Lee ceases struggling and lies inert, and Austin finally lets go. He is worried for a second that he's killed his brother. As Austin moves for the door, Lee rises with fire in his eyes. The two brothers face one another, fists raised, as the lights fade. ==Productions== True West was first performed at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco, where Shepard was the resident playwright.

It is a subset of the main Bratz line in which all of the dolls are babies. The brand is split into two lines, the regular Bratz Babyz and the Bratz Big Babyz. ==Bratz Babyz== In 2004, the first Bratz Babyz were made. The babyz were \\"Cloe\\", \\"Sasha\\", \\"Jade\\" and \\"Yasmin\\" (the first Bratz.) The dolls came with a changing bag, a nap blanket, bottle on a chain and a pet based on the girl's nickname (e.g. Sasha's nickname is Bunny Boo, so she has a bunny.) Later on, in 2005, \\"Meygan\\", \\"Fianna\\", \\"Cameron\\" and \\"Dana\\" joined the Bratz Babyz group. Also, in 2005, they released the 'Hair Flair' collection. Instead of having plastic hair, the dolls had fiber hair like regular Bratz dolls. ==Bratz Big Babyz== Soon after, they made Bratz Big Babyz; dolls approximately five times the size of regular Babyz dolls. In 2006, the Bratz Big Babyz Bubble Trouble Dolls appeared. These dolls laughed, burped, and blew bubbles when you fed them soda.

Ambler, was a United States Supreme Court landmark case argued in 1926. It was the first significant case regarding the relatively new practice of zoning, and served to substantially bolster zoning ordinances in towns nationwide in the United States and in other countries of the world including Canada. ==Facts== Ambler Realty owned of land in the village of Euclid, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. The village, in an attempt to prevent industrial Cleveland from growing into and subsuming Euclid and prevent the growth of industry which might change the character of the village, developed a zoning ordinance based upon 6 classes of use, 3 classes of height and 4 classes of area. The property in question was divided into three use classes, as well as various height and area classes, thereby hindering Ambler Realty from developing the land for industry. Ambler Realty sued the village, arguing that the zoning ordinance had substantially reduced the value of the land by limiting its use, amounting to a deprivation of Ambler's liberty and property without due process. ==Judgment== ===Lower Court=== In the lower court, the village moved to dismiss the complaint entirely, arguing that Ambler Realty had no right to sue in the first place without taking the issue before the Euclid Zoning Board, as required by the zoning ordinance. Euclid was basing this argument on a legal doctrine which has come to be known as the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court denied this motion. Finding that the zoning ordinance did in fact constitute a taking by Euclid of Ambler's property, the court stated that the ordinance was unconstitutional, being aimed implicitly if not explicitly at preventing \\"the colored or certain foreign races [from] invad[ing] a residential section,\\" i.e. enforcing racial segregation and thus falling afoul of Buchanan v. Warley (1917). Thus there was no reason for the company to abide by the ordinance's requirement. Euclid's motion was denied and the lower court decided in favor of Ambler Realty. Prominent lawyer Newton D. Baker argued the case for Ambler Realty and James Metzenbaum represented Euclid. ===Supreme Court=== The Supreme Court agreed with the lower court's denial of the dismissal motion, but overturned the outcome of the case and sided with the Village of Euclid. The Court held that the zoning ordinance was not an unreasonable extension of the village's police power and did not have the character of arbitrary fiat, and thus it was not unconstitutional. Further, the Court found that Ambler Realty had offered no evidence that the ordinance had any effect on the value of the property in question, but based their assertions of depreciation on speculation only. The court ruled that speculation was not a valid basis for a claim of takings. Ambler Realty had argued their case on the basis of the 14th Amendment's due process clause. The Court noted that the challenger in a due process case would have to show that the law in question is discriminatory and has no rational basis. The Court found that Euclid's zoning ordinance in fact did have a rational basis. Planner and lawyer Alfred Bettman, supported by the Ohio Planning Conference (now APA-Ohio, a chapter of the American Planning Association), submitted a friend of the court brief on behalf of Euclid, arguing that zoning is a form of nuisance control and therefore a reasonable police power measure. In short the court ruled that zoning ordinances, regulations and laws must find their justification in some aspect of police power and asserted for the public welfare. Benefit for the public welfare must be determined in connection with the circumstances, the conditions and the locality of the case. ==Significance== ===Zoning precedent=== At the time of Euclid, zoning was a relatively new concept, and indeed there had been rumblings that it was an unreasonable intrusion into private property rights for a government to restrict how an owner might use property. The court, in finding that there was valid government interest in maintaining the character of a neighborhood and in regulating where certain land uses should occur, allowed for the subsequent explosion in zoning ordinances across the country. The court has never heard a case seeking to overturn Euclid. Today most local governments in the United States have zoning ordinances. The city of Houston, Texas, is the largest unzoned city in the United States.Reinhold, Robert. \\"FOCUS: Houston; A Fresh Approach To Zoning\\". New York Times. Retrieved 2009-03-27. Less than two years later, the Supreme Court decided Nectow v. City of Cambridge (1928). In Nectow, the Court overturned a zoning ordinance for violating the 14th Amendment due process clause. ===Euclid=== The Ambler tract remained undeveloped for 20 years until General Motors built an aircraft plant there during World War II and later a GM Fisher Body plant until the 1970s. On June 9, 2016, the City of Euclid and the Euclid Landmarks Commission dedicated an Ohio Historical Marker at the Euclid Police Mini-Station on HGR Industrial Surplus‚Äô property at 20001 Euclid Avenue, Euclid, Ohio, to formally recognize the site at the center of the U.S. Supreme Court case.Tabasso, Gina. \\"Historical marker erected to dedicate landmark zoning case\\".

Goyder's Line is a line that runs roughly east‚Äìwest across South Australia and, in effect, joins places with an average annual rainfall of . North of Goyder's Line, annual rainfall is usually too low to support cropping, with the land being only suitable for grazing. Related to that, the line also marks a distinct change in vegetation. To the south, it is composed mainly of mallee scrub, whilst saltbush predominates to the north of the line. ==History== Approximation of Goyder's Line within South Australia With barely 30 years' knowledge of this new country, farmers needed reliable information about the climate and growing conditions. In 1865 George Goyder, the then Surveyor-General of the colony, was asked to map the boundary between those areas that received good rainfall and those experiencing drought. After traversing an estimated 3200 km on horseback (not including the Eyre Peninsula) in November 1865, he submitted his report and map to the state government on 6 December. The map included a line of demarcation, the areas north of which being those Goyder judged \\"liable to drought\\", with the areas to the south deemed arable. He discouraged farmers from planting crops north of his line, declaring this land suitable only for light grazing. Goyder's report was based on the information already in his office, supplemented by the observations made during the 1865 journey to observe the effects of drought. He was guided in drawing the line by the changes in vegetation, especially various kinds of saltbush. Ample rains fell in 1865, prompting farmers to ignore Goyder's report and settle in the north, starting farms and planting crops. The idea that rain follows the plough, developed during the contemporaneous westward expansion of cropping in the United States, encouraged this trend. A few years later, many had to abandon their properties. The land was indeed unsuitable for crops, and Goyder was proved correct. Many farmhouse ruins can still be seen in the vicinity of Goyder's line. Goyder's Line was embodied in Schedule 1 of the Waste Lands Alienation Act 1872 which prohibited purchase of land on credit outside of designated agricultural areas. However a few good seasons led to the repeal of that act in 1874. There were other periods of development north of the line but, invariably, adverse conditions proved decisive. Entire towns and farms were abandoned when there was a return to longer-term average rainfall patterns. The line has proven highly accurate, a notable feat given the relatively limited knowledge of the local climate at the time it was surveyed. In December 2015, climate scientist Peter Hayman stated that the current \\"warming, drying trend\\" of South Australia's climate would definitely \\"put a downward shift on Goyder's Line\\" towards the south. ==Location== Detail of memorial cairn near Redhill, South Australia, showing a map of Goyder's Line within the southern portion of South Australia Goyder's Line starts on the west coast near Ceduna and runs south-east across the Eyre Peninsula to strike Spencer Gulf near Arno Bay. It continues from near Moonta north to Crystal Brook and Orroroo, then south-east past Peterborough and Burra to the Victorian border near Pinnaroo, crossing the Murray River south of Blanchetown. Agriculture is possible north of the line near the Murray River, only because of irrigation using water drawn from the river. When flying over the area, the distinct change in flora makes it possible to see the approximate path of Goyder's Line. ==Cultural significance== Goyder's Line became a National Trust of Australia Heritage Icon in 2003. The Goyder Line was also mentioned in the Redgum song \\"Virgin Ground\\" from the 1980 album of the same name, and in the song \\"Spark of the Heart\\", from their 1984 album Frontline. Other states have similar conditions where parts of a state are arable but other parts are suitable only for pastoral grazing; however, no other state has a surveyed line equivalent to Goyder's line. ==See also== *Arid Diagonal (arid and semi-arid belt in South America) *Great Plains (semi- arid area of the United States) *Palliser's Triangle (semi-arid area of Canada) *Semi-arid climate ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * * * Category:Geography of South Australia Category:Regional climate effects Category:Agriculture in South Australia Category:History of South Australia ","title":"Goyder's Line"},{"id":"1433557","text":"Austin Loomer Rand (16 December 1905 ‚Äì 6 November 1982) was a Canadian zoologist. He was born in Kentville, Nova Scotia in 1905 and grew up in nearby Wolfville, where he was mentored by the noted local ornithologist Robie W. Tufts. He received a Bachelor of Science from Acadia University, an institution which also awarded him an honorary DSc degree in 1961. In 1929, while still a graduate student at Cornell University, he travelled on an expedition to Madagascar as collector of birds. Rand published the results as his thesis for his Ph.D..

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the majority opinion of the Court, which effectively overturned Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC,. in which the Court had created a two tiered system for analyzing racial classifications. Adarand held the federal government to the same standards as the state and local governments through a process of \\"reverse incorporation,\\" in which the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause was held to bind the federal government to the same standards as state and local governments are bound under the 14th Amendment. ==Background== At the time this case was litigated, many contracts led by agencies of the United States federal government contained financial incentives for the prime contractor to employ subcontractors that were owned or controlled by \\"socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\\" The US Small Business Administration would certify certain businesses as disadvantaged. That usually meant that the business was owned by racial or ethnic minority groups or by women. In this particular case the contract stated that \\"the contractor shall presume that socially and economically disadvantaged individuals include Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities....\\" In 1989, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) awarded a highway construction contract in Colorado to Mountain Gravel and Construction Company. Mountain Gravel solicited bids for a subcontract for guardrails along the highway. The lowest bid was submitted by Adarand Constructors, with a higher bid being submitted by Gonzales Construction. However, Gonzales Construction had been certified by the Small Business Administration as a disadvantaged business and so Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to Gonzales because of financial incentives in the Mountain Gravel's contract for employing disadvantaged businesses. Adarand filed suit in federal court against DOT by arguing that the subcontracting incentive clause, or bonus, that caused Adarand to lose a subcontract was unconstitutional. The federal district court and circuit court ruled in favor of DOT and against Adarand, which then appealed to the US Supreme Court. The case was docketed as Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Federico Pe√±a, Secretary of Transportation, et al. because Federico Pe√±a was the US Secretary of Transportation at that time. Mountain States Legal Foundation represented Adarand Constructors. The questions before the Court was primarily whether the presumption of disadvantage based on race alone, as well as the consequent allocation of favored treatment, was a discriminatory practice that violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment as well as the Due Process clause of the 5th Amendment. == Subsequent developments == On September 5, 2005, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report finding that, ten years after the Adarand decision, federal agencies still largely fail to comply with the rule in Adarand.U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Federal Procurement After Adarand (September 2005) Specifically, the Commission found that the Departments of Defense, Transportation, United States Department of Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, State, and the Small Business Administration, do not seriously consider race-neutral alternatives before implementing race-conscious federal procurement programs. The Commission found that such consideration is required by the strict scrutiny standard under Adarand and Court decisions. Commissioner Michael Yaki dissented from the Commission's report, arguing that the Commission was taking a \\"radical step backwards\\" from the \\"race-progressive policies\\" of the past. ==References== == External links == * * Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

The debut album A Sign of Sublime was released in February 2010. Her second album, called The Corruption of Mercy, was released on 27 June 2011 under a new three album record deal with Listenable Records. ==Career== Deva was raised in East Ham, London and has two half sisters and three half brothers. She had a troubled and turbulent childhood, leaving home when she was nine years old. Her godmother influenced her life greatly, getting her on the path to music. Deva's career started at the age of eleven at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch, Essex. A cover of Ella Fitzgerald's \\"Summertime\\" was her first performance in a live band and totally unrehearsed, she performed one more time there at the age of thirteen. Deva went on to write her own lyrics and later recorded a demo on her friend's 8-track console. Her first band was called Mad Dog, a punk group in which she was co-vocalist. She only did one show with the band, in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, supporting legendary punk band 999. Paul Allender and Dani Filth, founders of extreme metal band Cradle of Filth, would later meet Deva through mutual friends. After leaving Cradle of Filth in 2009, Deva started her self-titled solo project with Ken Newman and signed a deal with a small British record company. A Sign of Sublime was released on 15 February 2010. A European and UK tour followed inclusive of a performance at Femme Metal Festival.

As leader of the PES, she had a central role in the controversy surrounding the failure to discharge the European Commission (EC)'s 1996 budget, bringing the first motion of censure against the Commission but voting against it. She then changed her position following corruption allegations raised by EC official Paul van Buitenen to call for Jacques Santer (then President of the European Commission) to react promptly or be sacked. Green lost the leadership of the PES in 1999, which was attributed in part to her handling of the incident. Following her re-election as an MEP in 1999, Green announced that she was retiring from politics to take up a position as the first female Chief Executive of Co-operatives UK, a position that she held until 2009. Her work with the organisation included sitting on and responding to the recommendations of the Co-operative Commission, facilitating the organisation's merger with the Industrial Common Ownership Movement (ICOM) and working to \\"secure and celebrate\\" the Co- operative Advantage. In the 2013 Green was appointed as a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) while also holding the office of the President of ICA Europe until her election as President of the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) in November 2009. As with her appointment to Co-operatives UK, she is the first female president in the organisation's history. ==Early life== Green was born Pauline Wiltshire in G≈ºira on the island of Malta to an English soldier serving with the Royal Artillery and his Maltese sweetheart in 1948. The family moved between Malta, Egypt and Germany, following Green's father wherever he was stationed. As a result, Green spent \\"a lot of [her] very young days in army barracks\\" and \\"missed out on secondary and further education\\". Following her father's return to civilian life, the family moved to Kilburn in London when Green was aged fourteen, and ‚Äì acquiescing to her father's wishes that she did something \\"safe and steady\\" ‚Äì Green studied for an Ordinary National Diploma in business studies. She started her career as a secretary with a wallpaper manufacturers, before joining the Metropolitan Police on her 21st birthday. She later said that it was working on the beat and witnessing first hand the cycle of those caught in poverty turning to crime that turned her into a socialist. In 1971, she was working in the West Hampstead division when she met and married PC Paul Green, resigning from the force in 1974 five months before the birth of her first child. Paul Green went on to become Chief Superintendent Green, borough commander for Brent, and was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 1999 New Year's Honours before retiring in 2000. He and Green divorced in 2003. Whilst staying at home to look after her two children (a son and a daughter), Green studied for a degree from the Open University. She then spent two full-time years studying at the LSE for an MSc (Econ) in Comparative Government. She spent two years between 1982 and 1984 as a lecturer at Barnet College of Further Education, before becoming an assistant teacher at a Special Educational Unit. During this period Green was increasing active in local politics, becoming secretary and then chair of the Chipping Barnet Labour Party, before standing in (and losing) the elections for a seat on the area's council in 1986. In 1985, she left her teaching career to become Parliamentary Advisor on European Affairs to the Co-operative Union, a position which she left in 1989 as her political career began. ==Political career== ===Early career=== Due to the changing political landscape, Green found that her job increasingly saw her lobbying to Brussels, with her particular interest being a directive backed by the co-operative movement creating common standards for food hygiene across Europe. In June 1989, she announced her intention to stand for a seat in the European elections to help ensure the adoption of the draft directive. She visited \\"most of the 65 local branches\\" of the constituency of London North and won the seat with a majority of 5,387. She was re-elected to the seat in 1994 with a majority of 48,348. Green was elected Leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) in 1993, beating incumbent leader Glyn Ford. She only served for one year, however, after having been chosen and championed by then Labour leader John Smith to become the new leader of the PES. At the 1994 Party Leaders' Conference in Corfu, a \\"package deal\\" was agreed to fill the upcoming political posts, and it was agreed that Green would take the leadership post with strong backing from the Labour contingent. Green was strongly involved in the fight against Apartheid in South Africa.Nelson Mandela and Co-operative Movements fight apartheid, thenews.coop; accessed 7 April 2016. Ian White, an MEP elected at the same time as Green, said: \\"Although the parliamentary group formally elected Pauline, the \\"deal\\" was put together by the national party leaders. I believe that, had it been an open election, she would have won in any case, hands down, on competence alone.\\" She held the position for five years (1994‚Äì99), and was involved at senior levels of policy making in the European Union and member governments. In 1998 there were rumours that she would stand to be Labour's candidate for Mayor of London. Whilst she expressed an interest in the position, she maintained that she would not be able to commit to the position until after the 1999 leadership elections because of her European commitments. ===Controversies=== Green was seen as a strong advocate of EU parliamentary and institutional reform: she was vocal in her criticisms of any hint of impropriety, for example calling ex-commissioner Martin Bangemann's appointment to Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica \\"sleaze soaked\\" for the impression it gave that he had used his position in the EC for his own advantage ‚Äì even though he had broken no rules. However, her own final year as leader saw its own controversy with allegations of corruption against the EC. One of the Parliament's duties was to discharge the budget, confirming that the year's spending had been in line with the plans originally set by the EC and that the money had been spent honestly and efficiently. However, the parliamentary budget committee decided that it could not fulfill this duty with regard to the 1996 budget until points concerning the reduction of fraud in the transport system had been clarified. For six months, the debate raged, with Green initially supporting the campaign to discharge the budget (whilst calling for more radical change), but only after a group of specialists that included two senior Socialist MEPs announced that there had been a slight improvement. Parties from the centre and the right began to claim that the PES were only supporting their own members, and ultimately the move to discharge the budget was defeated. It was then that Green asserted that the argument would normally be solved in a national democracy by a vote of confidence: since that option did not exist in EU legislation, she instead tabled a motion of censure against the EC. Green explained that \\"One of the fundamental reasons for tabling this motion of censure was to decide now ‚Äì immediately ‚Äì whether or not the European Commission is able to do its work.\\" Because of their belief that the EC should be allowed to continue its reform work, Green and the PES announced that they would be voting against their own motion of censureDebates of the European Parliament: 14 January 1999 ‚Äì effectively trying to defeat a call for the sacking of the EC that they had made.BBC Democracy Live: 14 January 1999: Crisis in the EU As the argument continued, the parliament also refused to discharge the 1997 budget ‚Äì and at the same time, allegations of corruption were made against the French commissioner √âdith Cresson. Commission official Paul van Buitenen accused Cresson of having employed her friend and dentist for eight months as a special advisor on the Environment, at a cost of ¬£30,000. The position was described by sub-contractors in sworn statements as a job \\"for which he is not required to do any work\\". The EC agreed to launch an enquiry in return for the parliament ending its moves to censure the commission. The eventual report found that the allegations were correct, and Green joined those calling for Santer to respond promptly or risk losing his own position. A second censure motion was tabled, but before it was voted on the entire EC resigned ‚Äì although they were still allowed to keep their salaries and jobs as an interim arrangement to electing a new Commission. Green saw the resignation as an opportunity to improve the running of the EU, in particularly the ability of the parliament to veto the appointment of the next head of the Commission. She said: \\"We have to use this opportunity to keep pushing for more openness, more transparency, more public control and accountability in the way Europe is run. We now have a real opportunity to go to the voters in the June elections and prove to them that the European Parliament has done its job and changed the political culture of Brussels once and for all.\\" The EU member governments ‚Äì including Tony Blair‚Äôs ‚Äì were not keen on extending the Parliament's powers, but on May Day the Amsterdam Treaty came into effect, which extended their influence somewhat. The Parliament had the opportunity to vote their approval of new EC head Romano Prodi, and did so 392 votes for to 72 against. However, Green's stock was damaged by the long controversy, with even her friends and supporters considering that her handling of the affair did not come across as a coherent strategy, although one commentator at the time did praise the way she had \\"ridden the Brussels storm with verve and conviction.\\" It was against this background ‚Äì and allegations that she had improperly used her official car that Green dismissed as a \\"cheap jibe\\" that had been blown out of all proportion ‚Äì that Green had to stand for re-election in her London constituency. Green retained her seat in the 1999 European Parliament election with a reduced majority of 26,477. This was typical of the Labour Party's performance, with its share of the vote slipping from 44.24% in 1994 to 28.03% causing a resultant reduction in seats from 62 to 29. The European Socialists also did badly in the elections, and lost their dominance of the Parliament, with the European People's Party becoming the largest group in Parliament. Green was asked by Prime Minister Tony Blair to restand for the Parliamentary Group leadership. However she withdrew when it became clear she faced opposition from Spanish, German and French socialists to allow the brokering of a deal making Robin Cook to become PES president. The following September, she also lost her seat on the Labour National Executive Committee, with the slump in her popularity being largely attributed to her earlier handling of the EC \\"scandal\\" and Labour's poor performance in the European parliamentary elections. In November 1999, Green announced that she would be retiring as an MEP to become the first female chief executive of the Co-operative Union, officially taking up the position on New Year's Day 2000. The decision led to criticism from some quarters, as the mechanics of the electoral system meant that the public would not vote in Green's successor, and instead the next candidate on Labour's list automatically replaced her. Theresa Villiers, a fellow MEP for the Conservatives said Green's \\"resignation demonstrates a total lack of regard for the electorate\\". Green was caught up in further controversy the following year, regarding the list of voters eligible to decide the Labour candidate for the 2000 London Mayor elections. Complaints were made about Green's inclusion on the list despite her resignation as an MEP with her vote reported as being \\"worth a thousand times that of any ordinary member\\". ==Co-operation== Green already had a track record in the UK co-operative movement. As well as her status as a Labour and Co-operative MEP and advisory position with the Co- operative Union, she had been a Woodcraft Folk leader and was made president of the Industrial Common Ownership Movement (ICOM) in 1999. As an MEP, she had also been elected President of the 1997 Co-operative Congress. She was welcomed to the movement by the 2000 Congress President, Pat Wheatley, who described her as \\"someone of great wisdom, true co-operative principles\\" and \\"a shining example of 'courage under fire'\\" for her work with the PES. Holyoake House, head office of Co-operatives UK where Green was Chief ExecutiveWithin two weeks of starting work at the Union, Green sat down with other high-profile members of the co-operative movement and drafted a letter to Tony Blair. The letter ‚Äì signed by Green, Lord Graham of Edmonton, Graham Melmoth, and Len Fyfe ‚Äì called on the Prime Minister to sponsor a commission to review the co-operative movement and determine its future development and modernisation. The letter arrived against a background of the impending merger of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) and Co-operative Retail Services to create the Co-operative Group, as well as recent efforts by entrepreneur Andrew Regan to demutualise the CWS. Blair responded favourably to the request, and pledged his support in setting up a Co-operative Commission. The Commission was officially launched under chair John Monks on 24 February 2000, with Green being invited to serve as one of the 12 commissioners. There was a whispering campaign amongst Labour MPs that the Commission was intended to look at the party's funding relationship with the co-operative movement, which Green dismissed as \\"nonsense.\\" The Commission's final report was published in January 2001, leaving Green to begin the work of co-ordinating the Union's response. The Union began a \\"deliberate attempt to secure and celebrate [the] co-operative advantage\\" by increasing its ties with other organisations across the co-operative movement: they began providing professional and admin services for the United Kingdom Co-operative Council (UKCC) and ICOM, and working with co-operative support organisations across the country to establish the \\"first ever 'all movement' Co-ordination Movement\\". This work continued into 2001, with Green using her joint positions in ICOM and the Union to facilitate a merger of the two organisations, bringing together the worker and consumer co-operative sectors that had existed separately for over 100 years. The membership voted in December 2002 in favour of a change in the Union's name to reflect its new make-up and in January 2003 the organisation was officially relaunched as Co-operatives UK. Green continued to work at \\"driving a culture change in Co-operatives UK\\" ‚Äì for example leading the organisation to become the first co-operative to partner with the National Association of Co-operative Officials (NACO) as its recognised trade union or successfully opposing recommendations from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that would have seen co-operative members' share capital classed as debt, \\"destroying\\" the co-operative advantage. In October 2002, Green was elected as the President of ICA Europe, the umbrella body for European co-operatives. This led in turn to her becoming co-chair of Co- operatives Europe in November 2006, sharing her duties with Etienne Pflimlin. The organisation was formed by ICA Europe and the Co-ordinating Committee of European Co-operative Organisations (CCACE) to \\"work together on issues of importance to co-operatives in Europe\\", following a drive by Green for closer co-operation between the major European co-operative bodies. Green announced that she intended to retire as chief executive of the organisation in 2009, saying: \\"I will be 60 at [that time] and I have always intended to retire when I reached that milestone. The Board [of Co-operatives UK] and I agreed that it made sense for me to finish after Co-operative Congress 2009, which is, to all intents and purposes, the end of our co-operative year.\\" She was succeeded in November 2009 by Ed Mayo. Green was elected Chair of the Board of Supporters Direct following her retirement from Co-operatives UK, and also elected President of the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA). Following her election, she stood down from her position within Co-operatives Europe. She resigned as President of the ICA, two years before her term ended, as the result of The Co-operative Group cutting its financial support for the ICA. ==Honours== In 1988, Green was awarded honorary Doctorates from the University of North London and Middlesex University, and was made Commander of the Order of Honour in 1994 by the President of Greece. She has since been awarded the Grand Golden Cross with Star by the President of the Republic of Austria, and been made Grand Commander of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Cyprus. In the New Year's Honours 2003 Green was appointed as a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) \\"for services to the Co- operative Movement and to the development of the European Union\\" She has been described as \\"strong, confident and well organised\\" by Neil Kinnock, \\"a refreshing no-nonsense figure\\" by Phillip Whitehead and \\"guided by common sense and an antagonism (which amounts almost to contempt) towards the superficialities of political image-making\\" by Roy Hattersley. ==References== ==External links== *Co-operatives UK official site *ICA Europe official site Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (UK) MEPs Category:Co-operative Party politicians Category:Alumni of the Open University Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Commanders of the Order of Honour (Greece) Category:Presidents of Co-operative Congress Category:20th-century women MEPs for England Category:MEPs for England 1989‚Äì1994 Category:MEPs for England 1994‚Äì1999 Category:Labour Co-operative MEPs Category:International opponents of apartheid in South Africa Category:Cooperative advocates ","title":"Pauline Green"},{"id":"1433588","text":"Springfontein is a small mixed farming town in the Free State province of South Africa. ==History== The town was established in 1904 on the farm Hartleydale, which was part of the farm Springfontein. The name Springfontein, which is Afrikaans for \\"jumping fountain\\", stems from the existence of a spring on the farm. A village management board was established in 1904 and the town attained municipal status in 1912. Farming with sheep, cattle and maize is prevalent in the district,Free State Department of Tourism, 'Free State' (pdf), undated 200-?. Accessed via the web. and in the early part of the twentieth century the Springfontein Creameries were one of the main employers.Braby's Orange Free State Directory, 1916 The town is an important railway junction on the main line to Johannesburg, being the point where the Bloemfontein line converges with the East London and Port Elizabeth lines and where a westward line to other Free State towns commences. ==Anglo-Boer War== During the Second Boer War/Anglo-Boer War, there was a British concentration camp in the district. The camp was started in February 1901, initially with an estimated total of 411 inmates being held there. William Gostling, who was a magistrate in Philippolis, was appointed superintendent of the camp. The majority of the inmates that arrived at the camp were bywoners, or poor Boer farm labourers. Many arrivals had little clothing, were barefoot and improvised with what little they had.BCCD. \\"British Concentration Camps of the South African War 1900-1902\\". University of Cape Town Library. Accessed: 31 August 2018 By the end of March the camp in Springfontein took on hundreds more inmates, including a large number of black people, many of whom were from the Thaba‚ÄôNchu district. These inmates were placed in a separate camp. It is reported that the mortality rate was extremely high within the blacks‚Äô concentration camp. During this time, Springfontein struggled to secure a steady supply of water. This was due to the British military base camps that were in constant need of water, and who therefore monopolised the dams initially meant for the Springfield Concentration Camp. The camp was initially built to house only 500 people, but by April 1901 the pressure of the war brought in almost 2000 more people from various military sweeps. This resulted in a shortage of tents for the incoming inmates. As a result, Bethulie camp was established to help ease the pressure experienced by the Springfontein Camp. Five hundred and sixty eight people of all ages are recorded in the Springfontein Grave Register as having died there between April the fourth and the end of 1901.Stanley, Liz. Mourning Become...: Post/Memory and Commemoration of the Concentration Camps of the South African War 1899-1902. Publisher: Manchester University Press, 2006. Their graves can be seen in the concentration camp cemetery. During the war the camp was visited by Emily Hobhouse during her investigations of conditions in the camps. ==The Welsh Hospital in Springfontein== During the war a number of private initiatives were set up to provide medical infrastructure, most notably by a fund acquired through subscriptions from Welsh citizens.Watts, SA (2002). \\"The Anglo Boer War: A Welsh Hospital in South Africa\\". The South African Military History Society. Accessed: 31 August 2018 The Welsh Hospital was founded by Professor Alfred W. Hughes, from Corris. The hospital was initially meant to be stationed in Bloemfontein, but the area was in the grip of a great typhoid outbreak, which was killing the British soldiers stationed there. The hospital was therefore moved to Springfontein, which was also a strategically important railway junction in the southern Free State. The hospital was opened in May 1900, but by the following month many of the key medical personnel started getting ill with dysentery. This created a challenge for the staff as they were also struggling to contain a typhoid break out from the wounded soldiers they were helping. By July of that year, the Welsh hospital in Springfontein was regarded as the best run military hospital during the war, and orders were given for the hospital to relocate its base to Pretoria. It's approximated that the total number of cases treated at the Welsh Hospital amounted to 1107. The hospital's founder, Hughes, died of typhoid he contracted while working at the hospital. ==See also== * Free State * Paul Kruger == References == Category:Populated places in the Kopanong Local Municipality Category:Second Boer War concentration camps Category:Populated places established in 1904 ","title":"Springfontein"},{"id":"1433593","text":"Morley is a fictional brand of cigarettes that has appeared in various television shows, films, and video games that otherwise have no apparent connection to each other. The fictional brand packaging resembles the original packaging of the Marlboro cigarette brand. The name \\"Morley\\" is a play on \\"Marleys\\", a nickname for Marlboro cigarettes. Morleys appear at least as far back as 1960, in Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. There is also a Morley Lights version, in a gold and white package (similar to Marlboro Lights), marked \\"Lights\\".Morley Lights can be seen in The Walking Dead, \\"Consumed\\" (5x06) (Daryl finds a carton of Morley Lights), and in The Strain, \\"The Third Rail\\" (1x11) (Mariela Martinez throws down an empty pack of Morley Lights).

Over the years Sednaoui has redefined his artistic approach to focus on his fine-art and cinematographic projects. New and existing work have been exhibited recently at the MoMA, New York (2015)‚Äì the National September 11 Memorial & Museum (2013‚Äì2015), New York ‚Äì the Brooklyn Museum, New York (2013 ‚Äì the (Barbican Center, London (2014) ‚Äì Le Grand Palais, Paris (2015)‚Äì the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (2014) and in a solo exhibition at the Sam Art Projects Foundation, Paris (2013). St√©phane Sednaoui career started 30 years ago exploring various film and photographic territories. He covered with success the genres of music video, photojournalism, portrait photography and pop culture. As a music video director, he made \\"Give It Away\\" (Red Hot Chili Peppers), \\"Sly\\" (Massive Attack), \\"Mysterious Ways\\" (U2), \\"Big Time Sensuality\\" (Bj√∂rk), \\"Fever\\" (Madonna) and \\"German Bold Italic\\" (Towa Tei feat. Kylie Minogue). As a photojournalist he covered such events as the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the 2001 September 11 attack of the World Trade Center. He has also been a regular contributor to Vogue Italia, Vogue China, Vanity Fair, The New York Times Magazine, Interview and Visionaire as a fashion and portrait photographer. In 2005, Palm Pictures added to Directors Label, its DVD series dedicated to the best music video directors, a retrospective of his work, The Work of Director St√©phane Sednaoui. ==Early career== Although Sednaoui never received formal training as a photographer or director, it was with the support of two major artists, William Klein and Jean-Paul Gaultier that he shaped his artistic approach between the ages of 18 and 22: At 18 he started as a casting director for advertising campaigns before passing in front of the camera to become the face of Jean-Paul Gaultier's brand for two years (1982‚Äì1984). Through this collaboration he modeled for photographers Steven Meisel and Peter Lindbergh, and for artist Andy Warhol and William Klein.bio in www.stephane sednaoui.com site At 21 he was offered by his mentor photographer-director William Klein to be the casting director of the docufiction movie Mode in France (1985). At 22 he was a dancer in the French choreographer R√©gine Chopinot's creation: Le D√©fil√© (1985) for which Jean-Paul Gaultier was collaborating by creating the costumes. The Jean-Paul Gaultier, William Klein and Regine Chopinot collaborations were documented by Sednaoui and have been shown years later: his pictures of Gaultier-Chopinot were exhibited in 2007 at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs of the Louvre and his experience with William Klein was published in 2009 as a portfolio in the French magazine \\"Paradis\\". ==Career== (A presentation of Sednaoui's work in different mediums in chronological order) ===Photographic essays=== Impregnated with the work of his mentors, William Klein, Robert Frank, Bill Brandt and W. Eugene Smith, Sednaoui's first photographic projects were in the form of Photographic essays. It is as a photo essayist that Sednaoui early work was published in art and photo magazines\\"Exp√©riences\\" portfolio in Photo magazine, May 1991 ===Portrait, Pop Culture & Fashion & photography=== Portraiture: Sednaoui's first editorial assignment was at age 21 when he was offered to do portraits for UK Tatler magazine and then for French newspaper Lib√©ration. He has since collaborated with many magazines, among them: Vanity Fair, The New York Times Magazine, Interview and the French newspaper Le Monde. Pop Culture: He then began contributing to pop culture magazine The Face and Annie Flanders' Details publication (initially an underground magazine founded by Annie Flanders) in 1988. There he mixed pop culture with fashion references. In the hand-made decoupage story Fashion Heroes,The Face magazine, January 1990 Sednaoui photographed designers Jean-Paul Gaultier, Azzedine Alaia and Vivienne Westwood, alongside the models of that era, the story was awarded by William Klein and Jean-Paul Goude.The original International Festival of Fashion Photography that occurred from 1989 to 1994 Sednaoui started creating visuals and album covers for artists such as Bj√∂rk, Mick Jagger and Madonna. Fashion: In parallel to his start in Pop Culture, Franca Sozzani gave Sednaoui his first fashion assignment for the Italian magazine Per Lui and later for Vogue Italia. Sednaoui's initial approach of fashion was energetic and sometimes cartoonish like in his Pop Culture images. A more narrative cinematic approach will emerge in 2000 naturally influenced by his years as a music video director. Sednaoui has been a regular contributor to Vogue Italia, French Num√©ro, Vogue China, and Visionaire. ===Photojournalism=== He photographed the Romanian Revolution of 1989 (published in French newspaper Lib√©ration and UK Arena magazine). Ten years later he photographed and filmed the fall of the twin towers on the September 11 attacks and the search and rescue at Ground Zero during the following days (the following weeks a portfolio was published in Talk magazine and was the cover of a special issue of French newspaper Lib√©ration. In September 2011 Time magazine published a complete portfolio on its website). The National September 11 Memorial & Museum has dedicated an entire room to Sednaoui's images. The book Search and Rescue at Ground Zero was published by Kehrer Verlag in 2014. In her foreword Alice M. Greenwald the director of the museum wrote: \\"We are indebted to St√©phane Sednaoui, who felt compelled ‚Äì not as a photographer but as a human being ‚Äì to rush down, that afternoon, to what would soon come to be known as Ground Zero, hoping to volunteer in the search and rescue efforts underway\\". ===Music videos=== After his breakthrough in France with a video for the French rap band NTM (1990), Sednaoui moved to the US where his video for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \\"Give It Away\\" (1991) won an award at the 1992 MTV Video Music Award. Other Sednaoui music videos that were nominated or received MTV Video Music Awards are, \\"Sleep to Dream\\" (Fiona Apple), \\"Mysterious Ways\\" (U2), \\"Today\\" (The Smashing Pumpkins), \\"Big Time Sensuality\\" (Bj√∂rk), \\"7 Seconds\\" (Youssou N'Dour and Neneh Cherry), \\"Queer\\" (Garbage), \\"Hell Is Round the Corner\\" (Tricky), \\"Ironic\\" (Alanis Morissette), \\"Possibly Maybe\\" (Bj√∂rk), \\"GBI: German Bold Italic\\" (Towa Tei featuring Kylie Minogue) and \\"Le Nouveau Western\\" (MC Solaar). His work is documented in The Work of Director Stephane Sednaoui (2005) from the Directors Label series, a collection of DVDs devoted to music video directors, along with Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Anton Corbijn, Jonathan Glazer, Chris Cunningham and Mark Romanek. By end of 2001, excepted on rare occasions, Sednaoui stopped directing music videos. ===Art=== Over the years Sednaoui has redefined his artistic approach to focus on his fine-art and cinematographic projects. New and existing work have been exhibited recently at the MoMA, New York (2015)‚Äì the 9/11 Memorial Museum (2013‚Äì2015), New York ‚Äì the Brooklyn Museum, New York (2013 ‚Äì the Barbican Center, London (2014) ‚Äì Le Grand Palais, Paris (2015)‚Äì the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (2014) and Sam Art Projects Foundation, Paris (2013). ===Acting=== Sednaoui prominent roles are, in G.H.B. (2013) playing opposite Marina Hands, directed by Laetitia Masson; and in Samui Song (2016) playing opposite Laila Boonyasak and Vithaya Pansringarm, directed by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang ==Personal life== His mother was the photographic agent Yannick Morisot and his uncle the jazzman David Earle Johnson. The actress and model Elisa Sednaoui is a cousin. During the 1990s, he was in relationships with singers Bj√∂rk and Kylie Minogue with whom he also collaborated artistically. In October 2001, Laetitia Casta gave birth to their daughter Sahteene. Sednaoui lives in Paris and New York. His Egyptian-born grandfather came from a Melkite Greek Catholic family of Syrian descent. The family finds its roots in the city of Sednaya in Syria, which is where the surname originates from. The Sednaoui family migrated to Egypt at the end of the 19th century and developed successful department stores in Cairo. These were once considered the Middle Eastern counterpart of the famous department stores known in London, Paris and New York. ==Filmography== ===Short films=== *\\"Acqua Natasa\\" (2002) *\\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" (2005) A 10-minute film based on Lou Reed's song \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\". *\\"Army of Me\\" (2005) An animation based on Bj√∂rk's song \\"Army of Me\\". *'Clues: The Mother of My Death\\" (2014) ===Music videos=== ;1990 *\\"Le monde de demain\\" by Supr√™me NTM ;1991 *\\"Kozmik\\" by Ziggy Marley *\\"Give It Away\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers *\\"Mysterious Ways\\" by U2 ;1992 *\\"Breaking the Girl\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers *\\"Sometimes Salvation\\" by The Black Crowes, with as main character Sofia Coppola, (shot over four days in NY, nov 1-3-4-14, 1992) ;1993 *\\"Way of the Wind\\" (version 1) by P.M.

During the Middle Ages and Stuart period, Great Britain had large domestic supplies of timber, especially valuable were the famous British oaks. This timber formed the backbone of many industries such as shipbuilding but not iron smelting which used charcoal derived from the wood of various trees. ==Origins== From before the industrial revolution period the price of timber in England had been increasing as domestic quantities became more difficult to obtain. Many industries thus were forced to change to substitutes. As the industrial revolution progressed coal replaced timber for use as fuel, while brick replaced timber for use in construction. It would be many decades, however, before iron could be used to replace timber in shipbuilding. By the eighteenth century England had not exhausted its supply of suitable domestic hardwood timber but ‚Äì like the Netherlands ‚Äì it imported softwood supplies. While every nation has trees and wood, ship timber is a far more limited product. The ideal woods were oak, Scots pine ‚Äì but not spruce, and other large trees. Especially difficult to find were trees suitable to be masts, a crucial requirement for any sailing ship, and one that often had to be replaced after storms or wear. As suitable trees take decades to grow, in densely populated nations like England any given square meter of land could, usually, be far more valuably employed by producing foodstuffs rather than timber. Timber was thus only viable industry in sparsely populated lands such as Scandinavia, those in the Baltic Sea area, and in North America. The Baltic countries, and especially Norway, had other benefits including superior sawmills, and often lower transport prices than distant overland travel. The British shipping industry, by the late seventeenth century, increasingly used imports of Baltic timber. ==Concerns over the timber trade== The importation of timber from the Baltic had two notable defects in the mind of British statesmen. The first was one of economics. The British had a large trade deficit with the entire Baltic region. Great Britain required a large number of essential resources from the Baltic, but did not have enough goods to export to the Baltic to make up for these purchases. Thus the shortfall had to be made up in bullion exports. This imbalance caused great displeasure among the mercantilist economists of the day. Further compounding the problem was that unlike other areas where the British had a trade deficit, such as India, the Baltic trade could not be justified on the grounds that Great Britain gained in the end from re-export to the continent, Baltic goods were overwhelmingly used in Britain. Most during the later half of the seventeenth century regarded the Baltic trade as a regrettable, but necessary expenditure for the defence of the land. Some consolation was, however, provided to the mercantilists by the employment of the timber in the merchant fleet that would later assist in bringing bullion into the land. Also of concern was the foreign domination of the Baltic timber trade. This problem was only partially solved by the inclusion of timber in the Navigation Acts of 1651 and 1660. While the acts successfully excluded the Dutch from Britain's trade with the Baltic, it still allowed the Baltic countries the right to import their own timber. It was mostly the Danes, Swedes, and Germans who replaced the Dutch in this trade as British merchants did not see it as profitable enough. This was because the Baltic trade was a difficult one to profit from as one load of British manufactured goods could buy seventy loads of timber, most ships entering the Baltic were thus empty, a great inefficiency. Most British merchants could employ their ships in more profitable colonial and manufactured goods trades, an option that the Baltic merchants did not have. These commercial problems of Baltic timber imports were compounded by a military and strategic problem. The dependency on Baltic timber was paramount in the minds of British statesmen in the late seventeenth century mostly because of the strategic dangers. There were no trades as militarily important as the Baltic lumber trade, but there were also few more fragile. Besides the trade coming from Norway, the timber ships had to come through the Sound ‚Äì the narrow straits separating Denmark from Sweden- a passage easily blocked by enemy navies, especially the Dutch who were geographically well placed to impede trade through the North Sea, as could, to a lesser extent, the French. Also threatening was the rise of Sweden who by 1690 was at the height of its brief period of being a global power. Sweden also was a strong trade protectionist and had imposed high duties of British imports. Sweden's empire was also expanding having seized Livonia as well as Pomerania, both important sources of timber. Thus beginning with the Anglo- Dutch wars of the later seventeenth century British statesmen and merchants began to look for some alternative to these imports. Despite commercial clamouring for regulation of the Baltic timber trade, Josiah Child, for instance, thought the trade should be limited to only British vessels, no actions were taken until 1704 when British security was threatened. The great threat to Britain's security occurred during the War of the Spanish Succession, what some have termed the first global conflict. Only then did the British parliament attempt to break Britain's dependence upon Baltic timber. The only viable alternative to the Baltic areas was North America, New England especially had vast amounts of suitable timber. The great disadvantages were a lack of infrastructure in the colonies and much higher transport costs to British markets. Beginning in 1704 a number of initiatives were launched to try to encourage the use of colonial timber over that from the Baltic. These encouragements included bounties from North American producers, and rules forbidding the export of colonial timber to anywhere other than England. These efforts were quite unsuccessful, however, and both the navy and the merchant fleets remained dependent upon Baltic timber. Baltic timber still remained about a third the price of timber from North America. After the War of the Spanish succession ended the threat to British timber supplies receded, and despite the continuation of strong mercantilist pressure to increase the protectionism this was not done for the next century.this increased the opportunities for jobs in British North America (B.N.A). Over the entire eighteenth century Britain's naval supremacy in the North Sea area was never questioned. However, Britain's commercial position remained unfavourable. With only occasional exceptions Britain was still in constant trade deficit with the entire Baltic region. Despite this condition being viewed as harmful by the economists of the day no action of any significance was taken to try to prevent it. While the laws of Queen Anne's era remained in place, these were well known to be totally ineffective in curbing the dependence on the Baltic. During this period more economic disadvantages of the trade also developed. The American colonies still could exported little timber to England, only great masts could justify the cost of the long transatlantic journey. Thus New England, rather than producing timber and naval stores for the motherland was instead building its own ships that were cheaper and often of superior quality to those produced in Britain. This further violated important tenets of mercantilism and the old colonial system which considered manufacturing in the colonies to be counter Britain interests. Parliament, however, failed to be swayed by shipwrights, merchants or colonial timber producers who were hoping for an end to Baltic competition. It would again take pressure from the navy to introduce mercantilist policies. ==Trade restrictions== The next attempt to break Britain's dependence on the Baltic once again occurred during a great Europe wide conflict that had significant naval elements. The Napoleonic Wars reopened Britain's fears of the Baltic timber trade being severed. Denmark and the straits, like all of continental Europe, were at the mercy of Napoleon's army and many of the rest of the timber ports within the Baltic were threatened by Napoleon's Continental system. The government thus made a more concerted attempt than ever before to break Britain's dependence upon Baltic timber. Throughout the period commencing in 1795 tariffs on foreign timber imports steadily rose. Eventually in 1807 a 275% levy was placed upon all Baltic timber imports to Britain. This levy succeeded in making Canadian timber more cost effective than that from the Baltic. Canadian timber exports to Britain more than tripled from 27,000 loads in 1807 to 90,000 loads in 1809. The sheer bulk of timber and its many requirements soon led the transatlantic timber trade to become Britain's largest employing a quarter of Britain's merchant tonnage. The previous large Baltic trade almost vanished with European wood being used only for luxury items. After peace had returned to Britain the timber tariffs did not have long to survive. While at first they were continued, and even strengthened, by 1820 timber became one of the first areas for free trade theory to be applied. In part this was caused by the continued existence of powerful merchants who wanted to see the old Baltic trade restored. The trading interests with the colonies were even stronger, however. The much longer voyage from British North America to Britain meant far more ships and seamen had to be employed. The longer route not only meant more business, but it also was a more profitable route for British merchants, especially since foreigners were still excluded by the Navigation Acts. Military sources, however, disliked Canadian timber. The longer voyage lowered its quality and it was far more susceptible to the dry rot that was one of the navy's more implacable foes. A frigate made of colonial wood tended to have only half the life span of a Baltic ship. Because of timber's great importance, in 1820 a committee of the House of Lords was formed to review the state of the timber trade. Led by Lord Lansdowne the committee strongly supported the reduction of the duties. This has been viewed as one of the first successes of free trade ideology in Britain. The duties were not eliminated, but they were brought to a level that left Baltic wood competitive with that from Canada. These reductions were a rare example of laissez-faire in an era still almost totally committed to mercantilism. The post-war era also saw a great unwillingness to enforce the duties that were in place. Rampant smuggling of timber into and out of Norway was mostly ignored, as were the illegal exports of bullion to fund the trade. In 1824 the duties were further lowered when Britain began to sign reciprocity treaties with other powers. Out of the first ten bilateral trade treaties signed, seven of them were with Baltic nations covering all the major timber exporters except for Russia. These quick reversals of Baltic trade policy in an era before free trade was paramount can almost certainly be attributed to the navy's unwillingness to become reliant on Canadian timber now that trade with the Baltic had been unquestionably secured. In seeking the exploit of further timber resources was one of the reasons of the First and the Second Anglo- Burmese War (1824‚Äì1826 and 1852, respectively). Burma had to cede Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan) and Tanintharyi (Tenessarim) and later the remaining coastal provinces: Ayeyarwady, Yangon and Bago. During the following years timber was harvested introducing new techniques. The British cut the bark off the trees and left them to dry before felling them roughly four years later with the use of elephants. Dry wood was easier to fell and floated in water and therefore the river Irrawady was used for transporting the wood to the saw mills near Rangoon. Other sources were the wood from Australia which included Jarrah and Karri wood. Some streets in London are still paved with Karri wood from the southern parts of Western Australia. But Jarrah wood is more resistant to water and therefore more valuable then Karri in the constructions of ships. ==References== *Knight, R.J.B.

The regulation is found under Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 230, Sections 501 through 508. The legal citation is 17 C.F.R. ¬ß230.501 et seq. On July 10, 2013, the SEC issued new final regulations allowing public advertising and solicitation of Regulation D offers to accredited investors.https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2013/2013-124-item1.htm ==Overview== Reg D is composed of various rules prescribing the qualifications needed to meet exemptions from registration requirements for the issuance of securities. Rule 501 of Reg D contains definitions that apply to the rest of Reg D. Rule 502 contains the general conditions that must be met to take advantage of the exemptions under Regulation D. Generally speaking, these conditions are (1) that all sales within a certain time period that are part of the same Reg D offering must be \\"integrated\\", meaning they must be treated as one offering, (2) information and disclosures must be provided, (3) there must be no \\"general solicitation\\", and (4) that the securities being sold contain restrictions on their resale. Rule 503 requires issuers to file a Form D with the SEC when they make an offering under Regulation D. In Rules 504 and 505, Regulation D implements ¬ß3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (also referred to as the '33 Act), which allows the SEC to exempt issuances of under $5,000,000 from registration. It also provides (in Rule 506) a \\"safe harbor\\" under ¬ß4(a)(2) of the '33 Act (which says that non-public offerings are exempt from the registration requirement). In other words, if an issuer complies with the requirements of Rule 506, it can be assured that its offering is \\"non-public,\\" and thus that it is exempt from registration. Rule 507 penalizes issuers who do not file the Form D, as required by Rule 503. Rule 508 provides the guidelines under which the SEC enforces Regulation D against issuers. ==Exemptions== Regulation D establishes three exemptions from Securities Act registration. ===Rule 504=== Rule 504 provides an exemption for the offer and sale of up to $5,000,000 of securities in a 12-month period.https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer-small- entity-compliance.html The company may use this exemption so long as it is not a blank check company and is not subject to Exchange Act of 1934 reporting requirements. General offering and solicitations are permitted under Rule 504 as long as they are restricted to accredited investors. The issuer need not restrict purchaser's right to resell securities. Rule 504 allows companies to sell securities that are not restricted if one of the following conditions is met: *The offering is registered exclusively in one or more states that require a publicly filed registration statement and delivery of a substantive disclosure document to investors; *The registration and sale takes place in a state that requires registration and disclosure delivery, and the buyer is in a state without those requirements, so long as the disclosure documents mandated by the state in which you registered to all purchasers are delivered; or *The securities are sold exclusively according to state law exemptions that permit general solicitation and advertising and you are selling only to accredited investors. However, accredited investors are only needed when sold exclusively with state law exemptions on solicitation. ===Rule 505=== On October 26, 2016, the Commission repealed Rule 505.https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-226.html It previously provided an exemption for offers and sales of securities totaling up to $5 million in any 12-month period. Under this exemption, securities could be sold to an unlimited number of \\"accredited investors\\" and up to 35 \\"unaccredited investors\\".https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-226.html The Rule 505 exemption was phased out and its provisions integrated into the Rule 504 exemption. Rule 504's capital limit increased to $5 million and Rule 505's \\"Bad Actor\\" provision was added to Rule 504.https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-226.htmlhttps://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer- small-entity-compliance.html#_ftn2 ===Rule 506=== A company that satisfies the following standards may qualify for an exemption under this rule: *Can raise an unlimited amount of capital; *Seller must be available to answer questions by prospective purchasers; * Financial statement requirements as for Rule 505; and * Purchasers receive restricted securities, which may not be freely traded in the secondary market after the offering. The rule is split into two options based on whether the issuer will engage in general solicitation or advertising to market the securities. If the issuer will not use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities then the sale of securities can be issued under Rule 506(b) to an unlimited number of accredited investors and up to 35 other purchasers. Unlike Rule 505, all non-accredited investors, either alone or with a purchaser representative, must be sophisticated ‚Äì that is, they must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment. In July 2013, the SEC issued new regulations as required by 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2013/2013-124-item1.htm These new regulations add Rule 506(c) to allow general solicitation and advertising for a private placement offering. However, in a Rule 506(c) private offering all of the purchasers must be accredited investors and the issuer must take reasonable steps to determine that the purchaser is an accredited investor.FACT SHEET: Eliminating the Prohibition on General Solicitation and General Advertising in Certain Offerings https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2013/2013-124-item1.htm ===Accredited investor exemption=== Section 4(a)(5) of the '33 Act exempts from registration offers and sales of securities to accredited investors when the total offering price is less than $5 million and no public solicitation or advertising is made. However, Regulation D does not address the offering of securities under this section of the '33 Act. This definition is also used in defining the size of investment allowed under Regulation A. ==Other countries== In Canada, comparables to Reg D securities are termed exempt market securities and fall under National Instrument 45-106. ==References== ==External links== *United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‚Äì Official site *Introduction to the Federal Securities Laws *Introduction to Private Placements *State Securities Law Administrators Category:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Category:Hedge funds Category:United States securities law ","title":"Regulation D (SEC)"},{"id":"1433634","text":"Clifford Chance LLP is a multinational law firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom, and a member of the \\"Magic Circle\\". It is one of the ten largest law firms in the world measured both by number of lawyers and revenue. In 2019/20, Clifford Chance had total revenues of ¬£1.803 billion, the highest of any firm in the Magic Circle, and profits per equity partner of ¬£1.69 million. According to Acuris, as of 2020 Clifford Chance secured the most European M&A; mandates, becoming the most popular adviser to top-tier private equity clients in the continent. In the same year it was named International Law Firm of the Year at the International Financial Law Review (IFLR) Europe Awards, part of the Euromoney group. ==History== 10 Upper Bank Street, Clifford Chance's headquarters in Canary Wharf, London Clifford Chance was formed by the merger of two London-based law firms. The first was Coward Chance, which derived from a firm established in 1802 by Anthony Brown, a fishmonger's son. Brown's firm became embroiled in the Panic of 1825, caused by speculation in South American investments, including the non-existent country of Poyais, invented by Scottish soldier Gregor MacGregor. One of the firm's longest clients was Cecil Rhodes. The firm advised him on his diamond mining business in South Africa, administered his estate after his death and helped set up the Rhodes Scholarships. Another client was Guglielmo Marconi. It also helped Midland Bank recover assets in Russia after the 1917 revolution, and advised the state government of Hyderabad on the preparation for Indian independence. The second firm was Clifford Turner, founded in 1900 by Harry Clifford Turner, with offices on Gresham Street, EC2. Its clients included Dunlop Rubber Company and Imperial Airways. In 1929, Clifford Turner advised and witnessed the creation of John Lewis Partnership. After the Second World War it advised the Labour government on the nationalisation of several privately owned industries. It opened offices in Paris in 1961, Amsterdam in 1972 and New York in 1986.See J Slinn, Clifford Chance: Its origins and development (1993), partially summarised by A brief history of Clifford Chance The merger of Clifford Turner and Coward Chance in 1987 led to the formation of Clifford Chance. Neither Clifford Turner nor Coward Chance were first-rank London law firms, but their merger has since been said to have changed the shape and profile of law firms in London and globally. Over the next decade the firm expanded its practices across Europe and Asia and more than doubled in size. In 1992 Clifford Chance became the first major non-US firm to practice US law. In 1999, Clifford Chance merged with Frankfurt-based law firm P√ºnder, Volhard, Weber & Axster and with the 1871-established US-based firm Rogers & Wells (the use of the P√ºnder, Volhard, Weber & Axster and Rogers & Wells branding for their respective European and United States regional offices was discontinued in 2003). In 2002, Clifford Chance launched in California, setting up a branch with nearly 50 attorneys from the disbanding dot-com firm Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in Los Angeles, Palo Alto, San Diego and San Francisco. With California's downturn, the firm closed its Pacific Coast operations in 2007.Eric Young, \\"Giant UK firm to quit West Coast\\", San Francisco Business Times, 2 May 2007. http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/03/05/story8.html Clifford Chance was one of several international law firms that developed local law practices in Japan following the easing of restrictions on foreign law firms in 2005. Although its Magic Circle competitors Allen & Overy and Linklaters significantly downsized this segment of their practice following the 2008 financial crisis, the Tokyo office of Clifford Chance maintains a local law practice, even handling local matters for Japanese clients, and views this capability as critical for an international law firm. Clifford Chance was the highest-ranked European law firm by Japanese corporate legal departments in a December 2013 Nihon Keizai Shimbun survey. Like other firms in the Magic Circle, the firm lost significant revenue during the late-2000s recession, with its profit dropping by 33.4% in the 2008-9 financial year. As part of cost cutting in response to the recession, in 2009 Clifford Chance announced plans to lay off 80 lawyers and 115 support staff in London.http://www.thelawyer.com/clifford-chance-to-cut-115-london-support- staff-jobs/136978.article In addition, the firm accepted the redundancy applications of 50 fee earners in London over and above the initial 80 lawyers.http://www.thelawyer.com/fifty-take-voluntary-redundancy-at-clifford- chance/136827.articleIn 2011, the firm moved back office tasks to its 350-employee Global Shared Service Centre, including a 60-employee Knowledge Centre in New Delhi, India as an efficiency measure.Mark Ford (Director of the Clifford Chance Knowledge Centre): Clifford Chance's knowledge centre in India: the story so far, Practical Law Company, 28 April 2011, http://plc.practicallaw.com/8-505-7501 In May 2011, Clifford Chance opened offices in Australia by merging with two M&A; boutique law firms, Sydney-based Chang, Pistilli & Simmons and Perth-based Cochrane Lishman Carson Luscombe. In February 2012, Clifford Chance opened a new office in Casablanca, giving the firm's Africa practice its first permanent on the ground presence in the continent. In July 2012, Clifford Chance became the first UK firm to receive permission from South Korea's Ministry of Justice to open an office in the country. In November 2011 it was identified as the largest supplier to the City of London Corporation, having received over ¬£9m in fees from the corporation between January and September of that year. In February 2018, following the January 2018 liquidation of construction and services business Carillion, around 60 staff at Carillion's Newcastle-based legal services arm joined Clifford Chance. On 2 May 2018, Clifford Chance announced the establishment of a delivery and innovation hub in Singapore to serve the Asia- Pacific Region. == Offices == The firm maintains offices in the following cities: * London (global headquarters) * Abu Dhabi * Amsterdam * Barcelona * Beijing * Brussels * Bucharest * Casablanca * Dubai * D√ºsseldorf * Eschborn * Frankfurt * Hong Kong * Istanbul * Luxembourg * Madrid * Milan * Moscow * Munich * Newcastle upon Tyne * New Delhi * New York * Paris * Perth * Prague * Rome * S√£o Paulo * Seoul * Shanghai * Singapore * Sydney * Tokyo * Warsaw * Washington, D.C. ==See also== *List of largest law firms by profits per partner ==References== ==Further reading== *Scott, John (1980).

Sasolburg is further sub-divided into three areas: Sasolburg proper, Vaalpark (a more affluent cluster of suburbs located about 5 km north of the Sasolburg CBD) and Zamdela (a township). Most white residents of Sasolburg speak Afrikaans as a first language, while most black people speak Sesotho as a first language. The Sasol corporation has sponsored infrastructural developments in Sasolburg, such as an Olympic size swimming pool. ==History== The town was established in 1954 to provide housing and other facilities for Sasol employees. The initial installation (Sasol 1) was a pilot plant to refine oil from coal, due to the lack of petroleum reserves. The coal reserves of the country were and still are extensive. The political developments of the late 1960s and early 1970s (specifically the trade embargoes against the apartheid government) made the operation of the pilot plant a priority to the government. Plans were made for a production plant to be built in the Eastern Transvaal to produce approximately 25% of the national fuel requirements. The new town of Secunda was built to house the construction and operations staff of what became known as SASOL 2 and SASOL 3 (Secunda CTL). Sasol One was one of the first places to be designated as a National Key Point under the National Key Points Act, which legislation protected areas so designated from \\"loss, damage, disruption or immobilisation (that) may prejudice the Republic\\". === Bombing === On 2 June 1980, Sasolburg was attacked by Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the African National Congress's (ANC) military wing. They bombed two strategically important SASOL (oil-from-coal) plants and an oil refinery. This event was depicted in the 2006 film Catch a Fire. Kader Asmal, founder of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement, claimed in his memoirs, Politics in my Blood, that the ANC had recruited volunteers from the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) to do reconnaissance on the refinery. The attack proved to be largely ineffectual in terms of sabotaging the manufacturing processes of the Sasol plant. However the propaganda impact of the attack was significant: the South African government presented the event as the result of a foreign, communist onslaught against South Africa, and not a domestic reaction to the country's racial policies. Police Minister Louis le Grange claimed that the then-exiled Joe Slovo, of the banned South African Communist Party, was a key figure. Newspapers that supported the ruling National Party claimed that, in fact, Muammar Qaddafi had masterminded the sabotage, and that Russians had been training terrorists in Libya. === October 1987 strike === On 1 October 1987, Sasol 1's management called in police and vigilantes to break up a workers‚Äô strike resulting from a wage dispute. Over the following weeks, 77 workers died, and the 2 400 jobs were retrenched without their due compensation. The ex-workers took SASOL to court as result and, in 1989, the Labour Court ruled in favour of the ex-workers; however, as of 2014, they have yet to receive compensation. SASOL still denies responsibility and, as a result of the refinery's designation as a National Key Point, the actions taken against workers remain secret until today. === Demarcation riots === In January 2013, residents of Sasolburg's Zamdela township rioted in response to a demarcation proposal to incorporate Sasolburg into the neighbouring Parys's Ngwathe municipality, believing that the merge would result in poorer service delivery and increased corruption. Police were unable to stop the violence, which involved assault, vandalism, and plundering, as they were outnumbered. ==Geography== Sasolburg is at a high altitude with a fairly dry climate and large seasonal temperature variation. It is situated on the banks of the Vaal River, which separates the Free State from the former Transvaal Province, and is not far from the Vaal Dam where excellent windsurfing spots can be found. ==Government== Fezile Dabi District Municipality and Metsimaholo Local Municipality seat's at this Northern Free State town. ==References== ==External links== *Official site *Vaal Triangle Info *Fighting for scraps in the Republic of Sasol(burg), Stephen Sparks, Mail & Guardian, 21 January 2013 Category:1954 establishments in South Africa Category:Populated places in the Metsimaholo Local Municipality Category:Populated places established in 1954 ","title":"Sasolburg"},{"id":"1433645","text":"Witton Country Park is a 480-acre (1.9 km¬≤) public park in the west of Blackburn, Lancashire, England.

Shattering and VC-theory are used in the study of empirical processes as well as in statistical computational learning theory. ==Definition== Suppose A is a set and C is a class of sets. The class C shatters the set A if for each subset a of A, there is some element c of C such that : a = c \\\\cap A. Equivalently, C shatters A when their intersection is equal to A's power set: P(A) = { c ‚à© A  c ‚àà C }. We employ the letter C to refer to a \\"class\\" or \\"collection\\" of sets, as in a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class (VC-class). The set A is often assumed to be finite because, in empirical processes, we are interested in the shattering of finite sets of data points. ==Example== We will show that the class of all discs in the plane (two- dimensional space) does not shatter every set of four points on the unit circle, yet the class of all convex sets in the plane does shatter every finite set of points on the unit circle. Let A be a set of four points on the unit circle and let C be the class of all discs. The set A of four particular points on the unit circle (the unit circle is shown in purple). To test where C shatters A, we attempt to draw a disc around every subset of points in A. First, we draw a disc around the subsets of each isolated point. Next, we try to draw a disc around every subset of point pairs. This turns out to be doable for adjacent points, but impossible for points on opposite sides of the circle. As visualized below: Image:shattering02.pngEach individual point can be isolated with a disc (showing all four). Image:shattering03.pngEach subset of adjacent points can be isolated with a disc (showing one of four). Image:shattering04.pngA subset of points on opposite sides of the unit circle can not be isolated with a disc. Because there is some subset which can not be isolated by any disc in C, we conclude then that A is not shattered by C. And, with a bit of thought, we can prove that no set of four points is shattered by this C. However, if we redefine C to be the class of all elliptical discs, we find that we can still isolate all the subsets from above, as well as the points that were formerly problematic. Thus, this specific set of 4 points is shattered by the class of elliptical discs. Visualized below: Image:shattering05.pngOpposite points of A are now separable by some ellipse (showing one of two) Image:shattering06.pngEach subset of three points in A is also separable by some ellipse (showing one of four) With a bit of thought, we could generalize that any set of finite points on a unit circle could be shattered by the class of all convex sets (visualize connecting the dots). ==Shatter coefficient== To quantify the richness of a collection C of sets, we use the concept of shattering coefficients (also known as the growth function). For a collection C of sets s \\\\subset \\\\Omega, \\\\Omega being any space, often a sample space, we define the nth shattering coefficient of C as : S_C(n) = \\\\max_{\\\\forall x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n \\\\in \\\\Omega } \\\\operatorname{card} \\\\\\\\{\\\\,\\\\\\\\{\\\\,x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}\\\\cap s, s\\\\in C \\\\\\\\} where \\\\operatorname{card} denotes the cardinality of the set and x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n \\\\in \\\\Omega is any set of n points,. S_C(n) is the largest number of subsets of any set A of n points that can be formed by intersecting A with the sets in collection C. Here are some facts about S_C(n): # S_C(n)\\\\leq 2^n for all n because \\\\\\\\{s\\\\cap As\\\\in C\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq P(A) for any A\\\\subseteq \\\\Omega. # If S_C(n)=2^n, that means there is a set of cardinality n, which can be shattered by C. # If S_C(N)<2^N for some N>1 then S_C(n)<2^n for all n\\\\geq N. The third property means that if C cannot shatter any set of cardinality N then it can not shatter sets of larger cardinalities. ==Vapnik- Chervonenkis class== The VC dimension of a class C is defined as :VC(C)=\\\\underset{n}{\\\\min}\\\\\\\\{n:S_C(n)<2^n\\\\\\\\}\\\\, or, alternatively, as :VC_0(C)=\\\\underset{n}{\\\\max}\\\\\\\\{n:S_C(n)=2^n\\\\\\\\}.\\\\, Note that VC(C)=VC_0(C)+1. If for any n there is a set of cardinality n which can be shattered by C, then S_C(n)=2^n for all n and the VC dimension of this class C is infinite. A class with finite VC dimension is called a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class or VC class. A class C is uniformly Glivenko-Cantelli if and only if it is a VC class. ==See also== *Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma, relating the cardinality of a family of sets to the size of its largest shattered set ==References== *. * *. ==External links== *Origin of \\"Shattered sets\\" terminology, by J.

It was founded in 1882 on the two farms Pearson Valley and Grootdraai owned by Lourens de Villiers. ==Location== The town is located in the north-eastern Free State, in the eastern half of South Africa. It actually lies at the border of the province of Mpumalanga, with the Vaal River forming the border. Nearby towns include (and their distance in km): *Warden (98 km) *Heidelberg (60 km) *Frankfort (33 km) *Cornelia (30 km) *Vrede (61 km) Villiers is also located roughly 150 km from Pretoria (South Africa's de facto capital city), and approximately 70 km from the city of Vereeniging. ==History== The town of Villiers is named after Lourens de Villiers on whose farms the town was first built. The town was established at the Vaal River crossing on the very important transport route between Durban and Johannesburg. De Villiers started with the subdivision of his farms into erven in 1882 and the town was proclaimed by State President F.W. Reitz on 29 May 1891. In these early days the Vaal River was the important boundary between the then Orange Free State and the then Transvaal Republic. Both Governments erected toll houses on the banks of the Vaal River at the Villiers wagon crossing points, at the site of the current steel bridge. These toll houses remained in force until the creation of the Union of South Africa on 31 May 1910. In the early days during typical Highveld thunderstorms and in the rainy season there were sometimes up to 300 wagons waiting to cross the Vaal river at the Villiers crossing. The postal service also used this route from Harrismith, Dundas, to Villiers, Malanskraal, Heidelberg and then to the goldfields of the Witwatersrand. The Van der Berg park was used by the postal service to get ‚Äúfresh‚Äù horses for their wagons. This park was also later used as a marketplace. Villiers is steeped in history with buildings and structures dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. There are some prime restored examples of Eastern Free-state sandstone architecture and a beautiful church at the centre of town with high pitched slate roof. ==Activities== Town activities include: *Eastern Free- state Sandston Architecture; *Village strolls through streets of Villiers; *Villiers Holiday Resort; *Walking routes through town and sites of interest; *Horse riding; *Quad bike route on neighbouring farms; *A school with personal attention and boarding facilities; *Guesthouse, coffee shops and pubs. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Mafube Local Municipality Category:Populated places founded by Afrikaners Category:Populated places established in 1891 Category:1891 establishments in South Africa ","title":"Villiers, Free State"},{"id":"1433667","text":"E36 may refer to: * Nimzo-Indian Defence, Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings code * The BMW E36 automobile platform * The European route E36 connecting Berlin to Boles≈Çawiec * The Federal Aviation Administration airport code of Georgetown Airport (California) * Cryotech E36, a Potassium acetate based runway deicer * Penang Bridge, route E36 in Malaysia ","title":"E36"},{"id":"1433672","text":"Vredefort is a small farming town in the Free State province of South Africa that used to farm with cattle, peanuts, sorghum, sunflowers and maize.

It stars Kylie Minogue (in her feature film debut) and Charlie Schlatter as the main characters Lola and Brownie, and was filmed in Brisbane, Maryborough and Bundaberg, Queensland. The film was released in Australia on 21 December 1989 to mixed reviews from critics. It grossed $3,370,650 at the box office in Australia.Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office An accompanying soundtrack was also released. The film was also released internationally, including the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, and West Germany. ==Plot== Lola and Brownie are teenagers in the city of Bundaberg during the 1950s. They fall in love, but because of their age must fight their parents and welfare, who try to keep them apart. Lola falls pregnant and the couple runs away so they can keep their baby and live happily ever after. Lola's mother and the police find them and take Lola home. Brownie joins the crew of a ship so he can sail the coast and look for Lola. Meanwhile, Lola is forced to have an abortion by her mother in Brisbane. After an argument with her mother about Brownie and the abortion, Lola moves to Melbourne, becomes a waitress and bleaches her hair. Lola is reunited with Brownie after he visits the bar where Lola works whilst on shore leave. She returns with Brownie to his ship and they spend the night together in Brownie's cabin, where they are discovered the following morning by Brownie's friend and boss, Bosun. After an argument between Brownie and Bosun as to whether Lola should return to her mother or stay with Brownie, Bosun eventually relents and says that Lola can stay, so long as she is kept \\"out of sight\\" from the other sailors. After the ship docks, Lola and Brownie attend a party held by a young couple, Lyle and Mavis. They are squatting in the property with their daughter, Sharon. One night, Lola and Brownie are arrested for underage drinking after being caught leaving a pub. Lola is taken away by her mother and welfare to live with Aunt Westbury, a caretaker in the countryside for a fixed-term of 12 months. She and Brownie are told that they are not allowed to see or contact each other for one year. During Lola's stay in the community placement, a former charge of Aunt's visits the house. During this visit, Lola collects the mail and, after a brief conversation with the postman, realizes that her caretaker has thrown all Brownie's letters in the bin. Lola and the caretaker fight, and Lola runs away. Finding her mother drunk and unsympathetic, Lola returns to Lyle and Sharon's home, only to be arrested and taken to a young offenders' institution to restart and complete her sentence. During this time, a riot is started by the other inmates. After her 18th birthday, Lola is released from jail and is subsequently reunited with Brownie. They return to the house, where Lola discovers that Mavis is heavily pregnant with her and Lyle's second child. Lola wants Brownie to quit his job as a sailor, and stay with her; however, Brownie is unsure and confides in Bosun about his dilemma. Mavis goes into labor. The birth does not go well and both Mavis and the baby die. Although Lola and Brownie offer to adopt Mavis' surviving daughter, they are unable to as they are unmarried. Lyle leaves the child with Lola to give to social services as she will be placed into foster care and Lyle is unable to bear the thought of giving up his only child. Lyle subsequently leaves after telling Lola he intends to travel the world and taking on odd jobs to make ends meet while stopping off at different locations on his travels. He also tells Lola that he is too devastated by recent events to remarry or have another family. En route to the welfare office, Brownie sees Lola and Sharon in the taxi and runs after them. Eventually, Brownie catches up with the taxi and he is reunited with Lola and Sharon. The film ends with their wedding with their families and friends in attendance. ==Cast== * Kylie Minogue as Lola Lovell * Charlie Schlatter as Brownie Hansen * Bruno Lawrence as Bosun * Todd Boyce as Lyle * Desir√©e Smith as Mavis * Angela Punch McGregor as Mrs. Lovell * Melissa Jaffer as Aunt Westbury * Lynette Curran as Mrs. Hansen * Duncan Wass as Bert * Lyn Treadgold as Prison matron * Rosemary Harris as Isobel ==Original novel== The novel was published in 1962. It had been written in a TB hospital. The novel was submitted for the Miles Franklin Award. Rohan died in 1963, having only published one other book in her lifetime. The novel was re-published in 1986. ==Production== Rights to the novel were purchased by first time producers Alex Cutler and Michael Wilcox in 1985. They had been trying to obtain the rights to another Australian novel but had difficulty negotiating with the author; someone suggested they have a look at The Delinquents, which Penguin were about to reissue. They obtained finance from the New South Wales Film Corporation and Australian Film Commission and hired Lex Marinos to write a draft. In 1987 David Bowie announced in an interview he thought the book would make a good film, which re-ignited a great deal of interest in the project.Patricia Amad & Philippa Hawker, \\"The Delinquents\\", Cinema Papers, July 1989 p4-7 Bowie subsequently distanced himself from the film's production, and interviewed in 1990, he cited \\"a large artistic disagreement with [the] producers\\" over the direction of the film as the reason he was no longer involved in the film. He said, \\"the book that I read and the film that they were making had nothing to do with each other\\", adding \\"it was a wonderful little book and it should have been a little film. It should have been an Australian film.\\"The Simon Bates interviews, BBC Radio 1, Jan-Feb 1990 The Australian Film Commission provided further script development money enabling Dorothy Hewett to write a second draft. Greg Coote and John Tarnoff of Village Roadshow became involved and Coote suggested Kylie Minogue play the lead. At one stage Ben Mendelsohn was signed to appear opposite her but eventually it was decided to go with an imported actor so the film might appeal to an international market: Charlie Schlatter was chosen.Helen Barlow, \\"The Australian Film Finance Corporation\\", Cinema Papers, August 1991 p36 Chris Thomson was approached to direct. He did not like the script but thought the book was wonderful, so managed to persuade the producers to hire Mac Gudgeon, who had made Waterfront (1983) with Thomson, to work on the script. Village Roadshow agreed to provide half the budget and the producers applied to the FFC for further finance in October 1988. The film was partly shot at Warner Bros studios on the Gold Coast. ==Release and reception== ===Reception=== DVD.net later gave the movie a mixed review, scoring it 5/10.http://www.dvd.net.au/review.cgi?review_id=5145 On Scoopy.com, the reviewer complimented the film's cinematography, the period details and Minogue's lead role in the film.http://www.scoopy.com/delinquents.htm The Radio Times grades the film two stars out of five, calling it a \\"passable tale of teenage torment\\".http://www.radiotimes.com/film/mv4bp/the-delinquents ===Novel=== The Delinquents was re-released in the 1989 to tie-in with the release of the film.http://cgi.ebay.com/DELINQUENTS-Book-Movie-1989-PB- Rohan-/250805309102?pt=AU_Fiction_Books_2&hash;=item3a65294eae There are some differences between the film and the novel. For example, in the novel, Lola is part Asian and suffers a miscarriage on the grounds of the all-girls school. It is uncertain whether the screenplay was adjusted or the missing parts of the book were filmed and removed to meet a lower certificate. ===Box office and initial screening=== The Delinquents grossed $3,370,650 at the Australian box office in Australia. It was the most successful Australian film of 1990 on Australian soil. In the United Kingdom it reached number one, grossing ¬£1,072,110 in its first week. It was the 17th highest-grossing film of 1989 there.http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/yearlychartspage.php?year=1989 After a London world premiere, The Delinquents opened in Australia and New Zealand on 21 December 1989 in wide release. Five days after the Australasian release date, it opened in the United Kingdom on 26 December 1989. It was later announced that the film would be released in other European countries; it was released on 1 June 1990 in Finland and Sweden under the name Delinquents ‚Äì Nuoret Kapinalliset. It opened in the Netherlands on 8 June.It was released on 15 June 1990 in Denmark under the name For ung til k√¶rlighed. Then Portugal on 29 June. Its last release was in Germany. Despite having chosen an American lead actor and an American composer, with an eye to the American market, the film was never released in the United States, in part due to a problem with distribution. This led to the production company filing a lawsuit against Village Roadshow Pictures and the FFC. ===Home media=== The Delinquents was released as VHS worldwide in 1989 and released on DVD in Australia only. The film was released internationally on digital platforms, including iTunes in 2016. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack album was released in Australia and New Zealand by Mushroom Records and in the UK by PWL Records.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097182/soundtrack The soundtrack release consisted of old standards (one of them performed by Minogue and one by Johnny Diesel and the Injectors), as well as one track from the film's score. \\"Tears on My Pillow\\" was released as a single in November 1989, peaking at number 20 in Australia. \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\" was released as the second single in January 1990, peaking at number 11 in Australia.

Some of them can be classified by their geographic location: the Geleontes, the Argadeis, the Hopletes, and the Agikoreis, in Ionia ; the Hylleans, the Pamphyles, the Dymanes, in the Dorian region. ==Attic tribes== The best-attested new system was that created by Cleisthenes for Attica in or just after 508 BC. The landscape was regarded as comprising three zones: urban (asty), coastal (paralia) and inland (mesogeia). Each zone was split into ten sections called trittyes ('thirdings'), to each of which were assigned between one and ten of the 139 existing settlements, villages or town-quarters, which were henceforth called demoi. Three sections, one each from urban, coastal and inland, were then put together to form a tribe. The 30 sections therefore yielded ten tribes, each named after a local hero and each with a geographically scattered membership roughly equal in size and hereditary in the male line thenceforward. They rapidly took on various functions. They became the brigading units for the army; constituencies for the election of magistrates, especially the ten generals (strategoi), for the section of members of the Council of 500 (boule) and of the 6,000 jurors, and for the selection of boards of administrative officials of every kind: and bases for the selection of competing teams of runners, singers or dancers at various festivals. They had their own corporate life, with officials and sanctuaries, and came to have an official order: 1. Erechtheis (·ºòœÅŒµœáŒ∏Œ∑ŒêœÇ), 2. Aigeis (Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ∑ŒêœÇ), 3.

Arcadia, 2. Achaea, 3. Elis, 4. Boeotia, 5. Delphi, 6. Dorians, 7. Ionians, 8. population of Euboea, 9. the islands and 10.

The series tells the story of a fictitional average middle-class Melbourne family and the effect that the Second World War and the immediate post-war events had on their lives. It covers the period between 1 September 1939 to 22 August 1948. It was a consistent ratings success in Australia, and also became popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Gibraltar, Greece and New Zealand. ==Pre-production== The show was purchased by Channel Nine without a pilot program being produced. They commissioned 34 hours with a view to extension. Fourteen writers were assigned to the thirteen plot lines which had been devised. The cast had not been established when they started writing the series and three months later they still had only two cast members, Vikki Hammond and Noni Hazlehurst. When researching the time period, the set designer Nick Rossendale said at the time \\"when you are dealing with a period of time that is well within living memory, you have to watch things very carefully\\". Hence, the painstaking research into the reality of the show. In 1976, the show was regarded as an ambitious project with the biggest budget ever for a commercial network series. It reputedly cost one million dollars to set up. ==Story and setting== The story began in 1939, with the declaration of war against Germany. From the outset the series focused on the Sullivan family of fictitious address 7 Gordon Street, Camberwell, Victoria, along with neighbourhood friends, relatives and associates. The majority of show's storylines related to the war, focusing on either the fighting itself or its effect on the Sullivan family. Scenes of battles in North Africa, Greece, Crete, Britain, New Guinea and Malaya were all filmed in or around Melbourne. However, some of the exterior scenes in the Netherlands were actually filmed in Amsterdam. The series was renowned for its high production standards. The programme's researchers went to great lengths to ensure both historical and cultural accuracy. Many scenes were timestamped and the scripts referenced actual military developments and events of the time, such as discussion of specific battles, sporting results and cinematic releases. For instance, this even went down to the weather, where the researchers checked through back copies of newspapers.TV Week magazine, 11 September 1976 ‚Äì \\"The Sullivans Bring Back the War Years\\" by Eric Scott, pp 6‚Äì7. Authentic 1930s furniture was located and used on sets, while kitchen pantries and the corner store were stocked with packaged goods of the era. The set designer Nick Rossendale said it was a \\"fascinating job\\" to find these items. He went on to say that the big companies would say to him they didn't have anything for him but he persisted by asking if he could look through their warehouses. \\"When I got in, I usually found something\\", he said. \\"It's amazing what a bit of research and looking around will dig up. The forgotten stuff that was lying around was unbelievable. No one knew it was there.\\" For instance, he found \\"hundreds of old pub mirrors labels, completely clean and unused\\" with every one of them \\"for a certain period of time\\". He said \\"to reproduce these would have cost a fortune but we can now label any product ‚Äì can or bottle ‚Äì with a real label so it won't be a reproduction at all.\\" ==Characters== * Grace Sullivan (n√©e Grace Katherine Donovan) ‚Äì born 24 October 1900 (Lorraine Bayly) was the Sullivan matriarch. The daughter of Dr Edmond Donovan, she married David Sullivan, a young soldier invalided from the battlefront, on 4 April 1919. She was intelligent, rational and greatly respected by her family. Although opposed to her sons enlisting to fight, she eventually came to terms with this. Grace was a devout Catholic, which sometimes created tension with husband Dave, who was a non-practising Anglican. Later in the series she flew to London at the request of the War Office, to assist with the recovery of her son John. There she was killed when a German V-1 flying bomb struck John's flat on 6 July 1944 (episode 598). * Dave Sullivan (Paul Cronin) ‚Äì born 19 February 1898 ‚Äì was an upright, hard-working and somewhat old-fashioned patriarch. He was a foreman at a small engineering firm and a veteran of the First World War, serving in the light horse in the Middle East. At the outbreak of war in 1939 Dave encouraged his sons to fight; later in the series he eventually enlisted himself, reaching the rank of major in the engineering corps. Dave was hit by a car on 20 August 1948 (episode 1112) and he died the following day (episode 1113), an event that marked the final scenes of the entire series. * John (John David Sullivan) ‚Äì born 12 October 1919 (Andrew McFarlane) was Dave and Grace's eldest child. A medical student at Melbourne University in 1939, he was vehemently opposed to the war, leading to many confrontations with his more traditionalist father. John's relationship with German-born Anna Kaufman (Ingrid Mason) also caused complications. Anna died on 20 December 1940 (episode 117). After her death, John relented and joined the medical corps, leaving the family on 4 June 1941 (episode 228). He was lost at sea and, for two years, presumed dead. His return to the series prompted Grace Sullivan to fly to England where John was convalescing. John featured in \\"The John Sullivan Story\\" (see below) and intermittently in the series again between episodes 505 and 616. * Tom (Thomas William Sullivan) ‚Äì born 12 June 1921 (Steven Tandy) was the second Sullivan child, an engineering student who, unlike his brother John, was keen to sign up and fight for his country. Tom served the duration of the series in the military, serving in North Africa, Greece, Crete, the Netherlands and Malaya and eventually reaching officer rank. Late in the series he returned to civilian life, took up university studies and married an American lawyer, Patti Spencer (Penny Downie) on 4 September 1946 (episode 922), though it was not a successful marriage. * Terry (Terence Charles Sullivan) ‚Äì born 7 April 1924 (Richard Morgan) was the third and youngest Sullivan son. A scampish schoolboy at the beginning of the series, as he matured he harboured dreams of joining the Air Force, but an inner ear problem prevented this (episode 294) and he joined the army instead (episode 301). He later married Caroline O'Brien (Toni Vernon episodes 273 to 493; Genevi√®ve Picot episodes 666 to 888) on 22 September 1942 (episode 334); however the war took a greater psychological toll on Terry than his brothers; he was interned in Changi Prison and he struggled both with his marriage and his readjustment to civilian life. Terry was jailed on 9 May 1946 for ten years for stealing explosives and assault (episode 886). He escaped from jail with Victor Fisher, another inmate, on 18 August 1948 (episode 1111). He was indirectly responsible for the death of his father Dave in the concluding episode of the series. * Kitty (Katherine Mary Sullivan) ‚Äì born 5 February 1926 (Susan Hannaford). The youngest child and the only girl. Shy, sensitive and conscientious, Kitty is a romantic who finds the best in everyone. She was upset by the war early in the series, and was prone to outbursts of emotion. Her character strengthened as the series progressed, and in 1943 (episode 427) she decided to take up nursing. Kitty married war correspondent Robbie McGovern (Graham Harvey) on 7 October 1944 (episode 668). The couple had a daughter, Grace McGovern (named after Kitty's mother), born on 13 May 1945 (episode 769). Robbie, affected by his war experiences, later committed suicide (episode 868). * Uncle Harry (Michael Caton) was Dave's younger brother, a wise-cracking larrikin with a fondness for goods of dubious origin ('fallen from the back of a truck'). His syrupy wife Rose (Maggie Dence) suffered depression and drowned in the Yarra River during a picnic on 31 December 1941 (episode 268). This had a devastating impact on Harry. Harry received a three-month jail sentence on 22 May 1944 (episode 578) for dealing with stolen goods. After leaving jail, Harry set up his own business. He left the family to go to Queensland, finding there was money in Army disposals (episode 744). * Maggie Hayward (Vikki Hammond) was the divorced owner of the local pub the 'Great Southern', and Jack (Reg Gorman) her barman. Both were well known to Dave Sullivan, Maggie as a former girlfriend and Jack through military service together during the First World War. The bar of the Great Southern was a common setting throughout the series. * Norm Baker (Norman Yemm) was another of Dave Sullivan's army comrades. He served in the same regiment as Dave in the First World War and was a close family friend. Like Dave he was old-fashioned, straight-talking and fond of a beer. He enlisted with Tom Sullivan at the beginning of the series and served the entire war, becoming a captain. He married his first wife, Melina Tsangarakis (Chantal Contouri), a Cretan, on 5 March 1942 (episode 286). She was executed by a Nazi officer, Heinrich Krull, on 13 April 1942 (episode 298). He later returned to Australia and married Maggie Hayward on 30 June 1943 (episode 408). Norm was later involved in an SOE mission to track down Heinrich Krull whom he killed on 10 October 1944 (episode 672). * Ida Jessup (Vivean Gray) was the Sullivans' English-born next-door neighbour, brought up in Battersea. Her late husband had served in the First World War before being gassed and invalided back to Britain. At times prone to meddling and puritanical gossip, Mrs Jessup's character mellowed to show great strength and understanding as the series progressed. Later in the series she married Englishman Arthur Pike (Wallas Eaton) on 26 July 1946 (episode 908). * Bert Duggan (Peter Hehir) and his neglected wife Lil (Noni Hazlehurst) appeared in the early seasons as lodgers taken in by Mrs Jessup. Bert, a devious womaniser, enlisted to escape arrest for illegal bookmaking; he was unable to cope with the rigours of war and later died from his wounds in North Africa on 30 March 1942 (episode 292). * The Kaufmans - father Hans (Leon Lissek), mother Lottie (Marcella Burgoyne) and daughter Anna (Ingrid Mason) were German-born immigrants who owned the local shop, the Universal Store. Although they opposed the Nazi German regime their German status created problems for them at the outbreak of war, and Hans and Lottie were eventually interned as enemy aliens (episode 76). Anna was saved from this fate by hastily marrying John Sullivan; however, she later fell ill and died. ==Critical and popular reception== The Sullivans attracted critical acclaim and was also one of Australia's most popular drama series, screening in half-hour episodes at 7:00 p.m. In 1978 it was the third most popular show on Australian TV, after Are You Being Served? and Against the Wind. The show's popularity waned somewhat after 1979 following the departure of Lorraine Bayly. When she asked to leave the series the show's producers instead offered her six months leave. Her character Grace was sent to London to care for her injured son John, and a series of pre-taped segments were used in her absence to maintain her presence. The London scenes featured actors imported from New Zealand so Australian viewers would not recognise familiar actors. When Bayly refused to return after six months, she was written out of the series and Grace was killed by a V1 bomb during a London air raid. Despite Bayly's departure ratings remained high enough for the series to remain in production. In 1981 the war ended in the storyline and there were plans for the series to continue with examinations of elements of post-war Australian history such as the Snowy River hydro-electric scheme. However, the decision of Paul Cronin to leave the series at this time prompted the show's cancellation before any of this could come to fruition. The final scenes were shot on 19 July 1982.TV Week - 10-16 July 1982 ==Logie Awards== In the first full year of production, The Sullivans walked away with five Logies in 1978. Paul Cronin was Most Popular Australian Actor, Lorraine Bayly was Most Popular Australian Actress, Michael Caton won for Best Sustained Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Vivean Gray won for Best Sustained Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role and, finally, the show won Most Popular Australian Drama.TV Week magazine, 11 March 1978 ‚Äì \\"The Sullivans Are Adopted\\", page 6.

The series was sold to over 45 countries worldwide. The first country to air the programme outside of Australia was the Republic of Ireland. The first episode was aired on RT√â One on Thursday evening at 7.30 pm from September 22nd 1977, its first showing was 1 hour, and later in the 1980s / '90s, at an earlier slot of 5:30 p.m. In the United Kingdom The Sullivans started on the ITV network on 18 October 1977,ITV broadcast dates in this paragraph have been researched from TV Times (UK edition - various regions) and The Times (microfilm version) for the period 1977 to 1994. less than a year after its debut in Australia and was initially networked by Thames Television to all 15 ITV companies in a Tuesday and Wednesday 3:50 p.m. afternoon slot. The series was shown weekly on Thursdays from 12 January 1978; a Tuesday and Thursday pattern started on 19 September 1978 and then a weekly Friday showing started on 5 January 1979. ATV were the first region to break away from the networked episodes, showing a one-hour version of the programme for 11 weeks from 6 January 1978 at 2:25 p.m., before returning to the 30 minute format. When networked repeats of the ATV drama serial The Cedar Tree ended in June 1979, The Sullivans briefly took its place in the 12:30 p.m. lunchtime slot and was stripped five days a week, but this new timeslot lasted only a matter of weeks and it was moved back to the weekly Friday afternoon slot on 13 July 1979. The Sullivans disappeared from the schedules briefly after the ITV strike, and on 23 November 1979 the series resumed in all regions (apart from ATV), once again in the 12:30 p.m. lunchtime slot, initially four days a week, but reduced to three and then two episodes per week during 1980, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Some regions broke away from the networked episodes during 1980 and began scheduling The Sullivans on different days and times. Although most still favoured the 12:30 p.m. lunchtime slot, these regions showed the programme less often than Thames and rapidly began falling behind in the storyline. ATV left the series on 15 October 1981 and Yorkshire Television followed suit, leaving the series at episode 284 on 2 December 1982, opting for local programming instead. Border Television, Tyne Tees Television, and Ulster Television continued to screen their episodes via the Thames Television feed throughout the series's entire run, and these regions were the first to complete the series, broadcasting the final episode on Thursday 6 October 1988. TVS and Channel Television finished the series on 15 February 1989 and Granada Television showed the final episode on 28 August 1989. TSW started showing the series in an afternoon slot at 1:30 p.m. on Fridays from 6 January 1989. From 4 September 1989 the 12:30 p.m. slot was used for Home and Away and the remaining regions still showing The Sullivans also moved the programme to an afternoon slot for the remainder of its run‚Äîinitially 1:30 p.m. (Anglia/HTV) and 2:30 p.m. (Scottish/Grampian). Anglia Television left the series at episode 868 on 23 July 1990; Grampian Television also left the programme on 30 August 1990. HTV reached the final episode on 8 June 1993 (having temporarily stopped showing the series throughout 1992). Scottish Television left the series on 18 December 1993 at episode 1069, having shown its last few editions on Saturday afternoons at 3:10 p.m. When Westcountry Television took over from TSW in 1993, they initially dropped The Sullivans from their schedule, only to bring it back due to popular demand on 23 April 1993, before finally leaving the series on 22 December 1994. The Sullivans has also had a lengthy run on satellite and cable television in the UK. Episodes 1 to 258 were screened on Sky Channel (renamed Sky One on 30 July 1989) between 6 February 1989 Sky Television broadcast dates researched from Satellite TV Europe, Satellite Times and TV Guide (UK edition) for the period 1989 to 1990 to 2 February 1990, initially at 11:30 a.m., then 10:00 a.m. from 17 April 1989. In 1994 the series enjoyed another repeat run on satellite channel UK Gold. Episodes 1 to 259 were broadcast at 7:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. from 3 January 1994UK Gold broadcast dates have been researched from Radio Times (print version) for the period 1994 to 1998 to 30 December 1994. The remaining episodes (omitting episode 260) were shown from 3 July 1995, broadcast at 9:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. The afternoon episode was dropped on 4 March 1996 with a weekly omnibus being shown in place of it on Saturdays at 7:55 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. from 8 February 1997). The daily episodes were later moved to 10.30 a.m. on 21 October 1996 where it stayed in that slot until the final episode on 8 October 1998. In Gibraltar the series was a Sunday night TV staple on GBC TV in Gibraltar, where The Sullivans aired as double episodes every Sunday night from 8:45 p.m. throughout the 1980s. The series was amongst the most popular programmes in Gibraltar at the time. In the early 1980s, the series was syndicated in North America. The stations that showed the programme included WLVI Boston, WTVT Tampa, and CKRD-TV Red Deer. ==Actors== === Notable short-term cast === The Sullivans employed scores of actors in short-term and supporting roles, so becoming something of a proving ground for young Australasian talent. Many of the young actors who worked on the series during its run would later enjoy successful careers, such as: * Kerry Armstrong (episodes 281 to 282 and 1061 to 1062) * Mel Gibson (episodes 369 to 372) * Dannii Minogue * Kylie Minogue (episodes 635 to 642) * Sam Neill (episodes 519 to 558) * Gary Sweet (episodes 739 to 1114 * Sigrid Thornton (episodes 132 to 151) *The series also featured many veteran actors in roles * Patricia Kennedy * Bud Tingwell (credited as Charles Tingwell) (episodes 116 to 117 and 919 to 923) * Vincent Ball * Gus Mercurio * Maurie Fields * Patsy King * John Waters (episodes 561 to 592 and 709 to 710) * John Orcsik ==DVD releases== The first 26 episodes of the series were initially released on DVD in the Netherlands.

Slogan about Gross National Happiness in Thimphu's School of Traditional Arts. Gross National Happiness (also known by the acronym: GNH) is a philosophy that guides the government of Bhutan. It includes an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population. Gross National Happiness Index is instituted as the goal of the government of Bhutan in the Constitution of Bhutan, enacted on 18 July 2008. ==History== The term \\"Gross National Happiness\\" was coined in 1972 by Sicco Mansholt, one of the Founding Fathers of the European Union and the fourth President of the European Commission. GNH is often misattributed to Bhutan's fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck who popularized the concept in the late 1990s.\\"The Origin of GNH - The European GNH Institute (2018)\\" In 2011, The UN General Assembly passed Resolution \\"Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development\\" urging member nations to follow the example of Bhutan and measure happiness and well- being and calling happiness a \\"fundamental human goal.\\" In 2012, Bhutan's Prime Minister Jigme Thinley and the Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon of the United Nations convened the High Level Meeting: Well-being and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm to encourage the spread of Bhutan's GNH philosophy. At the High Level meeting, the first World Happiness Report was issued. Shortly after the High Level meeting, 20 March was declared to be International Day of Happiness by the UN in 2012 with resolution 66/28. Bhutan's Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay proclaimed a preference for focus on more concrete goals instead of promoting GNH when he took office, but subsequently has protected the GNH of his country and promoted the concept internationally. Other Bhutanese officials also promote the spread of GNH at the UN and internationally. == Definition == GNH is distinguishable from Gross Domestic Product by valuing collective happiness as the goal of governance, by emphasizing harmony with nature and traditional values as expressed in the 9 domains of happiness and 4 pillars of GNH. According to the Bhutanese government, the four pillars of GNH are: # sustainable and equitable socio- economic development; # environmental conservation; # preservation and promotion of culture; and # good governance. The nine domains of GNH are psychological well-being, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards. Each domain is composed of subjective (survey-based) and objective indicators. The domains weigh equally but the indicators within each domain differ by weight. The domains work differently depending on the person's GDP. For instance, if there are two people, one whose life is consumed with working, leaving barely any time for friends and family, while the other, though not as good in working conditions, has still enough time to spend quality time with their friends and family: according to Carol Graham, the person who spends time with family and friends ends up having a larger GNH, than the person who is just in it for work. In other words, a person is happier, or can be happier, in life when focusing on the little things. ==Bhutanese GNH index== Several scholars have noted that ‚Äúthe values underlying the individual pillars of GNH are defined as distinctly Buddhist,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGNH constructs Buddhism as the core of the cultural values of the country (of Bhutan). They provide the foundation upon which the GNH rests.‚ÄùKent Schroeder, Politics of Gross National Happiness: Governance and Development in Bhutan, Cham (Switzerland): Palgrave Macmillan, 2018, 27. GNH is thus seen as part of the Buddhist Middle Path, where ‚Äúhappiness is accrued from a balanced act rather than from an extreme approach.‚ÄùChhewang Rinzin, On the Middle Path: The Social Basis for Sustainable Development in Bhutan, Utrecht: Copernicus Institute, 2006, 3. ===Implementation in Bhutan=== The body charged with implementing GNH in Bhutan is the Gross National Happiness Commission. The GNH Commission is composed of the Prime Minister as the Chairperson, Secretaries each of the ministries of the government, and the Secretary of the GNH Commission. The GNH Commission's tasks include conceiving and implementing the nation's 5-year plan and promulgating policies. The GNH Index is used to measure the happiness and well-being of Bhutan's population. A GNH Policy Screening Tool and a GNH Project Screening Tool is used by the GNH commission to determine whether to pass policies or implement projects. The GNH Screening tools used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan. In 2008, the first Bhutanese GNH survey was conducted. It was followed by a second one in 2010. The third nationwide survey was conducted in 2015. The GNH survey covers all twenty districts (Dzonkhag) and results are reported for varying demographic factors such as gender, age, abode, and occupation. The first GNH surveys consisted of long questionnaires that polled the citizens about living conditions and religious behavior, including questions about the times a person prayed in a day and other Karma indicators. It took several hours to complete one questionnaire. Later rounds of the GNH Index were shortened, but the survey retained the religious behavioral indicators. The Bhutan GNH Index was developed by the Centre for Bhutan Studies with the help of Oxford University researchers to help measure the progress of Bhutanese society. The Index function was based on Alkire & Foster method of 2011. After the creation of the national GNH Index, the government used the metric to measure national progress and inform policy. The Bhutan GNH Index is considered to measure societal progress similarly to other models such as the Gross National Well- being of 2005, the OECD Better Life Index of 2011, and SPI Social Progress Index of 2013. One distinguishing feature of Bhutan GNH Index from the other models is that the other models are designed for secular governments and do not include religious behaviour measurement components. The data is used to compare the happiness between different groups of citizens, and changes over time. According to the World Happiness Report 2019, Bhutan is 95th out of 156 countries.Why happiness is easy to venerate, hard to generate, Tim Harford, Financial Times, 1 March 2019. The holistic consideration of multiple factors through the GNH approach has been cited as impacting Bhutan's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ===Dissemination=== In Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, a shortened version of Bhutan's GNH survey was used by the local government, local foundations and governmental agencies under the leadership of Martha and Michael Pennock to assess the population of Victoria. In the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Susan Andrews, through her organization Future Vision Ecological Park, used a version of Bhutan's GNH at a community level in some cities. In Seattle, Washington, United States, a version of the GNH Index was used by the Seattle City Council and Sustainable Seattle to assess the happiness and well-being of the Seattle Area population. Other cities and areas in North America, including Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Creston, British Columbia and the U.S. state of Vermont, also used a version of the GNH Index. At the University of Oregon, United States, a behavioral model of GNH based on the use of positive and negative words in social network status updates was developed by Adam Kramer. In 2016, Thailand launched its own GNH center. The former king of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was a close friend of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, and conceived the similar philosophy of Sufficiency Economy. In the Philippines, the concept of GNH has been lauded by various personalities, notably Philippine senator and UN Global Champion for Resilience Loren Legarda, and former environment minister Gina Lopez. Bills have been filed in the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives in support of Gross National Happiness in the Philippines. Additionally, Executive Director of Bhutan‚Äôs GNH Center, Dr. Saamdu Chetri, has been invited by high-level officials in the Philippines for a GNH Forum. Many other cities and governments have undertaken efforts to measure happiness and well-being (also termed \\"Beyond GDP\\") since the High Level Meeting in 2012, but have not used versions of Bhutan's GNH index. Among these include the national governments of the United Kingdom's Office of National Statistics and the United Arab Emirates, and cities including Somerville, Massachusetts, United States, and Bristol, United Kingdom. Also a number of companies which are implementing sustainability practices in business that have been inspired by GNH, while GNH also represents a form of leadership for sustainability that gains international recognition. Gross National Happiness is also promoted in the United States by a nonprofit organization, Gross National Happiness USA. Headquartered in Vermont, GNHUSA is a 501c(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization with a mission to increase personal happiness and the collective wellbeing by changing how the United States measure their progress and success. GNHUSA was founded after Linda Wheatley of Montpelier, Vermont, attended the 2008 Annual Gross National Happiness Research Conference in Thimphu, Bhutan. Wheatley returned to Vermont determined to introduce the little-known GNH concepts to the general public in the U.S. After establishing the nonprofit in the spring of 2009, representatives of the group attended the fifth international GNH research conference in Brazil in November 2009 and, in June 2010, hosted the first US-based conference on Gross National Happiness and other alternative indicators, at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. In May 2012, GNHUSA with co-sponsors organized Measure What Matters, a conference building a collaborative of data experts in Vermont. The state of Vermont's Governor declared April 13 (President Jefferson‚Äôs birthday) ‚ÄúPursuit of Happiness Day,‚Äù and became the first state to pass legislation enabling development of alternative indicators and to assist in making policy. GNHUSA collaborates with the Vermont Data Center to perform a periodic study of well- being in the state, as a pilot for other states and municipalities. The organization also collaborates closely with the Happiness Alliance in collecting online GNH data, based on the domain of happiness developed by Bhutan. In 2017, GNHUSA initiated the process of establishing chapters in all 50 states to work with local governments and institutions on well-being initiatives, beginning with Wisconsin and North Carolina. The organization also promotes the U.N.-designated International Happiness Day (March 20) as an opportunity to discuss the concepts of well-being with others at Happiness Dinners across the country. From August 25, 2012 to the present, GNHUSA has been carrying out a nationwide action research project, The Happiness Walk, carried out by GNHUSA board members and supporters. On the first leg, two GNHUSA board members walked 594 miles, from Vermont to Washington DC; the Walk most recently completed a leg from Santa Monica, CA to the Bay Area, with a side trip to Hawaii, and resumed March 1, 2018, walking from Petaluma CA to Seattle, Washington, on the 13th leg of the journey. Along the way, Walkers perform audio and video interviews and collect survey responses, introducing the concept of GNH and amassing data that will assist them in tailoring the GNH domains and indicators to American culture. GNHUSA also posts and promotes a Charter for Happiness which, as of May 7, 2018, has 469 signatories. ===Criticism=== GNH has been described by critics as a propaganda tool used by the Bhutanese government to distract from ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses it has committed. The Bhutanese democratic government started from 2008. Before then, the government practiced massive ethnic cleansing of non- Buddhist population of ethnic Nepalese of Hindu faith in the name of GNH cultural preservation. The NGO Human Rights Watch documented the events. According to Human Rights Watch, \\"Over 100,000 or 1/6 of the population of Bhutan of Nepalese origin and Hindu faith were expelled from the country because they would not integrate with Bhutan‚Äôs Buddhist culture.\\" The Refugee Council of Australia stated that \\"it is extraordinary and shocking that a nation can get away with expelling one sixth of its people and somehow keep its international reputation largely intact. The Government of Bhutan should be known not for Gross National Happiness but for Gross National Hypocrisy.\\" Some researchers state that Bhutan's GNH philosophy \\"has evolved over the last decade through the contribution of western and local scholars to a version that is more democratic and open. Therefore, probably, the more accurate historical reference is to mention the coining of the GNH phrase as a key event, but not the Bhutan GNH philosophy, because the philosophy as understood by western scholars is different from the philosophy used by the King at the time.\\" Other viewpoints are that GNH is a process of development and learning, rather than an objective norm or absolute end point. Bhutan aspires to enhance the happiness of its people and GNH serves as a measurement tool for realizing that aspiration.Sander G. Tideman (2016), Gross National Happiness: Lessons for Sustainability Leadership South Asian Journal of Global Business Research, Vol. 5 Iss 2 pp. 190 ‚Äì 213 Other criticism focuses on the standard of living in Bhutan. In an article written in 2004 in the Economist magazine, \\"The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is not in fact an idyll in a fairy tale. It is home to perhaps 900,000 people most of whom live in grinding poverty.\\" Other criticism of GNH cites \\"increasing levels of political corruption, the rapid spread of diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, gang violence, abuses against women and ethnic minorities, shortages in food/medicine, and economic woes.\\" ==See also== * Broad measures of economic progress * Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan * Economics * Happiness economics * Happy Planet Index * Human Development Index * Humanistic economics * Minister of happiness * Post- materialism * Small Is Beautiful * Subjective life satisfaction * Sufficiency economy * Utilitarianism * World Values Survey * Gross National Well-being * Social Progress Index * Better Life Index ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===References=== * Adler Braun, Alejandro.

Introduced in 1992, this was Hyundai's first engine designed entirely in-house. Design objectives were to provide high performance and good fuel economy with excellent durability at a reasonable cost.http://papers.sae.org/891185/ The first Œ±-series engine marketed was the Œ±-1.5D (Engine code:G4EK). It was a single overhead camshaft (SOHC), twelve (12) valve, inline-four, petrol-based and naturally aspirated version. An Œ±-series inline-four, dual overhead camshaft (DOHC), four valve per cylinder version later developed from the Œ±-1.5D.https://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-19/business/fi-4835_1_pikes-peak The Œ±-series engine debuted in the 1992 Hyundai Scoupe Asia Korea and Europe market and later used in other Hyundai models.https://www.automobilemag.com/news/hyundai-engines/amp/ The Œ±-series engine were initially produced in 1.3 L and 1.5 L, with only the 1.5 L offered in North America. A strengthened block, an eight-counterweight crankshaft, and hydraulic engine mounts were added in 2000 to reduce NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness). A 1.6 L version was introduced in 2001 and initially sold alongside earlier versions. The 1.3 L and 1.5 L were later dropped. The 1.6 L engine was further revised in 2005 with a 1.4 L version also available for certain markets. Known as the Alpha II it debuted in the Kia Rio JB. Notable features included a DOHC 16-valve cylinder head, graphite-coated pistons, a strengthened cylinder block, ribbed aluminum oil pan, coil-on-plug ignition, an enlarged throttle body (increased from 48 mm to 52 mm), a revised PCM (powertrain control module), simplified and shortened intake ducting, a revised intake manifold, and a returnless fuel system. These improvements further reduced NVH and emissions, with the 1.6 L version becoming ULEV- certified in all 50 U.S. states. In 2011 the Alpha engine was replaced with the Hyundai Gamma engine. ==1.3== G4EH in a 1999 Hyundai Accent L The G4EA/G4EH is a SOHC 12-valve 1.3 L (1341 cc) engine, with a bore and stroke of 71.5 mm and 83.5 mm, respectively.

Octopus Cards Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Octopus Holdings Limited. Established in 1994 under the name of \\"Creative Star\\" by the major transportation companies in Hong Kong, Octopus Cards Limited is the operator of the Octopus System and the issuer of Octopus. The Octopus card was introduced in 1997 with the aim of providing a simple way to pay fares on public transport in Hong Kong. Octopus then extended its reach into simple micropayments for purchases in retail outlets and a simple way for cardholders to gain access to buildings and schools and to identify themselves. In January 2002, it was renamed Octopus Cards Limited from Creative Star. Prompted by the business expansion of the Octopus card, Octopus Holdings Limited was formed in 2005 after a company restructure and Octopus Cards Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company. Today, over 440 service providers accept Octopus, and new uses are regularly being added. Octopus used to have a global reputation of world's leading and most extensive contactless smartcard system with the highest penetration, transaction volume and the widest scope of applications, now turned into an iconic symbol of \\"yesterday technology\\" under the rapid trend of mobile payments. ==Controversy over use of personal data== Octopus became the centre of a controversy in mid-2010, when some individuals complained that they had received unsolicited sales calls which they alleged came from business partners of Octopus. Octopus chief executive Prudence Chan initially denied that any personal data had been given over to third parties, but said that cardholders' consent to use their data would have been given when they registered for the Octopus reward program, which had an opt-out mechanism.Siu, Beatrice (8 August 2010) \\"'Your data's in safe hands'\\", The Standard The company came under fire for deception when a former worker at CIGNA, an insurance company said that Octopus had bought data on 2.4 million reward scheme cardholders.Yau, Thomas (15 July 2010). \\"Octopus in hot water over \`sold' personal data claim\\", The Standard At a hearing before the Privacy Commission on 26 July 2010, it was subsequently revealed that it had entered into partnership agreements through which card-holders' personal details were sold to CIGNA, an insurance company and others for HK$44 million. The company disclosed that personal data collected from Octopus rewards program had been sold to six vendors since 2002, and that two such relationships were still current. The company was further criticised when it was revealed that there were no safeguards on the transfer or reuse of the personal data to parties outside of Hong Kong.Chan, Samuel (27 July 2010). 'Tentacle of lies', The Standard Chan apologised before a Legislative Council's finance affairs panel meeting; she said that she 'might have used a wrong definition of selling [personal data] at the time'.

In the past, some woody forms of this species have been called C. frutescens, but the features that were used to distinguish those forms appear in many populations of C. annuum and are not consistently recognizable features in C. frutescens species. ==Characteristics== Although the species name annuum means ‚Äúannual‚Äù (from the Latin annus \\"year\\"), the plant is not an annual but is frost tender. In the absence of winter frosts it can survive several seasons and grow into a large, shrubby perennial herb. The single flowers are an off- white (sometimes purplish) color while the stem is densely branched and up to tall. The fruit are berries that may be green, yellow, orange or red when ripe. While the species can tolerate most frost-free climates, C. annuum is especially productive in warm and dry climates. ==Pollination== While generally self-pollinating, insect visitation is known to increase the fruit size and speed of ripening, as well as to ensure symmetrical development. Pepper flowers have nectaries at the base of the corolla, which helps to attract pollinators. The anthers do not release pollen except via buzz pollination, such as provided by bumble bees.Capsicum pollination ==Uses== ===Culinary=== Five colors of peppers in an Israeli supermarket The species is a source of popular sweet peppers and hot chilis with numerous varieties cultivated all around the world, and is the source of popular spices such as cayenne, chili, and paprika powders. Common naming in English falls generally in line with the flavor and size of the variant. Larger, sweeter variants are called \\"capsicums\\" in Australia and New Zealand and red or green peppers, or \\"bell peppers\\" in the United States and Great Britain. The smaller, hotter varieties are called chillis, chilies, chile, or chili peppers, or in parts of the US, \\"peppers\\". Capsinoid chemicals provide the distinctive tastes in C. annuum variants. In particular, capsaicin creates a burning sensation (\\"hotness\\"), which in extreme cases can last for several hours after ingestion. A measurement called the Scoville scale has been created to describe the hotness of peppers and other foods. ===Traditional medicine=== Hot peppers are used in traditional medicine as well as food in Africa.Grubben, G.J.H. & Denton, O.A. (2004) Plant Resources of Tropical Africa 2. Vegetables. PROTA Foundation, Wageningen; Backhuys, Leiden; CTA, Wageningen. English botanist John Lindley described C. annuum in his 1838 Flora Medica thus:Lindley, John (1838). Flora Medica, page 509. In Ayurveda, C. annuum is classified as follows: *Guna (properties) ‚Äì ruksha (dry), laghu (light) and tikshna (sharp) *Rasa (taste) ‚Äì katu (pungent) *Virya (potency) ‚Äì ushna (hot) ===Ornamental=== Some cultivars grown specifically for their aesthetic value include the U.S. National Arboretum's 'Black Pearl' and the 'Bolivian Rainbow'. Ornamental varieties tend to have unusually colored fruit and foliage with colors such as black and purple being notable. All are edible, and most (like 'Royal Black') are hot. ==Host plant== The potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) is an oligophagous insect that prefers to feed on plants of the family Solanaceae such as pepper plants. Female P. operculella use the leaves to lay their eggs and the hatched larvae will eat away at the mesophyll of the leaf. ==Gallery== File:Capsicum annuum-Red Chilli Pepper 01.jpgDried Capsicum annuum Red Chilli Pepper File:Capsicum annuum.JPGCapsicum annuum cultivars File:Capsicum annuum (Guajillo) - dried.jpgDried Guajillo chile pod File:RoyalEmbersFlower.JPGTypical C. annuum flower, Royal Embers.

He is stated as the \\"forger of all instruments of bronze and iron\\". A descendant of Cain, he was the son of Lamech and Zillah. Tubal-cain was the brother of Naamah and half-brother of Jabal and Jubal. == Jewish narrative == According to Rashi, Tubal-Cain's name literally means \\"Cain's-Spices\\", with the Hebrew word T≈´ÃÅ·∏áal (◊™◊ï◊ë◊ú) deriving from the word T≈´ÃÅ·∏álin (◊™◊ë◊ú◊ô◊ü) meaning spices. Rashi states that he was named this, because he \\"seasoned and improved the work of Cain\\" In other words, because he was a blacksmith, who helped to make weapons which could be used to kill more efficiently, he invokes his ancestor Cain's sin of murder. Futhermore according to Tanhuma bar Abba, one day, Tubal-cain and his father Lamech were hunting together with Tubal-cain serving as an aid for his blind father. In the distance is Cain who Lamech believes to be an animal. He confirms with Tubal-cain that, it is an animal, however Tubal-cain deceives his father, and lets him shoot and kill his forefather Cain, possibly because of Tubal-cain's blood lust. When Lamech realizes what he has done he throws his hands up in a fit of mourning, accidentally killing his son Tubal-Cain. However Genesis Rabbah disagrees with this narrative. Rabbi Abraham ben Isaiah & Rabbi Benjamin Sharfman (1949): The Pentateuch and Rashi's Commentary, A Linear Translation into English, Genesis 4:22 In Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus says that \\"Tubal exceeded all men in strength, and was very expert and famous in martial performances, ... and first of all invented the art of working brass.\\" == Christian Narrative == Tubal-cain at his forge, by Andrea Pisano, 1334-1336 In the King James Version, his name is rendered as Tubalcain. In the New International Version and the English Standard Version, it is Tubal-cain; the Latin Vulgate renders him as Thubalcain. It is not clear why he has a double-barreled first name. Gordon Wenham suggests that the name Cain means smith (which would anticipate the remarks about his metalworking skill), or that he is called Tubal Cain in order to distinguish him from the other Tubal, the son of Japheth.Gordon Wenham, Genesis 1‚Äì15 (Word, 1987), 113. Richard Coggins suggests it \\"may be a variant of the same tradition which lists Tubal in the table of nations\\" at , as a land well known for metalwork. In the Book of Jasher (Pseudo-Jasher) (1751), the name of Tubal-Cain is explained by Zillah, his mother: \\"After I had withered away have I obtained him from the Almighty God\\" (2:24). The intended conclusion here is that \\"Cain\\" (given earlier in the idea of \\"obtaining\\") was merged with \\"Tubal\\", a word seemingly to denote \\"withering\\" by contextual speculation. Genesis 4:22 says that Tubal-cain was the \\"forger of all instruments of bronze and iron\\" (ESV) or an \\"instructor of every artificer in brass and iron\\" (KJV). Although this may mean he was a metalsmith, a comparison with verses 20 and 21 suggests that he may have been the very first artificer in brass and iron. T. C. Mitchell suggests that he \\"discovered the possibilities of cold forging native copper and meteoric iron.\\"T. C. Mitchell, \\"Tubal-cain,\\" in New Bible Dictionary (IVF, 1962), 1302. Tubal-cain has even been described as the first chemist. Walter Elwell suggests that his invention of superior weapons may have been the motivation for Lamech's interest in avenging blood. Alternatively, E. E. Kellett suggests that Tubal-cain may have been a miner. ==Family tree== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Book of Genesis people Category:Bereshit (parsha) Category:Blacksmiths ","title":"Tubal-cain"},{"id":"1433747","text":"In complex analysis, Harnack's principle or Harnack's theorem is one of several closely related theorems about the convergence of sequences of harmonic functions, that follow from Harnack's inequality.

A year later, New York Times reviewer Ruth Reichl, in an ecstatic three-star review, reported that a woman at the next table was moaning in uncontrollable ecstasy as she ate, but it was impossible to determine what dish had provoked that reaction, since just about every entree was worthy of such moans. DiSpirito departed Union Pacific in 2004. From 2003 to 2004, DiSpirito starred in the NBC reality television show The Restaurant, which followed the launch and operation of a new Manhattan restaurant called Rocco's on 22nd.

Three soldiers who died after collapsing in the field in July 2013 were believed to have been climbing the mountain (see \\"Fan Dance\\") while undergoing Special Air Service selection.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-23615174 ==Access== The peak is a major objective in the Beacons Way, a long distance footpath which passes from east to west across the massif, and is open to all walkers. There is well made, evenly graded footpath from the Storey Arms on the A470, which is 1500 feet below. This and other paths on the mountain are the subject of ongoing repair and maintenance by the National Trust to limit the erosion caused by the passage of hundreds of thousands of walkers each year. There is also a major path from the Cribyn, a close-by peak to the east. ==Storey Arms== The Storey Arms is an outdoor education centre beside the A470, the main trunk road between the north and south of Wales, in the Brecon Beacons National Park near Libanus, Powys, Wales. Run by Cardiff City Council since 1971, the residential centre can accommodate up to 58 people. Its activities include kayaking and canoeing, caving, hill walking, rock climbing and white water rafting. The centre is at above sea-level, along the pass between Pen y Fan and Fan Fawr, at the foot of Corn Du. It takes its name from a large coaching inn with a pitched slate roof (named after a local landowner, Storey Maskelyne), which was demolished in 1924. The site of the original inn is east of the centre, on the northeastern edge of the Pont ar Daf car park. Buses stop on either side of the A470 outside the centre. The car park at Pont ar Daf, from the Storey Arms centre, is the most popular access point for tourists and walkers to Pen y Fan. The car park, which has space for around 50 cars, is owned by the Welsh Government. Toilet facilities are available at the site. A footpath connects the Storey Arms centre, bus stops and the Pont ar Daf car park to the path leading to Corn Du and Pen y Fan. ==Summit== A National Trust plaque marking the summit The summit lies on a ridge stretching from Talybont Reservoir in the east, to the A470. About to the south-west lies the subsidiary top of Corn Du, beyond which the terrain drops at a moderate angle to the subsidiary top of Y Gyrn then more steeply to the Storey Arms on the A470. To the east, the ridge drops steeply to the col connecting it to Cribyn, the next mountain along the ridge. From Corn Du, a ridge with an east- facing escarpment descends south towards Merthyr Tydfil. ==Archaeology== The summit is marked by a well preserved and structured Bronze Age cairn with a central stone cist, similar to that on the nearby summit of Corn Du. The grave is fitted with a series of concentric stone kerbs to protect the central mound from slippage. The cist is a box formed by vertical stone slabs near the centre of the barrow, and it is currently occupied by the National Trust sign, but will have originally held the ashes or other remnants of a dead person or persons since multiple burials together are common in the British Bronze Age. It also held grave goods left with the human remains, such as flint tools, cinerary urns, or flower tributes. The similar round barrow on Fan Foel was excavated in 2002-4 and revealed such items in the central cist, the flowers being those of meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria). ==Name== The name Pen y Fan consists of the Welsh words pen ('top, head, peak, summit', etc.), y ('the') and fan, a mutated form of ban ('summit, crest, peak, beacon, hill, mountain', etc.). The same noun ban, in its plural form bannau, is found in the Welsh name for the Brecon Beacons: Bannau Brycheiniog. There is no one standard translation of Pen y Fan, but 'the mountain's peak' or 'the beacon's summit' are both possible translations.On the elements pen and ban, see the standard historical dictionary of the Welsh language, Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru. == Geology == Pen y Fan is formed from various units of the Old Red Sandstone which were laid down during the Devonian period. The lower slopes of the mountain are formed from the sandstones and mudstones of the Senni Formation whilst the upper slopes are formed from those of the Brownstones Formation. The very summit, like that of neighbouring Corn Du, is composed of hard- wearing sandstones of the Plateau Beds Formation. The beds of sandstone dip gently southwards towards the South Wales Coalfield basin. The Brecon Beacons nurtured their own glaciers during the last ice age and both Cwm Llwch and Cwm Sere were excavated by glaciers which grew in the lee of the high ground. Llyn Cwm Llwch occupies a glacially excavated rock hollow and the lake is partly dammed by a late-glacial moraine.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 213 'Brecon' & accompanying sheet explanation The mountain is the highest point within the Fforest Fawr Geopark which was established in 2005 to promote economic development, particularly sustainable tourism, based on the area's geological heritage. ==Tommy Jones' Obelisk== Tommy Jones ObeliskThe summit Near the route from the Storey Arms (once a coaching inn on the Brecon to Merthyr road) to the summit is a memorial granite obelisk, with an inscription which reads: \\"This obelisk marks the spot where the body of Tommy Jones aged 5 was found. He lost his way between Cwm Llwch Farm and the Login on the night of August 4, 1900. After an anxious search of 29 days his remains were discovered Sept [2nd]. Erected by voluntary subscriptions. W Powell Price Mayor of Brecon 1901.\\" Tommy was the son of a Rhondda coal miner, and had been visiting his grandparents at the time. He died from exhaustion and hypothermia or exposure. How a small boy managed to climb so high remains a mystery. The obelisk, a useful landmark in misty conditions, was paid for by the proceeds of a memorial fund started when the jurors at the boy‚Äôs inquest waived their fees.Fuller account at http://www.breconbeacons.org/tommy-jones The search was used as the theme of the 1980 film, Tommy Jones.British Film Institute listing https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6dbf2188 ==Panorama== From the summit on a clear day the Bristol Channel (including the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm), Carmarthen Bay, Swansea Bay, the Gower Peninsula, the Black Mountains, the Cambrian Mountains, Exmoor, the town of Brecon and much of Mid Wales and the South Wales Valleys, and in a north-easterly direction the Clee Hills in South Shropshire can be seen. ==References== ==See also== *Beacons Way ==External links== * Computer generated summit panoramas North South Index * BBC Wales feature on the Beacons * National Trust walking route * www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Pen y Fan and surrounding area * Victim of the Beacons : The Tommy Jones Story from the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority * Walk up Pen y Fan from Storey Arms * Traffig Cymru - Traffic Wales CCTV camera at A470 Storey Arms Category:Marilyns of Wales Category:Hewitts of Wales Category:Nuttalls Category:Brecon Beacons Category:Landmarks in Wales Category:Mountains and hills of Powys Category:Highest points of Welsh counties Category:Hardys of Wales Category:Glyn Tarell ","title":"Pen y Fan"},{"id":"1433788","text":"A Military Encyclopedia or Farrow's Military Encyclopedia is an American encyclopedia published in New York in 1885.

The result of the election provided the first major upset of the by-elections in the 1987-1992 Parliament and was seen as embarrassing for the Labour Party, with the former Labour MP Jim Sillars winning the seat for the Scottish National Party with a majority of 3,554 votes and a large swing from Labour to the SNP.

At the previous general election Millan, a former Scottish Secretary, had easily held the seat for the Labour Party, increasing his vote share from 55% in 1983 to 64.9%. In contrast, his main rivals, the SDP and the Conservatives, had both seen their shares of the vote drop by over 7%. Meanwhile, the SNP had managed to increase their share of the vote by over 4%.

The game is controlled via a positional gun that resembles a full-sized crossbow. Exidy promoted Crossbow to arcade operators as being convertible to new themes released in the future. Five themed conversion kits were created, each commencing with the letter 'c': Cheyenne, Combat, Crackshot, Clay Pigeon, and the controversial Chiller. ==Gameplay== Arcade gameplay screenshot Arcade screenshot, showing where the red, green, and blue choices lead. The player protects a band of adventurers from afar by shooting objects that threaten them. The adventurers enter from the left-hand side of the screen and attempt to cross the screen unharmed. If the player helps them reach the opposite side of the screen safely, the adventurers survive to the next scenario, and new adventurers are occasionally granted between scenarios. In addition to the obstacles, the adventurers are vulnerable to the player's shots. The first time the player shoots an adventurer, an on-screen message is shown: \\"DON'T SHOOT YOUR FRIENDS!\\" Thereafter, shooting an adventurer will cause him/her to emit a cry of pain, and to walk at a slower pace the rest of the way. A second shot will kill the adventurer. Scenarios are chosen by shooting a destination on a map screen, which include: town, desert, volcano, cave, bridge, jungle, and castle. The goal is to reach the final scenario, past the castle, in which the player confronts the Master of Darkness, who presumably created the dangers in the game. Defeating the Master of Darkness requires shooting him in the eyes when they turn red (and deadly). The player is treated to a brief congratulation and a challenge to defeat the Master of Darkness again, \\"IF YOU DARE\\".

The 5th Brigade was created in 1981 from three former battalions of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). It later incorporated over 3,000 ex-ZANLA guerrillas from various units. The brigade was based in Gweru and participated in the Mozambican Civil War as well as a controversial domestic operation known as Gukurahundi which targeted defenceless Ndebele people and former Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) soldiers. The 5th Brigade was reactivated in 2006 following a prolonged period of inactivity.http://www.zimbabwedefence.com/News_51_Gets_Comm.html , accessed March 2009 ==Organization== The 5th Brigade was subordinate only to the Chief of the Zimbabwe National Army. In 1983, it consisted of five infantry battalions as well as an armoured company equipped with T-54 tanks. The brigade was at least partly mechanised and possessed a number of BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers. ==History== The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) was created in 1980 through the amalgamation of the former Rhodesian Army with the militant wings of two rival guerrilla organisations: the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). To ease the integration process, large numbers of former Rhodesian servicemen and guerrillas were demobilised and the remaining troops interspersed throughout new units. By 1981, the bulk of the ZNA's manpower was concentrated in thirty-seven new light infantry battalions composed of about 37,000 personnel, almost all of whom were former ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas. The battalions were to be trained by a combination of British and former Rhodesian military instructors. Guerrillas from both sides resisted integration by establishing separate camps. The infantry battalions were almost immediately wracked by inter-factional skirmishes in 1980 and again in 1981. Zimbabwean prime minister Robert Mugabe and his government responded by disbanding three battalions and reorganising the remainder into four separate brigades. Furthermore, all former guerrillas awaiting integration with their new units were to be disarmed en masse. Upon learning of this policy, some former ZIPRA personnel began to desert the army, taking their weapons with them. They complained that the disarmament campaign targeted them unfairly and was being used to buttress the military influence of ex-ZANLA troops at their expense. Mutinies by ZIPRA elements in the ZNA became notoriously common. In 1982 there were several hundred disgruntled and otherwise unemployed ZIPRA fighters at large in the provinces of Matabeleland South and Matabeleland North, many of whom had resorted to armed banditry. The Zimbabwean government referred to the ex-ZIPRA deserters simply as \\"dissidents\\". In the wake of escalating dissident activity, Mugabe announced his intention to form a fifth infantry brigade composed solely of ex-ZANLA troops. In August 1981, two preexisting ZANLA battalions and an additional 3,000 ZANLA guerrillas from various units were selected for training in the new 5th Brigade. The officers were largely drawn from ex-ZANLA officer candidates whose poor educational qualifications had resulted in their failing standardised officer school. A smaller number of ex-ZIPRA officers from 4th Brigade were also transferred to the 5th Brigade to serve in various technical and specialist roles. Unlike the ZNA's other four brigades, this unit was to be armed and trained by a special North Korean military mission. The 5th Brigade was not structured for conventional military operations but rather as a specialized counter- insurgency unit. Ex-ZIPRA and Rhodesian troops resented the brigade for its apparent exclusiveness and the fact that it was permitted to operate independently from the ZNA's normal command structure, being subordinate only to the Chief of the Army. The 5th Brigade was trained from August 1981 to June 1982 at Inyanga, an isolated mountain base near the Zimbabwean-Mozambican border. It was then moved to its permanent base in Gweru. At the time of its formation, the 5th Brigade was the ZNA's only mechanised infantry brigade, and most of its arsenal--including T-54 tanks, BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, BRDM-2 scout cars, towed anti-tank artillery, and multiple rocket launchers, far exceeded the capabilities of ground weapons in the other four brigades' inventories. However, serious practical difficulties also resulted in the brigade's use of unique codes and radio equipment which were otherwise incompatible with those of other army units. ===Mozambican Civil War=== The 5th Brigade was one of the first ZNA units to be deployed into Mozambique during the Mozambican Civil War. In mid-1982 the brigade was deployed to defend a strategic rail line from Beira to the Zimbabwean border from sabotage attempts by the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO). Counteroffensives against RENAMO were jointly planned at the command level by Zimbabwean, Mozambican, and North Korean officers. ===Tensions with ex-ZIPRA forces=== The 5th Brigade's independent nature soon placed it at sometimes violent odds with other brigades of the ZNA. In September 1982, some of its personnel fired on ex-ZIPRA troops serving in the 4th Brigade. This prompted a mass exodus of former ZIPRA personnel from 4th Brigade, which was forced to disband four of its battalions due to the loss of personnel to desertion. In December 1982, the 5th Brigade dismissed all its ex-ZIPRA officers. Ex-ZIPRA personnel accused the 5th Brigade of purposefully instigating tensions between the factional elements in the other four brigades. ===Anti-dissident operations=== In January 1983 the 5th Brigade was deployed into Matabeleland North with the objective of eliminating the local dissidents. Its anti-dissident campaign was known simply as Gukurahundi, a Shona language term defined as \\"the rain which blows away the chaff before spring\\". The word had been also been applied to ZANLA mobilization tactics during the Rhodesian Bush War in 1979. Prime Minister Mugabe had bestowed the nickname Gukurahundi to the brigade in December 1982 and it figured prominently in the 5th Brigade's emblems and standards. The Zimbabwean government provided the 5th Brigade with meticulous records of ex-ZIPRA deserters and demobilized ZIPRA personnel, who were to be detained for questioning. While the brigade's directives specified a search for ex-ZIPRA guerrillas, it failed to differentiate between those affiliated with ZIPRA and the same movement's political wing, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Prior to the deployment, this attitude had been reinforced by the alleged discovery of arms on several ZAPU properties, leading to the mass dismissal of ZAPU officials from the government and the arrest of senior ex-ZIPRA army officers. In March 1983, 5th Brigade troops ransacked the home of ZAPU chairman Joshua Nkomo, shooting three of his domestic staff during the raid. The 5th Brigade's commander, Perrance Shiri, perceived all ex-ZIPRA troops, including those employed in the civil service or the ZNA, as potential dissidents. Detention by the 5th Brigade was arbitrary and extrajudicial killings of ZIPRA veterans became frequent. The 5th Brigade imposed a curfew in Matabeleland North, banned the movement of civilians within the operational area, and closed the majority of local businesses. Its constituent battalions rounded up all the residents of a specific district and marched them to central locations, where they were collectively interrogated on dissident activity. The 5th Brigade also conducted house to house searches in Bulawayo for deserters and arms caches. In an attempt to isolate the civilian population from the dissidents, the brigade relocated a number of rural dwellers to police outposts, mining compounds, and old Rhodesian military bases repurposed into makeshift detention camps. Conditions in the camps quickly deteriorated due to overcrowded and inadequate facilities. ==Allegations of politicisation== The 5th Brigade has been frequently criticised for its apparent political nature. Responding to an inquiry about North Korea's role in the unit's formation, then-Prime Minister Mugabe simply stated that \\"they were trained by the North Koreans because we wanted one arm of the army to have a political orientation which stems from our philosophy as ZANU-PF\\". Zimbabwean Minister of Home Affairs and chief opposition figure Joshua Nkomo denounced the formation of the 5th Brigade as being politically motivated; he believed Mugabe was using the unit to intimidate his opponents and secure the forcible implementation of a de facto one-party state. Historian Paul Moorcraft claimed the 5th Brigade was \\"marked by its fanatical ideological loyalty to Mugabe...[it] was run from the prime minister's office and was answerable only to Mugabe\\". Another historian and noted sociologist, Ronald Weitzer, found that the 5th Brigade was perceived as being \\"highly politicised and loyal to the government, poorly led, and palpably anti-Ndebele\\". ==References== ==External links== *History of Matabeleland including the actions of the Fifth Brigade there *Some of the material here is drawn from a report compiled by the Legal Resources Foundation (LRF) and the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe (CCJP) entitled \\"Breaking the Silence, Building True Peace.

He was a bitter political opponent of Gaius Marius. He was consul in 109 BC, in that capacity he commanded the Roman forces in Africa during the Jugurthine War. In 107 BC he was displaced from his command by Marius. On his return he was granted a triumph and the cognomen Numidicus. He later became a censor, entering into exile in opposition to Marius. Metellus Numidicus enjoyed a reputation for integrity in an era when Roman politics was increasingly corrupt. William Smith, ed. (1867). \\"Metellus Numidicus\\". Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. == Youth and cursus honorum == The son of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Calvus, in his youth he was sent to Athens, where he studied under Carneades, celebrated philosopher and great master of oratory. He returned ostensibly cultured and with brilliant oratorical skills. He was a quaestor in 126 BC, a tribune in 121 BC, an aedile in 118 BC, a praetor in 115 BC, Governor of Sicily in 114 BC and elected consul in 109 BC. Accused of extortion on leaving his governorship, the judges were so convinced of his good character that they dismissed the case against him unexamined. Metellus was generous in his support of the arts, sponsoring his friend the poet Archias. Cicero spoke highly of Metellus' oratorical skills. == Jugurthine War and aristocratic politics == When Metellus was consul (in 109 with Marcus Junius Silanus), he took command of the war in Numidia against Jugurtha.CAECILIVS The war dragged out into a long and seemingly endless campaign as the Romans tried to inflict a decisive defeat on Jugurtha. Metellus gained just one important victory over Jugurtha at the Battle of the Muthul. Metellus, having his command prorogued stayed in Numidia for another year (108), laying siege to Jugurthine holdouts. His second-in-command, Marius, designing to displace Metellus as commander in Numidia, spread rumours that Metellus was dragging out the Jugurthine War in order to retain his command; Marius returned to Rome to seek election as Consul (for the year 107). Winning the election, he returned to Numidia to take control of the war. On his return to Rome, Metellus was surprised by the demonstrations of enthusiasm and recognition which he received from a faction of senators and the people who did not support Marius. He celebrated a triumph, acquiring the cognomen Numidicus, to Marius' irritation. Metellus Numidicus became the main leader of the aristocratic faction, opposing the rapid political ascent of the populist Marius, who was favoured by the people because he finished the war in Numidia by the imprisonment and killing of Jugurtha (thanks to a stratagem of Sulla). Marius' reforms of the Roman Army, where he recruited Romans without property and loyal to their general, was a turning point in Roman history, and the reforms were bitterly opposed by Numidicus' conservative faction. Metellus Numidicus was elected censor in 102 BC in partnership with his cousin Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius. During the censorship, he tried to expel Marius' ally Lucius Appuleius Saturninus from the Senate, but without success. Afterwards, Saturninus had his revenge when, having been elected tribune of the plebs, he and Marius proposed an agrarian law awarding land to Roman veterans, with an additional clause that obliged every Senator to swear allegiance to the agrarian law, under penalty of expulsion from the Senate and a heavy fine. In the Senate, Marius first declared that he would never take the oath, in which Metellus seconded him; in the event, however, Marius and all other senators but Metellus took the oath. Rather than swear obedience to a law he opposed, Metellus Numidicus resigned his Senate seat and paid the corresponding fine. After leaving the Forum, he said to his friends: ::To do harm is proper of the evil spirits; to do good without taking risks is proper of the ordinary spirits; the man of heart never ever deflects from what is fair and honest, never looking to rewards or to threats.Plutarch, Life of Marius. == Exile and later life == The tribune Saturninus proposed a law to exile Metellus Numidicus. Rather than face a confrontation between Saturninus' and his own supporters, who were prepared to defend him by force, Metellus departed into exile voluntarily, spending a year in Rhodes. He was accompanied into exile by a rhetorician, Lucius Aelius Praeconinus or Stilo, and pursued his study of philosophy while in Rhodes. Following the death of Saturninus and an electoral reverse for the popular party, the new tribune, Quintus Calidius, proposed to allow Metellus' return to Rome in 99 BC. His son, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius gained the cognomen Pius thanks to his faithful efforts in support of Calidius' proposal, which duly carried. Metellus returned to Rome and to his houses at the Palatine Hill and the Via Tiburtina and lived there the rest of his days, intervening little in public affairs. Cicero dubiously reports a rumour that Quintus Varius, the populist tribune of the plebs for 91 BC, ultimately poisoned Metellus ‚Äì presumably Metellus Numidicus. ==Quotes by Metellus== * To do harm is proper of the evil spirits; to do good without taking risks is proper of the ordinary spirits; the man of heart never ever deflects from what is fair and honest, never looking to rewards or to threats. * All men should not covet all things.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p.45;

It was commanded by Col. Robert J. Coates, former commanding officer of 1st Force Reconnaissance Company. Det One was activated on 19 June 2003 and had its headquarters at Camp Del Mar Boat Basin in Camp Pendleton, California. It was disbanded in 2006 and succeeded by the permanent United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). ==Personnel== The unit consisted of 81 Marines and 5 Navy Corpsmen divided among 4 sections: *reconnaissance element (30 men) *intelligence element (29 men), containing a headquarters element and :*a Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT), (9 men) :*a SIGINT support team (3 men) :*a human intelligence (HUMINT) exploitation team (HET), (6 men) :*an all-source fusion team (12 men) *fires element (7 men) *headquarters element The original Marines that formed the detachment were hand-picked from over 500 superior candidates. Despite common misconceptions, Det One was not a beefed-up Force Reconnaissance platoon. While the reconnaissance element was composed mostly of Force Recon Marines, they made up only 24 of the 86 members of the detachment. The detachment, though lacking organic aviation, operated under the Marine Air-Ground Task Force philosophy of leveraging integrated, complementary capabilities to be more effective than the sum of its parts. More than half of Det One's Recon Marines were trained Scout Snipers.Martin, Chris, Modern American Snipers: From The Legend to The Reaper---on the Battlefield with Special Operations Snipers, St. Martin's Press, 2014 ==Insignia== Detachment One's Insignia comes from the World War II Marine Raider's patch, a blue patch with a skull and stars. The insignia was created by then-GySgt Anthony Siciliano. The scarlet, blue, and gold disk represents the unit's joint Navy-Marine Corps origins. The crossed stiletto/lightning bolt represents the unit's special operations mission, and its global communications reach. The parachute wings represent airborne-qualified status and the mask above it represents the combatant diver qualification. ==History== Although Detachment One was a relatively new unit its heritage can be traced back to World War II Marine Raiders. In World War II, the Marine Raiders were formed to seize key beaches and hills and also conduct guerrilla-style strikes against Imperial Japanese Forces. After two years the Raiders were disbanded but they set the stage for other raider-style units like Detachment One. In 1986, when the Department of Defense established the new joint Special Operations Command, the Marine Corps opted not to participate. Then Commandant Paul X. Kelley expressed the belief popular in the Corps that Marines should support Marines, and that the Corps should not fund a special warfare capability that would operate independently of the Fleet Marine Force. The Corps wanted to retain the Corps' Force Reconnaissance units within the MAGTF command structure and prevent the development of an \\"elite\\" within the Marine Corps. Marine Corps leadership believed that such a development would be at the expense of the effectiveness of the Corps as a whole. However, following the September 11 attacks and the current global war on terror, that view began to shift. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld immediately directed the Marine Corps and USSOCOM to work more closely together in what would be called the global war on terror. Marine resistance to special warfare units dissipated when Marine leaders watched the Corps' \\"crown jewels\\" ‚Äì the 15th and 26th MEU Maritime Special Purpose Forces ‚Äì sit on the sidelines during the early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom while other special warfare units led the way. Resistance from SOF commanders already in-country and indifference from the Navy chain of command left the MEU(SOC)s unused for over a month, relegated to supporting roles where SOF lacked manpower. In October 2002, Commandant James L. Jones, after consultation with USSOCOM leaders, directed the establishment of a Marine unit for permanent USSOCOM employment. Out of this came the T/O for Detachment One, officially activated aboard Camp Pendleton on 19 June 2003. After completion of Navy special warfare (NSW) certification and other training, Det One was deployed to Iraq in March 2004 for Operation Iraqi Freedom. Operating under Naval Special Warfare Group One, Det One executed direct action, coalition support, and battlefield-shaping operations. A study conducted by the Joint Special Operations University (JSOU) found that > The trial deployment demonstrated the MCSOCOM Det could effectively conduct > direct action (DA) and special reconnaissance (SR). It is reasonable to > suggest that the Detachment could also conduct or support foreign internal > defense (FID), counter-terrorism (CT), special activities, selected theater > security cooperation plans (TSCP), and other tasks as required. Det One was dubbed as \\"Task Force Raider\\" and deployed alongside US Navy SEAL task units contained within Naval Special Warfare Task Group - Arabian Peninsula, which was part of CJSOTF-AP (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula). As the deployment took shape, the operators of the Task Unit Raider and Task Unit Thunder (built around GROM) would become the task force's primary direct action assets, operating in conjunction on multiple occasions. Det One's first \\"real\\" mission - a close target reconnaissance operation - was aided by a GROM sniper, in which the target (a suspected insurgent sniper) was apprehended by the GROM sniper. Task Unit Raider first operated in and around Baghdad before being ordered by CJSOTF-AP to send its snipers to al-Najaf (a stronghold for the Mahdi Army) to relieve pressure on the 11th MEU. Det One proceeded to demoralize the militiaman by \\"wiping out\\" dozens of enemy combatants, confusing them as to the point of origin of the unrelenting lethal fire. In addition, Det One kept their marksman on their SR-25s around the clock-providing no respite for the militia. Det One's Scout snipers also carried out two successful countersniper operations, obliterating Shia insurgent positions and the snipers themselves with .50-caliber Barret M82 fire. In preparation for the Second Battle of Fallujah, Marines from the Det One, along with Green Berets from the 5th SFG, SEALs, and Marine Force Recon, were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to the 7 November D-DAY when coalition forces entered the city.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.178 However, the deployment also revealed interservice tensions. The Navy commander of Naval Special Warfare Squadron One did not utilize Det One as a cohesive unit but parceled its capabilities as needed. In particular, the intelligence section was parceled out to other Navy units, instead of supporting Det One operations, as the Navy lacked intelligence personnel who understood ground combat. Following the conclusion of the deployment in September 2004, the Marine Corps and USSOCOM continued to negotiate details of the long-term relationship through 2005, while Det One trained for a possible second deployment. Though deployment proposals were rejected on the basis that Det One was to provide the nucleus of the future permanent MARSOC organization, it was disbanded on 10 March 2006 and its members dispersed throughout the Marine Corps. The experience of Det One provided critical intelligence on the organization and integration of a Marine special-operations force into USSOCOM and was instrumental to the planning of MARSOC. ==See also== *1st Force Reconnaissance Company *Force Reconnaissance *Radio Reconnaissance Platoon *Marine Forces Special Operations Command *Strider SMF ==References== ==External links== *ShadowSpear Special Operations Community Website & Forum Category:Special operations units and formations of the United States Detachment One Category:Inactive units of the United States Marine Corps ","title":"MCSOCOM Detachment One"},{"id":"1433857","text":"Scholz Research & Development, Inc. or SR&D; is the name of the company founded by musician and engineer Tom Scholz to design and manufacture music technology products. Scholz is an MIT-trained engineer who developed many of his skills working on audio-production equipment as a product design engineer at Polaroid in the early 1970s. A musician in his off-time, he developed a recording studio in the basement of the apartment building where he lived, utilizing many home-built devices. Recordings made in his home studio later became the debut album of the band Boston, while the Scholz's proceeds from the success of his band were used to found the company to further develop and sell market versions of his inventions. Many of the devices were marketed under the Rockman brand. The manufacturing facility was located in Woburn, Massachusetts, in the 1980s. ==History== The \\"Boston guitar sound\\" was the result of Scholz's endless experimentation with guitar amplifiers, microphones, equalizers, and other gear. Modified equipment, which was the result of much of this experimentation, inspired some one-of-a-kind products that Scholz felt other guitarists would find useful. Thus, SR&D; was founded in 1980. In 1982, the company developed and released the Rockman headphone guitar amplifier, designed to allow full amplifier-type sounds to be output through a standard headphone jack, thus allowing musicians to practice through headphones or through a home stereo system. Later on, SR&D; added other signal processing equipment to their product line, notably the Rockmodules, which were half-rack effects that modularized individual components of the Rockman. Guitar amplifiers and other gear were also produced. The Rockman line, which used analog circuits, became less successful during the digital effects boom of the early 1990s, essentially putting the company out of business. Today, some SR&D; products are highly collectible. In 1995, Scholz sold the Rockman line to Dunlop Manufacturing, Inc. and closed SR&D.; ==Products== ===Power Soak=== The first product released by SR&D; was not called a Rockman. It was simply called \\"Tom Scholz's Power Soak\\". The Power Soak is an attenuator, put inline between an amplifier and its speakers. The Power Soak can be used to limit the output level while still maintaining the desired overdriven, saturated sound of an amplifier running at full volume. The first commercial Power Soak was issued at the end of 1980. An updated version of the Power Soak, the Model II, was issued at the end of 1981. It has an extra switch made to adapt the Power Soak to solid-state amplifiers. The Power Soak was re- issued in 1992 as a Power Soak model III, lacking the solid-state switch, though the Power Soak III can be used both with solid-state and tube amps. The jacks were also moved to the back of the unit. ===Headphone amplifiers=== The Rockman brand name was inaugurated with the first of the headphone amplifiers. The original Rockman combined multiple effects, portability, along with quality components and construction. It was marketed as a headphone amplifier but allowed the guitarist to plug directly into the mixer on the stage and in the studio. This effectively made the Rockman a DI unit for many guitarists. An example of this is when Def Leppard used the Rockman in the making of their album Hysteria. ====Rockman==== Rockman amplifier Rockman, top Rockman, front The original Rockman was released in 1982. It includes an amplifier simulator, stereo chorus and echo. It has two clean sounds, along with \\"Edge\\" and distortion modes. The two clean modes are differently EQ'd, \\"Clean 1\\" targets the electric guitar, while \\"Clean 2\\" is recommended for a wider range of use, including acoustic guitar, keyboard and vocals. The \\"Edge\\" setting produces what is described as \\"subtle\\" distortion, that will clean up when playing softly. The chorus and echo are tied together, both being on when the switch was set to normal. The chorus or echo can be disabled, but not both at the same time. The Rockman requires eight AA batteries or an adapter for power. The name 'Rockman' has similarity to Sony's 'Walkman' which had been introduced to the US in 1980, with both devices being breakthroughs in portable stereophonic electronics. ====Rockman Ultralight==== Production of the Rockman Ultralight began in 1983. It was a more economical alternative to the Rockman. It is very similar to the Rockman but lacks the echo. Uniquely, the chorus can be disabled, providing a dry output from the amplifier simulator. Both the original Rockman and Ultralight models were discontinued in 1984. ====X100, Soloist, Bass Rockman==== A new series of Rockman products was introduced in 1984, which included the X100, Soloist and Bass Rockman. These continued to be produced until 1994. The X100 is very similar to the original Rockman in its feature set, but uses a different clipping stage in the amplifier simulation. The Rockman Soloist was positioned as a lower cost Rockman product. It does not have the \\"Clean 2\\" voice. It also has different choices for effects, including a setting for chorus and a \\"stereo\\" setting that has a fixed 25-millisecond delay. It can be set to \\"Mono\\" output, removing all the effects. The Bass Rockman features clean and distortion modes that include chorus. Dry output is available when the chorus switch is set to \\"off\\". There are three EQ presets for what is described as \\"Fat\\", \\"Mid\\" and \\"Bright\\". There is a high frequency clipper, recommended for use with a pick or \\"snapping\\" the strings. There is a high frequency compressor and sustain switch, primarily intended for changing the sustain of the bass in different ways. ====Ace family==== SR&D; Guitar Ace SR&D; Guitar Ace controls Dunlop Rockman Bass Ace Dunlop Rockman Bass Ace controls The Ace family is a much simpler type of Rockman that does not have effects and uses a single 9-volt battery or power supply. The Guitar and Bass Ace were first released in 1990. The Metal Ace was released in 1994. The Guitar Ace and Metal Ace have identical controls, but the Metal Ace is advertised to have a \\"brighter\\" sound. The amplifier distortion is toggled using the \\"cln/dist\\" button. The character of the distortion can be changed with the \\"semi/hvy\\" button. Semi- distortion behaves much like the \\"edge\\" setting is described to, in the Rockman and X100 product. The Bass Ace has the most spartan controls, including mid and treble boost buttons. ====Complete model listing==== The Rockman was originally produced by SR&D.; The Ace family is still produced by Dunlop. SR&D; *Rockman *Ultralight *X100 *Soloist *Bass Rockman *Rockman X100 10th Anniversary *Rockman or X100 with Rockmax modification *Guitar Ace *Metal Ace *Bass Ace Dunlop *Guitar Ace *Metal Ace *Bass Ace ===Rockmodules=== Rockman Sustainor The Rockmodules are a line of professional-quality, rack-mount guitar effects, introduced in 1986. There are roughly three categories of Rockmodules, the amplifier simulators, the sound processors and the control devices. ====Amplifier simulators==== The amplifier simulators include the Sustainor and Distortion Generator. They are the basic building blocks for creating a Rockman system. Systems built from the Sustainor or Distortion Generator are primarily intended for direct connection to a full-range PA system. The Sustainor was first released in 1986. The Sustainor includes a preamp/compressor, a noise gate, distortion and filters, along with a cabinet simulation. Another feature is the auto-clean circuit that allows controlling the guitar distortion by adjusting the guitar volume knob. The Distortion Generator is a related product that was released in 1987. The Distortion Generator includes compression, distortion and cabinet simulation circuitry. Compared to the Sustainor, the Distortion Generator lacks the noise gate and external loop, but includes a three-band pre- distortion EQ. ====Sound processors==== The sound processors include the EQ, Compressor, Smart Gate, Chorus, Echo and Stereo Chorus/Delay. The Stereo Chorus/Delay was released first in 1986. It can be used as either a chorus or delay. The chorus effect can be mono or stereo. The Chorus/Delay is used for doubling, slap-back and reverb-like short echoes. Combining the Stereo Chorus/Delay with a Sustainor provides a complete system for recording guitar. 1987 brought the Instrument EQ, Stereo Echo and Stereo Chorus. The Instrument EQ was specifically designed for use with the Sustainor and Distortion Generator. The EQ frequencies were tailored for use with musical instruments, putting an emphasis on the mid-range frequencies. Its intended place in a Rockmodule lineup is after the Sustainor or Distortion Generator, but before the chorus and echo effects. It can also be used as a pre-distortion EQ, when placed in the Sustainor effects loop. The Rockman Stereo Echo is an analog delay. It can be used to provide \\"slap back\\" echo when no feedback is used. Increasing the delay time and adding feedback provides standard echo effects. It has stereo inputs, or a mono input if only the left input is used. One possible lineup is to put the Stereo Echo after the Stereo Chorus. The Stereo Chorus was introduced in 1987, following the Stereo Chorus/Delay in the Rockmodule lineup. It is a dedicated analog chorus and adds foot-switchable controls for long-chorus and sweep stop. The Rockman Guitar Compressor is a professional quality compressor tailored for use with guitars. Since many of the Rockman products include a compressor (Headphone amps, Sustainor, Distortion Generator, XP Series, Acoustic Guitar Pedal and Ultimatum based products), this effect is primarily intended to add compression when it is not provided by other equipment in the signal chain. The Rockman Smart Gate is a dedicated noise gate that builds on the noise gate technology in the Rockman Sustainor. ====Control devices==== The control devices include the Midi Octopus and Dual Remote Loop. The Midi Octopus is used for controlling other effects. It could be used with a Midi pedal board, or be controlled by a Midi sequencer. The Dual Remote Loop is used to interface effects and amplifiers that can't controlled by other means. ===XP series=== The XP series started in 1989 as a rack-mounted programmable preamplifier called the XPR that was intended for direct connection to a full-range PA system. There is a three- band EQ that allows pre-distortion changes to the EQ. The clean signal can also be mixed with the distorted signal. The distortion is followed by a second 5 band EQ. The effects follow, including a stereo chorus that has a programmable sweep speed, along with a reverb. ====XP 100 combo==== The release of the XPR in 1989 was complemented by the release of the related XP100. The XP100 is a complete amplifier that packages the XPR pre-amplifier with a 2x50-Watt stereo amplifier and 6-inch speakers. The speakers are in a dual enclosure that can be separated. ====1991 models==== 1991 brought a number of XP series products, that were all produced in small numbers. A low- noise update to the XPR was released, called the XPRa. Similarly, the XP100a combo was released as a low-noise version of the XP100. Another combo was released in 1991. Instead of 6-inch speakers like the XP100 and XP100a, 12-inch speakers were installed, in a 2x12 single-cabinet configuration. This product was called the XP212. A head version was also produced, called the Rockman Superhead. It is basically a XP100, without the speakers. Due to the small production numbers, the XPRa, XP100a, XP212 and Superhead are extremely difficult to find in the aftermarket. ===Rockman Guitar Monitor=== The Rockman Guitar Monitor is a Guitar Stack that can be used with the Rockmodules or XPR. It was introduced in 1991. The components include a Rockman PA500 amplifier (a modified Carver PM175 2x250-Watt), up to four linear 3-way cabinets and stage head that provides mounting for the amp, pre-amp and other rack-mount components. ===Studio Series=== The Studio Series consists of two 19-inch rack-mount systems that were both briefly built in 1991. This includes the Pro Bass Rockman and PGE-2 two-channel programmable equalizer. Only around 20 of the Pro Bass Rockman were made. Just ninety-nine PGE-2's were made. ====Pro Bass Rockman==== The Pro Bass includes compression and a 9-band graphic equalizer. A foot-switchable 3-band equalizer can also be used to change the EQ during a performance. It has an onboard stereo chorus, overdrive, tape input, tuner output and headphone output. ====PGE 2==== The PGE 2 is a 1U rack-mount, two-channel, MIDI programmable graphic equalizer. It includes two complete 14 band graphic equalizers and input/output overload indicators. The controls are fully programmable with up to 100 presets. ===Final products=== ====Ultimatum==== The Ultimatum products are based on two distinct clipping stages in series. The first part of the Ultimatum circuit has a compressor, clipping stage and cabinet simulation. A second clipping stage simulates the saturation of a power section in an overdriven tube amplifier. Both the A12-50 combo and Ultimatum distortion generator are based on this circuit. A12-50 combo The A12-50 combo was released in 1993. It is a two- channel (distortion and clean) 1x12 50-Watt mono combo. It lacks the chorus and reverb of the other Rockman products, but provides an effects loop for using external effects. It is probably the most conventional of the Rockman guitar amplifiers. Ultimatum distortion generator The Ultimatum Distortion Generator was introduced in 1994. It was designed primarily for use as a distortion with a standard guitar amplifier. It can also be used as a pre-amplifier for directly connecting a guitar to a mixing console. ====Acoustic guitar pedal==== Rockman Acoustic Guitar Pedal The Acoustic Guitar Pedal was released in 1994, designed for clean guitar work. It is basically a compressor with bass and treble controls. It is intended to make an electric guitar sound more like an acoustic guitar. The Acoustic Guitar Pedal was produced by SR&D; and Dunlop. The SR&D; version can be identified by its grey button. The Dunlop version has a blue button. ==References== ==External links== *RockmanCentral.com: The original \\"go to\\" site about Rockman gear and Boston's use of it *Rockman.fr: all about Rockman.

The nearest urban centres to the mountain are Dinas Mawddwy to the south, Llanymawddwy to the southeast, Llanuwchllyn on the shores of Bala Lake to the north, and Rhydymain to the west. The nearest settlements with around 2,000 people are Bala and Dolgellau. On the eastern slopes of Aran Fawddwy is the small lake named Creiglyn Dyfi, the source of the River Dyfi. Its sister peak is Aran Benllyn at . There is also a middle peak- Erw y Ddafad-ddu.

Unfair dismissal in the United Kingdom is the part of UK labour law that requires fair, just and reasonable treatment by employers in cases where a person's job could be terminated. The Employment Rights Act 1996 regulates this by saying that employees are entitled to a fair reason before being dismissed, based on their capability to do the job, their conduct, whether their position is economically redundant, on grounds of a statute, or some other substantial reason. It is automatically unfair for an employer to dismiss an employee, regardless of length of service, for becoming pregnant, or for having previously asserted certain specified employment rights. Otherwise, an employee must have worked for two years.SI 2012/989 This means an employer only terminates an employee's job lawfully if the employer follows a fair procedure, acts reasonably and has a fair reason. The Employment Tribunal will judge the reasonableness of the employer's decision to dismiss on the standard of a \\"band of reasonable responses\\" assessing whether the employer's decision was one which falls outside the range of reasonable responses of reasonable employers.HSBC Bank plc v Madden (case A1/00/2086) and Foley v Post Office (case A1/99/0746) [2000] ICR 1283, [2000] IRLR 827, Times Law Reports, 17 August 2000. ==History== In 1968, Lord Donovan led the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations. This recommended a statutory system of remedies for unfair dismissal. The recommendation was put into the Industrial Relations Act 1971. Exclusive jurisdiction to hear complaints and give remedies was conferred upon the newly created National Industrial Relations Court. The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 soon replaced the unfair dismissal provisions, as was the National Industrial Relations Court with a system of Industrial Tribunals, since renamed Employment Tribunals. Often a tribunal is composed of one legally qualified Employment Judge (formally a \\"chairperson\\") and two lay members, one from an employee friendly background (e.g. from a trade union) and the other from an employer friendly background. However, more recently straightforward claims, such as unlawful deduction from wages claims, are dealt with by an Employment Judge sitting alone. Unfair dismissal rights were recast in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. The present law is found in the Employment Rights Act 1996. *Ridge v Baldwin [1964] AC 40, Lord Reid propounds the at will employment rule *Malloch v Aberdeen Corp (No 1) [1971] 1 WLR 1578, on the right to be heard before dismissal ==Dismissal== A dismissal may be lawful or wrongful (insufficient notice) at common law. It may or may not involve discrimination under statute. It may be actual (with notice or intention) or constructive (by fundamental breach). It may be fair or unfair under statute. It can be absolutely any combination of these. Accordingly, discrimination, wrongful dismissal and constructive dismissal are best dealt with separately. This article addresses the statutory concept of fairness. *Wrongful dismissal: in particular, a termination by the employer in breach of the employee's contract of employment (in other words a dismissal without notice, where the employer is obliged to give notice) is described as \\"wrongful dismissal\\", and not as unfair dismissal. *Discrimination: Where an employee has grounds to believe that he or she has been discriminated against in being dismissed, the Equality Act 2010 may apply. (The Equality Act 2010 is a consolidating reform which repeals and replaces the Race Relations Act 1976, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975). *Constructive dismissal: Where the employee resigns or terminates his contract (without notice) due to some action on the part of the employer which would entitle the employee to terminate without notice (whether or not the employee actually gives notice), this is known as constructive dismissal. The normal circumstances in which an employee would be so entitled are in cases of a \\"fundamental breach of contract\\" (also known as a \\"repudiatory breach of contract\\") by the employer. ==Substantive fairness== Assuming the employee has proven dismissal, the first stage is to establish what was the reason for dismissal, e.g. was it a potentially fair reason or an automatically unfair reason.Employment Rights Act 1996 s98(1)(2) The burden of proof for this is on the employer.Adams v Derby City Council [1986] IRLR 163 If the employer pleads a potentially fair reason, the burden is on him to prove it.ERA 1996 s98(1) As mentioned above, it would have to be capability or qualifications, conduct, redundancy or statutory requirementsERA 1996 s98(2) or \\"some other substantial reason\\".ERA 1996 s98(1)(b) The second stage is to establish whether the dismissal was reasonable, and that means whether the fair reason was sufficient to be also judged as reasonable.ERA 1996 s98(4) Even if the employer proves a fair reason, it often falls over on procedure when the tribunal looks at whether the decision was reasonable. To be unreasonable though, the employer's conduct would have to be outside the band of reasonable responses of any reasonable employer. Roughly speaking, the conduct is reasonable if some decent employers would have handled it similarly, but unreasonable if no reasonable employer would have handled it the same or the dismissal was not based on an honest and genuine decision on reasonable grounds.St Anne's Board Mill Co Ltd v Brien [1973] ICR 444 The tribunal cannot take account of industrial pressure to sack somebody.ERA 1996 s107 If the employee proves that there could have been a competing reason then the burden shifts back to the employer to prove that their alleged reason was the main one.Maund v Penwith District Council [1984] ICR 143 The reason might not be as the employer said, as they might have been wrong on facts or law, short of evidence, or have been trying to be kind to the employee by dressing up capability as redundancy.Abernethy v Mott, Hay & Anderson [1974] ICR 323 The tribunal can decide the reason was different from what either party claims, as long as it gives the parties the chance to change their case.Hotson v Wisbech Conservative Club [1984] ICR 859 Employers can, at the risk of reducing credibility, plead alternative reasons.Smith v Glasgow City District Council [1989] ICR 176 Where the dismissal was the employee's fault and he knew it, a fake reason given by the employer does not automatically mean unfairness.Clarke v Trimco Group Ltd [1993] ICR 237 To prove the reason, the employer cannot dredge up what it did not know until after the termination, nor can it blame events that happened after termination,W Devis & Sons Ltd v Atkins [1977] ICR 662 although this could all be relevant to the remedy available, e.g. the compensation could be reduced to as low as nil. The employer can, however, take account of what happens between giving notice and termination.Parkinson v March Consulting Ltd [1998] ICR 276 ===Capability and qualifications=== Capability is mainly about ability, which can be affected by aptitude, health or physical or mental qualityERA 1996 s 98(2)(a) \\\\- commonly lack of exams or talent. In others words the employee can't do the job. Incapability has been distinguished from misconduct as being \\"sheer incapability due to an inherent incapacity to function\\".Sutton & Gates (Luton) Ltd v Boxall [1978] ICR 176 The underperforming,Fletcher v St Leonards EAT 1987, EAT 25/87 or unadaptable and inflexibleAbernethy v Mott, Hay and Anderson [1974] ICR 323 employee could be fairly dismissed on ground of capability. For incompetence, the employer must normally give a warning and time to improve unless it can prove the employee already knew what was required.Hollister v National Farmers' Union [1979] ICR 542 If the employee could not have improved then that is not necessarily an excuse not to warn and wait, but could justify a reduction in compensation,Polkey v AE Dayton Ltd [1988] ICR 142 although any reduction in compensation based on allegations that employment would have come to end anyway are subject to the tribunal asking the parties about the probability.Market Force (UK) Ltd v Hunt IRLR 863 If the employee has long service with no complaints or has just had a good appraisal it will take a while for the employer to prove it has given a fair chance of improvement or it may be impossible to prove incompetence. The employee may blame lack of training. If the employer supervises the remedial period too closely, the employee may claim constructive dismissal through bullying. If the employer issued a final written warning and then gave a long time for improvement, the employee may argue it is stale. The employer ideally needs complaints from customers and staff. The qualifications ground will be viewed sceptically by tribunals, as if an employee was good enough to employ for two years to give him unfair dismissal rights, a claim that he is suddenly under-qualified may hint at there being another genuine reason, which would make the dismissal unfair on the grounds that the employee never had the chance to respond to the true reason. Unless the law requires the qualification or the employee lied about having it on his CV, this is not a likely ground for success. Ill health can lead to an employee's incapacity in respect of their employment obligations. Illness is not misconduct so disciplinary procedures are not appropriate means to address employer concerns relating to an employee's ill-health. An employer may be able to end an employment relationship without dismissing an employee where the employee's functionality and capacity to undertake their work has been permanently compromised, however tribunals are wary of cases involving employers claiming to have experienced contractual frustration in preference to making reasonable adjustments required by law and addressing the issues within the framework of existing sickness policies in that organisation. In the case of long term ill health, the employer should try to get medical reports and consult the employeeEast Lindsey District Council v Daubney [1977] ICR 566 and then is entitled to decide how long to wait for recoverySpencer v Paragon Wallpapers Ltd [1977] ICR 301 and whether it can give an alternative job.Merseyside & North Wales Electricity Board v Taylor [1975] ICR 185 If the employee does not give access to medical reports and does not accept alternative work the employer must still give a right of appeal against dismissal, even if it looked inevitable.Foster v Somerset County Council EAT 2003, EAT/0355/03 RN For intermittent absences the employer should consider alternative work, and whether it cannot reassure itself of a recovery time, factor in the percentage of time absent and the effect on colleagues,Lynock v Cereal Packaging Ltd [1988] ICR 670 warn the employee early on what is required and what will happen if not adhered toRolls Royce Ltd v Walpole [1980] IRLR 343 and allow representations,International Sports Co Ltd v Thomson [1980] IRLR 340 and warn the employee when the time has come to stop being absent or lose their job. Because the employer cannot obtain a prognosis for intermittent unrelated absences it can set an acceptable attendance standard and dismiss if it not met.Lynock v Cereal Packaging Ltd A disability discrimination dismissal is not automatically unfair.HJ Heinz Co Ltd v Kenrick [2000] IRLR 144 If the illness is a disability (affects work for over a year) the employer has to make reasonable adjustments, which might mean sick pay, redistributing work, giving him a vacancy, being flexible in hours, etc. There is an implied term that the employer must positively discriminate in favour of the disabled, so the disabled employee must be given priority over other better suited applicants if there is a vacancy for a more suitable job to his disability.Archibald v Fife Council [2004] UKHL 32 In any event, the employer must take care not to unreasonably sabotage the employee's income protection insurance - there is an implied term that the employer will keep a sick employee on the books to keep his insurance going.Aspden v Webbs Poultry and Meat Group (Holdings) Ltd [1996] IRLR 521 If the employer caused the illness, e.g. a nervous breakdown, it may be less reasonable to dismiss, and the employer could end up liable for more compensationEdwards v Governors of Hanson School [2001] IRLR 733 and for a longer time. But any mental illness is dangerous territory for the employer.O'Brien v Prudential Assurance Co Ltd [1979] IRLR 140 Due to Polkey, as with capability, a failure to consult the employee will usually cause an unfair dismissal regardless of whether it would have made any difference - employers cannot just suddenly decide for themselves that an employee is a busted flush. ===Conduct=== Conduct is mainly about willingness, which can be failure to use talent through laziness or carelessness, or misbehaviour. In other words, the employee will not do the job. The intransigent type of inflexible employee, or malingerer, could be fairly dismissed on grounds of conduct, capability or SOSR. Misconduct has been distinguished from incapability as being \\"a failure to exercise to the full such talent as is possessed\\".Sutton & Gates (Luton) Ltd v Boxall Suspicion of a crime is an example of where the employer need only prove it believed guilt as opposed to the employee being found guilty, although an investigation is still needed, even if the crime is against the disciplinary code,John Lewis v Coyne [2001] IRLR 139 but not until before termination - it can be after notice of dismissal.ERA 1996 s98(4) Acquittal makes no difference. Even being charged is sufficient, as if the CPS have decided guilt on the balance of probabilities then the employer is entitled to that safe harbour. However, the employer cannot dismiss based on the employee's legal troubles without giving him the chance to defend himself.Clarke v Trimoco Motor Group Ltd [1993] ICR 237 Employers can undermine their claim that the crime made the employee unsuitable by delaying in acting or allowing him to work his notice. A crime only counts if it means the employee is unsuitable for their work - personal dislike of particular crimes do not count. However, the employee could become unsuitable by virtue of being unable to perform thanks to colleagues not accepting his continued employment - the employer may need unsolicited complaints along this line. Even incest can be insufficient to justify dismissal.Bradshaw v Rugby Portland Cement Co Ltd [1972] IRLR 46 Dishonesty counts more if the job requires honesty, e.g. involves handling cash, third partys' goods, acting as security guard. For example, a shop worker who is caught shoplifting in another shop cannot be trusted.Moore v C&A; Modes [1981] IRLR 71 Hiding a conviction might be grounds, but the problem may be that the employer cannot obtain proof of conviction. Anything less than a prison term of 30 months eventually becomes \\"spent\\" after which an employer is not allowed to dismiss for it nor is the employee obliged to disclose. Tribunals may be dubious of dismissals of long serving employees with a clean HR record on grounds of some minor or irrelevant offence years ago. Imprisonment is not just a pretty good proof of guilt, but can frustrate the contract if for more than a few months, which would bring the contract to an end without the need for procedure or compensation. Being held on remand could justify a short spell of suspension on full pay, but if this is without pay or for too long (more than a few months) it creates a constructive dismissal. The employer may simply be able to say that a court has decided there was sufficient probability of guilt to lock him up and this informed its investigation, justifying dismissal. An employer can be entitled to dismiss multiple employees where it cannot prove who is guiltyParr v Whitbread & Co plc [1990] ICR 427 or to dismiss only some of those guilty based on blameworthiness.Securicor Ltd v Smith [1989] IRLR 356 To dismiss several staff for incompetence because the employer does not know which one is the weakest will usually look arbitrary and could easily show lack of an adequate investigation. It could easily be fair though if safety is at risk meaning damage could be done that cannot be put right with money, for example, somebody forgot to bolt a jumbo jet's windscreen back in place and a pilot is sucked out mid-flight. Summary dismissal may be difficult to justify unless the employee appeared to have been guilty of a clear heinous wrongdoing.Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd Summary dismissal for a first offence can only be fair if gross misconduct, warnings will not work, or the warning was already given. An example of where warnings will not work is where the employee is wedded to a campaign against the employer.Farnborough v Governors of Edinburgh College [1974] IRLR 245 Employers need to distinguish between one-off lapses and dishonesty.Laws Stores Ltd v Oliphant [1978] IRLR 251 Factors in reasonableness can be whether other employees previously guilty of the same were also dismissed, and length of service.Strouthos v London Underground Ltd [2004] IRLR EWCA Civ 402 The employer might try to gild the lily by alleging how often the employee has committed the same outrage before - this could allow the employee to argue that he was allowed to behave the same in the past and so had a reasonable expectation that he would not suddenly be sacked for the latest instalment of the same conduct, that the misconduct was waived or was even acceptable conduct. If an employer suddenly wishes to start laying down the law, it can but has to start with warnings,Hackwood v Seal (Marine) Ltd [1973] IRLR 17 and verbal warnings in the past for others will not be enough to justify picking somebody out for dismissal in the future.Bendall v Paine & Betteridge [1973] IRLR 44 The employee may argue he was not made aware of the rule. Oral distribution of what should be a memo probably will not be enough. Neither will be telling a union but not staff.W Brooks & Son Ltd v Skinner [1984] IRLR 379 If the employer suddenly purports to add a draconian new rule that is not in staff contracts, it may face claims of constructive dismissal. Employers who rely on old unrelated warnings will struggle to prove a new minor offence justifies dismissal. The employer must consider what happened to other employees found guilty of the same and adjust for mitigation.Procter v British Gypsum Ltd [1991] IRLR 7 If the employer blames gross misconduct for summary dismissal, the tribunal may be wary of the risk that misconduct was trumped up to gross misconduct to avoid paying for the notice period. For example, using a company car or phone for personal use may or may not be enough, as dishonesty would need to be proven and even then does not necessarily prove reasonableness.John Lewis plc v Coyne Equally, if the employer complains that the employee has taken to working away from the office, the employee may argue that the employer has acquiesced.Bartholomew v LK Group Ltd [2003] IDS Brief 733 Being under the influence of drugs can be grounds, especially if there is a published policy against it, but an odd case of being drunk will not be enough unless it happened to be accompanied by violence or customer complaint. ACAS have published examples of potentially gross misconduct, including dishonesty, violence, bullying, gross insubordination, gross negligence and bringing the employer into disrepute. The last could be caused by conviction of a crime that affects work through bad publicity.Post Office v Liddiard [2001] EmplLR 784 Putting safety at risk could be enough,Taylor v Alidair [1978] IRLR 82 even just interfering with a safety switch on one machine.Martin v Yorkshire Imperial Metals Ltd [1978] IRLR 440 So would moonlighting on sick leave.Nkengfack v Southwark London Borough Council [2002] IDS Brief 712 Being a drug addict can be sufficient reason for dismissal.Walton v TAC Construction Materials Ltd [1981] IRLR 357 Unprovoked unexpected violence is grounds unless length of service mitigates it - often violence will be provoked by somebody and/or the alleged culprit had a clean record until the outburst or \\"self-defence\\". Downloading porn is sufficient, as is hacking.Denco Ltd v Joinson [1991] IRLR 63 Misusing the internet depends on how much and how inappropriately, and whether there was a policy in place. If there was no policy in place but the conduct was blatant, the dismissal might be unfair but compensation would be reduced to reflect the employee's fault. Borrowing someone's password to access what the employee is entitled to is not enough. Refusal to carry out lawful and reasonable instructions can be enough, unless it effectively changes the employee's job description so much that he can claim the instruction was unreasonable or even amounted to constructive dismissal. The more fundamental the instruction the greater the need for the employee to comply, e.g. the employee must work on a different floor in the same building if asked, but failure to take the rubbish out at the traditional time will not cut it without warnings and frequent re- offending. Even then, a tribunal may suspect that if trivia is being used to dispense with somebody who is presumably useful to the business there must be some hidden agenda. The employee may defeat the allegation by showing that he received conflicting instructions, or if there had been a breach of health and safety he could become a whistleblower making it next to impossible to dismiss him without a settlement. ===Standard of proof for capability or conduct=== For capability or conduct, the employer does not have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the employee is incompetent or badly behaved, merely that based on sufficient evidenceCook v Thomas Linnell & Sons [1977] ICR 770 it honestly believes on reasonable grounds that he is.Alidair Ltd v Taylor [1978] ICR445 In the case of conduct, the employer must also base its belief on a reasonable investigation.Trust Houses Forte Leisure Ltd v Aquilar [1976] IRLR 251 So the employer could fall over at any of the three stages of belief, grounds and investigation,British Home Stores Ltd v Burchell [1980] ICR 303 for all of which it has the burden of proof. Even then, there is the fourth test for the tribunal to decide, but for neither party to prove, of whether dismissal fell within a reasonable range of responses.Boys & Girls Welfare Society v McDonald [1996] IRLR 129 The employer cannot hark back to expired warnings.White v Newsquest (Stourbridge) Ltd EAT 2001, EAT/565/00, EAT/1325/99 ===Redundancy=== Redundancy is a topic in itself and there are regulations for where over 20 staff are at risk, whereby unions or employee representatives have also to be consulted. There are, however, always minimum requirements for consultation, selection and alternative employment. Redundancy means either the job has gone, the place has gone or the requirement for employees to do work of a particular kind has reduced. It does not necessarily mean the employee's work has reduced, nor does it mean the amount of anyone else's work has reduced - the employer may simply have found an efficiency that allows the same work to be done by fewer staff. A business reorganisation might or might not also be a redundancy - a mere reshuffle is not a redundancy.Aylward v Glamorgan Holiday Hotel EAT 2003 If the employer honestly believes there is no redundancy then the reason must be something else. ====Bumping==== It is established practice that \\"bumping\\" may be fair. This means making one employee redundant to save another's job, typically on a last-in-first-out (\\"LIFO\\") basis. But the employer has no duty to do soBryne v Arvin Meritor LVS (UK) Ltd EAT 2003, EAT 239/02 and the bumped employee may succeed in a claim for unfair dismissal. ====Sham redundancies==== Employers might want to dress up a redundancy as a business reorganisation to circumvent disciplinary procedure (e.g. right to be accompanied),Heathmill Multimedia ASP Ltd v Jones [2003] IRLR 856 consultation, paid time off and redundancy payments. Employers may want to save face for both parties where the real ground is conductAmor v Galliard Homes Ltd [2002] IDS Brief 702 that was not addressed in time, capability that is difficult to prove, pregnancyHill v Tripath Ltd [2002] EmpLR 79, ET/3300778/01 or the hope simply that somebody who does not figure in future plans will grab an enhanced redundancy payment and run. In such a case it will be hard to overturn the employer's claim of redundancy, but a genuine redundancy can still be unfair dismissal. Even if there is a genuine redundancy, the dismissal must be handled fairly.Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd [1982] ICR 156 ====Time off during notice of redundancy==== An employee given notice of redundancy is entitled to 40% of paid time off for jobseeking or retraining. Combined with unused holiday, the employee may effectively therefore be able to disappear once the clock starts ticking. Any attempt to make it difficult to take holiday or jobseeking opportunities at that vulnerable time may not look like a reasonable employer. ====Consultation==== In a redundancy situation the employer must consultMugford v Midland Bank [1997] IRLR 208 those in the \\"pool\\" identified at risk and carry out a fair selection. The consultation must start when the employer decidesDewhirst Group v GMB Trade Union [2003] IDS Brief 747 or proposesMSF v Refuge Assurance plc [2002] IRLR 324 redundancy - any delay could entitle the employee to compensation for loss of jobseeking time.Ekouil v Coney Island Ltd [2002] IRLR 174 Depending on size of firm and how many redundancies are proposed, it may need to include ways of avoiding redundancies, saving jobs and mitigating effects of redundancy. It certainly has to be while proposals are formative, give adequate information and time, and give conscientious consideration. ====Selection==== The selection used to often hinge on length of service, which could be fair on its own,Blatchfords Solicitors v Berger [2001] EmpLR 74 but as that is now age discrimination it may have to be based on more objective performance measures. ====Alternative employment==== The employer should refer the employee to any reasonable alternative employment in the group.Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Offering a reasonable alternative job which is not taken can defeat a claim for unfair dismissal, but the redundancy payment will still be due unless the job was suitable. The test is whether it is subjectively suitable for the employee, so it is easy for him to prove he did not need to accept it. Confusingly, a \\"reasonable alternative\\" is a job the employee could do, whereas a \\"suitable alternative\\" tends to be a sub-set of reasonable jobs, meaning one that would be reasonable for him to do. The job will tend not to be suitable if it involves more hours for the same pay,O'Connor v Montrose Canned Foods Ltd [1966] 1 ITR 171 the same hours for less pay,Taylor v Kent County Council [1969] 2 QB 560 a substantially longer commuteBass Leisure Ltd v Thomas [1994] IRLR 104 (unless the employee refuses to view the locationDouce v F Bond & Sons Ltd [1966] 1 ITR 365), less status or responsibilities, or insufficient time is given to decide.Barratt v Thomas Glover & Co Ltd [1970] 5 ITR 95 ====Misconduct during redundancy notice==== An employer could avoid a redundancy payment by dismissing for misconduct during the notice period, but only for a repudiatory breach, which effectively means the employee would have acted as if he has torn up the employment contract, e.g. by going on strike, emptying the company safe or punching out the managing director. ====Dual claim - unfair redundancy==== If the employee claims redundancy at the same time then the burden of proving redundancy is on the employee.Employment Tribunals Act 1996 s7(6) If the claim was for redundancy and not unfair dismissal then the burden would be on the employer to disprove redundancy.ERA 1996 s163(2) ===Statutory requirements=== Statutory requirements could, for example, be a lorry driver losing his driving licence. However, although it could be a fair reason, the employer still has to decide reasonably,Sandhu v Department of Education & Science and London Borough of Hillingdon [1978] IRLR 208; Sutcliffe and Eaton Ltd v Pinney [1977] IRLR 349 so automatic sacking may not be the answer - maybe the driver could take a pay cut to help in the office until he gets a new licence. A mistaken belief as to a statutory reason is not grounds, but could be \\"some other substantial reason\\" below.Bouchaala v Trust House Forte Hotels [1980] IRLR 382 ===\\"Some other substantial reason\\"=== Some other substantial reason (\\"SOSR\\") is a kind of catch-allRS Components Ltd v Irwin [1973] ICR 535 that employers use to justify dismissal. It is usually a business reorganisation or contract change that the employee refuses to consent to. Despite it looking like a \\"get out of jail card\\" for employers, tribunals will be alert to employers using SOSR as a pretext for managing somebody out whose face does not fit.Labour Party v Oakley [1988] ICR 403 All the employer has to show is a potentialKerry Foods Ltd v Lynch [2005] IRLR 680 good sound business reason.Hollister v National Farmers' Union ====Common law grounds==== Common law examples are imminent defection to competitor,Davidson v Comparisons [1980] IRLR 360 unreasonable refusal to agree a contract change,Genower v Ealing, Hammersmith & Hounslow Area Health Authority [1980] IRLR 297 going AWOL,White v Bristol Rugby Ltd [2002] IRLR 205 repeated complaints of constructive dismissal without resignation,Brown v Tomlinsons Dairies damaging breakdown in relations caused by the employee,Perkins v St George's Healthcare Trust [2005] IRLR 934 threats to resign followed by ambiguous absence,Ely v YKK Fasteners (UK) Ltd [1994] ICR 164 imprisonment,Kingston v British Railways Board [1984] ICR 781 expiry of fixed termNorth Yorkshire County Council v Fay [1986] ICR 133 and pressure from a customer or supplier.Scott Packing v Paterson [1978] IRLR 166 If the breakdown in relations could have been caused by several staff then all must be given warnings and eventually all may have to be dismissed if one culprit cannot fairly be singled out.Monie v Coral Racing Ltd [1980] ICR 109 If a customer demands a dismissal, the impact on the employer of keeping the employee needs to outweigh the impact on the employee of the dismissal. If a supplier demands a dismissal, the employer needs to weigh up the cost of going elsewhere. The employer should always consider a transfer to another department. ====Statutory grounds==== Statutory categories are employees drafted in to cover for pregnancy or sickness,ERA 1996 s106 and TUPE economic, technical or organisational changes (when a firm is taken over).Thompson v SCS Consulting Ltd [2001] IRLR 801 ====Changing terms==== If the employer wants employees to sign a new contract, it might be relevant whether it paid for legal advice or gave time to think, and certainly the issues are wider than just looking at the terms of the new draft contract.St John of God (Care Services) Ltd v Brooks [1992] ICR 715 To secure consent to a change, the employer needs to pay for it, e.g. using a salary review. ==Procedural fairness== In addition to having a valid substantive reason to dismiss an employee, for a dismissal to be legal, the employer should be able to show that the procedure followed to dismiss the employee was procedurally fair. The requirement for procedural fairness was introduced by the Lords in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd.[1987] UKHL 8 In 2002, the Employment Rights Act 1996 was amended to give a statutory basis to procedural fairness‚Äîfollowing a public consultation, this was repealed in 2008 and the law reverted to Polkey.Explanatory Note on Section 2 of the Employment Act 2008 ===Warnings=== A classic error is not giving the employee warnings,Tower Hamlets Health Authority v Anthony [1989] ICR 656 disciplinary rules,Lock v Cardiff Railway Co Ltd [1998] IRLR 358 details of the allegations,Coxon v Rank Xerox (UK) Ltd [2003] ICR 628 the right of appealWest Midlands Co-operative Society Ltd v Tipton [1986] ICR 192 or to be accompanied at a dismissal hearing,Employment Rights Act 1999 s10 alternative employment options before termination subject to the group's size,P v Nottinghamshire County Council [1992] ICR 706 or the chance to improve. Large employers will be expected to be professional. A re- hearing can rectify an unfair dismissal.Whitbread & Co plc v Mills [1988] ICR 776 ===Statement of reasons=== The employee is entitled to receive within 14 days a written statement of reasons for dismissal.ERA 1996 s 92 The employer can comply by saying anything it believes. A missing, inadequate or untrue statement is itself grounds for a complaint to tribunal.ERA 1996 s 93 The tribunal can then make its mind up as to the reason for dismissal and will award two weeks' pay for this procedural breach.ERA 1996 s 93(2) The employee can use the statement to block the employer from changing the reason in its defence to a claim or to attack its credibility if there is such a change. ===Investigations=== Investigations must result in notes being kept and given to the employee.Vauxhall Motors Ltd v Ghafoor [1993] ICR 376 They cannot just consist of uncorroborated anonymous informants;Linfood Cash and Carry Ltd v Thomson [1989] ICR 518 sometimes the employee will be entitled to know his accusers and the accusations,A v Company B Ltd [1997] IRLR 405Louies v Coventry Hood & Seating Co Ltd [1990] ICR 54 although the employee is not entitled to know everything as long as he knows the accusation.Hussain v Elonex plc [1999] IRLR 420 Anonymous accusers are easy to attack anyway as there may be questions around grudges, ability to have seen what they say they saw and how they remember details. An employee is rarely entitled to cross- examine accusers.Ulsterbus Ltd v Henderson [1989] IRLR 251Santamera v Express Cargo Forwarding t/a IEC Ltd [2003] IRLR 273 A confession could still leave a dismissal unfair if the disciplinary procedure was defective, in fact the employer must always follow a fair procedure before dismissal for misconduct.Whitbread plc (t/a Whitbread Medway Inns) v Hall [2001] IRLR 275 If the employee is a trade union official the employer must consult a senior union leader, otherwise unfair dismissal is likely and there may easily be a suspicion that charges were trumped up. If a decision maker is a witness that may make dismissal unfair.Moyes v Hylton Castle Working Mens Social Club and Institute Ltd [1986] IRLR 482 ==Remedies== Claims of unfair dismissal can only be brought before an employment tribunal. There are strict and very short time limits for claims of unfair dismissal. Normally a claim must be brought within three months of the last day of employment, counting the last day of employment as the first day of the three-month period.Section 111(2)(a) Employment Rights Act 1996 This rule is often summarised as \\"three months less a day\\". The claim must be lodged using the prescribed form ET1 which can be obtained from the Employment Tribunals Service. Employees may bring such claims themselves, either with or without representation. Solicitors and certain other representatives regulated by the Ministry of Justice may represent employees in Employment Tribunal proceedings. Trade unions may support employees' claims, and independent arbitration and conciliation services may be called upon. If the tribunal finds unfair dismissal it can order re-instatement (old job back) or re-engagement (new job), and/or compensation. ===Compensation=== Compensation mainly consists of a \\"basic award\\" equivalent to statutory redundancy pay of, as at 2009, up to ¬£10,500, plus a \\"compensatory award\\" for loss of earnings, statutory rights and benefits and for expenses, of up to ¬£66,200, or unlimited where the dismissal was due to health and safety, whistleblowing or union work. So even in an accidental unfair dismissal, the employer could be ordered to pay up to ¬£76,700. If the employee adds a claim for breach of contract, up to a further ¬£25,000 could be awarded, taking the total potential compensation to ¬£101,700. Note that the 'Polkey deduction' principle applies: just because an employee has successfully claimed unfair dismissal does NOT mean that they will receive the full Compensatory award. It may be reduced to reflect the likelihood that there would have been a fair dismissal even if a fair process had been fully followed. On the principle that an employee should not be compensated over and above what is an actual reflection of their loss.Adviceforemployers.co.uk Unfair dismissal compensation Polkey deductions The Polkey deduction is so named due to a court case: Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd, and was clarified more recently at the 2013 appeal case for Contract Bottling v Cave.Contract Bottling v Cave Bailii.org ====Risk factors==== Mainly though, the compensatory award depends on what the employee earned before it all went wrong, and how long they will take to get back similarly paid work. Factoring in the smaller basic award, the nightmare scenario in a tribunal for the employer is therefore ruining a 41-year-old high flier's career after they have been with them for 20 years. \\"Big money\\" cases tend to be restricted to discrimination, where the tribunal's unfair dismissal cap is lifted, or breach of contract or psychiatric injury, where there is no limit to what can be claimed in court. So a worst-case scenario overall for the employer is not just ruining a high flier's career, but a man doing so by bullying a woman and giving her a nervous breakdown. Compensation tends to roughly double in disability or race discrimination cases, so it can be even worse. ====Tribunal statistics==== The reality of tribunals is that the average award of ¬£4,000 does not cover the time and money spent by the employee on the claim, and consequently the employer - who also spends about ¬£5,000 on legal fees - usually merely avoids paying less than it loses on lawyers, publicity, management time and staff penning witness statements and testifying.Employmenttribunals.gov.uk It is generally in both parties' interests to settle. The risks of being sucked into a tribunal are real - 40,000 unfair dismissal cases are heard every year. 69% of claims are settled; of the other 31%, 19% are thrown out and 12% win. So claimants may be aware they have an 81% chance of extracting some cash. 31% of cases that proceed to a full hearing result in compensation. The median award is ¬£4,000 and mean is ¬£8,058. Costs are awarded to employers in fewer than 0.2% of cases and to employees in fewer than 0.1% of cases, and average a median of ¬£1,000 and mean of ¬£2,095. Three quarters of claimants are represented. ====Factors for & against settling==== However, the employer may worry that compromising undermines the decision to dismiss and thus the authority of management, or that it would create a precedent for everyone who leaves to demand \\"a bit extra to go quietly\\". The employee may simply want his day in court. The employer may have little economic option but to offer a few months' wages ex gratia to get rid of the nuisance. It often costs that anyway to keep a disgruntled employee whilst working through grievances and disciplinary hearings, sometimes dragged out even longer by sick leave, so two months' wages is not really an \\"extra\\" cost. By offering an apology, a good reference, tax-free lump sum and avoidance of the time and cost and risk of losing, the employer may persuade the employee to make a similarly economic decision to drop the claim, sign a compromise agreement and clear his desk. It can be essential that the employee feels the employer has lost - hence the apology and payment. Winning a tribunal case is rarely an economic \\"win\\" - the parties being able to move on with their lives and business is more likely to be such an optimum economic outcome. ===Employer's tactics=== * The claimant may have named the wrong person as employer and ended up missing the three-month deadline by the time he realises. * The claimant may not be able to afford a lawyer, whereas the employer may be insured. * The claimant may have not exhausted the grievance procedure. * The claimant may have missed the three- month deadline. * The employer could offer the claimant a new job to try to stop the clock ticking on liability for loss of earnings (not likely to work if unsuitable or amounting to an invitation to work in a hostile environment). * The claim may on the face of it have little prospect of success, enabling the employer to apply for a pre-hearing review which may result in the claimant having to pay a deposit of up to ¬£1,000. Only one third of such claimants continue their claim. This helps stamp out timewasters or to negotiate a lower settlement, but if used frivolously will simply leave the employer with a claimant who thinks he is on a winner and so will cost more to settle. * The employer can ask questions in advance via the tribunal, to hopefully expose lacking evidence. * Whoever calls a witness cannot cross- examine him. So the employer may prefer to sit back and let the claimant call witnesses. * The employer can offer the claimant a settlement that gives him some of the savings he would make by avoiding recoupment of social security from an award. * The employer can make a \\"Calderbank\\" offer - a without prejudice letter warning that the employer thinks the claim is inflated and that costs will be sought if it wins, and offering a sum to settle, which if the employee fails to beat in his award, entitles the tribunal to consider whether refusal of the offer was unreasonable and therefore costs could be awarded against the employee. * The employer can offer the claimant a good reference to be agreed in a compromise agreement in return for accepting a relatively small sum to drop the claim. * The claimant may have failed to mitigate his loss by not jobseeking enough. * The employee may be unable to bring a claim due to illegality, but the employer will probably come off worst from such allegations. For example, the employee may have no right to workSharma v Trustees and Executive Committee Members for the time being of the Hindu Cultural Society Slough EAT 1990, EAT/253/90 or may be not paying the right taxBeauvale Furnishings Ltd v Chapman [2001] IRLR 670 \\\\- the first person to be fined for that will be the employer, and the publicity of hiring illegal workers or implication in tax scams may be scant reward for trying to kill off a small claim. * Most importantly, the employer might consider the motivation for a claim. Does the employee really think he will win enough money to make it worth the hassle? Or does he want to punish the employer for the way he thinks he was treated. It may be that a without prejudice apology is worth thousands of pounds. ===Employee's tactics=== * The employer may have used an employment consultant as opposed to a lawyer, in which case the claimant can demand copies of letters between them, which could devastate the defence. * The employer may have missed a deadline or omitted a procedural step. * The claimant can request an order for production of documents from the employer, even confidential ones are fair game - if the employer protests the tribunal can look at them privately to decide whether to give them to the claimant. * The claimant can tie up a large proportion of staff with requests for witnesses. ===Avoiding a tribunal hearing=== ;Settlement Agreements The Settlement Agreement is a new concept that replaces the former \\"Compromise Agreement\\". Section 111A(2) of the ERA 1996 (as amended) provides for \\"Pre- termination Negotiations\\" that are: \\"any offers made or discussions held, before the termination of the employment in question, vita a view to it being terminated on terms agreed between the employer and the employee\\". The new provisions, which came into force on 29 July 2013, allows an employer to seek agreement with an employee for the latter's dismissal, thereby avoiding any risk of tribunal litigation for wrongful or unfair dismissal. The employee is invited to attend a meeting and may bring a companion (a fellow employee or a trade union officer). The employer, having discussed the issues, can make a written offer of termination, and the employee should be given 10 days to consider. The negotiations are confidential and \\"without prejudice\\". A Settlement Agreement is enforceable, but the employer is advised to have a \\"clawback\\" clause to allow recovery of any termination sums paid should evidence of misdeeds by the employee later arise. The discussions must observe ACAS Code of Practice 4 guidelines on settlement agreements; failure to comply may amount to \\"improper behaviour\\" by the employer, allowing the employee to renege on the agreement. ==Conflicts of laws== *Serco Ltd v Lawson [2006] UKHL 3, a UK labour law case concerning the jurisdictional application of employment rights. *Duncombe v Department for Education and Skills [2011] UKSC 36, teachers employed by the British government, under contracts governed by English law, to work in EU schools abroad were protected under ERA 1996 s 94 ==See also== *Employment Rights Act 1996 *Unfair dismissal *WorkChoices *Wrongful dismissal *Redfearn v United Kingdom [2012] ECHR 1878 *Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, Part 2 *Orr v Milton Keynes Council [2011] EWCA Civ 62, Aikens LJ, band of reasonable responses means asking what a \\"hypothetical reasonable employer\\" would do *Turner v East Midlands Trains Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 1470, Elias LJ the band of reasonable responsible test would be compatible with HRA 1998 s 3 and ECHR article 8, if it had been engaged.

The Fanhunter universe combines subcultural elements from comics, science fiction, role playing games, action films... with bizarre parody characters from the Spanish comics scene (comicbooks mailings, meetings, specialized libraries and stores...) acting as constant conspiratorial wink to its target audience. Characters are mostly inspired in real-life people who are important for the Spanish comic-book and subculture community, and also in fictional characters easily referenced. Alejo Cuervo, for instance, is a real- life publisher who is in good terms with author Pi√±ol, and the Fanhunters were initially a parody of DC Comics characters Manhunters. ==Fanhunter story== (Main theme from The A-Team): In 1996, in the city of Barcelona, Alejo Cuervo (an insane ex-librarian who thinks he is possessed by the spirit of Philip K. Dick), proclaims himself as the new Pope Alejo I (killing the old one blowing up the Vatican City), submitting (& bribing some governments) all of Europe to the boring \\"Dick's Rule\\" by forbidding almost any form of subculture (video games, comics, DVDs, Roleplaying games, hopscotch) allowing just what he likes: religious music, Breakfast at Tiffany's and the works of Philip K. Dick: \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Blade Runner\\"... Alejo I decided to create a special force, the Fanhunters, and use the cloned soldiers Tintin Macute (not so intelligent) to annihilate the civilians who still resist: otakus, gamers, comic fans and geeks left in Europe. Barcelona is renamed as Barnacity, being the capital of Europe, now renamed Europe of Dick. To defend themselves, the rebels created a group \\"The Resistance\\" to fight against Pope Alejo I and his evil forces. Many fans organised to defend their ideals and lifestyle, stopping the destruction of imagination that moves the World, using their knowledge of movie, comics, TV shows, books like \\"V\\", \\"Mash\\", \\"Konstantin\\", \\"The A-Team\\" o \\"The Rock\\". \\"The Resistance\\", with the help of Nick Fury & the Federated Planets Federation, fought Alejo I in Barnacity: it was the 1st Battle of Montju√Øc. 90% of the fans died, but Alejo was defeated & auto-exiled himself. Everyone was happy, tyranny was defeated. But... Juan Krieg took over, installing a regime of terror. An agent of the (former) British M-16 (now renamed the Royal British Resistance, RBR for friends & foes), Reuben Hood, unmasked Krieg: this guy cheated in the D&D; Tournament with loaded dice. Alejo I returned (after escaping from a Turkish jail, but this is another story). Alejo I is a Fenicius, a creature who enlarges its lifespan by selling (or negotiating). It is said that he lived from the ancient times of Carthago, being the founder of Fenice. In the 20th Century, selling books and comics in his own Book Shop, he was converted in follower of Philip K. Dick (Sci-Fi writer and Fanknight Warrior of the Light Side of the Pichurrina). When Dick died, murdered by Loki, (Nordic God and Fanknight Warrior of the Dark Side of the Pichurrina) Alejo absorbed part of Dick's Fanknight power and got insane, being used by the forces of the Dark Side of the Pichurrina. The plot is mainly focused on the fight facts after 2008. ==Comic== The Fanhunter comics tells the story about the fight against Alejo and the remaining heroes. Fanhunter is a bizarre saga. It started as a self-edited fanzine, and his creator-artist-writer Cels Pi√±ol, personally distribute it himself among the comic book shops. As time goes by, its popularity rises, and then becomes a nationwide phenomenon, and nowadays it went outside the Spanish frontiers attracting the interest of the Southamerican readers. Graphically limited (simple, but effective artwork), Cels Pi√±ol attracted the attention of thousands of readers who are identified with his comics, games, characters and concepts. The humoristic world of the future that Fanhunter reflects, where everything related with comic books, Internet, videogames, role-playing games and other expressions of leisure are forbidden, is a subtle and intelligent reflexion about the dangers of totalitarian regimes, intolerance an fundamentalism. In the world created by Cels, the true heroes are those comic readers, disk-jockeys, web surfers, role-players, Movie fans, videogame players, and TV lovers with their sub-cultural knowledge treasured during years make them fight against the forces of evil. They are the last line of defense.Translated from the novel Fanhunter: Herencia ==Role-playing game== The Fanhunter role-playing game (in Spanish Fanhunter, el juego de rol √©picodecadente, for Fanhunter, the epic decadent role-playing game) lets the player enter the bizarre world of Fanhunter and command the people of the Fanhunter world, which are named Narizones because of their big nose. == See also == * Fanhunter, el juego de rol √©picodecadente ==References== ==External links== * Category:Spanish comics titles Category:Barcelona in fiction Category:1989 comics debuts Category:Spanish comics Category:Science fiction comics ","title":"Fanhunter"},{"id":"1433917","text":"Judith Scott (May 1, 1943 - March 15, 2005) was an internationally renowned American fiber sculptor. Judith was born into a middle-class family in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1943 along with her fraternal twin sister Joyce. Unlike Joyce, Judith was born with Down Syndrome. During her infancy, Judith suffered from Scarlet Fever, which caused her to lose her hearing, a fact that remained unknown until much later on in her life. At the age of seven, she was sent to an Ohio state institution where she remained until her sister became her guardian 35 years later. In 1987 Judith was enrolled at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, California which supports people with developmental disabilities.\\"Entwined: Sisters and Secrets in the Silent World of Artist Judith Scott\\" Beacon Press, Boston There, Judith discovered her passion and talent for abstract fiber art. An account of Scott's life, Entwined ‚Äì Sisters and secrets in the life of artist Judith Scott has been written by her twin sister. ==Upbringing== Judith Scott spent her first seven and a half years at home with her parents, twin sister and older brothers. Although the developmental gap between the two girls was apparent, \\"the parents consciously sought to treat these youngest members of the family alike.\\"Joyce Wallace Scott: \\"Entwined:Sisters and Secrets in the Silent World of Artist Judith Scot\\" Beacon Press, Boston However, when it was time for the girls to start attending school, Judith was found to be \\"ineducable.\\" There was only one classroom for children with disabilities, and Judith was not able to pass the verbally-based entrance tests, due to her still undiagnosed deafness. Consequently, on medical advice, her parents placed Judith in the Columbus State Institution (formerly the Columbus State School), an institution for the mentally disabled, on October 18, 1950. This separation had a profound effect on both twins. The records from Judith Scott's first few years at the Institution indicate that she had an IQ of 30 (based upon oral testing before her deafness was recognized). For this reason she was denied any training opportunities. Deprived of her twin, Judith became severely alienated, and behavioral problems soon surfaced. Her Clinical Record states that \\"She does not seem to be in good contact with her environment. She does not get along well with other children, is restless, eats messily, tears her clothing, and beats other children. Her presence on the ward is a disturbing influence.\\" Soon after, she was moved to a smaller state institution at Gallipolis, Ohio. In 1985, after 35 years of complete separation and lengthy and difficult negotiations, Joyce Scott became her sister's legal guardian, and brought Judith to live with her in California, a state where all mentally disabled citizens are entitled to an ongoing education. Judith Scott died of natural causes at her sister's home in Dutch Flat, California, a few weeks short of her 62nd birthday. She outlived her life expectancy at birth by almost fifty years. ==Art== On April 1, 1987, Judith Scott began attending the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, one of the first organizations in the world to provide studio space for artists with disabilities. For almost two years, Judith showed little interest in any artistic activity. She was unexceptional with paint. She scribbled loops and circles, but her work contained no representational imagery, and she was so uninterested in creating that the staff was considering ending her involvement with the program. It wasn't until Judith casually observed a fiber art class conducted by visiting artist Sylvia Seventy, that she had her artistic breakthrough. Using the materials at hand, Judith spontaneously invented her own unique and radically different form of artistic expression. While other students were stitching, she was sculpting with an unprecedented zeal and concentration. Her creative gifts and absolute focus were quickly recognized, and she was given complete freedom to choose her own materials. Taking whatever objects she found, regardless of ownership, she would wrap them in carefully selected colored yarns to create diverse sculptures of many different shapes. Some resemble cocoons or body parts, while others are elongated totemic poles. Many of her works also feature pairs, reflecting Scott's experience as a twin. Judith worked on her art five days a week for eighteen years, producing over 200 pieces in total. Judith had her first exhibition in 1999, which coincided with the publication of John MacGregor's book Metamorphosis: The Fiber Art of Judith Scott. Together, these events helped propel her to worldwide recognition. Scott's work has become immensely popular in the world of outsider art, and her pieces sell for substantial sums.Artist Emerges With Works in a 'Private Language', by Evelyn Nieves, New York Times, June 25, 2001 Scott is now hailed as a contemporary artist, no longer just an outsider.\\"Judith Scott - Bound and Unbound\\" Brooklyn Museum, 2015 Her art is held in the permanent collections of many museums, including: Museum of Modern Art (Manhattan, New York), the American Visionary Art Museum (Baltimore, Maryland), Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA, Museum of American Folk Art (Manhattan, New York), Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art (Chicago, Illinois), Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, The Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA.

(What's under your hat?) about Scott and Philippe Lespinasse released Les cocons magiques de Judith Scott, a documentary filmed a few weeks before Scott's death.

Pattis in his book Karel The Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming. Pattis used the language in his courses at Stanford University, California. The language is named after Karel ƒåapek, a Czech writer who introduced the word robot. ==Principles== A program in Karel is used to control a simple robot named Karel that lives in an environment consisting of a grid of streets (left-right) and avenues (up-down). Karel understands five basic instructions: \`move\` (Karel moves by one square in the direction he is facing), \`turnLeft\` (Karel turns 90 ¬∞ left), \`putBeeper\` (Karel puts a beeper on the square he is standing at), \`pickBeeper\` (Karel lifts a beeper off the square he is standing at), and \`turnoff\` (Karel switches himself off, the program ends). Karel can also perform boolean queries about his immediate environment, asking whether there is a beeper where he is standing, whether there are barriers next to him, and about the direction he is facing. A programmer can create additional instructions by defining them in terms of the five basic instructions, and by using conditional control flow statements \`if\` and \`while\` with environment queries, and by using the \`iterate\` construct. ==Variants and descendants== The language has inspired the development of various clones and similar educational languages. As the language is intended for beginners, localized variants exist in some languages, notably Czech (the programming language was quite popular in Czechoslovakia). The principles of Karel were updated to the object-oriented programming paradigm in a new programming language called Karel++. Karel++ is conceptually based on Karel, but uses a completely new syntax, similar to Java. A REALbasic implementation, rbKarel,https://code.google.com/p/rbstuff/wiki/rbKarelOverview provides the basic Karel commands within an RBScript environment with BASIC syntax being used for loops and conditionals. This teaching project provides a cross- platform GUI for Karel experiments including single-stepping and spoken output. A Karel-inspired language and environment called Robot Emilhttp://www.emil.input.sk/info_en.htm uses a 3D view of the robot's world. Robot Emil offers a large palette of objects that can be placed to depict walls, windows (transparency), water and grass. The camera may be moved freely throughout the 3D environment. The robot may be controlled interactively with buttons in the GUI, or by programs written in Emil's Karel-like programming language. The author states that the program is free for use by schools, students and children. Versions are available in English, Czech and Slovak. A proprietary language which is also called Karel is used to program the robots of FANUC Robotics. However, FANUC Karel is derived from Pascal. The language has also been implemented as Karel the Dog in JavaScript by CodeHS. Similar to the original language, this implementation features Karel in a grid world. Programmers use and build upon Karel's simple vocabulary of commands to accomplish programming tasks. Instead of putting and picking beepers, Karel the Dog puts and takes tennis balls. == See also == * Educational programming language * RoboMind - An attractive, educational alternative programming environment * RUR-PLE - another \\"learn Python\\" tool based on ideas in Karel * CodeHS - introductory computer science education using Karel in JavaScript == Further reading == * Richard E.

The Egyptological term is derived from , which replaced earlier , perhaps the nisba of \\"Persea tree\\". Ushabtis were placed in tombs among the grave goods and were intended to act as servants or minions for the deceased, should they be called upon to do manual labor in the afterlife. The figurines frequently carried a hoe on their shoulder and a basket on their backs, implying they were intended to farm for the deceased. They were usually written on by the use of hieroglyphs typically found on the legs. They carried inscriptions asserting their readiness to answer the gods' summons to work.ushabti. (2003). In The Macmillan Encyclopedia. The practice of using ushabtis originated in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2600 to 2100 BCE), with the use of life-sized reserve heads made from limestone, which were buried with the mummy.Taylor, Richard. \\"SHABTI (USHABTI, SHAWABTI).\\" Death and the Afterlife: a cultural encyclopedia. California: 2000. Most ushabtis were of minor size, and many produced in multiples ‚Äì they sometimes covered the floor around a sarcophagus. Exceptional ushabtis are of larger size, or produced as a one-of-a-kind master work. Due to the ushabti's commonness through all Egyptian time periods, and world museums' desire to represent ancient Egyptian art objects, the ushabti is one of the most commonly represented objects in Egyptology displays. Produced in huge numbers, ushabtis, along with scarabs, are the most numerous of all ancient Egyptian antiquities to survive. ==Etymology and usage of the terms== The term shabti applies to these figures prior to the Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt, but only after the end of the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181‚Äì2055 BCE), and really only to those figurines inscribed with Chapter Six of the Book of the Dead. Otherwise, they might better be defined by the generic term \\"funerary figurines\\". Shabtis were servant figures that carried out the tasks required of the deceased in the underworld. It was necessary for the owner's name to be inscribed on an ushabti, along with a phrase sending them to action, written in the hieratic script.Taylor, Richard. \\"SHABTI (USHABTI, SHAWABTI).\\" Death and the Afterlife: a cultural encyclopedia. California: 2000. The shawabti were a distinct class of funerary figurines within the area of Thebes during the New Kingdom. The term ushabti became prevalent after the 21st Dynasty and remained in use until the Ptolemaic Kingdom. It is thought by some that the term ushabti meant \\"follower\\" or \\"answerer\\" in Ancient Egyptian, because the figurine \\"answered\\" for the deceased person and performed all the routine chores of daily life for its master in the afterlife that the gods had planned for them,Brier, op. cit., p.186 although it would be difficult to reconcile this derivation with the form shawabti.Wendy Doniger, Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, Merriam-Webster 1999, p.1121 ==Inscriptions== Ushabti inscriptions often contain the 6th chapter of the Book of the Dead, translated as: (Example: the deceased Ramses would have been described as \\"Osiris Ramses\\"). In rare cases different chapters of the Book of the Dead are written. Furthermore, ushabtis often mention the name and the titles of the owner, without the spells of the Book of the Dead. Before being inscribed on funerary figurines, the spell was written on some mid-Twelfth Dynasty coffins from Deir el-Bersha (about 1850 BC) and is known today as spell 472 of the Coffin Texts.Coffin Text 472 in A. Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs: An Introduction, p.32 An ushabti box at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum ==History of usage== Mentioned first in spell 472 of the Coffin Texts, they were included in the grave goods of the dead as small figurines since the reign of Mentuhotep II of the 11th Dynasty.Ian Shaw, The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press 2003, p.170 Some think that originally they may have symbolically replaced human sacrificial burials, called retainer sacrifices, a somewhat improbable theory as centuries had passed between the last known sacrificial burials and the appearance of the ushabtis. They were generally distinguished from other statuettes by being inscribed with the name of the deceased, his titles, and often with spell 472 of the Coffin TextsBob Brier, op.cit., p.186 or the speech of the ushabti figure found in Chapter Six of the Book of the Dead. In the 18th Dynasty during the reign of Akhenaten, the figurines were inscribed with an offering addressed to the sun disk Aten, rather than the traditional speech of the ushabti figure. The ushabti was believed to magically animate after the dead had been judged, and work for the dead person as a substitute labourer in the fields of Osiris. From the New Kingdom onwards, it was often referred to as servant. A receipt for 401 ushabtis produced by Padikhonsu From the 21st Dynasty on, ushabtis became common and numerous in graves. In some tombs the floor was covered with a great many ushabti figurines; in others the ushabtis were neatly packed into ushabti boxes. At times, several hundred ushabti were placed in a deceased Ancient Egyptian's tomb, but pharaohs had considerably more of these servants than commoners, and king Taharqa had more than a thousand.R. N. Longenecker, Life in the Face of Death: The Resurrection Message of the New Testament, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing 1998, p.28 Some tombs contained overseer or 'reis' ushabtis holding a whip, which were responsible for groups of ten ushabti each (ten being a common administrative division, for example in the armies). These overseers became rare during the Late Period. The tomb of Tutankhamun had a large number of ushabtis of varying sizes, and most were ornate, with hieroglyph statements.27 distinct ushabtis (all given titles), gold foil, multi-columned hieroglyphs, to simple blue faienced; James, 2000, Servant Figures, p. 111‚Äì127. They were divided into groups: some honored Osiriform gods, gold-foiled; some were more simple of wood, or faience. Ushabti with linen grave clothes. 19th Dynasty, Heracleopolis Magna. ==Shape and material== Ushabtis were mostly mummiform, but during the Dynasty XVIII reign of Thutmose IV, they began to be fashioned as servants with baskets, sacks, and other agricultural tools. Some ushabtis were very ornate in form, and in colour, when made of enamel.\\"Relics of Ancient Egypt\\". 1916. The Lotus Magazine. 7 (5): 213-214. They were also made of clay, wood and stoneBrier, op. cit., p.186 and early ones were sometimes made from wax. Later figurines were often made of less perishable materials: stone, terracotta, metal, glass and, most frequently, glazed earthenware (Egyptian faience). While ushabtis manufactured for the rich were often miniature works of art, the great mass of cheaply made ushabtis became standardised--made from single molds with little detail. == See also == * Stick shabti * Wooden tomb model * Shikigami * Dog≈´ * Haniwa * Totem * Terracotta Army ==References== ==Further reading== *Bob Brier, The Encyclopedia of Mummies, Checkmark Books, 1998 *Harry M.

The main development team is Career Soft, first as Team Career within Masaya Games for the first three games and then as an independent studio for Langrisser IV and V. The series has a fantasy-Germanic setting, but draws on religious concepts like ditheism and sword worship for historical context. After separating from Masaya following the release of Langrisser V, Career Soft would produce an unofficial successor in the form of the Growlanser series, published and owned by Atlus, while Masaya would go on to produce Langrisser Millenium with a different development team (Santa Entertainment). ==Gameplay== Langrisser is divided into Scenarios, each of which reveals a portion of the story through battle interaction. The series set itself apart from other tactical RPGs in its time with larger-scale battles, where the player can control over thirty units at one time and fight against scores of enemies.Kurt Kalata, Langrisser, Hardcore Gaming 101 ===Battle system=== At the outset of battle, military commanders are positioned on the game's map and units are hired. Combat always follows a system of turns. In the first two games, any unit can be moved at any time during the player's turn, but each unit can only be moved once. In the last two games, a clock was introduced and units were moved in turn according to agility. A unit's commander class dictates the radius of its command range. Units battling within this command range receive a bonus to their attack and defense due to proximity to the commander. Commanders can recover life using a specific command depending on the game. In the first game the Treat Command will recover 3 health points. In later versions of the game the Treat Command is replaced by the Heal command which recovers 3 health points (HP) and 2 magic points. A commander‚Äôs troops recover by being positioned directly around the commander. Each will recover 3 HP at the start of a turn. Units work on an affinity system. Fliers are strong to soldiers but weak to bowmen. Soldiers are strong to pikemen but weak to cavalry. Cavalry are strong to soldiers and weak to pikemen. Holy units are strong against demon units. Seafaring units get a tactical advantage when attacking from water. The game engine used in Langrisser III is a considerable departure from the rest of the series, relying on mass battles between a commander's entire platoon against his enemy's. ===Non-linearity=== Since Der Langrisser, the series offered non-linear branching paths and multiple endings. The player's choices and actions in Der Langrisser affected which of four different paths they followed, either aligning themselves with one of three different factions or fighting against all of them. Each of the four paths leads to a different ending and there are over 75 possible scenarios. Langrisser III introduced a relationship system similar to dating sims. Depending on the player's choices and actions, the feelings of the female allies will change towards the player character, who will end up with the female ally he is closest with.Kurt Kalata, Langrisser (Page 2), Hardcore Gaming 101 ==Story== El Sallia, since time immemorial, has been influenced by the power of \\"gods\\". The evil gods were originally their own tribe, and over time one rose to power to dominate all the others. He was the dark god, Chaos, worshiped by the devil tribe. Conversely, Lushiris, a goddess of light, was worshiped by the humans. Each god has its own avatar to exercise its power in the human world and prepare for its coming. Chaos' avatar is B√∂ser (German: \\"evil one\\"), a prince of darkness who is really the trapped soul of a damned human. Lushiris' avatar is Jessica, a magician. Each avatar has been entrusted with a sword that carries the weight of the gods‚Äô powers. B√∂ser is responsible for Alhazard, and Jessica is responsible for Langrisser. By choosing a champion for the swords in each era, they influence the world in an endless series of wars. Langrisser itself is a copy of Alhazard made in ancient times and bound to the soul of Sieghart, the first king to rule Elthlead, later called Baldea, as a Descendant of Light. The series includes ties to Team Career's earlier strategy games. The storyline of Elthlead and its sequel Gaia no Monsh≈ç (both released in 1987) depict Sieghart's battles against B√∂ser for the power of Gaia, which serve as the backstory of the original Langrisser (with B√∂ser appearing as the antagonist for all three games). The titular ancient mech from Gaiflame (which is set in the distant future) makes an appearance in Langrisser IV along with other mechs used by the player in the same game. ==Games== Following a complete list of Langrisser products Note: Indented titles are remakes Elthlead trilogy * Elthlead (1987: NEC PC-8801) * Gaia no Monsh≈ç (1988: PC Engine) * Guyframe (1990: PC-Engine) Main series * Langrisser (1991: Mega Drive) ** Langrisser: Hikari no Matsuei (1993: PC Engine Super CD-ROM¬≤) ** Langrisser I (1998: Microsoft Windows) * Langrisser II (1994: Mega Drive) ** Der Langrisser (1995: Super Famicom) ** Der Langrisser FX (1996: PC-FX) ** Langrisser II (1998: Microsoft Windows) * Langrisser III (1996: Sega Saturn; 1998: Windows; 2005: PlayStation 2) * Langrisser IV (1997: Sega Saturn) * Langrisser V: The End of Legend (1998: Sega Saturn) * Langrisser Mobile (January 22, 2019: Android and iOS; March 11, 2019: Microsoft Windows) Until 2016, the only game in the series to be officially localized to English was the original Langrisser, released under the title Warsong for the Genesis.

The topography of Taum Sauk is that of an elongated ridge with a NNW-SSE orientation rather than a peak.Irontown, Missouri, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1968 (1978 rev.) ==Description== While relatively low in terms of elevation at compared to other peaks, Taum Sauk and the St. Francois range are true mountains, being the result of a volcanic orogeny. Whereas vertical relief in the rest of the Ozarks region is the result of erosion of sedimentary strata, the St. Francois are an ancient Precambrian igneous uplift several times older than the Appalachians. Geologists believe that Taum Sauk and its neighbors may be among the few areas in the US never to have been submerged in ancient seas. The peaks of the St. Francois range existed as islands in the shallow seaway throughout most of the Paleozoic Era as the sandstones, limestones, and shales typical of the Ozarks were deposited. Weathering and erosion of these ancient peaks provided the clastic sediments of the surrounding rock layers. Taum Sauk is said to be named for a Piankeshaw chief named Sauk-Ton-Qua. ‚Äî See also Combinations of vowel letters. Though Taum Sauk Mountain is the highest mountain in Missouri, it is not the most prominent. Taum Sauk rises from an already elevated base. Mudlick Mountain rises from a lower base to an elevation of . Black Mountain, in Madison County, has the highest rise in elevation in Missouri. From its base, along the St. Francis River (540 feet above sea level) to its summit ( above sea level), Black Mountain rises just under in elevation from the valley below. ==State park== Taum Sauk is located in a large parks and wilderness area. In 1991 Missouri created Taum Sauk Mountain State Park, a state park on the mountain: it has a rustic campground, a paved trail to the highpoint marked by a polished granite plaque, and a lookout tower from which a good view can be had; the dense forest on the mountain obscures the view from most other vantage points. Taum Sauk State Park is in a common jurisdiction with nearby Johnson's Shut-ins State Park, and together they comprise the second largest state park in Missouri with a total area of . These parks and the adjacent Bell Mountain Wilderness Area make up part of a large wilderness area that is very popular with hikers and backpackers. The Taum Sauk section of the Ozark Trail is considered by the Ozark Trail Association to be one of the finest trails in Missouri. Mina Sauk Falls, the highest waterfall in Missouri, is on Taum Sauk and can be visited by hiking a rugged trail that makes a loop from the highpoint parking area. These falls normally have water cascading over them only during times of wet weather. At other times they are reduced to a trickle or less. The Taum Sauk pumped storage plant, which failed on December 14, 2005 sending a flash flood 20 feet (6 m) deep down the Black River, is not actually on Taum Sauk Mountain.

Other banks, such as Egg and First-e, had offered digital services previously, but smile was the first to offer a full service where customers would not have to visit any high-street branches to do their banking. In fact, they were the first UK online bank to be accredited with the ISO 27001 information security certification. ==History== The smile brand was launched in October 1999. In July 2000, \\"moneybags.co.uk\\" rated smile highly in terms of accessibility, citing its ‚Äòexcellent interest rates, top functionality, nice appearance and lots of clear, helpful information in plain English‚Äô. Additionally, the \\"Internet Made Easy\\" magazine rated smile as ‚Äòsimply the best of the web‚Äô. 2001 saw smile launch ‚Äòsmile invest‚Äô, a collaboration with Fidelity Fundsupermarket which gave smile customers even more opportunity to expand their financial portfolios, and compare more shares and stocks. In 2002, smile also launched Sharedealing to help experienced and new investors build an online portfolio, with 24-hour access. In 2003 there were record interim pre-tax profits for the tenth consecutive year. The first half of 2003 improved on the previous year, up 10% on 2002. As part of this community outreach, smile sponsored the Cape2cape challenge in 2004, where a team flew from the tip of Chile to the coast of Canada in a single plane. This was followed by smile sponsoring the North West Comedy Awards in 2005. In 2008, smile launched an ethical policy vote, giving customers the opportunity to change the things that matter most to them. This included turning down business, including accounts for known arms dealers, cosmetic businesses which test on animals, and companies which affect the environment with dangerous chemicals. 2009 was smile's 10th anniversary, a year in which Moneywise gave smile a ‚ÄòHighly Commended‚Äô rating for its online and call centre service. ==Advertising== In 2000, smile launched a national rollout and a UK-wide ad campaign, featuring the song ‚ÄòSmile‚Äô by The Supernaturals.

It carried three crew members of Expedition 11 to the International Space Station. It was the 26th crewed flight to the ISS. It was launched by a Soyuz FG and returned to earth after performing operations at the ISS. ==Crew== ==Docking with ISS== *Docked to ISS: April 17, 2005, 02:20 UTC (to Pirs module) *Undocked from ISS: July 19, 2005, 10:38 UTC (from Pirs module) *Docked to ISS: July 19, 2005, 11:08 UTC (to nadir port of Zarya) *Undocked from ISS: October 10, 2005, 21:49 UTC (from nadir port of Zarya) ==Mission highlights== Soyuz TMA-6 is a Soyuz TMA spacecraft which was launched on April 15, 2005 by a Soyuz-FG rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome. During the return flight from the ISS, instruments in the descent module of the Soyuz spacecraft indicated a cabin-pressure-leak that is still under investigation. The Expedition 11 crew, Sergei Krikalev-Cdr Russia, John Phillips-U.S.A. replaced the Expedition 10 crew, Leroy Chiao-Cdr U.S.A. and Salizhan Sharipov-Russia. The astronaut Roberto Vittori brought a painting by the German-Russian artist George Pusenkoff titled Single Mona Lisa (1:1) to the space station, which shows an modified image of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, and took video and photo shots of the work in the International Space Station. This art action, initiated by Pusenkoff, was mainly made possible by the efforts of the then Italian ambassador to Russia, Gianfranco Facco Bonetti. The combination of science and art, as da Vinci himself lived it, was used here to let his spirit work not only on earth, but also in space. The photos are documented in the book Mona Lisa Travels. ==References== Category:Crewed Soyuz missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2005 Category:Orbital space tourism missions Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2005 Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-FG rockets ","title":"Soyuz TMA-6"},{"id":"1433987","text":"A thunderclap headache is a headache that is severe and has a sudden onset. It is defined as a severe headache that takes seconds to minutes to reach maximum intensity. Although approximately 75% are attributed to \\"primary\\" headaches‚Äîheadache disorder, non-specific headache, idiopathic thunderclap headache, or uncertain headache disorder‚Äîthe remainder are secondary to other causes, which can include some extremely dangerous acute conditions, as well as infections and other conditions. Usually, further investigations are performed to identity the underlying cause. ==Signs and symptoms== A headache is called \\"thunderclap headache\\" if it is severe in character and reaches maximum severity within seconds to minutes of onset. In many cases, there are no other abnormalities, but the various causes of thunderclap headaches may lead to a number of neurological symptoms. ==Causes== Approximately 75% are attributed to \\"primary\\" headaches: headache disorder, non-specific headache, idiopathic thunderclap headache or uncertain headache disorder. The remainder are secondary to a number of conditions, including: * Subarachnoid hemorrhage (10‚Äì25% of all cases of thunderclap headache) * Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis * Cervical artery dissection * Hypertensive emergency (severely raised blood pressure) * Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (unexplained low cerebrospinal fluid pressure) * Stroke (headache occurs in about 25% of strokes but usually not thunderclap character) * Retroclival hematoma (hematoma behind the clivus in the skull, usually due to physical trauma but sometimes spontaneous) * Pituitary apoplexy (infarction or hemorrhage of the pituitary gland) * Colloid cyst of the third ventricle * Meningitis, sinusitis * Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (previously Call-Fleming syndrome, several subtypes) * Primary cough headache, primary exertional headache, and primary sexual headache The most important of the secondary causes are subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and dissection of an artery in the neck. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, there may be syncope (transient loss of consciousness), seizures, meningism (neck pain and stiffness), visual symptoms, and vomiting. 50‚Äì70% of people with subarachnoid hemorrhage have an isolated headache without decreased level of consciousness. The headache typically persists for several days. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, thrombosis of the veins of the brain, usually causes a headache that reflects raised intracranial pressure and is therefore made worse by anything that makes the pressure rise further, such as coughing. In 2‚Äì10% of cases, the headache is of thunderclap character. In most cases there are other neurological abnormalities, such as seizures and weakness of part of the body, but in 15‚Äì30% the headache is the only abnormality. Carotid artery dissection and vertebral artery dissection (together cervical artery dissection), in which a tear forms inside the wall of the blood vessels that supply the brain, often causes pain on the affected side of the head or neck. The pain usually precedes other problems that are caused by impaired blood flow through the artery into the brain; these may include visual symptoms, weakness of part of the body, and other abnormalities depending on the vessel affected. ==Diagnosis== The most important initial investigation is computed tomography of the brain, which is very sensitive for subarachnoid hemorrhage. If this is normal, a lumbar puncture is performed, as a small proportion of SAH is missed on CT and can still be detected as xanthochromia. If both investigations are normal, the specific description of the headache and the presence of other abnormalities may prompt further tests, usually involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be useful in identifying problems with the arteries (such as dissection), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) identifies venous thrombosis. It is not usually necessary to proceed to cerebral angiography, a more precise but invasive investigation of the brain's blood vessels, if MRA and MRV are normal. ==Epidemiology== Incidence of thunderclap headache has been estimated at 43 per 100,000 people every year. Approximately 75% are attributed to \\"primary\\" headaches: headache disorder, non-specific headache, idiopathic thunderclap headache or uncertain headache disorder. The remainder is attributed to secondary causes: vascular problems, infections and various other conditions. ==History== The importance of severe headaches in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage has been known since the 1920s, when London neurologist Charles Symonds described the clinical syndrome. The term \\"thunderclap headache\\" was introduced in 1986 in a report by John Day and Neil Raskin, neurologists at the University of California, San Francisco, in a report of a 42-year-old woman who had experienced several sudden headaches and was found to have an aneurysm that had not ruptured. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * == External links == Category:Headaches ","title":"Thunderclap headache"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:12,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=12}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(l,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâyour wikiü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),o(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(H,[["render",R]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/1.md","filePath":"guide/1.md"}'),F={name:"guide/1.md"},E=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{N as __pageData,E as default};
