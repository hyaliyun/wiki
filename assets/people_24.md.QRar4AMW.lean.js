Slow to mature, she went on to earn 1997 U.S. Champion Older Mare honors. ==Career== As a two year old, Hidden Lake won only once, in her second start on August 5, 1995, at Del Mar racetrack. She showed some promise by finishing second in the Maker's Mark Stakes and Anoakia Stakes. She started her three- year-old season with an allowance race win on January 6, 1996, at Santa Anita but then went on a six race losing streak that included third place finishes in the Santa Anita Oaks and Las Virgenes Stakes, both Grade I stakes. She finally earned her first graded stakes win in the grade II La Brea Stakes on December 29. At age four, she lost her first four starts of the year while traveling from Santa Anita Park to Oaklawn Park to Churchill Downs. On May 24, she was shipped to Belmont Park for the Grade II Shuvee Handicap, which she won as an 8.8–1 long-shot by 4 lengths. She followed this up with a win in the Grade I Hempstead Handicap (now known as the Ogden Phipps), then shipped to Saratoga for the Go For Wand Handicap on July 27. Hidden Lake went to the early lead but was challenged by Flat Fleet Feet, who moved alongside when they entered the stretch. Flat Fleet Feet looked to have the advantage but Hidden Lake fought back and prevailed by a head. Her jockey, Richard Migliore, called the Go For Wand \\"one of his most memorable victories\\", saying, \\"From the recesses of her heart, Hidden Lake found a way to fight back and win. After the finish line, she actually collapsed from exhaustion. That was how much effort she put into winning that race. She was running on empty and found more to give\\". It was nearly three months before Hidden Lake was ready to race again, but she returned with a victory in the Beldame Stakes at Belmont Park on October 17. Shipped back to California for the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Hollywood Park, she finished seventh in the last start of her career. She received the Eclipse Award as the American Champion Older Dirt Female Horse of 1997. ==Retirement== None of Hidden Lake's seven foals reached her level of success in racing but all made it to the racetrack and four were winners of minor races. With declining fertility, in January of 2009 she was pensioned by owner Robert Evans to Old Friends Equine in Georgetown, Kentucky. On September 29, 2016, she was euthanized due to the infirmities of old age. ==References== Category:1993 racehorse births Category:2016 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Old Friends Equine Retirement Category:Eclipse Award winners ","title":"Hidden Lake (horse)"},{"id":"46760811","text":"The General Electric steam turbine locomotives were two steam turbine locomotives built by General Electric (GE) for Union Pacific (UP) in 1938. The two units were streamlined, in length, capable of producing , and reputedly able to attain speeds of . Stylistically, they resembled UP's Pullman-designed M-10003 through M-10006 power units and contemporary Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC) diesel designs. The two locomotives were delivered to UP in April 1939, and they completed test runs and participated in a variety of publicity events for the railroad, including the grand opening of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, the world premiere of Cecil B. DeMille's film Union Pacific, and an inspection by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the locomotives displayed excellent acceleration and could maintain schedules better than conventional steam locomotives, they were also unreliable and expensive to maintain. They never entered regular revenue service. In June 1939, UP returned the locomotives to GE. By December 1941, the railroad had abandoned the project. In 1941, the GE steam turbine locomotives were tested by the New York Central, and they were operated by the Great Northern in 1943 during the World War II \\"power crunch\\" (a lack of sufficient locomotives to sustain regular operations) before being retired from service later that year. They were scrapped before the end of World War II. == Background == Development of the General Electric (GE) steam turbine locomotives began in late 1936, when GE and the Union Pacific (UP) began collaborating on an oil-powered steam turbine-electric design that they termed a \\"steam-electric locomotive\\". To produce an altogether new type of locomotive, GE hoped to adapt mature steam turbine technology from maritime and stationary applications for railroad use. Early GE specifications detailed a streamlined shape, 2+C-C+2 wheel arrangement, and production of and of starting tractive effort (the force generated by a locomotive's prime mover in order to generate motion through tractive force). GE had hoped to deliver a prototype steam turbine locomotive to UP in 1937, but none were completed until December 1938, and were delivered for testing in spring 1939. In total, the two prototype locomotives had taken almost two years to complete. == Design == A GE steam turbine locomotive on a test run in 1938 GE's new steam turbine locomotives featured streamlined bodies with an appearance somewhat similar to contemporary EMC diesel streamliner designs. The GE locomotives had lightweight bodies consisting of steel frames covered with riveted sheet metal, most of which was made of aluminum. They also had elevated cabs, similar to those of UP's Pullman-designed M-10003 through M-10006, which afforded greater visibility. The noses were significantly longer than those on the Pullman units, at , which afforded safety for operating crews. In total, each unit measured in length, in width (at the cab), and in height. The February 1939 issue of General Electric Review claimed that each of the steam turbine locomotives could attain speeds of and that they had two times a conventional steam locomotive's thermal efficiency. The two units built for UP were streamlined and capable of producing , and had been designed to operate together \\"elephant style\\", nose to tail. Fully loaded, each of the two locomotives weighed . Each could produce of starting tractive effort, and between and of continuous tractive effort, depending on the amount of cooling. Both of the locomotives had Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers, as well as specialized Bailey Meter Company equipment designed to automatically fire and regulate the boiler. Each boiler regularly operated at and to , a boiler pressure higher than that of any extant steam locomotive and much higher than contemporary conventional steam locomotives. The GE locomotives stored enough oil to give them an operating range of to . The turbines were designed to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator powered auxiliary functions such as traction motor blowers and providing head-end power. The latter, which provided lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s. Another notable feature was dynamic brakes, where some (or most) braking is created by running the traction motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating that electric power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the roof-top open-air coolers on most modern locomotives. The resistors were cooled by water from the steam loop, thus heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recaptured into motive power, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking. The locomotives also used a gear ratio of 65:31, as well as driving wheels with a diameter of and -diameter guide and trailing wheels. Each also had a 2+C-C+2 wheel arrangement, or 4-6-0-0-6-4T in Whyte notation. Although sold to UP together and promoted as a single locomotive, the two units were capable of operation independently of each other. == Operation == A circa-1939 postcard touting the GE steam turbine locomotives' \\"firsts\\", including first multiple operation of two steam locomotives by a single engineer The locomotives were in operation for six months, among the shortest operational careers in recorded railroading. After being completed in December 1938, they were first tested by GE at its Erie, Pennsylvania facility, then road tested on New York Central tracks between January and March 1939. They were then delivered to UP in April 1939 at Omaha, Nebraska, in time for the 70th anniversary of the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in May, and given road numbers 1 and 2. According to UP historians William Kratville and Harold Ranks, the new locomotives were hoped to be the \\"replacement to steam\\" and the \\"successor of diesels\\". After completing test runs, UP put the locomotives on public display with tour trains, a national tour, and an inspection by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were present at the grand opening of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal and were on display in Omaha for the world premier of Cecil B. DeMille's film Union Pacific on April 28. During test runs, the locomotives displayed excellent acceleration and an ability to maintain schedules better than conventional steam engines, although they also had serious reliability problems and relatively high maintenance costs. On one occasion, the two locomotives failed while hauling a train from Colorado to Omaha, necessitating a 2800-class Pacific steam locomotive to pull them along with the rest of the train for the remainder of the journey. The locomotives worked on several routes in a variety of different capacities, including both passenger and perishable freight service, although they never entered regular revenue service; in June 1939, the railroad returned them to GE in Chicago for what UP president W. M. Jeffers called \\"necessary modification and/or reconstruction\\". While UP retained interest in the concept of steam turbine locomotives for the next two years, in December 1941 it decided to end its agreement with GE. Rail transport author Brian Solomon opines that this was due to the development of other types of locomotives, particularly the 4-8-8-4 \\"Big Boy\\" steam locomotives, EMD E-units, and EMD FT freight diesels, as well as a potential personnel change in the railroad's motive power department in 1939., back cover GE continued to work on its steam turbine locomotives after UP lost interest. In 1941, the New York Central tested them along its Water Level Route in New York. During the \\"power crunch\\" on American railroads caused by World War II, in 1943 the steam turbine locomotives were operated by the Great Northern between Spokane and Wenatchee, Washington. By that point, they had been repainted a dark gray and renumbered GE-1 and GE-2. According to a number of sources, including The Streamliner, they provided satisfactory service for GN. By late 1943, the locomotives were retired from service and returned to GE. They were scrapped before the end of World War II. == Legacy == The GE steam turbine locomotives were both the first turbine locomotives to be built in North America as well as GE's only steam-powered locomotives. In the words of history professor and author Jeffrey W. Schramm, the locomotives \\"were the most ambitious and technologically advanced locomotives to have traveled American rails to that point.\\", back cover UP historian Alfred Bruce described the design as \\"one of the most exceptional steam locomotives ever built\\".

He subsequently became a founder member of Ordre Nouveau (ON), assuming a leading role within the group. He belonged to the more moderate tendency within the ON which sought to distance far right nationalism from the earlier strains of fascism, in contrast to the likes of François Duprat who sought to emphasise fascist continuity.Roger Eatwell, fascism: A History, Random House, 2011, p. 315 Within the ON Brigneau advocated a united front between different strands of the French far right.André Gingrich, Marcus Banks, Neo-nationalism in Europe and Beyond: Perspectives from Social Anthropology, Berghahn Books, 2006, pp. 178-179 To this end he became a founder member of the Front National (FN) in 1972 and was an unsuccessful candidate for the party in the 1973 legislative election in Hauts-de-Seine. He was the first secretary-general of the movement and also served as vice-president. Brigneau however soon clashed with Jean-Marie Le Pen, who he felt was too personally ambitious, and in June 1973 he split from the FN to become part of the dissident Faire Front group. In November 1974 this group, which had not been formalised but rather was a loose collection of leading ex-FN dissidents, was reconstituted as a political under the name Parti des forces nouvelles (PFN), with Brigneau taking a leading role in this group. He spent several years within the PFN as a member of its political bureau before resigning in 1981 after reassessing his position on Le Pen, whom he came to view as a \\"Breton genius\\" and an \\"inspired prophet\\". Around this time he also broke off his association with Minute, moving to Le Présent, a Catholic integrist journal to which he contributed anti-Semitic articles under the pseudonym Mathilde Cruz. He was removed from this position in late 1986 after the journal moderated its approach by de-emphasising attacks on the Jews.Ciarán Ó Maoláin, The Radical Right: A World Directory, Longman, 1987, p. 104 ==Later activity== Brigneau would subsequently write for National-Hebdo, his regular column \\"Le Journal d'un Homme Libre\\" largely focusing on the same anti-Semitic themes that had dominated his work for Le Présent, with a particular focus on conspiracy theories and the activities of B'nai B'rith.Harvey Gerald Simmons, The French National Front: The Extremist Challenge To Democracy, Westview Press, 1996, p. 125 Although no longer a member of the FN his column also offered the party unwavering support. He would later become associated with Bruno Mégret and in 1998 lent his support to the National Republican Movement, a splinter group of the FN that Mégret established following a bitter split from Le Pen. Brigneau died in 2012 aged 92. He was buried in Saint-Cloud with no representative of the FN in attendance at his funeral. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:2012 deaths Category:French journalists Category:National Rally (France) politicians Category:Party of New Forces politicians Category:People from Concarneau Category:French crime fiction writers Category:20th-century French novelists Category:20th-century French male writers Category:Breton writers Category:French male non-fiction writers ","title":"François Brigneau"},{"id":"46760849","text":"Corfu is an unincorporated community in Grant County, in the U.S. state of Washington. ==History== A post office called Corfu was established in 1910, and remained in operation until 1943.

During his stay in the city he by mistake is framed as a serial killer and sentenced to hanging. Nirahu announces his last wish: being married simultaneously. A rich girl, Sona (Amrapali Dubey), is under constant pressure from her handicapped and ill father to marry before his death. Her father leaves a will precising that Sona must marry to inherit his estate, so Sona decides to marry Nirahu when she sees his last wish broadcast on TV. Assuming the death sentence to Nirahu getting serviced in nine days, Sona takes a risk and proposes to marry him. Having found his dream girl proposing him for the marriage, Nirahu, too, agrees. In the meantime, actual serial killer resurfaces, kills again, and is finally arrested. Nirahu is released from jail and reaches Sona's place where he learns Sona's motivation for marrying him. So Nirahu plans to leave for his village, but Sona's uncle convinces him to deal with the challenge instead of running away from it. Nirahu agrees and makes Sona's life miserable with his Villager tactics. During this span, Sona and Nirahu come to know about the condition in the will of Sona's father, according to which Sona can't divorce Nirahu otherwise she will lose her right to the estate of her father and there is only one way by which she can get her right if Nirahu divorces her. Unable to convince Nirahu to divorce, she arranges a party with her friends where she makes fun of Nirahu and his villager behavior in front of everyone, to which Nirahu reacts sharply and an argument erupts between them. Nirahu agrees to divorce Sona on a condition if she comes with him to his village and stays with his family for six months. After much deliberation and discussion with her friends, Sona accepts the offer. She takes her friends to Nirahu's village for moral support. On reaching the village, Sona becomes point of attraction for all the people due to her western style of dress only to bring shame to Nirahu's family. Other than Nirahu's father, everyone welcomes the new bride without knowing the truth. Sona and her friends spend their first few days at Nirahu's village. The friends become disgusted and leave for Mumbai, leaving Sona alone to tackle her issues. Frustrated Sona mistreats Nirahu's family, angering his father every day. One day he is angered when the villagers complain about Sona's manner of dress, which according to village culture is inappropriate. Furious with these remarks he reaches home only to see his daughter and elder daughter-in-law dressed in Sona's clothes. Angered, he burns all the clothing, igniting an argument with Nirahu who in turn supports Sona. After all this incident, Sona asks her mother-in-law to help her get dressed in a saree, to which she readily agrees. Slowly, Sona warms to Nirahu because of his good behavior, and assimilates Bhojpuiri culture over next few weeks. The villagers and her father-in-law appreciate her coaching Nirahu's nephew for an English test which he has so far consistently failed. Sona and Nirahu develop feelings for each other but never express it. Having become an integral part of Nirahu's family, Sona one day is surprised by the visit of her old boyfriend Tony, who discloses the reason for her marriage to her in- laws. Tony tries to force her to return to Mumbai, but she refuses. With the help of his goons, Tony tries to take her, Nirahu foils this. Later, in front of his family Nirahu accepts the divorce terms which he agreed with Sona while bringing her to his village six months ago. Since the tenure is completed he needs to divorce her and send her back to Mumbai. Nirahu, unaware of Sona's feelings for him takes her to the bus station. When he reaches his home drunk and depressed, he finds Sona in his room. Nirahu is surprised and believes it to be a dream.

In the twenty-first century, some people have created and recorded their journeys around the island as 'events' for publicity and fund raising, with most walks mentioned here in the latter category. A north–south crossing of Australia may also include walking around Tasmania, known as a 'traversal crossing'. Historically, the sheer volume of people walking or traversing the island in a number of ways is not traceable. Some noted nineteenth-century ventures around the island before proper roads included such ventures of the walks of Thomas Bather Moore and the Walk to the West, which involved substantial logistic issues due to terrain and lack of support. ==Twenty-first-century ventures== The claims of these ventures in no way should be considered 'firsts', as in most cases earlier walks of substantially more difficult circumstances were never recorded in this manner. Also most walks and walkers are on made roads. {  - ! Name !! Age !!Nationality !! Start date !! Finish date !! Duration !! Distance !! Starting location !! Finishing location !!

They backpacked the entire coastal route, although they did accept some offers of food and hospitality along the way. Kelvyn was 14 years old at the time, making him the youngest person to have walked across Tasmania, at that time. This was also the first father-son team to complete the journey. His father went on to complete a walk around the perimeter of Tasmania, becoming the first person to do so. ===Hardy James \\"Jimmy\\" Harrington=== Hardy James \\"Jimmy\\" Harrington walked around Tasmania, in 2014 to raise funds for child cancer. He left Melbourne on the Spirit of Tasmania to Devonport on 2 May, departing Devonport toward Hobart on 3 May. His route took him through Deloraine to Launceston, through the Epping Forest to Ross, to Oatlands, past Bagdad and into Hobart on 9 May. He then rested in Hobart a day then went back to Devonport and departed once again on the Spirit of Tasmania back to Melbourne (11 May). James was 20 years old at the time. ===Scott Loxley=== Scott Loxley walked across Tasmania, in 2013 to raise funds for he Monash Children's Hospital.

His first crossing included crossing Tasmania. His first journey commenced in 2004. John walked 5,622 km unsupported from Cape York to Tasmania in 167 days, and raised a little over $10,000 for a charity working with children with cerebral palsy. On 18 June 2008, John Olsen undertook his second walk, walking from Steep Point, to Cape Byron. He travelled a distance 4752 km, raising $130,000 for the Australian Lions Children's Mobility Foundation (ALCMF) and the Australian Leukodystrophy Support Group Inc (ALDS). The disparity in distance is due to John walking back to his home in Geelong after reaching Cape Byron. Both the ALCMF and ALDS help children with progressive degenerative brain disease, which gives rise to mobility problems. The progress of John's second journey was broadcast by Ian McNamara's ABC radio's ‘Australia All Over’ program on Sundays. John completed the walk in 200 days, finishing on 3 January 2009. John's accomplishment was recognised by Sensis when they depicted him on the cover of the local (Geelong and Colac) Yellow and White Pages directories for 2010/2011 ===Andrew \\"Cad\\" Cadigan=== Andrew \\"Cad\\" Cadigan finished a solo walk from Sydney back to Sydney in June 2012. He walked unassisted via Tasmania, Melbourne, Adelaide, Albany, Perth, Broome, Darwin, Townsville, and Brisbane. Cadigan undertook the walk in honour of Chris Simpson, a friend who had died from complications related to myelodysplasia, and raised over $65,000 - $25,000 for The Cancer Council and $40,000 for the Leukemia Foundation. Shortly after completing the walk, whilst holidaying and recuperating in Thailand, Cadigan suffered head injuries in a motorcycle accident, and later died in hospital in Sydney, on 5 October 2012. A book, written by his author father Neil, about his walk and tragic death was released in 2014.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15. Kalinga, 16. Park Street, 17. Victoria Terrace, 18. Hastings, 19. Entali, 20. Beniapukur, 21. Baliganj-Tollyganj, 22. Bhabanipur, 23. Alipur, 24.Ekbalpur and 25. Watganj. A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213-215, Oxford University Press, . The state government superseded the Corporation in 1948 and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. Adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 86 is bordered on the north by Hazra Road; on the east by Leela Roy Sarani and Gariahat Road; on the south by Dr. Meghnad Saha Sarani (Southern Avenue); and on the west by Garcha 1st Lane, Dover Terrace connecting Garcha 1st Lane, Dover Lane, Ramani Chatterjee Road and Lake West Road. The ward is served by Lake and Gariahat police stations of Kolkata Police.Kolkata: Detail Maps of 141 Wards with Street Directory, Fourth Impression 2003, Map No. 58, D.P.

The ship was surmised to be a Southeast Asian cargo boat travelling from either Vietnam or Southern China and is one of the best preserved pre-Spanish trading ships within the jurisdiction of Philippines. It is speculated that the ship stopped at some ports in mainland South East Asia to load trade wares. Bad weather might have led to the sinking of the ship.Cayron, J. (2006) \\"Stringing the Past: An Archaeological Understanding of Early Southeast Asian Glass Bead Trade\\" The University of the Philippines Press. The boat’s dimensions are about 25 to 30 meters long and about six to eight meters wide. It had a flat bottom which was suited for riverine water.Orillaneda, B. (2000) \\"The San Diego and Pandanan Wrecks: Two Underwater Archaeological Sites\\" Hukay Volume 2 Number 2. The Pandanan shipwreck is considered a rare site dated approximately at the mid-15th century because, as per Sakuma (1989), the Chinese imperial court ordered complete banning of all private trading within this time.Sakuma, S. (1989) \\"Prohibition of Overseas Trade and its Influence of International Relations in the Early Reign of the Ming Dynasty\\" Journal of East-West Maritime Relations, vol. 1, pp. 31–46. ==Discovery== The discovery of the shipwreck was accidental. A long-time diver from the Ecofarm Systems Inc. (a pearl farm in Pandanan Island) named Eduardo Gordirilla stumbled upon the site by chance and found jars in the seabed as he was looking for a lost basket containing giant oysters. He then informed the manager of the farm, Efren T. Anies, who consequently called upon the national museum on June 9, 1993. Although a report about the wreck was submitted as early as 1993, it was only in 1995 that the official extensive excavated began. Surveying was done within the span of one year (1993 to 1994). The ship was spotted under a coral reef cliff covered in sand and mud and is relatively near the land mass-only 250 meters away from the northeast coast. Typical holes were discovered along the divisions of the bulkhead of the ship so as to aid in letting water pass as it is pumped out. In addition, only one fourth of the body of the ship remained intact. Two theories were proposed for the ship’s condition. One is the infestation of the exposed wood by tropical sea worms. Second is the destructive capability of the rapid water currents. The area is well-dated due to the presence of Chinese coins and ceramics. This site is considered a major step in discovering the culture of the country as there is little written records and archives about the Philippines and South East Asia in general during the 15th century. ==Location and geography of the site== Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) the coordinates were identified to be eight degrees, nine minutes and forty-eight seconds (8° 9′ 48″) north latitude and one hundred seventeen degrees three minutes and six seconds (117° 3′ 6″) east longitude and had a depth of approximately 40 meters below sea level. The Pandanan Island is 9.6 km long and 4 km wide and shaped like a quadrangle. Grid maps were also made so as to accurately note the part of the site where a certain artifact was discovered. ==Site excavation== Three rafts were employed in the Pandanan excavation. The first raft was used to travel the generator for the SCUBA tank compressor and for supplying power to the submersible power pump. As for the second raft, it was used to carry and store diving gears and wet suits. The last raft served the role of lifting and delivering the artifacts that were obtained from the underwater site. Dredging systems were used to clear away the mud, sand and coral that covered the ship. Once artifacts have been lifted from the site, they were immediately put in a saltwater bath. This allowed the limestone and coral to keep its layers from being damaged. Archaeologists and Conservators then cautiously cleansed, tagged and put the recovered ceramics in a protective storage before it was sent to the National Museum.Lord, B. and Lord, G. (1992) \\"The Manual of Museum Exhibitions\\". Altamira Press: A Division of Rowman and LittleField Publishers Inc. All operations were undertaken only done during the day in order to maintain the safety of the divers and staff as well as to the inefficiency of work and low visibility during the night. Divers excavated for thirty minutes before ascending. They spend an hour for decompression stops to eliminate dissolved inert gases such as nitrogen in the blood- starting from 15 meters then ascending at three meters increments and switching from air to oxygen at the last two stops. ==Artifacts retrieved== A total of 4,722 artifacts have been recovered from the ship, a major percentage of which are Vietnamese ceramics (at 72.4 percent). These finds are categorized into six main groups depending on their kinds namely: Porcelain and ceramics, metals, coins, glass artifacts (beads), stone tools and earthenwares. These are discussed individually below.Dizon, E. and Tanaka, K. \\"Shipwreck Site and Earthenware Vessels in the Philippines: Earthenware vessels of the Pandanan Shipwreck Site\\" ===Chinese porcelain and stonewares=== The Chinese porcelain category are made up of blue-and-white materials as well as the white wares, both of which have been manufactured in Jingdezhen kiln. The blue-and-white wares consist of several items such as saucers, bowls, large bowls and small jarlets. Another blue-and-white item was a Ming dynasty bowl with qilin. On the other hand, white wares accounts for the two pieces of gourd-shaped pouring vessels- Yuan dynasty spotted Qingbai double gourd pouring vessel. The spots from the gourd were applied by putting droplets of ferrous oxide on the white glaze.Schreurs, g. (2011) \\"The Rasikajy civilization in northeast Madagascar: a pre-European Chinese community?\\" (http://oceanindien.revues.org/1221) The Celadon wares produced in Longquan kiln have also been located and these were composed on dishes with floral flaring rim, bowls having lotus patterns, saucers and stemmed cups. The Chinese stonewares that were made in kilns in Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China were in the form of six eared jars donned with a dragon design. ===Porcelain from Northern Vietnam and Central Vietnam=== The porcelain from Northern Vietnam was also blue-and-white ware which were manufactured in Chu Dau kiln. These were consisted of bowls, dishes, pots, jarlets, covered boxes and lastly water droppers. Meanwhile, the porcelain and stonewares from Central Vietnam were speculated to be produced on the Go Sanh kiln in Binh Dinh Province in Central Vietnam. These consisted mainly of celadon saucers and dishes with an unglazed ring portion inside it. ===Porcelain and stonewares from Thailand=== The porcelain from Thailand were consisted of a large bowl with a fish design drawn in iron pigment inside made in the Sukhothai kiln. As for the stonewares, it was a black brown glazed four-eared jar and was manufactured in Noi River kiln. ===Metallic artifacts=== Under this category were bronze artifacts and iron tools. The bronze items were made up of two small canons, a lamp, a scale balance, a mirror, a covered box, a disc, a fish hook, a fernule and lastly five gongs. The latter consists of a sword, a knife and approximately 60 pieces of cauldrons. ===Chinese coins=== The Chinese coins were dated to be from 1403 to 1424 AD. One of them was determined to be a coin issued during the reign of the Yongle Emperor. ===Stone tools=== There were 21 grinding stones excavated from the shipwreck. These were postulated to be used for honing and sharpening metal blades such as swords and knives or for processing of food. ===Earthenwares=== A total of 301 earthenware vessels and fragments were recovered from the wreck. These were further classified into five categories according to type namely: pot, lid, jarlet, pouring vessel and stove. Pots Four restorable pots were found of which one has a design and the remaining three pots without design. The decorated pot has a carination at the middle of the body and an out-turned rim of about 15.6 centimeters diameter, 10.8 centimeters height and 17.2 centimeters maximum body width. A pronged tool was said to be used to carve decorations from the neck to the anterior portion of the body. In addition, two parallel vertical lines are added extending from the neck to the upper part of the body at 7 to 8 millimeter intervals. As for the lower ends of the parallel lines, they were bordered off with incised horizontal wavy lines. It is heavily substantiated that this pot was used for cooking in the ship due to the soot covering the upper body of the said pot. Meanwhile, one of the plain pots was found to have polishing markings on the bottom executed in just one direction. It also had an out- turned rim. This pot had 13.7 centimeters of rim diameter, 8.2 centimeters of height and 13.2 centimeters of bottom width. As from the specified dimensions, it can be observed that it is a relatively small pot. This whole pot was covered completely in soot with the exception of te bottom part. The second plain pot which had a designated accession no. 3684 is larger compared to the previous pot. This, too had an out-turned rim. It had a rounded bottom as well. The dimensions are as follows: 17.1 centimeter rim diameter, 10.8 centimeter height, and 17.7 centimeter maximum body width. Soot covered the pot from the outer surface until the curved part. The third plain pot donning the accession no. 3044 had an out-turned rim and rounded bottom just as that from the second pot. It had a rim diameter of 14.8 centimeters, a maximum body width of 19 centimeters and a height of 14.5 centimeters. Soot covered it from the outside of the rim to the angled portion of the body. Lids Under this category, there were three whole artifacts of the similar shape was located. They were all characterized as having a concave top portion and a convex bottom portion. They also had a small knob at the center of the top part and two of them had knobs with a flattened top and the other with a knob with a rounded top. One was 11.8 cm–11.9 cm in diameter and 2.6 cm–2.7 cm in height.The rest was at 14.3 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height. Reddish brown particles were scattered over the lids too. All the lids are proposed to have been created in Thailand due to the iconic shape of the three. Jarlet There was only one piece of jarlet. It had an out-turned rim, a short neck plus an ellipsoidal body. Rim diameter was measured to be 6.8 cm, maximum body width is 10 cm and height is 6.5 cm. Horizontal markings caused by wiping at the rim and neck were identified as well. Pouring vessels Two vessels were excavated and one of them was preserved well such that it was almost complete. In contrast, the other one had a missing rim and neck—hence only the body and bottom remained intact. The almost complete pouring vessel had a spherical body. The outer surface had a dimple at the center and a horizontal applique ridge at the upper part of the body. The bottom was polished. The incomplete vessel had an ellipse body shape and the upper part is quite flat in comparison. The center portion is higher than the outside portion and a 3.1 cm diameter hole. Maximum body width is 16 cm, the height of remaining body is 9.7 and width of spout is 7.3 cm measured at its junction to the body. Stove There are two sections of the stove. The first is used to cradle the pod and the second is the lighted firewood underneath. The long end of the wood stretches until the other section where the cook can maneuver the firewood to keep the strength of fire under control. There are three types of stove identified. The first type has a fan-shaped for the part used in putting firewood, and a half-cut cylindrical shape for the part used in burning the wood. The second type is quadrangular for the part used in putting firewood. It also has low walls around the edges. Lastly the third stove type has a similar quadrangular shape for the part used in putting firewood, and a cylindrical shape with quadrangular cut in front for the part used in burning. It looks like a ring from the top and three small cleats are attached around the ring. ===Glass beads=== The glass beads were found inside the Vietnamese stoneware jars. Only two colors of the beads were present- black and red. Several aspects of the beads were specified by Jun Cayron (2006) to be able to determine the origin of the beads. The first proposed method was through chemical analysis which is a technique based on the composition of the material and after which the result was then to be compared with data from several manufacturing sites. However, aside from the high cost and unavailability of the procedure, the technique is believed to be unreliable in this situation and will contribute very little to the bead-sourcing according to Dr. Peter Grave and other experts. This is mostly because the glass’ deterioration is unstable due to the submersion for hundreds of years. Thus, physical analyses had been the main method used. The stylistic attribute (color and decoration), form attribute (shape and size) and technological attribute (method of manufacture) of 204 glass Pandanan beads were consequently studied and compared with the 20 glass beads from Sungai Mas. The study revealed that the beads from the two sources were very similar in their overall diameter and perforation diameter- 17 pieces (85%) from Sungai Mas had identical match with those from Pandanan site. Therefore, it was concluded that Sungai Mas was the source of the Pandanan glass beads. ==Implications on theory of trade== The location of Sungai Mas at the northwest coast of Malaysia suggested that in order to reach South China Sea and Philippines the beads were travelled towards the east coast across the Malaysian peninsula. In turn, the Malaysian peninsula could be reached either en route Malacca strait (if by sea) or Sunda Strait (if by land). The Pandanan ship is said to be a Southeast Asian cargo boat from South China or Vietnam, and most likely travelled southward stopping at either port of Patani or port of Singora where the Sungai Mas beads were loaded together with other trade goods. Then from the port,the vessel traversed towards northern Borneo and then to Labuan. Consequently, it may have entered the Balabac Strait on its way towards southern Palawan where it ultimately sank. ==References== Category:Shipwrecks of the Philippines Category:History of Palawan Category:Archaeological sites in the Philippines Category:Shipwrecks in the South China Sea Category:1993 archaeological discoveries Category:Underwater archaeological sites ","title":"Pandanan Shipwreck"},{"id":"46761319","text":"The 1980 United States presidential election in Rhode Island took place on November 4, 1980, as part of the 1980 United States presidential election. Voters chose four representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. The Democratic Party candidate, incumbent President Jimmy Carter, won the state of Rhode Island over former California Governor Ronald Reagan by 43,549 votes, giving him one of just seven victories in the election (other than Rhode Island, Carter also carried Maryland, Minnesota, Hawaii, West Virginia, the District of Columbia and his home state of Georgia). As a result of Rhode Island voting for Carter, it became the only state in New England to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1980. While Carter was able to win Rhode Island by more than 10%, some of his votes were taken away by the strong third party candidacy of John B. Anderson, a liberal Republican Congressman who ran in 1980 as an independent after failing to win the Republican Party's own presidential nomination. Anderson proved very popular with liberal and moderate voters in New England who viewed Reagan as too far to the right and with normally leaning Democratic voters who were dissatisfied with the policies of the Carter Administration. New England overall would prove to be Anderson's strongest region in the nation, with all six New England states giving double- digit percentages to Anderson. In fact, Rhode Island would ultimately prove to be John Anderson's third strongest state in the nation after neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, his 14.38% of the vote in the state more than double the 6.61% he got nationwide. Nationally, Reagan won the election with 489 electoral votes and 50.75% of the popular vote. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  1980 United States presidential election in Rhode Island -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - ! 3333FF; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  Jimmy Carter (incumbent)  align=\\"right\\"  198,342  align=\\"right\\"  47.67%  align=\\"right\\"  4 - !

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams, 13–3. The game was played on February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. This was the first Super Bowl played at that stadium, and the third one held in Atlanta. The Patriots' victory was their sixth, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl championships. New England, after finishing the regular season with a 11–5 record, advanced to their 11th Super Bowl appearance, their fourth in five years, their ninth, and final under both the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Rams, who finished the regular season with a 13–3 record under 33-year-old head coach Sean McVay and third-year quarterback Jared Goff, advanced to their fourth Super Bowl appearance overall, and their first one since relocating back from St. Louis to Los Angeles in 2016. Super Bowl LIII was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI, a 20–17 Patriots win over the Rams that gave the Belichick–Brady tandem its first Super Bowl championship. Coincidentally, the Patriots reached that Super Bowl with an 11–5 record as well. With the Rams now playing in Los Angeles, Super Bowl LIII marked the first Super Bowl appearance of a Los Angeles-based team since the then-Los Angeles Raiders' victory in Super Bowl XVIII and the Rams' first Super Bowl appearance as a Los Angeles-based team since Super Bowl XIV. This marked the 14th meeting in a major sports championship between the Los Angeles and Greater Boston areas. Super Bowl LIII was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl game in history, eclipsing the previous record of 14–7 held by Super Bowl VII, and the lowest-scoring league championship contest since a 14–0 score was recorded during the 1949 NFL Championship Game. It also marked the first Super Bowl with no touchdowns scored by either team in the first three quarters, as the Patriots and the Rams battled to a 3–3 tie as they entered the fourth quarter. New England then scored 10 unanswered points for the victory, as their lone touchdown tied them with the New York Jets in Super Bowl III for the fewest touchdowns by a winning Super Bowl team. The Rams ended up as only the second Super Bowl team to not score a touchdown, joining the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI. Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who caught 10 passes for 141 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. The broadcast of the game on CBS, along with the halftime show headlined by U.S. pop group Maroon 5, saw the smallest Super Bowl audience in 10 years. ==BackgroundHost-selection process=== On May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host Super Bowl LIII in 2019, LIV in 2020, and LV in 2021. NFL owners voted on these cities on May 24, 2016, with the first round of voting determining the host for Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding a different site for Super Bowl LIV and the third round deciding the site for Super Bowl LV. The four finalists for Super Bowl LIII, all in the Southeastern United States, were: * Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia: This would be the first Super Bowl played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium after it opened in 2017. The city had previously hosted two Super Bowls at the Georgia Dome, with the last being Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. * Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida: South Florida had previously hosted 10 Super Bowls, with the last being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. * Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana: New Orleans had previously hosted 10 Super Bowls, with the last being Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. * Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida: Tampa has hosted four Super Bowls, with the last being Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. After three votes, Atlanta was awarded Super Bowl LIII at the NFL owners' meeting on May 24, 2016. The losing candidates, except for New Orleans which removed itself from the voting for all games except Super Bowl LIII due to event conflicts in 2020 and 2021, were then pitted against SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California for Super Bowl LIV and Super Bowl LV hosting rights. Miami eventually won the rights to host Super Bowl LIV and Los Angeles won the rights to host Super Bowl LV. However, on May 23, 2017, NFL owners opted to award Super Bowl LV to Tampa and give Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles after it was announced that SoFi Stadium would open in 2020 due to construction delays. New Orleans would be awarded Super Bowl LVIII. The NFL unveiled the official logo for Super Bowl LIII in February 2018; it is a navy blue-tinted version of the design introduced at Super Bowl LI, and the overall branding of the game featured use of blue and red. The host committee logo featured a stylized overhead rendition of Mercedes-Benz Stadium's roof. ===Teams=== New England Patriots Julian Edelman The Patriots finished the 2018 season with an 11–5 record to earn the #2 seed in the AFC and their 17th season with at least ten wins in their 19 years under 66-year-old head coach Bill Belichick. They went on to join the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills as the only teams in NFL history to ever reach three consecutive Super Bowls. Though the team had only two Pro Bowl selections, they scored 436 points (fourth in the league) while giving up only 325 (seventh fewest). Patriots quarterback Tom Brady earned his 14th Pro Bowl selection at age 41, finishing the season with 4,355 passing yards and 29 touchdowns, with only 11 interceptions, while also rushing for 35 yards and two more scores on the ground. These totals made him just the second quarterback in NFL history to amass 70,000 career passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards. His top receiver from the previous season, Brandin Cooks, was traded to the eventual Super Bowl rival Rams, but Julian Edelman, who had missed the previous season with an torn ACL injury, returned to catch 74 receptions for a team-leading 850 yards and six touchdowns, while also returning 20 punts for 154 yards. Other key receivers included Chris Hogan (35 receptions for 553 yards and three touchdowns) and Josh Gordon (40 receptions for 720 yards and three touchdowns), though Gordon would end up leaving the team to focus on his mental health after 11 games when faced with a suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Tight end Rob Gronkowski added 47 receptions for 682 yards and three touchdowns. Meanwhile, the running game featured a dynamic new weapon, rookie halfback Sony Michel, who lead the team with 931 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns, along with veteran James White who racked up 1,176 yards from scrimmage while leading the team in receptions (87) and total touchdowns (12). On special teams, receiver Cordarrelle Patterson returned 23 kickoffs for 663 yards and a touchdown, an average of 28.8 yards per return (third in the NFL), while also catching 21 passes for 247 yards, rushing for 228 yards and scoring four touchdowns on offense. On defense, defensive end Trey Flowers led the team with 7.5 sacks and also forced three fumbles. Linebacker Kyle Van Noy led the team in total tackles (92), while also recording 3.5 sacks, a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries. In the secondary, safety Duron Harmon lead the team in interceptions for the second year in a row with four, while Pro Bowl cornerback Stephon Gilmore intercepted two passes and forced two fumbles. Safety Patrick Chung also made an impact with 84 total tackles to go with an interception and a fumble recovery. The Patriots secondary also featured twin brothers Jason McCourty and Devin McCourty, who both had an interception each. Devin had 82 tackles, while Jason had 70. Los Angeles Rams The Rams finished the 2018 season earning the #2 seed in the NFC, before knocking off the fourth seeded Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round and top seeded New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship to earn their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history. The Rams went from 2004 to 2016 without recording a winning record. After relocating from St. Louis back to Los Angeles and posting a dismal 4–12 season in 2016, the team's fortunes changed with the hiring of 30-year-old head coach Sean McVay, the youngest head coach in NFL history. Under McVay and second year quarterback Jared Goff, who recovered from a lackluster winless rookie season to record a triple digit passer rating, the Rams improved to an 11–5 record in 2017. Then in 2018, they won their first eight games and finished the year with a 13–3 record, tying the Saints for the best record in the NFC. The Rams offense ranked second in the NFL in both points scored (527) and yards gained (6,738). Goff continued to improve in his third season, setting new career highs in passing yards (4,688, fourth in the NFL), passing touchdowns (32), passer rating (101.1), rushing yards (108) and rushing touchdowns (two). His top receiver was Robert Woods, who caught 86 passes for 1,219 yards and 6 touchdowns. Brandin Cooks, an off-season pickup from the Patriots via trade, also made a big impact with 80 receptions for 1,204 yards and 5 scores. The team's #3 receiver, Cooper Kupp, suffered a season ending injury after catching 40 passes for 566 yards in 8 games, forcing Goff to rely heavily on other targets like Gerald Everett (32 receptions) and Josh Reynolds (29). Pro Bowl running back Todd Gurley was the team's leading rusher with 1,251 yards (fourth in the NFL) and 17 touchdowns, while also catching 59 passes for 580 yards and five more touchdowns. His 17 rushing touchdowns led the league, while his 22 total touchdowns gave him 132 points, fifth in the NFL. Running back C. J. Anderson, who made the Rams his third different team in 2018 after signing up with them in December, also was a key aspect of the running game, finishing the season with 405 yards and leading the team in rushing in both of their playoff victories. On special teams, JoJo Natson returned 26 punts for 280 yards, while kicker Greg Zuerlein made 87.1% of his field goals, including a franchise postseason record 57-yard kick to defeat the Saints in overtime in the NFC championship game. The Rams defense featured Pro Bowl defensive tackle Aaron Donald, who led the league in sacks with 20.5, as many sacks as the rest of the team combined. He also had 59 tackles (25 for loss), four forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. Veteran defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh was second on the team with 4.5 sacks, while also getting 59 tackles and recovering two fumbles. Pro Bowl linebacker Cory Littleton led the team in total tackles with 125, while also picking up four sacks, three interceptions and blocking two punts. The Rams also had a strong secondary, led by John Johnson (119 tackles and four interceptions), Marcus Peters (three interceptions), Lamarcus Joyner (78 tackles) and Aqib Talib. ===Playoffs=== In the playoffs, the Patriots earned a first-round bye as the AFC's second overall seed. In the divisional round, they defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 41–28, scoring touchdowns on five of their first six possessions. Brady passed for 343 yards and a touchdown, while running back Sony Michel rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns. They then defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 37–31 in the AFC Championship Game, scoring the game- winning touchdown in overtime. The Patriots held a 14–0 lead at halftime, before the Chiefs rallied to take the lead 21–17 in the fourth quarter. From there, both teams took turns taking the lead, until the Chiefs forced overtime with a 39-yard field goal by Harrison Butker to tie the game 31–31. In overtime, Rex Burkhead scored a two-yard touchdown to win the game. Michel ended up rushing for a combined total of 242 yards and five touchdowns in the Patriots' two playoff games, setting an NFL record for postseason rushing touchdowns by a rookie. In the AFC championship game, the Patriots defense held Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce, who had both gained over 1,300 receiving yards during the season, to a combined total of just four receptions for 65 yards. Meanwhile, the Rams also had a first-round bye as the NFC's second overall seed. They started off the divisional round by defeating the Dallas Cowboys 30–22. The Rams gained 273 yards on the ground with running backs Todd Gurley and C. J. Anderson rushing for over 100 yards each. They then defeated the New Orleans Saints 26–23 in the NFC Championship Game, scoring a game-winning field goal in overtime. The Saints jumped out to an early 13–0 first quarter lead, before the Rams rallied to close the lead to 13–10 at halftime. In the fourth quarter, Greg Zuerlein tied the game at 20–20, with just over 5 minutes remaining. The Saints moved the ball to the Rams' 13 yard line, but could not gain a first down. On third down, quarterback Drew Brees threw a pass to receiver Tommylee Lewis, who was covered by Nickell Robey-Coleman. Though Robey-Coleman knocked Lewis to the ground and the pass fell incomplete, no penalty was called and the Saints' Wil Lutz kicked a 31-yard field goal to take the lead. The Rams took possession and sent the game to overtime with a 48-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein. In overtime, Brees threw an interception on their first drive and Zuerlein kicked a 57-yard field goal to win the game. ===Pre-game notes=== The game was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI between the Patriots and the Rams; the Rams at the time were based in St. Louis. However, only one player, Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady, remained on either roster from that contest. Bill Belichick, the Patriots' head coach in the previous contest, also remained in that position for this game. Super Bowl LIII featured record setting age differences between each team's starting quarterbacks and head coaches, pitting 41-year-old Brady against 24-year-old Jared Goff, as well as 66-year- old Belichick against 33-year-old Sean McVay. The then-St. Louis Rams won their sole Super Bowl title in Atlanta, Super Bowl XXXIV, hosted at the now- demolished Georgia Dome in 2000, which was located adjacent to Mercedes-Benz Stadium. As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Rams elected to wear their royal blue and yellow throwback uniforms for the game, which they have previously worn for six home games including a home playoff game during the 2018 season. The Patriots wore their standard white away uniforms. Boston and Los Angeles teams of other professional sports have met in the championship rounds, popularizing the \\"Beat L.A.\\" chant and the hashtag \\"#BeatLA\\". The Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers have contested a record twelve NBA Finals. Furthermore, Los Angeles Galaxy and New England Revolution have contested three MLS Cups. The Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers faced off in the 2018 World Series, and with the Patriots and Rams meeting in Super Bowl LIII, it was only the second time in 50 years that two cities' MLB and NFL teams have competed for the league title in the same season (or calendar year), the first time being in 1969 when the New York Jets and Baltimore Colts competed for Super Bowl III in January 1969 followed by the 1969 World Series featuring the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles.https://www.mlb.com/cut4/patriots-and-rams-super-bowl-same- as-world-series-c302936260https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red- sox/2019/02/03/red-sox-patriots-championship-drought The Patriots faced another Los Angeles-based team in the same playoffs, the Chargers in the divisional round, en route to their Super Bowl meeting with the Rams. Associated events The Super Bowl Experience at the Georgia World Congress Center Pre-game events and entertainment were centered around Downtown Atlanta, with State Farm Arena having hosted Super Bowl Opening Night, the Georgia World Congress Center hosting the Super Bowl Experience and Super Bowl Live at Centennial Olympic Park. State Farm Arena also hosted the inaugural Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest, a three-night concert series that was headlined by Ludacris and Migos (night 1), Aerosmith and Post Malone (night 2), and Bruno Mars and Cardi B (night 3). The show competed with a \\"Super Saturday Night\\" concert held by DirecTV at a temporary venue near Atlantic Station, headlined by the Foo Fighters and featuring Roger Taylor, Zac Brown, Tom Morello, Perry Farrell and Dave Koz as special guests. The NFL officially launched its centennial commemorations at Super Bowl LIII, ahead of its 100th season. A themed, two-minute advertisement was aired during the game. ==BroadcastingUnited States=== CBS broadcast Super Bowl LIII as part of an annual cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL, marking the 20th time it has broadcast the game. As with CBS's most recent Super Bowl (Super Bowl 50), ESPN Deportes aired a Spanish-language broadcast of the game (additional to CBS's SAP channel Spanish version). CBS's coverage utilized a total of 115 cameras, including 8K resolution cameras (for the first time in a U.S. network sports telecast) in the end zones, as well as field-level and \\"up close\\" augmented reality graphics (with the latter generated from a wireless, handheld camera). Digitally, the game was available via the CBS Sports app, CBSSports.com, the Yahoo! Sports app, Tumblr app, the NFL app and through CBS's subscription service CBS All Access. The Yahoo! Sports app and Tumblr app streams are part of a long-term deal between then NFL and Verizon Media. Westwood One affiliates carried the game on radio for free, with SiriusXM carrying the game in eight languages and hometown broadcasts from Boston's WBZ-FM and Los Angeles's KSPN and KCBS-FM, along with the main feed on Sirius XM NFL Radio. Advertising With a base price slightly higher than $5 million for a 30-second ad, the cost of commercial time remained even with the previous three events. There were fewer spots sold overall in comparison to the previous Super Bowl; CBS aired more than double the number of promos for its own programming (as well as that of its subscription service CBS All Access) than NBC did at Super Bowl LII. Despite this, Kantar estimated its total revenue to be the third-highest in Super Bowl history, at $382 million. Perennial Super Bowl advertiser Anheuser-Busch made its largest-ever advertising purchase for a single game, with a total of eight different commercials of various lengths (covering five-and-a-half minutes of airtime) across seven product brands, including three being advertised during the game for the first time. CBS rejected an ad from medical cannabis company Acreage Holdings advocating for legalization. For the first time in its history, the NFL itself won USA Todays Super Bowl Ad Meter survey determining the best commercial aired during the game, with an advertisement launching a campaign celebrating its 100th season. Lead-out programs CBS's lead- out program was the series premiere of the talent competition series The World's Best. After late local programs, CBS also aired a special Sunday-night episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Ratings Initial overnight Nielsen Ratings measured a 44.9 rating for the game, down 5% from the previous year and the lowest rating for a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XLIII ten years prior. 98.2 million viewers were measured, the fewest since Super Bowl XLII. Jemele Hill of The Atlantic attributed the low ratings \\"to the game being the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, moderate national interest in the Rams, the lingering bad taste from the huge blown call in the NFC Championship Game, and Patriots fatigue\\". In New Orleans, whose Saints had lost the NFC Championship in part because of the blown call, ratings were down 51% compared to Super Bowl LII as Louisianans boycotted and refused to watch the game. Outside the Boston market, where the 57.1 overnight rating was the highest among local markets, the highest-rated markets were in Richmond, Virginia and Buffalo, New York (the latter having traditionally high ratings for sporting events and being the home of the Patriots' division rivals the Buffalo Bills); Los Angeles was near the national average. A downturn of approximately 5% was noted during the halftime show. The fewer television viewers did not migrate to online or mobile platforms; viewership online and on mobile only totaled 2.5 million viewers, which was not an appreciable enough change to affect the overall viewership decline. ===International=== In Canada, the game was aired by CTV, CTV 2 and TSN. Unifor purchased time on the Canadian broadcast to air an attack ad criticizing General Motors' decision to close the Oshawa Car Assembly plant, defying demands from the company to pull the ad because they deemed it to be misleading. In Australia and New Zealand, ESPN Australia aired an ESPN-produced broadcast of the game that featured the Monday Night Football commentary crew of Joe Tessitore, Jason Witten and Booger McFarland (McFarland was in the booth rather than the controversial sideline vehicle he used that was abandoned before the end of the 2018 MNF season). It would prove to be Witten's last commentary appearance for the time being, due to his unretirement and return to the Dallas Cowboys. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the game was broadcast on the free-to-air channel BBC One, and paid-subscription channels Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Mix and Sky Sports USA. ==Entertainment== The musical artists who agreed to perform at the show—including Gladys Knight, Maroon 5, Travis Scott, and Big Boi—were criticized by media outlets, other artists, and members of the public for performing at Super Bowl LIII because of the NFL's alleged blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick for protesting police brutality by kneeling during the pre- game national anthem. Several artists, including Jay-Z and Cardi B, turned down offers to perform at the game in support of Kaepernick. Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies became the first male cheerleaders to perform at a major US sporting event. Scott Winer was the first openly gay cameraman to film the Super Bowl. ===Pre-game=== The NFL had Mercedes-Benz Stadium's retractable roof open for the pre-game ceremonies, then closed it prior to kickoff. Atlanta natives Chloe x Halle performed \\"America the Beautiful\\". Gladys Knight, also from Atlanta, performed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". D.C. resident Aarron Loggins performed a sign-language interpretation for both songs. Bernice King—the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr.—and civil rights movement leaders Andrew Young and John Lewis participated in the coin toss ceremony. King had the honors of flipping the coin. ===Halftime show=== On January 13, 2019, the NFL announced that pop band Maroon 5 would headline the Super Bowl LIII halftime show. They were joined by Big Boi of Outkast and Travis Scott as guests. A short clip featuring the cast of SpongeBob SquarePants and a clip from the 2001 episode \\"Band Geeks\\" was aired as a tribute to series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died in November due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as a response to a petition on Change.org calling the NFL to have the song \\"Sweet Victory\\" performed at the halftime show. The full clip of the \\"Sweet Victory\\" song, including a dedication to Hillenburg, was played inside the stadium prior to the game. ==Game summaryFirst half=== The Patriots received first possession as Cordarrelle Patterson returned the opening kickoff 38 yards to the Patriots' 39-yard line and the team picked up 27 yards with their next five plays. But on Tom Brady's first pass attempt of the day, Nickell Robey-Coleman, who was notable for a non-pass interference call in the NFC Championship two weeks ago, deflected the ball, allowing linebacker Cory Littleton to make an interception. The turnover had no avail, and following a punt, the Patriots drove 45 yards in 11 plays, the longest a 19-yard catch by tight end Rob Gronkowski. Placekicker Stephen Gostkowski missed a field goal attempt from 46 yards, still keeping the score at zero. The Rams were again unable to move the ball and again, the Patriots threatened to score when Brady completed a 25-yard pass to Julian Edelman at the Rams 45-yard line. But on the next play, Brady was sacked by defensive end John Franklin-Myers and fumbled the ball. Center David Andrews recovered the fumble, but the team was only able to get as far as the Rams' 40 before 4th down and had to punt with 18 seconds left in the first quarter. After forcing another three-and-out, the Patriots managed to drive 39 yards in seven plays, most of which came from another 25-yard completion from Brady to Edelman. Gostkowski finished the possession with a 42-yard field goal, giving the team a 3–0 lead with 10:29 left in the second quarter. After the next three drives ended in punts, the Patriots took the ball and drove 36 yards to the Rams 32-yard line. But on a 4th-and-1 conversion attempt, Brady threw an incomplete pass with 1:16 left on the clock. The two teams went into their locker rooms with the Patriots leading, 3–0, the second lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history and the lowest since the 2–0 halftime score in Super Bowl IX after the 1974 season. In the entire first half, the Rams had gained just 57 yards and two first downs, both record lows for coach Sean McVay. This was also the first time that McVay's Rams had ever been shut out in a first half. ===Second half=== The defensive battle continued into the second half as both teams punted twice (one of them was a Super Bowl record 65-yard punt by the Rams' Johnny Hekker). With 6:33 left in the third quarter, the Rams opened their first drive of more than five plays and their first not to end in a punt, moving the ball 42 yards in 10 plays. On the third play of the drive, Jared Goff completed a 15-yard pass to Brandin Cooks and later made his first third-down conversion with an 18-yard pass to Robert Woods on 3rd-and-6. On 3rd-and-7 from the Patriots' 26-yard line, Goff was sacked for a 9-yard loss by Dont'a Hightower, but Greg Zuerlein was able to pull off a 53-yard field goal, the second-longest in Super Bowl history, to tie the game at 3–3 with 2:11 left in the third quarter. The Patriots took the ball back and drove to the Rams' 44-yard line, but could not go any further, and had to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter. For the first time in Super Bowl history, both teams had gone three quarters without scoring a touchdown. After forcing the Rams to punt, the Patriots mounted the longest drive of the game as Brady completed an 18-yard pass to Gronkowski, a 13-yard pass to Edelman, a 7-yard pass to running back Rex Burkhead and a 29-yard pass to Gronkowski, bringing them to the Rams' 2-yard line. On the next play, Sony Michel gave the Patriots the lead with a touchdown run, extending his rookie postseason rushing touchdown record to six. With the extra point by Gostkowski, the Patriots had a 10–3 lead with seven minutes left in regulation. On the first play of the Rams' next drive, Goff completed a 19-yard pass to Cooks and later converted a 3rd-and-9 with an 11-yard throw to Josh Reynolds. On the next play, his 17-yard completion to Woods moved the ball to the Patriots' 27-yard line. But with just over 4 minutes left in the game, Goff threw a pass that was intercepted by Stephon Gilmore on the 3-yard line. The Rams needed to force a punt or turnover, but were unable to contain the Patriots on the ground. On the second play of the Patriots' possession, Michel stormed through the line for a 26-yard run. After he picked up 10 more yards with his next two carries, Burkhead's 26-yard run gave the Patriots a first down on the Rams' 33-yard line. Three plays later, Gostkowski succeeded on a 41-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 13–3 lead with 1:12 left on the clock. Taking the ball back on their own 25, Goff completed a 10-yard pass to Woods, as well as completions to Cooks for gains of 24 and 21 yards, moving the ball to the Patriots' 30-yard line. With 8 seconds left, the Rams decided to kick a field goal, which would have been followed by an onside kick attempt, but Zuerlein missed wide left from 48 yards, and the Patriots ran out the last few seconds of the game clock. ===Totals=== Brady completed 21 of 35 passes for 262 yards, with one interception. Edelman was his top target with 10 receptions for 141 yards, while Gronkowski made six receptions for 87 yards in his final game with the Patriots (he announced his retirement in March 2019. He returned for the 2020 season, but only after being traded to Tampa Bay). Michel was the top rusher of the game with 94 yards and a touchdown. Gilmore had five solo tackles and an interception. Goff finished the day 19-for-38 passing, for 229 yards and an interception. Cooks was his top receiver with eight receptions for 120 yards. Littleton had 10 tackles (six solo) and an interception. Hekker punted nine times for 417 yards, an average of 46.3 yards per punt, and put five punts inside the 20. The Rams were only the second team in Super Bowl history to not score a touchdown, the first having been the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI after the 1971 season. Brady became the first player in NFL history to win six Super Bowls, surpassing Charles Haley's sole record of five. Brady, also, at age 41, became the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and Bill Belichick became the oldest coach to win a Super Bowl, at age 66. Edelman was named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player, the first wide receiver so recognized since Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII after the 2008 season. Despite holding the Rams to just three points, no Patriots defender received a vote. ===Box score=Final statisticsStatistical comparison=== {  - !Statistic !New England Patriots !Los Angeles Rams - First downs 22  14 - First downs rushing 6  2 - First downs passing 12  11 - First downs penalty 4  1 - Third down efficiency 3/12  3/13 - Fourth down efficiency 0/1  0/0 - Total net yards 407  260 - Net yards rushing 154  62 - Rushing attempts 32  18 - Yards per rush 4.8  3.4 - Yards passing 253  198 - Passing–completions/attempts 21/35  19/38 - Times sacked–total yards 1–9  4–31 - Interceptions thrown 1  1 - Punt returns–total yards 2–2  2–12 - Kickoff returns–total yards 1–38  1–27 - Interceptions–total return yards 1–0  1–0 - Punts–average yardage 5–43  9–46.3 - Fumbles–lost 1–0  1–0 - Penalties–yards 3–20  9–65 - Time of possession 33:10  26:50 - Turnovers 1  1 } {  - !colspan=3Records set -  Most appearances, team  11  rowspan=\\"2\\"  New England Patriots -  Fewest points scored, winning team  13 - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Most consecutive drives ending with a punt  8  Los Angeles Rams - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Fewest touchdowns, first 3 quarters (both teams)  0  rowspan=\\"6\\"  Super Bowl LIII -  Fewest touchdowns (both teams, game)  1 -  Fewest PATs (both teams, game)  1 -  Fewest kickoff returns (both teams, game)  2 -  Fewest points, first 3 quarters (both teams)  6 -  Fewest points (both teams, game)  16 - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Most appearances, player  9  rowspan=\\"10\\"  Tom Brady (New England) -  Most appearances, starting player  9 -  Most wins, player  6 -  Most NFL championships won, player 6 -  Most pass attempts, player (career)  392 -  Most pass completions, player (career)  256 -  Most passing yards, player (career)  2,838 -  Oldest quarterback, player  41 years, 183 days -  Oldest quarterback, starting player  41 years, 183 days -  Oldest quarterback to win  41 years, 183 days - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Most appearances, head coach  9  rowspan=\\"7\\" Bill Belichick (New England) -  Most appearances, coach  12 -  Most appearances, any capacity  12 -  Most won, head coach  6 -  Most won, coach  8 -  Most won, any capacity  8 -  Oldest head coach, winning team  66 years, 293 days - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Most appearances, kicker  6  Stephen Gostkowski (New England) - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\" Most receptions, tight end (career) 23 Rob Gronkowski (New England) - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Youngest head coach  33 years, 10 days  Sean McVay (Los Angeles Rams) - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Longest punt  65 yards  Johnny Hekker (Los Angeles Rams) - !colspan=3Records tied -  Most wins, team  6  rowspan=\\"3\\"  New England Patriots -  Most first downs by penalty, team  4 -  Fewest touchdowns scored, winning team  1 - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Fewest points, first half  0  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Los Angeles Rams -  Fewest points scored, team  3 -  Fewest touchdowns scored, team  0 - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Fewest points, first quarter (both teams)  0  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Super Bowl LIII -  Fewest passing touchdowns (both teams)  0 -  Fewest fumbles lost (both teams)  0 - style=\\"border- top: 2px solid blue\\"  Most NFL championships won, head coach 6  Bill Belichick (New England) - style=\\"border-top: 2px solid blue\\"  Most receptions, first half  7  Julian Edelman (New England) - style=\\"border- top: 2px solid blue\\"  Most field goals, career  7  Stephen Gostkowski (New England) } ===Individual statistics=== {  - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Patriots passing - ! !C/ATT1 !Yds !TD !INT !Rating -  Tom Brady  21/35  262  0  1  71.4 - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Patriots rushing - ! !Car2 !Yds !TD !Lg3 !Yds/Car -  Sony Michel  18  94  1  26  5.2 -  Rex Burkhead  7  43  0  26  6.1 -  Julian Edelman  1  8  0  8  8.0 -  Cordarrelle Patterson  2  7  0  6  3.5 -  James White  2  4  0  3  2.0 -  Tom Brady  2  −2  0  −1  –1.0 - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Patriots receiving - ! !Rec4 !Yds !TD !Lg3 !Target5 -  Julian Edelman  10  141  0  27  12 -  Rob Gronkowski  6  87  0  29  7 -  Rex Burkhead  2  15  0  8  2 -  Cordarrelle Patterson  2  14  0  9  2 -  James White  1  5  0  5  4 -  Chris Hogan  0  0  0  0  6 -  Sony Michel  0  0  0  0  2 } {  - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Rams passing - ! !C/ATT1 !Yds !TD !INT !Rating -  Jared Goff  19/38  229  0  1  57.9 - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Rams rushing - ! !Car2 !Yds !TD !Lg3 !Yds/Car -  Todd Gurley  10  35  0  16  3.5 -  C.

The date of the parade was unseasonably warm for New England. The high temperature for the day was 65 degrees Fahrenheit, with a low of 40. Temperatures in Boston during this time of year average in the mid to low 40’s. It was attended by an estimated 1.5 million fans. ==ReferencesSuper Bowl 53 Category:2018 National Football League season Category:2019 in American football Category:2019 in sports in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:2019 in Atlanta Category:American football in Atlanta Category:2019 in American television Category:February 2019 sports events in the United States Category:Los Angeles Rams postseason Category:New England Patriots postseason ","title":"Super Bowl LIII"},{"id":"46761380","text":"Super Bowl LIV was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2019 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers 31–20, marking their first Super Bowl victory since Super Bowl IV and the Chiefs' first NFL championship since joining the league in the AFL–NFL merger. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, having completed 26 of 42 pass attempts for 286 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, and well as rushing for 29 yards and one touchdown. The game was played on February 2, 2020, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. This was the eleventh Super Bowl hosted by the South Florida region and the sixth Super Bowl hosted in Miami Gardens, which hosted Super Bowl XLIV ten years earlier. This was also the first Super Bowl in seven years to not feature quarterbacks Tom Brady or Peyton Manning. The first half of the game was back and forth between both teams, with the game tied at 10 at halftime. In the third quarter, the 49ers began to pull away, with a Robbie Gould field goal and a touchdown run by Raheem Mostert giving them a 20–10 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, over the final 6:13 of the game, the Chiefs offense completed two touchdown drives with Mahomes throwing touchdown passes to Travis Kelce and Damien Williams, to take the lead just before the two- minute warning. The Chiefs then stopped the 49ers on defense, and a late touchdown run by Damien Williams, as well as a Kendall Fuller interception, sealed the victory and ended the Chiefs' 50-year championship drought. The game's broadcast in the United States by Fox, along with the halftime show headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, was seen by an estimated 102 million viewers—a slight increase over Super Bowl LIII in 2019 (which had seen the smallest audience for the game in 10 years). Due to the seating capacity of Hard Rock Stadium, this game also had the second lowest attendance in Super Bowl history (after Super Bowl I) and the lowest since the merger. ==BackgroundHost selection process=== left left On May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host either Super Bowl LIII in 2019 or Super Bowl LIV. NFL owners voted on these cities in May 2016, with the first round of voting determining who would host Super Bowl LIII, and the second round deciding the site for Super Bowl LIV. The league had also originally announced in 2015 that Los Angeles would be eligible as a potential Super Bowl LIV site if there is a stadium in place, and a team moved there by the start of the 2018 season. The league opened the relocation window in January 2016, selecting the former St. Louis Rams to return to Los Angeles; their new stadium in Inglewood, California was, at the time of the vote, not scheduled to open until August 2019 (it began construction in November 2016, giving nearly three years to construct the stadium). This meant the new stadium was scheduled to be open in time for the game (and the league selected the relocating team just in time to be considered for Super Bowl LIV), but, under the current construction timetable, would require a waiver of league policy to host Super Bowl LIV, as the league does not allow stadiums in their first year of existence to host the Super Bowl to ensure stadium construction delays and unforeseen problems do not jeopardize the game. In May 2016, the league granted this waiver and confirmed that Los Angeles was still in consideration for Super Bowl LIV. The two remaining finalists for Super Bowl LIV were Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, which last hosted Super Bowl XLIV in 2010; and Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, which last hosted Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. Miami was selected as the host site at the NFL owners meeting on May 24, 2016. ===Teams=== San Francisco 49ers Garoppolo in 2019 The San Francisco 49ers finished the 2019 season with an NFC-best record under third-year head coach Kyle Shanahan. San Francisco's rise to the top came as a surprise to the league, as they had finished the previous season and had not recorded a winning record since 2013.2019 San Francisco 49ers Statistics & Players pro-football-reference.com One big reason for the 49ers' success was the emergence of QB Jimmy Garoppolo. Garoppolo began his career in 2014 as a backup to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, winning Super Bowls XLIX and LI. After two uneventful seasons, Garoppolo's playing time increased substantially in 2016, due to Brady being suspended and several cases of large late-game leads. Garoppolo showed potential, with a 113.3 passer rating over a span of six games. In the following year, with San Francisco struggling at , they traded a second round draft pick for Garoppolo, who led the 49ers to five straight wins to finish the season. Although he missed most of the 2018 season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ironically, the injury was sustained vs. the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium), Garoppolo recovered in time for the 2019 season, starting all 16 games. San Francisco's offense finished second in the NFL in points scored (479) and fourth in yards (6,079). Garoppolo completed 69.1% of his passes (fourth in the NFL) for 3,978 yards and 27 touchdowns (fifth), with 13 interceptions. His top pass-catcher was Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle, who caught 85 passes for 1,053 yards and five touchdowns. Other key targets included rookie Deebo Samuel (57 receptions, 807 yards, 159 rushing yards, six total touchdowns) and veteran Emmanuel Sanders (36 receptions, 502 yards, three touchdowns). The 49ers ground game was led by the emergence of running back (RB) Raheem Mostert, who had bounced around five different teams in his first two seasons before settling into San Francisco in 2017. Although Mostert had not started any games in 2019, he led the team in rushing with 772 yards and eight touchdowns, with an average of 5.6 yards per carry, while also catching 14 passes for 180 yards and two more touchdowns. RBs Matt Breida (623 rushing yards, 19 receptions) and Tevin Coleman (544 rushing yards, 21 receptions, 180 receiving yards, seven total touchdowns) also made a big impact on offense, while FB Kyle Juszczyk made the Pro Bowl, catching 20 passes for 239 yards. San Francisco's offensive line was led by 13-year veteran tackle Joe Staley, a six-time Pro Bowl selection. The 49ers defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest yards allowed (4,509) and first in fewest passing yards (2,707). The team had an outstanding defensive line, featuring linemen DeForest Buckner (61 tackles, 7.5sacks, four fumble recoveries), Arik Armstead (54 tackles, 10 sacks), Dee Ford (6.5 sacks), an offseason pickup from the Chiefs, and Pro Bowl rookie Nick Bosa (47 tackles, nine sacks, two fumble recoveries). The team's linebacking corps was led by Fred Warner (team leading 118 tackles, three sacks, three forced fumbles) and PFWA all-rookie Dre Greenlaw (64 tackles, one sack). Defensive back Richard Sherman led the team in interceptions with three, earning his fifth career Pro Bowl selection before going on to add two more interceptions in the playoffs. This was the 49ers' seventh Super Bowl appearance, and their first since Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens 34–31. The 49ers have a record in their previous six appearances. A sixth Super Bowl victory would have tied the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers with the most Super Bowl championships in the league. Kansas City Chiefs Mahomes in 2017. The Kansas City Chiefs finished the 2019 season with a record under Andy Reid, who was serving in his 21st consecutive season as an NFL head coach. The 2019 season marked the Chiefs' fourth straight AFC West title and sixth playoff appearance in seven seasons under Reid. Patrick Mahomes, their first round draft pick from 2017, quarterbacked the team. Mahomes won the NFL MVP award in the 2018 season, throwing for 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns as he led the Chiefs to a record, along with a trip to the AFC championship game. In 2019, the team had to overcome some important personnel losses. Two of their top players from 2018, running back Kareem Hunt and linebacker Dee Ford, played elsewhere in 2019, while Mahomes and wide receiver Tyreek Hill both missed multiple games with injuries. Still, the team was able to repeat a record and earn the No.2 seed. Mahomes was selected for the 2020 Pro Bowl, despite missing two games due to a dislocated patella; he threw passes for 4,031 yards and 26 touchdowns with only five interceptions, and rushed for 218 yards and two touchdowns. In the two games Mahomes missed, backup Matt Moore filled in and threw for 659 yards and six touchdowns, with no interceptions. The Chiefs' passing attack was ranked second in the NFL. Mahomes' top receiver was Pro Bowl tight end Travis Kelce, who caught 97 passes for 1,229 yards and five touchdowns, making him the first NFL tight end to have four consecutive thousand-yard seasons. His other targets included Hill, who earned his fourth Pro Bowl selection despite missing four games, catching 58 passes for 860 yards and seven touchdowns, Sammy Watkins with 52 catches for 673 yards and three touchdowns, and Demarcus Robinson with 32 catches for 449 yards and three touchdowns. Rookie receiver Mecole Hardman added 26 catches for 538 yards and six touchdowns. On special teams, Hardman ranked third in the NFL in kickoff return yards (704) and fifth in return average (26.1 yards), while also returning 18 punts for 167 yards, earning him a Pro Bowl selection as a special teams returner. The Chiefs' running game was ranked 23rd in the league, led by Damien Williams, who was their leading rusher with 498 yards and five touchdowns, while also catching 30 passes for 213 yards and two more scores. LeSean McCoy also contributed 465 yards and four touchdowns, along with 28 receptions. Kicker Harrison Butker led the NFL in scoring (147 points) and field goals (34), while ranking sixth in field goal percentage (89.4%). The Chiefs' offense was ranked fifth in the NFL in points scored (451) and sixth in yards gained (6,067). Kansas City's defense ranked seventh in league in points allowed (308). Their defensive line featured two Pro Bowl selections, Chris Jones who recorded nine sacks and Frank Clark who had eight sacks and three forced fumbles, along with Emmanuel Ogbah who had 5.5 sacks in only 10 games played. Linebackers Anthony Hitchens and Damien Wilson led the team in tackles with 88 and 81. The Chiefs defense was bolstered late in the season when they claimed off waivers 16-year veteran linebacker Terrell Suggs, who was picked up after being cut from the Arizona Cardinals in week 14. Suggs finished the season with 4forced fumbles and 6.5 sacks. Tyrann Mathieu, in his first season with the Chiefs, tallied four interceptions, two sacks and 75 tackles, which was enough to earn his second career AP first-team All-Pro selection as a defensive back. He was also listed second-team All-Pro as a safety. Rookie safety Juan Thornhill added three interceptions and 57 tackles, but was lost for the season with a torn ACL in week 17. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland had two interceptions and two fumble recoveries, which he returned for 114 yards and a touchdown. This was the Chiefs' third Super Bowl appearance and their first since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. The Chiefs were in their two previous Super Bowl appearances: they lost Super BowlI in 1967, to the Green Bay Packers, 35–10, and won Super Bowl IV in 1970, defeating the Minnesota Vikings, 23–7. This was also Andy Reid's second Super Bowl appearance as a head coach, after Super Bowl XXXIX in 2004 when he was Philadelphia Eagles head coach, which they lost 24–21 to the New England Patriots. Entering Super Bowl LIV, Reid's 221 career victories made him the NFL coach with the most wins without a Super Bowl championship. ===Playoffs=== In the playoffs, the 49ers earned a first-round bye as the NFC's first seed. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 27–10. The 49ers dominated this game, outperforming the Vikings in time of possession (38:27–21:33), first downs (21–7), rushing yards (186–21) and total yards (308–147). In the NFC Championship Game, the 49ers led by 27–0 at half time over the Green Bay Packers on their way to a 37–20 win. San Francisco set the record for the fewest passes in an NFC championship victory, throwing the ball only eight times. Instead they relied mostly on their running game, with 42 rushes for 285 yards, including a franchise record 220 yards and four touchdowns by Raheem Mostert. Meanwhile, the Chiefs also had a first-round bye as the AFC's second seed. In the Divisional Round, they fell behind 24–0 to the Houston Texans, but rallied to take a 28–24 half time lead; they dominated the second half and ended with a 51–31 win. During the comeback, the Chiefs scored touchdowns on an NFL record seven consecutive drives, including five on Mahomes passes. Their next opponent was the 6th-seeded Tennessee Titans, who advanced to the AFC championship by beating the New England Patriots and Baltimore Ravens, mainly due to the dominating performance of running back Derrick Henry, who gained over 200 yards from scrimmage in each game. The Chiefs defeated the Titans, holding Henry to just 61 total yards, with negative yardage in the second half. Kansas City rallied back from a 17–7 deficit in the second quarter by scoring four unanswered touchdowns to win the game 35–24. Mahomes threw 294 yards and three touchdowns, and also led Kansas City in rushing with 53 yards on the ground, including a 27-yard touchdown scramble. ===Pre-game notes=== The Chiefs were the designated home team for Super Bowl LIV, as the home team alternates between the two conferences annually. As the designated home team, the Chiefs elected to wear their standard red home jerseys with white pants. The 49ers wore their standard white away jerseys with gold pants. This was the first time two teams with red as a primary uniform color met in the Super Bowl. The 49ers reportedly sought special permission to wear their all-white third jersey combination, which would have required special approval from the league; no such approval was granted. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan joined his father Mike Shanahan as the first father-son duo to lead their teams to a Super Bowl as head coaches. The elder Shanahan previously won Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII as head coach of the Denver Broncos. 49ers offensive assistant Katie Sowers became the first woman and the first openly gay person to coach in any Super Bowl. Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, who played for both teams during his NFL career, joked on Twitter saying: \\"You heard from me first. I guarantee my team will win the Super Bowl!\\" Marlins Park hosted Super Bowl Opening Night. Bayfront Park hosted Super Bowl Live, while the Miami Beach Convention Center hosted the Super Bowl Experience. === Team Facilities === The Chiefs used the Miami Dolphins practice facility in Davie and stayed at the JW Marriott Turnberry. The 49ers practiced at the University of Miami in Coral Gables and stayed at the JW Marriott Marquis. ==BroadcastingUnited States=== Super Bowl LIV was televised by Fox (per the three-year rotation between CBS, Fox, and NBC, the NFL's three network broadcast partners) along with Fox Deportes in Spanish. Digitally, the game was available via Fox Sports' streaming platforms, the Yahoo! Sports app, and the NFL app. The Yahoo! Sports app and stream is part of a long-term deal between the NFL and Verizon Media. The broadcast team for Fox consisted of Joe Buck on play-by-play and Troy Aikman on color commentary. Buck's father Jack had announced the Chiefs' Super Bowl win 50 years prior for CBS Sports. Production Similarly to its Thursday Night Football broadcasts, Fox produced its Super Bowl LIV broadcast in 1080p high definition with Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) high-dynamic-range (HDR) color, upconverted to a 4K ultra high definition feed available through participating pay TV providers and the Fox Sports app on supported streaming devices. Fox ruled out a native 4K telecast, citing the intensive internal bandwidth requirements needed to process 4K camera feeds during a telecast of this scale. Fox also introduced a new on-air appearance for football telecasts (which also included Fox's XFL broadcasts that began the following weekend). Fox's new graphics included a new scoreboard, which also included real-time QB and rushing statistics between plays, as well as the use of illustrated portraits of key players as opposed to photos. Fox constructed a broadcast plaza in South Beach along Ocean Drive, which originated FS1's studio programs during the week leading up to the game, and served as the main location for its pre-game show. The campus also featured public activities such as the \\"Fox VIP Screening Room\\", a Lego sculpture exhibit promoting the upcoming Fox series Lego Masters, and a The Masked Singer-themed ferris wheel. Advertising Fox charged $5.0 million to $5.6 million for thirty seconds of commercial time during Super Bowl LIV. On November 22, 2019, Fox announced that it had sold its entire in-game advertising inventory. As part of NFL initiatives to adjust and optimize commercial load during games, Fox aired four breaks per quarter rather than five, but each break was longer. Fox's executive vice president of sports sales Seth Winter said these changes had increased the early demand for commercial time during the game. Two candidates in the 2020 presidential election bought spots during the game, including the re-election campaign of Donald Trump, and Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg. The game fell on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, the first major contest of the 2020 Democratic primaries. It was reported that due to concerns from other advertisers, only Fox network promos would air alongside the political ads during their respective breaks. In contrast to its largest collection of Super Bowl ad buys in 2019, perennial sponsor Anheuser-Busch purchased only four 60-second spots, fewer than previous years. The Super Bowl Ad Meter survey conducted by USA Today was won by a Groundhog Day-themed spot for the Jeep Gladiator (tying into the game itself falling on Groundhog Day), starring Bill Murray. Lead-out programs On May 13, 2019, Fox announced that its lead-out program would be the season 3 premiere of The Masked Singer. Ratings Fox reported an overall digital, broadcast, and subscription audience of 102 million, an increase of 1.3 million from Super Bowl LIII. Nielsen Ratings measured 99.9 million viewers to the main Fox broadcast, also up from the 98.2 million who had watched Super Bowl LIII on CBS, while the Fox Deportes Spanish broadcast drew 310,000 viewers. An uptick to 103 million was noted during the halftime show. Viewership declined at a rate of approximately five million viewers per hour over the course of the game. Radio Nationally, Westwood One broadcast the game in the United States. Kevin Harlan, himself a former Chiefs radio broadcaster from 1985 to 1993, called the play-by-play, joined in the booth by Kurt Warner on color commentary; Laura Okmin and Tony Boselli contributed sideline reports, while Gene Steratore served as rules analyst. Locally, each team's flagship station, KNBR/KSAN in San Francisco and KCFX in Kansas City (all Cumulus Media stations), also carried the game in their local metropolitan areas. For Kansas City, Mitch Holthus was on play-by-play with Kendall Gammon on color commentary and B.J. Kissel with sideline reports, while San Francisco had Greg Papa on play-by-play with Tim Ryan on color commentary.Here's how to watch and stream the Super Bowl on Sunday Sacramento Bee, February 2, 2020 By coincidence, it was KCFX's last Chiefs game under a 30 year-long contract, as the team's games will move to Entercom's WDAF-FM in the 2020 season. ===International=== In Canada, Super Bowl LIV was televised by CTV, TSN, RDS (in French), and DAZN. In December 2019, considering an appeal of a prior decision at the request of Bell Media, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned a ruling that had allowed the CRTC to restrict use of the simultaneous substitution (simsub) regulations for the Super Bowl in order to allow access to the U.S. commercials (which they had deemed, by public response, to be an integral part of the telecast). The court held that the CRTC's exception in policy overstepped its power under the Broadcasting Act, citing that it does not allow the CRTC to \\"impose terms and conditions on the distribution of programming services generally\\".

The victims were honored in a tribute, with 49ers and Chiefs players lined up at opposite 24-yard lines in homage to Bryant's jersey number 24. Players and coaches selected to the NFL's 100th Anniversary All-Time Team were introduced in an on-field ceremony. Those living members in attendance wore red jackets with the NFL's 100th anniversary patch on them. Yolanda Adams performed \\"America the Beautiful\\", while Demi Lovato performed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". Four 100-year-old World War II veterans participated in the coin toss ceremony: Colonel Charles E. McGee, Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Lombardo, Staff Sergeant Odón Sanchez Cardenas, and Corporal Sidney Walton. McGee had the honors of presenting the coin. ===Halftime show=== The halftime show was led by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. Guests performers J Balvin and Bad Bunny featured during the show, as well as Lopez's daughter, Emme Muñiz. Lopez's five outfits were designed by Versace, and her styling team designed 213 costumes and 143 pairs of shoes for Jennifer and her dancers. Shakira's three outfits were by Norwegian designer Peter Dundas and featured nearly two million Swarovski crystals. The show was produced by NFL Network, Jay-Z and Roc Nation. The primary sponsor was Pepsi. ==Game summaryFirst half=== San Francisco won the coin toss and deferred, allowing the Chiefs to start with the ball. After forcing the Chiefs to punt on the opening drive, San Francisco drove 62 yards in 10 plays, including a 32-yard run by receiver Deebo Samuel. Robbie Gould finished the drive with a 38-yard field goal to give the 49ers a 3–0 lead. Kansas City responded by driving 75 yards in 15 plays. Patrick Mahomes completed five of seven passes for 40 yards on the drive, while Damien Williams rushed four times for 26 yards. Mahomes scored on a one-yard touchdown run to give the Chiefs a 7–3 lead with 31 seconds left in the first quarter. On the second play of the second quarter, a heavy pass rush forced 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to throw a hurried pass that was intercepted by defensive back Bashaud Breeland, giving Kansas City a first down on their own 44-yard line. Mahomes completed a 28-yard pass to Sammy Watkins on the next play, sparking a 43-yard drive that ended with Harrison Butker kicking a 31-yard field goal, giving the Chiefs a 10–3 lead. San Francisco responded by moving the ball 80 yards in seven plays, with five plays gaining more than 10 yards each. On the last play, Garoppolo threw the ball to fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who managed to make the catch through tight coverage by safety Daniel Sorensen, break a tackle attempt by Sorensen, and then dive into the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown. The game was tied at 10–10 with five minutes left in the half. After a Kansas City punt, Garoppolo's 42-yard pass to George Kittle could have set San Francisco up in the red zone, but that was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty against Kittle. Now pushed back to their own 35-yard line, the 49ers let the remaining six seconds expire to end the half with the score tied 10–10, the fourth time a Super Bowl had been tied at the midway point.Chiefs mount double-digit fourth-quarter rally for first Super Bowl title in 50 years KSHB, February 2, 2020 ===Second half=== San Francisco took the second half kickoff and drove 60 yards in nine plays, with Emmanuel Sanders catching two passes for 20 yards, Samuel rushing for 14 yards, and Juszczyk hauling in a 14-yard reception. Gould finished the drive with a 42-yard field goal, giving the 49ers a 13–10 lead. Linebacker Fred Warner intercepted Mahomes on the next drive, returning it three yards to the San Francisco 45-yard line. Garoppolo started the ensuing drive with a 16-yard pass to Samuel. Three plays later, on 3rd and 8, he threw a 26-yard pass to receiver Kendrick Bourne, and then followed it up with a 10-yard pass to Juszczyk on the Chiefs 1-yard line. Raheem Mostert ran the ball into the end zone on the next play, increasing the 49ers' lead to 20–10 with 2:35 left in the third quarter. On Kansas City's next drive, they drove the ball to the 49ers 23-yard line. On a 3rd and 6, Mahomes threw a pass intended for Tyreek Hill that was slightly behind the receiver. Hill tried to reach back for it, but the ball bounced off his arm and was intercepted by cornerback Tarvarius Moore, who returned it seven yards to the 49ers 20-yard line with 11:57 left in the game. After the Chiefs defense rallied to force a punt, Kansas City got the ball with 8:53 left in the game, and went on to score touchdowns on their next three drives. First, they moved the ball 62 yards in 10 plays. After a challenge by San Francisco succeeded in overturning a completed pass, the Chiefs faced 3rd and 15 with 7:13 left in the game. Mahomes called the play \\"Jet Chip Wasp\\", which resulted in a 44-yard completion from Mahomes to Hill from the Chiefs 35-yard line. Two plays later, Moore committed pass interference while trying to cover tight end Travis Kelce in the end zone, moving the ball 20 yards to the 49ers one-yard line, and Mahomes threw to Kelce for a touchdown on the next play. San Francisco had to punt after three plays, and Kansas City quickly stormed back for another score, advancing 65 yards in seven plays, the longest a 38-yard completion from Mahomes to Watkins. On 3rd and goal from the 49ers 5-yard line, Mahomes threw the ball to Williams, who just managed to stretch the ball across the goal line before going out of bounds. The touchdown was a close call, but was upheld by a booth review, giving Kansas City a 24–20 lead with 2:44 remaining in the game. In response, San Francisco quickly drove to the Chiefs 49-yard line. After three incomplete passes, Garoppolo was sacked by Frank Clark, resulting in a turnover on downs with 1:33 left in the game. Trying to run out the clock with the ground game, Williams carried the ball on the next two plays, first picking up four yards and then went the distance for a 38-yard touchdown to increase Kansas City's lead to 31–20 with 1:12 remaining in the game. Chiefs defensive back Kendall Fuller made an interception on the 49ers following drive, allowing the Chiefs to run out the clock and secure the Super Bowl, their first in 50 years and second overall. ===Postgame=== Trophy presentation after the game Mahomes finished the game with 26 completions on 42 attempts for 286 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions, while also rushing for 29 yards and a touchdown, gaining him the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award (MVP). He joined Terry Bradshaw and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to win the MVP despite throwing multiple interceptions. He was also the youngest player ever to win the award at 24 years and 138 days. Other notable statistical performances included Hill's nine receptions for 105 yards and Watkins' five catches for 98 yards. Williams was the top rusher of the game with 17 carries for 104 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 29 yards and another score. For San Francisco, Garoppolo completed 20 of 31 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. Samuel had three carries for 53 yards, setting the Super Bowl record for rushing yards by a wide receiver, and caught five passes for 39 yards. With this win, Kansas City became the first NFL team to come back from a 10-point (or more) deficit in three playoff games in the same season. The Chiefs Super Bowl win also completed a ten year stretch in which each current Missouri-based team in the four major American sports leagues won a title (joining the St. Louis Cardinals who won the 2011 World Series, the Kansas City Royals who won the 2015 World Series, and the St. Louis Blues who won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals). In addition, Sporting Kansas City, Kansas City's Major League Soccer franchise, won the MLS Cup in 2013. ===Box score=Final statisticsStatistical comparison=== {  +Team-to-Team Comparison - !Statistic !San Francisco 49ers !Kansas City Chiefs - First downs 21  26 - First downs rushing 8  12 - First downs passing 13  13 - First downs penalty 0  1 - Third down efficiency 3/8  6/14 - Fourth down efficiency 0/1  2/3 - Total net yards 351  397 - Net yards rushing 141 129 - Rushing attempts 22  29 - Yards per rush 6.4  4.4 - Yards passing 210  286 - Passing–completions/attempts 20/31  26/42 - Times sacked–total yards 1–9  4–18 - Interceptions thrown 2  2 - Punt returns–total yards 1–0  0–0 - Kickoff returns–total yards 4–61  3–58 - Interceptions–total return yards 2–10  2–11 - Punts–average yardage 2–43  2–40 - Fumbles–lost 1–0  3–0 - Penalties–yards 5–45  4–24 - Time of possession 26:47  33:13 - Turnovers 2  2 } {  +Records set - !colspan=3(Unless noted as \\"NFL Championships\\", all records refer only to Super Bowls) -  Most rushing yards, wide receiver  53   Deebo Samuel (San Francisco) - !colspan=3Records tied -  Most Touchdowns, Quarter, player  2  Damien Williams (Kansas City) -  Most points, 4th Quarter, team  21  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Kansas City Chiefs -  Most 4th Down Conversions, Game, team  2 -  Fewest Punts Returned, Game, team  0 -  Fewest Punts Return Yards, Game, both teams  0  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Super Bowl LIV -  Fewest Fumbles Lost, Game, both teams  0 } ===Individual statistics=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" +San Francisco statistics - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"49ers passing - !scope=\\"col\\" !scope=\\"col\\"C/ATT !scope=\\"col\\"Yds !scope=\\"col\\"TD !scope=\\"col\\"INT !scope=\\"col\\"Rating - !scope=\\"row\\"Jimmy Garoppolo 20/31 219 1 2 69.2 - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"49ers rushing - !scope=\\"col\\" !scope=\\"col\\"Car !scope=\\"col\\"Yds !scope=\\"col\\"TD !scope=\\"col\\"Lg !scope=\\"col\\"Yds/Car - !scope=\\"row\\"Raheem Mostert 12 58 1 17 4.8 - !scope=\\"row\\"Deebo Samuel 3 53 0 32 17.7 - !scope=\\"row\\"Tevin Coleman 5 28 0 17 5.6 - !scope=\\"row\\"Jimmy Garoppolo 2 2 0 3 1 - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"49ers receiving - !scope=\\"col\\" !scope=\\"col\\"Rec !scope=\\"col\\"Yds !scope=\\"col\\"TD !scope=\\"col\\"Lg !scope=\\"col\\"Target - !scope=\\"row\\"Deebo Samuel 5 39 0 16 9 - !scope=\\"row\\"George Kittle 4 36 0 12 7 - !scope=\\"row\\"Kyle Juszczyk 3 39 1 15 3 - !scope=\\"row\\"Emmanuel Sanders 3 38 0 18 5 - !scope=\\"row\\"Kendrick Bourne 2 42 0 26 4 - !scope=\\"row\\"Jeff Wilson 1 20 0 20 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Tevin Coleman 1 3 0 3 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Raheem Mostert 1 2 0 2 1 } { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" +Kansas City statistics - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Chiefs passing - !scope=\\"col\\" !scope=\\"col\\"C/ATT !scope=\\"col\\"Yds !scope=\\"col\\"TD !scope=\\"col\\"INT !scope=\\"col\\"Rating - !scope=\\"row\\"Patrick Mahomes 26/42 286 2 2 78.1 - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Chiefs rushing - !scope=\\"col\\" !scope=\\"col\\"Car !scope=\\"col\\"Yds !scope=\\"col\\"TD !scope=\\"col\\"Lg !scope=\\"col\\"Yds/Car - !scope=\\"row\\"Damien Williams 17 104 1 38 6.1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Patrick Mahomes 9 29 1 13 3.2 - !scope=\\"row\\"Travis Kelce 1 2 0 2 2 - !scope=\\"row\\"Darwin Thompson 1 0 0 0 0 - !scope=\\"row\\"Mecole Hardman 1  −6 0  −6  −6 - !colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"\\"Chiefs receiving - !scope=\\"col\\" !scope=\\"col\\"Rec !scope=\\"col\\"Yds !scope=\\"col\\"TD !scope=\\"col\\"Lg !scope=\\"col\\"Target - !scope=\\"row\\"Tyreek Hill 9 105 0 44 16 - !scope=\\"row\\"Travis Kelce 6 43 1 11 6 - !scope=\\"row\\"Sammy Watkins 5 98 0 38 6 - !scope=\\"row\\"Damien Williams 4 29 1 13 8 - !scope=\\"row\\"Blake Bell 1 9 0 9 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Mecole Hardman 1 2 0 2 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Darwin Thompson 0 0 0 0 1 } Completions/attempts Carries Long gain Receptions Times targeted ==Starting lineups== 49ers starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo Chiefs starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes {  style=\\"text- align:center; margin: 0 auto;\\" +Starting lineups for Super Bowl LIV - !style=\\"width:160px;\\"  San Francisco !!

The site located in the northwest portion of Makati, on the south bank of the Pasig River, is planned to contain a mixed-use entertainment complex which would include an indoor theater, a shopping mall, hotels and residential and office skyscrapers. It would also contain a football turf, skate park and an outdoor entertainment area. The development is envisioned to become the new entertainment district of Makati and the city's lifestyle hub. ==Location== Ayala Malls Circuit Circuit Makati occupies a large portion of the village of Carmona near its border with Santa Ana, Manila. It is bounded by the Pasig River on the north, Hippodromo Street on the south, Fortuna Street to the east, and Aurelio Reyes Avenue to the west which connects to Chino Roces Avenue. The Santa Ana Church and some of Santa Ana's historic houses are within a few blocks of the site. It is located just north of the Makati CBD accessible via Ayala Avenue and South Avenue, and from Century City and Rockwell Center via J.P. Rizal Avenue and Kalayaan Avenue. ==Background== Circuit Makati had been occupied by the Santa Ana Park, a horse racetrack which operated from 1937 to 2008. Built in the Art Deco style, the racetrack was home to the Santa Ana Turf Club, the forerunner of what is now the Philippine Racing Club which introduced thoroughbred horse racing in the country. Prior to its establishment as a sporting and recreation facility, the site was home to the Santa Ana Cabaret, a dance hall and music venue for Manila's high society in the early 1900s. In 2009, a year after the hippodrome was closed, the Philippine Racing Club opened its new home in the Santa Ana Park (Saddle and Clubs Leisure Park) in Naic, Cavite. The club then entered into a joint venture agreement with Ayala Land and its subsidiary, Alveo Land, in 2011 for the development of the property. ==Planned buildings and facilities== Globe Circuit Event Grounds * Circuit Theater, a 1,500-seat indoor performing arts theater. * Circuit Lane, a retail walk that will cross the entire length of the district. * Circuit Events Ground, a 2-hectare outdoor venue that can accommodate 20,000 people for concerts, dance performances, fashion shows and sporting events. * Ayala Malls Circuit, a lifestyle center by Ayala Malls. * The Stiles Enterprise Plaza, an office-for- sale development by Alveo Land * Solstice, a residential condominium tower by Alveo Land. * Callisto, a residential condominium tower by Alveo Land. * S&R; Circuit, Membership Shopping. ==See also== * San Lazaro Tourism and Business Park ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website of Circuit Makati Category:Makati Category:Mixed-use developments in Metro Manila Category:Planned communities in the Philippines Category:Redeveloped ports and waterfronts in the Philippines Category:Pasig River ","title":"Circuit Makati"},{"id":"46761438","text":"Gregory \\"Greg\\" Booth (born 28 August 1951) is a former Australian rules footballer, who played for the Fitzroy Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Fitzroy Football Club players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:1951 births Category:Living people ","title":"Greg Booth"},{"id":"46761453","text":"Tyler Johnson may refer to: *Tyler Johnson (baseball, born 1981), American baseball pitcher *Tyler Johnson (baseball, born 1995), American baseball pitcher *Tyler Johnson (basketball) (born 1992), American basketball player *Tyler Johnson (ice hockey) (born 1990), American ice hockey player *Tyler Johnson (musician) (active from 2012), American record producer and songwriter *Tyler Johnson (American football) (born 1998), American football wide receiver == See also == * Ty Johnson (disambiguation), various people named Ty or Tyrone Johnson ","title":"Tyler Johnson"},{"id":"46761460","text":"Xaisomboun (/saɪʒəʊmbuːn/ Lao ໄຊສົມບູນ) is a mountainous province in Central Laos, between Vientiane Province and Xiangkhouang Province. The province covers an area of and had a population of 85,168 in 2015. Xaysomboun town in Anouvong District is the economic centre. There are extensive copper and gold mining operations nearby at Sana Somboun. ==History== Xaisomboun is the 18th province of Laos. It was designated special administrative zone between June 1994 and 2006, with the military controlling the area to suppress Hmong resistance and to exploit timber resources. Many Hmong locals fled Laos during this period, taking refuge in Phetchabun, Thailand. Xaisomboun was formally established as a province on 13 December 2013. Since, the development of the hydroelectric power along the Nam Ngum River has led to around 300 families being relocated to Feuang District in Vientiane province. They were not compensated for the loss of their farmland. The province has long been a hotbed for conflict between the government and the Hmong peoples. In November 2015, unrest broke out in the province, killing three soldiers and three civilians. The Laotian government imposed a curfew in the north-central part of the province in early-December, but in January 2016 a bomb was set off at a road construction site near Pha Nok Nok village in Long Cheang District, killing two Chinese officials and injuring another. As a result, on 16 February 2016, Major General Thongloy Silivong, a military officer who is the former chief of the National Defense Academy, was appointed the governor of Xaisomboun to tighten control. On 16 June 2017, another Chinese official was shot dead in the province. ==Geography== Phou Bia mountain from Xaysomboun town The province is mountainous, and to the northeast of the town of Xaysomboun is Phou Bia mountain in Xiangkhouang Province, the highest point in Laos. The principal river, the Nam Ngum, has been subject to a hydroelectric scheme with the creation of a dam and large reservoir and an underground power plant. In March 2014 it was announced that the Chinese company Norinco International Cooperation, Ltd had invested US$218 million in the development, projected to take 42 months. Phou Khao Khouay National Biodiversity Conservation Area is a protected area northeast of Vientiane. It was established on 29 October 1993 covering an area of 2,000 km2 extending into neighboring provinces. It has a large stretch of mountain range with sandstone cliffs, river gorges and three large rivers with tributaries which flow into the Mekong River. ==Administrative divisions== There are 96 villages.

There are copper and gold mining operations nearby at Sana Somboun, with companies such as Phu Bia Mining Limited operating. Phu Kam and Ban Houayxai Gold-Silver are notable mines in the area, with Phu Kham mine producing 83,680 tonnes of copper concentrate and 70,787 oz of gold and Ban Houayxai Gold-Silver produciing 108,570 oz of gold and 666,628 oz of silver in 2018 respectively. The Phu Bia Mining Company began operations in 2006 and as of June 2019 had given nearly 6,248 trillion kip (US$716 million) in cumulative contributions to the government, generating over 3200 jobs for mainly Hmong locals and improving education in the province. Phu Bia has permission to mine until at least 2021. The locals are mainly involved in cultivation, fish-raising, poultry and livestock. Despite local conflict in recent years, the tourism industry is taking off in the province. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Provinces of Laos Category:Mining in Laos ","title":"Xaisomboun Province"},{"id":"46761485","text":"The School and Society: Being Three Lectures (1899) was John Dewey's first published work of length on education. A highly influential publication in its own right, it would also lay the foundation for his later work. In the lectures included in the initial publication, Dewey proposes a psychological, social, and political framework for progressive education. Notably, this includes collaborative practical experimentation as the central element of school work. He argues that the progressive approach is both an inevitable product of the Industrial Revolution and a natural fit with the psychology of children. A final chapter details some of the experiments done at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. Articles in the 1915 edition extended his argument with reprints of Dewey's work published in the Elementary School Record. == Background == Experimentation in education was widespread in the 19th century, and much of late 19th century experimentation involved the introduction of \\"hands on\\" activities into the classroom. Louisa Parsons Stone Hopkins captured the spirit of the time in her speech to the 1890 Boston Mechanic's Fair: > It has been difficult to escape from the traditions of an exclusively book > education. The grammar schools, as their name indicates, have tied the child > to the dead past, and confined him to the medieval form of brain activity > and thought expression, until his connective tissues have ceased to be > sensitive to the environment of nature, and he forgets the material and laws > that touch him on every side : he observes nothing ; he discovers nothing ; > he constructs nothing. There were many experiments with experiential learning at the time Dewey delivered his lectures. Here young children learn how a compass works by making one in a Washington D. C. school in 1899. While the introduction of manual tasks in classroom was underway well before The School and Society's publication, Dewey's work helped to lay a coherent theoretical foundation for progressive experimentation in education. The three lectures that comprise the bulk of the 1899 and 1900 editions were initially given as a fundraising lecture series in support of the Laboratory School. From these lectures, Dewey raised $350 for the school. The lectures proceed in a pattern, the first dealing with the relation of the school to social progress, the second with the relation of the school to the psychology of the child, and the third with the organization of the school as an institution in accomplishing these aims. == Synopsis  The School and Social Progress === The first lecture examines the relationship of education and social progress. Dewey argues that, with the coming of the industrial age, many traditional educative processes had been lost. In a pre-industrial society, children learned beside their parents, pairing learning with application and industry. Dewey explains that such work built character, fostering independence and initiative, but that \\"concentration of industry and division of labor\\" has eroded the possibility of such meaningful, practical learning opportunities in the childhood home. In this environment, a \\"New Education\\" that is \\"part and parcel of the whole social evolution\\" is needed. Fundamentally, education must follow larger shifts in society rather than implement isolated ideas which are \\"arbitrary inventions\\" made by \\"the over-ingenious minds of pedagogues\\" to deal with their specific challenges. Such ideas constitute \\"at the worst transitory fads, and at the best merely improvements in certain details.\\" Where the learning opportunities in the home have disappeared, modern schools must now adapt to fill the gap. The school must become the new \\"child's habitat, where he learns through directed living.\\" Students participate in a botany class in Washington D. C., 1899. By Frances Benjamin Johnston. An important part of such an education is \\"manual training,\\" which includes wood- and metalworking as well as household chores, such as cooking. Dewey tells an extended story of children engaged in sewing at his laboratory school. To do the fiber work they must create raw material from cotton and wool, but in so doing they learn a multitude of lessons in history, geography, engineering, and science. Dewey concludes the story: > I need not speak of the science involved in this — the study of the fibres, > of geographical features, the conditions under which raw materials are > grown, the great centres of manufacture and distribution, the physics > involved in the machinery of production; nor, again, of the historical side > — the influence which these inventions have had upon humanity. You can > concentrate the history of all mankind into the evolution of the flax, > cotton, and wool fibres into clothing. Dewey makes a plea that theory and practice not be separated, arguing that if we truly want to provide for a cultured populace that we must introduce into the educational process those activities \\"which appeal to those whose dominant interest is to do and to make.\\" Since knowledge is moving \\"in all currents of society\\" we have no choice but to find ways to reach all students. === The School and the Life of the Child === In the second lecture, the relation between schooling and the child is examined. Here Dewey proposes a student- centered curriculum. Authentic learning is valued, and must be centered on the natural interests of children: their desire to communicate with others, to build things, to inquire about things, and to express themselves artistically. Dewey begins by talking about the physical bias of the classroom. Student desks are small, crowded together. They have room to hold a book, room for studying, but no room to create. Rather than being a space to work, the classroom is designed as a place to listen and to read. Both are modes of passive absorption. In addition, students are required not only to listen passively, but to listen \\"en masse\\". This \\"passivity of attitude\\" and \\"mechanical massing of children\\" are due to the rigid curriculum and method, which are still rooted in a \\"mediæval conception of learning\\". When the core of a curriculum is listening en masse, then everybody can be tested on the same thing at given intervals. The child in this system is an afterthought; education is structured in a certain way, and the child must bend to it. Dewey proposes a different \\"center of gravity\\" for the instruction: the child him- or herself. This, Dewey claims, is how children are educated in an ideal home setting. Children naturally incline to activity, to conversation, creation, and inquiry. The nature of education must be to take that inclination and direct it toward valuable ends for society. As an example, he describes a cooking class which, through a series of questions by the teacher and students, ultimately leads to lessons in organic chemistry and experiments regarding the effects of heat on the protein in eggs. The impulses of the children are described. They wish to communicate with others. They want to know the nature of things. They enjoy artistic expression and like to make things. After describing a number of other activities from the laboratory school he comes to what he sees as the largest \\"stumbling block\\" that traditionalists have with these approaches: Stimulating inquiry and interest is fine, they say, but \\"how, upon this basis, shall the child get the needed information; how shall he undergo the required discipline?\\" Dewey's short answer to that question is that the \\"needed information\\" and \\"required discipline\\" comes about in such settings—that inquiry for its own sake and the requirements of education are not at odds. Dewey's longer answer (and his conclusion to the lecture) is that we are mistaken to think of the imagination of the child as a separate faculty. Imagination and learning cannot be at odds, because \\"Unless culture be a superficial polish, a veneering of mahogany over common wood, it surely is this -- the growth of the imagination in flexibility, in scope, and in sympathy, till the life which the individual lives is informed with the life of nature and of society.\\" === Waste in Education === In the third lecture, Dewey takes on the issue of \\"waste in education\\" in a somewhat unusual mode. For Dewey, the primary waste in education is a waste of effort on the part of the school and time and effort on the part of the children. This waste, Dewey claims, is a result of isolation: > All waste is due to isolation. Organization is nothing but getting things > into connection with one another, so that they work easily, flexibly, and > fully. Therefore in speaking of this question of waste in education I desire > to call your attention to the isolation of the various parts of the school > system, to the lack of unity in the aims of education, to the lack of > coherence in its studies and methods. Dewey's chart of the development of education in history. From The School and Society, 1900.The first isolation Dewey examines is the lack of connections between the stages of a child's school career. Kindergarten, he argues, comes out of Froebel's synthesis of observation of children's play with the early 19th century idealist symbolism of Schelling. It then becomes difficult to move students from kindergarten into the primary grades, which are organized around the practical concerns of the 16th century: reading and mathematics for commerce. From the primary school to the intermediate school there is another gap, with the intermediate school influenced by the grammar school of the Renaissance, an introduction into culture—at that time Latin and Greek, although in the 19th century other culture as well. Another gap exists between the intermediate school and the high school, which is largely a preparatory academy for entry into universities developed to meet medieval needs around professional study and cultural expansion. Dewey's conceptual design for a unified school. While Dewey is careful to emphasize that these institutions have evolved over time, he notes that the patchwork nature of the sequence remains. The solution, according to Dewey, is to unify the sequence by connecting every part of the sequence to the world outside the school. Dewey argues that the only way to unify the curriculum is to increase its connection to the world outside the classroom. Just as home and industry are not separate from the laboratories and research centers of the world, so the curriculum that finds its inspiration in the outside world can also be unified. To illustrate this he provides a detailed description of a school building designed around the principle of these relationships. On the first floor the four corners represent practice, the machine shop, the textile industries, the dining room, and the kitchen. These are arrayed around the central library, illustrating always that the meaning of these activities are not the activities themselves, but the \\"theory of practical activities\\" which these activities help explicate. These activities are meaningful in the realm of the home and commerce to the individual, but they gain their social meaning from the collective knowledge of the center. The second floor is similar, but more academic in focus. Arrayed around a central museum the art and music studios and the different libraries relate to one another, but also to the practical pursuits of the first floor. The textile needs of the first floor, for example, relate to the biological research of the second. By relating school as a whole to life as a whole the various aims of the phases of education—the utility of the primary school, versus the culture and professional study of the high school—cease to pull in different directions. The growth of the child in \\"social capacity and service, his larger and more vital union with life, becomes the unifying aim\\" and the progression through disciplines merely phases of that growth. == Additional chapters == The 1899 and 1900 editions included a fourth chapter on the activities of the Laboratory School, whereas the 1915 edition contained a number of articles that had been published in the Educational Record around the time of School and Society's release. === Three Years of the University Elementary School === A short report on the expenses and structure of the Laboratory School at the University of Chicago, originally a transcription of a talk given by Dewey at the Parent's Association of the school in February 1899. In it Dewey goes over everything from the expenses of the school to the organization of the grades. Of particular note is Dewey's insistence that the school was not formed to test ready-made ideas, rather > the educational conduct of the school, as well as its administration, the > selection of subject-matter, and the working out of the course of study, as > well as actual instruction of children, have been almost entirely in the > hands of the teachers of the school; and that there has been a gradual > development of the educational principles and methods involved, not a fixed > equipment. The teachers started with question marks, rather than with fixed > rules, and if any answers have been reached, it is the teachers in the > school who have supplied them. He then details some of the questions they set out to address—mainly how the academic and symbolic disciplines should be conveyed to the child and how they can be made relevant to the home and community life of the child. After three years, he claims, the school is still a work in progress, yet \\"some of our original questions have secured affirmative answers.\\" === The Psychology of Elementary Education === Dewey describes the way in which changes in our understanding of psychology should alter educational practice. He outlines some of the changes he has seen in psychology that should impact teaching practice: * Newer psychology sees mental representation as socially constructed. * Newer psychology sees cognition as activity-directed. * Newer psychology sees the child's mind as different from the adult mind. Dewey then details various ways that curriculum has come in line with these newer understandings, and in some cases anticipated them. === Froebel's Educational Principles === Dewey outlines Froebel's educational principles, explaining the places where the Laboratory School is in sympathy with Froebel's approach, but also critiquing Froebel's approach where they differ. Drawing of Teacher Leading Children in \\"Finger Plays\\", one of the methods of imitation and abstraction preferred by Froebel. His first critique is not so much of Froebel, but of those who follow Froebel as a system: > So far as occupations, games, etc., simply perpetuate those of Froebel and > his earlier disciples, it may fairly be said that in many respects the > presumption is against them...that in the worship of the external doings > discussed by Froebel we have ceased to be loyal to his principle. For Dewey, the teacher is a skilled professional who must always look to the particulars of the child and the environment when designing instruction; formulas cannot suffice. His second critique is of Froebel's use of symbolism. This overreliance on symbolism as a guiding principle came about, says Dewey, because Froebel was operating without a scientific psychology, and because the nature of German culture of the time required to keep the culture of the Kindergarten apart from the rigid culture of the surrounding society. For Dewey, this emphasis on symbolism misunderstands the true imagination of the child which suffers from the abstraction and too-quick variety of Froebel's method. A final critique is that of motivation. Dewey argues that while imitation is a powerful tool in education, it cannot be the sole motive of the child's learning. The child, if she is to learn anything, must have and own a conception of the why of the activity as well as the how. He concludes with a plea that the gap between methodologies in kindergarten and primary school be bridged, in the interest of a more productive and pedagogically consistent path for the child. === The Aim of History in Elementary Education === Originally published in Elementary School Record No. 8. Argues that \\"whatever history may be for the scientific historian, for the educator it must be an indirect sociology.\\" By understanding the \\"motors\\" of history the child comes to understand the forces and organizations of her own time. Dewey also details the methods in use in the laboratory school at the time. Key to the method is letting the students \\"live in the times\\", comprehending the challenges the people of that time faced, and endeavoring to discover solutions. As they compare their solutions with the solutions of the past, they understand the past a model for problem-solving in the present. Primary sources are privileged, and textbooks avoided. Above all, history is a tool of \\"social inquiry\\". == Reception == The 1900 edition was warmly received and widely translated and published. The book had almost immediate popularity and influence, with three printings within its first year, comprising 7,500 copies between them.Impressions history from copyright page of late impression of 1900 edition.By the time of the 1915 edition, the Elementary School Record went so far as to say: > It is given only to a few men to write educational classics. Since Spencer > wrote his essays there has not been a more important contribution to > educational reform than Dewey's School and Society. == International influence == The School and Society was republished in Britain almost immediately, in 1900. Global influence followed; the book was read by proponents of progressive education worldwide. The work was cited by Édouard Claparède who helped shape a progressive éducation nouvelle in Geneva, Switzerland, in the years leading up to the first world war. By 1920, Dewey and The School and Society were seen as \\"the authority for child development\\" by Claparède. In Germany, the first chapter, on \\"School and Social Progress\\" was published in a journal in 1903. A German translation of the entire work followed in 1905. However, Dewey's work was distrusted by the elites in the monarchic and authoritarian German Empire, as it \\"built on interaction and cooperation, and therefore on democracy.\\" Some ideas from The School and Society were embraced by monarchist educational reformers but stripped of all underlying democratic ideals because these reformers merely sought to tap into \\"the reserve of talents of the working class in order to serve the monarchy.\\" The work was translated into Russian, and may have influenced Pavel Blonsky and a young Lev Vygotsky. Dewey's ideas outlined in The School and Society appealed to the designers of early Soviet curricula but were generally denounced as incompatible with Soviet ideology, which saw schools as beholden to political goals, by the second half of the 1920s. There is some disagreement on what language the book was first translated into. Thomas Popekewitz states the first translation was into Czech in 1904. Bonoso claims a Spanish version, translated by Domingo Barnés Salinas, appeared in Latin America as early as 1900. Hickman also credits Barnes with the first Spanish translation, but dates it at 1915, and gives Japan the distinction of having the first translation in 1901. All in all, the book was translated into a dozen languages. ==ReferencesExternal links == Category:1899 books Category:Works by John Dewey Category:Books about education ","title":"The School and Society"},{"id":"46761486","text":"Emma Haché is a Canadian writer of Acadian descent.

It is the largest family of Oniscidea, and one of the most species-rich families of the entire Isopoda. Armadillids generally have a strongly convex body shape, with some rather shallowly convex. Like members of the woodlice family Armadillidiidae, armadillids are capable of enrolling into a sphere (conglobation), and are commonly known as pill bugs. Armadillids differ from the Armadillidiidae in that the antennae are fully enclosed within the sphere. Species of Armadillidae occur in a variety of habitats including forests, savannas, and arid regions. Armadillids occur natively in the Afrotropics, Asia, Australia, the Neotropics, and the Mediterranean region of Europe. A few poorly-known species occur in North America north of Mexico, and some are introduced. The family Armadillidae was erected by German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt in 1831, although the earliest named genus now assigned to the family is Armadillo, described by French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril in 1816.

The Old North Church is owned by it builder Sierra Madre Congregational Church, called First Congregational Church of Sierra Madre at the time of completion. It is site #45 on Sierra Madre designated historical landmarks list. There are forty-eight properties listed on Sierra Madre's Designated Historical Properties List. In September of 2018 Sierra Madre Congregational Church changed its name to Christ Church Sierra Madre.Christ Church Sierra Madre, official web site ==History== The Old North Church was constructed by hand with local wood. It is located on the north side of the current Sierra Madre Blvd at Hermosa. In 1890 Sierra Madre Blvd was a dirt street called Central Avenue. Old North Church is currently owned by its builder, Sierra Madre Congregational Church. The Old North Church is closely linked with the early settlement of Sierra Madre. The community of Sierra Madre was established in the fall of 1881. Sierra Madre Congregational Church started as a Sunday School class in February 1882. Without a building of its own, the church originally met in the city's original 1882 one-room schoolhouse at the corner of Hermosa and Live Oak, now called Orange Grove. To use the schoolhouse as a church on Sunday mornings, the pump organ, hymnbooks, and winter firewood were transported to the schoolhouse by the attendees. The following years the Church met in the original City Hall at the corner Baldwin and Central Ave (Sierra Madre), then the original city library (1889), located at the current library site. With the completion of the Old North Church in 1890, the church had its own meeting spot. Congregational Church of Sierra Madre was officially established on March 27, 1886 as a nondenominational church congregational church, with 13 founding members, called First Congregational Church of Sierra Madre then. One of the 13 founding members was Mrs. Annetta M. Carter, wife of the city founder Nathaniel Coburn Carter. From 1908 to 1910 the Old North Church was expanded with the addition of new meeting rooms. The Church's second, and current, main building was built across the street. Construction of the new building started in 1926 with Pritchard Hall and was completed in 1928 with the new sanctuary dedicated on June 17, 1928. The sanctuary cornerstone was laid on Feb. 19, 1928. The 1928 Church building is also a Sierra Madre designated historical landmark, as site #39. Having outgrown the Old North Church in the mid 1920s, the Congregational Church of Sierra Madre built a new stone Church in a Romanesque Revival architecture style, designed by Marsh, Smith, & Powell. Later after the move, the Old North Church was rented to the First Church of the Nazarene in 1939, then purchased by them in 1942. After the Church of the Nazarene outgrew the Old North Church, it was sold back to Sierra Madre Congregational Church in 1976.City of Sierra Madre, General Plan Technical Background Report, September 2012, PDF file, cityofsierramadre.com/documents Congregational Church purchased back the Old North Church for the use of its youth and children, its current role. Sierra Madre's Cub Scouts Pack 373, and some of Boy Scouts Troop 373, meetings are held in the Old North Church. Troop 373 was founded in the Old North Church in 1924. Cub Scouts Pack 373 was started in 1971. Troop 373 was one of the founders of the Sierra Madre Fourth of July parade that then ran from historic Sierra Madre Memorial Park (across the street from the ONC) to historic Sierra Madre Pioneer Cemetery. The Old North Church survived the 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake relatively undamaged. The 1928 building had damage to the bell tower, which was torn down brick by brick and rebuilt. The original ONC bell tower was built with a barn shaped roof, modeled after a Dutch church in Holland. Later the Church of the Nazarene changed the bell tower to have a more classic pointed spire. The bell tower housed the 1893 bell weighing 517 pounds, in 1928 the bell was moved to the new south bell tower.Independent Star-News from Pasadena, California, Page 72, February 15, 1959 In 1890 Old North Church attendees had to walk, ride a horse or ride in a horse buggy. In January 1906 the Pacific Electric street car was installed and rolled in front of the Old North Church, on the Sierra Madre Line, each day from January 1, 1906 till service ended on October 6, 1950. Mrs. Annetta M. Carter (Feb, 10, 1846-Sept. 24, 1937), wife of Nathaniel Coburn Carter (Jan. 24, 1840 - Sept. 2, 1904), was key founder of Sierra Madre Congregational Church.Nathaniel and Annetta married in Feb. of 1864 and had 5 children: Florence, (now Mrs. William H. Mead); Arthur N. (b1868), Julia F., Anita E. (the first child born in the Sierra Madre, (b1883, m1910 to Holt R Gregory) and Phillip C (b1885). Annetta M. Pierce (Carter) and Nathaniel both were natives of Lowell, Massachusetts, Nathaniel came to California for his health in 1871.LA Times, Community Profile: Sierra Madre, January 23, 1996, by CECILIA RASMUSSENAnnual Publication of the Historical Society of Southern California, Volume 6, Page 178, In memory of Nathaniel Coburn Carter In February 1881, Nathaniel Carter purchased the original 1103 acres that comprised the new city of Sierra Madre. The land was acquired in three purchases: 845 acres of Rancho Santa Anita from Lucky Baldwin, 108 acres from the Southern Pacific Railroad Company and 150 acres from John Richardson (1811-Aug. 9, 1884).Sierra Madre Historical Preservation Society, September 2016 Newsletter With no church in the new small town Annetta Carter helped form the worship group in 1882 that became Sierra Madre Congregational Church.Annual Publications of the Historical Society of Southern California, Volume 6, page 178 The ONC bell was made and installed in 1893, and has the quote on it \\"Let him who hears come.\\" made by Meneely Bell Foundry, Troy, NY. The bell was presented to the Church by Mr. A. S. Bixby, from Bixby Knolls, Long Beach. The bell was used for Sunday services and funerals, but also had a civic duty, to alert the all-volunteer Fire Department. The original 1904 Pastor's parsonage house was on the north side of Central Avenue (about 127 W. Sierra Madre Boulevard), but as the city grew the house was now on a busy street, so in 1923 the parsonage was moved to Hermosa, just south of the main SMCC building. Just to the west of the Old North Church are two other historic buildings: a 1919 Old Mortuary (was Ripple Mortuary, now called the New Life Center) and the 1915 Caretaker American Craftsman home (now called the Hospitality House). Both structures were purchased by SMCC in 1986. The 1928 sanctuary has stained glass windows that were given as memorials. The north side of the sanctuary has Apostles windows and on the south side are Prophets windows. The sanctuary east and west walls have two large windows, the east an Angel window with the verse \\"Glory to God in the Highest.\\" and the circular west window is \\"Christ the Teacher,\\" that was given by the Women's Society and dedicated all the children of Sierra Madre. The lower south widows were a gift from Dick and Dotty Anderson in 2008. Memorial chimes were installed in 1944 in to the tower, these played for many years on the hour.Independent Star-News Pasadena, page 8, March 20, 1966 In 1971 Sierra Madre Congregational Church and Bethany Church started the Sierra Madre Christmas Candlelight Walk. The first Candlelight Procession was led by Pastor Bob Vander Zaag of Bethany Church and Rev. Richard Anderson of Sierra Madre Congregational Church.

YZ-8 adopts modular design concept and subsystems such as engine can be changed rapidly among different types, and fuel tanks can be added or reduced based on mission requirement. Externally, YZ-8 looks very similar to another Chinese UAV, the GAIC Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper, because both share similar layout. The most distinct visual difference between ZY=8 and Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper is that the propeller of the former only has two blades while that of the latter has three. There is a bulge on the top of the nose of YZ-8 housing communication satellite dish, which the fuselage of Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper has no such bulge.

It is nearly extinct; in 2005, there were only 1,000 Mezen horses left, and of that number only 64 were breeding. The Mezen horse originated in the northeastern part of the Archangelsk region, between the Mezen and Pineg Rivers. The Mezen was most likely developed by breeding together Estonian, Danish, Holsteins, Mecklenburgers, the Northern forest horse, and Finnish horses, as well as various types of trotters. In the last fifty years, Ardennes horses have begun to be bred into the existing stock. They have long bodies, wide chests, and a narrow, sloping croup. Their hind legs are often cow-hocked. Mezen horses come in bay, black, sorrel, brown, and gray coats. There are two types of Mezen, a lighter type with a dished face and a heavier type. They are noted for their resistance to insects. It is also stated that they can survive on a diet of moss and fish, and that if \\"it gets stuck in snow up to the chest, it can jump out, like a mouse.\\" It is unclear if the origins of the Mezen horse lie in Prince V. V. Golitsyn bringing his stud horse to Archangelsk; in Peter the Great ordering stallions from Obvin to Mezen to improve the local horses; or in Catherine the Great ordering Danish horses be sent to the area. Mezen (mezenskie in Russian) horses are used as work horses in all types of agricultural works as well as in equestrian sport (show jumping (1 m level) and track), in hippo therapy, rescue teams. They are good partners for beginner riders and amateurs as amateur level horses. They are smart, clever and calm to take part in show and festivals successfully. They are also used as carriage horse: in traditional Russian carriage of 3 horses named «troika». High appreciated their ability to move freely through the deep snow (powder snow) and viscous soil. Therefore, it is very promising to use these horses to move the wood-fallen trees from the forest.

He graduated from St. Patrick's Boys' Parochial School, Lowell High School, Northeastern University, and Boston University. He earned his law degree in 1941. \\"Connie\\" as he was known to his friends was the fifth of seven children of William R. Kiernan and Ann Doyle. His Father, Will, was a pharmacist in Lowell with a Drug Store located on the corner of School and Broadway in the Acre. During the depression, it was not unusual for those in need to receive medicine from Kiernan's Drug Store free of charge. Like all of the Kiernan boys, Connie worked in the drug store taking the night shifts to give his father a chance for rest. In 1942, he joined the war effort by volunteering for the Army. When Connie returned from Service he ran for School Committee and began a successful law practice in downtown Lowell. ==Political career== Kiernan served on the Lowell School Committee from 1948 to 1949. He then served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1949 to 1974. From 1958 to 1962 he was the House Majority Leader. He resigned as a Majority Leader to challenge incumbent John F. Thompson for the position of Speaker. During the Speaker's election, Governor-elect Endicott Peabody took the unprecedented step of endorsing Michael Paul Feeney, a fellow liberal Democrat, over Thompson. After Feeney failed to defeat Thompson on the first ballot, most of Feeney's supporters backed Kiernan as a compromise candidate. On the sixth and final ballot he lost to Thompson 118 votes to 78, with 28 votes going to Republican leader Sidney Curtiss and 24 members not voting. Kiernan's support was divided almost equally between anti-Thompson Democrats and Republicans, with 44 Democrats and 34 Republicans voting for him on the final ballot. From 1966 to 1974, Kiernan served as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He was considered an extremely sharp legal mind and often had a line of legislators at his desk asking for help in putting through a proposed Bill. He was known to be bipartisan in his advice and guidance. ==Judicial service== Kiernan was nominated a special justice in the Somerville District Court by Governor Francis W. Sargent, a Republican.

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 8, 2015. ==Plot== Bob buys a model of the helicopter from the movie True Lies and test-flies it in the alley behind the restaurant. Upon landing, however, the helicopter instantly falls apart. Bob calls the person from whom he bought the helicopter, a man named Sheldon Felds. Upon finding that Sheldon doesn’t do refunds for “crash landings,” Bob takes it upon himself to ask for a refund in person. Gene, who had been previously horrified by his own inaction when Tina was about to get hit by a pair of falling shoes, goes with his father to prove to himself he has the ability to take action in bad situations. Bob arrives at Sheldon’s apartment and is again refused to be given a refund. When Bob refuses to leave, Sheldon attacks him with a drone outfitted with a long metal rod for poking. Bob and Gene “regroup” in a dumpster and return to find Sheldon waiting for them with several fish-shaped drones, which shoot B.B. pellets at Bob. Bob, still insistent on fighting Sheldon, goes to local hobby shop The Hobby Hole to buy a new helicopter with which to combat Sheldon’s machines. He meets an employee named Terry, who informs him Sheldon used to work at the Hobby Hole before he was fired for stealing food from out of the fridge in the break room that didn't belong to him and for attacking his co-workers with helicopters – including Terry, who still has a BB pellet lodged in his knee. Terry initially warns Bob not to go up against Sheldon but, realizing he can make a buck off Bob, sells him a $300 “Vanquisher” helicopter. Bob arrives at Sheldon's apartment, climbs onto a roof across the street, and declares an air battle. Sheldon responds by sending out a “Vanquisher-er,” a Vanquisher customized to destroy other Vanquishers. Bob loses his balance on the roof and is trapped hanging off a ledge, from where Sheldon shoots Bob’s posterior full of darts. Terry and two other Hobby Hole employees arrive with their own combat copters and take on Sheldon. The intense air battle rages as Bob hangs off the building in pain. Realizing the futility and ridiculousness of the situation, Gene encourages everyone to “let it the freak go.” The Hobby Hole employees and Sheldon make amends, and Bob and Gene return home. Meanwhile, Tina must do a report on The Call Of The Wild but is struggling to get through the book. Linda admits she never did her assigned readings in school, instead using “pizzazz” to impress her teachers. Linda dresses Tina up like a dog, ties a wheelbarrow to her back in lieu of a sled, and choreographs an elaborate musical number that Tina can neither sing nor remember. When Tina does the presentation, she tears off her dog outfit and wheelbarrow in a fit of frustration. The teacher and class are both impressed, believing she embodied the “savage” themes of the book with her performance. ==Reception== Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying, \\"Lil’ Hard Dad\\" is a fine episode that keeps a particular focus on the Belcher family, with only the helicopter hobbyists and the cameos from Jocelyn and Teddy at the end distracting from the dedicated exploration of the Belchers’ own unique brand of crazy. This isn’t the kind of hugely ambitious episode that redefines what Bob’s Burgers can be, but it doesn’t need to be. This episode succeeds because it identifies unusual ways to combine the five core characters, and those interactions are just unfamiliar enough to add that extra zip to the gags.\\" The episode received a 1.2 rating and was watched by a total of 2.56 million people. This made it the fifth most watched show on Fox that night, behind Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Simpsons, Family Guy and The Last Man on Earth. ==References External links == * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 5) episodes ","title":"L'il Hard Dad"},{"id":"46761786","text":"Sarah Brusco (born October 6, 1978, as Sarah Theresa Pinkerton), is an American Christian musician. Her first album, The Woven Whisper, was released by herself alongside Vineyard Music in 2014. ==Early life== She was born in the State of Ohio on October 6, 1978 as Sarah Theresa Pinkerton, the daughter of Boyd Eugene Pinkerton and Catherine Ann Pinkerton (née, Emery). Brusco became a Christian, when she was 19 years old, while attending Vineyard Church in Columbus, Ohio. She directed small group worship experiences for members of the congregation. ==Music career== Her music recording career commenced in 2014, with the album, The Woven Whisper, and it was released by herself alongside Vineyard Music on August 13, 2014, after a crowdfunding campaign project on Kickstarter. The album's title came from a tapestry she inherited from her grandmother-in-law that was made by her sister, Marie Kelly, and it's now hung in the couples living room. It was meant to convey the \\"idea of God speaking to us in our dreams as well.\\" She claims her recent musical influences to be Julianna Barwick, Jónsi, and Sigur Rós. Brusco spent some time in Northern Ireland, with Christian songwriter, Kathryn Sarah Scott, as her intern learning her craft of songwriting. ==Personal life== She married her husband, Eben, at 24 years old in Ohio on July 11, 2003, while they were members of Vineyard Church. Brusco's first pregnancy resulted in a tumor forming around her ovary causing her vocal chords to harden and leaving her unable to sing. Her medical professionals said she would never regain the capacity to vocally perform as she did before the illness. However, God healed them over time, letting her once again sing. Along with her husband, the couple lived in Chicago, Illinois, for three years, trying to accomplish racial healing through music ministry. They eventually relocated to Augusta, Georgia with their two children where they are currently active in the ministry of their local church. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * The Woven Whisper (August 13, 2014, Vineyard/Sarah Brusco) ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American performers of Christian music Category:Singers from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Singers from Illinois Category:Singers from Ohio Category:Songwriters from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Songwriters from Illinois Category:Songwriters from Ohio Category:American female songwriters Category:21st-century American women singers Category:21st-century American singers ","title":"Sarah Brusco"},{"id":"46761789","text":"Live!

In his private life, he is an oil driller from North Richland Hills, Texas. ==Early life== Holloway was born in Odessa, Texas. As a teenager, he attended L. D. Bell High School in suburban Hurst. Holloway's childhood was not an easy one. According to his CBS Survivor biography, he grew up without a father, and had also been both molested and teased in his youth. ==Survivor== In 2014, Holloway became one of 18 players selected for Survivor: Worlds Apart, the 30th season of Survivor. At the start of the game, Holloway was placed on the \\"Blue Collar” tribe, Escameca. Early on, he formed a close alliance with two tribe members, Kelly Remington and Dan Foley. However, Holloway began to earn the ire of other tribe members Rodney Lavoie, Jr., Lindsey Cascaddan, and Sierra Dawn Thomas when he repeatedly insisted that the tribe do more work around camp. Nevertheless, the tribe did well in challenges and Holloway was soon viewed as the leader, and in the tribe’s only immunity challenge loss, Holloway organized the elimination of Cascaddan. When the tribes were redistributed in the fifth episode, Holloway remained on the Escameca tribe, along with Foley, Lavoie, Thomas, former White Collars Tyler Fredrickson and Joaquin Souberbielle, and former No Collar Joe Anglim. For the final challenge before the merge, Holloway decided to help his tribe throw the challenge to help protect Remington, on the other tribe; Holloway aligned with Anglim, Foley, and Thomas to eliminate Souberbielle, in a blindside which angered Souberbielle's close friend Lavoie and would eventually turn him against Holloway. Once the merge arrived, Holloway came up with the merged tribe’s name, Merica. He then re-added Remington to his Blue Collar alliance, and also brought in former White Collars Fredrickson and Carolyn Rivera, and former No Collar Will Sims II. However, Lavoie had plans to avenge Souberbielle and began forming a sub-alliance with the intent of blindsiding Holloway in the future. Holloway later discovered this plot, and at the subsequent Survivor Auction, he held out from participating in order to have all of his money for a game advantage. Even though he had joined all of the castaways in agreeing to purchase letters from their loved ones, he sneakily reneged; but after earning the ire of his tribe-mates, he relented. Since he had bought his letter after all, he had to compete with Rivera and Foley in a lottery to earn the advantage, which Holloway lost. All this, coupled with his attempted outing of Lavoie for trying to back-stab him, resulted in Holloway's ouster from the majority alliance. He then aligned with former No Collar Jenn Brown and former White Collar Shirin Oskooi. Ultimately, Holloway managed to avoid elimination by winning five of the last six immunity challenges; the one time he lost, he played the Hidden Immunity Idol which he had found, and successfully negated the votes cast against him, eliminating Fredrickson instead. After winning the final immunity challenge on Day 38, Holloway planned to take Rivera and Sims to the end with him, and forced a tied vote between Rivera and Lavoie, thus necessitating a fire-making challenge that Holloway prepared Rivera for earlier that day. His plan was successful, and Lavoie became the eighth and final member of the jury. Months later, on May 20, 2015, it was revealed that the jury of eight ultimately awarded Holloway the win with six votes; Lavoie voted for Sims, Thomas voted for Rivera, and the rest voted for Holloway.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcXUFQ81Hog ===Accomplishments=== With five individual immunity challenge wins, Holloway is tied with Colby Donaldson, Tom Westman, Terry Deitz, Ozzy Lusth, and Brad Culpepper for the most immunity challenge wins in a single season. Also, with four additional reward challenge wins, Holloway is tied with Deitz for the record of the highest number of overall post-merge challenge wins in a single season. Along with Westman, Holloway is one of only two contestants to win five immunity challenges and still win the season. Holloway also set two other Survivor records, by becoming the first person to successfully save himself with a hidden immunity idol and go on to win the season, and the first winner to receive only uncounted votes against him. Host Jeff Probst has since opined that Holloway will \\"go down as one of our top winners.\\" On May 6, while Worlds Apart was still airing, Holloway was listed among the 32 contestants (16 men and 16 women) eligible for the public vote on who would return for the upcoming 31st season, Survivor: Cambodia. As the theme of the new season was players who had only played once and did not win, he became ineligible when he won Worlds Apart. Although Holloway placed in the top 10 on the men's side, he was rendered ineligible after being named Sole Survivor. ==Career== Holloway worked in the oil industry as a driller for ten years prior to his stint on Survivor. After winning the Sole Survivor title, he founded an online T-shirt company called Sweet T's Designs. He started this company with a friend who, along with Holloway, had dreamed of owning a business since college. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official CBS biography page Category:1970s births Category:Living people Category:People from North Richland Hills, Texas Category:People from Odessa, Texas Category:Survivor (American TV series) winners ","title":"Mike Holloway (Survivor contestant)"},{"id":"46761911","text":"The 1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry (1810–12) was a light infantry regiment, founded as a local establishment in British service consisting mostly of Greek and Albanian enlisted men and Greek and British officers that served during the Napoleonic Wars. Later it became a regular British Army regiment as the 1st Greek Light Infantry (\\"The Duke of York's\\") (1812–16). It had no official association with the modern state of Greece or the Filiki Eteria or any Greek War of Independence groups; however, several future leaders of the War of Independence fought in its ranks, as did a number of rank-and-file klephts and armatoloi. ==Background== The British Army during the Napoleonic Wars was small (~40,000 troops) at the outset compared to those of other European countries like France and Prussia. The British Army used foreign volunteers, such as French Royalists, Germans, Greeks and Corsicans to supplement its forces. In 1813 one fifth of the army, 52,000 men, were such volunteers. The British Army in 1813 contained over 250,000 men.Chandler, David; Beckett, Ian; (2003) The Oxford History of the British Army, UK: Oxford University Press, Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the majority of Greek-speaking areas at the time, participated in on-again, off-again alliances with France under Napoleon. Many Greeks fleeing Ottoman persecution or local disputes on the mainland ended up in the Ionian Islands, which were beyond the reach of Ottoman authorities. When Britain became the enemy of the Ottoman Empire, it provided, if not an actual chance to fight for national liberation, at least a possibility of harming a foreign power that was increasingly viewed as hostile to the Modern Greek Enlightenment and under stress due to the rise of nationalism in the empire. When Britain took over the Ionian Islands, it initially relied on small numbers of British and British-foreign troops along with the local volunteer militias, the largest of which was on Zakynthos (Zante), numbering some 2,000 men, with another approximately 2,000 dispersed over the other islands. These were armed at their own expense, and unpaid. They were drawn from the population of the islands and from mainland Greece and Albania, from men with varying levels of experience. A decision was taken to form an elite, paid unit from among the experienced troops, and to give them additional training.Chartrand, René and Patrice Courcelle, Osprey Men-at- Arms 335: Émigré & Foreign Troops in British Service (2) 1803-15 . (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2000). ==Service history== Richard Church as a major in the regimental uniform, 1813 The regiment was raised in the Ionian Islands in March 1810 by then-Captain Richard Church who already had experience managing foreign (i.e. non-British) troops from his previous appointment in the Royal Corsican Rangers. At the outset, its authorized strength was one battalion of 800 men, its actual strength was 548 officers and men when it took part in its first action, the successful capture of Lefkada (then called Santa Maura due to still-lingering Venetian influence) from the French, but suffered high casualties. Later, it was moved to Zante (Zakynthos) which served as its base and reached its full authorized strength. In 1811, Church was promoted Major, and Brigadier General Robert Oswald, late of the 35th Foot as colonel for the Greek Light Infantry Corps, which at that time consisted of only the nominal battalion-sized 1st Regiment.Royal military panorama or Officer's companion, \\"Promotions\\", \\"War Office July, 1811\\", p. 379 Recruitment began for the second regiment, in order to build up to the corps-level strength, after which Oswald was promoted brigadier for the corps. The regiment was put on British establishment in 1812, becoming an official regiment of the British Army, and increased to an authorized strength of 1,129 men of all ranks. It was sent to suppress an insurrection in Montenegro in June of that year, but baulked at being sent to Sicily in 1813. On 22 May 1813 the unit was reviewed and found to be in a \\"very indifferent state, with no field officer present and company officers at a loss to discipline the men\\"; Church was badly wounded in the arm in the attack on Lefkada and did not return to the regiment after recuperating. Instead, he was promoted Lieutenant Colonel went on to become colonel commandant the 2nd Greek Light Infantry, and his second-in-command went with him. At least one replacement major was cashiered for an unspecified offence, and another transferred out. This led to the gazetting of Lt. Col. Henry Cuyler of the 85th Foot as colonel commandant of the regiment on February 2, 1813.Royal military panorama or Officer's companion, \\"Promotions\\", \\"War Office, February 2, 1813\\"p. 75 A 250-man detachment took part in the British expeditions against Republic of Genoa and La Spezia in the spring of 1814. The regiment disbanded in 1816. ==Organisation & administration== Officers were Greek, apart from British regimental staff. The day-to-day language of the regiment was Greek; however, in order to avoid confusion when the regiment or elements of the regiment were brigaded with other British units, English was used for all drill commands. This was generally the practice in all foreign units recruited by the British at the time. Elements of the regiment were often brigaded with other units, for instance, the assaults on Santa Maura, Genoa and La Spezzia also included elements of the Calabrian Free Corps. ==Uniforms and equipment== Depiction of two soldiers of the sister regiment in 1812. The uniforms of the 1st would have been similar, except with yellow instead of green facings, and lower laced shoes instead of boots Theodoros Kolokotronis' regimental helmet (the cross is a later personal addition) The men of the regiment were reported as wearing \\"Albanian dress\\" in 1810; their orders stated \\"clothing and accoutrements were to be made in the Albanian fashion\\". Enlisted men wore red jackets with yellow cuffs, facings, and trim; for the officers, these were gold and white, over a white shirt, foustanella, breeches and stockings. Headwear was usually a red cap (resembling a fez or small beret, like the fario of the Greek Evzones). In some contemporary prints, the officers and men are depicted wearing fillets (kefalodesmoi) instead of caps. Officers wore a crested red dragoon-style helmet, as depicted in the drawing of Richard Church and of later drawings of Greek War of Independence (after 1821) leader Theodoros Kolokotronis who continued to wear the helmet. Footwear consisted of what are described as \\"tied sandals\\" and in illustrations resemble the moccasin-like tsarouhia of the Evzones, only they lack pompoms and have extra lacing to keep them secure. Officers are depicted as wearing taller, higher-heeled three-quarter shoes or short boots. The troops refused to carry British knapsacks, only haversacks. The men were armed initially with sawed-off muskets, but gradually came to prefer British-issue muskets and by 1813 this is what they carried. They wore sword bayonets on waist belts instead of shoulder or cross-belts (this was also common among British light infantry and rifle units). Officers carried longer sabre-style weapons, just as their light infantry counterparts in Western European armies did. The men were supposed to be issued pistols, but it was \\"thought prudent\\" not to issue them to the men as they were, in the view of one historian 'always volatile', although officers carried. At least one contemporary print by Charles Hamilton Smith shows enlisted men of the sister regiment wearing pistols, another two by Goddard depict an enlisted man with a single pistol, possibly French pattern, and the other an officer of the 1st with a brace of pistols and enlisted man with one. Kolokotronis sported a brace of engraved pistols and an ornate cavalry-style cuirass, which are now on display at the National Historical Museum, Athens. Richard Church was depicted wearing a similar helmet-and-cuirass outfit plus metal greaves and knee protectors with gilt lion's heads along with a braided version of the uniform of the unit's sister regiment, in a painting now housed in the Royal Gallery. Both of these romanticized outfits imitating Ancient Greek styles were probably intended for ceremony and were not worn in their entirety in combat, although Kolokotronis did sometimes wear the helmet when he fought, even after the regiment disbanded. As officers, they both would have had the privilege of wearing pistols, and in Kolokotronis' career as a klepht, the carrying of more than one pistol would not have been uncommon. ==See also== * :Category:1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry officers * Greek Legion (Septinsular Republic), a counterpart unit raised by the Russians * Albanian Regiment (France), a counterpart unit raised by the French ==NotesReferences== Category:Military history of Greece Category:Military units and formations established in 1810 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1816 Category:Infantry regiments of the British Army Category:Expatriate units and formations Category:British military units and formations of the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry"},{"id":"46761914","text":"Omer and the Starchild () is a French animated adventure television series created by Frédéric Koskas, Richard Bessis and Bernard Deyriès.

During his sophomore year in Yamagata Central High School, he played as the team's ace pitcher in both spring and summer Koshien tournaments, but his school never made it past the first round. And even though he was often likened to Seibu's Yusei Kikuchi, a highly sought after pitching prodigy out of high school back in 2009, he did not receive any nominations from any of the 12 NPB teams in the 2011 draft. Upon graduating high school, he joined Shin Nittetsu Sumikin Kashima to play for the industrial leagues. He became known for his cutting sliders and fastballs that maxed at 147 km/h, and was compared to Hanshin's Atsushi Nomi – a fellow lefty who also started his career at the industrial leagues under Osaka Gas. He also played for the national team in the 2014 21U Baseball World Cup, where he pitched a total of 10 innings in 3 games, and recorded 20 strikeouts, helping Japan finish second overall. ==Hanshin Tigers== He was the Hanshin Tigers' 1st round pick (3rd choice, after they lost Kohei Arihara and Yasuaki Yamasaki) in the 2014 annual professional draft. In November 26, he signed with the Tigers for a provisional contract of 100 million yen and 50 million signing bonus, for an annual salary of 15 million yen. He was assigned the jersey no. 15.阪神タイガース公式サイト – 2015年新人選手入団発表会を実施 With this, he became just the 2nd Tigers player to hail from Yamagata prefecture (since Shigeichi Aoki in 1978), and the 1st ever pitcher.

In January, he was diagnosed with inflammation in his left sternoclavicular joint, and only resumed pitching in early February. He pitched his first practice game against Orix on March 8, and gave up 2 runs on 3 hits over 2 innings of work, topping out at 148 km/h. On April 18, he started a Western League (minors) game against Hiroshima and tossed seven shutout innings, striking out 6. He started another on May 15 against the same team, where he gave up a run on 4 hits over 5 innings of work. He debuted in his home turf on May 21 against the Giants, and pitched 7 solid innings – topping out at 149 km/h.

Knudsen served as the diocesan bishop of Maine for a decade (1997-2008). Upon retiring from that position, she then served as interim bishop in the Diocese of Kentucky (2011- 2012) and as assistant bishop in the Diocese of New York (2013-2014) and the Diocese of Long Island (2014-2015). In May 2015, she began serving as assistant bishop in the Diocese of Maryland. On December 6, 2018, Knudsen announced her resignation from that temporary position after accepting a position as assisting bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington as of February 20, 2019.https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/chilton-knudsen- appointed-assisting-bishop-washington ==Early life and education== Knudsen is the eldest of four siblings. Growing up in a navy family, she spent a large part of her childhood overseas, including Guam, Japan, and the Philippines. She studied biology and ecology at Chatham College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968. She then attended the University of Pittsburgh for graduate studies and taught at her alma mater. Knudsen then taught in a nursing program at a community college and worked as a counselor at women's health clinics in Pennsylvania and Illinois. ==Ministry== As a young woman, Knudsen felt a calling to the priesthood, but at that time the Episcopal Church was not ordaining women. Following the decision of the church to ordain women, Knudsen attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in Illinois, earning a M. Div. degree in 1980. She was ordained a deacon on June 9, 1980, and ordained to the priesthood on February 24, 1981. She first served in Bolingbrook, Illinois, working to establish a new mission there. She later worked as Pastoral Care Officer/Canon for Pastoral Care in the Diocese of Chicago. Knudsen was elected the 8th Bishop of Maine in 1997 and remained in that post until retiring in September 2008. Presiding bishop Frank T. Griswold, former Maine bishop Frederick Wolf, and bishop Geralyn Wolf of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island were among the bishops consecrating Knudsen as the 938th bishop consecrated in the Episcopal Church. Following her retirement, she served as a missionary in Haiti, as well as interim bishop in Lexington, Kentucky and assistant bishop in the dioceses of New York and Long Island.https://episcopalmaryland.org/about-us/our-bishops/ Following the resignation of Heather Cook as suffragan bishop to the Bishop of Maryland, the diocesan convention authorized diocesan bishop Eugene Sutton and the standing committee to hire an assistant bishop until a suffragan bishop could be nominated and elected. Following the convention, the diocese announced that Knudsen had been hired as assistant bishop.

The story and is inspired from the life of Indian cricketer and former national team captain Mohammad Azharuddin. The film is produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor for Sony Pictures Networks and features Emraan Hashmi in the titular role. The film was released worldwide on 13 May 2016.Its a box office disaster \\"Emraan Hashmi turns Azharuddin on ‘Azhar’ poster\\" The film was a moderate success at the box office as it collected only 568 million gross against the budget of 350 million. The film also drew criticism for its fictionalised interpretation of events. ==Plot== The film begins with Indian cricketer Azhar (Emraan Hashmi) scoring a century in his 99th test match, but he soon faces allegations of match-fixing as his name has been linked with a London based bookie M.K. Sharma aka Shaun (Rajesh Sharma). The Indian cricket board slaps a life-ban on him. Azhar decides to challenge the ban in court with the help of his lawyer friend Reddy (Kunaal Roy Kapoor). The story shifts back to 1963, when Azhar was born to a comfortable middle-class family in Hyderabad. His grandfather (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) dreamt of Azhar playing 100 tests for Team India and motivates a soft-spoken young Azhar to answer his rivals with his batting skills. Young Azhar goes for an Indian team selection match to Mumbai, where on the match day he receives the bad news of his grandfather's death. Nonetheless, he participates in the match, in accordance with his grandfather's last wish. Azhar impresses the selectors, sealing his place in Team India and he soon becomes a national hero by scoring 3 consecutive centuries in his first 3 Test innings. Azhar soon marries Naureen (Prachi Desai) and they both begin a happy married life. After a loss against Pakistan in 1991, the President of Cricket Board calls Azhar for a one-to-one meeting. Azhar initially fears getting dropped from the team, but is surprised when he is offered the position of team Captain. Some senior players like Manoj, Ravi and Navjot, resent Azhar's appointment as Captain, not wishing to take orders from a younger and less experienced player. But Kapil (Varun Badola) supports and encourages him to focus on his duty. While playing in an India–Pakistan match, Javed taunts Azhar, telling Azhar his Muslim heritage would be a better fit for the Pakistan team. Azhar leads his team to victory and soon becomes a successful Captain. At the peak of his career, Azhar's personal life takes a twist when he meets a former Miss India and famous Bollywood actress Sangeeta (Nargis Fakhri) during an advertising film shoot and instantaneously falls in love with her. Sangeeta likes him too but, aware that he is already married, she warns him to stay away from her. Nevertheless, Azhar is infatuated by her beauty and does not listen to her advice. They begin dating but keep their relationship hidden, until it is suddenly exposed by a gossip magazine. Azhar has no alternative but to publicly announce his affair with Sangeeta. Heartbroken, Naureen asks him for a divorce and soon Azhar leaves her to marry Sangeeta. During a cricket match against the West Indies, Azhar gets in a spat with team-mate Manoj for a slow run rate in order to complete his century, letting the team lose. Manoj is dropped from the next match and Azhar leads the team to victory. Manoj is humiliated and vows to take revenge. In later years of his career, Azhar, famous for his expensive lifestyle, comes into the eyes of match-fixers. He is soon approached by a London-based bookie M.K Sharma, disguised as a diamond merchant, who later offers him 10 million rupees to under play in a match against Sri Lanka, which Azhar hesitantly accepts. In a parallel story, after the match-fixing scandal, Azhar is now facing nationwide criticism and a prosecutor, Meera (Lara Dutta), is building up a strong case against him on the basis of sting operations done by Manoj on Ravi, Navjot and several other cricketers. She also uses the report of the inquiry commission set up by the Cricket Board and secretly meets the bookie M. K. Sharma to gather more evidence. Meera also approaches Naureen, asking her to serve as a witness, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Azhar and his lawyer Reddy are struggling to find any proof of innocence as none of his fellow cricketers are ready to help him out. Azhar attends a gym-opening ceremony to gain back his old fame in public, but is left insulted by the owner himself. After a long, eight-year legal fight, Reddy finally makes a breakthrough by proving in court that the inquiry commission report is biased, as they were paid by Cricket Board itself. Reddy even challenges the authenticity of sting operation tapes as none of the witness was under oath and hence can not be treated as truth. Later, Azhar also reveals that he took 10 million rupees from the bookie to keep him away from other team members but later scored a match winning innings and returned all the money to the bookie. On the final day of judgement, both Naureen and Sangeeta attend the court hearing, showing their support for Azhar. Kapil also states in a television interview that he believes Azhar is innocent. In its final verdict, the court lifts the India cricket board ban imposed on Azhar. ==Cast== The movie is based on the real life of Mohammad Azharuddin. * Emraan Hashmi as Azhar Mohammad (Based on Mohammad Azharuddin) * Lara Dutta as Meera Verma, a lawyer * Nargis Fakhri as Sangeeta, the second wife of Azharuddin (Based on Sangeeta Bijlani) * Prachi Desai as Naureen, the first wife of Azharuddin * Kunaal Roy Kapur as Advocate Ramakanth Reddy * Gautam Gulati as Ravi Goyal (Based on Ravi Shastri) * Manjot Singh as Navjot Singh Bachar (Based on Navjot Singh Siddhu) * Karanvir Sharma as Manoj Shinde (Based on Manoj Prabhakar) * Rajesh Sharma as M.

At that time actors Saif Ali Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, and Ranveer Singh were on her wish list. Azharuddin was quizzical over the film until after he had read a copy of the script presented to him by director D'souza. Pakistani actress Urwa Hocane was earlier offered the lead female role of Sangeeta Bijlani, however, she refused saying that she didn't want to do bold scenes.

M A Ganapathy the former Superintendent of Police in CBI who was the chief investigating officer in the match-fixing case has refuted the movie's clean chit to Azharuddin claiming that his confession is on tape with the CBI.

The next year, former employees at Hualon's Toufen factory organized protests, alleging that they were owed $22 million in lost wages and pensions due to Hualon's bankruptcy. In 2014, James and Andrew's acquisition of Paladin was challenged by their nephew, the former CEO of Paladin.

Garden Reach was later taken out. Post-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953.

She is known for addressing Islamic extremism in Indonesia within her comedic routines. ==Early life and education== She was born into a family of Hadrami-Arabic descent in Pekalongan, Central Java. She has described the community in which she was raised as being preoccupied with its Arab identity and with the notion that it has a better sense of what “the truest and purest Islamic teachings” are than other communities in Indonesia. Her parents, she has stated, were “very conservative” in most ways during her childhood, pressuring her “to marry one of her distant cousins,” as her mother had done. She told The Huffington Post, she was raised “with the default expectation that I would grow up into a decent, Muslim girl who will continue preserving her religious and ethnic identity by carefully grooming herself through childhood and adolescence to earn the love of a rich and respected man from the community.” But, she has said, she “grew up resenting marriage and told my mom that I didn’t want to ever get married. I said this all while still in high school.” Despite their conservatism, however, Ma'ruf's parents allowed her to be “exposed to all Western pop culture, from Full House, Roseanne to MTV.” In fact she “taught herself English by watching sitcoms like The Cosby Show, Roseanne, Seinfeld and Full House, all of which featured subtitles in Bahasa Indonesia.” From the time she was in grade school, she has said, she enjoyed “U.S. sitcoms and comedy features.” Around the time she was in middle school, “she discovered that the stars of her favorite shows were actually stand-up comics. Her path became clear.” When, in 2009, she watched a DVD of Robin Williams' Live on Broadway several times, she was set on pursuing comedy. She began doing stand- up, which, she says, “teaches me to be completely honest with myself, my experience and my flaws.” She began with “mild” material “about myself being an old-maid in the eyes of Arab descent community.” In time she began addressing issues within Islam such as violence. Ma'ruf received a bachelor's degree in English from Gadjah Mada University (UGM) in Yogyakarta in 2009. Her dissertation was about stand-up comedy. As of November 2014, she was completing her master's degree at UGM. “I am the only girl from my Islamic elementary school that has been given the chance to earn a Master’s degree,” she said. ==Career== Since around 2009, Ma'ruf has worked full-time as a professional interpreter and translator. In her spare time, she performs comedy. She has appeared on a private television channel, performed at local venues in Jakarta, and taken part in a stage show with fellow comedians. During some of her appearances on TV, producers “have asked her to censor her own jokes, telling her that she is 'too conceptual, theoretical, laden with message.'” But she feel compelled to persevere, living in a society where women are publicly caned for being the victims of gang rape. Hans David Tampubolon wrote in The Jakarta Post in November 2014 that in “the otherwise lame and boring stand-up comedy scene in Indonesia,” Ma'ruf “has started what could be considered a revolution” and has raised “eyebrows with her stage appearances” because she “likes to blatantly address highly controversial issues that are usually avoided by 'popular' comics for the sake of keeping their faces on your television screens.” Tampubolon states that given her “distinctive look and growing popularity,” Ma'ruf “could have easily become a major mainstream comedic star on TV,” but because of constant demands by TV producers that she censor herself, “she opted to perform live instead, delivering her uncensored messages to preserve her art.” She has said that “for her, being a comic is not about fame or money but rather about giving her audience an unforgettable experience and making them think about societal issues and those affecting them personally, even after the curtain goes down.” Among her influences she has cited Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Margaret Cho, Roseanne, Ellen, Kathy Griffin, Robin Williams, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Ricky Gervais, and Jerry Seinfeld. Her favorite comic is Louis C.K. She has been described as having “the cheerfulness of Williams, the bitterness of Louis and...just like Cosby, she never uses swear words or profanity in delivering her messages.” Much of her comedy is about Islamic extremism; she has complained for nearly a decade after the introduction of democracy, “Indonesia has witnessed a significant growth of turban-wearing, beard- growing, loud-screaming Muslims encouraging the Islam that does not tolerate women and minorities to speak up.” She has said that despite her upbringing, she enjoys “American sitcoms more than televised da'wah. I don't speak Arabic like most of my cousins, and I firmly think that ethnic purity that my community claims is nothing but hallucination as we are all actually mixed blood having been living in Indonesia since the Colonial Era. In fact, it may also hurt our religiosity as I believe Allah created us free and equal and will not judge us, except for our obedience and devotion to Him.” Still, she wears a veil because she considers it liberating: it “counters impossible beauty standards. It asserts ownership over her own body. Her use of the veil is also a way she resists the gravitational pull of the fashion industry, allowing her to focus on issues of justice, violence and equality.” ==Honors and awards== Ma'ruf will be awarded the Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent at the Oslo Freedom Forum in May 2015. In 2018, Ma'ruf was recognized with the BBC 100 Women award for her use of comedy to soften Islamic extremism and lessen violence against women. ==References== Category:Indonesian comedians Category:Women comedians Category:Muslim female comedians Category:Indonesian human rights activists Category:BBC 100 Women ","title":"Sakdiyah Ma'ruf"},{"id":"46762167","text":"William Frederick Streeter (born July 14, 1937) is a retired United States Army major general who served as Commanding General, 1st Cavalry Division from 1988 to 1990.

Afterwards, the chef clears the table and cleans the kitchen. Initially supported by a private business angel for a year, the startup then received backing from Bpifrance in 2012. In October 2014, La Belle Assiette raised 1.3 million euros in funding from US and European business angels, bringing the total funding to 1.7 million euros. This allowed La Belle Assiette to open an office in London and pursue European expansion. ==FeaturesSearch=== La Belle Assiette users search for menus prepared by locally available chefs by entering a postcode and the date of the booking. Results can be filtered by price, type of event (romantic, with friends etc.), cuisine (French, Italian etc.), occasion (Easter, Christmas etc.), cooking style (traditional, fusion etc.), dietary restrictions, and seasonality. ===Chef profiles=== Each chef has their own profile page featuring their menus, a brief biography, and customer reviews. Chefs can upload photos of their cooking to their gallery. ===Menus=== Users can browse menus by price, ranging from £39 (Temptation), £59 (Prestige), to £89+ (Signature). Prices are listed per person, with the cost decreasing the more guests there are. ===Concierge=== If a user needs help choosing a chef or has special requirements they can use the concierge service on the platform to deal directly with a La Belle Assiette member of staff. This allows users to organise events such as cooking classes, cocktail parties, buffets, and catering for holiday homes. ===Chef business tools=== La Belle Assiette attracts chefs to register with the service by not only offering promotion among users, but also by offering tools and advice for private chefs regarding billing and business practices. ==International expansion== La Belle Assiette is present in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with plans to expand further in Europe during 2015. ==Business model== La Belle Assiette receives 12% of the total cost of a booking, with the rest going to the chef to cover supplies and labour. ==Reception== 2012 - Won the Best E-commerce Innovation award from FEVAD and Journal du Net. 2013 - Awarded first place at the Grand Prix \\"Push Forward\\" Pitch Contest 2013, organised by FullSix Group and L'Express Ventures. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Labelleassiette.co.uk *labelleassiette.fr *La Belle Assiette UK official Facebook page *La Belle Assiette France official Facebook page *La Belle Assiette UK official Twitter page *La Belle Assiette France official Twitter page *La Belle Assiette official YouTube account Category:Online marketplaces of France Category:Chefs of French cuisine Category:Websites about food and drink ","title":"La Belle Assiette"},{"id":"46762357","text":"A Woman and Two Men in an Arbour (1657) is an oil on panel painting by the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch; it is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. == Description == This painting by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote; \\"306. Man and Woman in an Arbour. To the right are a man and a woman in an arbour. He is seated, quietly smoking a pipe, which he holds in his right hand ; he wears red breeches, white gaiters, and light brown shoes. Before him, to the left, stands the woman, in a red jacket trimmed with fur; she has a glass in her left hand and a jug in her right, and seems to be about to drink his health. The house is not represented, and there is no vista. Dr. Bredius considers the picture genuine. Formerly in the Sellar collection, London. Sale. D.

Perhaps the face was too dark to see, and that is why he assigned the number \\"306a\\" to the sales catalog entry, in case it was a separate picture. == Provenance == According to the MET's museum website, the provenance of the painting is as follows: * David P.

It is located 40 kilometres (25 mi) northeast of Vientiane. It was established on 29 October 1993 covering an area of 2,000 km2 extending into Xaisomboun Province, Vientiane Prefecture, Vientiane Province, and Bolikhamsai Province. It includes a large stretch of mountain range with sandstone cliffs, river gorges and three large rivers with tributaries which flow into the Mekong River. It has mountainous topography with elevation varying from 200 m – 1761 m. The area emerged from \\"uplifting and exposure of the underlying sedimentary (Indosinias schist-clay-sandstone) complex\\". Sandstones are also seen spread in layers. Extensive flat uplands with sandstones with hardly any soil cover are also part of the topography of the park. The park has monsoonal climate with recorded annual rainfall of 1,936.1 mm (with higher reaches recording more rainfall). The mean annual temperature is 26.6 °C with recorded the mean maximum of 31.6 °C and the mean minimum temperature of 21.5 °C. The forests are evergreen, Shorea mixed deciduous forest, dry dipterocarp and pine type; particularly coniferous forest, of mono specific stands of Pinus merkusii, Fokienia hodgsinsii, bamboo (mai sanod), and fire-climax grasslands. Animals found in the park include elephants, tigers, bears, 13 pairs of white-cheeked gibbons, langurs, reptiles, amphibians and birds. Sightings of the green peafowl have been reported near Ban Nakhay and Ban Nakhan Thoung, although it was generally once considered extinct in Laos.

During the Second World War he spent time in various prisons until the Italian capitulation in 1943, after which he joined the Slovene Partisans' Overseas Brigade. After the war, he lived a Bohemian lifestyle in Ljubljana. Initially he painted in the Impressionist style, following the lead of Rihard Jakopič. His education in Italy and travel increased his enthusiasm for Futurism and Expressionism, and he was also attracted by bold Constructivism. He later introduced elements of Cubism into his painting. After 1931 he mostly produced drawings in red chalk and red pencil; he addressed social themes and developed his own style. He was also engaged in scenography and caricatures, and created newspaper illustrations. His most characteristic motifs included manual laborers, miners, Ivan Cankar's character the farmhand Jernej, Maxim Gorky, and Vladimir Lenin. His most significant works include his Futurist paintings Avtoportret (Self Portrait, 1926), Portret arhitekta (Portrait of an Architect, 1926), Ljudje na sprehodu (People on a Walk, 1931), and V jetnišnici (In Prison, 1931).

First, unsuccessful attempts to combine the two had already been made three years earlier but were voted down by the members of VTV. It took until 1985 to see the new club having some success when it won promotion to the Bezirksliga. From there the club rose to the Bezirksoberliga Lüneburg, now the Landesliga, in 1987. After an era of success the club declined again in the late 1990s, suffering relegation down to the Bezirksliga in 1997. In 2001 the club returned to what was now the Landesliga Lüneburg.Geschichte SV Drochtersen/Assel website — Club history, accessed: 21 May 2015 A runners-up finish in the Landesliga in 2004–05 took SV Drochtersen/Assel up to the tier five Verbandsliga Niedersachsen-Ost where it played as a lower table side for the next three seasons. In 2008, with the disbanding of the Oberliga Nord, the league was renamed to Oberliga Niedersachsen-Ost. Drochtersen/Assel achieved two upper table finishes in the league in the next two seasons. A seventh place in 2009–10 qualified the club for the now single division Oberliga but a 17th place in 2010–11 meant it had to drop down to the Landesliga again. Winning a championship in the Landesliga Lüneburg in 2011–12 took the club back up to the Niedersachsenliga. After three seasons at this level the club won the league in 2014–15 and earned promotion to the Regionalliga Nord. After winning the Lower Saxony Cup in 2018, SV Drochtersen/Assel qualified for the DFB-Pokal. In the first round, they were drawn at home against Bayern Munich – winner of the previous six Bundesliga titles – and lost by a sole goal from Robert Lewandowski in the last ten minutes. In 2019, they won the Lower Saxony Cup again, qualifying for their third participation in the DFB-Pokal in four years.

It is essentially the removal of water, sediment and microbial contamination from such fuels as diesel, red diesel and biodiesel. This fuel contamination, also known as 'fuel bugs', or 'diesel bugs', or 'so-called algae' build up over time in stored fuels if they aren't tested and treated on a regular basis. Fuel Analysis should be undertaken before fuel polishing is commenced so that the exact contamination problem can be rectified with a targeted solution. A second fuel test should be performed after the fuel polishing has been completed to confirm the problem has been fixed. ==Sources of contamination== * Water ** Dissolved Water ** Emulsified Water ** Free Water * Microbial Growth (AKA Diesel Bug) ** Bacteria ** Yeast ** Mold ** Bio-films * Solid Particle Contamination ** Rust ** Dirt ** Gums ** Wax ** Soot ** Organic Compounds Any and all of these contaminants will eventually lead to break downs or engine failure. These types of contamination can be introduced from many different sources throughout the supply chain of the diesel fuel as well as within the storage tank itself. Any one of these contaminants can cause complete engine failure. In April 2010, Cathay Pacific Flight 780, an aircraft carrying over 300 passengers, had a close call when fuel contaminated with spherical particles damaged the aircraft's engines, resulting in 57 passenger injuries as the pilots had to land the aircraft at twice the normal landing speed.Cathay Pacific Flight 780 == Symptoms of 'diesel bugs' == The symptoms of diesel bugs are easy to find. Important things to check over and look out for are: * Blocked Filters * Fuel System Failure * Worn Fuel Injectors * Corroded Tanks * Engine Failure Microbial contamination is significantly accelerated when higher biodiesel content occurs along with lower sulphur content. ==Water in oil== Almost everything on Earth contains elements of water; oil and fuel are no exceptions. While very small amounts exist in fuels to start with, stored fuel will become a breeding ground for the microbial bacteria and over time, the levels of damage change from dissolved to emulsified and finally free. * Dissolved - Dissolved water in oil is the presence of water but, unnoticeable to the eye. The water continues to develop until saturation point where water visibility begins. * Emulsified - At the point of saturation, a cloudy appearance will be the tell-tale sign that the water/oil mixture has become emulsified. * Free - The most developed stage of fuel contamination is when free-flowing puddles of water appear within stored oil. At this point, bacterial contamination and growth is boosted. == Microbial contamination == The contaminants found in fuel can be made up of a number of things, predominantly Hormoconis Resinae, which is typically the main contaminant when microbial contamination is present, along with bacteria Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and fungi such as yeasts and moulds like Yarrowia tropicalis. Diesel bug (microbial infections) can and often has the appearance of sludge. To the layman this could simply be dirt and sand, but is in fact a living organism. This sample was incubated over three months in a 1-litre jar of clean diesel. ==Fuel polishing process== In essence \\"polishing\\" is an advanced level filtration of the fuel, monitored and controlled via a central processing unit. Its application ensures the need for fuel additives is either massively reduced or totally removed. A typical process involves a single pass of the fuel through different apparatus, removing increasingly finer contaminant in each stage. The application of different filter technologies is vital; a single process is not sufficient to extract the different forms of water and matter found in fuel. File:W-PFS-010-W-220vac 2014 small.pngTypical advanced fuel polishing system (W-PFS) File:50 litre per minute Fuel Polishing System at a UK NHS Hospital.jpgThis 50 litre per minute fuel polishing system is fitted to a 10,000 litre holding tank of diesel fuel at a UK Hospital. File:600 litre per minute Fuel Polishing Station.jpg600 litre per minute Fuel Polishing System During the fuel polishing process, multiple stages are required to effectively remove the solid particulates, wet foreign matter and water from the fuel. This multi-stage process ensures the high efficiency of the process; however, ensuring dense matter removal first is key, as is the removal of large matter on the suction side of the internal pumping stage. High pressurization of fuel contamination is notoriously dangerous and as such the majority of the polishing process should be carried out on the suction side. The pressure side process is often referred to as the final or finishing stage, where 2 micron particulate is removed and the fuel's final water content is extracted to within the efficiency of the filter stages. The amount of time required to complete the fuel polishing process depends on several factors. One of the most important is the specific fuel polishing machine used. Fuel cleaning machines can polish at rates from 8 litres per minute to upwards of 400 litres per minute, however the factors which govern the process are about more than just flow rate. In fact a high flow rate can be detrimental to the overall effect due to increased pressures in the filter stages and adverse disturbance in the fuel tank. Another factor can be the quality of the fuel. If the fuel is highly contaminated it will typically take longer to clean than a batch of cleaner fuel of the same volume. The third factor to take into account is the volume of fuel to be processed.

In order to achieve this effect, the brim may be rolled, stiffened or padded. A bumper brim can be added to a variety of hat designs, from small to large. ==History of the design== Ascot Races, Brisbane in 1939 The bumper brim was popular during the 1930s, when it was added to small hats, usually these were tilted well forward on the face. It could be incorporated into hats made of a variety of materials; a 1937 article in The Times describes a new trend in London for small summertime bumper brim hats, designed for street rather than beach wear, made of straw, grosgrain or felt. In the same year, a Virginia Gardner article in the Chicago Tribune reported on key trends from Chicago designers and highlighted the bumper brim as the major innovation of the season. \\"'The new muffin hat', a buyer explained. 'It is exceeded in importance only by the new bumper brim'.\\" Bumper-brimmed designs also featured in the 1940s, when they were often worn well back on the head – often in the style of a halo hat – in order to frame the face. Millinery editor of Women's Wear Daily Maud G. Moody attended a 1946 fashion show in New York held by representatives of the French millinery industry – including Elsa Schiaparelli and Rose Descat – and described the most notable designs as including beret-type hats with bumper brims. She also highlighted a wide-brimmed padre hat, combining red crown with navy-blue bumper brim. In the 1950s, hats with bumper brims were often worn square on, creating a wider profile. ===Notable bumper brim hats=== Beatrix of the Netherlands wore a blue bumper brim design in 2013 during a visit to Amsterdam by President Putin Hillary Clinton wore a blue velour rolled-brim hat at Bill Clinton's 1993 Presidential Inauguration. The design, which was by Connecticut milliner Darcy Creech, attracted criticism. An article in The New York Times reported it was considered unflattering by fashion critics and some commentators considered it inappropriate to wear a hat once her jacket had been removed. An article originally published in The Times ahead of the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama provided a run-through of previous fashion hits and misses among first ladies and noted that Hillary Clinton's headgear had become known as the \\"Oh-God-What-is-That? Hat\\". Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands favours a bumper-brim style, wearing a blue version during a 2013 visit to Amsterdam with President Putin.

It was first described by the botanist John William Moore in 1933 from Raiatea in the Society Islands, where it was found growing on trees, having escaped from cultivation. ==History== Vanilla tahitensis is a polyploid species and has been shown to be a cross between Vanilla planifolia and Vanilla odorata. This hybridisation may have happened naturally or inadvertently in the period 1350-1500 in tropical America. It was used by the Aztecs and the flavour proved popular with the Spaniards. Hernán Cortés brought vanilla pods to Europe where they were grown in greenhouses, and cultivation was attempted in various tropical locations. Seed from Madagascar were taken to Tahiti in 1848 by the French Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, and it was this foundation stock that is now cultivated as Vanilla tahitensis in French Polynesia. In Mexico, it is pollinated by a specific species of bee, so when grown elsewhere, the flowers need to be pollinated by hand in order for the pods to develop. ==Description== Vanilla tahitensis in cultivation Vanilla tahitensis is a vine that grows on trees for support. It has zig-zag stems, narrow elliptic leaves and yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by bunches of bean-like pods. As compared to the more widely grown Vanilla planifolia, the pods are shorter and broader, and its taste and fragrance are also distinctive. ==Cultivation== Vanilla tahitensis bean (down) The seed is planted at the foot of a small tree and the vine scrambles up the trunk. When it gets too tall to be easily reached, it is detached from the trunk and wound round it, the trunk becoming surrounded by multiple layers of vine. The plant starts flowering when three years old, and as the flowers only last for a day, hand-pollinating them needs to be done in a timely manner. The pods develop over a period of about nine months, and when they turn reddish-brown, they are picked by hand. They are then sun-dried by day and placed in sweatboxes by night. The curing and fermentation process lasts for about three months, during which time the pods lose much of their moisture and become supple and oily. ==Chemistry== The pods are relatively flavourless when first picked and the typical flavours and aromas arise during the curing process. The main active ingredients are vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and vanillic acid. ==See also== Vanilla production in French Polynesia ==References== tahitensis Category:Plants described in 1933 ","title":"Vanilla tahitensis"},{"id":"46762989","text":"David E.

He is the first Korean-American to hold a council seat in Los Angeles, California, and the first Asian-American to serve on Los Angeles City Council Leadership.Larchmont Buzz: \\"Councilmember David Ryu Named Assistant Council President Pro Tempore\\", 01/15/2020. ==Early life== Ryu was born Ryu Eun-seok in Seoul, South Korea, in 1975, the oldest of three children.Los Feliz Ledger: \\"Council member's father dies of heart attack\\", 10/17/2016. His father, Eul Chul Ryu, and mother, Michelle Won Chung Ryu, moved the family to Los Angeles, California in 1980, when Ryu was 5 years old. There, Ryu's father served as editor in chief of the Korean Street Journal newspaper based in Los Angeles, and his mother worked as a nurse. Ryu's parents were married for over 40 years before his father's death in 2016. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from UCLA and a Masters of Public Policy & Administration from Rutgers University. === 2002 arrest === In August 2002, Ryu faced a charge of attempted rape, to which he plead not guilty. The case was dismissed before reaching a preliminary hearing when the district attorney's office said it was unable to proceed within the statutory period. There is no publicly available court file that states the reasons for why the prosecutors felt they could not move forward with the case. == Professional life == After graduating from UCLA, Ryu became a Deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Burke. He later worked as a special investigator for Los Angeles County's Auditor-Controller. Ryu later served as Director of Development and Public Affairs for Kedren Acute Psychiatric Hospital and Community Health Center. ==Political career== Ryu was one of over a dozen candidates to replace Councilmember Tom LaBonge, who was term-limited. Ryu and Carolyn Ramsay, a former aide to LaBonge, advanced past Joan Pelico, Teddy Davis, Step Jones, Rostom \\"Ross\\" Sarkissian, Mike Schaefer, Wally Knox, Tomas O'Grady, Jay Beeber, Tara Bannister, Sheila Irani, Fred Mariscal, and Steve Veres, in the March 2015 primary. Ryu defeated Ramsay in the general election, on May 19, 2015. He was ceremonially sworn in June 29, 2015, and took office on July 1. Ryu chairs the Health, Education and Neighborhood Councils, Parks, Arts, Entertainment and River Committee, and serves as a member on the Public Safety Committee, the Public Works & Gang Reduction Committee, and Immigrant Affairs, Civil Rights and Equity Committee, as well as Vice Chair of the Arts, Entertainment Parks & River Committee. ===Political positions=== Document retention Document retention was the first part of Ryu's agenda to be acted upon. One of Ryu's first legislative actions in City Council was introducing a motion to require outgoing City Council members to retain documents when an office transitions. The motion passed in September 2016. Before this motion, there was no rule barring outgoing City Councilmembers from destroying documents before leaving office.Daily News: \\"LA City Council tightens record-keeping rules after fallout over destroyed documents\\", 09/07/17 Campaign finance Also soon after entering office, Ryu pushed for a ban on political donations from non-individuals, including corporations, developers, unions, and business groups. No other member of City Council would second the motion, and it did not proceed. In January 2017, Ryu, along with Councilmembers Joe Buscaino and Paul Krekorian, introduced a motion to ban contributions to city elected officials and candidates for city office from developers and their principals with development projects currently or recently before the city, as well as increase matching funds to 6:1 in primary and general elections. In December 2019, the law passed with a unanimous vote from the City Council. The Los Angeles Times reported that the measure bars real estate developers from contributing to the campaign of city officials and council candidates while they have building projects being considered for approval by the city. Critics of the measure argued that the final language contained loopholes, with groups such as the California Clean Money Campaign and California Common Cause arguing that passing it would be “worse than not passing anything at all.\\" The law does not prohibit developers from raising money from other donors and directing those funds to politicians, nor does it penalize politicians for knowingly accepting banned donations. The ban also does not apply to subcontractors on a development project. Real estate developer Tom Gilmore was quoted as saying that \\"I don’t think it’s meaningful to block developers from giving $800 checks [to candidates] while still allowing them to raise $20,000.\\" Speaking about the measure, Ryu was quoted as saying, \\"Do I think this is going to solve all corruption? Of course not. But this is something that has been needed in the city of Los Angeles for decades.\\" Neighborhood preservation Preserving residential neighborhoods was another part of the agenda of Ryu. Out-of-scale homes, also known as \\"McMansions,\\" were a concern to many residents, particularly in Beverly Grove, Hancock La Brea, and the San Fernando Valley. In December 2016, Councilmember David Ryu introduced a \\"Baseline Mansionization Ordinance\\" to address this citywide issue\\"STATEMENT: Ryu on Ordinances for Baseline Mansionization and Baseline Hillsides,\\" 12/09/16. This motion intended to limit the scale of the construction and revise the city's rules which govern the amount of residential floor area that can be developed on a single-family lot through the approval of the Baseline Mansionization Ordinance (BMO) and Baseline Hillside Ordinance (BHO). The ordinances were passed and went into effect in March 2017. Councilmember Ryu expanded the Historic Preservation Overlay Zone to include the Miracle Mile neighborhood on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. This zone preserves the unique and historic character of a neighborhood while still allowing for new housing opportunities.\\"Miracle Mile HPOZ Approved by Council Committee, 03/21/17\\" Spending transparency Ryu became the first city councilmember in Los Angeles to appoint a panel of citizens to oversee and advise how he uses his discretionary funds, dubbed \\"The Discretionary Funds Task Force\\". In Los Angeles, each one of the 15 members of City Council are apportioned \\"discretionary funds\\" from the city's budget to be used on projects in their district. However, disclosure of how this money is used is not required, and there is little oversight. To address this, Ryu introduced his Discretionary Funds Task Force, which doesn't have the authority to tell the Councilmember how to spend his discretionary funding, but can make recommendations and advise the Councilmember on how to use this funding. Councilmember Ryu also became the first and only councilmember in Los Angeles to make his discretionary spending history publicly available on his website. ===Controversies=== In November 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that despite a campaign pledge not to take money from real estate developers, Ryu's campaign had accepted campaign contributions from multiple developers, including \\"from companies linked to Dae Yong Lee, who until recently was seeking to overhaul a Little Tokyo mall; a real estate investment company called First Serrano Apartment LLC; and the head of a Beverly Hills company specializing in commercial property.\\" His campaign later said that it would return some of the donations. In August 2020, the Los Feliz Ledger filed an ethics complaint with the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission after Ryu's campaign sent an email to 30,000 voters with a misleading \\"From:\\" field that implied the email was sent by the Ledger itself. The campaign declined to issue a correction. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official Councilmember David Ryu—Los Angeles City Council District 4 website *Campaign website Category:Los Angeles City Council members Category:California Democrats Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Korean descent Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American politicians of Korean descent Category:Rutgers University alumni Category:Rutgers University people Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni ","title":"David Ryu"},{"id":"46762998","text":"Zukisa Laurah Lumka Tshiqi (born 11 January 1961) is a judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and formerly served on the country's Supreme Court of Appeal and as an acting judge on the Constitutional Court.\\"Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeal\\", SCA website. ==Early life== Tshiqi was born in Qingana, Eastern Cape in 1961.

Opened in 1874, it was situated in a railway cutting at the base of Mont de la Ville below Fort Regent. The station was referred to as St. Helier (Snow Hill) to distinguish it from another railway terminus opened by the Jersey Railway in 1873 at the Weighbridge (now Liberation Square) in St Helier. The station was in passenger operation until the line closed in 1929. Today the site is occupied by the Snow Hill car park. ==History== The Jersey Eastern Railway Company was constructed in response to demand by the inhabitants of the harbour town of Gorey following the opening of the Jersey Railway line in the west of the island. The States of Jersey passed an Act authorising the construction of an eastern railway lone from Snow Hill to Gorey, and on to St Catherine on 31 March 1871 and Royal Assent was received in 1872. On 6 April 1873 the Jersey Eastern Railway Company was registered. It had permission to construct a railway from Snow Hill to Gorey, and on to St Catherines. The line took several years to build and the final section to St Catherines was never completed, with the terminus at Gorey Pier opening in 1891. The site for the JER's Saint Helier terminus was difficult as there was no route around Mont de la Ville into the town centre. It was decided to excavate a -long, -deep cutting through the rocky outcrop under Fort Regent and Regent Road to provide a terminal station on Hill Street. The excavation works overran and when the Eastern line opened in August 1873, it ran only as far as a temporary terminus adjacent to the JER's locomotive depot at Green Street. Snow Hill station eventually opened on 6 May 1874. The station approach was a short cobbled crescent running from Hill Street leading to a station building at the north end of the station, which contained the booking office, waiting rooms and station offices. There was one -long platform which could accommodate one long or two short trains, a carriage siding and a turnaround loop. The station was covered by a canopy. The line out of the station was single-track, with a short section of double track passing under East Road bridge to the Green Street level crossing. Initially, the line was a success, with 28 trains running between Snow Hill and Gorey each day. In 1881, a steam ferry service commenced operation from Gorey to Carteret in Normandy, France, and the JER offered through tickets from Saint Helier to Paris Saint-Lazare via the newly opened Carteret to Carentan Railway. ==Closure== After years of successful operation, the JER ran into financial difficulties after World War I, and fierce competition from us services run by the Jersey Bus Company drove the company's profits down. In 1929, after a failed merger proposal with the Jersey Railway, the JER went into liquidation and the railway line was closed. Snow Hill station was demolished and the land below Fort Regent was converted into a bus station by the States of Jersey in 1932. The site was particularly narrow and the bus station was equipped with the unusual feature of a bus turntable to allow buses to turn around more easily. The bus station closed in 1964 when a new bus station opened at Weighbridge, adjacent to St Helier's other disused railway station. Since then, the site of Snow Hill station has been in use as a car park. ==Cable car== In the 1970s, Fort Regent was developed as a tourist attraction. An aerial cable car was opened in April 1970 to transport visitors to the summit. The ground-level station was built on the former Snow Hill station site, at the north end of the car park. The cable car continued in operation until it closed in the late 1980s and the Snow Hill station was demolished. The high-level cable car station was finally demolished in 2018. Today the site is occupied by a car park; all that remains of the railway station is a stone wall facing hill street. A blue plaque has been fixed to this wall commemorating the station. The Jersey Eastern Railway Terminus Hotel, known as The Eastern Hotel, is still standing on the corner of Hill Street and Snow Hill and is now a listed building. ==References== * * Category:Transport in Jersey Category:History of Jersey Category:Railway stations opened in 1870 Category:Railway stations closed in 1929 Category:Disused railway stations in the Channel Islands Category:Buildings and structures in Saint Helier ","title":"St Helier railway station (Jersey Eastern Railway)"},{"id":"46763167","text":"Map of the results of the election.

His mother remarried when his father died when he was 10 years old. Sava Sekulić was raised by his uncle and his aunt. He never attended any schools. His father taught him to read and write. Also, Sava used to quote his father's last words: Learn by yourself, draw and write with a stone in your hand. During World War I, he was harmed and lost one eye when he was 15 years old. He started writing poems when he was 22 and painting in 1932, but he did not dedicate himself to painture exclusively. In 1943, during the World War II he began to work as a builder. Parallel to writing poems, after his retirement in 1962, Sava began to do painting in order to define his poetry more precisely. Sekulić belongs to the group of the so-called outsider artists, lonely, bizarre, asocial people who create new forms of beauty. His unusual associativity and ability for materialization of his intellectual energy as a complete self-taught was intuitively and instinctively released. He died in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1989.М. Бошковић; М.Маширевић, Самоуки ликовни уметници у Србији, Торино, 1977; 74, 78Н. Крстић, Наивна уметност Србије, SANU, MNMA, Jagodina, 2003; p. 100 == Artistic style == Sekulić is a painter of the universal, the timeless and the limitless. For him everything is generalized, from the individual he aspires to the universal, and is very successful. Therefore, his works are the highest achievements of L'art brut, not only in the country, but worldwide. Allegories and metaphors are present in nearly all his works. With his visions he reduced a unique pictorial definition, minimized the subject matter to a metaphor. Most numerous are his compositions with human figures, portraits and scenes with historical and beings. While painting historical personalities, he portrayed the victims as heroes, and the members of his family as mythological beings. However, the most complex is the figure of a woman. In many works there are philosophical stories and moralizing lessons. Figures are simplified, flat and highly stylised. In the background of every painting is an original story derived from numerous popular legends and beliefs – pagan, Christian, mythological, historical or contemporary. The myths with the pronounced respect for animals – primordial parents and beliefs on summing up people and animals are presented in his paintings by duplication and compaction of human and animal figure (fish, bird, horse, cow, snake, octopus, deer, bull, he-goat...), multiplication of heads and limbs. The artist prefigured the symbiosis of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, where all the alchemy of his pictorial expression is clearly visible. It is paradoxical that the artist’s very style counteracts the narrative aspect of the painting and concentrates totally on the pictorial value with the strength on an unconscious neo-primitive. His palette is restricted. He often paints surfaces with different applications of transparent colours, one over the other, without waiting for the earlier layer to dry, which leads to mixing and assimilation of colours. One colour is often predominant in each painting, which sometimes creates a monochrome impression. He sometimes only partly paints the background of certain paintings, thus leaving whole surfaces unpainted. This additionally eliminated any illusion of spatial depth. Sekulić’s paintings are pervaded with a number of inventive characteristics, the symbiosis of the real and the surreal, with the character of almost pure automatism. The superiority of the artist’s senses overgrows the perception of a beholder. An ordinary observer is not capable of noticing and understanding sensitive structure of purely pictorial phenomena; his paintings are firstly accepted as a kind of visual intrigue and are later intellectually experienced. Finally, Sava Sekulić is one of the greatest Serbian outsider and naïve painters and a world classic also.N.

The club's now defunct women's team twice took part in the DFB-Pokal, in 2002–03 and 2003–04, reaching the second round once. ==Honours== The club's honours: * Schleswig-Holstein-Liga ** Champions: 2015 * Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein-Nord-Ost ** Champions: 2013 ** Runners-up: 2012 ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club:Historic German football league tables Das Deutsche Fussball Archiv, accessed: 22 May 2015TSV Schilksee at Fussball.de accessed: 22 May 2015 {  - align=\\"center\\" dfdfdf\\"  Season  Division  Tier  Position - align=\\"center\\"  2003–04  align=\\"left\\" Bezirksliga 4  VI  ffcccc\\" 15th ↓ - align=\\"center\\"  2004–05  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Kiel  rowspan=2 VII  13th - align=\\"center\\"  2005–06  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Kiel  ffcccc\\" 15th ↓ - align=\\"center\\"  2006–07  align=\\"left\\" Kreisklasse A Kiel  VIII  ddffdd\\" 3rd ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2007–08  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Kiel  VII  ffcccc\\" 15th ↓ - align=\\"center\\"  2008–09  align=\\"left\\" Kreisklasse A Kiel  rowspan=2 VIII  7th - align=\\"center\\"  2009–10  align=\\"left\\" Kreisklasse A Kiel  ddffdd\\" 1st ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2010–11  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Kiel  VII  ddffdd\\" 2nd ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2011–12  align=\\"left\\" Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein-Nord-Ost  rowspan=2 VI  2nd - align=\\"center\\"  2012–13  align=\\"left\\" Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein-Nord- Ost  ddffdd\\" 1st ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2013–14  align=\\"left\\" Schleswig-Holstein-Liga  rowspan=2 V  11th - align=\\"center\\"  2014–15  align=\\"left\\" Schleswig-Holstein-Liga  ddffdd\\" 1st ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2015–16  align=\\"left\\" Regionalliga Nord  IV  ffcccc\\" 18th ↓ - align=\\"center\\"  2016–17  align=\\"left\\" Schleswig-Holstein-Liga rowspan=3 V  8th - align=\\"center\\"  2017–18  align=\\"left\\" Oberliga Schleswig-Holstein  12th - align=\\"center\\"  2018–19  align=\\"left\\" Oberliga Schleswig-Holstein  ffcccc\\" 16th ↓ - align=\\"center\\"  2019–20  colspan=3  inactive } * With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.

It was constructed between 1828 and 1830 and consecrated in 1831. The construction was completed through the donation of Yuzbashi (captain) Piluman Tayiryants, during the reign of tsar Nicholas I of Russia and Catholicos John VIII of Armenia. ==History== 13th-century khachkars near the church As early as the 13th century, the area of modern-day Vanadzor was called Gharakilisa -meaning the black church in Turkic- by the Seljuks possibly. This name was derived from the black-stoned ancient Armenian church of the Holy Mother of God, probably built in the 13th century during the rule of the Zakarid princes of Armenia. However, the current building of the church was built between 1828 and 1830 to replace the ancient church ruined during the 1826 Gharakilisa earthquake. The new church was built with orange and black colored tufa stones brought from Gyumri. It represents a single-nave domed basilica. In 1853, a school was opened in the churchyard. The church was completely renovated in 1900 by the Tayiryants family. Holy Mother of God of Vanadzor was among the few churches in Armenia that continued to operate as a place of worship during the Soviet rule.History of the Armenian Church In 1966, the belfry of the church was added at its entrance. Khachkars (cross-stones) dating back to the 13th century are found in the churchyard. The latest renovation at the church took place in 1999.Parishes in the Region of Lori ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Vanadzor Category:Churches completed in 1831 Vanadzor Category:Tourist attractions in Lori Province ","title":"Church of the Holy Mother of God, Vanadzor"},{"id":"46763239","text":"The Milli Yakjehti Council (, MYC, also called the National Alliance for Religious Harmony) is a Pakistani non-political alliance of political and non- political religious parties formed in 1995 on the advise of Maulana Naeem Siddiqui(the founder of tehreek e islami) to unite religious parties and reduce sectarian tensions in the nation.

Madhuri Dixit is an Indian actress known for her work in Hindi films. She made her acting debut in 1984 with Abodh where she portrayed a young bride. Dixit went on to appear in several films over the next three years, including the dramas Awara Baap (1985) and Swati (1986), though none of them garnered her much recognition. The role of Mohini in N. Chandra's action romance Tezaab proved to be a breakthrough for Dixit. The film went on to become the highest- grossing film of that year. For her performance, Dixit received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. She achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in several top-grossing action-dramas, including Ram Lakhan (1989), Tridev (1989), and Kishen Kanhaiya (1990). The role of a wealthy brat in the 1990 romantic drama Dil earned Dixit her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. The following year, she starred in another box-office hit Saajan, and won a second Best Actress award at Filmfare for portraying the role of a strong woman who rebels against her manipulative mother-in-law in the 1992 drama Beta. She featured alongside Jackie Shroff and Sanjay Dutt in the action thriller Khalnayak (1993), one of the highest-grossing films of that year. Subsequently, she played an avenger in the drama Anjaam (1994) to positive reviews. Dixit's subsequent release was Sooraj Barjatya's Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), a family drama which emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film to that point. The following year, she featured in Raja (1995) which was a blockbuster film of that year and Yaraana in which she played a woman who attempts an escape from her abusive husband. Both of her releases in 1996—Rajkumar and Prem Granth—were financial failures. Dixit's portrayal of a headstrong dancer in Yash Chopra's 1997 romance Dil To Pagal Hai was a major success, earning her a fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She garnered critical acclaim for her work in the dramas Mrityudand (1997), Wajood (1998) and Pukar (2000). She portrayed five roles in the experimental film Gaja Gamini (2000). Dixit was praised for her supporting role as a woman fighting against gender discrimination in Lajja (2001), a drama on women's rights, which performed poorly at the box-office. The year 2002 saw Dixit starring in two romantic dramas, including Devdas opposite Shah Rukh Khan, in which she played the Chandramukhi character, a courtesan in love with an alcoholic. For the film, she won a Filmfare Award in the Best Supporting Actress category. After a five-year absence from the screen, Dixit played a leading role in Anil Mehta's dance film Aaja Nachle (2007). Despite the film's failure at the box- office, her performance was praised. The widely praised role of a con woman Begum Para in Abhishek Chaubey's black comedy film Dedh Ishqiya (2014) marked her first acting role in seven years, she received her 14th Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for it. She followed it by playing the leader of a vigilante group in the action crime drama Gulaab Gang. She made her debut in Marathi cinema with the 2018 comedy drama Bucket List. Her highest-grossing release came with the adventure comedy Total Dhamaal (2019), which ranks among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. In addition to her acting career, Dixit has hosted Kahin Na Kahin Koi Hai, a reality show on arranged marriages and has served as a talent judge for four seasons of the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa and Dance Deewane for two seasons. ==Films== {  +Key  ffc;\\"  Denotes films that have not yet been released } { class=\\" sortable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"margin-right: 0;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Role(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  -  1984 !scope=\\"row\\" Abodh  Gauri   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1985 !scope=\\"row\\" Awara Baap  Barkha   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1986 !scope=\\"row\\" Swati  Anandi   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1987 !scope=\\"row\\" Hifazat  Janki   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1987 !scope=\\"row\\" Uttar Dakshin  Chanda   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1988 !scope=\\"row\\" Mohre  Maya   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1988 !scope=\\"row\\" Khatron Ke Khiladi  Kavita   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1988 !scope=\\"row\\" Dayavan    style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1988 !scope=\\"row\\" Tezaab  Mohini  Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Vardi  Jaya   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Ram Lakhan    style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Prem Pratigyaa   Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Ilaaka  Vidya   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Mujrim  Sonia   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Tridev    style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Kanoon Apna Apna  Bharathi   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Parinda  Paro   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1989 !scope=\\"row\\" Paap Ka Ant Nisha   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Maha-Sangram  Jhumri   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Kishen Kanhaiya  Anju   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Izzatdaar  Mohini   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Dil   Filmfare Award for Best Actress  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin  Anita   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Jeevan Ek Sanghursh    style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Sailaab    style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Jamai Raja  Rekha   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1990 !scope=\\"row\\" Thanedaar  Chanda   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1991 !scope=\\"row\\" Pyar Ka Devta  Radha   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1991 !scope=\\"row\\" 100 Days  Devi   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1991 !scope=\\"row\\" Pratikar  Madhu   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1991 !scope=\\"row\\" Saajan  Pooja  Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1991 !scope=\\"row\\" Prahaar  Shirley   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1992 !scope=\\"row\\" Beta  Saraswati  Filmfare Award for Best Actress  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1992 !scope=\\"row\\"Zindagi Ek Jua  Juhi   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1992 !scope=\\"row\\"Prem Deewane    style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1992 !scope=\\"row\\"Khel  Seema, Jhari Bhuti   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1992 !scope=\\"row\\" Sangeet  Sangeeta, Nirmala   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1993 !scope=\\"row\\" Dharavi  Dreamgirl   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1993 !scope=\\"row\\" Sahibaan  Sahibaan   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1993 !scope=\\"row\\" Khalnayak   Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1993 !scope=\\"row\\" Phool  Guddi   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1993 !scope=\\"row\\" Dil Tera Aashiq  , Sonia Khanna   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  1993 !scope=\\"row\\" Aasoo Bane Angaarey  Usha, Madhu   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1994 !scope=\\"row\\" Anjaam   Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  1994 !scope=\\"row\\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!

[Her] work is particularly notable for the degree of difficulty in obtaining information about the most complex and under-scrutinized aspects of state government. Through her tenacity, no one has done more for the cause of freedom of information in recent years than Sydney.” According to Vice President and Washington Bureau Chief for E. W.

It aims to curb black money, or undisclosed foreign assets and income and imposes tax and penalty on such income. The Act has been passed by both the Houses of the Parliament. The Act has received the assent of the President of India on 26 May 2015. It came into effect from 1 July 2015. == Disclosure Opportunity == The goal of this law is to bring back the income and assets held abroad back to the country. As a result, only an Indian resident gets the opportunity to declare undisclosed assets. The government gives a time frame when someone can disclose assets. If the resident holding undisclosed assets declare the assets in the given time frame they are not subject to prosecution. The resident may want to disclose assets when they have not submitted a return on time, or if they filled and submitted a return they chose not to include certain assets or even when the taxpayer did not provide all the facts and thus the return could not be evaluated. There are instances when a taxpayer does not get the opportunity to disclose the income and assets. Information received on or before June 30, 2015 is not considered valid because of the date of the act. A resident with unsettled legal offense under the Indian law cannot disclose money. Disclosure opportunity is not available when the tax audit is still under surveillance with accordance to Indian tax laws. == Valuation == The valuation of undisclosed assets to calculate tax on will be done at Fair Market Price. == Computation == Under normal income tax act, taxpayers are subject to deduction but while computing for such undisclosed foreign assets and income no such deductions will be applicable. While computing, if the assets/income are movable then value computed will be used to calculate the tax but if it is taxed prior then that value would be subtracted from the undisclosed income/asset.

He was also a historian and author, closely connected to the history of Nova Scotia, having served as a minister at St. Matthew's United Church (Halifax). ==LifeEarly years=== Brown was born on 22 August 1763 in Biggar, South Lanarkshire, the son of Richard Brown, a weaver, and Isabella Forrest. He studied theology at the University of Glasgow and became a licensed minister in 1786, serving in his home town of Biggar. He graduated as a Doctor of Divinity from the University of Edinburgh in absentia, in 1788. ===In North America=== In 1787 Brown crossed the Atlantic to serve as a minister in St Matthews Church in Halifax, Nova Scotia and also served as chaplin to the North British Society and British naval and army forces in the area.name=\\"DictCaBio He left Scotland before his studies for his doctorate were complete; graduating in absentia a year later. He stayed in North America until 1795. During this period he gathered historical information for a future publication on the history of North America. For the rest of his life this research continued but he failed to publish the materials. He attempted to compose the disputes between various factions in the parish and the region. He was particularly interested in the history of the Acadians both before and during their expulsion from Canada, and wrote sympathetically of them. He was strongly critical of Acting Governor Charles Lawrence for his role in the Expulsion of the Acadians. Brown came to the conclusion that the Expulsion was largely the work of a Council dominated by Boston interests, a conclusion which anticipated the later position of John Bartlet Brebner's New England's Outpost. Brebner may have been influenced by Brown's work. In 1791 Brown visited Philadelphia and met Benjamin Rush, who described Brown as \\"a man of genius learning and observation\\". Brown’s research appears to have included extended correspondence with the American historian Jeremy Belknap, whom he met during this same visit. ===Return to Scotland=== Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh In 1792 Brown briefly returned to Scotland to marry his first wife before returning with her to Nova Scotia. He returned to Scotland permanently in 1795, finding employment as a minister of Lochmaben Church in Dumfriesshire. In 1799 he received a prestigious position at New Greyfriars in Edinburgh and in 1801 translated to the other half of the building, Old Greyfriars (the church at that time being physically split in two to serve two parishes). In the same year (1801) he replaced the recently deceased Professor Hugh Blair as Professor of Rhetoric and Belle Lettres at the University of Edinburgh and served this role until his own death. He was aided in securing this position by a recommendation from Prince William Henry. Brown had travelled with the Prince on his return to Scotland in 1795. Brown was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1803. He was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1813 by his fellow ministers. Brown continued his research after his return to Scotland (covering the period 1790 to 1815) but it was not published during his lifetime. He wrote several drafts of what he intended to be a comprehensive History of North America, but it was never completed and published. He died in Carrington, Midlothian near Edinburgh on 19 February 1834, and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh city centre. ==Family== He married Daniel (sic) Cranstoun at Harvieston near Dollar, Clackmannanshire on 10 September 1792. They had two children. He married a second time on 2 March 1805 to Mary Grant, the marriage taking place in Edinburgh. His final marriage was to a widow, Mary Pearson, on 10 March 1830 in Edinburgh. ==Publications== *A Sermon on the Dangers and Duties of Seafaring Life (1793) *Love of Country Explained and Illustrated (1801) *The Standard of Excellence Established in the Gospel (1810) *Notice of the Life and Character of Prof Alexander Christison (1820) *The Belknap Papers *Removal of the French Inhabitants of Nova Scotia in 1755.

Ernesto Rossetti was the stationmaster in the small Apulian village of San Vito dei Normanni. He lived happily with his wife and his little son, Gabriele. However, Ernesto had artistic ambitions and was fond of Paul Cezanne's painting after he saw the artist's water colour self-portrait at Bari. Ernesto wanted to make an exhibition in his homage to the country, but the local art critic, truncated and conceited, stunned the exhibition with a newspaper article. Ernesto did not win for himself. He copied to Cezanne's work, neglecting the family especially Gabriele, who began to grow afraid of him and hate him. On the birthday of his son, Ernesto showed the professor (local art critic) the new picture; and the professor again negatively commented the work, stirring up Ernesto's wrath, giving an inconvenient shock to his son Gabriele. When Gabriele grew up, he eventually discovered that Ernesto had deceived everyone with the second painting, which he replaced with the original painting of Paul Cezanne, in order to prove the deceit of the villagers and the professor. == Cast == *Sergio Rubini as Ernesto Rossetti *Valeria Golino as Franca *Riccardo Scamarcio as Pinuccio * Guido Giaquinto as Gabriele Rossetti *Anna Falchi as Donna Valeria Giordano *Mario Maranzana as Museum Director * Vito Signorile as Professor Venusio *Maurizio Micheli as Lawyer Pezzetti *Mariolina De Fano as Mrs. Lo Turco *Fabrizio Gifuni as Gabriele Rossetti (Adult) *Margherita Buy as Anna == References  External links == * Category:2009 comedy-drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Sergio Rubini ","title":"The Cézanne Affair"},{"id":"46764006","text":"A Small Southern Enterprise () is a 2013 Italian comedy film written, directed and starred by Rocco Papaleo.

In 1981, he passed the judicial examination and in December of 1982, he started his career as prosecutor with the Chuncheon District Prosecutor's Office. He worked as a public security inspector with the Supreme Public Prosecutors' Office and the Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office. He also wrote a book on the national security law called the \\"Public Security Investigation Textbook.\\" After serving as the Chief Inspector of the Busan High Prosecutors' Office in 2011, he served as an attorney at the Pacific Law Firm from September 19, 2011 to January 2013. In 2013, he became the 63rd Minister of Justice. During his tenure as a minister of justice, he played a leading role in the investigation and conviction of Lee Seok-ki, and of the dissolution of the Unified Progressive Party. He was nominated as the 44th Prime Minister in May 2015 and assumed office on June 18, 2015. On December 9, 2016, President Park Geun- hye's proclamation of impeachment passed, and he assumed the role of president until May 9, 2017. In January, 2019, he joined the Liberty Korea Party, and was elected to the presidency on February 27th. He served as Acting President of South Korea following the impeachment and removal of President Park Geun- hye by the Constitutional Court of Korea on 10 March 2017, until the election of Moon Jae-in on 9 May 2017. He had already taken over Park's presidential powers and duties on 9 December 2016 when impeachment proceedings were launched against her by the National Assembly and she was suspended from the powers and duties of the office. == Early life and education== Hwang was born on April 15, 1957.Minister's Profile, MOJ, Ministry of Justice, Republic of Korea (accessed December 11, 2016). He graduated from Kyunggi High School in 1976. He received his LL.B in 1981 from the College of Law at Sungkyunkwan University, and passed the 23rd National Bar Exam the same year. He is a member of the Korea Baptist Convention. Hwang managed to avoid the mandatory military service which all Korean male adults are required to complete by claiming a rare case of hives. Hwang earned his LL.M. in 2006 from the Graduate School of Law at Sungkyunkwan University. ==As prosecutor== Hwang was a career prosecutor. He spent 30 years as a prosecutor, specializing in enforcing public safety and national security laws under the military junta of Chun Doo-hwan, gaining particular notoriety for targeting democracy activists by linking them with North Korea.Koichi Kato, Meet South Korea's new leader, Hwang Kyo-ahn: Conservative prosecutor has history of friction with opposition, The Nikkei (December 10, 2016). ==Administrative careerJustice Minister (2013–2015)=== Hwang joined the Cabinet of South Korean President Park Geun-hye in 2013 as minister of justice. In that role, Hwang played a key role in the Constitutional Court case against the left-wing Unified Progressive Party (which was accused of holding pro-North Korean views); the case culminated in a controversial December 2014 order banning the party, a decision that some saw as a blow to freedom of speech in South Korea.S. Korea's interim leader was Park defender; powers unclear, Associated Press (December 9, 2016). === Prime Minister (2015–2017) === On May 21, 2015, Park named Hwang as Prime Minister of South Korea, following the resignation of Lee Wan-koo due to allegations of bribery. In July 2016, Hwang was heckled and pelted with eggs and water bottles by crowds in the rural town of Seongju, who were opposed to deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (a U.S. missile defense system) in the area.South Korean prime minister pelted with eggs by protesters, Agence France-Presse (July 15, 2016). The deployment plans angered local residents, who raised health and environmental concerns. Hwang \\"was regarded as the staunchest loyalist in Park's cabinet.\\" Nevertheless, on November 2, 2016, one month before her impeachment, Park fired Hwang as Prime Minister amid the 2016 South Korean political scandal as Park tried to rebuild confidence in her administration.Jonathan Cheng, South Korea President Park Geun-hye Impeached: Decision on removal will come from Constitutional Court, Wall Street Journal (December 9, 2016). However, after \\"a dispute with opposition leaders over choosing a replacement,\\" Hwang was kept in office as prime minister. Afterwards, Hwang attended the APEC meeting, which was held in Peru, on behalf of Park. == Acting President (2016–2017) == Hwang meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in February 2017 Hwang meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on March 17, 2017 On December 9, 2016, upon the National Assembly's vote to impeach President Park following a political scandal, Hwang assumed Park's presidential powers and duties as Acting President.The latest: S. Korea PM officially becomes acting president, Associated Press (December 9, 2016). On March 10, 2017, South Korea's Constitutional Court upheld the decision to impeach President Park Geun-hye and removed her from office. As a result, Hwang continued as Acting President of South Korea until new elections in early May, which were brought forward from December due to the constitution requiring new elections within 60 days of a permanent presidential vacancy. On assuming the powers of the presidency, Hwang said he felt \\"deep responsibility\\". The exact extent of Hwang's powers as acting president are unclear under South Korean law. His first field tour as acting president was to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in central Seoul, where he emphasized national security and stated \\"We are facing a grave security status, as we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of North Korean provocations near the Northern Limit Line (NLL).\\"Hwang visits JCS in first field tour as acting president, Yonhap News Agency (December 11, 2016). Hwang decided against contesting the South Korean 2017 presidential election, declaring it would be inappropriate to run, opting instead to focus on his position as Acting President. He was previously seen as the leading candidate for conservatives within the country, leaving them searching for a viable candidate other than Hwang to challenge leading contender Moon Jae-in for the presidency. He resigned as Prime Minister on May 11, 2017, after the election of his successor as president. == Political career (2018–2020) == In November 2018, Hwang joined the Liberty Korea Party. He announced in January 2019 that he would be seeking the party's leadership position. On February 27, 2019, he won Liberty Korea Party leadership election with 50.1 percent of the vote. In 2020, Hwang is running for the Jongno district seat in Seoul, which includes the Blue House and Gwanghwamun Square. Having led his party to a landslide defeat in the legislative election, Hwang resigned from the leadership on April 15th. == Religion == He is a Protestant with a devout Baptist church, who also attended a night seminary and served as a church preacher.

In a 2015 interview, he claimed human activity to be responsible for floods of the Narmada, the water of which is stored in the trees and mountains of its bank that seeps into it forming the actual catchment area. He held the release of chemicals into the catchment area responsible for aiding climate change in the region, and added that, \\"Climate change, in near future, will reduce Narmada into a cricket pitch as the river will die due to irresponsible human activities.\\" He opposed big river projects and felt that those older than 20 years must go through social and economic audit to evaluate what was gained and lost from them.

He was brought to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at 8:45 a.m. (IST) in a state of cardiac arrest. Efforts to revive him failed and was pronounced dead at 9:45 a.m. (IST). He had been diagnosed with pneumonia early in 2017 and had not completely recovered. He was unmarried. In a will written in July 2012, he had expressed a wish that his funeral be performed in accordance to Vedic rituals and \\"if possible, cremation ... be performed on the banks of river Narmada at Bandrabhan where Nadi Mahotsav was organised\\".

Retired Vermont Associate Justice Allen R. Sturtevant (right), serves as a witness. Olin Merrill Jeffords was born in Enosburg Falls, Vermont on June 8, 1890, the son of James Merrill Jeffords (1863–1926) and Mary D. (Merrill) Jeffords (1849–1918). He graduated from Enosburg Falls High School in 1909 and Phillips Exeter Academy in 1911. Jeffords worked in his father's drug store until 1915, when he decided to attend law school. He graduated from Boston University Law School in 1918, was admitted to the bar, and became an attorney. He practiced with Ropes & Gray in Boston, and then returned to Vermont to practice in Ludlow with the firm of William W. Stickney and John G. Sargent. He later moved to Rutland, where he continued to practice as a partner in a firm that grew to include several prominent attorneys, including Leonard F. Wing. A Republican, in 1934 Jeffords was appointed a Judge of the Vermont Superior Court. Jeffords rose by seniority to become the court's chief judge, a post he held briefly in 1938. Later in 1938, Jeffords was appointed an Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, in keeping with Vermont's tradition of promoting the chief judge of the Superior Court as Supreme Court vacancies arose. He filled the vacancy caused by the death of Chief Justice George M. Powers and promotion of Associate Justice Sherman R. Moulton to succeed Powers. In 1955 Jeffords became Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, succeeding John C. Sherburne, who had retired. Jeffords served until resigning in 1958. He was succeeded by Walter H. Cleary. ==Death and burial== Jeffords died in Rutland on October 10, 1964. He was buried at Missisquoi Cemetery in Enosburg Falls. ==Awards and honors== In 1939 Jeffords was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. from Boston University.

It was released on May 21, 2015. In Sunset, Angela, an African-American housekeeper, is working for Gabriel Ortega in the fictional country of Anchuria, where she is visiting. ==Gameplay== Sunset is played from a first person perspective. Angela Burnes, an American citizen who is visiting the fictional country of Anchuria, has to perform numerous housekeeping tasks an hour before sunset. As she performs her tasks, the player finds out more about the Civil War and the dictator that currently leads Anchuria. As time goes by, changes occur both within the house and in the city which Angela can see through the windows. ==Development== Sunset was announced by Tale of Tales in a March 2014 press release. The press release detailed the developers' collaborators, Austin Wintory would be providing the soundtrack, and Leigh Alexander and Ste Curran would act as consultants. The ideas behind Sunset had been developing at Tale of Tales for many years prior to its announcement. Tale of Tales describe The Apartment, a 2005 game prototype released as part of the developers 10 year anniversary bundle as \\"an early related sketch\\". Sunset was originally envisaged as a romance between the player character and the apartment's inhabitant. During the game's development, Tales refocused the game to explore how everyday life continues against the backdrop of war. Though war may not be as immediate to the player as it is in Sunset, Tale of Tales state that \\"we are all living our lives while in the background a war is going on\\", \\"Sunset is about all of our lives, the lives we all lead: in our peaceful apartments while the world is burning outside.\\" The game was part funded by the Flanders Audiovisual Fund, and further funding came from a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign which began in June 2014, it achieved its $25,000 goal and raised $67,636 in July 2014 The increased Kickstarter funding allowed Tale of Tales to expand on the player character, Angela Burnes' presence within the game through additional art, animation and narrative. Burnes was inspired by Angela Davis, Pam Grier, and Nina Simone. Tale of Tale's Aureia Harvey's experience as an American expatriate informed Burnes' character. The choice of the 1970s setting drew from Tale of Tales' belief that the period represented a shift, a time worth exploring when \\"Western culture morphed from an authoritarian civilization based on rules of decency and formal traditions to an egalitarian society that celebrates individual freedom above all\\". Tale of Tales spoke of recapturing a spirit of innocence, where belief in social change through popular revolution was still alive. The apartment in which the game is set is based upon a design for the \\"ideal bachelor pad\\" from a 1970 issue of Playboy; its contents were inspired the contents of Yves Saint Laurent's Paris apartment. The game's central story, told through the interaction of a cleaner and the apartment inhabitant was partly inspired by the film Chungking Express. Sunset was released worldwide on May 21, 2015, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. ==Reception== The game received a score of 65/100 on reviews aggregation website Metacritic based on 33 reviews, indicating a mixed response. Michael Thomsen of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Sunset creates a beautiful and sometimes-unnervingly artificial platform for the alienating role-play bound up in employer-employee relationships, staged against a backdrop of historical revolution that threatens to spoil it.\\" Edge awarded the game a score of 9/10, describing it as \\"an enormously affecting examination of the impact of war. Not on soldiers or politicians, but on everyone else - those who can only watch from the sidelines.\\" Joe Donnelly of Digital Spy rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"It's a unique take on the war-based theme, and will evoke your inner voyeur, dazzling in its moments of exposition as well as its suggestive junctures.\\" IGN awarded it a score of 8.0 out of 10, saying, \\"Taken slowly, Sunset is a beautiful, fascinating experience.\\" Taylor Wilde of PC Gamer rated it 68/100 and wrote, \\"Sunsets themes, setting, and plot are plenty interesting, but the player's interaction with them feels incongruous.\\" Writing for Game Informer, Kimberley Wallace rated it 5.75/10 and said, \\"The story is fascinating, but the gameplay quickly becomes humdrum and the technical problems are extremely frustrating\\". Tale of Tales characterized Sunset as a commercial failure, as it sold 4,000 copies in its first month of release, half of which were reserved for Kickstarter backers. Following this failure, Tale of Tales announced that they would no longer pursue commercial video game projects. ===Awards=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" - ! colspan=\\"4\\" B0C4DE;\\"  List of awards and nominations - ! ccc;\\"  Award ! ccc;\\"  Category ! ccc;\\"  Result ! ccc;\\"  Ref. -  The Game Awards 2015  Games for Change   } ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2015 video games Category:First-person adventure games Category:Indie video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games developed in Belgium Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in 1972 Category:Windows games ","title":"Sunset (video game)"},{"id":"46764211","text":"Tubo-ovarian abscesses are one of the late complications of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and can be life-threatening if the abscess ruptures and results in sepsis. It consists of an encapsulated or confined 'pocket of pus' with defined boundaries that forms during an infection of a fallopian tube and ovary. These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection.Pelvic inflammatory disease. American Family Physician, Vol. 85, No. 8. (15 April 2012), pp. 791-796 by Margaret Gradison It is an inflammatory mass involving the fallopian tube, ovary and, occasionally, other adjacent pelvic organs. A TOA can also develop as a complication of a hysterectomy. Patients typically present with fever, elevated white blood cell count, lower abdominal-pelvic pain, and/or vaginal discharge. Fever and leukocytosis may be absent. TOAs are often polymicrobial with a high percentage of anaerobic bacteria. The cost of treatment in the United States is approximately $2,000 per patient, which equals about $1.5 billion annually. Though rare, TOA can occur without a preceding episode of PID or sexual activity. ==Signs and symptoms== Bacteroides fragilis The signs and symptoms of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) are the same as with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with the exception that the abscess can be found with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sonography and x-ray. It also differs from PID in that it can create symptoms of acute-onset pelvic pain. Typically this disease is found in sexually active women.. Tubo- ovarian abscess can mimic abdominal tumours. ===Complications=== Complications of TOA are related to the possible removal of one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes. Without these reproductive structures, fertility can be affected. Surgical complications can develop and include: * Allergic shock due to anesthetics * A paradoxical reaction to a drug * Infection ==Cause== The development of TOA is thought to begin with the pathogens spreading from the cervix to the endometrium, through the salpinx, into the peritoneal cavity and forming the tubo-ovarian abscess with (in some cases) pelvic peritonitis. TOA can develop from the lymphatic system with infection of the parametrium from an intrauterine device (IUD). Bacteria recovered from TOAs are Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, and aerobic streptococci. Long term IUD use is associated with TOA. Actinomyces is also recovered from TOA. {  + ! Genus !! species !!

Physicians are able to make the diagnosis if the abscess ruptures when the woman begins to have lower abdominal pain that then begins to spread. The symptoms then become the same as the symptoms for peritonitis. Sepsis occurs, if left untreated. Ultrasonography is a sensitive enough imaging tool that it can accurately differentiate between pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, endometriosis, ovarian torsion, and tubo-ovarian abscess. Its availability, the relative advancement in the training of its use, its low cost, and because it does not expose the woman (or fetus) to ionizing radiation, ultrasonography an ideal imaging procedure for women of reproductive age. ==Prevention== Risk factors have been identified which indicate what women will be more likely to develop TOA. These are: increased age, IUD insertion, chlamydia infection, and increased levels of certain proteins (CRP and CA-125) and will alert clinicians to follow up on unresolved symptoms of PID. ==Treatment== Treatment for TOA differs from PID in that some clinicians recommend patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses have at least 24 hours of inpatient parenteral treatment with antibiotics, and that they may require surgery. If surgery becomes necessary, pre-operative administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is started and removal of the abscess, the affected ovary and fallopian tube is done. After discharge from the hospital, oral antibiotics are continued for the length of time prescribed by the physician. Treatment is different if the TOA is discovered before it ruptures and can be treated with IV antibiotics. During this treatment, IV antibiotics are usually replaced with oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Patients are usually seen three days after hospital discharge and then again one to two weeks later to confirm that the infection has cleared. Ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline is effective against C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and anaerobes in women with tubo-ovarian abscess. Parenteral Regimens described by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention are Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours and Doxycycline 200 mg orally or IV every 24 hours, though other regiments that are used for pelvic inflammatory disease have been effective.https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/pid.htm ==Epidemiology== The epidemiology of TOA is closely related to that of pelvic inflammatory disease which is estimated to one million people yearly. ==References External links == link= Category:Abdominal pain Category:Sexually transmitted diseases and infections Category:Bacterial diseases Category:Chlamydia infections Category:Infections with a predominantly sexual mode of transmission Category:Inflammatory diseases of female pelvic organs Category:Reproductive system Category:Gynaecology Category:Sexual health Category:Mycoplasma ","title":"Tubo-ovarian abscess"},{"id":"46764212","text":"Stop Procrastinating is an internet and website blocking computer software that restricts access to the Internet or specific websites for a set amount of time to avoid or limit online distraction. It has become a popular tool for students, writers, home workers and self-employed entrepreneurs as well for parents to help control and limited their children's internet use. It is also used extensively by men trying to break their addiction to pornography. The software has become a notable and popular tool with students as a way to block internet distraction while studying. It has been covered extensively by national university publications and undergraduate student publications. It has been reviewed by College News, the most visited student online news and review website in the US and was recommended as being \\"the best internet blocker on the market.\\" Influential college publications at the leading US universities of Georgia, Iowa, and Arizona have confirmed the software's popular appeal and how it has become an essential tool for students to study undistracted by the internet, citing downloads of more than 12,000 in just a few weeks. Stop Procrastinating is also recognised for its influential and extensive independent research about the impact of the internet. A recent influential study undertaken with thousands of parents became international headline news as it was shown that parents face a dilemma as parents felt that they couldn't prevent their children from using the internet, despite evidence that it affects their concentration, because they needed it to study. The issue was a concern for both parents and educational authorities as the move to internet based learning was seen to encourage greater internet use by children. The issue was covered in-depth and as headline news by Judith Burns, an expert educational correspondent at the BBC, one of the world's most reputable news outlets. It's extensive research into how the internet significantly lowers the productivity of employees at work was covered by national newspaper outlets across the world, including in the UK, the Daily Telegraph and in Spain by El Pais, the most read newspaper in Spanish. ==Features== The software allows users to set a time from one minute to 24 hours and then chose one of three options to block the internet for the time period they have selected. One option allows users to block the internet connection completely but reconnect to the internet by restarting the computer before the time is completed, while a second option prevents users getting back online until the time is up, even if they restart. The software offers a third option called a blacklist, where users can list websites they wish to block, thus still having access to the internet connection, except for the websites they have listed. It was set up by a group of freelance writers and programmers who claim they needed to develop a tool to help cut online distraction. The application is described as helping students, writers, self- employed workers, businesses, office workers, and teenagers who want to block the internet in order to complete their homework, and as a parental control.

It was formed in 2012 at Daresbury Laboratory on the Sci-Tech Daresbury science and innovation campus in Cheshire, UK. The Hartree Centre is part of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) which itself is part of United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI). ==Background== The Hartree Centre takes its name from English mathematician and physicist Douglas Rayner Hartree. It was formed in 2012 with £37.5 million government funding for research into supercomputing. The centre’s purpose is to provide UK industry and academia with access to advanced high performance computing technologies, expertise and training to boost UK economic growth and \\"to develop technologies such as batteries for mobile phones\\". In 2014, the centre was allocated an additional £19 million for research into energy efficient computing and big data, such as that which will be generated by the Square Kilometre Array. In the 2014 Autumn Statement, government announced a further investment of £115 million for the centre over five years, to fund future scientific discovery in research areas including cognitive computing and big data analytics. This was part of the Northern Powerhouse strategy to boost economic growth in the North of England. In 2014, the Hartree Centre became an official Intel Parallel Computing Centre. The Hartree Centre is a base for one of the IBM Research teams in the UK and the University of Liverpool Virtual Engineering Centre. According to the Annual Report from 2017-2018, the Hartree Centre was funded with £115.5mm for the financial year ending 31 March 2018.[ ==Technologies== The Hartree Centre hosts a number of supercomputing platforms including: * Scafell Pike, a Bull Sequana X1000 * Lenovo NeXtScale * Lenovo System x iDataPlex system * IBM POWER8 + NVLink + Tesla P100 * IBM POWER8 + Nvidia K80 In 2017, Scafell Pike became the first Bull Sequana X1000 to be installed in the UK. The centre also houses large scale GPFS storage and experimental technologies such as a Maxeler FPGA system, ARM 64-bit platform, a ClusterVision-built novel cooling demonstrator based on mineral oil, and Intel Xeon Phi co-processing technologies. ===Past Technologies=== The Hartree Centre formerly hosted supercomputer Blue Joule, an IBM Blue Gene/Q. In June 2012, the year of its installation at Daresbury Laboratory, the TOP500 project ranked Blue Joule as the most powerful non-distributed computing system in the UK and 13th in the world. In 2016, Blue Joule was upcycled into the DiRAC facility at the Institute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University. ==Energy Efficient Computing== In 2012, the centre was awarded government funding to strengthen UK competitiveness in areas including big data and energy efficient computing. Energy efficient computing is becoming an influential research topic for the future sustainability of high performance computing, the Hartree Centre is carrying out research which takes a holistic view of parallel computing systems, including the optimisation of software to make it run more efficiently, low power architectures, data storage, cooling methods and other factors. In 2015 Lenovo entered into partnership with the centre to develop energy efficient computing solutions using an ARM-based server prototype. ==Work With Industry == The Hartree Centre works with academic researchers and companies in a wide range of industries, on projects including software development and optimisation, big data analytics, collaborative R&D; and training. ===Notable Projects=== * As of 2013, the Hartree Centre had a long-term partnership with Unilever to develop their R&D; processes and make better use of high performance computing, specifically computer aided formulation. One of the research projects undertaken resulted in an “app” that focuses on ease of use to put complex supercomputing tools in the hands of chemists. The tool is claimed to enable product experimentation that would previously take a week to be carried out in 40 minutes. * In 2014 the centre ran a competition in partnership with the Open Data Institute and IBM. Entrepreneurs were allowed to submit their concepts to use publicly available open data for commercial applications. The winning ideas were given time on the Hartree Centre machines with IBM data scientists to prove their concept was commercially viable. One winning company, UK SME Democrata, has created a tool through the project, which analyses and maps open data from a variety of archaeological, geological and land based sources to help large construction and infrastructure companies and projects to predict risk and avoid disturbing sites of historical significance. The tool uses two components of IBM Watson and Hadoop data repositories. * In June 2015, Minister for Universities and Science Jo Johnson announced a renewed partnership between the Hartree Centre and IBM which provides the centre with access to £200 million worth of IBM's data-centric and cognitive computing technologies and expertise, including IBM Watson. * In May 2016, the Hartree Centre announced a collaboration with Alder Hey Children's Hospital to create the UK's first \\"cognitive hospital\\", using the IBM Watson cognitive computing platform to improve the patient journey and experience. The project won \\"Most Innovative Collaboration\\" at the North West Coast Research and Innovation Awards 2017. The Alder Play app was launched and made available to the public in December 2017, featuring the Ask Oli chat feature in beta. * From 2016 to 2019 the centre was one of five partners in the LCR 4.0 project to accelerate Industry 4.0 technologies into SMEs in the Liverpool City Region. The project's success was recognised locallyhttps://www.businesscloud.co.uk/news/lcr-40-to- generate-31m-and-955-jobs and nationally and named by the Financial Times as one of Europe's 100 Digital Champions. * In June 2019, the Industrial Digitalisation Accelerator was launched, a collaboration with Siemens and Atos enabling businesses to access, explore and integrate Industry 4.0 technologies in a low-risk environment. ==See also== *Supercomputing in Europe == External links == * The Hartree Centre ==References== Category:Computer science institutes in the United Kingdom Category:Information technology organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Research institutes in Cheshire Category:Science and Technology Facilities Council Category:Supercomputer sites ","title":"Hartree Centre"},{"id":"46764413","text":"The 1966 South Pacific Games, held at Nouméa in New Caledonia from 8–18 December 1966, was the second edition of the South Pacific Games. ==Participating countries== Fourteen Pacific nations or territories participated in the Games: ==Sports== Twelve sports were contested at the 1966 South Pacific Games: Note: A number in parentheses indicates how many medal events were contested in that sport (where known). ==Final medal table== In a significant turnaround of fortunes backed by French government investment, New Caledonia took the mantle at the top of the medal table from Fiji and French Polynesia obtained third position. ==See also== *Athletics at the 1966 South Pacific Games *Football at the 1966 South Pacific Games *Rugby union at the 1966 South Pacific Games ==Notes== Men's and women's basketball (five-a-side) competitions were held.

His grandfather was Conrad (Peter) Petrus Dias Wijewardena Bandaranaike, Maha Mudaliyar and his cousin was S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Bandaranayake was educated at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, St. Thomas' College, Matara and studied agriculture at the University of Travancore. While in India he met figures such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Rabindranath Tagore. On his return he joined the newly formed Ceylon Agricultural Corps as a Commandant during World War II.Former Gampaha MP S.D. Bandaranayake the Colourful Maverick Known as \\"Imbulgoda Veeraya\\" Passes Away at 97 Years of Age ==Political career== After the war he entered politics, campaigning for his cousin S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and joined his newly formed Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He was elected to parliament in 1952 and was re-elected in 1956 however he did not accept the office due to disagreements with S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike on the Sinhala Only Act. Having been re-elected in the March 1960 general election as an independent contestant, but contested from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and was re-elected in the July 1960 general election. He was re-elected at the 1965 general election, from 1965 to 1970, Bandaranayake was representing Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist) views in the parliament. During the struggles in the North against caste oppression and untouchability, he spoke in support of the struggles in parliament as well as visited the North with N. Shanmugathasan and K.A. Subramaniam to personally express solidarity with the struggling masses. In 1966 he questioned in the parliament regarding the mass uprising procession held from Chunnakam on 21st October 1966 to protest the caste oppression. Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist) took the decision to carry forward the struggle and to conduct the procession in defiance of the ban by the Police, this gave revolutionary enthusiasm to all the fronts of the Party. The blow struck on the procession opposing casteism in Chunnakam on 21st October 1966, many cadres were brutally assaulted by the Police and received bleeding injuries. Another the time, during a parliamentary debate Bandaranayake dared to quote Lenin that “the parliament was a den of thieves” and declare that the Parliament of Ceylon too was a den of thieves. As a result he was forcefully removed from the House of Representatives and suspended from parliament for a week. He always supported the people and their just struggles. Bandaranayake, D. K. D. Jinendrapala, and Watson Fernando were arrested on 1 May 1969 in Colombo when the UNP Government banned the May Day rally. The Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist) key leaders were brutally assaulted and arrested by the Police in Jaffna. Among them K.A. Subramaniam bed ridden for months at the residence of N. Sanmugathasan for treatment. S. D. Bandaranayake questioned in the parliament regarding these atrocities against the mass rally held in Jaffna on 1st May 1969 to protest the ban. Bandaranayake spoke firmly in support of granting the Tamil people their just rights and campaigned for the rights of workers, peasants and plantation workers. As a result of his above political stand, he was a long standing friend of the Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist) and continued to maintain his bond with the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (Left) . He was involved in the 1971 JVP Insurrection against the SLFP led government under Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The Criminal Justice Commission which was set up to prosecute insurgents found him guilty of two counts of being a member of the JVP and attending the five lectures. He was given a suspended sentence of two years. In 1977, he was re-elected to parliament and served until 1989.http://www.island.lk/2007/03/27/opinion1.html Death of senior SLFP politician S. D.

Educated first at Wrexham School in Denbighshire, he moved to Chesterfield grammar school, Derbyshire, under the Rev. Dr. Burroughs. In 1741 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where his elder brother Edward Moises, later vicar of Masham, Yorkshire, was a fellow. He graduated B.A. in 1745, with a reputation as a classical scholar, and shortly elected a fellow of Peterhouse. In the same year he became an assistant in the school of his old teacher at Chesterfield, where he continued till 1749. In that year he proceeded M.A. Also in 1749, on the recommendation of Edmund Keene, Moises was appointed headmaster of Newcastle Free School, in succession to Richard Dawes. The school at the time had few pupils, but Moises raised standards, becoming admired for his consistent approach. In 1750 the corporation of Newcastle raised his salary, and on 21 April 1761 they appointed him to the morning-lectureship of All Saints' Church. On 14 June 1779, he was appointed master of St. Mary's Hospital, Newcastle. In 1787 Moises was presented to the rectory of Greystoke, Cumberland, and resigned the mastership of the school, after nearly 40 years; he was succeeded by his nephew, the Rev. Edward Moises, M.A., who was vicar of Hart and Hartlepool from 1811. After living at Greystoke for some years he resigned the rectory, at the patron's request, and he spent the last years of his life in Newcastle. In 1801 he was appointed one of the chaplains to his old pupil Lord Eldon, who had become Lord Chancellor. Moises died at his house in Northumberland Street, Newcastle, on 5 July 1806. ==Pupils== Moises taught the following prominent figures: John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon; William Scott, Lord Stowell; and Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood. Other pupils included: *John Brand *John Brewster *William Nicholas Darnell *John Marshall *George Walker ==Memorial== In 1810 a mural monument, executed by John Flaxman, with a Latin inscription composed by Sir William Scott, was erected to Moises in St Mary's porch, St Nicholas's Church.

For example, if one were to read about a singer who says \\"That was a brilliant performance\\" to her colleague after they both sang beautifully, the utterance would seem sincere and truthful. If the same utterance were made after both sang terribly, the utterance would be perceived as ironic. The very same utterance can have two entirely different interpretations as a function of the speaker's intended meaning. Experimental pragmatics adopts existing cognitive and psycholinguistic techniques in order to carry out its investigations. While developmental progressions can reveal how interlocutors across several ages interpret utterances with clear pragmatic potential, reading times can reveal how sentences are processed (as relatively easy or difficult). While EEGs can reveal sharp on-line measures for determining how a word is integrated into a sentence, fMRI can reveal what areas of the brain are recruited when processing one reading over another. Philosophers have laid the groundwork for much of the work in pragmatics. Modern investigations can be traced back to Paul Grice and his philosophical approach to utterance understanding. Grice’s initial contribution was to propose a novel analysis in which he distinguished between sentence meaning (what the words and grammar mean) and speaker’s meaning (what the speaker actually intended to communicate by uttering a sentence). According to Grice, understanding an utterance requires access to, or making hypotheses about, the speaker’s intention and thus involves going beyond the meanings of the words in the sentence. The experimental turn was the result of an effort to test theories that had until then relied largely on intuition. The most investigated topic in experimental pragmatics is scalar implicature, which concerns the way a weakly expressed utterance (e.g. Some of their identity documents are forgeries) is interpreted. While the linguistic meaning of the utterance is general (Some and perhaps all of their identity documents are forgeries), a listener can conceivably attribute to the speaker a more narrow (and more informative) interpretation (Some but not all of their identity documents are forgeries). While the narrower meaning seems readily accessible to our intuitions, the question is how does it emerge. The earliest experiments pitted an account that assumed that the narrower reading occurs automatically or by default against an account that argued that there are no such defaults, that all interpretations rely on context and that it is perfectly reasonable at times to adopt the more general reading (see Noveck & Reboul, 2008). While scalar implicatures continue to dominate discussion, other prominent topics that fall under the rubric of experimental pragmatics include irony, metaphor, metonymy, reference, and word-learning. ==XPrag conference== The growing impact of Experimental Pragmatics can be seen through the increasing number of conferences, workshops, grants, and jobs that have been devoted to it. In one recent announcement (September 2015) for a workshop entitled Trends in Experimental Pragmatics, and organized by the Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS) in Berlin, the organizers wrote: \\"The field of Experimental Pragmatics was founded by the publication of Noveck & Sperber (2004) who confidently wrote: 'this volume lays down the bases for a new field, Experimental Pragmatics, that draws on pragmatics, psycholinguistics and also on the psychology of reasoning.' The bold prediction has proven remarkably accurate: Experimental Pragmatics has since successfully established itself as an independent field of research, providing a new perspective on age-old pragmatic problems and inspiring new lines of inquiry. In addition to the fields Noveck & Sperber above mentioned, semantics, neuroscience and philosophy have also contributed to Experimental Pragmatics, but also been influenced by it.\\" The first workshop with the title Experimental Pragmatics took place in Luton, UK in 1998 and was organized by Billy Clark and Steve Nicolle under the auspices of the Linguistics Association of Great Britain (LAGB). The field began to catch on after a workshop in 2001 (organized by Ira Noveck and Dan Sperber in Lyon, France under the auspices of the European Science Foundation). The workshop organizers invited many of the pragmatists and psychologists who consistently relied on, or called for, experimental findings to support or test their pragmatic accounts. Participants in the workshop included Anne Bezuidenhout, Robyn Carston, Gennaro Chierchia, Billy Clark, Herb Clark, Ray Gibbs, Vittorio Girotto, Sam Glucksberg, Rachel Giora, Ira Noveck, Guy Politzer, Anne Reboul, Francois Recanati, Tony Sanford, Dan Sperber, Johan van der Auwera, Jean- Baptiste van der Henst, and Deirdre Wilson. Contributors to the volume (Noveck & Sperber, 2004) were those who pioneered the carrying out of experimental approaches to test pragmatic accounts. Although informal conferences took place after the 2001 workshop, proper biennial conferences on the topic of Experimental Pragmatics have been held since 2005 across Europe. The conference, now known as \\"XPrag\\", was held in the United States for the first time in July, 2015. A book entitled \\"Experimental Pragmatics: The Making of a Cognitive Science\\", by Ira Noveck, came out in October 2018. ==Research funding== Two major European grants have supported the field. The European Science Foundation's (ESF's) Research Network Program (EURO-XPRAG) sponsored European collaborations, workshops and conferences between 2009 and 2014. The German Research Foundation (DFG) established the priority program XPRAG.de in 2014. ==Further reading== *Noveck, Ira A, and Dan Sperber. Experimental Pragmatics.

He first joined the Kansas Geological Survey in 1953, initially working under the direction Raymond C. Moore to have a more accurate knowledge about the geology of the state. His fascination with the new possibilities offered by computers started ten years later while working with John W. Harbaugh at Stanford University as Visiting Research Scientist. In the following seven years, he was active organizing colloquia and as editor of the Computer Contributions, who saw 50 publications in the series by pioneers in the new field. Merriam accepted the position of Chairman of the Department of Geology at Syracuse University in 1971 and moved to the same position at Wichita State University in 1981, coming back to the Kansas Geological Survey in 1991 to retire in 1997,http://iamg.org/documents/Newsletters/NewslettersHSP/newsletter_54.pdf remaining as an Emeritus Scientist. Consistent with his interest to promote the use of computers in geology, Dan was instrumental in founding the International Association for Mathematical Geology (IAMG) in 1968, serving as its second Secretary General (1972–1976) and third President (1976–1980). In 1969, he started for the Association what is today the Mathematical Geosciences journal and in 1975 Computers & Geosciences jointly with IAMG and Pergamon Press. He received the William Christian Krumbein Medal in 1982 in appreciation for his services to the IAMG and the profession and a festschrift in 1993.

The party was launched in 2014, and formed from a number of residents groups in the area. R4U is based in the Uttlesford administrative district in Essex. The party promotes a localist agenda that seeks to give residents, towns and parishes a greater say in the future of their district. Residents for Uttlesford has elected representation at multiple levels of local government: Uttlesford District Council, and various Town and Parish Councils. These include councils for both towns in Uttlesford, Saffron Walden and Great Dunmow. ==Background== For the 2013 UK local elections, Uttlesford residents stood two of their own candidates on an Independent platform. Both were elected - John Lodge to Essex County Council and Joanna Parry to Uttlesford District Council. Following this, in 2014 the local residents groups formed their own party, Residents for Uttlesford, so that they could more easily stand a larger number of candidates across their electoral District. A number of existing councillors crossed the aisle to join the new party when it was launched. The party's model is based on that of the successful Loughton Residents Association elsewhere in Essex, i.e. local representation. The Loughton Residents Association won their first local election in 1981. Outside of Essex another district that has followed a similar model is Epsom and Ewell in Surrey. Frome residents have adopted a similar model in Somerset with their 'flatpack democracy' approach for parish councils. ==Electoral history== Residents for Uttlesford fought their first local elections in May 2015, with candidates standing for seats in both the Uttlesford District Council and the Saffron Walden Town Council. They won a majority of the seats on the town council and became the official opposition in the district council. A by- election was held on 16 February 2017 in the ward of Elsenham and Henham of the Uttlesford District Council, following the resignation of the two councillors from that ward who were members of the Liberal Democrats, a UK- wide party. R4U stood candidates for the first time in that ward and won a landslide victory, earning 60% of the votes cast. In the 2019 United Kingdom local elections, the party gained control of the entire Uttlesford District Council after winning 26 out of 39 of the available seats. They also maintained control of the Saffron Walden Town Council, winning 15 out of the 16 seats. The remaining seat was won by the Green Party, whose candidate did not defeat R4U but was elected as the seventh councillor for the seven-seat ward of Saffron Walden Shire, in which only six R4U candidates stood. In October 2019, three R4U district councillors serving in the cabinet, including two who also sat on Saffron Walden Town Council, left the party to join the Green Party. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *WeAreResidents.org *Epsom & Ewell Residents Associations *Loughton Residents Association *Independents for Frome Category:Uttlesford Category:Local government in Essex Category:Politics of Essex Category:Locally based political parties in England Category:Political parties established in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in England ","title":"Residents for Uttlesford"},{"id":"46765061","text":"Major Noel Weerakoon, CA was a Sri Lankan army officer.

It is sometimes referred to as Tantric Theravada due to its parallel with tantric traditions (although it makes no reference to tantras); or as Traditional Theravada Meditation. L.S. Cousins defines it as \\"a type of Southern Buddhism which links magical and, ritual practices to a theoretical systematisation of the Buddhist path itself\\".Cousins, L.S. (1997), \\"Aspects of Southern Esoteric Buddhism \\", in Peter Connolly and Sue Hamilton (eds.), Indian Insights: Buddhism, Brahmanism and Bhakd Papers from the Annual Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, Luzac Oriental, London: 185-207, 410. Cousins LS, 1997a ‘Buddhism’ pp.369–444 in JR Hinnells (ed.) A New Handbook of Living Religions Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, cited in Mackenzie, Rory (2007), New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke, Abingdon: Routledge, One specific kind of Southern Esoteric Buddhism is termed the Yogāvacara tradition. It is most widely practiced today in Cambodia and Laos and in the pre-modern era was a major Buddhist current in Southeast Asia. In the west, the study of Southern Esoteric Buddhism was pioneered by professor François Bizot and his colleagues at the École française d'Extrême-Orient with a particular focus on the material found at Angkor.Crosby, Kate (2000). Tantric Theravada: A Bibliographic Essay on the Writings of Francois Bizot and others on the Yogavacara-Tradition, Contemporary Buddhism 1 (2), 141-198 ==History== Dancing Apsaras (water spirits) from Preah Khan, Cambodia; an Angkorian Buddhist temple with Hindu elements. ===Possible multiple origins=== Historically, the Buddhists of Abhayagiri vihāra in Sri Lanka are known to have practiced Vajrayana and this might have had an influence on Southeast Asia through their missionary work in Java. Ari Buddhism was a form of Buddhism practiced in the Mon kingdoms of Burma which also contained Tantric elements borrowed from India and local Nat (spirit) and Nāga worship. In many of Bizot's works there is some suggestion that the Buddhism of the Mon may have influenced the later Yogāvacara tradition. It is also possible that Southeast Asian Buddhism was influenced by the practice of Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism which flourished in Southeast Asia during the time of the Khmer Empire. According to Cousins, it is also possible that Southern Esoteric Buddhism developed within the \\"orthodox\\" Mahavihara tradition of Sri Lanka, citing the 5th century Buddhist scholar Buddhaghosa's mention of secret texts (gulhagantham) as well as other textual evidence from the Pali commentaries. Cousins concludes that \\"It is quite possible that present-day Southern Esoteric Buddhism contains ideas and practices deriving from more than one of these sources. Nevertheless it is certainly premature to assume that it has its origins in unorthodox circles.\\" ===Flowering=== The Yogāvacara tradition was a mainstream Buddhist tradition in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand well into the modern era. An inscription from Northern Thailand with esoteric elements has been dated to the Sukhothai Kingdom of the 16th century. Kate Crosby notes that this attestation makes the esoteric tradition earlier than “any other living meditation tradition in the contemporary Theravada world.”Kate Crosby, Traditional Theravada Meditation and its Modern-Era Suppression Hong Kong: Buddha Dharma Centre of Hong Kong, 2013, ===Yogāvacara (18th century)=== During the reign of Rama I, the Thai Yogāvacara master Kai Thuean (1733-1823) was invited to Bangkok to be head of the meditation tradition there and was later made Sangharaja (head of the religious community) by Rama II of Siam in 1820. In Sri Lanka, a revival of Buddhist meditation in the 1750s saw a proliferation of Yogāvacara teachings and texts by Thai monks from the Ayutthaya Kingdom, one of which is the Yogāvacara's manual.Kate Crosby, Andrew Skilton, Amal Gunasena (2012), The Sutta on Understanding Death in the Transmission of Boran Meditation From Siam to the Kandyan Court, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 40 (2), 177-198. Monks of the Siam Nikaya practiced these teachings and established several monasteries around Kandy. As late as the 1970s, Yogāvacara practices such as the rapid repetition of Araham were recorded in Sri Lanka. ===Decline (19th century)=== The decline of the esoteric currents began with the rise of the reformed Buddhism in the 19th century, particularly the Dhammayuttika Nikaya established by King Rama IV (1851–1868) of the Thai Rattanakosin Kingdom in 1833, which was imported into Cambodia as it was a protectorate of the kingdom. In establishing the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, Rama IV emphasized the use of the Pali Canon as the main authority for monastic practices and also attempted to remove all superstitious and folk religious elements.Ratanakosin Period, Buddhism in Thailand, Dhammathai - Buddhist Information Network The textual tradition followed by this reform movement was that of the Sri Lankan Mahavihara school (which itself dates from a set of 12th century reforms) which took the works of the 5th century scholar Buddhagosa as representing the orthodox interpretation and thus saw other Buddhist practices as unorthodox. The reforms tightened monastic discipline and led to a decline in the practices and production of texts which were not in line with Dhammayuttika Nikaya orthodoxy. When Cambodia came under the rule of the French colonial empire, the French continued this policy of suppressing pre-reform Cambodian Buddhism. In spite of this, traditional esoteric practices survived in rural areas. ===Legacy (20th-21st century)=== Yantra tattooing by monks of Wat Bang Phra The devastation of Cambodian religion by the Khmer Rouge and religious repression in Communist Laos also had a heavy toll on these traditions. Southern Esoteric Buddhist influences may be present in the practices and views of the modern Thai Dhammakaya movementWilliams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, 327.Mettanando Bhikkhu (1999), Meditation and Healing in the Theravada Buddhist Order of Thailand and Laos, Ph.D. thesis, University of Hamburg.Mackenzie, Rory (2007), New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke, Abingdon: Routledge, as well as in certain South Asian religious practices such as the use of protective tattoos and amulets, the singing of protective Gathas (e.g. Jinapañjara Gāthā), Thai astrology and the invocation of spirits and ghosts (such as Somdej Toh and Mae Nak).McDaniel, Justin Thomas. The Lovelorn Ghost and the Magical Monk: Practicing Buddhism in Modern Thailand. Today, magicians and forest monks using these techniques are most prevalent in the banks of the Mekong in Cambodia and Laos; they are believed to have magical powers, the divine eye and the ability to communicate with spirits. They practice Kasina meditation, mantra recitation, and ascetic practices (dhutanga). Thai forest monks such as Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo were also influenced by esoteric practices as is exemplified by his text \\"The Divine Mantra.\\"Ajaan Lee (2006), The Divine Mantra ==Practices== Buddhist prayer beads used for mantra recitation. Cousins sees the practice of Southern Esoteric Buddhism as being defined by the mapping of inner and outer worlds, and calls it 'tantro-kabbalistic' mysticism. By this he means \\"a form of mysticism which utilizes a rather elaborate map of correspondences -between the human body, the cosmos and some kind of higher reality or knowledge. In the process it draws on the full resources of the widely-dispersed traditions of magic and the occult - letter, sound and number symbolism together with the use of structured patterns of shape or gesture.\\" Features of Yogāvacara practice include: *The use of encoded language *Energy centers & channels like cakra/marma & nadi *Esoteric interpretation of Buddhist words, objects, myths, numbers and the Abhidhamma Pitaka texts *The importance of initiation by a Guru (master) *The use of the symbolism of embryology *The practice of a type of meditation in which one visualizes and gives birth to a 'Buddha within' and the Dharmakāya. *Chemistry of mercury as model for ongoing process of purification *The practice of magic for healing, longevity, protection, etc. *Alchemy *Worship (puja) of Buddhas, Devas and Spirits *A path which is open to all, monastics and lay persons *Internal/external applications (Right hand- left hand) *The importance of ritual. Two of the most widely used sacred mantras in Yogāvacara texts are Namo Buddhaya (\\"Homage to the Buddha\\") and Araham (\\"Worthy One\\"). Here is an example of esoteric interpretation of the letter and number symbolism of Namo Buddhaya: *NA, symbolizes the twelve virtues of the mother; *MO, the twenty-one virtues of the father; *BU, the six virtues of the king; *DDHA., the seven virtues of the family; *YA, the ten virtues of the teacher. The recitation of these sacred phrases was used as a meditation practice. Robert Percival (in Ceylon from 1796 to 1800), described Buddhist mantra meditation thus: \\"To their girdles they wear suspended strings of beads made of a brownish or black wood; and mutter prayers as they go along.\\" In one text studied by Bizot, meditation includes the use of visualization of colored lights paired with sacred syllables located throughout the body and visions of the Buddha and a stupa at the top of mount Sumeru. Another text called the Ratanamala uses the itipi so formula for various purposes including spiritual protection, magical 'worldly' uses which are termed \\"left-hand\\", the transformation of the body into a kayasiddhi, a spiritual body, as well as for the pursuit of nirvana (termed \\"right-hand path\\"). Several studies by Bizot have also looked at certain \\"rebirthing\\" rituals which seem to have been common in pre-modern Cambodia. They included symbolic sacred syllables, the entrance into a cave which symbolized the womb, meditation on embryonic development, and the belief that this meditation would allow one's body to be reborn as the Dharmakaya. Another practice studied by Bizot was the use of yantras or sacred diagrams, which were made with Pali words and phrases and used as tattoos and on clothing. A Burmese statue of Bo Min Gaung, a famous weikza (wizard) In his study of the Saddavimala, a Yogāvacara text which was widely circulated in Southeast Asia (with over two hundred extant manuscripts), Bizot gives an outline of Yogāvacara practice: \\"The yogavacara must: # memorise the stages of the embryonic development (with their alphabetic equivalents) which form the stages of his own formation; # through these stages build himself another body using the organs and constituents that are the letters, i.e. the portions of the Dhamma; # become conscious that this new body which he is going to produce outside of himself, first takes form within him, in his stomach at the level of the navel, taking the form of a Buddha the height of a thumb; # pursue and achieve in this life the construction of this immortal vehicle because it leads the person who possesses it to Nibbana, in that it takes the place of the spent physical form at the moment of death.\\" In contemporary Southern Buddhism, these practices are sometimes termed Boran Kammatthana (ancient practices) and are most widely seen in Cambodian Buddhism. They usually involve \\"the physical internalisation or manifestation of aspects of the Theravada path by incorporating them at points in the body between the nostril and navel.\\"Kate Crosby, Andrew Skilton, Amal Gunasena; The Sutta on Understanding Death in the Transmission of Boran Meditation From Siam to the Kandyan Court. The practices of the Burmese Buddhist Weizza (\\"Wizards\\") who follow an esoteric system of occult practices (such as recitation of spells, samatha and alchemy) which are believed to lead to supernormal powers and a life of immortality might also be related to Southern Esoteric Buddhism. ==See also== *Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism *Buddhism in Cambodia *Buddhism in Thailand *Tantra *Vajrayana ==ReferencesSources== *Mettanando Bhikkhu (1999), Meditation and Healing in the Theravada Buddhist Order of Thailand and Laos, Hamburg (Ph.D. thesis). *Woodward, EL.

Rebels in the small town of Villa de Los Santos made the first declaration for independence and the movement quickly spread to the capital. Fearing that Spain would retake the country, the rebels quickly joined the Republic of Gran Colombia. ==History== Initial attempts to free Panama from Spain came from South American liberators, not Panamanians, who saw Panama as a strategic link, both politically and militarily between South America and the Central American states. As early as 1787, Venezuelan Francisco de Miranda attempted to interest the British in a canal project in Panama to increase trade for Britain, in exchange for military support to bolster South American independence hopes. The attack by Napoleon, who deposed the Spanish monarch in 1807, led to the push for independence throughout South America by Simón Bolivar. Though Bolivar did not set foot in Panama, he advocated for independence, declaring in his 1815 \\"Letter from Jamaica\\" that the independence of Panama would lead to commerce opportunities. In 1819 the Scotsman Gregor MacGregor led a failed attempt to free Panama. When South American revolutionary zeal deposed Viceroyalty of New Granada Juan de la Cruz Mourgeón, he fled to Panama and was declared governor. Mourgeón was ordered to Ecuador to fight the separatists and appointed José de Fábrega as his successor. As soon as Mourgeón sailed, Fábrega seized the moment for Panama's independence. On 10 November 1821, the first call for independence was made in the small provincial town of Villa de los Santos. Called the \\"Primer Grito de Independencia de la Villa de Los Santos\\" (Shout for Independence), it ignited rebels throughout the Panamanian countryside. Using bribes to quell resistance from the Spanish troops and garner their desertion, the rebels gained control of Panama City without bloodshed. On November 20, 1821, Fábrega proclaimed Panamanian independence in Panama City. An open meeting was held with merchants, landowners, and elites, who fearing retaliation from Spain and interruption of trade decided to join the Republic of Gran Colombia and drafted the Independence Act of Panama. == References == Category:History of Panama Category:Independence of Panama Category:1821 in Central America Category:Panama–Spain relations ","title":"Independence of Panama from Spain"},{"id":"46765345","text":"At the end of each regular season, the Southern Conference names major award winners in baseball.

Originally from the Pacific Ocean, it has been introduced into the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, where it is considered invasive on European coasts. It exists in two phases which, at one time, were thought to be different species; a medium-sized feathery form attached to other seaweeds, and a small tufted form known as Trailliella. ==Description== This algal species exists in two phases. The gametangial phase is always epiphytic, growing on Cystoseira and other algae. It forms erect, brownish-red, feathery fronds and grows to a length of up to . The fronds are flattened and bear crozier-shaped hooks which cling on to and get tangled with the host seaweed. The tetrasporangial phase forms much-branched, brownish-red tufts of fine filaments growing in small clumps with a width of and resembling cotton wool. They are epiphytic on coralline algae or occasionally grow direct on rock or other hard substrate. The red colour of this species comes from the presence of the pigments phycoerythrin and phycocyanin which mask the chlorophyll a, beta-Carotene and various xanthophylls which are also present. ==Distribution== B. hamifera is native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean and the coasts around Japan. It was introduced into the northeastern Atlantic Ocean in the late nineteenth century, possibly arriving on the hull of a ship or among shellfish. It is now present from Iceland and northern Norway southward to Portugal, as well as in the Canary Islands, Algeria, Tunisia and the Adriatic Sea. It was first noticed in Britain, on the coast of Dorset in 1890, when the form \\"Trailliella\\" was collected. The first record in Ireland was in A. D. Cotton's 1915 survey of the marine algae of Clare Island, County Mayo.A. D. Cotton, 'Part 15. Marine Algae', Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature, Vol. 31, A Biological Survey of Clare Island in the County of Mayo, Ireland and of the Adjoining District (Sections 1-3) (1911 - 1915), pp. 15.1-15.178 The first record in Northern Ireland was in 1972 from Sandeel Bay.Morton, O. 1994. Marine Algae of Northern Ireland. Ulster Museum. Belfast. It grows in the low intertidal zone and to depths of about and can be abundant in lagoon-like areas on the lower shore. ==Life cycle== This seaweed displays a complex life cycle with an alternation of generations between the gametophytes and the tetrasporophytes. In the spring, gametophytes occur. The sperm produced is not motile and relies on currents to bring it to the female reproductive structures. Fertilisation results in the production of carposporophytes, which in turn produce carpospores which develop into the original tetrasporophytes. The tetrasporophyte occurs throughout the year, but is most common between October and March. It was at one time thought to be a different species and was given the name Trailliella intricata. Vegetative reproduction is uncommon, but asexual reproduction occurs as a result of fragmentation of the thallus. ==References== Category:Bonnemaisoniales Category:Plants described in 1891 ","title":"Bonnemaisonia hamifera"},{"id":"46765410","text":"2014–15 Season Play-off for the 2014–15 Hong Kong football season is the 3rd season of the tournament.

Thereafter, she was twice elected to the District 5 seat on the Jefferson Parish Council. == Career == Heebe is a former television reporter in Monroe in Ouachita Parish in northeast Louisiana and a former tourism director for Jefferson Parish. On March 27, 1999, Heebe was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in a special election to replace David Vitter, who had been elected to the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 1st congressional district following the resignation of Republican Bob Livingston. Sneed, as she was then known, led a 14-candidate field with 1,619 votes (16.8 percent). She was then placed into a runoff contest with fellow Republican Ben Slater, who polled 1,405 votes (14.5 percent). In third place was another Republican, Eric Skrmetta, subsequently an elected member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission. In the second round of balloting, Sneed prevailed, 6,670 (52.6 percent) to Slater's 6,021 (47.4 percent). Sneed was unopposed for a full term in the House in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 23, 1999. On October 4, 2003, Sneed was elected to the Jefferson Parish Council with 19,925 votes (81.4 percent). She was reelected in 2007 without opposition but vacated the post in August 2008; at the time she was the only woman on the council and only the second woman ever to have been a member of the body. Heebe was known for fast constituent service while she served on the council. Carey Hammett, a beautification activist whom Heebe appointed to the Jefferson Parish Board of Zoning Adjustments, said, \\"I cannot imagine not having her in public service in Jefferson. I'm heart-broken, because she's good.\\" Heebe left the council before her husband negotiated an agreement to close the parish dump and send the residential garbage to Heebe's company, River Birch, Inc., in Waggaman. The agreement failed, and Jefferson Parish sued Heebe. A federal criminal investigation followed. In 2012, an ethics complaint was filed against Jennifer Heebe regarding her failure to submit reports of campaign spending prior to July 2008. Heebe was succeeded in the House by fellow Republican John LaBruzzo. Oddly, LaBruzzo had considered running to finish Heebe's council term. Instead, he sought a third term in the House and was unseated through redistricting in the 2011 primary. Heebe was succeeded on the council by the third woman to serve on the body, Cynthia Lee- Shung, a daughter of the late Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee. Lee-Shung retained Heebe's aide, Ron Hinyub, in her employ. == Personal life == She is married to Frederick Riley Heebe (born December 1952), a prominent real estate developer who is also engaged in the landfill business. Her father-in-law was Frederick Jacob Reagan Heebe, a Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, who was first appointed in 1966. Jennifer Heebe resigned at the beginning of her second term on the Jefferson Parish Council in 2008, when she and her husband purchased a mansion on St. Charles Avenue in the Uptown section of New Orleans. She added that the demands of rearing their twin daughters, Sarah and Anna, made it unlikely that she would ever return to the political arena. Heebe is a cancer survivor. ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Journalists from Louisiana Category:People from Monroe, Louisiana Category:Politicians from New Orleans Category:People from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:Women state legislators in Louisiana Category:Parish jurors and commissioners in Louisiana Category:Cancer survivors Category:American women television journalists ","title":"Jennifer Sneed Heebe"},{"id":"46765480","text":"Matiltan Hydropower Project is a proposed run-of-the-river hydro-power generation project which is located in the Gorkin Matiltan region of Kalam valley, District Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, on the left tributary of Suvastu River.

The program enjoyed early success under its first coach Tracey Leone. The team tied for second place in the Atlantic Coast Conference during this period and made the NCAA tournament in every year. The Tigers also reached the ACC tournament final twice during this period. The team's best finish was a quarterfinals appearance in 1998. In 1999, Tracey Leone was replaced as head coach by Ray Leone. ===2000s=== The team's good fortunes continued in the 2000s finishing no lower than 3rd in the ACC in the first four seasons. Ray Leone left as Head Coach in 2000 and was replaced by Todd Bramble. The team could not quite match the success of the early 2000s, never finishing above 4th in the ACC between 2004 and 2010. The Tigers continued to make the NCAA tournament. They made the tournament every season under Bramble. Their best result was the Quarterfinals in 2008. In 2008, Bramble left as coach and was replaced with Hershey Strosberg. The team took a sharp decline under Strosberg, finishing 10th or below in the ACC in each of his three seasons in charge. The team failed to make the NCAA tournament in those three years, ending a streak of 14 consecutive appearances. ===2010s=== Strosberg was fired in 2010 and replaced with Eddie Radwanski. Radwanski's teams improved in each of their first three seasons but could not finish above 10th in the ACC and failed to make the NCAA tournament. A six win improvement from 2013 to 2014 saw the Tigers finish 5th in the ACC and return to the NCAA tournament. The Tigers have made the NCAA tournament during the next two seasons and recorded double digit wins from 2014–2019. The team advanced farther in each NCAA tournament appearance during 2014–16, including a Sweet 16 trip in 2016, their first trip to the Sweet 16 since 2001. The Tigers could not repeat the feat in the last three years of the decade, making the Second Round twice (2017 and 2019), but falling there in each year. Hazing Lawsuit In 2014 a lawsuit was brought against Clemson University, Clemson University administrators, 3 women's soccer team coaches, and 16 women's soccer team players by Haley Hunt. Hunt was a member of the team from 2011–2013. The lawsuit claims that Hunt was subjected to hazing during her time with the team and the hazing caused significant physical harm. As of 2016, Hunt has settled with all but one of the defendants named in the case. ==Seasons== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\\" !rowspan=3 Season !rowspan=3 Head coach !colspan=7 Season result !colspan=2 Tournament results - !colspan=3 Overall !colspan=4 Conference !rowspan=2 Conference !rowspan=2 NCAA - !
