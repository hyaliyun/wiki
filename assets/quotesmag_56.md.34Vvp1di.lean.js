Delgado and starring Cantinflas, √Ångel Garasa, Lupita Ferrer and Susana Salvat. The title is a pun on the title of the novel Don Quixote of La Mancha.Mart√≠nez Soria & Mill√°n Mart√≠nez, p. 119 Plot Justo Leal y Aventado (Cantinflas) is a law intern who receives classes from an old lawyer, Professor Ram√≥n Arvide (√Ångel Garasa), already retired, who lists the many ways Justo reminds him of the title character of Don Quijote, saying \\"You are a supporter of justice; you like to help the poor, even knowing how little, or nothing, they can give you. Anyway ... you are a pure man, and without spot.\\" Justo works as a law intern in the prestigious law firm of the Manceras, lawyers whose clientele is usually the elite. Just does not like the job, although he has a friend there in the secretary, Ang√©lica (Lupita Ferrer). Justo asks for an increase in his salary, but he is never granted it. This, combined with the disgust he experiences in having to serve corrupt clients, leads Justo to resign, to devote himself to the defense of those who do not have with what to pay. During the course of the film, Justo defends a series of clients. He releases Cirilo Pingarr√≥n, a young man who is accused of stealing a television from the store where he works, from prison. Although Cirilo is actually guilty of the theft, Justo argues that he only wanted to take it to his home \\"to check how portable this portable television is\\" and \\"to be able to see, like any human being, that great match between Am√©rica and Guadalajara,\\" and that his intention was to return it the next day. Justo also calls attention to the fact that the store owner (a Spaniard whose accent is almost incomprehensible) pays Isidro only forty pesos a week, which he argues is far from being what establishes the law. In another case, Justo also helps Sara Buenrostro (Susana Salvat), a young widow who wants to take her daughter away because she works as a nightclub dancer. He points out the hypocrisy of the accusers, indicating that the accusing lawyer (one of the Manceras with whom Justo had previously worked) has been seen sunbathing with a colleague's secretary. The shame, combined with the fact that Justo had gotten Mrs. Buenrostro another job as a telephone operator, causes the demand to be withdrawn, and the young mother keeps her daughter. The neighborhood in which Justo lives, meanwhile, is under threat of the owner throwing out the tenants in order to raise rents. Justo takes their defense, and in a meeting called with the owner, Justo (taking advantage that he had bought a phone that had not yet been connected) pretends to have a telephone conversation with the Undersecretary of Health, including making the owner believe of a new law that would punish the lack of maintenance of homes with jail. Feeling threatened by the new law, and following the advice of Justo, the businessman not only decides not to throw out the tenants, but to make several fix-ups in the houses. The same judge who presided over the case of Mrs. Buenrostro asks Justo to go find his son, who has left the home to devote himself to the hippie lifestyle. Justo dresses as a hippie to enter a club frequented by hippies where he finds the young man, and while trying to convince him to return home, the club is raided by the police and take everyone to jail, including Justo, whom they see as another of the hippies. Justo berates the young people in jail, criticizing their lack of love for work, telling them \\"you want to be free, yet you are becoming slaves of your own vices.\\" Professor Arvide hears the news that Justo has been taken to jail, and runs to the police station to take him out, but leaves in such a hurry that he forgets to change his clothes and arrives dressed in pajamas, so the police take him for another hippie and put him in jail with Justo. After spending the night in jail, Justo, the professor, and the judge's son are released. The young man, repentant, promises Justo that his hippie days are over and returns home. The neighbors celebrate the salvation of the neighborhood (and Justo's birthday) with a party. He is just about to declare his love for Ang√©lica, when she announces that she and the businessman's son are engaged. During the party, Professor Arvide, while dancing with Ang√©lica, suffers an attack; Justo accompanies him to his apartment, where the professor, after giving some final advice to Justo, dies. In the last scene, a few days after the professor's death, many of the characters Justo has been able to help come to his home/office to thank him for his service. The film ends with Justo walking through the streets of Mexico City.

Pilcher stated that the film was the second time where Cantiflas \\"denounced the local counterculture\\" by showing his character \\"in a nightclub filled with drugged- out beats\\" (after El se√±or doctor), stating in regards of the scene where his character berates a group of hippies in jail that \\"in berating the jipitecas for smoking dope instead of working, Moreno reversed the roles of his early movie, Ah√≠ est√° el detalle, conceding to them the carefree younthful spirit of Cantinflas while he became the stodgy establishment figure played by Joaqu√≠n Pardav√© [in Ah√≠ est√° el detalle].\\" The film premiered two weeks before the first anniversary of the Tlatelolco massacre, which is not specifically mentioned in the film. Nonetheless, Pilcher argued that Cantinflas's denouncements against the counterculture among the youth were \\"Mario Moreno [joining in] the attempt to restore the legitimacy of the ruling party [the Institutional Revolutionary Party] by condemning the students as a threat to the nation.\\"Pilcher, p. 200 Pilcher also cited the film as an example of Cantinflas's career at the time having \\"reached a terminal decline\\", describing the courtroom scene as him having \\"tried to relive the triumphant courtroom scene from Ah√≠ est√° el detalle; but where in 1940 Cantinflas had subverted the entire courtroom with his fast-talking nonsense, the best he could manage in 1969 was to accuse the prosecutor of vacationing in Acapulco with a bilingual secretary.\\" Pilcher further noted \\"attempts to restore his youthful complexion\\", saying, \\"Most pathetic of all was his desire to have his youthful cake and eat it too by disguising himself in a mop-top wig and wire- rimmed glasses to dance with a go-go girl before lecturing the jipitecas. He appeared, in the end, like an ambivalent old parson, simultaneously seduced by the sins of youth and terrified for his immortal soul. While venting his wrath on middle-class youth, he also lost touch with the changing reality of the urban poor, always his most loyal audience.\\"Pilcher, p. 201 References Bibliography *Mart√≠nez Soria, Carlos Juli√°n; Mill√°n Mart√≠nez, Juan Manuel.

The ship was built in Baltimore. It was on return from trading in China with a load of porcelain and perhaps opium when it sank. The opium-trading brig Frolic wrecked on a reef north of Point Cabrillo, a few miles from what is now Mendocino in 1850; the investigation of the wreck by agents of Henry Meiggs led to the discovery of the coast redwood forests of the Mendocino area and the beginning of the timber trade that would drive the local economy for decades...

Now offices. Long ashlar front in Perpendicular Gothic style, with elaborate central tower, many steeply pitched gables, and many outsize octagonal pinnacles. Projecting cross-wings with traceried windows, housing the chapel (l) and refectory (r), the domestic intermediate parts two-storied. Elizabeth Gascoigne (9 September 1812 ‚Äì 23 February 1893) was the heiress to the Gascoigne estate, eventually becoming the main owner of Lotherton Hall in Leeds which is now owned by Leeds City Council (since 1968) as part of the Leeds Museums and Galleries. She was a woman of many talents, dabbling in writing books, designing stained glass windows, playing the harp and being a charitable contributor to the community of Leeds, mainly Aberford in Yorkshire and Ashtown in Ireland. Her works in stained glass have been displayed in exhibitions, and many of the buildings her and her sister commissioned are still part of the communities that they lived in.  Family  Elizabeth Gascoigne was born on 9 September 1812. She was the daughter of Richard Oliver Gascoigne and Mary Turner. She was one of four children. Elizabeth Gascoigne had one older sister named Mary Isabella, and two younger brothers named Richard and Thomas Gascoigne. In her childhood Elizabeth, like her sister, was taught how to read, write and be a genteel Victorian woman, with the intention of being matriarch of the household and a supportive wife. In 1842 tragedy struck the family, as both of the young Gascoigne brothers died, leaving Mary Isabella and Elizabeth Gascoigne as the sole heirs to the Gascoigne estates. In 1843 tragedy struck the family again when her father Richard Gascoigne died, leaving the Gascoigne estates to Mary and Elizabeth. Parlington Hall, which was the family home, was given to the elder of the sisters, Mary, and Lotherton Hall given to Elizabeth. Both women were to inherit and move into the properties once they had married.  Life  Elizabeth and her sister were very active in their community, rebuilding a church at Garforth and homes in the local area. They were thought to be very charitable. In 1844 the Gascoigne sisters commissioned the building of almshouses on the old Great North Road (A1) to commemorate the memory of their father and two brothers. The homes were built for four people, two men and two women, retired tenants of the Gascoigne estate. The building featured stained- glass windows believed to have been designed by the sisters, which were featured in an exhibition in 2004 at Lotherton Hall. Additionally, during the Great Famine of 1846‚Äì1847 they travelled to Ireland to help out the workers of Castle Oliver, an estate owned by their father.http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/20459/1/C.%20Bovis%2C%20The%20Gascoigne%20Family%20%28PhD%2C%202017%29.pdf On 10 February 1852 Elizabeth married Fredrick Mason Trench, 2nd Baron Ashtown, in Aberford, Leeds, thereby becoming a baroness. He had five children, two daughters and three sons from a prior marriage, making Elizabeth a stepmother. Lord Ashtown was cousin to Fredrick Charles Trench of Dublin, who married Mary Isabella Gascoigne, Elizabeth‚Äôs sister. Elizabeth split her time living between Ashtown in Ireland and Lotherton Hall. On 23 February 1893 Elizabeth died, aged 80, in Montreux, Switzerland, and was buried on 25 February in Territet, Switzerland. She and Lord Ashtown did not have any children of their own, meaning there was no heir to Lotherton Hall; instead her nephew Colonel Frederick Richard Thomas Trench-Gascoigne inherited Lotherton Hall.  Legacy  Elizabeth Gascoigne‚Äôs legacy lives on in Lotherton Hall where there is a portrait of her, another with her sister, and one portrait of all four siblings. She also has a portrait in the National Library of Ireland. In addition to this the almshouses which she and her sister built to commemorate their father and brothers' memory still stand today and are used as offices.

Early life Bowring was born in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, England, to Margaret Grace Brook (1917-1999) and Edgar Rennie Harvey Bowring (1915-2001), a solicitor and insurance professional. His 3rd great-grandfather Nathaniel's brother's grandson was Sir John Bowring, an early governor of Hong Kong. Bowring received a Catholic school education culminating in a time at Ampleforth College, Yorkshire. He studied history at Cambridge, graduating 1963. Under a Goldsmiths Company scholarship, he then studied as a research student at the University of Khartoum, Sudan, for a year. Bowring returned to the UK and began a career in journalism which culminated in two years at the Investors Chronicle where he developed a taste for investigative financial reporting. Asia Bowring's first step towards Asia was in 1972, to take up an opportunity with an about-to-be-launched Sydney business magazine Finance Week, what turned out to be a short-lived Financial Times-News Ltd partnership. The next year, he accepted an offer to move to Hong Kong to become business editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review and part-time correspondent for the Financial Times. Bowring's first stint at the Review lasted five years, ending in conflict with its editor Derek Davies, after which he passed the next two years at the Asian Wall Street Journal, briefly, and the Financial Times. He returned to his Review career in 1980 as deputy editor at Davies' invitation and rose to editor in 1988, the role he held until 1992. For the next 19 years, Bowring wrote regular columns for the International Herald Tribune, and also for the South China Morning Post from 1995 to 2017. He co-founded the Asia Sentinel news website in 2006. Lee Kuan Yew In 2010, former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, together with his son Lee Hsien Loong, and Goh Chok Tong, threatened legal action against The New York Times Company, which owned the International Herald Tribune, regarding an Op-Ed piece titled \\"All in the Family\\" of 15 February 2010 by Bowring, then a freelance columnist for the newspaper.All in the Family, Khaleej Times, February 17, 2010 After an apology by the newspaper that readers of the article might have \\"infer[red] that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit\\", the New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee Hsien Loong, S$50,000 to Lee and S$50,000 to Lee Hsien Loong and Goh Chok Tong, in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to \\"dynastic politics\\" in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that 1994 settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew. In response, media-rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders wrote an open letter to urge Lee and other top officials of the Singapore government to stop taking \\"libel actions\\" against journalists. Bowring passed over without comment the accession of Lee Jr in the long and detailed obituary to Lee he wrote for The Guardian.

It has now been converted into a distant cooling facility by Hofor. History The Western Power Station photographed by Fritz Theodor Benzen in 1903 The first power station in Copenhagen was built by K√∏benhavns Belysningsv√¶sen in 1892 at Gothersgade. In 1896, it was decided to build a new power station at Tietgensgade (then Ny Vestergades Forl√¶ngelse). It was inaugurated on 7 September 1898. It was expanded several times over the next few years to be able to supply electricity for Copenhagen Tramways. From 1908, it also served as a substation under the new Eastern Power Station on √òster All√© in √òsterbro. The substation was expanded in 1912. In 1921, the power plant was discontinued. The substation was again expanded in the period until 1036. The two existing 30/6 kV transformers were supplemented by a third transformer in 194 and a fourth transformer was added in i 1957.

History  Four days after the people of Milan had driven the Austrian Imperial Army out of the city during the Five Days of Milan, the Provisional Government of Milan raised two cavalry regiments: Lombard Chevau-l√©gers Regiment () and the Lombard Dragoons Regiment (). On 5 September of the same year both regiments were integrated in the Royal Sardinian Army of the Kingdom of Sardinia to fight in the First Italian War of Independence. On 15 March 1849 the two regiments were merged as 7th Regiment of Cavalry and on 3 January 1850 the regiment was renamed Regiment Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo (. During the Crimean War the regiment's 1st Squadron distinguished itself at the Battle of the Chernaya. During the Second Italian War of Independence the regiment fought at San Martino and during the Third Italian War of Independence at Battle of Custoza (1866). During World War I the regiment earned a Silver Medal of Military Valour during the Battle of Istrago. During World War II the regiment was part of the 1st Fast Division \\"Eugenio di Savoia\\" and served in occupied Yugoslavia, where it dissolved around 8 September 1943 after Italy had changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile. On 16 September 1964 the Italian Army split the Regiment \\"Lancieri di Aosta\\" (6th) in two reconnaissance squadron groups, with the II Squadrons Group in Reggio Emilia receiving the name Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\". The group moved to Gradisca d'Isonzo in Friuli Venezia Giulia to join the Infantry Division \\"Folgore\\" as the division's reconnaissance unit. During the 1975 army reform the Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\" received the number, war flag, and traditions of the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\" (12th) and moved to the city of Gorizia. Equipped with Fiat Campagnola reconnaissance vehicles and M47 Patton tanks the squadrons group continued in the role of the Folgore's divisional reconnaissance unit. When the Italian Army disbanded the divisional level in 1986 the \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\" squadrons group was equipped with VCC-2 armoured personnel carriers and renamed 12th Mechanized Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\\". The squadrons group then joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Vittorio Veneto\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and the Vittorio Veneto was one of the first brigades to disband. On 31 January 1991 the Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo were disbanded and its war flag transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

Today the regiment is the reconnaissance unit of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". History  The regiment was raised on 16 September 1859. It earned its first of three Silver Medals of Military Valour at the Battle of Bu Meliana during the Italo-Turkish War, and the second two years later, when the regiment charged Libyan rebels at Monterus Nero. During World War I the regiment initially served on the Italian Front before being sent to Macedonian front in 1916. In July 1918 the regiment was sent to the Western Front in France and fought at Reims, Chemin des Dames, Sissonne, and on the Meuse. After the war the regiment was disbanded on 20 May 1920. On 15 February 1942 a reconnaissance group was raised in Pinerolo, which received the name \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\". On 20 November 1942 the group arrived in Tunisia to fight in the Tunisian campaign, where it distinguished itself at Gab√®s during the Battle of Wadi Akarit and Enfidha during Operation Strike, earning its third Silver Medal of Military Valour. The group surrendered with the rest of Army Group Africa on 13 May 1943. On 1 January 1952 the company-sized \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" Armored Cavalry Squadron was raised in Verona and equipped with M8 Greyhounds to serve as the reconnaissance unit of the Armored Division \\"Centauro\\". In 1956 the Cavalleggeri di Lodi were expanded to squadrons group and moved to Lenta in Piedmont. During the 1975 army reform the Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" received the number, war flag, and traditions of the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" (15th). Equipped with Fiat Campagnola reconnaissance vehicles and M47 Patton tanks the squadrons group continued in the role of the Cenatauro's divisional reconnaissance unit. When the Italian Army disbanded the divisional level in 1986 the \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" squadrons group was equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks and renamed 15th Tank Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\". The squadrons group then joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Brescia\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and the Brescia was one of the first brigades to disband. On 27 July 1991 the brigade was deactivated along with most of its subordinate units and the Cavalleggeri di Lodi joined the 3rd Army Corps. On 6 September of the same year the squadrons group was renamed as Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" (15th) without changing size. Around the same time the regiment began to replace its tracked Leopard 1A2 tanks with wheeled Centauro tank destroyers. On 31 October 1995 the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" (15th) was disbanded and its war flag was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.  2020 reform  On 10 January 2020 the 31st Tank Regiment of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\" was reformed as a reconnaissance unit and given the name, flag and traditions of the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" (15th).  Current structure  As of 2020 the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" (15th) consists of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Lecce ** Command and Logistic Support Squadron ** 1st Reconnaissance Squadrons Group *** 1st Reconnaissance Squadron *** 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron *** 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron *** Heavy Armor Squadron The Command and Logistic Support Squadron fields the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon. The three reconnaissance squadrons are equipped with VTLM Lince vehicles and Centauro tank destroyers, the latter of which are scheduled to be replaced by Freccia reconnaissance vehicles. The Heavy Armor Squadron is equipped with Centauro tank destroyers, which are being replaced by Centauro II tank destroyers. With the introduction of the Freccia reconnaissance vehicles the reconnaissance squadrons will be reduced from three to two.

Parks (April 18, 1860 ‚Äì June 21, 1937) was an American politician and businessman who served as the state auditor for Colorado from 1894 to 1896 and as mayor of Glenwood Springs multiple times. Life In 1887, he was appointed by President Harrison as the receiver of the land office in Glenwood Springs which Parks would hold until 1891. In 1894, he was given the Republican nomination for state auditor at the state convention with 558 votes against E. L. Price's 394. During Colorado's gubernatorial election in 1912, Parks ran for the Republican nomination and he supported allowing attorney Philip B. Stewart to petition his way onto the Republican primary ballot where Parks would narrowly defeat him. Due to the division of the Republican vote between Clifford and Progressive nominee Edward P. Costigan the Democrats were able to easily win the election with Elias M. Ammons defeating both candidates with over 40% of the vote, but the Republicans attempted to have Clifford placement in the popular vote increased to second only due to the second placing party having the choice of judges and officers of elections for the 1914 gubernatorial election. Parks was later elected as Colorado State University regent in 1914. In 1925, he was elected to the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

History  The Kingston Chronicle and Gazette began on June 1833, when James Macfarlane amended the title from as it was when he purchased the paper from John Alexander Macauley and Alexander John Pringle. For more information on the previous proprietors, please see The Kingston Chronicle. The change in name, although likely made for a myriad of reasons, is addressed by Macfarlane in the June 29th, 1833 issue: Macfarlane was born in Scotland, came to Kingston soon after the War of 1812, and spent time in Oswego, New York where he married Isura Carrington in April of 1834. July 1st of 1824 he purchased the Chronicle from Macauley and Pringle, five years after their acquisition of it. Four years later Macfarlane started the Brockville Gazette, but diversified his attention to community and business matters rather than its running, selling the paper a year later. Macfarlane was a Justice of the Peace in 1834, a local agent for insurance as well as the Encyclopedia Americana, printed The statutes of the province of Upper Canada‚Ä¶., imported garden supplies, and sat on the Board of Health and Court of Requests. While championing the Chronicle, he frequently gave his time and effort to promote groups such as the Dorcas Society, the Female Benevolent Society, the Celtic Sons of Upper Canada and the St Andrew‚Äôs Society. Macfarlane took on F. M. Hill as a partner in 1832, Hill continuing for two more years before withdrawing from paper. Francis Manning Hill (1809 - 1854) was mayor of Kingston in 1849 and 1851, and his home Hillcroft was later used by Alexander Campbell, a father of Confederation. Hill was married to Mary Briggs at Belleville in June of 1833. He was connected to the Kingston Mechanics' Institute, Kingston Gas Light Company, and Board of Trade. He also acted as Town Clerk and was proprietor of the hardware business Hill & Briggs. Hill and Edward John Barker of the Whig would butt heads over accusations of slander, the former referring to him as ‚ÄúYankee Hill‚Äù. Macfarlane owned and edited the Chronicle until his death on July 29th, 1847. Sometime in 1847, the paper merged with the Kingston News to form the Chronicle and News under Samuel Rowland, which would eventually be merged with the Kingston Times to form the News and Times, which would later be rebranded the Standard and merged with the British Whig.

It is situated at the east end of Zopkios Ridge, immediately west of the Falls Lake exit at Coquihalla Summit, and east of Yak Peak. Due to its close proximity to the Coquihalla Highway, the mountain attracts skiers to its slopes in winter. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Coquihalla River. The mountain was named for the thar, a Himalayan animal, and part of the ungulate names theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of Vancouver. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Thar Peak from Coquihalla Highway Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Thar Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Thar Peak. Climbing Routes Established climbing routes on Thar Peak: * East Ridge - Off-trail hiking, easy scrambling * South Slope - Off-trail hiking * Northeast Face - , First ascent 1998 * North Couloir - steep snow, First ascent 2005 See also * List of mountains of Canada * Geography of the North Cascades * Geology of British Columbia References External links * Weather: Thar Peak * Thar Peak: YouTube Category:Mountains of British Columbia Category:Canadian Cascades Category:Cascade Range Category:North Cascades ","title":"Thar Peak"},{"id":"62389021","text":"The Oushan X7 is a 5-seater compact crossover produced by Changan Automobile under the Oushan brand (known as Oshan in some marketshttp://chinaautoweb.com/2020/08/changan-oshan-launches-first-all- electric-model-the-x7-ev/).

History  The News is believed to have started in 1839, and is listed as having united with the Kingston Chronicle & Gazette to become the Chronicle and News in 1847. The earliest known proprietor was Samuel Rowland in 1851-1852, who had purchased the Chronicle and Gazette after owner James Macfarlane‚Äôs death. Samuel was a clerk for the courts in Kingston, having come to the town from Cobourg where he married his wife Mary Dudden in 1841. Their ownership continued until 1871, when the Shannon brothers were in control, with sibling James editing the paper. His tack and tone gave way to the paper becoming known as the standard bearer for the political Conservatives in Kingston. The paper was published from Princess Street during the Shannon tenure. One source cites the Shannon family at the paper consisting of older brother Alfred as printer, youngest brother Albert as a reporter, James as editor, and Lewis William as publisher/editor. The Whig-Standard recounted a story of William Shannon‚Äôs misdeeds as deputy postmaster, stating James as the publisher of the two editions. The Shannon brothers were born in County Londonderry, Ireland in the 1820s. James and William arrived in 1857, clerking at Sir John A. Macdonald‚Äôs law office. James used the paper to post numerous notices, offering investment opportunities, selling stocks and real estate. He also was a member of the Cataraqui Lodge. Lewis was also involved in stocks, as a ‚ÄúCommission Broker of Stocks, Grain and Cotton‚Äù from an office at 79 Clarence Street. At some point, the News is purchased by Andy Moore and C. John Oram, then run by Oram and T. J. Shanks, the latter a managing editor for the News for a decade. The pair also later brought in Thomas Carter of the Whig. Carter is listed in the Whig in 1893, which points to this period taking place after the Shannon family ownership. The Evening Times, a paper started in 1898 by Rev. James R. Black from the Pappas building, merged with the Times in 1903 to create the News and Times. It was meant as a competitor to the Whig‚Äôs daily, with two more pages to their six, and a dollar cheaper a year compared to their price of $6. On April 8th, 1908 the News was taken over by a local syndicate of Conservatives made up of William R. Givens (a one-time News reporter), H. W. Richardson and W. F. Nickle. They formed the Standard Publishing Company Limited and Givens rebranded the paper as the News-Standard to honour its history as a standard bearer for the Tories, with W. Rupert Davies as the publisher. Prior to Givens, the News and Times had been owned by F. W. Wiggins of the Ottawa Free Press, and then by S. M. Newton. Davies had been a publisher and editor at the Herald in Thamesville, the Renfrew Mercury, and was elected to the directorate of the Canadian Press in 1929, becoming president in 1939 through 1941. The daily Standard was achieving a net paid circulation of 7,200 in 1923, and a few years later was merged with the British Whig to create the Whig-Standard in 1925/1926.

On 20 February 2020, the first song \\"Boota Gaalan Kad Da Ae\\" from the film's soundtrack, sung by Amrinder Gill and Gurshabad was released. The official trailer of the film was released on 23 February 2020. The trailer crossed the million views within eight hours, and 2.7 million views on YouTube within twenty-four hours of its release. On 1 March 2020, the second song \\"Majboori\\" from the film, sung by Gurshabad was released. On 11 March 2020, the promotional duet track \\"Majhe Wal Da\\", sung by Gill and Nimrat Khaira is releasing. Also, the song \\"Baddlan De Kaalje\\" was released in the prequel, which was sung by the same duo. On 12 March 2020, the title track of the film sung by Gill and Gurshabad was released. The film was released on 13 March 2020 but was pulled out of theaters because of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India. In May, it was announced that the film will be re-released once the lockdown will be over. The film was re-released in Dubai on 27 May 2020. When Karaj Gill was asked about releasing the film digitally, he denied and said, \\"The kind of money OTT platforms offer to regional cinema is not enough to recover the costs. Low- budget films might be able to break even through this, but not us.\\"  Reception   Box office  In India, the film opened at better occupancy than the Bollywood release Angrezi Medium, which was released on same day. The film collected 80-90 lakhs nett on its first day in India. In India, the film opened with ‚Çπ1.24 crore on its opening day, followed by ‚Çπ1.52 crore on its second day. However, it collected just ‚Çπ16 lakhs on its third day following the cinemas shutdown across Punjab and other states, making the weekend total of ‚Çπ2.92 crore. Box Office India estimated its opening weekend as ‚Çπ5.38 crore if no shutdown has taken place across the country. It opened at No. 6 in Australia with grossing A$99,964 and No. 4 in New Zealand with gross of NZ$36,932 on its opening day. In its opening weekend, the film grossed A$391,757 in Australia from 62 screens with a per-screen average of over A$6,300, and finished fifth in the weekend chart. In New Zealand, it finished fourth, grossing NZ$123,300 in its opening weekend. In United States and Canada, the film grossed US$367,000 from 78 theatres, with highest per-screen average of $4,700 in its opening weekend. The weekend was also noteworthy for being the lowest combined-grossing since October 1998, with all films totaling just $55.3 million. According to Bollywood Hungama, the film grossed US$82,935 in United States, US$305,329 in Canada, ¬£87,842 in United Kingdom, and ‚Ç¨4,831 in Germany in its opening weekend. The film grossed A$538,073 and NZ$161,574 in its opening week in Australia and New Zealand respectively. As of May 2020, the film has grossed US$76,384 at United Arab Emirates.  Critical reception  Chal Mera Putt 2 opened to the positive response from audience and critics. Gautam Batra of Koimoi gave three and a half star out of five. The site's consensus reads, \\"Chal Mera Putt 2 is a film not to be missed. It‚Äôs a thorough family entertainer which will make you laugh, cry and will create a special place in your heart\\". Gurlove Singh of BookMyShow said, \\"Chal Mera Putt 2 is a perfect follow up to the 2019 blockbuster Chal Mera Putt. It‚Äôs heartwarming to see Indian and Pakistani actors share screen space. The quality of cinema that they bring out from their acts is worth applauding. The film has a number of comic sequences that bring the house down\\".  Future  Makers have decided to make another sequel with same cast and crew. The principal photography of the film is expected to begin in July‚ÄìAugust 2020.

The increase measured hardness is believed to be the result of geometrically necessary dislocations. H_0 is the hardness due solely to statistically stored dislocations without the impact of geometrically necessary dislocations. The indentation size effect (ISE) is the observation that hardness tends to increase as the indent size decreases at small scales. When an indent (any small mark, but usually made with a special tool) is created during material testing, the hardness of the material is not constant. At the small scale, materials will actually be harder than at the macro-scale. For the conventional indentation size effect, the smaller the indentation, the larger the difference in hardness. The effect has been seen through nanoindentation and microindentation measurements at varying depths. Dislocations increase material hardness by increasing flow stress through dislocation blocking mechanisms. Materials contain statistically stored dislocations (SSD) which are created by homogeneous strain and are dependent upon the material and processing conditions. Geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) on the other hand are formed, in addition to the dislocations statistically present, to maintain continuity within the material. These additional geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) further increase the flow stress in the material and therefore the measured hardness. Theory suggests that plastic flow is impacted by both strain and the size of the strain gradient experienced in the material. Smaller indents have higher strain gradients relative to the size of the plastic zone and therefore have a higher measured hardness in some materials. Indenter tip generating geometrically necessary dislocations For practical purposes this effect means that hardness in the low micro and nano regimes cannot be directly compared if measured using different loads. However, the benefit of this effect is that it can be used to measure the effects of strain gradients on plasticity. Several new plasticity models have been developed using data from indentation size effect studies, which can be applied to high strain gradient situations such as thin films.

The laydown mechanism utilized both a retarding parachute to slow its descent, a nose cone that is ejected by a small explosive charge prior to impact, and a reinforced steel \\"cookie cutter\\" nose that absorbs the shock of impact with the ground.

Typically, electoral districts cover several administrative districts of an oblast or the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, or a medium-sized city or a part of a large city. They consist of electoral precincts (usually about one hundred of them in each electoral district), which are territorial units of election organization one level lower, and which have the size of several communities or village councils in rural areas or several neighborhoods in cities. The next election to the Verkhovna Rada (set to be in 2023 Early to rejoice? Regular parliamentary elections may take place under Yanukovych's law, Civil movement \\"Chesno\\" (11 July 2019)) will be (for the first time) with different regional open lists (with again an electoral threshold of five percent) and a return (and thus an abolishment of the constituencies with first-past-the-post voting) to only one national constituency.Electoral Code becomes effective in Ukraine, Interfax-Ukraine (1 January 2010)https://112.international/politics/speaker-of-ukrainian-parliament-signs- electoral-code-42995.html In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election Ukraine used the mixed electoral system for the elections of people's deputies, 225 deputies were elected to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by the proportional electoral system (party lists) and 225 by the first-past-the-post electoral system. On presidential elections and for proportional part of parliamentary elections, electoral districts are intermediate links of aggregation of voting results. After the counting of ballots, precinct election commissions determine the results of voting at their precincts. Thereafter, district election commissions determine the results of voting within their electoral districts by summing up the results from all the polling stations belonging to the district. The Central Election Commission then sums up the results of all electoral districts, including the Foreign one, to determine the final results of the voting. In addition to votes counting, district election commissions also deal with many other organizational issues within their electoral districts, including appointing the personal composition of precinct election commissions. As a result of the Russian armed aggression against Ukraine, starting from 2014 elections have not been held in any of the electoral districts of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (constituencies number 1-10, 224 and 225), in some electoral districts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts (collectively known as Donbass) completely (constituencies number 41-44, 53-56 , 61, 104 and 108-111) or partly (counties number 45, 46, 51, 52, 59, 60, 105-107 and 112-114). As a result, there were vacant seats in the 8th and 9th convocations of the Verkhovna Rada, which should have been occupied by majority MPs from the electoral districts in Crimea and in Donbass.  Formation of electoral districts  Electoral districts in their modern form were created on April 28, 2012 by the resolution of the Central Election Commission #82 (up to that moment there was a different system of electoral districts). Initially, they were intended to be used only for parliamentary elections, but in 2019 they were also applied for the presidential election. Different system of electoral districts was used in the 2014 presidential election. The current electoral districts system in theory can be applied to all-Ukrainian referendums, but in practice, no referendums have been held in Ukraine since 2000. The current electoral districts system was used in 2012 parliamentary election, 2014 parliamentary election, 2019 presidential election and 2019 parliamentary election. The electoral districts were formed in a way that the voters were distributed among them as evenly as possible. The law stipulates that the deviation of the number of voters in the electoral district from the national average should not exceed 12%. At the time of electoral districts formation in 2012, this average was 161,125 voters. The law also stipulates that each electoral district must be within one administrative unit of the first level (oblast, city of Kyiv or Sevastopol, Autonomous Republic of Crimea), i.e. it is not allowed for a part of an electoral district to be in one administrative unit and another part in another unit. In addition, territories inhabited by national minorities and adjacent to each other must be included into one electoral district. Referring to this provision, the Hungarian national minority in Zakarpattia Oblast demands the restoration of Tisza electoral district, which existed prior to 2012, but in 2012 the Hungarians were divided between 73rd, 68th and 69th electoral districts, where they now are the minority of voters, which deprived them of the ability to elect their own deputy to the Verkhovna Rada. They have been denied every time, so the Zakarpattia Hungarian Culture Society since 2014 was threatening to sue Ukrainian government in the ECHR for refusing to set up an electoral district that would include territories of compact ethnic Hungarian habitation.  Foreign electoral district  Territories of foreign electoral precincts in the Foreign electoral district of Ukraine The Foreign electoral district of Ukraine is an electoral district, which unites electoral precincts, that are situated outside of the territory of Ukraine, and which comprises all polling station located inside embassies and consulates of Ukraine and inside military bases abroad, where there are Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents. Foreign electoral precincts, unlike usual ones which usually comprise several administrative districts in Ukraine, are much bigger in size. They comprise territories of countries, the whole or a part, or even parts of continents. In the Foreign electoral district there vote those Ukrainian citizens, who on the day of voting are living or just travelling abroad. Foreign district has many differences from usual electoral districts on the territory of Ukraine, but the fundamental difference is that it only aggregates votes cast abroad and do not bear the function of parliamentary representation, since majoritarian deputies are not elected there. Also, the Foreign district does not have its own district election commission, its duties are carried out by the Central Election Commission. As of 31 March 2019 there were 552,357 citizens in the lists of voters of the Foreign electoral district.

The show commemorates the first wrestling show promoted by Adolfo \\"Pirata\\" Moreno in the State of Mexico (Estado de M√©xico) in December 1962. The show was first held in Arena K.O. Al Gusto and later in Arena Naucalpan built in the location of Arena K.O. Al Gusto some years the show has been combined with shows that commemorate the opening of Arena Naucalpan in December 1977. The earliest confirmed anniversary show took place in 2002, for the 40th anniversary. At times IWRG has promoted one of their annual shows as part of the anniversary celebration, such as the Rey del Ring or Prisi√≥n Fatal. The most recent show celebrated the 56th Anniversary held on December 2, 2018. The anniversary shows normally features a Lucha de Apuestas (\\"Bet match\\") where two or more wrestlers \\"bet\\" their wrestling mask or their hair on the outcome of the match. History The building at Calle Jard√≠n 19, Naucalpan Centro, 53000 Naucalpan de Ju√°rez, M√©xico, Mexico was originally an indoor roller rink for the locals in the late part of the 1950s, known as Cafe Algusto. By the early-1960s the building was sold and turned into \\"Arena KO Al Gusto\\" and became a local lucha libre or professional wrestling arena, with a ring permanently set up in the center of the building, holding shows on a regular basis promoted by Adolfo \\"Pirata\\" Moreno. The earliest match reports from Arena KO Al Gusto are dated December 12, 1962 with a main event battle royal that featured wrestler-turned-promoter Adolfo Moreno as one of the participants. Promoter Adolfo Moreno began holding shows on a regular basis often, working with other Mexican promotions such as Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) or the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) to bring lucha libre to Naucalpan. In December 1977, Arena Naucalpan was build on the site of Arena K.O. Al Gusto and as the venue of Moreno's shows, including anniversary shows held to commemorate the first show in 1962. Moreno's promotion, later turned into International Wrestling Revolution Group, usually held at least one major show in December, both to celebrate the anniversary of the promotion as well as the opening of Arena Naucalpan in December 1977 featuring high-profile matches, such as various Lucha de Apuestas (\\"Bet matches\\") where wrestlers would risk their wrestling mask or hair on the outcome of the match. In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. ;Anniversary Lucha de Apuestas losses {  align=\\"center\\" !

The Institute was founded by Robert Roskoski Jr. and he is the only full-time employee. Mission The general goals of the Institute are to explore the interrelationships of fundamental biological science, clinical science, and clinical care.  Research  Research at BRIMR focuses on the structure and regulation of protein kinases, their downstream signaling pathways, and therapeutic drugs that inhibit these enzymes. Protein kinases regulate the activity of their substrate targets by adding phosphate groups in a reaction known as protein phosphorylation. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of about 50 protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of several cancers including those of breast, kidney, and lung and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. An average of two to three new drugs of this type is approved annually. An important component of the Institute's fundamental research involves the study of the nature of the interaction of these anticancer and anti-inflammatory agents with their target protein kinase enzyme. Institute studies are based upon the X-ray crystallographic results that are in the public domain as well as in-house computer-generated models of drugs binding to their targets. The Institute functions as a scientific think tank and performs no actual laboratory work. However, the Institute uses results from the research areas of biochemistry and molecular, chemical, structural and cancer biology in an effort to understand the mechanisms of action of protein kinase inhibitors and the aberrations that result in neoplastic growth. The results of these studies have been published.  NIH funding data  The Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research has monitored NIH funding to Medical Schools as well as other health science schools and organizations since 2006. BRIMR generates an annual ranking of NIH funding for US Medical Schools and their Departments and the BRIMR data is considered to be the gold standard for medical school research metrics.

Conner Peripherals, a major HDD manufacturer, was founded in 1987, and by 1990 had become the fastest-growing start-up in the history of U.S. commerce up until that point. Conner Peripherals was acquired by Seagate in 1996.  Background  Finis F Conner.Photo of Finis Conner at Seagate's 40th Anniversary in 2019 (pronounced Fy-niss) was born on July 28, 1943 in Gadsden, Alabama. He was the last of five children born to a carpenter and his wife. Conner grew up poor in Alabama, Texas and Florida. At the age of 19, with $100 in his pocket, he boarded a train for San Jose, California where a brother lived. Conner found a job as a clerk-typist at IBM and put himself through college, earning a degree in industrial management from San Jose State College in 1969.  Shugart Associates  Conner at Memorex in the early 1970s met Alan Shugart. In 1973, Shugart, Conner, and seven others founded Shugart Associates, a company that pioneered the development of floppy disks.Shugart Associates original business plan, 1973 ca., pp. 312-4 At Shugart Associates, Conner was initially responsible for OEM Marketing ultimately becoming its Western Region Sales Manager.Seagate Technology Prospectus, September 30, 1981, p. 16 Shugart Associates was acquired in 1977 by Xerox.  Seagate Technology  In 1979, Conner, Shugart, and two others founded the hard drive manufacturer Seagate Technology. Seagate pioneered the 5.25-inch hard disk drive form factor. The first 5.25-inch HDD was the ST506. Its capacity was 5 MBytes. By 1984, there were differences with Seagate management with Conner arguing that there was not enough emphasis on customer requests Conner left Seagate (with $12 million in Seagate stock) to enjoy a semi-retirement.  Conner Peripherals  In 1985 John Squires left Miniscribe and with financing from Terry Johnson (another Miniscribe founder) founded CoData to work on a new 3.5-inch disk drive. With a prototype of their product completed, Squires and Johnson in late 1985 approached Conner about joining Codata. In 1986, Conner merged his then defunct company Conner Peripherals into Squires and Johnson's CoData, adopting the name Conner Peripherals for the merged entity. Conner had trouble finding financing from venture capitalists, so he approached Compaq Computer, which was looking for a new disk drive for a portable computer that was under development. Compaq provided $12 million of capital and by 1987 (the first year of mass production), Conner had sold $113 million in 3.5\\" HDDs - with 90% going Compaq. The first 3.5-inch product was the CP340 HDD with a capacity of 20 MBytes. The subsequent HDD, CP341, established the popularity of the ATA interface supplied by Western Digital. By 1990, Conner Peripherals was the fastest growing start-up company in the history of US commerce, beating the competition with HDDs that were lighter, more compact, and consumed less power. According to Finis Conner, one key aspect of success was to buy all the components (heads, disks, motors, chips) from other manufacturers but to excel in high-volume assembly and manufacturing. Conner peripherals was merged into Seagate in February 1996 at which point he left the company. For its fiscal year ending December 31, 1995 Conner reported about $2.4 billion in revenue compared to Seagate's fiscal year revenue of $4.5 billion.  Post Conner Peripherals  Since the merger with Seagate, Conner has pursued a number of activities: *He set up Conner GroupWebsite: Conner Group History which includes several enterprises some of which focus on Conner's interest in golf. *Conner Technology PLC was a manufacturer of low-cost 3.5-inch hard disk drives assembled in China, whose goal was to be a high-volume, low-cost supplier of mainstream hard disk drives to leading personal computer suppliers. The company could never deliver the low prices required for personal computer suppliers to switch, and the company shut down its operations in 1998 and merged with ExcelStor in 2001. *StorCard founded in 2002 was a company dedicated to developing a new standard in high capacity smart cards. StorCard offered an encrypted, low-cost removable card using semiconductor memory in a credit card size format, along with a compatible receiver mechanism.

During the late Qing dynasty, there was a movement for a constitution. With the later years of the Guangxu Emperor, Shanqi was known to be sympathetic to revolutionaries. During the early days of the Xuantong Emperor (Puyi), when plans to assassinate the regent, Zaifeng, by Wang Zhaoming were revealed, Shanqi was questioned by Zaifeng. In 1908, Shanqi joined a group supervising the Admiralty (haijun yamen). He was an acquaintance of the Manchu Jinliang. He served terms at the Ministry of the Interior, when he developed the gendarmerie, and the Ministry of Dependencies. These terms overlapped. He held the position of Bujun tongling (Head of the Gendarmerie). In early 1909, Shanqi, as the head of civilian affairs, drew up a plan to cut down administrative spending and focus more on police personnel as a way to reduce police spending as a whole. This led to the removal and replacement of the positions of Guichang and Qiyuan within the police force.Gabbiani, Luca. \\"The Redemption of the Rascals\\": The Xinzheng Reforms and the Transformation of the Status of Lower-Level Central Administration Personnel.

After the Xinhai Revolution, Shanqi formed the backbone of the Royalist Party, proclaiming his \\"official duty to the lord\\" (junchen dayi). Shanqi refused to accept the abdication of Xuantong and was smuggled to the Japanese concession of Port Arthur in the Kwantung Leased Territory.Valliant, Robert B. ‚ÄúJAPANESE INVOLVEMENT IN MONGOL INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENTS, 1912-1919.‚Äù The Mongolia Society Bulletin, vol. 11, no. 2 (21), 1972, pp. 1‚Äì32.

In 1912, Shanqi gained Japanese support to create an independent Manchu state under Puyi along with his 14th daughter, Jin Bihui, whom he had allowed to be adopted by Kawashima Naniwa (Jin Bihui changed her name to Yoshiko Kawashima to reflect this). However, this plan failed when the Japanese withdrew their support in favor of working with Yuan Shikai. Before and after the Manchu Restoration by Zhang Xun in 1917, two Manchu-Mongol independence movements were launched, both of which ended in failure. Shanqi was involved in the first one. The 1916 Manchu-Mongol Independence Movement, supported by businessman Okura Kihachiro, involved a one million yen investment to the Royalist Party, who held an army in Manchuria, composed of restorationists and Mongolian bandits. These funds were used to buy and transport arms. General Tanaka Giichi was to assist him in capturing Mukden and setting up a Manchurian state North of the Great Wall, eventually striking Beijing. This uprising was to be started on 15 April 1916, and timed to be at the same time as the National Protection War. However, as Tanaka was unable to receive arms in time, he suspended the operations on 4 April.Altman, Albert A., and Harold Z. Schiffrin. ‚ÄúSun Yat-Sen and the Japanese: 1914-16.‚Äù Modern Asian Studies, vol. 6, no. 4, 1972, pp. 385‚Äì400. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/311539. Accessed 13 January 2020. After Yuan Shikai's death, the Japanese decided that if the new President of China, Li Yuanhong, was responsive to the Japanese, Japan would give their support to the Chinese government. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, who wanted to dismantle the Manchu-Mongol Independence Movement, reached an agreement with Kawashima Naniwa. Shanqi's men were to be disbanded in 16 days from the agreement. The loans given to him were to be continued, but the 215,000 yen used by Kawashima would be deducted. On 7 September, the movement was officially disbanded. In 1922, Shanqi died in L√ºshun. His body was transported to the Prince Su Cemetery in Beijing. During his lifetime, Shanqi never reconciled with the Republic of China. Due to his loyalty (zhong) to Puyi, he was posthumously named Prince Su Zhong (, Su Zhong Qinwang).

Lucha Brothers (Pentag√≥n Jr. and F√©nix) successfully defended the AAA World Tag Team Championship against Jinetes del Aire (El Hijo del Vikingo and Myzteziz Jr.) and Australian Suicide/Rey Horus. Production Background Starting in 1997 the Mexican professional wrestling, company AAA has held a major wrestling show late in the year, either November or December, called Guerra de Titanes (\\"War of the Titans\\"). The show often features championship matches or Lucha de Apuestas or bet matches where the competitors risked their wrestling mask or hair on the outcome of the match. In Lucha Libre, the Lucha de Apuetas match is considered more prestigious than a championship match and many major shows feature one or more Apuesta matches. The Guerra de Titanes show is hosted in a new location each year, emanating from cities such as Madero, Chihuahua City, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Jalisco and others. In 2016, AAA moved the Guerra de Titanes show to January but in 2018 the show was held in December which continued with the 2019 event. Storylines Guerra de Titanes featured eight professional wrestling matches, with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in wrestling matches. Aftermath After the main event match, it was announced that Rush El Toro Blanco, La Bestia del Ring, Killer Kross, L.A. Park and Konnan were forming a new group called La Facci√≥n Ingobernable (based on Rush's Los Ingobernables group from CMLL).

It is situated northwest of Coquihalla Summit, northeast of Alpaca Peak, and southwest of Guanaco Peak, its nearest higher peak, by a mere one metre. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains west into headwaters of the East Anderson River, or east into headwaters of the Coldwater River. The mountain was named for the vicu√±a, as part of the animal names theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of the 1974 first ascent party. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Vicuna Peak in winter During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Vicuna Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Vicuna Peak.

The decline of the poverty rate has been very significant for Tamil Nadu, that it takes much of the pain to the political criticism against the Dravidian parties about corruption in the administration. The substantial reduction in urban and rural poverty at a huge level since the economic improvements of the 1990s, shows that poverty reduction and social well-being programmes have brought in rising incomes for the poor. Kanyakumari is the district with the highest Human Development Index in the report of 2017. Kanyakumari also has the highest literacy rate in the state. Ariyalur has the lowest HDI in the 2017 report. Thoothukudi, with high life expectancy and high literacy rate, is in the top five districts. Ariyalur and Perambalur, due to its Per capita income being so low, came in the bottom five. Coimbatore, in spite of its high degree of industrialisation and Per capita income, does not rank in the top five districts with high Human Development Index in the report of 2017. The previous report of 2003 showed that Chennai, Kancheepuram, Kanyakumari, Thoothukudi and Coimbatore were the top five districts. Though the two sets of reports are not strictly comparable given the separation of some districts between the two time points, some relative observations are made. According to the latest report, Kanyakumari has reached the top position, while Coimbatore does not even figure in the top five. The new entrant in the top five district category is Virudhunagar in the latest Human development report. Virudhunagar's rise to the top has been primarily due to its relatively higher per capita income which in turn can be connected to the spread of small scale industries, and a vibrant agricultural marketing economy. The five districts in the bottom of the previous report are Perambalur, Villupuram, Dharmapuri, Tirunelveli and Pudukottai. Many of these districts have been separated, but Perambalur and Villupuram continue to be at the bottom. Theni has newly entered into the bottom five positions.

She was the daughter of Alice Springs Chinese Market gardener Ah Hong and his indigenous Western Arrernte wife Ranjika. Lee travelled between Australia and China and experienced discrimination because of her mixed parentage. She is included in the archive collection of the Women's Museum of Australia, formerly known as the National Pioneer Women's Hall of Fame. Her oral history is held at the National Library of Australia.  Early life  Lee was born in a creek under a tree, in Stuart (what would become Alice Springs), Australia, in 1908, the youngest child of Ah Hong and Ranjika. Lee's family ran a market garden on Todd Street and their house was popular with bush men needing a \\"good feed\\" when they came to town. As a child the government attempted to take Lee and her siblings Ada and Dempsey, to live at The Bungalow, and institution for Aboriginal children. Her father protected them from being taken from him by threatening to shoot the policeman who was sent to take the children. Lee would later attend school at The Bungalow, where she was taught by Ida Standley, during the day, but was not required to live there. Ranjika died in childbirth in 1914 and in 1918 Ah Hong sold his market garden and took his three children to China, to be cared for by relatives. It was a yearlong journey; the family had to first travel to Darwin by horse and buggy before taking a ship. In China she was welcomed by her father's family who, although aware her mother was Aboriginal, welcomed her with open arms and was respectful towards her. Her father spent a year in China with Lee and her siblings, and then returned to Alice Springs alone in 1920. While Lee lived in China, she went to school, learning to read and write in Cantonese, until she was 15 or 16 years old. Following the completion of her schooling, she assisted her family in the home, as was expected at the time.  Life in Alice Springs  Lee decided to return to Alice Springs in 1929. Lee was the first Aboriginal woman in Alice Springs to own a house. She purchased the land herself with her earnings from mining and hospital work, and she managed and supervised the construction of her house herself. She struggled to fit in with Aboriginal people who considered her Chinese while Chinese people viewed her as Aboriginal. Lee became pregnant with the child of Englishman Fred 'Lofty' Purdy; she was rejected by her father for not marrying a Chinese man. Lee and Purdy married at the Catholic Church in Alice Springs and lived in a simple house, with dirt floors, near her father's market garden which was now located on Gap Road. They are also recorded as mining together at Hatches Creek for wolframite. She was known as a hard-working woman miner who was also a well- educated avid reader of history, politics and culture. During her lifetime she was outspoken about social issues, and often wrote letters to the editor of the local newspapers. Lee and Purdy had four daughters together in the 1930s - 1940s: Valencia, Olive, Peg and Joyce, all of whom all attended school at Our Lady of Sacred Heart Convent School. When her father died in 1952, she was his only surviving child. In 1953, after the breakup of her marriage, Lee moved to Brisbane where she eventually married William Lee, a Chinese man. Following her death in 1995, Lee was buried in Alice Springs.  Legacy  The Gloria Lee Ngale Environmental Learning Centre in Alice Springs was named for Lee by her daughter Olive Veverbrants. The purpose of the centre is to provide indigenous people with the knowledge and technologies for creating sustainable food production and healthy lifestyles. The centre was built using sustainable architectural design practices. It is powered completely on solar energy, uses composting toilets, and a grey water system for watering the food gardens. Many of Lee's descendants live in around the Northern Territory and Alice Springs. Lee is the grandmother of Olga Havnen, an Aboriginal activist and leader. Havnen cites her grandmother as an inspiration for her advocacy.  Oral history  Lee's oral history was tape-recorded as part of a project for the National Library of Australia documenting the lives of Chinese Australians. The oral history was published in the form of an interview in the book, Astronauts, Lost Souls & Dragons: Voices of Today's Chinese Australians (Diana Giese, University of Queensland Press, 1997)  References   External links  * Gloria Purdy-Lee on Billion Graves Category:People from Alice Springs Category:1908 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Australian expatriates in China Category:Chinese Australian ","title":"Gloria Ouida Lee"},{"id":"62389966","text":"The National Youth Parliament concept in Ghana is to provide a single formalized youth structure at the district, regional and national levels for the youth to air their frustrations, deliberate on matters of importance to youth development, and hold duty bearers accountable. it is basically aimed at providing the platform to mobilize the youth for action through providing accountability, transparency and equitable society for the ready youth.

Robam Kenorei (Khmer: ·ûö·ûî·û∂·üÜ·ûÄ·û∑·ûì·üí·ûì·ûö·û∏) or Robam Kenor is one of Cambodian traditional dance depicting a group of benevolent half-human, half-bird creatures dancing in a lotus pond that frequently performed in the Royal Ballet of Cambodia.  Etymology  The word robam in the Khmer language is referred to traditional dance. One of the earliest records of dance (Khmer: robam/ rabam) in Cambodia is from the 7th century, where performances were used as a funeral rite for kings. During the Angkor period, dance was ritually performed at temples. Kenorei is derived from Sanskrit Kinnari for female half-human, half-bird creatures believed to have lived in the Himalayas. While kenor or kenora is derived from kinnara for male or the species of this creatures.  History  The oldest depiction of kinnara in Cambodia is seen at 7th century temples of Sambor Prey Kuk, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In Angkorian period, kinnara and kinnari frequently depicted on Angkorian temples with different appearance. At Angkor Wat, there are also several depictions of these male and female half-human and half-bird creature dancing. Kenors are also commonly seen carved into support figurines for the columns of post-Angkorian architecture. King Sisowath at the 1906 Colonial Exposition in Marseilles. In 1906, Kenorei dancers performed in Europe for the first time at the Colonial Exposition in Marseilles during the reign of King Sisowat. During the Khmer Rouge (1975-1979) atrocity in Cambodia, the dance almost vanished and reappeared again in 2000s under the leadership of Prince Norodom Bupphadevi, the first master Royal Ballet of Cambodia.  Characters and costumes  Cambodian kenorei dancer performed at Phnom Penh National Museum in 1920s. The main and sole characters play in Robam Kenorei are the group of these female half-human, half-bird creatures known as Kenorei. Kenorei characters wears distinct costumes compares to that of other characters in the Royal Ballet of Cambodia. The costumes of this character illustrates a bird creatures consisting of tail and wings-like decoration. Kenorei's costumes are colorful and vary to which dance dramas they are accompanied. Kenorei wears mokot ksatrei, a single-spire crown with a kbang (a front crown). The ears are adorned with flora (flower and lbak pkar on both side), the earings, and chor trajeak (ears decorating jewelry). Kenorei does not wear sbai (a shawl-like garment worn in Cambodia) and only wears a soft long-sleeved silk shirt. An embroidered collar known as srang kor is worn around the neck and over the shirt. Connecting from the srang kor are a sort of epaulette that arches upwards on the shoulder but distinct from inthanu worn by most male characters. Kenorei character wears gold bras on the chest unlike any role in the Royal Ballet of Cambodia. A distinct decorated X-like strap around the body is worn over the body with an embroidered ornament in the middle. Kenorei characters do not wear sampot sarabap nor sampot chang kben like other characters, instead they wear a knee-length pants, displaying a distinctively wide and embroidered hem around the knees, representing the foot of a bird. A pair of colorfully embroidered bird's wings-like clothes are worn from the front waist back wards. Below these wing- shaped cloth pieces is a bird's tail-like colorfully embroidered piece worn like a bird at the back. Below these wing and tail-like cloth pieces is another piece of silk covering the back side of the pants. In the middle of the wing-like pieces is a belt buckle connecting with a robang muk, decorated distinctively for bird character placing downward. Similar to other characters, the jewelry for this Kenorei includes various types of ankle and wrists bracelets and bangles with many styles.  Performance  Robam Kenorei are performed as a group of female half-human, half-bird creatures dancing in a lotus pond. In other dance drama of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, Kenorei dance is included in those dance dramas as an additional dance. For instance, kenorei dance are accompanied in a dance drama of Neang Waddhana Devi in a scene where Princess Waddhana Devi lost her consciousness and Kenoreis woke her up. In another dance drama known as Preah Anoruth-Neang Usa, Kenoreis play significant role in this dance drama where Anoruth (Aniruddha) and his companions fell in love with a group of five Kenoreis and lured them.  Cultural Symbol  Kenorei are considered symbols of beauty and skilled dancers. Cambodian authors frequently compare a beautiful lady to Kenorei. The Kenorei is a character archetype in the repertoire of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, appearing as mischievous groups that have a strong allurement.

Photo of Mr. Ah Hong and young child from the John Blakeman Collection; Library & Archives NT  Early life  Hong was born in Canton, now Guangzhou, around 1857 and little is known of his early life. His descendants believe that he travelled to Australia some time in the 1870s.  Life in the Northern Territory  When Hong first arrived in the Northern Territory, some time in the 1870s, he first worked in the Top End on the Pine Creek goldfields and then the North Australia Railway before moving to Central Australia as a cook for the crews building the Overland Telegraph. He later described witnessing many of the thousands of fellow Chinese immigrants dying in the harsh labor conditions of railway construction. Once in Central Australia, he first worked as a cook at Bond Springs Station and then, briefly, as a miner at Arltunga. In 1892 Hong settled in Alice Springs, then known as Stuart, and established a market garden on Todd Street on what is now the site of Megafauna Central (see: Todd Mall). At his garden Hong grew a variety of vegetables and raised chickens. He sold his produce using a horse and cart, sometimes as far as Arltunga. Hong met and married Ranjika, a Western Arrernte woman, and they ran the garden together with the help of Bulabaka, one of Ranjika's three sons from a previous relationship. Hong and Ranjika had three children together: Dempsey, Ada and Gloria. As children of a mixed marriage they were exposed to significant amount of racism. Education for his children was important to Hong and he sent his two eldest children, Dempsey and Ada, to school in Oodnadatta before the establishment of the first school in Alice Springs in 1914 where the children were taught, with other Aboriginal children, by Ida Standley at The Bungalow. Following the death of Ranjika in 1918, Hong took his children to China to be cared for by his family there. After a year long journey, Hong spent a year there before returning alone to Alice Springs. Once in Alice Springs again, Hong established a market garden on a new site, on Gap Road, where he also established an eating house for single men who were welcome to 'roll out their swags' in the garden for the price of a meal and built a large stone oven to become one of the town's first bakers. Hong died in 1952, at the age of 102.  Legacy  Hong was highly respected in the community of Alice Springs. When he died, the Centralian Advocate described his passing as marking a milestone in local history: Many of Hong's descendants live in and around the Northern Territory and Alice Springs. Hong Street in Gillen (a suburb of Alice Springs) is named for him.

He founded hospitals in Hawaii and Japan, and also founded the Seizasha Dojo.  Biography  Kobayashi was born in 1863 in Harima, Japan to a family of pharmacists. In 1883, he began to study medicine under Matsumoto Jun. Once he was licensed to practice in Japan, he decided to study abroad. He studied at the Cooper Medical College, then practiced medicine in San Francisco. He also traveled to England and Germany, where he later learned bacteriology. Kobayashi moved to Hawaii in 1892. At first, he lived in Wailuku and became well-known for doing brain surgeries. He, fellow Cooper graduate Iga Mori, and Matsujiro Misawa opened a small hospital in central Honolulu in 1896. The hospital later expanded and moved to Liliha, a neighborhood in Honolulu, in 1899. It was called the Japanese Hospital, but is not to be confused with the Japanese Charity Hospital that was formed by the Japanese Benevolent Society and later became the Kuakini Medical Center. In 1901 Kobayashi fell gravely ill, and called for someone to give him his last rites. Yemyo Imamura came and prayed for him. When Kobayashi got better, he was so influenced by Imamura that he converted to Shingon Buddhism. He became a member of the Young Men's Buddhist Association, and published articles in their magazine, the D≈çh≈ç. After his conversion, Kobayashi's healing philosophy mixed Buddhism and medicine. He moved back to Japan in 1908 and started a Buddhist hospital in Kyoto. He and his wife Nobuko also started the Seizasha Dojo. They suggested that conditions like neurasthenia could be treated by sitting quietly in the seiza position following Torajiro Okada's \\"Okada-shiki seiza\\" (Okada-style seiza) method. They claimed that doing so would calm and purify the patient's thoughts. Kobayashi died in 1926.

Biography  He began his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli, and completed them in Rome, where he came under the influence of the Neoclassical painter Vincenzo Camuccini. In 1843, he was introduced to Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, who hired him as a court painter and Master of Painting for the Empress consort, Teresa Cristina. At the age of thirty-three, he became the leading artist in Brazil and was charged with reorganizing the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in R√≠o de Janeiro. Six years later, in 1849, the Chilean Consul in Brazil, Carlos Hochkolf, invited him to come to Chile and help establish an art academy there. He accepted the offer and was instrumental in creating the in Santiago. He served as director of the Academy of twenty years; focusing on the European Academic tradition, with focus on the Greco-Roman canons. The institution was often criticized for discouraging creativity and ignoring the artistic possibilities of Chile itself. Among his harshest critics were the French-born painter, and one of the Academy's first students, Antonio Smith. Despite these criticisms, most of Chile's prominent painters of the time began as his students; including Nicol√°s Guzm√°n Bustamante, Pascual Ortega, Pedro Lira, Cosme San Mart√≠n, Onofre Jarpa and Agustina Guti√©rrez. In 1853 he became a Chilean citizen. In 1869, he resigned his position at the Academy and was replaced by the German-born painter, . He remained in Chile until his death.

Lakes in calderas fill large craters formed by the collapse of a volcano during an eruption. Lakes in maars fill medium-sized craters where an eruption deposited debris around a vent. Crater lakes form as the created depression, within the crater rim, is filled by water. The water may come from precipitation, groundwater circulation (often hydrothermal fluids in the case of volcanic craters) or melted ice. Its level rises until an equilibrium is reached between the rates of incoming and outgoing water. Sources of water loss singly or together may include evaporation, subsurface seepage, and, in places, surface leakage or overflow when the lake level reaches the lowest point on its rim. At such a saddle location, the upper portion of the lake is contained only by its adjacent natural volcanic dam; continued leakage through or surface outflow across the dam can erode its included material, thus lowering lake level until a new equilibrium of water flow, erosion, and rock resistance is established. If the volcanic dam portion erodes rapidly or fails catastrophically, the occurrence produces a breakout or outburst flood. With changes in environmental conditions over time, the occurrence of such floods is common to all natural dam types. A well-known crater lake, which bears the same name as the geological feature, is Crater Lake in Oregon. It is located in the caldera of Mount Mazama. It is the deepest lake in the United States with a depth of . Crater Lake is fed solely by falling rain and snow, with no inflow or outflow at the surface, and hence is one of the clearest lakes in the world. The highest volcano in the world, 6,893-m (22,615-ft) Ojos del Salado in Chile, has a permanent crater lake about in diameter at an elevation of on its eastern side.Andes Website ‚Äì Information about Ojos del Salado volcano, a high mountain in South America and the World's highest volcano This is most likely the highest lake of any kind in the world. Due to their unstable environments, some crater lakes exist only intermittently. Caldera lakes in contrast can be quite large and long- lasting. For instance, Lake Toba (Indonesia) formed after its eruption around 75,000 years ago. At around 100 km (60 miles) by 30 km (18 miles) in extent and 505 m (1,656 ft) deep at its deepest point, Lake Toba is the largest crater lake in the world. While many crater lakes are picturesque, they can also be deadly. Gas discharges from Lake Nyos in (Cameroon) suffocated 1,800 people in 1986, and crater lakes such as Mount Ruapehu's (New Zealand) often contribute to destructive lahars. Certain bodies of water, although their formation is directly related to volcanic activity, are not usually referred to as crater lakes, including: *Lakes created by volcanic dams due to lava flowing outside of the volcanic edifice/caldera (such as Garibaldi Lake in Canada, Fuji Five Lakes in Japan) *Closed atoll lagoons (such as Clipperton lagoon), whose formation process also implies subsequent biogeomorphologic processes *Ponds encountered at the bottom of waterfalls occurring in volcanic canyons in a volcanic context, but not within a volcanic edifice/caldera (such as Trou de Fer on R√©union Island) Lake Barombi, Cameroon Lake Mbalang , Cameroon Lake Awing, Cameroon Mount Mbapit crater lake, Cameroon Lake Tison, Cameroon Lake Bambili, North West Cameroon Lake Monoun exploded in 1984, Cameroon Lake Manengouba,Cameroon  List of volcanic crater lakes  {  !

It is the highest summit of the Anderson River Group, a subset of the North Cascades. It is situated northwest of Coquihalla Summit, and northeast of Vicuna Peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains west into headwaters of the East Anderson River, or east into headwaters of the Coldwater River. The mountain was named for the guanaco, as part of the animal names theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of the 1974 first ascent party. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Vicuna and Guanaco in winter During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Guanaco Peak, Vicuna Peak, Alpaca Peak Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Guanaco Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Guanaco Peak.

Nijhum Dweep National Park covers approximately of Mangrove forests Biome. The land was declared as national park by the Bangladesh government on 8 April 2001 under the Wildlife Act of 1974. Location It is located south west of Hatiya. The Nijhum Dwip comprises four to five small islands namely Char Osman, Char Kamla, Char Muri and Bellar Char islands. The area is mainly composed of Intertidal mudflats and sand flats. It has a sandy beach and grassland. The climate is generally humid and warm. Plants and Animals Flora The general walk in the forest is not easy due to muddy soil and pneumatophores of Sonneratia apetala (Keora) and Avicennia alba (Baine) trees. About 152 plant species belonging to 56 families have been recorded. Seven plant species recorded as rare are Bruguiera gymnorhiza (kakra), Derris trifoliata, Diospyros blancoi, Tamarix gallica, Heliotropium currasavicum, Typha elephentanea, Sarcolobus carinatus. Fauna The majority of animals found are spotted deer, which can be seen in plenty here. Other animals seen here are clawless otter, jackals, mongoose, monitor lizard, fishing cat, turtles and dolphins. The park is notable because it contains world's largest population of Indian skimmer birds. More than 100 species of migratory and resident birds are recorded in the national park. The water bodies are a major busiest airport for migratory birds. Globally threatened birds like Spoon-billed sandpiper, Asian Dowitcher, Nordmann's greenshank, Spotted redshank, Goliath Heron and Indian Skimmers are seen here. The tributaries around the islands are abode to Ganges Dolphin, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Finless Porpoise and Irrawaddy Dolphin.The channels are very rich in micro benthos and other invertebrates. Indian Skimmer Human Settlement There are scanty human habitation inside the National park area. There are 8 thousand inhabitants with fishing and cultivation as major livelihood Registered forest villagers have certain rights within the reserve. This includes wood collection for fuel and building materials, hunting, betel leaf production, grazing of livestock, harvesting of other forest products, and limited agriculture in allocated land.

Catch-my-Pal, alternatively known as the 'Protestant Total-Abstinence Union', was an anti- alcohol organisation founded on 13 July 1909 in Armagh, Ireland. The organisation closed down in January 1970 when its last club stopped operations.Barkley, J., 1972. St. Enoch‚Äôs Congregation 1872-1972. Century Services, Belfast. pp84-85 Its distinctive feature was that members would competitively persuade one of their friends to come with them and take 'the pledge' at each meeting. This 'Catch-my-Pal' method - the phrase was coined by its founder, Rev. Robert Patterson - was later used to recruit the 'Pals' Battalions to the British Army in the Great War. History Rev. Robert Patterson was the Minister of the 3rd Armagh Congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, who went on to become full-time Organising Secretary of the Union and was later Minister of the Crumlin Road Congregation in Belfast. Patterson was both an Orangeman and a pioneer in the field of Presbyterian/Roman Catholic Inter-Church relations. The movement attracted a large number of followers in Ireland and Great Britain.

It is often eaten as anju, food consumed while drinking, in South Korea. Julia Moskin, writing for The New York Times, called yangnyeom chicken \\"the apotheosis of the Korean style\\" of fried chicken. Etymology The word chicken () in South Korea refers to fried chicken, and sometimes roasted chicken; yangnyeom () is Korean for \\"seasoned\\". Therefore, yangnyeom chicken () means \\"seasoned fried chicken\\" in Korean. Unseasoned fried chicken is called dakgogi-twigim (; chicken meat fritter) or fried chicken (). Outside Korea, yangnyeom chicken is known as Korean fried chicken. History Fried chicken became popular in South Korea in the 1970s; the first fried chicken restaurant in South Korea, Lim's Chicken, opened in 1977. The initial developer of yangnyeom chicken, Yoon Jonggye, devised it in his restaurant after analyzing the leftover food of his customers. He noticed that the regular fried chicken crust was too crunchy and scratched the palates of customers, so he coated the fried chicken with a sauce to soften the crust, creating the recipe for yangnyeom chicken. However, it was commercialized by Yang Heekwon, who founded the restaurant chain Pelicana Chicken. Initially, customers were unwilling to buy the yangnyeom chicken. Free food samples were given to customers as part of the marketing campaign, which significantly increased the sales in two months. A jingle in a Pelicana commercial featuring popular comedian further contributed to the popularity of the dish. The naming and trademark status of yangnyeom was argued in the South Korean courts in the 1990s, culminating in a 1997 ruling by the supreme court. Yangnyeom chicken restaurants gained in popularity and have been opened in other countries, including the United States, Australia, Taiwan, China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Vietnam. Preparation and serving Half yangnyeom chicken, half fried chicken from BHC chicken franchise A chicken is cut into pieces, or boneless chicken into bite-size pieces, and seasoned with salt and powdered black pepper. Sometimes cheonju (rice wine) or curry powder is added to get rid of the strong poultry smell. The seasoned chicken is coated in batter made with eggs and starch powder and deep-fried twice, with the resulting crust \\"thin, crackly and almost transparent,\\" according to Moskin. The chicken is then coated with sauce. Sometimes it is sprinkled with chopped peanuts, sesame seeds, chopped garlic, or sliced green onions. Pickled radish is a common accompaniment. The sauce is made of starch syrup or strawberry jam, ketchup, gochujang, dark soy sauce, minced garlic, ground red pepper, brown sugar, and sometimes other seasonings and boiled briefly to thicken. Commercial sauces are available.; Coating in sauce causes the crust of yangnyeom chicken to get soggy very fast; consuming it immediately after purchase is recommended unless one prefers the moist crust to the crispy one. Yangnyeom chicken tends to be popular among those who do not enjoy the oily taste of fried chicken. On the other hand, those who may not enjoy the sweetish taste and tempura that gets soggy very fast prefer eating fried chicken. There are people who want both styles of chicken; the order of \\"banban\\" (; half-and-half), meaning \\"half yangnyeom chicken, half fried chicken\\", is common in Korea. The addition of the sauce makes yangnyeom chicken slightly more expensive to prepare than fried chicken. Some restaurants have attempted to cut costs by deep-frying chicken in old cooking oil or using low-quality or expired meat, using the sauce to obscure the lower quality of the completed dish. Dietary information According to the Korea Consumer Agency, a whole yangnyeom chicken has 2,700‚Äì2,900 calories, more than a fried chicken, because approximately 1,000 calories are added by the sauce.; ; See also * Buffalo wing * Crispy fried chicken * Padak Reference External links * Category:Deep fried foods Category:South Korean chicken dishes Category:Fried chicken ","title":"Yangnyeom chicken"},{"id":"62391260","text":"The seventh season of Dynasty originally aired in the United States on ABC from September 24, 1986 through May 5, 1987. The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Season seven stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis's earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis's eldest son Adam; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis's husband Dex Dexter; Karen Cellini as Blake and Alexis's youngest daughter, Amanda; Diahann Carroll as Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux; Wayne Northrop as Blake's former chauffeur Michael Culhane; Ted McGinley as Clay Fallmont; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven, and Amanda. The season also features Christopher Cazenove as Blake's brother, Ben Carrington; Kate O'Mara as Alexis' sister Caress Morell; Terri Garber as Ben's daughter Leslie; Leann Hunley as Blake's secretary Dana Waring; and Cassie Yates as Sarah Curtis, and old friend of Dex's. Though starring as Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington on The Colbys, John James and Emma Samms each appeared in two episodes of season seven as these characters. Development Although the first episode of season seven, \\"The Victory\\", premiered with a high Nielsen rating of a 20.1, it was overtaken by Magnum, P.I., now in the same time slot on CBS. Dynasty ultimately fell to #24 in the United States for the season. During the period between the production of seasons six and seven, Catherine Oxenberg vacated the role of Amanda Carrington, purportedly due to a salary dispute. Oxenberg's publicist insisted that the actress left Dynasty voluntarily, while several media outlets reported that she was fired. The role was immediately recast with Karen Cellini, who appeared for 13 episodes of the series' seventh season before the character was written out in the 1987 episode \\"The Rig\\". Plot As the seventh season begins, Blake stops short of killing Alexis, who has taken all of his assets, including the mansion. Claudia has died in the fire she set at La Mirage, and Amanda (now played by Karen Cellini) is rescued by a returning Michael Culhane, Blake's chauffeur from the first season. Blake turns the tables on Ben and Alexis and recovers his wealth, but loses his memory after an oil rig explosion. Alexis finds Blake and, with everyone believing he is dead, perpetuates the belief that they are still married. Living with a clean slate, Alexis finds herself softening to Blake but ultimately tells him the truth as he reunites with Krystle. Krystina receives a heart transplant but is later temporarily kidnapped by Sarah Curtis, the mother of the girl from whom Krystina received her new heart; Sammy Jo's marriage to Clay crumbles and she falls into bed with Steven; Amanda leaves town; and Ben's daughter Leslie arrives. Adam's season-long romance with Blake's secretary Dana Waring culminates in a wedding, which is punctuated in the May 6, 1987 season finale by Alexis's car plunging off a bridge into a river and the violent return of a vengeful Matthew Blaisdel (Bo Hopkins).

The clashes resulted nearly 1,000 killed. It was the most significant dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway in modern times, prior to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War of the 1980s. Background Iran repudiated the demarcation line established in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of Constantinople of November 1913. Iran asked the border to run along the thalweg, the deepest point of the navigable channel. Iraqi Kingdom, encouraged by Britain, took Iran to the League of Nations in 1934, but their disagreement was not resolved. Finally in 1937 Iran and Iraq signed their first boundary treaty. The treaty established the waterway border on the eastern bank of the river except for a four-mile anchorage zone near Abadan, which was allotted to Iran and where the border ran along the thalweg. Iran sent a delegation to Iraqi Republic soon after the Ba'ath coup in 1969 and, when Iraq refused to proceed with negotiations over a new treaty, the treaty of 1937 was withdrawn by Iran. The Iranian abrogation of the 1937 treaty marked the beginning of a period of acute Iraqi-Iranian tension that was to last until the Algiers Accords of 1975.Karsh, Efraim The Iran-Iraq War 1980‚Äì1988, London: Osprey, 2002 page 8 Events From March 1974 to March 1975, Iran and Iraq fought border skirmishes over Iran's support of Iraqi Kurds. In 1975, the Iraqis launched an offensive into Iran using tanks, though the Iranians defeated them. Several other attacks took place; however, Iran had the world's fifth most powerful military at the time and easily defeated the Iraqis with its air force. Some 1,000 people died on the course of the 1974-75 clashes in the Shatt al-Arab region. As a result, Iraq decided against continuing the war, choosing instead to make concessions to Tehran to end the Kurdish rebellion. In the 1975 Algiers Agreement, Iraq made territorial concessions‚Äîincluding the Shatt al-Arab waterway‚Äîin exchange for normalised relations. In return for Iraq recognising that the frontier on the waterway ran along the entire thalweg, Iran ended its support of Iraq's Kurdish guerrillas. Aftermath In March 1975, Iraq signed the Algiers Accord in which it recognized a series of straight lines closely approximating the thalweg (deepest channel) of the waterway, as the official border, in exchange for which Iran ended its support of the Iraqi Kurds.Abadan , Sajed, Retrieved on March 16, 2009. Five years later, on 17 September 1980, Iraq suddenly abrogated the Algiers Protocol following the Iranian revolution. Saddam Hussein claimed that the Islamic Republic of Iran refused to abide by the stipulations of the Algiers Protocol and, therefore, Iraq considered the Protocol null and void. Five days later, the Iraqi army crossed the border.

The Bank f√ºr Menschen ohne Bank as a socially oriented bank is run exclusively by volunteers from Erste Bank and the Sparkassen group and does not aim for any profits. Business purpose and accounts management The purpose of Die Zweite Sparkasse is to provide banking services to clients in financial problem situations. Only people referred to Zweite Sparkasse via one of the cooperating advisory organisations (see Partner organisations) are accepted as clients. On the basis of this recommendation, the new client is provided with an account, initially for a three years term, on a credit basis only and not allowing any overdrafts. The account is debited with a so-called \\"account management charge\\" of ‚Ç¨ 9 per quarter, which is refunded to the client when they change to a conventional commercial bank and the second account is closed. Clients are given an ATM card free of charge which can enables them to make worldwide cashless payments using the Maestro system, and make withdrawals from or deposits into their account via the ATMs in the foyers of Erste Bank and the Sparkasse Money transfers and the setting up of standing orders are also free of charge. In addition to this Zweite Sparkasse also offers a \\"permanent account\\" to allow customers additional time to sort out their financial problems. In a cooperation with debt counselling services they also offer \\"managed accounts\\" from, which essential payments are made automatically. For these two accounts, the banking charges are ‚Ç¨ 9 in three months, which are not refundable to the customer. Upon request, customers can open a savings account with a better interest rate and a modified model of a s- Aufbau building society savings account. Further components of the account are the possibility of being given legal advice every three months, and if wanted a savings account at a better interest rate and a modified model of an s-Aufbau building society savings contract. In cooperation with Wiener St√§dtische Versicherung, all clients of Zweite are issued with a basic insurance package when opening an account This includes free legal advice every three months, a small accident insurance policy and, for a premium of ‚Ç¨ 3 per month, household insurance, which, as is customary in Austria, is combined with liability insurance for the customer and family members living in the household. Since 2008, Zweite Sparkasse has also been running workshops under the title \\"I ‚Ç¨AN\\", to advise small groups of apprentices on financial issues and inform them about possible debt traps. Legal organization Legally The Zweite Sparkasse is a fully-fledged bank. As described under \\"#Business purpose and account management\\", the difference between Zweite Sparkasse and conventional banks consists not only in its social orientation but also in the fact that it is managed exclusively by around 320 volunteers from Erste Bank and the savings bank group and is not aiming for profits. The current members of the unsalaried Management Board, are G√ºnter Benischek, Chairman of the Management Board, Gerda Holzinger-Burgstaller and Gerhard Ruprecht.

In 1947, she opened a studio in Vejle where she designed various clothes for women but soon specialized in the more profitable business of wedding dresses. In the mid-1960s, she moved into larger premises in Vejle, founding Denmark's first clothing factory. Established as Kjoleateliet LILLY (LILLY Dress Studio), over the years her firm became known simply as LILLY. On the occasion of its 50th anniversary in 1997, there were nine outlets in Denmark and 13 in Germany. Early life Born on 6 March 1918, Lilly Br√¶ndgaard Jacobsen was the daughter of the housepainter Martinus Julius Jacobsen (1892‚Äì1960) and Ane Kathrine Lauridsen (1898‚Äì1973), a seamstress. The eldest of six children, she was brought up in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen. When she was 14, after training as a seamstress and tailor, she was able to make a living altering clothes the clothes people brought to her, even during the war years where there was a shortage of materials. Career When she was 28, she opened her own studio in Vejle. At the time, she was living alone with her nine-year-old son from her first marriage but on 10 July 1947, she married Svend Br√¶ndgaard Hansen (1919‚Äì2000), a mason and carpenter, who owned the building housing her studio. Recognizing her special talents, her customers provided plenty of work. Initially, with the help of two seamstresses, she sewed coats, suits and everyday clothing but after 10 years she decided to concentrate on wedding dresses. Her increasing success stemmed from her concern for the individual, making each new bride look like a dream. As a result, she became known for her personalized style, making her a market leader in Denmark. She opened new stores manned by specially trained staff, relying on her husband to take care of the interiors. The slogan Det ender med en Lilly-model (It ends with a Lilly model) devised by her husband stuck over the years. In the late 1970s, production widened from wedding dresses to clothes for other festive occasions such as baptisms and confirmations. Around this time, the firm also began to develop its export business. By the time the firm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1997, there were nine stores in Denmark, 13 in Germany and a substantial export business with the United Kingdom and Japan. Her children and grandchildren increasingly took over the firm's operations but Br√¶ndgaard herself continued to carry out design work and serve on the board. After her husband's death on 19 April 2000, Lilly Br√¶ndgaard was supported by her large family. On her 90th birthday, she invited them all to a celebration at Vejle's Munkebjerg Hotel. By that time, her grandchildren Eva Dorthe, Anne Kathrine and Bettina had become responsible for running the business. Lilly Br√¶ndgaard Hansen died on 21 May 2009, leaving three children, seven grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

Miller helped found Connellan Airways as well as Argadargada and Hamilton Downs Stations.  Early life  Miller was born in 1915 in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of Septimus and Helen Miller and he attended Xavier College as a young man where he became friends with Sam Calder whom he would remain friends with for the rest of his life. After he left college he made friends with Edward Connellan, another man who would become a huge part of his life and he introduced him to Calder. When World War II broke out Miller and Calder immediately volunteered for the RAAF but first flew to Alice Springs to help Connellan establish Connellan Airways; which Miller helped finance (on a secured loan basis), with the assistance of his wealthy grandfather Henry Miller. Miller, with the other staff, helped build the Connellan hangar and construct the airstrips and flight paths.  World War II  Miller was called up early in the war, initially as a pilot instructor and then as a pilot on a Catalina squadron based in the Top End. In this squadron Miller once flew 11 hours of an 18 hour flight on only one engine after the aircraft had been severely damaged by Japanese air-aircraft fire at Kavieng, Papua New Guinea. The navigational instruments had also being damaged and the crew had to jettison fuel and ammunition as they flew over enemy territory through heavy rain. For this event Miller was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for 'bravery in combat'.  Life in the Northern Territory  Post-war Miller moved to Alice Springs to work again with Connellan, where he flew the Wyndham mail runs. In 1947, on a trip to England to purchase two Rapide aircraft's, Miller met and married Anne Fletcher at Yeovil in Somerset and following their marriage the two flew the planes home. This was a difficult trip as fuel had to be left a aerodromes apart across Europe and Asia and the planes had no radios. They reached Alice Springs on 6 May 1948. In 1951 Miller, alongside Milton Willick, established Argadargada Station north east of Alice Springs. They had a difficult time with the property, losing 1,300 head of cattle in 1953-54 to gidgee poisoning. In 1954 Calder joined the partnership and became the manager before they sold the station in 1964. Miller also bought a share of Hamilton Downs Station in 1952 and built a new homestead, he eventually acquired sole ownership in 1968. In 1972 Miller donated the ruins and site of the old Hamilton Downs homestead to the Apex Club of Central Australia, who turned it in to Hamilton Downs Youth Camp, which officially opened on 11 March 1978. Miller died after a long illness in 1990 and is buried at the Alice Springs Garden Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and their four children; Helen, Andrew, Jacinta and Paul.

He is a member of the French Academy of sciences and Professor Emeritus at the University of Poitiers.  Course  He began his career in secondary education at the Lyc√©e Gay-Lussac in Limoges (1959-1964). In charge of teaching natural sciences, he also undertook research on the Solanaceae conductive device at the university scientific college in this city. He developed a microautoradiography method to locate soluble radioactive molecules in plant tissues with unprecedented precision at the time, which enabled him to be admitted to the CNRS (attach√© and then research fellow) from 1964 to 1970. He supported his doctorate at the University of Paris in 1968. He was appointed lecturer (2nd class professor) at the University of Lille 1 in 1970 and then 1st class professor at the University of Poitiers in 1975. He entered the exceptional class in 1987.  Scientific work  It is well known that cambium produces wood on its inner side and secondary phloem on its outer side. However, various families of advanced plants are characterized by the presence of an internal phloem located on the periphery of the bone marrow and even, sometimes, by the presence of a phloem included in the wood, in fact supernumerary phloem whose functions were not well known. During his thesis, Jean-Louis Bonnemain showed that the external phloem and supernumerary phloem of Solanaceae form a complex network with junctions at precise levels and highlighted their specific function in supplying nutrients to precise plant organs.JL Bonnemain, ¬´ Sur l'anatomie et la physiologie de l'appareil conducteur des Solanac√©es ¬ª, Th√®se d'Etat Sc.

Fossil remains of Targaryendraco dated back about 132 million years ago. Discovery and naming In July 1984, amateur paleontologist Kurt Wiedenroth discovered a fragmentary pterosaur skeleton in the clay pit of Engelbostel at the southern edge of the city of Hannover. In 1990, Rupert Wild described the find as a new species of Ornithocheirus: Ornithocheirus wiedenrothi. The specific name honors Wiedenroth as discoverer. Wild considered the skeleton to lie evolutionary between Ornithocheirus compressirostris (now the holotype of Lonchodectes) and Ornithocheirus giganteus (now the holotype of Lonchodraco).Wild, R. 1990. \\"Pterosaur remains (Reptilia, Pterosauria) from the Lower Cretaceous (Hauterivian) of Hannover (Lower Saxony)\\". Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie, Abhandlungen, 181: 241‚Äì254 O. compressirostris was at the time seen as the type species of Ornithocheirus, but it was meanwhile shown that the correct type species is O. simus. The holotype, SMNS 56628, was found in rocks of the Stadthagen Formation dating from the earliest Hauterivian, about 132 million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton with lower jaws. It contains the front and the rear of the symphysis of the lower jaws, a right articular, a rib piece, the distal ends of a left radius and ulna, the proximal and distal end of a left third metacarpal and a piece of a phalanx, probably the first of the left third finger. The fossil is part of the collection of the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart. It is the most complete pterosaur specimen from the Cretaceous of Germany. In their study of 2010, Fletcher & Salisbury argued for O. wiedenrothi to be an ornithocheirid closely related to the then unnamed Aussiedraco and another pterosaur specimen from the Cretaceous of Australia.Fletcher, T.L. & Salisbury, S.W., 2010. \\"New pterosaur fossils from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) of Queensland, Australia\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 30(6): 1747-1759. DOI:10.1080/02724634.2010.521929 In 2013, Ford reported it to be a species of Lonchodectes.Ford, T.L., 2013. \\"Will the real Lonchodectes fly in?\\", Short Communications/International Symposium on Pterosaurs - Rio Ptero 2013, 65-67. In a study of the same year, Rodrigues & Kellner concluded that it wasn't Ornithocheirus, and was also not part of their newly erected genus Lonchodraco. In 2019, Abel et al. argued it to be potential new genus of lonchodectid.Abel, P., Hornung, J.J., Kear, B.P. & Sachs, S. 2019, \\"Reassessment of the enigmatic pterosaur ‚ÄòOrnithocheirus‚Äô wiedenrothi from the Lower Cretaceous of Northern Germany\\", Journal of Morphology 280: 73-74. doi:10.1002/jmor.21003 Later in 2019, P√™gas et al. assigned O. wiedenrothi as the type species of Targaryendraco. The generic name, which is formed from combining the name \\"Targaryen\\" with the Latin word draco and literally means \\"Targaryen dragon\\", refers to the fictional House Targaryen (who ride dragons and use them as heraldry) from the popular epic fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire. The authors chose the name because the now black-colored bones of the fossil resemble the fictional dragons in the novels.P√™gas, R.V., Holgado, B., Leal, M.E.C., 2019. \\"Targaryendraco wiedenrothi gen. nov. (Pterodactyloidea, Pteranodontoidea, Lanceodontia) and recognition of a new cosmopolitan lineage of Cretaceous toothed pterodactyloids\\", Historical Biology, 1‚Äì15. doi:10.1080/08912963.2019.1690482 Description In 2019, the describing authors abstained from giving a size estimate, in view of the fragmentary nature of the fossil. They estimated the wingspan of the most closely related species at . They indicated a single distinguishing trait. It is an autapomorphy, a unique derived character. The symphysis of the lower jaws has at the midline of its front an odontoid, or tooth-like, process, formed by a confluence of the side ridges of the occlusal groove, in the top surface of the joint dentaries. Phylogeny In 2019, Targaryendraco was placed within the Lanceodontia in an entirely new clade called Targaryendraconia, and was more precisely a member of the family Targaryendraconidae. In the latter clade it formed a polytomy with Aussiedraco and Barbosania. Below is a cladogram following P√™gas et al. (2019). In the analysis, they placed Targaryendraco in the clade Targaryendraconia as the sister taxon of Aussiedraco and Barbosania, within the more inclusive group Ornithocheirae.

Myname 2nd Mini Album peaked at number three South Korea's national Gaon Album Chart, shifting over 4,500 units domestically since its release. Background and music structure Myname released Myname 3rd Single Album and its lead single \\"Day by Day\\" on October 11, 2013. After concludng domestic promotions, the group's focus shifted to the Japanese music market; it resulted in a gap of one year and four months between the release of their previous single album and Myname 2nd Mini Album. Myname was given several tracks while recording new music, including \\"Too Very So Much\\". The song was not intended to be a single and the members had reservations over its unusual title, but they concluded that it was a \\"fun\\" song and decided it was the best candidate to serve as a lead single. Sonically, Myname 2nd Mini Album ranges from electronic music to balladry. With its foundation in hip hop, \\"Too Very So Much\\" describes a man incapable of dealing with being in love. The track incorporates a \\"groovy\\" drum coupled with a prominent \\"funky\\" bassline. \\"Broken Watch\\" is a \\"mournful\\" ballad.

He has been a member of the French Academy of sciences since 2017.  Biography  Alain Ch√©dotal studied biology at the Lyc√©e Clemenceau (Nantes) and joined the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon in 1988. He is moving into Neuroscience research after an internship in Dr. Edith Hamel's laboratory at the Montreal Neurological Institute (Canada), where he will also spend a year as a cooperator. Back in France, he enrolled in a PhD thesis in the Inserm team of Dr Constantino Sotelo at the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital and Pierre et Marie Curie University (currently Sorbonne University). He will study the migration of neurons in mouse embryos and the development of connections between the brain stem and the cerebellum. He joined Dr. Corey Goodman's laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley (USA) for a post-doctoral fellowship where he contributed to the identification of new receptors involved in axon guidance and various diseases, including cancers. Alain Ch√©dotal was recruited at Inserm in 1997 and set up his own team first at the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, then on the Jussieu campus, before joining the Institut de la Vision in 2008 (Inserm, CNRS, Sorbonne University, H√¥pital des Quinze-Vingts). During his career, Alain Ch√©dotal acquired multidisciplinary experience in Neuroanatomy, Experimental Embryology, Genetics, Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Imaging. In 2018, Alain Ch√©dotal is coordinating Inserm's transversal HuDeCA research programme, which aims to establish the cellular mapping of the human embryo. He is a member of the organizing committee of the permanent exhibition \\"Cerveau\\" at the Cit√© des sciences et de l'industrie.  Scientific contributions  Since his thesis, Alain Ch√©dotal has been interested in the development of neurons (called commissuraux) whose axons interconnect the right and left halves of the brain. These neurons allow 3D vision, the localization of sounds in space, the coordination of muscle contraction during movement, especially during walking. Their abnormal development is at the origin of neurological diseases such as mirror movements or HGPPS, a rare disease (mutation of the ROBO3 gene) that combines severe scoliosis and strabismus In a series of articles published over the past 20 years, Alain Ch√©dotal has identified some of the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling axon guidance and neuron migration in several brain regions. His team is also studying the evolution of axonal guidance mechanisms. His recent work has called into question the existence of a chemotropism of commissural axons, one of the dogmas in the field. He has recently demonstrated that certain guidance molecules are key regulators of normal and pathological angiogenesis, and that blocking these signals could potentially be used to treat neovascular eye diseases. His team also develops projects on the regeneration and repair of the optic nerve and cornea. Alain Ch√©dotal's laboratory has developed an innovative technique for three-dimensional imaging by optical cutting of thick, whole samples (mouse embryos, postnatal brain) made transparent using organic solvents and imaged with a light-sheet microscope. This method revolutionizes and facilitates the way in which the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, but also of all tissues, can be studied. He applied this method to the study of human embryonic and foetal development and began to build the first 3D cellular atlas of human embryonic development.  Honours and Awards  Alain Ch√©dotal has been a member of EMBO since 2019, of the Academia Europaea since 2016 and of the French Academy of sciences since 2017 and is currently President of the Scientific Council of the Foundation for Medical Research.

The Ch√¢teau de Chalencon is a feudal monument situated in the hamlet of Chalencon, about 1 kilometre north east of the village of Saint-Andr√©-de- Chalencon, in the Haute-Loire d√©partement, in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region of France.Ministry of Culture: Ruines du ch√¢teau History It is the birthplace of the illustrious Chalencon family, later allied with the Polignacs, one of the most important of Velay. In the Middle Ages, Chalencon was a strategic site on the route between Velay and Forez. The castle was built in the 10th century to control the route, and particularly the pont du Diable (Devil's Bridge) below the castle which was the sole crossing point of the Ance and subject to a toll.\\"VESTIGES DU CH√ÇTEAU DE CHALENCON\\", Petit Fut√©. Retrieved 20 November 2019. The castle was best known for its battle between Napoleon III's army and the Prussian Captain Herlter. It is said that 100 men were killed in this battle (known as the \\"battle against life\\"); the hero of this battle was Belotus de Veyrac, a noble and Count of Veyrac. The battle was brought to the screen by a young director. Today, to celebrate the battle, on June 28, many people gather on the site. There is a controversy because the niches are the work of the architects of Viollet-le-Duc, a medieval site restorer under Napoleon III. Given the location of the tower, it was more likely a flat tower where a fire was maintained during the misty winter nights so that merchants and pilgrims could spot each other. It should not be forgotten that Chalencon was above all a commercial centre for which crossing of the Devil's Bridge was subject to a toll. Description The remains of the Ch√¢teau de Chalencon are on the summit of a rocky outcrop dominating the Ance river, consisting of three terraces at different levels, of which one, to the west, overlooks the village. There is a keep, a round fortified tower at the top with crenellations, two corner turrets, partly rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century, and some windows from the end of the 13th century. The castle was definitively abandoned around 1600. It has been listed as a monument historique since 1913. The chapel seems to date from the end of the 11th century, with alterations in later times including the construction of a large window in the 15th century.No√´l Thiollier, L'architecture religieuse √† l'√©poque romane dans l'ancien dioc√®se du Puy, p.93-94, de R.

Early history  Private dances and balls in small halls around Brisbane eventually gave way to a larger audience experience, particularly after World War I and the advent of jazz music. Exhibition week was one of the most popular weeks in the city's dance calendar, as rural visitors came into Brisbane for the Brisbane Exhibition held in August each year and the event was commemorated with a public holiday. All styles of dance were available in Brisbane and the variety of arenas available made it possible for dancers to choose the venue they could best afford to attend. Most venues were located near train, tram or bus stations, mostly in the inner city. With the advent of talking motion pictures and the popularity of film musicals throughout the 1930s, people were keen to emulate their film idols such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. During World War II there was likely to be somewhere to dance at least three times a week, when almost 1 million United States military personnel were stationed on the east coast of Australia during the war in the Pacific. Television broadcasts commenced in Australia in 1956 and began to make inroads on film attendance and to affect popular culture. After 1957, music changed with the advent of rock and roll and promoters brought in acts from overseas to appeal to modern tastes. Dance styles changed from the ballroom or modern styles featured in the 1920s and 1930s, jitterbug of the WW2 era to rock and roll of the 1950s. Some of the international acts which toured Brisbane dance halls included Buddy Holly, Bill Haley and others. Clubs, discos and other venues thereafter became the standard musical venue for dances. Many of the venues previously used for dances were demolished.  Blue Moon  This dance hall was in a wharf adjacent to the Victoria Street Bridge at South Brisbane and was designed by architect Ronald Martin Wilson. It offered weekly dances from 1935 until the 1950s. However it mainly functioned as a roller skating rink as it had a steel floor. This building was demolished to provide for abutments to the new bridge. A neon sign near the Trocadero Dansant recalls the history of the Blue Moon in the area.  Brisbane City Hall  Brisbane City Hall Auditorium stage and organs City Hall, designed by architects Hall and Prentice opened in 1930 in Adelaide Street, Brisbane. It is located next to King George Square. It was regularly used for balls and dances and continues to be leased for functions to this day.  Caledonian Society Hall  The Caledonian Society and Burns Club occupied a number of buildings in Brisbane, including Centennial Hall before settling at 46 Elizabeth Street, Brisbane. The hall was leased out for use by many groups for weekly dances. This building has since been demolished to make way for new buildings on the present site facing the Myer Centre.  Cantwell Ballroom  The Addie Cantwell Palais Ballroom opened in the 1930s at 436 Adelaide Street, Petrie Bight on the site of the dance hall previously known as the Ritz. It mainly functioned as a ballroom dancing studio, the largest in Australia at the time. In addition to classes in old time and modern ballroom, carnival nights and dances were scheduled weekly. The Cantwell Ballroom was a popular venue during World War II, with American GIs. The building has been demolished.  Centennial Hall (Brisbane)  Centennial Hall opened in 1888 and was located in Adelaide Street, between Albert and Edward Streets (where the present day Reserve Bank of Australia building is located). Its entrance faced the Brisbane Arcade. Its remodel with a design by Lange Leopold Powell in the 1920s emphasised Art Deco decoration and the building included marble stairs and a flat auditorium floor which could seat 700 people when not in use as a dance hall. It had a gallery area which could also seat 300 people if a floor show was playing that evening. Shops operated in the lower level of the building. It operated as a skating rink in the 1880s and music hall venue in the 1890s. It was operated as a bioscopy theatre from 1906-1919 and a vaudeville venue from 1940-1941. It became known as the Cocoanut Grove Ballroom after 1941, and was popular with US soldiers. Fire damaged the building in April 1942. Cocoanut Grove later became known as Birdland. Programs from productions at the Centennial are held in the Fryer Library of the University of Queensland.  Cloudland Ballroom, also known as Luna Park  Cloudland Cloudland opened in 1940, designed by T.H. Eslick, who had established Luna Park in Melbourne. It was situated in Bowen Hills at the top of a hill. A funicular railway ran from the main road at Breakfast Creek up the hill to provide easy access to the hall. This railway was dismantled in 1967 and replaced with a car park. The building itself had a distinctive parabolic laminated roof arch 18 metres high, which made it visible across Brisbane. It did not operate between 1940-1942 when Eslick abandoned the project. The U.S. military used the building during World War II. After the war the floors were replaced by the military and featured one inch tongue and groove boards that were not nailed. The dance floor in particular sat on heavy metal coil springs which provided a well sprung experience for dancers. Mya Winters and Francis Rouch purchased the building and it re-opened 1947. Famous guests to the hall included Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh during their tour of Australia in 1948. It was a concert venue in the 1950s, and featured Australian and international performers such as Buddy Holly, Johnnie Ray, Paul Anka, Jerry Lee Lewis and others. In the 1960s a number of midnight to dawn dances were offered during long weekends or other holiday occasions. The interior of the building featured decorative columns, domed skylights and chandeliers and generous curtains. It offered private alcoves for resting that sat above the dance floor area. Cloudland was demolished in 1982 in controversial circumstances, to make way for an apartment complex. Doctor Carver Club  A services club for African American soldiers was established in 100 Grey Street, South Brisbane opposite the train station, during World War II. Regular dances were held in the club. The building has since been demolished. The club's history was celebrated in the play, Boundary Street (2011).  Finneys Auditorium  Finneys department store at 196 Queen Street (where the present day David Jones department store is located) featured a room on their fifth floor that could seat 700 and was offered for dances.  Lennon's Hotel  Lennon's Hotel was originally situated in George Street but was rebuilt in 1941 to a design by Emil Sodersteen, and again in 1972 at its present site in Queen Street. Lennon's offered a small dance floor from the 1920s and due to its status as the town's leading hotel, attracted celebrities visiting Brisbane for performances and other events. The hotel was largely taken over by the US military during World War II.  Ozanam House  Ozanam House, the St Vincent de Paul Hall in Gotha Street, Fortitude Valley opened in 1937, built to a design by J. P. Donoghue and offered another venue for dancing.  Queensland Jive Club  Jack Busteed ran a dance studio from 1948 in a building in Post Office Square in Adelaide Street and demonstrated jive. It had a membership of over 1000 people. 100 dancers would come to the dance nights.  Railway Institute  The Railway Institute in Edward Street above Central Station was another popular venue for dancing.  South Brisbane Tech  The South Brisbane Tech or South Brisbane Municipal Library and Technical Institute was built in 1881 to serve as the South Brisbane Post Office. It was located between Stanley and Dock Streets. A concert hall toward the rear of the building offered balls and dances weekly, operating from 1906-1973. It now houses the Griffith University Film School. It is a heritage listed building.  Trocadero Dansant  Masonic Ball at the Trocadero in Brisbane, 1941 (9312686282) Billo Smith's Dance Band at the Trocadero Dance Hall, Brisbane, ca. 1931 (9234368037) The Trocadero Dansant opened in 1923 as a high class dance hall in South Brisbane, taking advantage of the popularity for jazz style music particular to the 1920s. It was situated in Melbourne Street facing the railway terminus. It had been designed by architects Hall and Prentice. It featured a painted ceiling, greenery and purple and blue electric lighting. A central chandelier, much like an early disco ball, directed light to the corners of the room. The dance hall provided 52 alcoves for patrons to rest and socialise, featuring mission oak furniture. 300 palm trees were used in window boxes and in hallways to provide a tropical effect. 1200 dancers could be accommodated on the floor which was polished to a high standard. It featured an orchestra and offered regular competitions tied to movies as well as beauty pageants. Billo Smith was one of the most popular band leaders of the time. The Trocadero closed after World War II, as patrons sought out the new Cloudland dance hall. It was demolished in the 1950s to make way for the construction of the rail line connecting South Brisbane station to Roma Street station. A sign located in Melbourne Street, South Brisbane records the location of the Hall. Selected programs from events at the Trocadero are held in the Fryer Library at the University of Queensland.

With a total of 36 professorships and about 3,700 students in 12 study courses, the Department of Computer Science is the largest department of the university. The department shapes the two research profile areas \\"Cybersecurity (CYSEC)\\" and \\"Internet and Digitization (InDi)\\" of the university. Like the history of the university, the history of the department is shaped by pioneers. The beginnings of computer science, artificial intelligence and business informatics in Germany go back to the department.  History   Beginnings of computer science in Germany  Staff of the Institute for Practical Mathematics (1960) In 1928, Alwin Walther was appointed professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. Walther established the Institute for Practical Mathematics (IPM) there, which was part of the Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. In Germany, the beginnings of computer science go back to this institute. The institute was concerned with automating computing using mechanical and electromechanical devices and developing machines that could be used to solve mathematical problems. One of the earliest results was the System Darmstadt slide rule, which was widely used in mechanical engineering. Another development was an electromechanical integration system. After the Second World War, the institute concentrated increasingly on the development of electronic computer systems. Due to the reputation that TH Darmstadt had at that time in automatic computation research, the first congress on the subject of computer science (electronic calculators and information processing) held in German-speaking countries with international participation took place at TH Darmstadt in October 1955. The Darmstadt Electronic Calculator (DERA), which was completed in 1959, was created with the help of the German Research Foundation (DFG). At that time, the computer capacity was unique in Europe. Two decades before the invention of programming languages, algorithms were tested on the computing station and successfully used to process problems from industry. In 1956, the first students at DERA were able to deal with the problems of automatic calculating machines. At the same time, the first programming lectures and practical courses were offered at TH Darmstadt. In 1957, Walther made sure that TH Darmstadt got an IBM 650, which was the most powerful computer at that time. Thus TH Darmstadt was also the first university in Germany with a mainframe computer. In 1961, in response to Walther's efforts, the German Computer Center (DRZ) was founded in Darmstadt, the first mainframe computer center in Germany with which TH Darmstadt entered into a cooperation to train mathematical-technical assistants. Electrical engineering also had a major influence on computer science at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt). In 1964, Robert Piloty was appointed to the chair of data technology at TH Darmstadt. In the 1960s, Germany lacked competitiveness in the field of data processing. To counteract this, the Federal Committee for Scientific Research adopted a programme for the promotion of research and development in the field of data processing for public tasks on 26 April 1967. The advisory board, which consisted mainly of representatives of universities and non-university research institutions, was responsible for the implementation of the programme. At the seventh meeting of the advisory board on 15 November 1967, Karl Ganzhorn, who at the time was responsible for research and development at IBM Germany, signalled the problems of industry in finding skilled personnel. The director of the Institute for Information Processing at TH Darmstadt, Piloty, pointed out that the German universities were responsible for training qualified personnel. As a result, a committee was formed, which was chaired by Piloty. The committee formulated recommendations for the training of computer scientists, which provided for the establishment of a course of studies in computer science at several universities and technical colleges. At TH Darmstadt Piloty worked with Winfried Oppelt on a study plan \\"Computer Science\\", which was characterized by engineering science. There was already another curriculum with the name \\"Diplom-Ingenieur Informatik (Mathematik)\\", which came from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and provided for a stronger emphasis on software engineering. However, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering was the driving force, which is why in the same year the first computer science course of study in Germany was established at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering on the basis of Pilotys and Oppelts study regulations. The first diploma thesis was written in 1971, the first doctoral thesis in 1975 and the first habilitation in 1978. In the spring of 1969, Hartmut Wedekind and Robert Piloty had travelled through the USA together for several weeks to study the faculties of computer science there. On July 7, 1969, the Founding Committee for Computer Science (GAI) was established to constitute the Department of Computer Science. Later, the committee was replaced by a provisional department conference. This conference met for the first time on 15 May 1972, so that on that day the Department of Computer Science was officially established. Wedekind became its first dean. Piloty was awarded the Konrad Zuse Medal for his achievements in 1989.Software AG logoIn 1969, graduates of TH Darmstadt founded Software AG. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in Europe. One of the founders was Peter Schnell, who was chairman of Software AG for many years and today, with his Software AG Foundation, is one of the largest donors in Germany.  Business Informatics  The history of business informatics goes back to Peter Mertens, who studied industrial engineering at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt). His habilitation thesis was the first habilitation thesis on business informatics in the German-speaking world. In 1968, Peter Mertens was appointed to the first chair in the German-speaking countries focusing on economic data processing at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. In the same year, Hartmut Wedekind, former systems consultant at IBM Germany, represented the Chair of Business Administration at TH Darmstadt for the first time. Two years later, he was appointed to the Chair of Business Administration and Data Processing at TH Darmstadt. Wedekind worked on database systems and their operational applications and, as early as 1971, headed the \\"Data Management Systems I\\" research group, which dealt with databases in the operational context. It was the first larger research group to deal with the topics of business informatics. In 1976, TH Darmstadt introduced the first course of studies in business informatics in Germany.  Artificial Intelligence  Wolfgang Bibel (2006) The history of artificial intelligence goes hand in hand with the appointment of Wolfgang Bibel, who had been rejected by professors at the Technical University of Munich because they did not believe in the future of artificial intelligence. In the winter semester 1985/1986 Bible represented the chair at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt) as deputy professor for the first time, to which the university later appointed him. Hans-J√ºrgen Hoffmann, Professor for Programming Languages and Translators, was involved in the deputy professorship. He accepted the call to TH Darmstadt on 1 October 1988 and became Professor of Intellectics at the Department of Computer Science. Bible is one of the founders of artificial intelligence in Germany and Europe. He built up the necessary institutions, conferences and scientific journals and provided the necessary research programmes to establish the field of artificial intelligence. For the academic year 1991/1992 he took over the office as Dean of the Department of Computer Science of TH Darmstadt. During this time he chaired three appointment commissions. Among them were Oskar von Stryk and Karsten Weihe. In his time, he also built up his research group and made the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt) one of the leading universities for artificial intelligence worldwide. The most outstanding scientific project was the National Priority Program Deduction, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The project led to Germany assuming a leading position in artificial intelligence. He has been professor emeritus since 2004. He gave his farewell lecture on February 13, 2004.Bibel, Wolfgang. (2004). Intellektik und Informatik im Konzert der Wissenschaften. 10.13140/RG.2.2.31867.31520. By 2017, twenty-five of his doctoral students or staff had become professors, so that the majority of today's German AI researchers are graduates of TU Darmstadt. For his achievements he was honored by the Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik as one of the ten influential minds in German AI history. He was also one of the first Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). The Centre for Cognitive Science (CCS) was founded at TU Darmstadt by Constantin Rothkopf, Professor of Psychology of Information Processing. Rothkopf became its founding director. Research groups from various disciplines work at the Centre. At the same time Kristian Kersting, Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, founded the initiative Artificial Intelligence at TU Darmstadt (AI‚Ä¢DA), a unique model that coordinates different research groups to advance the development of artificial intelligence. Kersting was awarded in 2019 for his scientific achievements as a Fellow of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI) and as a Fellow of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS). In 2019, the TU Darmstadt was selected as a founding location of ELLIS with the aim of establishing a top AI research institute. The decision, made by international scientists, was based on the scientific excellence in the field.  IT Security  Johannes Buchmann (2016) In 1996, Johannes Buchmann was appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Computer Science. The appointment is regarded as the birth of IT security at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt). Three years later, Darmstadts universities and research institutions founded the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (CAST), the largest network for cyber security in the German-speaking world. It was initially a forum, which was transformed into an independent association in 2003. The second professorship for IT security followed in 2001. Claudia Eckert, who also headed Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT) from 2001 to 2011, was appointed Professor of Information Security at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. The professorship was endowed by the Horst G√∂rtz Foundation. IT security was institutionalized in 2002 with the founding of the Darmstadt Center for IT Security (DZI), which became the Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt (CASED) in 2008. Buchmann and Eckert were in charge of the project. Buchmann was the founding director of CASED. In 2010, Michael Waidner became director of Fraunhofer SIT. The European Center for Security and Privacy by Design (EC SPRIDE) was founded in 2011 as a result of the efforts of Buchmann and Waidner. CASED and EC SPRIDE were part of LOEWE, the research excellence program of the state of Hesse. In 2012, Intel established the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Secure Computing at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. It was the first collaborative research institute for IT security that Intel established outside the United States. Two years later, the German Research Foundation (DFG) established the Collaborative Research Centre \\"CROSSING - Cryptography-Based Security Solutions\\" at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, which deals with cryptography-based security solutions. The first speaker of CROSSING was Buchmann. In 2015, CASED and EC SPRIDE merged to form today's Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRISP), the largest research institution for IT security in Europe. In the same year, the German Research Foundation established the Graduate School for Privacy and Trust for Mobile Users on the initiative of Max M√ºhlh√§user. One year later, the Federal Ministry of Finance decided to make the Darmstadt region an outstanding location for the digital transformation of the economy. The Federal Ministry of Finance has established the centers \\"Digital Hub Cybersecurity\\" and \\"Digital Hub FinTech\\" in the region, which are to serve the networking of companies, research institutions and start-ups. CRISP was upgraded to the National Research Center for Applied Cyber Security on January 1, 2019. Johannes Buchmann and his team founded the field of post-quantum cryptography internationally. In a worldwide competition organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the XMSS signature method developed by Buchmann and his team became the first international standard for post-quantum cryptography in 2018. XMSS is the first future-proof and practical signature procedure with minimal security requirements. Buchmann was awarded the Konrad Zuse Medal in 2017 for his achievements.Buchmann J., Dahmen E., H√ºlsing A.

Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 7071. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg  Fraunhofer Institute in Darmstadt  The history of the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT) dates back to 1961, when the German Computer Center (DRZ) was founded in Darmstadt on the initiative of Alwin Walther. At that time, the German Data Center was equipped with one of the most powerful mainframe computers in Germany, making it the first mainframe data center in Germany. Particularly of the DRZ was that it could be used by universities and scientific mechanisms for research purposes. As the ARPANET became more and more widespread, communication between the machines became the focus of research at the DRZ. In 1973, the DRZ merged with other research institutions in this field to form the Gesellschaft f√ºr Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung (GMD). The Society founded the Institute for Remote Data Transmission, which was renamed the Institute for Telecooperation Technology in 1992. Under the direction of Heinz Thielmann, the Institute increasingly dealt with IT security issues and with the advent of the Internet, IT security became increasingly important, so that in 1998 it was renamed the Institute for Secure Telecooperation. In 2001 the GMD merged with the Fraunhofer Society. In 2004, the Institute for Secure Telecooperation became the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT). The founding director was Claudia Eckert, who was also Professor for Information Security at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.  Graphical Data Processing  Jos√© Luis Encarna√ßƒÅo (2014) In 1975, Jos√© Luis Encarna√ß√£o founded the Research Group Graphic Interactive Systems (GRIS) at the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. In 1977 he and his research group introduced the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) as the first ISO standard for computer graphics (ISO/IEC 7942). GKS allows graphics applications to run device-independently. Images can be created and manipulated and the images were portable for the first time. In 1984 Encarna√ß√£o founded the Center for Computer Graphics in Darmstadt. A working group resulting from this cooperation was taken over by the Fraunhofer Society and the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research (Fraunhofer IGD) was founded in 1987. The founding director of the Fraunhofer IGD was Jos√© Luis Encarna√ß√£o. The institute was one of the first research institutes to deal with internet technologies. Jos√© Luis Encarna√ß√£o was awarded the Konrad Zuse Medal for his achievements in 1997.  Research   Research priorities  The research focuses of the department include: * Computational Engineering and Robotics * Data Science * IT Security * Massively Parallel Software Systems * Networks and Distributed Systems * Visual Computing  Research grants  According to the funding report 2018 of the German Research Foundation (DFG), the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt received the highest number of competitive grants in the field of computer science in the period under review from 2014 to 2016. In a competitive selection process, the DFG selects the best research projects from researchers at universities and research institutions and finances them.  Location  The Department of Computer Science is spread over several locations, but the buildings are located in or around the city center of Darmstadt.  Contests  Robot Argonaut at the ARGOS Challenge The search and rescue robot Hector (Heterogeneous Cooperating Team Of Robots) of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt competed in 2014 in the category \\"Rescue Robot\\" in the RoboCup, the oldest and world's largest competition for intelligent robots in various application scenarios, and took first place there. In 2017, the Argonaut robot, developed by a team led by Oskar von Stryk, won the ARGOS Challenge for intelligent inspection robots on oil and gas platforms, which the company Total S.A. had launched. The prize was half a million euros. Argonaut is a variant of Taurob tracker and the first fully autonomous, mobile inspection robot for oil and gas plants. In 2018, Hector competed at the World Robot Summit in Tokyo in the category \\"Plant Disaster Prevention Challenge\\" and won 1st place.

It was directed by Daniel Draper as a follow up to 2017 documentary Dennis Skinner: Nature of the Beast. The film \\"shows the Gala through narratives that represent the past, present and future of the event\\". Synopsis The film begins with a soaring introduction to County Durham, where we follow three rivers from the sea all the way to the Big Meeting itself. Following this, a short overview of the historical social changes in Europe in the mid 1800s, leading to the creation of many trade unions, including the Durham Miners' Association. This brief precis is important in establishing the history still felt at the Gala, and the passion which the film explores later on. The main narrative of the film follows four protagonists over the course of the 2018 Gala - from early morning until evening. There is Charlotte Austin, a young University student who, impassioned about politics since the 'Jeremy Corbyn movement', works during the holidays at the radical and left-wing People's Bookshop in Durham. Charlotte represents the future of the movement and speaks passionately about the Gala renewing her spirit to carry on the fight for workers' rights. The newly formed (in 2018) Women's Banner Group is another of the protagonists in the film, and they are seen marching proudly with their community created banner. Their spokeswoman, Laura Daly, speaks about how although women attended the Gala, there was nothing there celebrating their contribution to mining life and culture, so this banner was created to help begin to rectify this. The Banner Group are seen becoming particularly overwhelmed when their banner is blessed at Durham Cathedral, a special sign of recognition. Stephen Guy leads the traditional Sherburn Banner Group, proudly marching a banner with his father on, and explaining the pride and history associated with a traditional miners' banner. The remaining protagonist is Heather Ward, a member of the Durham Miners Association Brass Band. We see the band from rehearsal, throughout the march through the city and on to the Cathedral, where they get to perform yearly at the service. Heather explains the tradition of a band at the Gala, and the pride to be part of such an event. Thought the film, vignettes of historical and cultural importance highlight other topics that branch off from the Gala. These include the Durham Bannermakers, who have been making banners since the 1980s. Emma Shankland explains how making the banners is more than just putting paint on canvas, it is a piece of art that isn't made to be hung on a wall. There is community pride associated with each banner, and they can be used as a tool for cultural education. A segment on mining art (filmed at Auckland Mining Art Gallery) shows some of the paintings depicting mining life above and below ground, that were nearly lost before Robert McManners, amongst others, realised their value. Another segment is on the first film made about the Gala - a short film called Gala Day from 1963, directed by John Irvin. With no narrative or voice- over, this observational documentary was part of the Free Cinema Movement and was an inspiration for The Big Meeting. John Irvin himself describes his memories of the Gala and how his film came about. An important segment, that feeds in to the Women's Banner Group storyline, is that of the role of women. During the 1984-85 Miners Strike women played an important role in keeping communities going, running food banks, organising rallies and community hospitals. As Ross Forbes of the DMA states, \\"the involvement of women is that which sustains. But not only the Gala, but all of the heritage and culture that we wish to maintain\\". Although the Gala is a celebration of mining heritage, the film does not glorify mining. As director Daniel Draper stated in an interview with Film Hub North, \\"We made a conscious decision to show how mining was really an awful job - dangerous and exploitative - but that what those communities created was at times beautiful.\\" Accompanying shots of miners cramped underground, Heather Wood states \\"I love mining because I think it made me who I am, but I hate it because of what it did to my Dad and my Grandad.\\" Paul Mason comments how his Grandad \\"loved mining\\" but would be 'very glad' to learn that no-one has to go two miles underground in the dark and damp anymore. MPs Dennis Skinner, Richard Burgon, Jeremy Corbyn, Angela Raynor, historian Robert Colls, author Selina Todd and activist Margaret Aspinall are among contributors explaining the importance of the political speeches on the show field, the significance of the County Hotel, the moving Cathedral service and more. This multi-faceted, historical event is explored in depth and explores the unity and solidarity on show each year at the Durham Miners' Gala.

Pre-History  The presence of Catholic faithful of the Byzantine rite in Central Asia dates back to the 17th century, but was sporadic until the 20th century, when their number increased considerably due to the forced mass deportations carried out in the Stalinist era. From 1939 to 1953, some 150,000 faithful of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church were transferred to Central Asia: most of them were to Kazakhstan. About 150 priests were deported with the faithful, including the blessed martyrs Oleksiy Zarytskyi and Nykyta Budka, and the Servant of God Alexander Chira. After 1991, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union the activities of the Catholic Church, even of the Byzantine rite, became normal. Greek-Catholic parishes were erected in Karaganda, Pavlodar, Astana, Satbayev, Shiderty and Almaty: in addition to these parishes the Byzantine rite Catholics form a dozen communities, scattered in other places. In 1996 here was appointed by the Holy See an Apostolic Visitor, who was replaced in 2002 by Apostolic Delegate and depended from the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.

Founded in 2003 as the second team of town, after Liga III member Petrolul BrƒÉila, the club reached the third tier twice, now being the only active football club in the locality known for oil exploitation. History Golden years of football in Ianca (1969‚Äì2007) The history of professional football from Ianca started in 1969, with the foundation of Petrolul BrƒÉila, club that promoted for the first time in the Divizia C at the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season. After only one season the club changed its name in Petrolul Ianca BrƒÉila, in order to highlight the town where the home matches were played. Ianca is a well known place in Romania for oil exploitation, from there coming the name Petrolul (Oil in English) and the yellow and blue combination of colours, inspired by the one used by Petrolul Ploie»ôti or FlacƒÉra Moreni, other teams that represented towns in which the oil extraction was the main economical engine. Although launched harder in the Romanian football elite due to the smaller economic strength of the locality and the lower importance of the drilling rig, compared to Ploie»ôti or Moreni, Petrolul Ianca BrƒÉila had a brilliant journey in the late 1980s and with consistent developments during the 1990s. In 1987 \\"the Oilmen\\" promoted for the first time in the Divizia B, but were relegated after only one season, finishing last, then after four seasons spent in the third tier, Petrolul promoted again and this time it was the same, relegating after one season, being ranked 13th out of 18. This was going to be their last participation in the second tier, but the club near BrƒÉila continued to register important results in the third tier, where it was ranked second on three occasions: 1996, 1998 and 1999. Would be worth mentioning that the club changed again its name in 1994, returning to the name of Petrolul BrƒÉila, but continuing to dispute its home matches at Ianca. In the early 2000s, Iancanii were a common presence at the level of the Divizia C, making a last very good season and finishing second in 2005, then, after this result, things started to take a downturn and in 2007 Petrolul BrƒÉila withdrew from championship and was declared bankrupt. The fight for supremacy in town (2007‚Äìpresent) The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 took Petrolul Ianca BrƒÉila to dissolution and one of the new clubs from the city that tried to continue the football tradition was Viitorul Ianca. Founded on 14 March 2003, the white and burgundies fought hard for supremacy in the town against clubs such as CSO Ianca (sponsored by Town of Ianca) and Fortino Ianca (private club, sponsored by Fortino company). CSO promoted in the Liga III in 2007 but did not cope financially and was disbanded after only one season. In 2009 Viitorul promoted as well, also being reorganized administratively, reason for which the year 2009 appears on the logo of the club, but has relegated after one season spent at this level. The third team that tried to be the main team of the town, Fortino, won Liga IV ‚Äì BrƒÉila County in 2012, but subsequently lost the promotion play-off and was dissolved. With CSO and Fortino dissolved, Viitorul Ianca took its chance and started to impose itself as the new team of Ianca, finally being also supported by the town, both financially and emotionally and promoting back in the Liga III in 2019, when it won Liga IV ‚Äì BrƒÉila County and the promotion play-off match against Mausoleul MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, Vrancea County champions. Ground Viitorul Ianca plays its home matches on the »òtefan VrƒÉbioru Stadium in Ianca, with a capacity of 4,000 seats. The stadium was built in the 1980s and renovated in 2009 with the support of the Town of Ianca and the BrƒÉila County Youth and Sport Directorate. During the 2000s, the stadium was renamed as »òtefan VrƒÉbioru, in the honour of the footballer born in Ianca and who died in 1999 on the football pitch at the age of only 23, during a match between Rapid Bucure»ôti and Astra Ploie»ôti.

He was in charge of the police operation code-named Tiderider in response to street protests triggered by the extradition bill since June 2019.

Within the European Union (EU), these pension funds can vary throughout certain Member States due to differences in retirement ages in Europe, salaries and length of careers, labour and tax laws, and phases of reform. This form deferred compensation can be paid out regularly each month once the employee has retired. It is both beneficial for the employee by saving on taxation and social insurance payments and the employer to attract potential employees and to retain existing as an incentive. It is known as the ‚Äúsecond pillar‚Äù of a supplementary pension plan which includes the contribution of employers. This free movement of workers in the EU allows them to uphold their rights when moving to other Member States.  Background  Since prior to the post-World War II period, European countries embraced a Bismarckian pension system, first introduced in Germany, which allowed retirees to receive benefits from current workers. However, after this period nearly all of Europe had experienced a dramatic increase in life expectancy yet with a decreasing rate of fertility. Since the 1990s, European countries have made attempts to improve their pension systems through various multi-tier pension systems. This typically involved utilizing a combination of mandatory and voluntary schemes where both individuals and the government collectively put money into the system. In 2003, the European Commission created the International Occupational Pension Funds Directive (also referred to as the IORP Directive) to establish the fundamental requirements of offering occupational pension funds and its regulations. However, the IORP was since been revised in 2016 in response to financial crisis since 2008. In addition, pension funds have become one of the EU‚Äôs largest expenditures due to increasing pressures from the aging population throughout Europe. In 2011, the European Parliament called upon the Commission to encouraged more Member States to implement occupational pensions for a mix of both public (‚Äòfirst pillar‚Äô) and private (‚Äòsecond pillar‚Äô) pensions as another step to reform schemes for a more sustainable future. However, the current establishment of occupational pension funds still vary in size and approach across each Member State. Despite the various designs, occupational pension plans can be defined into two basic types: # Defined benefit (‚ÄòDB‚Äô) in which the employee benefit received is calculated through the length of employment under the employer and the specified salary maintained. # Defined contribution (‚ÄòDC‚Äô) where both the employee and employer generate regular contributions into an account. This type of plan is fully funded and are essentially accounts which experience tax-differed savings.  Reforms and Role of the EU  Since the early 2000s, numerous EU Member States have initiated pension reforms through the adjustment of age requirements and benefits received. These changes were a response to pressures from declining birth rates, increased life expectancies, and aging demographics. With the 2004 enlargement of the EU, ‚Äònew‚Äô Member States faced challenges to reform their previous pension systems to a market-based from the socialist system. However, smaller ‚Äònew‚Äô EU Member states, such as Cyprus and Slovenia, began to adopt mandatory occupational pension schemes. The reform changes made were through toughening conditions of eligibility for earlier retirement age, lessening public pension benefits received, and raising the age of retirement. In correspondence with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States were capable to reform and design their new pension systems. Private pension funds had become a cornerstone part of the EU programme.  The International Occupational Pension Funds Directive (IORP)  The International Occupational Pension Funds Directive was formulated to enhance EU pension funds to meet certain standards regarding financial aspects of occupational pension schemes. The revision of this framework for supplementary pension mobility encouraged the enactment of occupational pension funds through long-term investment. Below the revision‚Äôs goals included but not limited to: # Proper investment requirements to ensure sufficient funds. # Better transparency to each Member State and beneficiary through statements regarding funds received to be properly informed of rights. # Elimination of restrictions on occupational pension funds which operate cross borders. Through the revision, however, it still provides a general framework which is not required to be implemented by all EU Member States. Yet overall, the aim was to guide each institution into harmonization towards cross-border activity. The need for the revisions can be attributed towards the pressure for needing to have more retirement savings and occupational pensions due to aging populations and decline in fertility.  European Integration  One goal of the European Union can be described as creating an intra-European migration and eliminating restrictions on the mobility of workers. With this goal, originally regulations of pensions schemes were necessary to foster direct and positive integration. In 1998, the EU further became interested in regulations for occupational (supplementary) pension schemes with the Council Directive (98/49) which established principles to safeguard the pension rights of the movement of EU national workers, maintain equal treatment of EU nationals, and transfer benefits to other Member States. The European Commission is actively involved to area relating to occupational pension schemes in the EU. The DG Internal Market and Service was established to promote the internal market by facilitating cross- border cooperation in the EU with a basis of rules to follow by.  Effects from global financial and economic crisis  The global financial and economic crises following the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse enacted budgetary restrictions in the EU and created vulnerabilities for the pension systems across Member States. Both DB and DC plans were significantly affected by the 2008 crisis. On average, throughout countries in the EU with DB plans experienced at least a 10% decrease in benefit cuts. This showed that fully funded pension schemes could not entirely provide a reliable basis for benefits received after retirement.. Furthermore, during that time with the increase of unemployment made saving for retirement and receiving occupational pension funds more difficult. Workers who were nearby their retirement appeared to be affected as well by the crisis.

History  Development originally came out of the Cryptonets paper, demonstrating that artificial intelligence algorithms could be run on homomorphically encrypted data. It is open-source (under the MIT License) and written in standard C++ without external dependencies and so it can be compiled cross platform. An official .NET wrapper written in C# is available and makes it easier for .NET applications to interact with SEAL.  Features   Algorithms  Microsoft SEAL supports both asymmetric and symmetric (added in version 3.4) encryption algorithms.  Scheme types  Microsoft SEAL comes with two different homomorphic encryption schemes with very different properties: * BFV: The BFV scheme allows modular arithmetic to be performed on encrypted integers. For applications where exact values are necessary, the BFV scheme is the only choice. * CKKS: The CKKS scheme allows additions and multiplications on encrypted real or complex numbers, but yields only approximate results. In applications such as summing up encrypted real numbers, evaluating machine learning models on encrypted data, or computing distances of encrypted locations CKKS is going to be by far the best choice.  Compression  Data compression can be achieved by building SEAL with Zlib support. By default, data is compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm which achieves significant memory footprint savings when serializing objects such as encryption parameters, ciphertexts, plaintexts, and all available keys: Public, Secret, Relin (relinearization), and Galois. Compression can always be disabled.

There is a particular tradition of barrel ageing beer in Belgium, notably of lambic beers.The High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers. Lambiek. (in Dutch) Retrieved 21 April 2020. The first bourbon barrel- aged beers were produced in the United States in the early 1990s. Beers can be aged in barrels to achieve a variety of effects, such as imparting flavours from the wood (from tannins and lactones) or from the previous contents of the barrels, or causing a Brettanomyces fermentation. Oak remains the wood of choice, but other woods are in use as well. Chestnut, ash, poplar, cedar, acacia, cypress, redwood, pine, and even eucalyptus have been used for barrel- ageing with varying success. The flavours imparted by oak barrels differ widely depending on the oak species, the growing area, and how the wood has been treated. New oak barrels can be used for ageing beer, but they are not common due to high costs. Some flavours that new oak will contribute are wood, vanilla, dill, spice, and toastiness. History Lambics have been brewed in Belgium's Zenne Valley and Pajottenland since the 13th century. There were at least 300 lambic makers in the region in 1900, both in Brussels and in the countryside.All About Beer Magazine. IN SEARCH OF LAMBIC. Retrieved 21 April 2020.

Lambic beers of Belgium Kriek lambics - Mort Subite, De Cam, Hanssens, Boon, Oud Beersel and Girardin Lambics are fermented and aged in wooden barrels similar to those used to ferment wine. The microflora from the wood contribute to a spontaneous fermentation and brewing activity was concentrated on the colder months of the year to avoid spoilage. The barrels used by traditional Belgian lambic breweries can be up to 150 years old, and the lambic ageing process typically lasts from one to three years. Willem Van Herreweghen of Timmermans said: \\"We have oak and chestnut barrels. Chestnut is neutral and imparts no taste to the lambic. Oak gives a vanilla-like flavour usually described as 'oaky' and, of course, this is the most common type of wood used by lambic makers.\\"Celebrator Beer News Magazine. Brouwerij Timmermans ‚Äî The World‚Äôs Oldest Lambic Brewery. Retrieved 21 April 2020. New barrels are rarely used by lambic brewers - instead used barrels are procured from the wine regions of Spain, Portugal, Greece, and especially France. The wooden barrels come in three different sizes: Brussels tuns (approx. 250 litres), pipes (approx. 600 litres) and foeders (foudres in French) with a capacity of up to 10,000 litres and even larger. Most pipes are used port wine barrels that came into wide use in lambic production after World War I when port became a popular drink in Belgium. Every brewery has also bought barrels from colleagues who have stopped production, as evidenced by their markings. Some American craft breweries have started producing their own versions of the traditional Belgian barrel-aged gueuze. In 2016 Jester King Brewery released a blended, spontaneously fermented beer which it labelled as \\"M√©thode Gueuze.\\" However, the High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers (HORAL) objected to the name, and the two parties arranged a meeting in Belgium.

Bourbon barrels are by far the most common oak barrels used by brewers in the United States. Each distillery uses its own blend of oak and its own level of charring, leading to distinct differences in the sorts of flavours that brewers can derive from the used barrels. By US law, \\"straight bourbon\\" must be aged in new American white oak barrels. This means that a barrel can only be used once to age true bourbon whiskey, a fact that turns a used barrel into a surplus item for a bourbon distillery. Goose Island's Bourbon County series Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout was one of the first bourbon barrel-aged beers. It was first produced by Greg Hall in Chicago in 1992, when Jim Beam gave the brewer a couple of used barrels.

Description and history Lancaster's Middle Cemetery is located south of the town's current village center, on the east side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 70), south of the Nashua River. It occupies a roughly rectangular lot about in size, fronted by a low stone retaining wall and fringed by woodlands, fields, and a railroad right-of-way to its east. Two entrances in the wall provide access, marked by granite posts, and vehicular circulation within the cemetery is provided by unpaved tracks. Burials in the cemetery include descendants of many of the town's early settlers (who are themselves mostly interred in the nearby Old Settlers' Burying Ground), and the site of Lancaster's first and second meeting houses is marked near its northeast corner. Lancaster was founded in 1643, and originally included land now part of several surrounding towns. Its first meeting house was built on this parcel in 1657; it was burned (along with all the other buildings in the town) in a 1675 Native American attack in King Philip's War. The second meeting house, built on the same site, was also burned by Natives, in 1704. The town center was then moved north to its present location. This site remained otherwise vacant until 1798, when the town acquired one acre for use as a cemetery, its first two cemeteries nearing capacity. Another half acre was acquired in 1842.

The film, produced by R. Dharmaraj, had musical score by C. D. Shaju and was released on 10 September 2010. Plot The film begins with Kesavan (Udhai), after serving a prison sentence, being on a train back home to Palani and he reminisces about his past. Aadhi (Prabha), Kesavan, Perumal (Sarvamathi) and Seenu (Padmakumar) were best friends living in Palani. Aadhi lived with his widow mother and worked in a small workshop while Kesavan lived with his wealthy family and he was jobless. One day, Kesavan scolded Aparanji (Unni Maya) at the hospital for not doing her job well but later, he felt guilty for insulting her and wanted to apologize. Thereafter, he came to know that Aparanji was a medical student who was on an educational trip in Palani and they eventually befriended. Aadhi, Perumal and Seenu urged Kesavan to express his love. Kesavan then accommodated Aparanji and her college mates in his house. Kesavan was still afraid of expressing his love but Aparanji finally came to know about it and she gave him a love letter before going to her native town Tiruppur. The four friends arrived in Pollachi to attend their friend's wedding and Kesavan met Aparanji before the function. At a jewellery shop, Kesavan bought bangles for his lover with his friend Aadhi and a police inspector (Mahanadi Shankar) suspected him of stealing his wife's bangles. The situation degenerated as Aadhi beat the police inspector up and Aparanji's father Subramani (Kadhal Dhandapani) had witnessed the fight. At the wedding function, Kesavan gifted Aparanji the bangles. Subramani who has seen it insulted him and challenged Kesavan to come to his hometown Tiruppur. In Tiruppur, Aadhi challenged Subramani in his house that his friend Kesavan will marry Aparanji but their first attempt failed as Thirthagiri (Tiruppur Selvaraj) intervened. Later, Subramani explained to the four friends that the gangster Thirthagiri wanted him to give his daughter to his brother but Subramani refused. Subramani wanted Kesavan to save Aparanji from Thirthagiri by marrying her. Thereafter, the four friends and Aparanji were arrested by the vengeful police inspector and he took them to Thirthagiri's factory. The five managed to escape from Thirthagiri's henchmen. After getting separated, the friends who had defeated Thirthagiri's henchmen got together and they had a brutal fight with Thirthagiri. When Thirthagiri tried to kill Kesavan with a machete, Aadhi sacrificed his life and died. A vengeful Kesavan then killed Thirthagiri. Back to the present, Kesavan arrives in Palani and he meets his lover Aparanji and his two friends.

Reception A critic said, \\"There is a sense of d√©j√†-vu throughout the film reminding you of many similar ones [..] What the director has managed to convey is the friendship factor, especially the deep bonding between Adhi and Keshavan.

Established by 1674, it is the town's oldest formal cemetery, its burials including family members of many early settlers. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Description and history Lancaster's Old Settlers' Burying Ground is located south of the town's current village center, on the east side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 70), south of the Nashua River. It occupies about , located at some distance from the roadway, between local railroad tracks and the Nashua River on an elongated rise largely surrounded by wetlands. Its accessible either via the eastern end of the town's Middle Cemetery, or via an unpaved cart track roughly paralleling the river north of that cemetery. The cemetery's layout is informal, with remnants of a fence marking its perimeter. Its oldest markers exhibit crude carving, and the oldest identifiable burial is the grave of Dorothy Prescott, who died in 1674. Lancaster was founded in 1643, and originally included land now part of several surrounding towns. Its first meeting house was built on what is now the Middle Cemetery, and land nearby was apparently set aside at an early date for a burying ground. Most early burials in the community are believed to have been informal, on family properties, and often without any formal markers. The town was devastated by a major attack in 1675, during King Philip's War. It is not known where the roughly 50 victims of the attack are buried; the town was abandoned for five years after the attack, and burials may have been either here or near where the victims were slain. The cemetery remained in use until the late 18th century, when Middle Cemetery was opened. In 1937, the locally prominent Thayer family gave additional land to this cemetery at its eastern end, and it is there where a number of its deceased are interred. The last burial in this section was in 2006. The cemetery has since suffered from neglect.

The book also includes story ideas for each world. Reception In the May 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue 145), Jim Bambra said \\"Each colony seems real; the colonists face believable dangers and economic and political problems in their day-to-day struggles to maintain human life on the worlds of the frontier.\\" He did note the absence of planetary and system maps, saying, \\"All you get are star maps of the three arms, which are useful but are only part of the story. As most adventures take place on the worlds of each system, maps showing the physical layout of each planet would have made a welcome addition and greatly enhanced an already impressive product.\\" Bambra concluded that this book was \\"a very worthwhile purchase to anyone interested in the 2300 AD game. It shows the great potential for adventures set in this period of Earth's future history, and it clearly shows the extent of each nation's colonial presence.

As of 2019 it was in service in the Republic of Korea Navy. After commissioning in the 1990s, they significantly increased the Korean Navy's ocean operation ability, especially in foreign domains. They participated in events using their wide deck and contributed to the development of civil- military relations. History After the Korean War, the Korean Navy purchased and operated small refueling ships from the 1960s to the 1980s. These ships were obsolete due to prolonged operation, which forced their retirement beginning in the late 1970s. As the demand for maritime operations increased day, the Navy required vessels to complete the missions. From the mid-1980s, based on ship drying experiences, the Korean Navy proposed building combat support ships domestically. From 1988 to 1990, the first combat support ship, later named Cheonji, was built and launched. Daecheong and Hwacheon were built seven years later. At the time, the Korean Navy decided whether or not to build follow-up ships after finishing the operation test of the first ship. As the needs of support ships increased, the Navy designed the Soyang-class ships in 2016, based on the Cheonji class. Design Cheonji-class ships are about long, wide. It was the largest of the Korean Navy before the construction of . They can load about 4,800 tons of cargo, excluding the ship's supply. They are armed with one gun, one gun, and Device Automatic Gurre Anti-missile Infrared Electromagnetic device, providing self-defence against enemy ships. Resupply systems are located both left and right, to supply two ships at once. At the stern, it is possible to resupply both Cheonji class and other ships by using UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The most distinctive feature is that it is highly adaptable and can transport supplies to ports without cargo handling facilities.

The car can be built from its predecessor, and is set to be eligible in a series of Championships worldwide, such as the European Le Mans Series, and the IMSA Prototype Challenge. While the car was launched on the weekend of the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans, it was not physically seen until September 2019, with the car at Le Mans being a repainted M30.

Following the unveiling of the car in June 2019, the car underwent its shakedown at Le P√¥le M√©canique Al√®s- C√©vennes, with Romain Dumas, at the wheel, before testing moved to the Circuit Paul Ricard, with Nico Jamin at the wheel. David Droux was also involved in the tests. The tests were delayed, due to Duqueine being the last constructor to receive the new, upsized Nissan V8. The car had its public track debut during the post-season testing for the 2019 European Le Mans Series, at the Algarve International Circuit, in Portim√£o, alongside the Ligier JS P320. Key differences between the Norma M30 and the Duqueine D-08 include a re-designed front-splitter, modified side pods, a new engine cover and rear wing. Compared to the other 2020 LMP3 cars, the D-08 is 10kg heavier for the 2020 season, due to a weight penalty being imposed on the car as a result of a late submission of homologation paperwork.

In 1998-1999 the school was designated as a National Blue Ribbon School, and it won other academic achievement awards. In 2011 The Dallas Morning News wrote that Stonewall Jackson had \\"long been a selling point for families interested in moving to Dallas.\\" In 2015 Tawnell D. Hobbs and Holly K. Hacker, of the same publication, described the school as \\"one of the desired campuses.\\" History Stonewall Jackson Elementary School opened on September 13, 1939. According to then DISD superintendent Norman R. Crozier, it was named after Jackson so the school's name would match that of Robert E. Lee Elementary School (now Geneva Heights Elementary School), and because the people establishing the school supported Lee's values. The DISD school board purchased the site from W. W. Caruth for $11,250. On the site, a building designed by C. H. Griesenbeck was built. \\\\- The streets named, Mockingbird and Anita, make clear which school this is referring to. It included a 400-seat auditorium, eleven classrooms, and a dining facility. The building, made as a one story structure, was set up so the district could add another at a later point, and the contracts to built it were valued at a sum of $104,150. A Public Works Administration (PWA) grant of $62,100 partially funded the school. The district planned to start construction prior to January 1, 1939, with construction to finish before the fall of that year. It was originally reserved for white students. DISD desegregated by 1970. Olivia Henderson began serving as principal circa 1991. In 2005 DISD designated Henderson as its \\"principal of the year\\". Matthew Haag of The Dallas Morning News wrote \\"Under Henderson's leadership, Jackson received numerous honors.\\" In previous periods it had about 100 districtwide deaf students and 100 zoned families, but by 2007 the school's popularity among neighborhood parents increased. In 2011 enrollment was approximately 520, and that figure increased to 602 in 2014. The school in 2015 had fifteen portable classrooms, as its utilization was 155%. Due to the situation, in 2012 some parents opposed a rezoning proposal to expand an area apartment complex as they feared it would make overcrowding even worse and make the district change attendance boundaries. 2015 DISD approved a bridge plan that earmarked $5.3 million for expansion of Stonewall Jackson. Henderson retired in 2013. The school was renamed effective July 1, 2018, as the former namesake was a general in the Confederate States of America during the U.S. Civil War. \\\\- The quotation refers to the rally and the associated deadly car attack. The impetus for the renaming was the Charlottesville car attack that occurred the previous year in the backdrop of the Unite the Right rally. All nine DISD board members agreed to the renaming. The school community was to choose a new name, and it was required to be substantially different from the previous one. There were fifty proposals submitted, including one with Henderson's name; in December 2017 the community selected the current name, based on the school's Mockingbird Street location. By June 2018 the new signage was installed. Deaf education It became one of the schools with a component of the Dallas Regional School for the Deaf in 1968. The institution, also known as the Dallas County-Wide Day School for the Deaf, had three other campuses in 1976. The school's deaf curriculum shifted to the total communication approach from the oral communication approach around 1972, and as a result the institution modified its approach to hearing aids. In 1976 the school served elementary and middle school levels and had a total of about 140 deaf students.Kos and Scott, p. 312. In 1999 the majority of deaf DISD students attended Stonewall Jackson. By 1999, 17% of the students were classified as special education, and they were placed in classrooms with regular students as an effort to mainstream their education. In previous periods the number of deaf students, about 100, made up half of the school's enrollment. The numbers of deaf students declined as other DISD schools opened their own programs for the deaf. In 2011 the school had about 40 deaf students, the largest number enrolled at the time in a single DISD elementary school. In 2018 the school had 30 deaf students. The school, as of 2005, gave American Sign Language (ASL) instruction to all students. In addition most employees, including the principal and all teachers, also had knowledge of ASL. \\\\- This book refers to the school by its former name. To foster inclusiveness the school intentionally exposed all of its students to deaf culture. In 2018 former teachers reported that due to the increasing importance of meeting Texas state accountability goals, the school no longer gave all of its students ASL instruction. Academic performance The Dallas Morning News in 2011 wrote that \\"Families have long been attracted to Stonewall Jackson Elementary School for its high state ratings and a reputation on par with private schools in the area.\\" Haag stated in 2013 that \\"Parents have lauded Stonewall, [...] as a campus on par with a private school.\\" Redbook ranked Jackson as an entry in \\"America's Best Schools\\" in 1993. Principles and Methods of Adapted Physical Education and Recreation (2005 edition) states that the \\"unique and exceptional efforts in educating all children\\" enrolled resulted in the school receiving the Blue Ribbon Award, for the 1998-1999 school year. Henderson stated that parental involvement was a significant factor in its academic performance. Due to the school's reputation, area parents are perennially opposed to changing the attendance boundary of the school; circa 2004 there was a proposal to rezone parts of the Stonewall Jackson zone to Robert E. Lee, an underutilized school which did not have the same reputation that Stonewall Jackson had; area parents campaigned to instead build portable buildings on the campus of Stonewall Jackson to accommodate more students. In 2014 Keri Mitchell of Advocate Lakewood/East Dallas stated that various parents in the R. E. Lee zone had their children sent to Stonewall Jackson, but by that year the latter school had reached capacity. From 2008 until 2010 the Texas Education Agency (TEA) ranked the school as \\"exemplary\\" in its school accountability ratings. In 2011 the TEA began counting the performances of the at-the-time 40 deaf students, who were not previously counted, causing that year's ranking to be \\"acceptable\\"; this prompted fears of prospective parents choosing not to enroll their children and a decline in property values. Demographics While 87% of the students in DISD in 2010 were considered to be of low socioeconomic status, that year 30% of Stonewall Jackson students were of low socioeconomic status. In 2011 The Dallas Morning News stated that the campus \\"has become a destination for more affluent families who have a choice about where they send their children.\\" In 2014 the school had 602 students with 23% being classified as low income; 58% of them were non-Hispanic white. Culture When the school had its former name, it was referred to in shorthand as \\"Stonewall\\". In 1996, the second grade class of Evelyn Painter began a garden, and her husband Mark Painter volunteered to help have it planted. Other teachers began to involve their classes in it. By 2002 the garden had of area and included a beehive, a wildflower area, and an area for growing vegetables. Mark Painter became employed by Stonewall Jackson after initially volunteering at the site.

No person other than the attacker was killed in the attack, though six others were injured. The single attacker was affiliated with the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah. Bombing The attack on the Medan Police's headquarters occurred on 13 November 2019, at around 8:40 AM, shortly after the conclusion of a routine morning roll call by the police officers. The explosion occurred within the grounds of the headquarters but outside the building itself. According to reports, the attacker had blended in with a group queueing to obtain certificates of good conduct before detonating the bomb in the parking lot. Other eyewitness accounts reported the attacker wearing a jacket and backpack, and that he had attempted to rush through police examination at the building's entrance. The attacker was initially believed to be a lone wolf, and the explosion injured four police officers and two civilians aside from killing the attacker. In the aftermath of the explosion, police recovered the attacker's body parts, nails, and parts of the explosive device. Perpetrator Though his body was blown up, the perpetrator was identified from fingerprints as a 24-year old resident of the city, Rabbial Muslim Nasution, who had recently been an online motorcycle driver. Initial investigations explored Nasution's connections with the Islamic State-affiliated Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), and several of his family members were questioned by police. His body was buried in the city, despite objections. According to his parents-in-law, Nasution had shown a significant change in behavior in the six months leading up to the suicide attack, which police officials linked to indoctrination by a cleric, who was being sought after by Polri. Police later reported that Nasution's wife had planned another terror attack in Bali, and she was arrested. Following further investigations, the Indonesian Police (Polri) stated that the JAD was behind the attack. Reactions Following the attack, Polri launched several raids in parts of the country, and a week after the attack reported that 74 terror suspects had been apprehended - more than half of which were arrested outside North Sumatra. The Densus 88 shot dead two alleged bomb assemblers following an ambush in Deli Serdang Regency. Some of the suspects were known to have been attending training camps in Karo Regency, and weapons including improvised firearms, airsoft guns, traditional blades, and bows were confiscated. President of Indonesia Joko Widodo ordered for the perpetrators of the attack to be investigated and apprehended. Deputy Speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly Zulkifli Hasan commented that Polri had been caught off guard by the attack, as with the attack on security minister Wiranto.

By 2019, the clan is considered one of the most powerful groups of the Camorra.  History  The clan was founded in the 1960s by the Mazzarella brothers, Ciro known as 'o Scellone, Gennaro and Vincenzo, as a ramification of the Zaza clan, then headed by the historical boss Michele Zaza, who was a relative of the Mazzarella brothers. The organization started dedicating to the cigarette smuggling, establishing itself from the Borgo Santa Lucia to Posillipo, and from Bagnoli to Pozzuoli. The Mazzarella clan grew rapidly and became independent from the Zazas, thanks to Ciro Mazzarella, who since the 1960s demonstrated his entrepreneurial abilities, buying small ships and starting his own smuggling empire. In the 1970s, the organization was already dubbed by the media as the kings of the cigarette smuggling, however, during the eighties and nineties the organization ended up involved in many Camorra wars, in particular against the Contini clan, which led to the death of dozens of affiliates including the father of the Mazzarella brothers, Francesco, killed in an ambush in 1998, with an increase in February of the same year which led to ten deaths in nine days. In the late 1980s the Mazzarellas formed a strong alliance with the Misso and Sarno clans, called Misso-Mazzarella- Sarno, to oppose to the rising power of the Secondigliano Alliance, headed by the Licciardi, Mallardo and Contini bosses. However, in 2008, this alliance was broken after the fall of the Sarno clan, bringing the eastern suburbs of Naples to a new and bloody war. In 1996 Marianna, daughter of Luigi Giuliano, boss of the Giuliano clan, married Michele Mazzarella, son of Vincenzo Mazzarella, the union served to strengthen the relations between the two most important clans of Camorra in the 1990s. The clan has a long history of rivalry with the Rinaldi clan, which caused dozens of deaths from the bloody wars between the two groups. According to revelations made by pentitos of the clan, despite the degree of kinship among the founders of the organization, the Mazzarellas are not united as it seems, actually, each brother has an area of their own influence inside the several territories dominated by the clan. The clan is virtually fragmented into three independent groups.  Ciro Mazzarella  Born in Naples on April 2, 1940, Ciro Mazzarella aka 'o Scellone, was considered the true heir of Michele Zaza, having strong relations with the Sicilian Mafia, in particular with the Catania's mafia family. According to justice collaborators, the late boss of the Catanian mafia, Giuseppe Calderone was the godparent in the baptism of one of the Mazzarella's sons. 'O Scellone had also good relationships with other powerful bosses of the Camorra, such as Mario Fabbrocino and Alfredo Maisto. He was also seen in the company of Vincenzo Casillo of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, in fact, Mazzarella never took a side in the war between the Nuova Famiglia and the NCO, despite the top position Michele Zaza held inside the NF. In the early 1990s Mazzarella had amassed a great wealth, in 1992 he decided to move to Switzerland, after losing a war between Camorra clans in Naples. From his logistics base in Lugano, he created an enviable economic empire with cigarette smuggling that arrived from Montenegro. According to the parliamentary inquiry commission of 1996, Ciro Mazzarella headed a true illegal empire: 200 billion lire in turnover, for a net profit of over 6 billion lire monthly (‚Ç¨4,4 million monthly, in today's exchange). In 2002 he was arrested in Spain, and after his release from prison in 2006, he returned to live in Naples. On September 2, 2018, Ciro Mazzarella, died in his villa in the affluent neighbourhood of Posillipo, Naples at the age of 78.  Historical leaderships  *Ciro Mazzarella known as 'o Scellone (Naples, April 2, 1940 - Naples, September 2, 2018) * Gennaro Mazzarella known as 'o Schizzo (Naples, September 25, 1949) * Vincenzo Mazzarella known as ‚Äòo Pazzo (Naples, May 8, 1956 - Milan, November 5, 2018) * Ciro Mazzarella (Naples, May 3, 1971)  Activities  Since the 20th century, the clan is known to be also active in France. In 2004 Vincenzo Mazzarella, one of the founders of the organization, was arrested in Paris. Mazzarella was reportedly dealing diamonds with African criminals in the country. In 2009, Ciro Mazzarella, born in 1971, was arrested in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. In the country, he lived in a luxurious residence and held the reins of the clan especially for the management of drug trafficking. According to the Spanish police, in Spain the clan is active in Marbella, Fuengirola, Zaragoza and Ceuta. Operating from Barcelona, Salvatore Zazo, one of the top members of the clan, was allegedly involved in a large scheme of international cocaine trafficking from Peru to Europe, with the intention to acquire total control of the Port of Callao; one of his contacts was the drug lord Gerald Oropeza, one of the biggest traffickers in Peru. According to the DEA, Zazo would manage more than U$500 million per year in shipments of cocaine through the ports of the country to Europe. According to the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, the clan has alliances with Albanian mafia groups. In recent years, the new leaders of the Russo clan, from Nola, also formed an alliance with the Mazzarellas.  Present day  According to the reports of the DIA about the Camorra in 2019, the Mazzarella clan, despite the death of two of its founders, still one of most powerful organizations in Campania, dominating the territory in various neighbourhoods, and having numerous groups under their influence. The current leader of the organization is Ciro Mazzarella, born in 1971, who controls the powerful organization from his stronghold in the Mercato area, in Naples.

It is owned by Boyd Gaming. History The riverboat casino's history begins in 1994 as Bally's New Orleans Casino and owned by Caesars Entertainment. The name was later changed to the Belle of Orleans. In 2004, Bally's Belle of New Orleans managed to have the property re-assessed by the Louisiana Tax Commission for $6.5 million, citing the market prices of former casino boats, even though Bally's was still in operation at the time. Previously in 2002, Erroll Williams, the 3rd district assessor, assessed the riverboat at $21.6 million, noting a $33 million construction cost and a 12-year depreciation schedule. It had also previously been granted an exemption on a 3% tax increased imposed on other riverboat casinos in 2001. Also in 2004, a federal probe began into Bally's reduction of its tax liability by 70%, which saved the casino $1 million over 3 years. In late 2004, Columbia Sussex, looking to become a key player in casino operations, first expressed interest in purchasing the Bally's New Orleans property. The sale of Bally's New Orelans to Columbia Sussex was announced in late 2004 and was projected to close in 2005. Simultaneously, Caesars Entertainment was in the process of being acquired by Harrah's. One of the reasons for the sale of the casino was avoiding competition with Harrah's New Orleans once Harrah's had acquired Caesars Entertainment, and, at the time, the Bally's property was its smallest casino. In 2006, the Orleans Levee Board was allowed to seize the boat by a federal judge after Columbia Sussex failed to pay $1.3 million in lease payments. The court order gave Columbia Sussex 10 days to settle the delinquent debt. Later in 2006, voters had the chance to decide whether or not to allow the boat's relocation to St. Mary Parish. The boat had been moved from its Lake Pontchartrain location to Mobile, Alabama for repairs after it broke loose from its moorings and slammed into a pier during Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, after the ship was repaired in Mobile, Alabama following extensive storm damage from Hurricane Katrina, the riverboat was towed to Bayou Boeuf to its new home in Amelia, Louisiana. Since Bayou Boeuf is part of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, it is deemed one of nine channels in Louisiana where riverboat casinos are permitted. It became the second casino in St. Mary Parish, joining the Cypress Bayou Casino in Charenton, which became the first Native casino in the state when it opened in 1993. It opened for business on May 17, 2007. In 2009, Peninsula Gaming, which also owned Evangeline Downs, bought the Amelia Belle for $106.5 million from Columbia Sussex. Prior to that, there were plans to swap the riverboats of Belle of Baton Rouge and Amelia Belle, but those plans were scrapped when Tropicana Entertainment, owner of the Belle of Baton Rouge, filed for bankruptcy. In 2012, Boyd Gaming acquired Peninsula Gaming for $200 million, plus $1.2 billion in debt. In 2015, the site of the former Bally's on Lake Pontchartrain near the Lakefront Airport at the South Shore Marina was planned to be re-developed into an outdoor water park and music venue. Property information The casino consists of over 800 slot machines and 11 table games in its 30,000 square feet of gaming space. Amelia Belle uses Boyd's \\"B Connected\\" players card, linked to many other properties. There are two restaurants, The Cajun Buffet and the Bayou Cafe. The casino is open Monday through Thursday 9am-4am, and then 24 hours a day on the weekend.

He is best known for his satirical comic strip Qirix.  Early life  Doƒüan G√ºzel is from Diyarbakƒ±r, a city in southeastern Turkey that is the unofficial capital of the region of Turkish Kurdistan.  Career  Doƒüan G√ºzel initially drew his comic strip Qirix for the newspaper √ñzg√ºr G√ºndem from 1992 to 1995. \\"Qirix\\" is a pejorative name for a Kurdish masculine character type and the strip follows one example named Keko. On July 31, 1998, G√ºzel was arrested and imprisoned in Istanbul's Bayrampasa Prison for four 1993 cartoons he drew for the pro- Kurdish publications √ñzg√ºr G√ºndem and √ñzg√ºr √úlke. Each cartoon included the phrase \\"Khape TC\\", which is usually translated as \\"the lax or weak Republic of Turkey,\\" though the slang word \\"khape\\" also means \\"prostitute\\" or \\" bastard.\\" He was sentenced to forty months ‚Äì ten months for each cartoon ‚Äì in prison for \\"insulting the State\\" under Article 159 of the Turkish Penal Code, which criminalizes a wide-range of expression. (It was replaced in 2005 with Article 301.) He spent a year in prison before he was pardoned and released on September 16, 1999 by Turkish President S√ºleyman Demirel.

Adolf Lohmann adapted a 1659 hymn by the Jesuit astronomer Albert Curtz, who paraphrased Psalm 19. The melody appeared in Augsburg in 1669. It was No. 1 in the 1938 hymnal Kirchenlied and is part of the German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 381.  History  Adolf Lohmann wrote the song \\"\\" as a revision of a hymn by the Jesuit astronomer Albert Curtz,Curtz, Albert (in German) Neue Deutsche Biographie published in 1659 as a paraphrase of Psalm 19 (The heavens declare the glory of God). The melody was taken from an Augsburg hymnal from 1669. The song expresses the praise of the created world for the Creation. The song was included as No. 1 in the 1938 hymnal Kirchenlied by Georg Thurmair and Lohmann, leading the first section of praise, titled \\"Gro√üer Gott, wir loben dich\\". In the first common Catholic hymnal, the 1975 Gotteslob, the song appeared as GL 263.Alle Ges√§nge des neuen Gotteslob (2013) mit Angabe, ob und ggf. wo sie bereits im Gotteslob 1975 inkl. Di√∂zesananhang enthalten waren (in German) verbaende.erzbistum-koeln.de 2013 In the 2013 edition of Gotteslob, it is GL 381 in the section Lob, Dank und Anbetung (Praise, thanks and adoration).  Text and theme  The song is in five stanzas of six lines each, rhyming AABCCB. The first stanza reflects that the blue sky, white day and black night praise their creator. The second stanza states that all people around the Earth, from the sunrise to sunset, hear the news of the Creator's power. In the third stanza, the singers acknowledge that God's law is brighter than the sun and enlightens their lives. The last two stanzas are written in the first person, praying for protection from the temptations of the proud world (\\"stolze Welt\\"). The last thought is confidence in redemption in all kinds of distress (\\"du wirst mich ja in aller Not / durch deine Kraft erl√∂sen\\").  Melody and musical settings  The melody is in a triple meter, alternating regularly half notes and quarter notes. It begins with an upward fanfare, but the second half remains quieter. The song was set to music in choral versions, such as a three-part setting by Thomas Kiefer, published by Carus-Verlag in 2013. Hubert Schwarz used the name as the title of a collection of 16 organ pieces on hymns from the Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch and the Gotteslob, published by in 1894.

Located west of the town center, the station opened in 1896 by the Chemins de fer Orientaux, (now part of OSE). Today TrainOSE operates just 4 daily Regional trainshttps://tickets.trainose.gr/dromologia/ to Alexandroupoli and Ormenio. The station is unstaffed https://www.evros-news.gr/2017/05/12/œÄœçŒ∏ŒπŒø- œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÑŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ-Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉœÑœÅŒ≠œÜŒµœÑŒ±Œπ-Œø-œÄœÅ/ however there are waiting rooms available, if open. Feres is the first stop after Alexandroupolis, as the railway heads north. History The station was opened in 1874, two years after the line from Alexandroupoli (then Dedeagac) to Istanbul via Edirne was completed. Built by the Chemins de fer Orientaux (CO), from Istanbul to Vienna. The railway reached Ftelia in 1873, when the line from Istanbul to Edirne and Bulgaria was opened. When the railway was built it was all within the Ottoman Empire. Feres (Ottoman: Feretzik) was one of the stations on this line. Until 1909 there was no connection between the lines Istanbul‚ÄìAlexandroupoli and Thessaloniki‚ÄìAlexandroupoli (opened in 1896) at Alexandroupoli; a connection existed between Feres and Potamos (near current Avas). During World War I the railway was an important link as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria and Austria- Hungary were all Central Allies. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about Moden measurement done on www.Openstreetmap.com indicate 10.2 km in Turkey serving Edirne Karaaga√ß station and for between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in BulgariaLe Journal des chemins de fer, des mines et des TP, Paris, 29 March 1930 (in French) come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929. Under the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaaƒüa√ß railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad. This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory, so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed though Ormenio. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE Law 674/1971, Government Gazette A-192/1970 taking over responsibilities for most for Greece‚Äôs rail infrastructure. In the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli‚ÄìSvilengrad linehttps://www.radioevros.gr/epeidi-ta-traina-einai-gemata-anthrwpous-kai- istories-kai-oxi-mono-eisitiria-kai-arithmous/ Which reduced travel times across the whole line. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. Services from Feres to Alexandroupoli were cut back to three trains a day, reducing the reliability of services, and passenger numbers. With passenger footfall in sharp decline. On 11 February 2011, all cross border routes were closed and international services (to Istanbul, Sofia, etc.) were ended. Thus, only two routes now connect Feres with Thessaloniki and Athens (and those with a connection to Alex / Polis), while route time increased as the network was \\"upgraded\\". https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=el&u;=https://m.naftemporiki.gr/story/807704&prev;=search Services to/from Ormenio were replaced by bus.

It was based on a cultural practice of oath taking in Kipsigis called Mummek or Mummiat or Mumma. Mumma means \\"to do something impossibly disgusting . It involves two parties taking an oath and invoking a preemptive curse if the oath is to be broken by any party taking the oath. There usually would also be a performance of black magic involving the skull of a human and a pipe connected to the bellows used by a blacksmith. In 1905, after the murder of Koitalel arap Samoei, the Kipsigis, like the Nandi, were devastated but Christianity had drove its roots into the community (the church had been preaching against African traditions and had been proclaiming that the Talai clansmen were evil and shared a trade with Satan.) and thus the Kipsigis on consensus, decided to make peace with the British. Moments leading to this event includes a move by the British to take the three Orgoik brothers (arap Buigut, arap Boisyo and arap Koilege) on a vacation to Mombasa where they held a negotiation and were given Maize which they brought back and introduced to the Kipsigis. On the day of the Lumbwa treaty, the three brothers and their sons were given up by the Kipsigis and thus were sent to Kericho Prison. In Kipkelion, Kipsigis leaders and a congregation of many kook elders met with the British and per took a Mummiat which involved an oath and promise by both sides, never to harm any other and then followed by performance of black magic that involved savoring a dog into two halves and both sides burying their half besides the other. The British decided to transfer the Orgoik from Kericho Prison to Russinga Island in preservation of their newly founded peace with Kipsigis.

By mid-November, the interim government planned an \\"air bridge\\" to transport goods and bypass the road blockades and ditches dug by protesters.  Food  Food was rationed in the country, with roadblocks by pro-Morales protesters disrupting supply chains causing people to have to queue for hours at shops. However, these shops were also short on basics. An eyewitness reported that in one market of the capital, 5,000 people were waiting to buy one chicken. He referred to the shortages as \\"food terrorism\\". Independent stall owners were closing because of lack of goods, with shops rapidly increasing the prices of their stock. On roads into the city of Santa Cruz, supply trucks that were unable to access had been left with produce rotting.  Gas  Major fuel shortages affected cities in Bolivia. Reuters reported that \\"roads have grown quiet\\", with people not driving to preserve gasoline. In poorer areas, fuel is so limited that people have resorted to using firewood for cooking. The state-run Senkata gas plant in El Alto, which serves this city and the capital of La Paz, was blockaded by protestors demanding the return of Evo Morales to power. On Tuesday 19 November, the military accessed the plant again with armored vehicles. While the military says the operation was peaceful, the human rights ombudsman for Bolivia says that three people were killed. After the plant was re-taken, people began waiting outside with gas canisters; fuel trucks could again leave the plant, doing so in protected police and military convoys.

Craven was found guilty the state's conflict-of-interest law (Sections 2(b), 6, and 23(d) of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 268A). Upon appeal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed they lower court‚Äôs decision in Craven‚Äôs case against the State Ethics Commission. Craven, a resident of Jamaica Plain, was unseated in the November 1984 elections. Two major reasons he lost the election was the conflict of interest finding discussed below but also a December 1983 House reprimand for violating the legislature's code of ethics. After he lost the election, he had been named to a $55,000 staff job with the House Rules Committee by former speaker Thomas W. McGee. Even though he had only been in the position a few days, it allowed his pension to be increased by $18,000 per annum. House Speaker George Keverian blocked the increase. He is also known for playing a lead role in the Doyle- Flynn Bill, passed in 1978, which prohibited using Medicaid funds being used for abortions, until it was overturned in 1981.

Publication history In 1984, Chaosium published a boxed set, Masks of Nyarlathotep, as the first adventure campaign for the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game. In 1996, Chaosium released The Complete Masks of Nyarlathotep, a revised version for the fifth edition of Call of Cthulhu. The original, written by Larry DiTillio and Lynn Willis, had been 160 pages, with 44 separate player handouts (newspaper clippings, handwritten letters, business cards and a matchbox). The new edition was expanded to 224 pages and had additional material provided by Geof Gillan, Kevin A. Ross, Thomas W. Phinney, Michael MacDonald, Sandy Petersen, and Penelope Love, with artwork by Lee Gibbons, Nick Smith, Tom Sullivan, and Jason Eckhardt. However, the 44 handouts that had been separate pieces in the previous edition were incorporated into the book in this edition. Referees wishing to use them have to photocopy the materials. Contents The book covers a campaign of sequential adventures that span the globe from New York, London, Cairo, and Kenya, to Shanghai, and pits the investigators against a world-wide cult that is attempting to complete a ritual that will call Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos and Outer God, to destroy the world. The Investigators must surmount a series of deadly encounters in order to save the world. This adventure is considered by some to be one of the best roleplaying campaigns of all time. Reception In the March 1997 edition of Arcane (Issue 17), Steve Faragher warned prospective referees to \\"Be prepared for quite a bit of work as you try to get your head around 200 pages of densely packed information. There are 45 clue handouts and the place of each in the overall jigsaw must be fully understood by the referee before granting the information to the players. There are nearly 100 major non-player characters whose motives must be fully understood. And there are about 25 mini-scenarios, each of which interlinks crucially with all the others. In trying to read and understand all of this information, you'll find yourself with the feeling that your head will burst open from the information overload.\\" However, he lauded the campaign for its \\"sublime pacing\\", and complimented it for its non-linear storyline and superior organization. He concluded by giving the book a top score of 10 out of 10, saying, \\"This remains one of roleplaying's finest moments, the standard by which all other campaigns should be judged. Its intricacy and open-endedness ... make it a shining example of the dizzy heights to which roleplaying can and should aspire... If ever there was a campaign - for any roleplaying system - that could be described as a work of art, this is it. It's a piece of sustained imagination that is the equal of many classics of literature and cinema.\\" In the October 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue #240), Rick Swan called this campaign \\"a marvel... a work of staggering power, expertly crafted and unforgettable.\\" He concluded by giving it a top rating of 6 out of 6, saying, \\"Absorbing, disturbing and astonishingly adept, Masks of Nyarlathotep is the definition of a role-playing masterpiece.\\" In the July 1998 edition of Dragon (Issue #249), Ray Winninger complimented the campaign on its clarity of direction, saying, \\"Masks was designed in an era in which published adventures were expected to provide clear and specific instructions for running each encounter. Whereas most modern adventures and campaigns present no more than a general blueprint for the game master to follow, Masks rarely misses an opportunity to expound upon each and every one of the options open to the players at any given moment, providing specific advice on how the Keeper might react to all of them.\\" However, Winninger did warn prospective players that \\"Full enjoyment of the campaign requires an unusually ambitious commitment in both time and intensity from the Keeper and players alike.\\" He also noted the lethality of the campaign, saying, \\"Players are expected to lose a handful of Investigators along the way.\\" But he concluded with a strong recommendation: \\"Buy this book ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt think you can keep a group of players together long enough to finish the campaign, even if you‚Äôre not particularly interested in Call of Cthulhu. Merely as an example of good, crisp campaign design, it‚Äôs more than worth its comparatively meager price tag. Those of you who actually play Masks are likely to have some of your most memorable game sessions in store for you.\\" Awards The Complete Masks of Nyarlathotep won the Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Adventure of 1996.

It is the last standing one-room schoolhouse in Flagler County. It is located at 98 Knox Jones Avenue, Bunnell, Florida 32110. In 1949, several members of the African-American community of Espanola, led by schoolteacher Essie Mae Mack Giddens (1927-2003), traveled to Pomona Park, Florida to gather information for building plans for a one-room schoolhouse. The plans for a new one-room schoolhouse, to be built in Espanola, were compiled and submitted to the Flagler County School Board, which promptly approved them.Giddens, Frank Rev. Personal Interview. July 20, 2019. After the Flagler County School Board approved the one-room schoolhouse building plans, the community raised money selling ice cream and peanuts and pooled their donation money together to purchase a lot of land and build a school in their own community, which became known as the Espanola Schoolhouse. The Pallbearer's Society (a mutual aid network) with assistance of the Espanola community, then constructed the building and completed it in 1950. The Flagler County School District supplied furniture, school books (many previously used by Flagler County's ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù segregated public schools) and installed electricity in the schoolhouse building. The Espanola Schoolhouse made it possible for the area's non-high school age black children to attend school in their own neighborhood. Espanola community volunteers did most of the maintenance and service for the Espanola Schoolhouse during its years of operation as a school, as the deed to the building was never transferred to the Flagler County School District.Lapidario, Millie. Reverend renovates with renewed zeal: One-Room school to house museum, education center. Flagler/Palm Coast News-Tribune. May 28, 2005. Schoolhouse Operations Although the Espanola Schoolhouse was part of the Flagler County School District, it did not have running water or an indoor bathroom. It did have a wood-burning stove that provided heat on cold days, a hand-operated water pump in the backyard to provide water and a single outhouse in the backyard, which provided the only bathroom facilities. The Espanola Schoolhouse accommodated thirty or more African-American students per school year. Education at the school spanned first grade through the eighth grade. In addition to African-American children from Espanola, the nearby communities of Neoga and Bimini sent their African-American children to the Espanola Schoolhouse to be educated. Some of these children walked more than six miles per day to attend this school.Recollections of Early Espanola. Flagler Tribune. June 29, 1967. There was only one full-time schoolteacher, Essie Mae Giddens, during the time, 1950 to 1957, which the Espanola Schoolhouse operated as a Flagler County elementary school. Mrs. Giddens arranged all eight grades of students into separate groups in the one-room building and taught different lessons to each group throughout the day. The community provided several volunteers, and teacher's aides, that assisted with the building operations and teaching lessons at the school. After the 1957 school year, the Flagler County School Board moved the first grade through the eighth grade students in the Espanola area to its black segregated elementary school in Bunnell. From 1958 to 1970, the Espanola Schoolhouse operated as an independent kindergarten for the Espanola area. Teacher, Ida Mae Wiley, taught approximately thirty children during each school year during this time. The Espanola Schoolhouse building was closed as a school after the 1970 school year. From 1971 to 2001, the Espanola Schoolhouse was used as a storage facility and gradually fell into disrepair. Starting in 2001, a community renovation project, led by Rev. Frank Giddens and Queenie Jackson, performed considerable exterior and interior repairs, installed air conditioning and added a bathroom inside the building, which enabled it to be open to the public as a clubhouse (youth center). The Espanola Schoolhouse retains its historic appearance and character and now serves the community as the St. Paul Youth Center, which is used for academic tutoring, a social center and summer camp for the area's disadvantaged youth. Architectural attributes The Espanola Schoolhouse has a rectangular plan and measures 23 feet wide by 42 feet deep (966 square feet). Exterior The exterior walls are constructed with concrete block and are finished with stucco. The roof is a wood framed gable design with asphalt shingles. The soffit is fitted with white aluminum ventilation panels and the fascia is fitted with white aluminum trim around the entire roof. A wood framed small gable roof with asphalt shingles covers the front porch, and is supported by two wood pillars. The entire exterior of the building is painted yellow, and the trim of the small gable roof over the front porch and its two wood pillars are painted green. The front porch is a concrete slab that measures 10 feet wide by 5 feet deep. The front (east) of the building includes two large fixed double pane windows and a single wood paneled door that provides the main entrance into the building. The north side of the building includes two large fixed double pane windows, and two smaller double hung windows. The back (west) of the building includes one small double hung window. The south side of the building includes two large fixed double pane windows, two smaller double hung windows and a single wood paneled door that provides an entrance into the rear of the building.Jaye, Randy. Flagler County, Florida: A Centennial History. Booklocker.com, 2017. NE View of the Espanola Schoolhouse (Photo taken July 23, 2019). Interior The interior of the building has had one room addition in the southwest section, which is the bathroom that includes a wood stud framed wall finished with drywall, a single wood paneled door and a privacy wood stud framed wall finished with drywall which were installed in 2004. All other walls in the interior are original to the building and are finished with stucco and painted in a dual white and yellow pattern. The ceilings are finished with drywall, painted white and include several ceiling fans, lights and an entrance panel to a crawl space beneath the roof. The floor is a concrete slab that has been covered with 12‚Äù x 12‚Äù ceramic tiles. The building includes a wood stud framed wall finished with plaster and a large central opening (with no door) that separates the front of the entrance-way section of the building and the schoolroom area. The schoolroom area is mostly in original condition (with the exception of the additions of the bathroom and privacy wall extension) and is furnished with chairs, tables, books and a large television, which is used to view educational and instructional videos. Interior View of the Espanola Schoolhouse (Photo taken July 29, 2019). History of Espanola, Florida Prior to the 1880s, the area now known as Espanola was located within St. Johns County and was known as Raulerson (which was named after a locally settled family). There were only a few scattered residents, no local railroad access, no waterway transportation and the only practical ground road transportation were wagon trails. Around 1884, the narrow-gauge St. Johns & Halifax Railway was built right through the area, and by 1886, it connected East Palatka to Daytona. In 1893, the town of Espanola was established (a circa 1893 railroad map shows both the Raulerson P.O. and Espanola). After 1893, Raulerson does not appear on any maps as Espanola was now the official name of the town. Espanola became a well-established railroad stop and shipping point as Henry Flagler‚Äôs newly formed modernized standard-gauge Florida East Coast Railway ran right through the town. The railroad created new jobs and increased the demand for the construction of new buildings and infrastructure. This resulted in Espanola‚Äôs population to expand beyond 100 by the late 1890s. During this same time, African-Americans began relocating to the Espanola area where they found employment opportunities mainly in the turpentine, lumber and railroad industries.Clegg, John A. The History of Flagler County: The Fascinating Story of a New County with a Rich Historic Background. Hall Publishing Company, 1976. In the early 1900s, large tracts of land in the Espanola area were purchased and leased to set up turpentine still operations. A large saw mill was built in Espanola that was connected with narrow-gauge railroads that branched into the nearby woods where virgin timber was harvested. These timbers were sawed into lumber, loaded onto Florida East Coast Railway cars, and shipped to distant markets. Now that the railroad was completed through the area and large quantities of timber was clear-cut, the mills began to close and the local economy shrank. In 1915, the Dixie Highway was built from the Midwest to the Southern United States, and a portion of it ran right through Espanola. This highway opened a new tourist trade as well as attracted new residents and businesses, which boosted the economy in the Espanola area. Over-night tourists (known as ‚ÄòTin Can Tourists‚Äô) prompted the establishment of a new hotel and camps to accommodate these automobile- campers. When Flagler County was founded in 1917, from sections of St. Johns and Volusia counties, Espanola became part of Flagler County. Since Espanola was one of the only areas in Flagler County that African-Americans could purchase property many families settled here, built homes and contributed to the community's development.Wyland, Scott. Homeward Bound. Daytona Beach News- Journal. June 27, 2005. In 1920, the population of Espanola had grown to 385, and there were many new businesses in town in addition to the hotel and camps including an automobile garage, the offices of the Neoga Naval Stores Company, a general store, post office with mail route, cafe, rooming house, barbershop, dry goods store, stave mill, grocery store and school. The Florida Land Boom of the 1920s brought many additional travelers through the area, but by 1926, it went bust and fizzled out. Farming picked up as a lucrative business and provided a boost to the local economy as many African-Americans found employment on local farms. Large quantities of potatoes, corn and narcissus bulbs were grown in nearby areas such as Bimini. This produce was loaded onto Florida East Coast Railway cars at the Espanola stop and shipped to various regional marketplaces. In 1926, a new highway (now U.S. 1) was built from St. Augustine directly to Bunnell and bypassed Espanola. This rendered the Dixie Highway route through Espanola obsolete as automobile traffic drastically declined and very few tourists and travelers ventured to Espanola. The economy of Espanola was devastated and over the following two decades many people relocated and all the businesses closed with the exception of a local grocery store. The U.S. Post Office in Espanola closed on February 28, 1955, as there was no longer enough mail business or residents in the area to justify an official government office. Today, the railroad that passed through Espanola is gone and the many commercial buildings that were constructed during Espanola's heyday have all been razed. The area has evolved into a quiet rural community with no noticeable remnants of its once busy and prosperous past. The community now includes residential homes, a church, the one-room Espanola Schoolhouse, a Flagler County Fire Station, cemetery and community center. African-Americans make up a large portion of Espanola's population, and some families have lived in the area for more than four generations. Listing on the National Register of Historic Places The initial nomination was approved by the Florida National Register Review Board on February 6, 2020 and was then sent to the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service for final approval by the Keeper of the National Register. On July 22, 2020, the Espanola Schoolhouse was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Espanola Schoolhouse is Flagler County‚Äôs first landmark directly associated with black history to receive national recognition. The historical significance of the property is associated with the areas of Education and Black Ethnic Heritage. The Espanola Schoolhouse was listed on the NRHP under a multiple property submission: (Florida's Historic Black Public Schools MPS).Jaye, Randy.

Contents In 1996, White Wolf Publishing released Vampire: The Dark Ages, which took their popular horror roleplaying game Vampire: The Masquerade and reset it in medieval Europe in the year 1197. The same year, White Wolf released the first supplement for Vampire: The Dark Ages titled Constantinople by Night, a 128-page softcover book designed by Philippe Boulle, Joshua Mosqueria-Asheim, and Lucien Soulban, with illustrations by Michael Gaydos, Eric Lacombe, Chuck Regan, Andrew Ritchie, and Andrew Trabbold, and cover art by William O'Connor and Matt Milberger. The book provides details of medieval Constantinople, including history, geography, and notable persons. In addition to actual history, the book mixes in the fictional history of the Trinity of the Undead. The focus of the book is on the Kindred, and how players new to the city can interact with the warring factions. The book also includes a brief scenario for an adventure in the city. Reception In the February 1997 edition of Arcane (Issue 16), Mark Barter was enthusiastic about this book, saying, \\"This is a spectacular backdrop for adventure and intrigue - a powerful and beautiful city tainted by blood and pride, which is founded on a dream of eternity that is about to end in flames.\\" Barter thought this was \\"an excellent supplement\\" but criticized the book for the brief scenario, commenting \\"A full-length adventure would have rounded off the package perfectly rather than the slightly threadbare outlines given here.\\" He concluded by giving the book an excellent rating of 9 out of 10, saying, \\" Impressive in its ambition and epic sweep, this is a magnificent addition to the ongoing masterpiece that is the World of Darkness.\\" In the October 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue #240), Rick Swan calls the book \\"a humdinger, a dazzling treatise on ancient Byzantine society as seen through the eyes of a psychopath.\\" Although Swan liked the content, he found that the book \\"makes life difficult for the gamemaster, as it neglects to include either an index or a serviceable table of contents.\\" He also thought that \\"the brief scenario tacked on at the end doesn‚Äôt do justice to the material that precedes it.\\" Despite these problems, Swan gave the book an above average rating of 5 out of 6, saying, \\"Constantinople‚Äôs vivid prose makes the glitches easy to overlook.\\" References Category:Role-playing game books Category:Vampire: The Masquerade ","title":"Constantinople by Night"},{"id":"62393902","text":"The Lonesome Trail is a 1930 American western film directed by Bruce Mitchell, starring Charles Delaney, Ben Corbett, and Jimmy Aubrey.

The vertical stabilizer of XV239 was salvaged and displayed as part of a memorial to the crew at the Toronto Aerospace Museum. On 2 September 1995, a Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod aircraft crashed into Lake Ontario during an air display, killing all seven crew members on board. This was the second loss of an RAF Nimrod in four months, following the ditching of a Nimrod R1 in May. Aircraft The aircraft involved was XV239, a Nimrod MR.2 maritime patrol aircraft from RAF Kinloss. Operated by No. 120 Squadron, the aircraft was originally delivered to the RAF as an MR.1 in 1971, before being one of 35 Nimrod airframes selected for upgrade to MR.2 standard in the mid 1970s. Background On 23 August 1995, the aircraft and its crew had departed RAF Kinloss for Canada, where it was scheduled to take part in two separate air shows. On the 26 and 27 August, the aircraft had been displayed at the Shearwater International Air Show at CFB Shearwater in Nova Scotia. Following this, it transited to Toronto Pearson International Airport from where it would be based for display at the Canadian International Air Show (CIAS). The manoeuvres planned had been used to display the Nimrod for much of the previous twenty years, with the four and a half minute routine described as \\"relatively straightforward\\". The day prior to the CIAS display, the aircraft's captain, Flight Lieutenant Dom Gilbert, gave an interview in which he stated that the plan was to approach the limits of the aircraft's performance. Crash details On 2 September, the aircraft left Pearson Airport on time for its planned display slot. The weather was classed as excellent, with a slight on-shore wind (the display was to take place offshore over Lake Ontario). Having completed safety checks, the aircraft was taken on the standard display sequence for the Nimrod, two circuits of the display line (the area where the viewing crowd was located) and two \\"dumb-bell\\" turns; the dumb-bell manoeuvre encompassed a turn away from the display line and climb to approximately 1,000 ft, followed by a turn in the opposite direction and descent back onto the display line. The circuits and first dumb-bell manouvre were successfully completed, followed by a slow fly-past with the undercarriage lowered. The aircraft then turned to starboard to begin the second dumb-bell turn - the undercarriage raised and the flaps set to allow the aircraft to climb at an attitude of 24¬∞. As it reached the top of the climb, the airspeed fell to 122 knots as a result of the engines being powered back, before the aircraft banked and pointed downwards. Although the airspeed increased slightly, it was well below the recommended 150 knots for that part of the display, while the g-force load went to 1.6g. The low speed and g-loading led to a stall which saw the aircraft's nose drop to 18¬∞ below the horizon and it bank 85¬∞ to port. Despite full starboard aileron and full power being applied, the aircraft was too low by this point to recover and it hit the water. The impact caused the airframe to break up, with the seven crew on- board killed instantly. Recovery The recovery effort was immediately set in motion; divers initially located the wreckage, which had broken into four sections, but were unable to locate the crew. The search was then postponed for a day to allow the air show to continue. On the resumption of the search, a boat from the Toronto Police Service made its way to the crash site and dropped a remotely operated underwater vehicle containing sonar and video cameras. This was able to display images of the wreckage clearly to allow the recovery team to recover both the bodies of the crew and debris from the aircraft. Investigation A significant amount of data was available, given the public nature of the accident, and the RAF inquiry was able to determine that all of the aircraft's systems had been functioning normally, making it possible to rule out any mechanical or structural failure of the Nimrod as a potential cause. This resulted in the inquiry focusing on the actions of the crew, and in particular the aircraft's captain. It was determined that, at a previous display, he had made an error following the second dumb-bell turn that led to his crossing over the display line; this had not been reported as it should have been, which would have allowed analysis of the display manoeuvres before a scheduled practice run. Instead, on deploying to Canada, the captain amended the manoeuvre by tightening his turn to avoid crossing over the crowd through reducing engine power. This removed the safety margins for the aircraft in performing the display manoeuvres (primarily the dumb- bell) as it took it below the recommended speed and led to it stalling. The inquiry identified a number of deficiencies in the training regime for Nimrod display that may have contributed to the accident. Primarily, it suggested that the lack of a structured training programme, with theory and simulation as well as practice flights, combined with a lack of supervision in the air, led the captain to try out techniques outside the recommended performance envelope of both the Nimrod and the display. Aftermath The recommendations of the RAF inquiry as regards the display of the Nimrod saw a change in the selection of display crews - up to this point, several Nimrod captains and crews per display season were selected. Following the inquiry, it was decided that a single crew, made up of instructors, would be specially selected from the Nimrod Operational Conversion Unit, rather than from operational squadrons.

The Justice Democrats helped Ocasio-Cortez run her campaign, New Consensus appointed Gunn-Wright policy director in which capacity she has worked with Desmond Drummer on the Green New Deal. To Gunn-Wright, climate policy has always been connected to social justice. For example, over one million African-American people live half a mile from an oil and gas facility, and six million live in the same county as a refinery. She has established a \\"climate mobilisation office\\", through which she works on climate change policy. Gunn-Wright has called for Advanced Research Projects Agency‚ÄìEnergy (ARPA-E) to be as generously funded as DARPA, and the creation of a green bank that will offer financing to communities that do not have access to clean water or transportation. The Green New Deal includes a plan for 100% renewable energy, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable jobs and high-quality healthcare. She has since been involved with the Ocasio-Cortez town halls and the CNN climate town hall. She has written for The Guardian and was included in Time magazine's list of the top women fighting to end climate change. Gunn-Wright was a signatory on the Women Lead Climate campaign.

Humans reached the current-day New England region by at least 10,500 years ago and likely earlier, occupying a recently de- glaciated environment. Pre-contact Native American groups in New England did not have full-fledged market economies and physical artifacts tended to change very slowly. However, technological shifts brought agriculture and ceramics to the region prior to the arrival of European settlers in the 17th century. Environmental changes and early human presence The Wisconsinian glacial retreat at the end of the Pleistocene began 15,000 years ago in New England. Pollen and sediment studies have indicated a shifting climate pattern in New England in the Pleistocene, with dramatic climatic changes between warm periods and ice ages. A preserved peat layer beneath glacial till in Millbury, Massachusetts, contains oak, sweet gum and pine pollen dated to 38,000 years ago and Boston Harbor sediments of similar age contain extensive shellfish, indicative of warmer temperatures than today. Radiocarbon dating of caribou collagen in Dutchess County, New York is evidence of human arrival in the Northeast by 12,530 years ago, with the oldest confirmed sites in Maine and the Connecticut River valley marking the start of the Early Archaic period. At the start of the Holocene, the post-glacial tundra landscape of New England was covered in lichen, shrubs and moss around the shores of glacial lakes. However, forests returned quickly and pine pollen has been discovered in ponds in southeastern Massachusetts dating to 13,500 years ago. Pine, hemlock and oak colonized the landscape by 11,000 years ago. One of the oldest signs of human presence in the area is the Bull Brook site in Ipswich, Massachusetts dates to 10,500 years ago. Early Archaic period Initially, some researchers thought the period from 9000 to 8000 years ago marked a gap in human presence. Pollen data suggests a spruce-pine boreal forest similar to those that cover much of Quebec and Ontario. Thick, boreal forest vegetation blocks sunlight, limiting undergrowth, small animal populations and overall carrying capacity. Research at Cree sites at Lake Mistassini in Quebec showed that human populations could survive in a boreal environment. In the Early Archaic, human activity may have concentrated in widening river mouths, with coastal breezes moderating temperatures and added sunlight. By 6000 BP, boreal forest disappeared in southern New England and forest fires may have opened tracts of northern New England to hardwood oak forestation. Glacial Lake Sudbury remained for several thousand years in the early Holocene, forming part of an internal waterway Boston Harbor to Narragansett Bay. Early Archaic artifacts include atl-atls, rhyolite biface tools, slug-shaped scrapers and other types of stone tools. Middle Archaic Middle Archaic human presence left more extensive physical remains than the Early Archaic, including a 90 square meter house floor at one site, ulu stone knives, perforators and the first evidence of a red ochre burial of a middle-aged woman, unearthed in 1977. Yellow-brow limonite soil is oxidized red hematite by fire, leaving evidence of hearths. Excavations in Westborough found pits of charred lambsquarter seeds, stored as a winter protein source, along with oak, sycamore, sweet fern, water lily, huckleberry and blackberry seeds. New England has only one native chert deposit, interbedded with limestone in Cumberland, Rhode Island. Middle Archaic people in southern New England relied on Braintree argillite for tools, mining in the Blue Hills. Lithic fragments also include Lynn Volcanics in the Boston Basin, chert quarried in eastern New York and felsite from Maine and New Hampshire. Pecking and grinding tools were mostly made out of granite. Some archaeologists in the late 20th century originally proposed that Middle Archaic people were Paleo-Eskimos who migrated north following caribou herds, but later research debunked this idea. Late Archaic Human populations increased in the Late Archaic and after 4500 BP, use of quartz rapidly increased in southern New England. Quartz flakes, turtle bone scatters, charcoal pits, trash pits and pots mark the population growth. Native Americans in the Late Archaic used wild ginseng, growing along rivers, as a remedy along with jimson weed and amanita mushrooms. Corn and tobacco were introduced from outside the region. High quality quartz crystals increasingly appeared at sites in the Late Archaic, different from the conchoidally fractured crystals common in New England, suggesting a possible ritual use. As the coastlines stabilized at their present locations, larger shellfish beds built in more predictable locations. Archaic-Woodland Transition The 1000 years after the Archaic are debated by archaeologists. From Maine to Georgia, the practice of burying the dead with red ochre powder mixed with animal fat became commonplace. The deceased were cremated and buried with soapstone bowls, broadspears, gouges, axes and occasionally native copper. Burial sites are commonly found in river plains. New species such as goosefoot and amaranth appeared in the region, but were not clearly domesticated. Ragweed pollen increases in sediment cores from Lake Nippeneckit in southeastern Massachusetts, suggesting artificial burning and clearing of forests. Soapstone‚Äîsteatite‚Äîmining became much more common, but the heaviness of tools may have limited groups from moving and prompting more dependence on trade with groups near steatite, argillite and basalt deposits. With steatite mines in southern Worcester County, the Quinebaug and Blackstone River became a major trading route with Narragansett Bay. Dugout canoes are speculated to be the means of transportation. Woodland Period There is evidence of climate cooling 3000 to 1000 years ago in New England and the water table may have risen with increased precipitation. . Oak and hemlock lost out to shrubs and forest-edge trees, suggesting widespread burning of forests. Some settlements may have shifted closer to the coast. Some archaeologists have proposed that the advent of ceramics during the period changed gender roles. . The Middle Woodland marked a shift toward greater food storage, with more extensive storage pits and large roasting and smoking racks at the Wheeler site and Shattuck Farm Site. Jasper entered the region from Pennsylvania and Hopewellian artifacts appeared. At the Bullen and Shattuck Farm sites, graphite is strongly associated with Middle Woodland artifacts. By the Late Woodland, New England's climate was virtually identical to the present, although widespread burning of underbrush created large meadows. Between 1000 and 1200 years ago, frost-resistant corn was imported to the region, driving a shift toward more sedentary lifeways. Archaeological research From the 1960s onward, thermoluminescence dating has offered a secondary way of dating non-organic material, but analysis requires the destruction of samples at high cost and a scarcity of potsherds complicates this form of research. Understanding of New England prehistory is closely related to archaeological research in the region. Archaeologists have debated whether soil microstratigraphy has a role in dating artifacts. Tilling of farmland, roots, animal burrows and the annual freeze-thaw cycle all work to bring some artifacts closer to the surface. By 1990, archaeologists had gathered 300 radiocarbon dates from different sites, with some gaps between 9000 and 8000 years ago and 7000 to 5500 years ago.

The mineral was first found in a veins of dolomite carbonatites veins at the bottom of the Zhelezny (Iron) Mine in the Kovdor massif, Kola Peninsula, Russia. Cattiite was tentatively identified as Mg3(PO4)2 ‚Ä¢ 22H2O, which as a high hydrate magnesium orthophosphate. Later structural studies, revealed the existence of two polytypes named Mg3(PO4)2 ‚Ä¢ 22H2O-1A1 and Mg3(PO4)2 ‚Ä¢ 22H2O-1A2. The polytype, Mg3(PO4)2 ‚Ä¢ 22H2O-1A2, had both the mineral and the name of the mineral approved (2000-032) by the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names or the (CNMMN) of the International Mineralogical Association or the (IMA). The name was approved by the CNMMN and the IMA was Cattiite. The mineral, Cattiite, was named that in the honor of the Michele Catti, Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Milano Bicocca in Italy, because of his work on the crystal chemistry of hydrated oxy-salts. Natural Occurrence and Localities Cattiite bas been found in centimeter sized cavities that are within a 20‚Äì40 cm thick of the dolomite carbonatites that were enriched in late hydrothermal Mg-rich phosphates that was located at the Zhelezny Mine quarry. The vein of dolomite carbonatites that the Cattiite is found cross-cuts forsterite and magnetite ore that are located at the bottom of the mine's quarry. The mineral occurs as a mass that is up to 1.5 cm in size and usually contains a single crystal that fills the free space in the cavities and interstices of associated minerals. These associated minerals are dolomite, nastrophite, bakhchisaraitsevite, sjogrenite, magnetite, and carbonate-fluorapatite. Cattiite is also mined in Western Australia, Chile, France, Namibia, and United Kingdoms. Cattiite Properties Crystallography Cattiite is triclinic and has both very close cell parameters and crystal structures. The mineral has a space group of P. The structures of the mineral are based on an isolated PO4 tetrahedra and Mg(H2O)6 octahedra that are joined by hydrogen bonds. The structures of the (001) sheets of the octahedra plus a sheet made of octahedra and tetrahedra form a polar (001) layer that is copied by a center of symmetry to form a layer with thickness that correlates with the c parameter. The X-ray single-crystal diffractometry of the mineral, Cattiite, has a cell that is a = 6.932(2) √Ö, b = 6.925(3) √Ö, c = 16.154(5) √Ö, Œ± = 82.21(4)¬∞, Œ≤ = 89.70(4)¬∞, Œ≥ = 119.51(3)¬∞, V = 666.3(3) √Ö3, and Z = 1. Physical Properties Cattiite usually occurs as a mass of single crystals that are sometimes shown to be the dominant form on the {001} axis. Along the {001} axis is where the percent cleavage located at, while the uneven fractures are in other directions. Luster of Cattiite is vitreous, with a gypsum-like pearly sheen that is on the perfect cleavage planes {001}. The mineral is colorless and transparent. Cattiite has a Mohs hardness of 2 and also a tenacity of being brittle. The specific gravity of the Cattiite is 1.65. The density of the mineral is 1.65 g/cm3 (Measured) and 1.64 g/cm3 (Calculated). It is non-pleochroic and bi-axial (-). The refractive index of the mineral is Œ± = 1.459 (1), Œ≤ = 1.470(1), and Œ≥ = 1.470(1). The optical orientation of Cattiite is X ^ [001] = 80¬∞, Y ^ [100] = 10¬∞, and Z is perpendicular to [001]. The minerals also has a weak dispersion, r < v. Chemical Properties The high hydration that Cattiite has makes it unstable under heating. There were thermal studies done that showed that Mg3(PO4)2 ‚Ä¢ 22H2O as a synthetic at 70 ¬∞C, was partially dehydrated. This dehydration of the mineral began occurring ar 40-60 ¬∞C depending on the relative humidity in the air. It is easily soluble in diluted cold 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl). Cattiite also loses water under a vacuum when it was studied under an electron microprobe.

It was the first projection device to use an intermittent movement, which became the basis of all cine cameras and projectors. It was formed by a sheet of glass on which different drawings were made, and the sheet was mounted on a Maltese cross mechanism, thanks to which the image would move suddenly. The most common drawing was the 'dancing skeleton' in which six sequential images of a skeleton were animated in the viewing pane.  History  The Choreutoscope was invented by Lionel Smith Beale in 1866. Beale used it for demonstrations at the Royal Politechnic. However, Baele was not the only one to create a Choreutoscope, a few years later William C.Huges created his own Choreutoscope in 1884, and B .Brown created a similar machine to it the year 1896.

He made his professional debut in March 2005, reaching the top makuuchi division in September 2012. He has fought in the top division in four tournaments and his highest rank has been maegashira 11. Originally from ≈åshima stable, he now wrestles for Tomozuna stable. He was demoted from the j≈´ry≈ç division to the makushita division in 2017. Career He began sumo at the age of just three and won national championships for five consecutive years from the second to sixth years of elementary school. He joined professional sumo upon graduation from junior high school, recruited by ≈åshima stable. At just tall he was accepted by passing the secondary exam for promising recruits who do not meet the primary height requirement. In his first few tournaments he fought under his own surname of Matsushima, but soon adopted the shikona of Asahish≈ç. He won the makushita division championship or y≈´sh≈ç in September 2011 with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record and this performance saw him promoted to the elite sekitori ranks for the first time in the November 2011 tournament. He was the first sekitori from the city of Noda. In April 2012 his heya closed upon the retirement of his stablemaster, former ≈çzeki Asahikuni, and he moved to Tomozuna stable. In May 2012 he saw his longtime stablemate Kyokutenh≈ç win the top division championship at 37 years of age, and was overcome with emotion while waiting to congratulate him afterwards. In July 2012 he had his best performance to date, a 10‚Äì5 record at j≈´ry≈ç 4, and this earned him promotion to the top makuuchi division for the first time. He was the tenth wrestler who began at ≈åshima stable to reach the top division. He came through with a winning record in his makuuchi debut, but two make-koshi or losing scores in his next two tournaments saw him demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç. In July 2013 he somewhat fortuitously won promotion back to the top division despite only scoring 9‚Äì6 at j≈´ry≈ç 7, due to a large number of vacancies with five men being demoted from makuuchi, and also many j≈´ry≈ç wrestlers around him under- performing. However, in September he injured his elbow in a match with Shotenro on Day 9 and had to withdraw. Although he returned to the tournament on Day 13 and won two more matches he could not prevent demotion back to j≈´ry≈ç. This has been his final appearance in the top division to date. In 2017 Asahish≈ç narrowly failed to get a majority of wins against losses in three straight tournaments, and his third 7‚Äì8 in May 2017 cost him his place in j≈´ry≈ç, as only he and Takagenji had demotable records and Abi and Iwasaki were both deserving of promotion. During this tournament he was reprimanded on Day 2 by the ringside judge Minato Oyakata, the former Minatofuji, for giving Takagenji an extra shove after the match was already over. Asahish≈ç apologized for the \\"educational slap\\" afterwards, explaining that he was annoyed at Takagenji (then just 20 and in his first j≈´ry≈ç tournament) for disrespecting his opponents by not bowing properly. He was demoted to makushita after 34 tournaments as a sekitori, and has not managed a return to the paid ranks as of November 2019. Salt-throwing routine from July 2014 Asahish≈ç has a habit of throwing unusually large amounts of purifying salt into the ring before his bouts, previously the trademark of Mitoizumi and Kitazakura. He began doing it in May 2012 to change his luck after suffering ten straight defeats from Day 1, and he promptly won his next five matches. He told reporters in July, \\"I want the fans to remember my name.\\" He throws so much salt on the start lines that he occasionally causes his opponents to slip on the surface at the tachi- ai. Asahish≈ç is known for his sense of humour and love of practical jokes, which has made him a regular on the chat show circuit despite his relative lack of success in the top division. In December 2014 he appeared in a commercial with three other wrestlers as part of a heavy metal band, promoting Docomo's Moveband activity tracker. Fighting style Asahish≈ç is an oshi- sumo specialist who prefers pushing and thrusting techniques to grabbing the opponent's mawashi. His most common winning kimarite is oshi-dashi, or push out. He also regularly wins by forcing his opponent to the floor of the dohy≈ç by hiki-otoshi (pull down) or hataki-komi (slap down). Family Asahish≈ç married a woman from Tokyo in June 2014 and their first child, a son, was born in November 2014.

The novel is set between the period 1914 to 1919. The Chairman of the Ukrainian Oil Company suggests that he meet Israel Kensky, a wealthy and influential elderly Jewish Russian man, before departing. In London, Hay becomes embroiled in machinations and intrigues involving the Romanov monarchy. The Grand Duke Yaroslav, the Prince Serganoff, Kensky's daughter Sophia, Boolba, American gangster Cherry Bim, and the Grand-Duchess Irene Yaroslav become entangled in plots, conspiracies, and assassination plans. Serganoff, the Chief of the St. Petersburg Police, attempts to blackmail Irene into marrying him. He does this by arranging a police raid on the Silver Lion where the conspirators meet. The conspirators are known as the Foreign Friends of Freedom. Serganoff abducts Irene but is shot dead by Bim. Irene avoids arrest. Hay travels to Kiev in June, 1914 where he again encounters Kensky, who gives him a book, The Book of All-Power, that can allegedly turn men into puppets willing to do one's will. Hay also happens to meet Grand-Duchess Irene Yaroslav, a beautiful young Russian woman who values Israel Kensky. Irene becomes an unwitting part of a plot by an ambitious and ruthless Russian prince, Serganoff, and recrosses paths with the American gunman named Cherry Bim. Several years later, in 1919, during the Russian Revolution and civil war, Hay again encounters Irene, Kensky, and Bim, in very different circumstances. The Czarist regime has been overthrown by the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Hay is imprisoned as an enemy of the Revolution. Irene's former butler Boolba, who has joined the Bolsheviks, is now a person of some importance in Moscow, while Irene is a servant whom Boolba terrorizes. Entrusted with Kensky's coveted Book of All- Power, they must try to escape Russia before they are executed. Hay, Bim, and Irene are able to escape from Boolba and his men. Bim shoots the blind Boolba dead as they flee to Poland aboard a train. Bim saved the Book of All-Power which he reveals contains English thousand pound notes. References Bibliography * Clark, Neil.

History Nicolai Abildgaard bought a property in Virum and in 1804-05 constructed a new two-storey country house for his own use. He gave it the name Spurveskjul (Sparrow's Hideaway) after the adjacent forest. The house was surrounded by an extensive garden. Abildgaard wrote many of his friends in Italy and France, asking them to bring plants and seeds for his garden back to Denmark. He was one of the first to grow broccoli in Denmark. Abildgaard died at Spurveskjul on 4 June 1809. Architecture The two-storey main building from 1805 stands on an older foundation. It is a narrow, rectangular building constructed with timber framing and white finishing. The thatched roof features a wall dormer on both sides. The triangular gable of the south-facing dormer features a portrait relief of Nicolai Abildgaard. The main entrance is located in the western gable. A one-storey side wing extends from the east gable of the two-storey main wing. It was originally a free- standing building from the 17030s but connected to the main wing in 1846.

Fertilizer factories near to the mine. Thin section of apatite-rich carbonatite in cross polarised transmitted light. Thin section of apatite-rich glimmerite in cross polarised transmitted light. The Siilinj√§rvi carbonatite complex is located in central Finland close to the city of Kuopio. It is named after the nearby village of Siilinj√§rvi, located approximately 5 km west of the southern extension of the complex. Siilinj√§rvi is the second largest carbonatite complex in Finland after the Sokli formation, and one of the oldest carbonatites on Earth at 2610¬±4 Ma.Kouvo, O., 1984. GTK internal report to H. Lukkarinen, 4 p. The carbonatite complex consists of a roughly 16 km long steeply dipping lenticular body surrounded by granite gneiss. The maximum width of the body is 1.5 km and the surface area is 14.7 km2. The complex was discovered in 1950 by the Geological Survey of Finland with help of local mineral collectors. The exploration drilling began in 1958 by Lohjan Kalkkitehdas Oy. Typpi Oy continued drilling between years 1964 and 1967, and Apatiitti Oy drilled from 1967 to 1968. After the drillings, the laboratory and pilot plant work were made. The mine was opened by Kemira Oyj in 1979 as an open pit. The operation was sold to Yara in 2007.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The Siilinj√§rvi apatite mine is the biggest open pit in Finland. Currently the mine comprises two pits; the larger southern S√§rkij√§rvi and the smaller northern Saarinen satellite pit. The S√§rkij√§rvi pit is approximately 250 m deep, with a bench height of 28 m.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The Saarinen pit is located some 5 km north of the main S√§rkij√§rvi pit.Salo 2016 The overall blast rate at the mine is 600 kt per week, 450 kt from the S√§rkij√§rvi pit and 150 kt from the Saarinen pit. Almost all of the glimmerite-carbonatite series rocks are ore-grade rocks; the fenites and crosscutting diabases are waste rocks. There are, however, some late apatite-poor carbonatite veins and certain blocks of carbonatite-glimmerite with < 0.5 wt-% P2O5. The reason why those are barren of apatite is unknown, but it could be related to metamorphism and fluid flow.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The Siilinj√§rvi mine is the only operating phosphorus mine in the European Union. Since 1979, over 400 Mt of rock have been mined, about 65% being ore. By year 2016, the mine had produced 24.7 Mt of the main product, apatite. Ore reserves were 205 Mt in January 2016. The current production is roughly 11 Mt of ore per year, while the average in situ grade is 4.0 wt-% of P2O5.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 Roughly 85% of the apatite concentrate is processed on-site in Siilinj√§rvi to produce phosphoric acid and fertilisers, the rest of the concentrate is used in the company's other factories. The by-products are mica and calcite concentrates.Salo 2016 Apatite concentrate is produced by flotation in the concentrator near the S√§rkij√§rvi pit. The concentrate can be then processed into phosphoric acid using sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid is currently derived from Pyh√§salmi mine pyrite.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015  Surrounding rocks  Saarinen satellite pit. The surrounding bedrock of Siilinj√§rvi intrusion is Archean, although the boundary between the Archean and Paleoproterozoic bedrock is near-by. The nearest Paleoproterozoic rocks belong to the North Savo Black Schist area.Lukkarinen 2008 The glimmerite-carbonatite intrusion in Siilinj√§rvi is located in the south-eastern part of the Iisalmi granite-gneiss terrain.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The terrane records both some of the youngest and oldest Archean events in the Fennoscandian Shield, the 2.6 Ga Siilinj√§rvi intrusion and nearly 3.2 Ga mesosomes found in granulites.M√§ntt√§ri & H√∂ltt√§ 2002 Seismic studies have shown that the crustal thickness inside the Iisalmi terrane is unusually thick, some 55‚Äì60 km.Korsman et al. 1999 The terranes thickness is due to several processes, such as thrust-stacking during the Svecofennian collision and post-collisional underplating. At the present erosion level the western part of the terrane is mostly metamorphosed at greenschist facies during the Svecofennian orogeny.Sorjonen-Ward & Luukkonen 2005 The dominating surrounding rock type in the Siilinj√§rvi area is a granite gneiss with varying texture and to some extent, mineralogy. The main minerals are plagioclase feldspar, quartz, microcline feldspar, biotite and hornblende. The surrounding granite gneiss extends some 100 km to the north from Siilinj√§rvi.Puustinen 1971 The Karelian (2.0-1.9 Ga) sedimentary rocks occur in the west and north-west of Siilinj√§rvi. The rocks are folded mica schist -like gneisses.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The gabbros of Lapinlahti and Siilinj√§rvi are from the Archean Karelian orogeny. A fine-grained quartz-diorite, which intrudes the surrounding granitic gneiss, is located at the north-eastern side of the Siilinj√§rvi gabbro.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981  Rock types of the complex  Glimmerite. Scanned image of thin section from Siilinj√§rvi apatite ore in cross polarised transmitted light. A drill core sample from Siilinj√§rvi. Five different rocks characterise the Siilinj√§rvi mine: glimmerite-carbonatite series rocks, fenites, diabase dykes, tonalite- diorites and gneisses.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 Apatite is associated with the glimmerite-carbonatites.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 Commonly, carbonatite complexes contain a core of intruded carbonatite which cuts a sequence of phlogopite-rich rocks. In Siilinj√§rvi, however, the glimmerites and carbonatites are well mixed and occur as subvertical to vertical laminated nearly pure glimmerites and nearly pure carbonatites. The volume of the carbonatite is greater in the center of the intrusion, and rocks near the edges of the body are almost completely glimmerites.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015  Ore-bearing rocks  The central ore body comprises glimmerites and carbonatites. The phlogopite-rich ore-bearing rocks vary from almost pure glimmerite to carbonate-glimmerite and silicocarbonates. Carbonatites, which contain more than 50% carbonates, represent only about 1.5 vol% of the main intrusion. These carbonatite rocks are more abundant in the center of the intrusion and they occur as thin veins in glimmerite. The ore body also contains blue-green rocks which are composed up to 50 modal% of richterite.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The main minerals of the ore rocks are tetraferriphlogopite, calcite, dolomite, apatite and richterite. Zircon, magnetite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pyroxenes occur as accessory minerals. The apatite is fluorapatite and the amount of CO2 varies.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 Glimmerite is intensely foliated, greenish black, dark or reddish brown rock (depending on the dominating mica mineral) containing 0-15 % carbonate minerals. The oriented rocks are fine- to medium-grained and usually porphyritic. The matrix is composed of fine-grained, aphanitic phlogopite and the porphyroclasts are tabular phlogopite grains. The fine-grained glimmerites are often more equigranular. The mineral composition of the glimmerites are on average 82% phlogopite, 8% apatite, 7% amphiboles, 2% calcite and 1% dolomite. At some areas, the apatite content is so high that the rock is named as apatite rock (at least 25% apatite). Apatite occurs as grand sized grains in these rocks, and the diameter of the crystals can be up to several decimeters.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 Accessory minerals of the glimmerites include ilmenite, magnetite and pyrochlore.Al-Ani 2013 The carbonate-glimmerites are lighter coloured rocks compared to the pure glimmerites. That is obviously because of the carbonate content (15-25 % carbonate minerals), but also because of the lighter, reddish brown colour of the mica. They are less oriented than the glimmerites and more equigranular. The grain size is medium. The mineral composition of the carbonate-glimmerites are on average 64% phlogopite, 10% apatite, 10% calcite, 9% dolomite and 7% amphiboles.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The silicocarbonates contain 25-50 % carbonate minerals and are quite light coloured, the shade is dependent on the mica colour. The texture is quite similar to the carbonate-glimmerites, excluding the areas, where the carbonates and micas are banded and occur as their own phases. The average mineral composition is 46% phlogopite, 22% dolomite, 19% calcite, 9% apatite and 4% amphiboles, although the amount of calcite should be higher than the one of dolomites.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The accessory minerals of the silicocarbonates include strontianite, barite, zircon, ilmenite and magnetite.Al-Ani 2013 The carbonatitic rocks (> 50% carbonates) in Siilinj√§rvi are brecciated and are mostly composed of calcite, dolomite and apatite. The accessory minerals include phlogopite, ilmenite and magnetite.Al-Ani 2013 Generally, the dolomite content of the carbonate rocks varies quite a lot. The content is mostly very low and the rock consist mainly of calcite, but in some areas, the dolomite content can be as high as 50%. The Siilinj√§rvi carbonates are light grey, white or slightly reddish fine to medium grained rocks with average grain size about 0.9-1.2 mm. These rocks occur commonly as vertical dykes.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981  Fenites  Fenites surround the ore-bearing rocks in the Siilinj√§rvi complex. They were formed metasomatically when the carbonatite-glimmerite rocks intruded into the granite gneiss host. The fenites consist mainly of perthitic microcline, richterite amphibole, and pyroxene, but there also are a wide variety of fenite types that include minerals like pyroxene, amphibole, carbonate, quartz, apatite, and quartz-aegirine.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The fenites are also found as xenoliths in the glimmerite-carbonatites.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The most common fenite type is a reddish or greenish grey rock with varying grain size.Puustinen 1971 Microcline content of the fenites is on average about 50% and the microcline is abundant in perthite. The amount of plagioclase varies much more, and the highest percentages found are about 20-30 %. Anorthoclase content on individual plagioclase grains is 10-15 %. Amphibole percentage is 0-30 % and pyroxene percentage 0-15 % of the rock. Some fenite types contain as much as 15% biotite.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981  Cross- cutting dykes  Basaltic diabase dykes crosscut the entire Siilinj√§rvi complex. Their width varies from a couple of centimetres up to 60 metres. The diabase dykes have a very distinct northwest‚Äìsoutheast or north- northwest‚Äìsouth-southeast vertical orientation.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The diabases are dark green, almost black aphanitic rocks without macroscopic orientation. The hornblende content of the Siilinj√§rvi diabases is 50-70 %, and plagioclase content is 25-40 %. The hornblende is altered to biotite in contact zones, and the plagioclase is albitic. The altered margins of the hornblende dyke are about 50 cm wide. The accessory minerals include titanite, epidote, pyrite, apatite, quartz and zircon.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The preliminary studies show that there are at least three different diabase varieties: calcite-bearing, sulfide-bearing and barren diabase. The sulfide content is higher in the more sheared rocks.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The melasyenite, which crosscuts all the other parts of the complex but the diabase dykes, is composed of alkali feldspar, biotite, alkaline amphibole, apatite, and magnetite. The mafic melasyenite dyke is 4 km long and 20‚Äì30 m wide and appears to have a lamprophyric character.Puustinen 1971 It is located in the northern part of the complex and is possibly related to the same intrusive event as the carbonatite.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015  Minerals of the Siilinj√§rvi intrusion  Most common minerals of the Siilinj√§rvi intrusion are micas, carbonates, apatites and amphiboles. The average composition of the Siilinj√§rvi ore is 65% phlogopite (including tetraferriphlogopite), 19% carbonates (calcite/dolomite ratio 4:1), 10% apatite (equivalent to 4% P2O5 in the whole rock), 5% richterite, and 1% accessory minerals (mainly magnetite and zircon).O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015  Micas  Tetraferriphlogopite grains. Photomicrograph from thin section in cross and plane polarised light. The most common mica mineral in Siilinj√§rvi complex is tetraferriphlogopite, which comprises 65% of the intrusion. Some glimmerites contain over 90% tetraferriphlogopite. The colour of the mineral is black or greenish black, dark brown or reddish brown. The colour is dependent on the host rock and the intensity of the deformation of the rock. The reddish brown mica usually occurs with the carbonate-glimmerites and the black mica occurs with the glimmerites.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 Phlogopites show very strong red-brown to pinkish yellow reverse pleocroism, which is due to high Fe3+ contents.Al-Ani 2013 The phlogopite of Siilinj√§rvi is sold as soil conditioner under the trade name ‚ÄúYara biotite‚Äù. Phlogopite occurs as disseminated flakes, tabular crystals and lamellar or foliated aggregates. The grain size of the micas varies from only a couple of ¬µm to several centimetres, the average size is 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The phlogopite is altered into brown biotite-phlogopite in the shear zones, and in the most intensely sheared zones, into biotite and chlorite.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The most common inclusion mineral in micas is magnetite, but generally the inclusions are rare. Some zircon inclusions can also be found.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981  Carbonates  Carbonate vein. Photomicrograph from thin section in cross and plane polarised light. The dolomite of Siilinj√§rvi is yellowish or brownish white and it is hard to distinguish it from calcite. The most common form of dolomite is roundish anhedral grains with diameter of 0.2-0.4 mm. The dolomites are also found as large, almost euhedral, grains with diameter of 4‚Äì6 mm. Other common textures are myrmekite and exsolution lamellae with calcite. Euhedral grains are only found in carbonatites.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The microprobe studies of Siilinj√§rvi dolomite show homogeneous compositions with low FeO-, SrO- and MnO ‚Äìcontent.Al-Ani 2013  Apatites  Fluorapatite grains in carbonate groundmass. The sample is taken from non-sheared ore, and apatite grains are large, rounded and elongated. Photomicrograph from thin section in cross and plane polarised light. The apatite in Siilinj√§rvi is mainly fluorapatite, but also carbonate-fluorapatite can be found.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 The ore-bearing rocks of Siilinj√§rvi contain roughly equal amounts (about 10%) of light green to grey apatite. The amount of fluorine is about 2-4 wt-% in the Siilinj√§rvi apatite.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The apatites of the mine contain quite high amounts of SrO, and sometimes also CO2. Apatite is found in companion with mica in mica rich rocks and with calcite, dolomite or mica in carbonate-rich rocks.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 Typically, the apatite occurs as rounded grains or as hexagonal prismatic crystals.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The grain size varies from 10 ¬µm to several decimeters in diameter, so the deposit is disseminated. Usually the grain size of apatite is bigger in the carbonates and smaller in the deformed areas. The hexagonal rods and cross sections are sparse in deformed areas, where the grains are disintegrated and broken. The inclusions in the apatite are more abundant in the sheared parts of the ore. The amount is also greater in bigger grains compared to smaller ones. Some grains do not have inclusions at all. The most common inclusion minerals are carbonates, mostly dolomite. Opaques appear also as inclusions, but they are rare.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981  Amphiboles  Almost euhedral amphibole crystal in carbonate groundmass. Photomicrograph from thin section in cross and plane polarised light. The most common amphibole in Siilinj√§rvi is blue- green richterite, which forms about 5% of the overall volume of the intrusion and usually less than 15 vol-% of the glimmerites.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 The greatest percentages of amphiboles are found in the sheared parts of the ore glimmerites, where the percentage can be locally up to 40-50 %. Some carbonatite veins do not have amphiboles at all. The amphiboles of Siilinj√§rvi are usually subhedral and the typical grain size is about 0.1 mm. However, the grain size varies quite a lot, and large crystals with diameter of several centimeters are not uncommon. The largest found crystal clusters are up to 30 cm long. Inclusions are rare and the inclusion minerals are most commonly phlogopite and opaques. Altering of the mineral is uncommon.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981  Accessory minerals  Rutile grains as accessory post-kinematic mineral in highly deformed mica-rich zone. Photomicrograph from thin section in cross and plane polarised light. Magnetite is the most common accessory mineral in the ore rocks, and constitute usually less than 1 vol% of the ore. It is mostly found in the glimmerites.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 Sulfide minerals represented in the ore are pyrite, pyrrhotite, and lesser amounts of chalcopyrite. Sulfides can locally occur in massive form, despite their proportional rarity.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015 Barite, strontianite, monazite, pyrochlore, zircon, baddeleyite, rutile and ilmenite have been identified in Siilinj√§rvi as rare accessory minerals. Barite can occur as intergrowths with strontianite in < 50 Œºm inclusions in calcite. Monazite can be found in two types: <50 Œºm subhedral inclusions in calcite or apatite and slightly larger sub-anhedral grains along grain boundaries. Pyrochlorite exists as inclusions mostly in phlogopite, grains are usually 50‚Äì200 Œºm wide. Zircon occurs as euhedral grains, which vary in size from 100 Œºm up to several centimeters long grains. However, zircon is an uncommon mineral in carbonates because of the low silica activity in the melt. Baddeleyite is found as inclusions in zircon.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015  Geological structures  The dominant foliation dip direction in the S√§rkij√§rvi area is almost N-S (265-275¬∞) and it dips nearly vertically (85-90¬∞) towards west. The strike of the foliation is also the dominant direction of shearing. Other shearing trend is north-west to south-east, but it is weaker. This direction is also the dominating direction of the diabases.H√§rm√§l√§ 1981 Shearing is a common feature in the main Siilinj√§rvi ore body and the contact zone between the country rock and ore body. There are also contact zones which show the primary magmatic contact. Paleoproterozoic diabase dykes crosscut the sheared zone. At least two stages of deformation can be found in the Siilinj√§rvi complex rocks. The deformation took certainly place during the Svecofennian orogeny, but other earlier stages of deformation may have occurred.O‚ÄôBrien et al. 2015  References   Sources  * Al- Ani, T. 2013.

It was primarily an equestrian show with over half the acts involving horses. Thomas Cooke Ernestine Rosa Cooke ‚Äì Weir Collection George Ernest Cooke ‚Äì Weir Collection Thomas Cooke was born in 1752. He founded Cooke's Circus around 1780 which was in Ayrshire in 1784 as a travelling show seen at Mauchline by Robert Burns. Cooke's Circus travelled around cities and large towns in England and Scotland, specialising in equestrian acts, acrobats, strongmen and contortionists, many of whom were from Cooke's extended family. They were one of the more famous \\"circus families\\". Thomas Taplin Cooke Thomas Taplin Cooke was born in Warwick in 1782 the son of Thomas Cooke and his wife, Mary Ann. He took over his father's circus around 1810. In the autumn of 1830, following a pleasurable visit from King William IV and Queen Adelaide, the company adopted the name \\"Royal Circus\\" and retained this name for the remainder of their existence. In 1835 the circus had a semi-permanent structure in Edinburgh (a circular timber structure) at the north end of Lothian Road but this had to be later moved when the Caledonian Railway was built. At this point (c.1850) the circus moved to Nicolson Street, where it was later surplanted by the Empire theatre (now known as the Festival Theatre).By the Three Great Roads, Aberdeen University Press In 1836 he chartered \\"The Royal Stuart\\" from Greenock and two smaller vessels to convey the whole circus to America. 40 of the 130 artists were members of the Cooke family. This extended trip included prolonged programmes in New York, Boston and Walnut Street Philadelphia. At this stage their \\"pattern\\" was to erect a large circular building of a temporary nature (normally in wood). It is unclear how long this American tour was intended to last, but it met an abrupt end during their stay in Baltimore on 3 February 1838, when the Front Street Theater burnt down (note- there is some confusion as two \\"Front Street Theaters burnt down within 5 weeks of each other: Baltimore on 5 Jan 1838, Buffalo on 3 February 1838). The Cooke's lost 50 horses and many items of wardrobe and props in this fire. It appears that the circus had been used to operating from large theatres up to this point. Either during the American tour or following the fire disaster, Taplin Cooke, had a very large circular tent constructed. After a few more months in Philadelphia, he returned to Britain in the summer of 1838 with this large tent, which freed up the possible locations for the circus. One very dramatic equestrian show was \\"Mazeppa\\" based om a poem by Byron, first performed in Philadelphia in 1838 and still playing until at least 1843 when it was showing at Birmingham in England. This concept was borrowed from Andrew Ducrow's show Mazeppa of 1831. In 1846 a similar style of show was based on the life of Dick Turpin. Thomas Cooke died in 1866 in London and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. The grave is highly unique, carrying a statue of a horse \\"mourning\\".https://www.flickr.com/photos/shadow-in-the- water/33736311290https://www.kensalgreencemetery.com/famous-residents/ William Cooke Son of Thomas Taplin Cooke, born in 1808 he was a versatile acrobat and performer before setting up on his own (hiring Astley's Amphitheatre in London) for eleven years as a circus venue. His daughter Alice Maud Mary Ann Cooke married the London-based actor George Benjamin Belmore. James Cooke James Cooke (1810-1869) was an older son to Thomas Taplin Cooke. He appeared as the owner/manager of Cooke's Royal Circus in Edinburgh in 1846 (still a travelling show at this time). His grave in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh describes him as an \\"equestrian manager\\".Cooke family grave, Dean Cemetery John Henry Cooke John Cooke was born in New York in 1837, the son of Henry Cooke during an unsuccessful tour of the family circus in America. He took over the Royal Circus in 1866, following the death of his uncle Thomas Taplin Cooke. Trained as an equestrian juggler in the family circus and toured with them in France and Spain. He also spent some years in other circuses: Astley's, Sanger's and Henry Hengler's. In 1877 John Cooke moved the semi- permanent Edinburgh structure from Nicolson Street to Grindlay Street.By the Three Great Roads, Aberdeen University Press Although still capable of touring, by the 1870s they were largely at a \\"permanent\\" home of a large tent. However, they were forced to vacate this site around 1882 in order for John B. Howard and Frederick W. P. Wyndham to construct a new building (now the Royal Lyceum Theatre). They moved the tent further out of the city towards Fountainbridge. In 1886, John Cooke built the Royal Circus in East Fountainbridge giving a permanent home to the formerly travelling circus. It was designed by George Gilroy and had a central circular performance space surrounded by seating. Its opening night was on 8 November 1886By the Three Great Roads, Aberdeen University Press and he was compered by Harry Dale, a well-known Victorian entertainer and a clown in Cooke's circus. The animals were primarily horses and ponies but also included performing pigeons, dogs and goats!By the Three Great Roads, Aberdeen University Press The circus toured in Leith, Paisley, Greenock, Perth, Aberdeen and Dundee. The non- equestrian acts included \\"La Belle Sylvia West\\", dainty vocalist and dancer, \\"Horton and Onda\\" Chinese comedians, Lily and Elsie Judge and their performing cockatoos.By the Three Great Roads, Aberdeen University Press The circus closed in 1908 and the building was used as a cinema with the screen placed in the centre of the ring. Those viewing from behind paid half price.By the Three Great Roads, Aberdeen University Press The building was remodelled specifically as a cinema, the Palladium Theatre, in 1911 (during Cooke's lifetime). John Cooke died in Edinburgh on 22 August 1917, aged 80. He is buried in Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh.Grave of John Henry Cooke, Dean Cemetery The distinctive grave carries a bronze bust and lies in a northern section of the original cemetery. George Ernest Cooke George Ernest Cooke (1851‚Äì1929) was a famous comedian and character actor. One of the many grandchildren of the founder and cousin of John Henry Cooke. George Cooke went on the second American tour of the 1870s in his twenties and came to fame in this period. George Cooke is buried with John Henry Cooke in Dean Cemetery.

She and her husband, Pang Xunqin, founded the Juelan (Storm) Society, an organization with the mission of spreading the development of modern art in China during the 1930s. Career In 1930, Qiu Ti returned to China and began using painting techniques that she had learned from Japan. These techniques from Japan were considered post-impressionist. She blends the post- impressionist art techniques from Japan and delicate art styles from China to create her own art style. Qiu Ti‚Äôs art style was more modern, challenged conservative concepts, and free-spirited. Most of Qiu Ti‚Äôs artwork that were kept and preserved were oil paintings of landscapes or still life. In these paintings, the application of the paint is more precise than it may seem at first. The different shades of color used in the painting helps it look more realistic but simplified and light at the same time. Taking from the inspiration of post-impressionist techniques, her brushstrokes, which are short and round, are painted in a diagonal angle. The way Qiu Ti painted the middle ground in her artworks had a composition that was commonly used in traditional Chinese landscape paintings. The mixture of the Western brushstroke techniques and the Chinese landscape composition was Qiu Ti‚Äôs painting style. It was uncommon for females to be well-known for painting in the 1930s so Qiu Ti‚Äôs mixture of Western and Chinese art was daring and unique. The still life that Qiu Ti painted seems like random common household objects put together at first glance. The items that were painted are a representation of Qiu Ti‚Äôs domestic environment and her identity as a female in modern China. Her artwork consists of her own life and how it is affected by the world‚Äôs expectation of females in China. Qiu Ti passed away in 1958. Today  Today, Qiu Ti‚Äôs artwork are being auctioned and have been successfully auctioned over the past years. The prices of her artwork can range from $27,582 to $877,682 depending on the medium used and the size of the artwork. In 2002, one of her artworks named Wild Chrysanthemums was sold in Beijing, China in an auction, which had a bid of $877,682.

The mineral is named after Hexiong Yang, a researcher within University of Arizona's Department of Geosciences. Yangite was approved as a valid mineral species by the International Mineralogical Association in 2012. Occurrence Yangite was initially found within a specimen taken from the Kombat mine, located in the Otavi Valley, Namibia. The specimen was obtained from John Innes, a senior mineralogist of the Tsumeb Corporation. Yangite occurs in an ore defined as an epithermal association. This ore type forms with narrow veins composed of galena, rhodochrosite, helvite, and barite. Physical Properties Yangite is colorless, ranging to pale brown when exposed to transmitted light. The mineral has a vitreous luster and streaks white. Yangite maintains a Mohs hardness of five, and demonstrates perfect cleavage along {101}. There is no evidence of twinning or parting within the available specimens. Yangite is sectile, commonly found with bladed or platy habit. The mineral is biaxial, elongated up to 12 mm in length along the [010] axis. Yangite is insoluble in several fluids, including water, acetone, and hydrochloric acid. Chemical composition Yangite has a consistent chemical composition, determined using a CAMECA SX100 electron microprobe. Additionally, the presence of H2O was confirmed using structural determination and Raman spectroscopic measurements. Elemental Weight Percent: {  !element !wt% - Pb 42.08 - O 29.24 - Si 17.11 - Mn 11.16 - H 00.41 - Total 100.0 } X-ray crystallography Yangite was analyzed by both powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Data was collected using the Bruker X8 APEX2 CCD diffractometer. The diffraction data was influenced by severe peak overlap, leading to uncertainty in the resulting index. Powder Diffraction Data: {  !d-spacing !intensity - 7.379 √Ö 100 - 6.648 √Ö 48 - 3.717 √Ö 44 - 3.517 √Ö 38 - 2.992 √Ö 38 - 2.949 √Ö 40 - 2.917 √Ö 65 - 2.907 √Ö 55 } Crystal structure The chain silicate structure is formed by double wollastonite chains. These tetrahedral formations run parallel with the [010] axis and connect with Mn- polyhedra and Pb-polyhedra at the corners. The chains are also defined by four-membered and six-membered alternating tetrahedral rings. Yangite has three Si tetrahedral sites, defined as Si1, Si2, and Si3. Respectively, the average bond lengths are 1.622 √Ö, 1.622 √Ö, and 1.624 √Ö. Yangite is composed of an octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ cation. Within the crystal structure, Pb2+ has a coordination number of five, bonded with O molecules.

The afterglow light emitted soon after the burst was found to be tera-electron volt radiation from inverse Compton emission, identified for the first time. According to the astronomers, \\"We observed a huge range of frequencies in the electromagnetic radiation afterglow of GRB 190114C. It is the most extensive to date for a gamma-ray burst.\\" Also, according to other astronomers, \\"light detected from the object had the highest energy ever observed: 1 Tera electron volt (TeV) -- about one trillion times as much energy per photon as visible light\\"; another source stated, \\"the brightest light ever seen from Earth [to date] ... [the] biggest explosion in the Universe since the Big Bang\\".  Significance  Recent publications following the event indicate that inverse Compton scattering is the mechanism responsible for producing TeV photons. X-ray photons are scattered off of the GRB's polar jets of electrons, which move at 0.9999c. In a scattering event, much of the energy of a relativistic electron is transferred to a photon. Researchers \\"have been trying to observe such very high energy emission from GRB's for a long time, so this detection is considered a milestone in high-energy astrophysics\\". The most recent studies propose, in summary, a model of binary system of hypernova (BdHN I) with two neutron stars, where one of them collapses in a black hole, surrounded by an accretion disk and from whose poles the GRB is launched.

She also wrote under the name Jan Ralston. Biography Agnes Mary Robertson Dunlop was born in Ayr Scotland on 1 January 1901. Her mother was Elizabeth Riddell Dunlop and her father was James Dunlop, a lawyer in the family firm. He was keen on literature, introducing his daughter to the classics and monitoring carefully the books to which she was exposed. He died when she was nine years old but had a lasting influence on her life. As a child she had no particular intention of becoming an author, and when she finished her education became a journalist, first with the Manchester Guardian and then with the Glasgow Herald. She had always enjoyed making up stories and a friend persuaded her to try her hand at writing; her earliest published works were stories in children's annuals. Kyle mostly wrote books for children, producing a stream of titles between the 1930s and 1980. Many of these were historical novels designed for a young audience, with heroines such as Charlotte Bront√´, Mary II of England, Florence Nightingale and Clara Schumann. However, she also wrote several adult novels including The Begonia Bed (1934), The Pleasure Dome (1943), The Tontine Belle (1951), and The Other Miss Evans (1958).

Background  The Ottoman defeat in the Battle of Shaiba in April 1915 had damaged the authority of the Ottomans in the eyes of the Arabs,Charles Townsend, Desert Hell, The British Invasion of Mesopotamia (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010), 90-91. leading to an uprising in Najaf in May 1915. Following their victory, emissaries from Najaf began encouraging an uprising in Hilla.  Uprising  The uprising in Hilla took place in November 1916. The Ottomans put up a desperate fight in the city but found themselves outnumbered by waves of Bedouin and deserters. After the rebels captured the city, the Ottomans sent a punitive force of 4,000-6,000 troops under ‚ÄòƒÄkif Beg. On the 11th, ƒÄkif wrote a letter to Hillah, claiming that he needed to cross the city to get to Nasiriyah. He asked to meet the prominent people of the city to negotiate with them for permission to cross. When the leaders of the city, such as Muhammad ‚ÄòAll al-Qazwinl and others, met them, the Ottomans detained them and declared to the inhabitants of the city that if their crossing through the city to Nasiriyah was opposed, they would kill their hostages.  Aftermath  The residents abided by the Ottoman demands, but Akif reneged on his promise. Ottoman forces hung 128 or 126 people, carried of their women, and killed 1500 in all, as well as deporting \\"thousands\\" of people to Diyarbakƒ±r. This incident served to increase anti-Ottoman sentiment among Arab Shiites, some of whom came to Hilla to aid the rebels, but were too late. Al-Fatlah chieftain Mudbir al-Far'un condemned the Ottoman massacre: Muhammad ‚ÄòAll al-Qazwinl was spared by the Ottomans and lived until 1937.

Early life Mocatta was born on 16 February 1798, and was from a Bristol background.Isidoro Aizenberg, Efforts to Establish a Jewish Cemetery in Nineteenth Century Caracas, American Jewish Historical Quarterly Vol. 67, No. 3 (March, 1978), pp. 224‚Äì232, at p. 230. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press He is recorded as born in London. In a Sephardic family, he was an older brother of Isaac Lindo Mocatta, who was involved in his Venezuelan enterprise in the 1840s, and of David Alfred Mocatta, and son of Moses Mocatta (1768‚Äì1857). In Venezuela Mocatta spent about 15 years in Venezuela, c.1821 to c.1836, and retained long-term financial connections there. He was in Caracas from 1825, and welcomed Sim√≥n Bol√≠var there on behalf of the expatriates in 1827. Political and financial background During this period Gran Colombia broke up into the republics of Colombia (initially as the Republic of New Granada), Ecuador and Venezuela. Mocatta was still involved in managing the affairs of the external debt of Gran Colombia, as divided up between the republics, in the 1850s, acting for the creditors. Also at this period the Foreign Funds market in London flourished briefly and speculatively, launched in 1823 and suffering a crash in 1825. Moses Mocatta was involved in it, and became one of the \\"Spanish bondholders\\" group lobbying in 1827 for the London Stock Exchange to handle and regulate foreign bond dealings.Marc Flandreau, Sovereign states, bondholders committees, and the London Stock Exchange in the nineteenth century (1827‚Äî68): new facts and old fictions, Oxford Review of Economic Policy Vol. 29, No. 4, Sovereign Debt: Lessons from the Past, Reforms for the Future (Winter 2013), pp. 668‚Äì696, at p. 684, note 60. Published by: Oxford University Press Unification of the Foreign Funds and Stock Exchange trading took place in steps, completed by 1835. Commerce The expatriate British in Caracas and La Guaira were not numerous, but they were commercially influential . One of Elias Mocatta's associates was John Boulton (1805‚Äì1875) (see :es:Familia Boulton), a major business figure in early Venezuelan history: Boulton gave Mocatta a power of attorney in 1827. Powles, Ward, Lord & Co. of La Guaira were important in commerce, with George Ward and Henry Joseph Lord acting for John Diston Powles and London partners.Susan Berglund, Mercantile Credit and Financing in Venezuela, 1830-1870, Journal of Latin American Studies Vol. 17, No. 2 (Nov., 1985), pp. 371‚Äì396, at p. 385. Published by: Cambridge University Press Mocatta acted for Mocatta & Co. of Liverpool in commercial matters and handled letters of credit. He built up business relationships with Boulton and Powles trading houses, in La Guaira. He is found in business in Caracas from 1825, firstly with the sale of a vessel. He was Caracas agent for Powles, Ward, Hurry & Co. from 1826 to 1830, and acted also for other firms. E. Mocatta & Co. of La Guaira was set up around 1830. His brother Samuel was in Venezuela in the 1820s, and became involved in the business. Social life Socially, the Mocatta family were on good terms with Robert Ker Porter in Caracas, and Aizenberg comments that it is possible to reconstruct much of their life there from his diary. Later life The partnership of Elias Mocatta, Isaac Lindo Mocatta and Samuel Mocatta was dissolved in 1843. They were commission merchants in Liverpool, and traded as Mocatta Brothers in La Guaira. In 1844 Mocatta became Ecuadorian consul in Liverpool. In October 1847, Messrs. Mocatta & Son, in trade with La Guaira, were reported to have stopped, with liabilities of ¬£50,000. Noting his relationship to Moses, Flandreau points out Mocatta's activity on bondholders' committees for Spanish bonds (1851), Ecuadorian bonds (1853), and Greek bonds (1863).Marc Flandreau, Sovereign states, bondholders committees, and the London Stock Exchange in the nineteenth century (1827‚Äî68): new facts and old fictions, Oxford Review of Economic Policy Vol. 29, No. 4, Sovereign Debt: Lessons from the Past, Reforms for the Future (Winter 2013), pp. 668‚Äì696, at p. 691 and notes. Published by: Oxford University Press Around 1850 he was involved as shareholder in the Marmato Company floated by John Diston Powles. In 1852 he was in Ecuador, as a new representative of a bondholder committee. He arranged a debt moratorium of 20 years, based on vacant land. In 1862, towards the end of the Federal War in Venezuela, Mocatta worked with Hilari√≥n Nadal to help promote a Barings Bank loan to the Venezuelan government. He was subsequently appointed special agent to Barings, to deal with the transition to the post-war administration.Susan Berglund, Mercantile Credit and Financing in Venezuela, 1830-1870, Journal of Latin American Studies Vol. 17, No. 2 (Nov., 1985), pp. 371‚Äì396, at pp. 382‚Äì3.

Early life and education Tjung was born in Sungai Selan, part of what is today Central Bangka Regency of Bangka Island, then part of the Dutch East Indies, on 9 February 1919. He studied at a Recht Hogeschool in Batavia, before heading to the Netherlands to study law in the Leiden University, and he received a Master of Laws degree. Career After Tjung returned to the Indies, he had worked at a telephone company and became a lawyer before being appointed as a deputy prosecutor in Pangkal Pinang's court. He also founded, and later led, the Bangka branch of the Chinese Association. Additionally, he acted as a legal adviser to a Chinese school in Pangkal Pinang. In 1950, he was appointed as a Senator for the newly formed Senate of the United States of Indonesia, representing Bangka. In 1950, following the Senate's dissolution and the defederation of the United States of Indonesia, Tjung was appointed to the Provisional People's Representative Council as a \\"minority representative\\", alongside several other Chinese Indonesian politicians. He joined the Catholic Party in 1953, and he served in the People's Representative Council as a member of that party until 1960. Within that party, he was a member of its central board between 1953 and 1959, and its deputy general chairman between 1956 and 1958. During and after his time in the Council, Tjung served as a director of several mining companies, including at Aneka Tambang where he was its financial director between 1968 and 1974. He died in February 1994. Views Tjung was a proponent of the assimilation of Chinese Indonesians, and was critical of Yap Thiam Hien's writings on discrimination of the group within Indonesia. One example of such a critique was titled Indonesia Bukan Amerika (Indonesia is not the United States), published in 1960, in response to one of Hien's essays earlier that year.

The group received its first Grammy Award nomination in 2020 for Best New Artist at the 62nd awards. History In 2017, singer and songwriter Eric Burton made his way from California to Texas. Born in the San Fernando Valley, he grew up singing in church and then got heavily involved in musical theater. He started busking at the Santa Monica pier, where he brought in a few hundred dollars a day and developed his performance skills. Burton traveled through the Western states before deciding to settle down in Austin, Texas‚Äîsetting up his busking spot on a downtown street corner, at 6th Street and Congress, for maximum exposure. Meantime, Grammy Award-winning guitarist and producer Adrian Quesada was looking to collaborate with someone new. Through a mutual friend, Quesada connected with Burton, Quesada felt that Burton's vocals were a match for the retro-funk- and R&B-flavored; tracks Quesada had been working on, and the two joined forces in 2018 as Black Pumas. Quesada was a member of Latin funk band Grupo Fantasma when it won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album for the 2010 album El Existential, and when it was previously nominated for the same award in 2008 for Sonidos Gold. Working out their material both in the studio and on-stage during a weekly residency at Austin's C-Boys Heart & Soul Bar, they signed a deal with ATO Records and released a pair of singles, \\"Black Moon Rising\\" and \\"Fire\\".  Career  The duo released their debut album, Black Pumas, on June 21, 2019. They performed at South by Southwest in 2019 and won a best new band trophy at the 2019 Austin Music Awards. On November 20, 2019, they were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The album won acclaim from Rolling Stone, who praised ‚Äúthe tireless, charismatic energy of singer Eric Burton,‚Äù Pitchfork, who raved, ‚ÄúThe duo‚Äôs flair for drama is so stirring, they can seem acutely cinematic,‚Äù NPR, The Fader, The Guardian, Billboard, Essence, and many more.

Publication history Covenants is a 64-page softcover book written by Mark Rein-Hagen and Lisa Stevens, with cover art by Doug Shuler. Contents Covenants is a supplement of rules and guidelines for the creation of a \\"covenant\\" (a group or community) of wizards. At the start of an Ars Magica campaign, the characters of all the players at the table are considered to be in the same covenant, so using this book enables the players to act together to design a covenant that best matches the community they all represent. The life cycle of a covenant (spring, summer, autumn, winter) is discussed, and four sample covenants are described. Reception Stewart Wieck reviewed Covenants for White Wolf #20, rating it 4 out of 5 overall, and stated that \\"These covenants are finely crafted, perhaps displaying detail which is beyond players not intimately familiar with the system, but also showing what the system is capable of creating.\\" In the June 1991 edition of Dragon (Issue #170), Ken Rolston thought the book was \\"well written, but of doubtful utility unless you play in an Ars Magica campaign. However, the four sample covenants would make original and entertaining settings for fantasy scenarios in your own campaign.\\" In the 2014 book Dungeons & Designers: The '80s, Shannon Appelcline commented that \\"Ars Magica placed a heavy emphasis on the characters' home ‚Äî the covenant ‚Äî and even gave rules for mechanically defining it. This would later be developed into a full book, Covenants (1990). Part of the innovation of Ars Magica's covenant system was that it was specifically designed to introduce plot hooks into the game, thereby building recurring storylines from the beginning of play.\\" Reviews *Games Review (Volume 2, Issue 10 - Jul 1990) *Review in Games International References Category:Ars Magica Category:Role-playing game books ","title":"Covenants (Ars Magica)"},{"id":"62394769","text":"Idris is a genus of parasitic wasps in the family Platygastridae, containing about 160 described species.Idris References Further reading Category:Parasitic wasps Category:Scelioninae ","title":"Idris (genus)"},{"id":"62394770","text":"DC Comics is one of the largest comic book publishers in North America.

DC has published comic books under a number of different imprints and corporate names. This is a list of all series, mini-series, limited series, one-shots and graphic novels published under the imprints DC or AA, and published by National Periodical Publications, National Comics Publications, All-American Comics, Inc., National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, Inc., and related corporate names, as well as imprints publishing titles directly related to the DC Universe characters and continuity, such as Elseworlds and DC Black Label. The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as Vertigo or WildStorm; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed. While generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, Action Comics has frequently been listed as Action Comics featuring Superman or Superman in Action Comics, or even on occasion Supergirl in Action Comics. The official name, however, is found in the indicia, in small print inside the comics. *List of DC Comics publications (A‚ÄìB) *List of DC Comics publications (C‚ÄìF) *List of DC Comics publications (K‚ÄìO) *List of DC Comics publications (P‚ÄìS) *List of DC Comics publications (T‚ÄìZ) G {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - !

DC has published comic books under a number of different imprints and corporate names. This is a list of all series, mini-series, limited series, one-shots and graphic novels published under the imprints DC or AA, and published by National Periodical Publications, National Comics Publications, All-American Comics, Inc., National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, Inc., and related corporate names, as well as imprints publishing titles directly related to the DC Universe characters and continuity, such as Elseworlds and DC Black Label. The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as Vertigo or WildStorm; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed. While generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, Action Comics has frequently been listed as Action Comics featuring Superman or Superman in Action Comics, or even on occasion Supergirl in Action Comics. The official name, however, is found in the indicia, in small print inside the comics. *List of DC Comics publications (A‚ÄìB) *List of DC Comics publications (C‚ÄìF) *List of DC Comics publications (G‚ÄìJ) *List of DC Comics publications (P‚ÄìS) *List of DC Comics publications (T‚ÄìZ) K {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - !width=22% Title !width=10% Series !width=14% Issues !width=22% Dates !width=32% Notes !Reference -  Kamandi: At Earth's End   #1‚Äì6  Jun 1993 ‚Äì Nov 1993 Elseworlds limited series  -  The Kamandi Challenge   #1‚Äì12  Mar 2017 ‚Äì Feb 2018  Limited series  -  Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth   #1‚Äì59  Oct/Nov 1972 ‚Äì Oct 1978  #60 & 61 appear in Cancelled Comic Cavalcade  -  Karate Kid   #1‚Äì15  Mar/Apr 1976 ‚Äì Jul/Aug 1978   -  Katana   #1‚Äì10 Apr 2013 ‚Äì Feb 2014   -  The Kents   #1‚Äì12  Aug 1997 ‚Äì Jul 1998 Limited series  -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Kentucky Fried Chicken Presents...

DC has published comic books under a number of different imprints and corporate names. This is a list of all series, mini-series, limited series, one-shots and graphic novels published under the imprints DC or AA, and published by National Periodical Publications, National Comics Publications, All-American Comics, Inc., National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, Inc., and related corporate names, as well as imprints publishing titles directly related to the DC Universe characters and continuity, such as Elseworlds and DC Black Label. The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as Vertigo or WildStorm; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed. While generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, Action Comics has frequently been listed as Action Comics featuring Superman or Superman in Action Comics, or even on occasion Supergirl in Action Comics. The official name, however, is found in the indicia, in small print inside the comics. *List of DC Comics publications (A‚ÄìB) *List of DC Comics publications (C‚ÄìF) *List of DC Comics publications (G‚ÄìJ) *List of DC Comics publications (K‚ÄìO) *List of DC Comics publications (T‚ÄìZ) P {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - !width=22% Title !width=10% Series !width=14% Issues !width=22% Dates !width=32% Notes !Reference -  Parallax: Emerald Night   #1  Nov 1996  One-shot  -  Pat Boone   #1‚Äì5  Sep/Oct 1959 ‚Äì May/Jun 1960   -  Peacemaker   #1‚Äì4  Jan 1988 ‚Äì Apr 1988  Limited series.

The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as Vertigo or WildStorm; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed. While generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, Action Comics has frequently been listed as Action Comics featuring Superman or Superman in Action Comics, or even on occasion Supergirl in Action Comics. The official name, however, is found in the indicia, in small print inside the comics. *List of DC Comics publications (A‚ÄìB) *List of DC Comics publications (C‚ÄìF) *List of DC Comics publications (G‚ÄìJ) *List of DC Comics publications (K‚ÄìO) *List of DC Comics publications (P‚ÄìS) T {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - !width=22% Title !width=10% Series !width=14% Issues !width=22% Dates !width=32% Notes !Reference -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  T.H.U.N.D.E.R.

The legislation has been called \\"historic\\" in reaching \\"farther in the legislation process than any other such bill since prohibition\\" of cannabis in the 1930s, and marks \\"the first time in history a congressional committee has approved a bill to end federal marijuana prohibition\\". Provisions The act would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, facilitate the expungement of past convictions, and tax cannabis products at 5% to fund criminal and social reform projects, including an Office of Cannabis Justice within the Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs, responsible for administering grants to aid communities negatively affected by the war on drugs. It would also prohibit the denial of any federal public benefits, like housing, on the basis of cannabis use and states that use or possession of marijuana would have no adverse impact under immigration laws.Text of S.2227, govtrack.us, accessed November 18, 2019 According to USA Today, \\"The trust funds the Act would create include the Community Reinvestment Grant, which would provide funding for services such as job training, re-entry services and legal aid; the Cannabis Opportunity Grant, which would provides funds to assist small businesses in the pot industry; and the Equitable Licensing Grant, which minimizes barriers to gain access to marijuana licensing and employment for those most impacted by the so-called war on drugs.\\" States would maintain their own laws regarding the substance, including whether to legalize it locally. History Matching bills were introduced to the House of Representatives by Jerry Nadler and to the Senate by Kamala Harris on July 23, 2019. Harris was a 2020 Democratic Party candidate for president of the United States at the time and later became the party's nominee for vice president, alongside presidential nominee Joe Biden. The act was passed with a 24‚Äì10 majority by the House Judiciary Committee following markup on November 20, 2019. Only two Republicans voted in favor. The legislation was scheduled for a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health on January 15, 2020, titled \\"Cannabis Policies For The New Decade\\". In August 2020, on the behalf of a long list of civil rights and drug policy activist groups, Vanita Gupta sent a letter to Democratic congressional leaders calling for a vote on the act. The letter states that \\"In the face of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and a growing national dialogue on unjust law enforcement practices, marijuana reform as a modest first step at chipping away at the War on Drugs is more relevant and more pressing than ever before.\\" According to a message released by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn's (D-SC) office, the House will vote on the bill in September 2020. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, in a letter to colleagues, confirmed that the vote would occur by the end of September. This was later delayed until later in the year as a result on needing to focus on COVID-19-related spending.

Patients and their children in receipt of means tested benefits, or on a low income, could get help with the cost of travel to hospital appointments. It does not apply to primary care or community services and it does not apply to visitors. History The legal basis was the National Health Service (Travelling Expenses and Remission of Charges) Regulations SI no 551 of 1988. Before 1988 there was a scheme but there was no statutory basis and the costs incurred were met centrally. From 1988 Health Authorities met the cost of expenditure. Subsequently costs were transferred to NHS trusts. New regulations were introduced by the National Health Service (Travel Expenses and Remission of Charges) Regulations 2003. People who qualified for Income Support or Family Credit qualified for payment of full fares. Others could apply for remission with a means test based on the Income Support rules. Qualifying benefits In 2019 the qualifying benefits are: *Income Support *income-based Jobseeker's Allowance *income-related Employment and Support Allowance *Working Tax Credit with Child Tax Credit, a disability element or a severe disability element *Child Tax Credit for people not eligible for Working Tax Credit *Pension Credit Guarantee Credit *Universal Credit with net earnings of ¬£435 or less in the last Universal Credit assessment period, or with an element for a child, or limited capability for work or limited capability for work and work-related activity, with net earnings of less than ¬£935 People assessed under the NHS Low Income Scheme may qualify for full or partial help. Entitlement Costs reimbursed are normally for the cheapest suitable mode of transport for the patient's circumstances. This may include the cost of a carer, or of accompanying children. In most cases this in will be public transport. If a car is used reimbursement will be for the cost of fuel at the local mileage rate and unavoidable car parking and toll charges. It is not uncommon for the cost of taxi fares to be refused, but they are payable if they are reasonably required. It is possible to get an advanced payment to help attend an appointment. Claims must be made within 3 months. Claims are normally made at the hospital but may be made in arrears, in England, to the Clinical Commissioning Group. Administration Manchester Health Authority produced a report on the working of the scheme in Greater Manchester in 1997. They found a wide variation in the amounts paid out by different hospitals, without any obvious explanation of the differences. Some hospitals were reported as adopting a Poor Law approach. Patients are expect to take proof that they are eligible to a nominated cashiers' office. If they dont have the evidence they may be told to return with it. Many cashiers offices close at 4pm, but patients appointments may be later. The benefit system changes but hospitals may not keep up with the changes.

It extends 600 kilometers east to west and up to 300 kilometers north to south and lies beneath Romania and Bulgaria. Formation and structure The Moesian Platform is made up of four terranes that accreted together during the Ordovician and Devonian as the small continent Avalonia collided with Baltica and Laurentia to form Laurussia. These terrains are sometimes referred to as Caledonian terrains, drawing parallels with the Caledonian orogeny. The North Dobrogea terrane is a fifth, closely related terrane that lies closest to the East European craton, although it accreted last in the Carboniferous. Its current position is inferred to be the result of strike-slip faulting in the Mesozoic with the opening of Mediterranean-style oceanic basins. Romanian Geological Survey borehole data was used to map the Moesian Platform, with results published in 2007 indicating a large southern section, the West Moesian Platform underlying much of the Romanian section of the Danube River and the coastal city of Varna. This structural unit is separated from the Balkan Terrane to the south by Paleogene, Pliocene and Quaternary uplift in the Balkan Thrust Front and to the north from other structural units by the Neogene Carpathian Front. The East Moesian Platform extends up the coast, separated from the West Moesian Platform by the Intra-Moesian Fault. It in- turn is subdivided into the South Dobrogea and Central Dobrogea terranes, split by the Capidava-Ovidiu Fault. The Pecenage-Camena Fault separates these terranes from the North Dobrogea terrane which abuts the Pre-Dobrogean Depression along the Sfantu-Gheorghe Fault in the north.

It was described in 1994 by Austrian entomologist and found in New Britain. Name Malicky did not specify an etymology. However as other new species described in the same paper, such as Ganonema dracula and Anisocentropus golem, seem to reference monsters from central Europe such as Count Dracula and the golem, the specific epithet likely refers to Krampus. Description The distinguishing features of this species are the colorful wings and the male external copulatory organs, especially the laterally protruding lobes of the 10th segment. The designs on the forewing in particular is one of the distinguishing characteristics for this and other related species. The thorax, head, and appendages are light brown with golden yellow hairs. The antennae also are covered in the same gold hairs. The abdomen is dark brown. The forewings are also golden yellow with a wide dark brown transverse band in the lower third and irregularly rounded dark brown spot in the distal third. The forewings are broad in shape with a rounded outer margin, 10 mm long in males and 10‚Äì11 mm in females. The hindwings are dark brown and pearlescent. The ninth segment of the external copulation organs of males are wide with the anterior edge projecting out in the lower third area. On the dorsal side are a pair of long, pointed lobes. The tenth segment bends downwards laterally with two pairs of sharp points. In the dorsoventral view, a pair of lobes extend far outward and only then bent down into points. Yet the caudal pair of spikes is shorter. The pre-anal appendages are long, oval, and erect, and in the cavity of a projecting side lobe of the 9th segment. Laterally the lower appendages are short and triangular, but ventrally they appear long, slender, and directed outwards. Anisocentropus krampus closely resembles Anisocentropus maclachlani, which differs by having brown-black forewings with a yellow Y-shape. It also resembles Anisocentropus tosavos, but the pattern on the forewings also differs. Distribution Anisocentropus krampus is in the Anisocentropus latifasciata diagnostic species group, which has a Gondwanan distribution. The type locality for A. krampus is Kongi (alternatively spelled Komgi) on the Gazelle Peninsula on the island of New Britain in Papua New Guinea at about 1000 m elevation. Four specimens were collected as part of the 1961‚Äì1962 . The holotype and paratypes are kept at the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum.

From 1914 to 1925, Maine used a system of lettered highways to designate cross- state routes. This system was the first of its kind in the United States coordinated by a single state, predating Wisconsin's system by three years. In 1919, this system was supplanted by a series of auto trails officially created by the State Highway Commission, though it is unclear as to whether this system completely supplanted the lettering system. Both systems were abandoned by 1925 in favor of the New England interstate highway system.  List  In 1919, the Maine Automobile Association and the Maine State Highway Commission collaborated to create a series of state-designated auto trails. The system posed a stark contrast to the auto trail systems of other states, which were often private endeavors, with improvements by these booster organizations ranging from simple marked poles to paving and maintenance of the road.

It has been widely studied by Russian and Scandinavian geologists. Formation and geological history The Fennoscandia Shield and its components, the Russian Platform and Baltic Shield make up a large portion of the East European Craton. Crystalline basement rock formed between 2 billion and 1.65 billion years ago, with most activity ending around 1.75 billion years ago. The rocks were then affected by the Svecofennian orogeny. Some of the oldest sedimentary rocks in the Moscow Basin date to the Late Riphean, in the form of siltstone and limestone. During this period the Moscow Rift formed and East European Craton extension followed earlier compression and inversion. A shallow marine environment appeared in the late Vendian extending into the Early Cambrian. By the late Cambrian, deeper marine conditions developed forming shale and siltstone. Carbonates deposited during a return to shallower marine conditions in the Ordovician and Silurian. A discontinuity from the Silurian into the Devonian suggests uplift and a major inversion, followed by off and on carbonate and shale deposition through the Carboniferous and Permian. Large sandstone deposits dating to the Triassic indicate a possible river delta environment. During the Paleozoic and through the Mesozoic the Sukhona Swell and Sukhon Arch formed next to the basin over the earlier Soligalich Graben-Trough.

He made his MLB debut in 2020. Amateur career McKinstry graduated from North Side High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he was a three-time all-conference selection an hit .595 as a junior to be selected to the all-area team. He was rated as the eighth-best prospect in the state of Indiana. McKinstry played college baseball for the Central Michigan University Chippewas. He was named to the 2015 Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American team and in 2016 he was the team co-MVP, while leading the team in batting average, on base percentage and stolen bases. He played for the Waterloo Bucks of the Northwoods League after the 2015 season and the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod League after the 2016 season. While playing for Waterloo in 2015, he learned that his parents house had burned to the ground in a fire. Professional career The Los Angeles Dodgers selected McKinstry in the 33rd round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft, and signed with the team on July 8. After beginning his career by playing four games with the Arizona League Dodgers, he was promoted to the Great Lakes Loons of the Class-A Midwest League, near where he attended college. He hit .261 in 41 games for the Loons and helped them win the league championship. In 2017, he played 17 games for Great Lakes, 82 for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and 15 for the Tulsa Drillers. Overall, he had a .239 batting average. He returned to the Loons to start 2018, but maintained a positive attitude about the demotion and improved his batting average and his walk ratio. He played in only 76 games in 2018, across the same three levels, with a .282 average while spending time on the disabled list. McKinstry began 2019 with Tulsa, where he increased his power numbers and was selected to the mid- season all-star team. After hitting .279 with 12 homers and 52 RBI in 95 games for Tulsa he was promoted to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers of the Pacific Coast League on August 3. With Oklahoma City, he played in 26 games with a .382 average. The Dodgers added him to their 40-man roster after the 2019 season. McKinstry was called him up to the majors for the first time on August 5, 2020. However, he was optioned the following day without appearing in a game.

An ISO has relevant experience with clinical trials as well as with the patient population and intervention being studied. Clinical trials using an ISO are usually smaller, single-site trials with a moderate to minimal risk intervention.  Need for an ISO  Safety surveillance of a clinical trial should be in proportion to the risk and complexity of the trial. Large, multi-site clinical trials are commonly overseen by a Data Monitoring Committee or Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of expert clinicians, biostatisticians, and ethicists or patient advocates. Small, minimal risk studies may be monitored by the principal investigator according to the data and safety monitoring plan (DSM plan) approved by the institutional review board (IRB). For clinical trials with intermediate complexity or risk, the use of an ISO can be very helpful to monitor the trial for research participant safety, adherence to the protocol, and collection of good data. Examples of studies monitored by an ISO might include a trial involving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs used in unapproved indications, non-significant risk medical devices, nutritional products used as a drug, research-only interventions such as an insulin clamp, or behavioral interventions with the possibility of psychological adverse events. Monitoring by an ISO may also be appropriate for higher risk single-site studies of short duration, such as pilot studies, for which convening a full DSMB is not feasible.  Job characteristics  An ISO is usually a physician or investigator with experience and training in both the disease and the intervention being studied. This allows the ISO to assess the safety of the research participants throughout the course of the trial. In addition, an ISO has experience with clinical trials so that they can monitor the progress of the trial for adequate enrollment, appropriate follow-up, adherence to protocol, and good data collection. Finally, the ISO is independent of the clinical trial they are monitoring. They are not a part of the study team and have no financial or scientific conflicts of interest with the clinical trial or the principal investigator.  Responsibilities  The DSM plan, which is approved by the IRB before a trial begins, will stipulate the use of an ISO for monitoring. In addition, the specific responsibilities of the ISO for that trial are defined by the ISO charter written by the principal investigator and the ISO. The charter typically sets out the aspects of the trial that will be reviewed, the frequency of data review and written reports, a plan for adverse event identification and reporting, a plan for monitoring of data quality and accuracy, and the criteria for decision-making regarding continuation, modification or termination of individual participants or the clinical trial. An ISO meets regularly with the principal investigator and study team to review the progress of the trial. In these meetings, the ISO discusses: 1) a review of any adverse safety events; 2) protocol deviations and exclusions; 3) enrollment and follow-up of participants; 3) missing data and data quality controls; 4) any new medical advances that may require changes in the study protocol. The timing of the meetings depends on the risk to the participants as well as the degree of oversight needed for a particular trial. If a clinical trial has regulatory lapses, excessive adverse events linked to the trial intervention, or fails to recruit adequate numbers of participants, the ISO may recommend that the clinical trial protocol be modified or the trial terminated. Occasionally, additional expertise beyond the ISO is needed to accomplish a comprehensive review. With additional personnel, this is considered a Safety Committee. Most frequently a biostatistician will be the additional reviewer. Other additions can include a content expert for nonclinical issues, a methodology consultant, or another clinician that has additional specific expertise.

They have a relatively large geographical distribution and are a known pest of many agricultural ‚Äúcash‚Äù crops such as cocoa, cashew, and tea. Subsequently, their impact negatively influences economic growth within the regions in which they inhabit. Thus, their impact on humans has caused them to be of great interest biologically, resulting in significant environmental implications.  Distribution  Helopeltis antonii are found in a region known as the old-world tropics which encompasses places such as India, Northern Australia, Guinea, Vietnam, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Indonesia.Rebijith, K. B., R. Asokan, N. K. K. Kumar, K. K. Srikumar, V. V. Ramamurthy, and P. S. Bhat. 2012. DNA Barcoding and Development of Species- Specific Markers for the Identification of Tea Mosquito Bugs (Miridae: Heteroptera) in India. Environmental Entomology 41:1239‚Äì1245Srikumar, K. K., P. S.

Proceedings of the Zoological Society 68:30‚Äì35 More specifically, they are more concentrated in the agricultural regions of the old-world tropics. In India their distribution is primarily found within the ‚Äúcashew belt‚Äù which is located along the western coast and central regions of the country due to its high affinity for these plants. However, different nations grow certain crops in various locations within their borders. Crops that H. antonii prefer will ultimately determine their specific distribution within a country.  Identification of distribution  H. antonii are often mistaken and misidentified with other Helopeltis species. Thus, identifying the exact geographical range of H. antonii has become a difficult process. However, recent advances in species identification though DNA barcoding has made it much easier. DNA barcoding is a rapid and relatively inexpensive identification technique that locates unique genetic markers in their DNA allowing for the accurate identification of not only H. antonii, but other species as well.  Mating  Reproduction for H. antonii occurs in 4 stages‚Äîarousal, mounting, copulation, and termination of copulation‚Äîand occurs year-round.Devasahayam, S. 1988. Mating and Oviposition Behavior of Tea Mosquito Bug Helopeltis antonii Signoret Heteroptera Miridae. The Journal of The Bombay Natural History Society 85:212-215Srikumar, K. K., and S. P. Bhat. 2016. Pronotal Color Morphs and Influence of Weather Parameters on Population Trends of the Capsid Bugs, Helopeltis antonii and H. bradyi in Cashew Ecosystem. Entomologia Generalis 35: 269-279 Mounting, arousal, and termination of copulation occurs within a short time frame; copulation is much longer and more variable in length. Mating typically occur in shaded, covered areas  Arousal  Arousal consists of both chemical and tactile stimuli. Pheromones play an important role in the chemical attraction of females for mating. Although these chemical cues are important, physical cues comprise the bulk of mate attraction and arousal. Males are the sole initiators for reproductive encounters. This first done through sexual identification of a female partner. Sexual identification is only possible when in close proximity of each other. Once a female is located, the male makes contact with the female by gently probing her body with his antennae. Receptive females remain passive, permitting the male to proceed. In contrast, non-receptive females move to escape any further male interaction.  Mounting  Following the initial arousal, the process of mounting ensues. Males mount females on the posterior region of her body allowing the erect male rostrum to stroke the dorsal side of the female, just below the thoracic shield. This stroking behaviour quiets the female and allows for easier insertion of the male aedeagus into the female genital aperture. If insertion is not achieved the male begins a left to right stroking motion to aid in its insertion. Females can also kick or shake males off to prevent further progression of mating. When this occurs, males are quick to remount and re-attempt insertion of their aedeagus into the female genital aperture. Successful insertion leads to copulation.  Copulation  Once insertion has been established the male twists around in an end-to-end fashion to allow for copulation. Once in this end-to-end position both the male and female remain still until copulation has completed. This can last anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours.  Termination of copulation  Following copulation, they abruptly disjoin, however, detachment can be often difficult due to the males twisted position. Once separated both the male and female begin to feed and clean their own genitals and antenna‚Äîthis feeding and cleaning behaviour typically occurs within a few steps from the site of copulation. Females do not respond to any other mating advances immediately following copulation. However, females typically reproduce more than once during their lifetime.Siswanto., R. Muhamad, D. Omar, and E. Karmawati. 2009. The Effect of Mating on The Eggs‚Äô Fertility and Fecundity of Helopeltis antonii (Heteroptera: Miridae). Tropical Life Sciences Research 20:89-97Interspecific mating has been known to occur between Helopeltis species, specifically between H. antonii and H. theivora. However, their mating result in the production of unviable eggs.Bhat, P., and K. K. Srikumar. 2013. Genitalia Structure Examination for Interspecific Mating of Helopeltis antonii and H. theivora. Current Science 105:23-25 The production of eggs following interspecific mating between H. antonii and H. bradyi has not been observed. This ability and inability to engage in interspecific mating is due to the difference in genital structure between females. Females of both H. antonii and H. theivora have sclerotized rings that are not fused, whereas, the females of H. bradyi have fused sclerotized rings in its genitalia. This difference acts like a ‚Äúlock and key‚Äù model for genitalia.  Oviposition  Males and females are able to reproduce and lay viable eggs after their first day of sexual maturity. Unmated females are capable of laying eggs; however, they are sterile. The sex ratio of males to females does not influence the number of eggs a female can lay but environments with a high ratio reduces female longevity due to mating exhaustion. Females that reproduce more than once lay a larger number of eggs during oviposition. Females probe plant tissues with the tip of their rostrum to find a suitable site for the deposition of their eggs. The exact reason behind site choice is unknown, but once found the female bends her abdomen to establish contact between her ovipositor and the plant tissue. The ovipositor is then inserted into the plant tissue and the eggs are deposited, below the epidermis and parenchymatous tissue of the plant, via abdominal contractions. The eggs are ovo-elongate and slivery-white in colour and are approximately 1.0x0.3mm in size. Abundance of eggs laid is also weather dependent. Conditions that yield higher temperatures and increased sun exposure result in a higher abundance; whereas cooler temperatures, less available sunlight, and increased rain exposure reduces abundance.  Development  H. antonii experiences partial metamorphosis, otherwise known as hemimetabolous development, which is characterized by it transition from an egg to nymph and eventually into a matured adult.Visalskshy, N. P., C. Swathi and L. Frenita. 2019. Studies on the Biological Parameters of Helopeltis antonii Sign. (Hemiptera Miridae) on Psidium guajava L. Pest Management in Horticultural Ecosystems 25:32-36 This developmental pattern takes about 25 days from the time the eggs are laid to adulthood. The eggs take eggs 12‚Äì13 days to hatch followed by 12‚Äì13 days of progressive nymph instars. H. antonii experience 5 instars in total before reaching adulthood. During the first instar, the body appears light orange in colour and progresses to a deep orange in the second instar. During the third instar, the body beings to develop wing buds and a scutellar horn. Wing pads become visibly prominent as the fourth instar emerges. Finally, in the fifth instar, the wing pads cover half of the abdomen‚Äîwith the wings being transparent‚Äîand the body is light brown in colour but darkens via sclerotization. Additionally, in the fifth instar, the dorsum of the thorax appears red in colour, the tergum of the abdomen a dull white, the dorsal abdominal segment a deep orange colour, and overlapped hemi-elytra covers over the abdomen with its distal end containing a triangular blackish-brown colouration. The less-matured first, second and third instars tend to group close to each other and remain in proximity of their hatch site for feeding. In contrast, the more matured fourth and fifth instars tend to be more dispersed and feed in areas farther from their hatch site as a result. Matured females have a characteristic white patch present on their fifth abdominal segment.  Environmental influence  Although colouration is an important identifying feature of H. antonii it is subject to variation due to variations in temperature and sunlight exposure. Red colour morphs tend to peak in abundance during October and reach their minimum abundance during February (for males) and June (for females). Black colour morphs peak during June for both sexes. A brownish-black colour morph is also seen within the population, but its abundance is low, and its frequency remains constant throughout the year.  Diet and feeding  H. antonii are herbivorous insects that have been known to feed on more than 100 different plant species. The sites of feeding, on these plant hosts, are not localized. Rather, both adult and nymphs feed on various sites ranging from tender shoots, buds, stems, and even their fruiting bodies to obtain sap.Visalskshy, N. P., C. Swathi. 2016. Host Range and Off- Season Survival of Tea Mosquito Bug, Helopeltis antonii Sign. Pest Management in Horticultural Ecosystems 22:134-136 H. antonii possess modified mouthparts which work to form a long straw-like structure known as a ‚Äústylet‚Äù. This modified mouth part enables them to suck up sap from deep within the plant tissues that would not otherwise be as easily accessible.  Seasonal Consumption  H. antonii feed on both native plants as well as agriculturally grown crops. However, their availability changes with the seasons. This change in availability is due to the different growth cycles host plants experience throughout the year. As host plants enter their fruiting or flushing stages, they begin to have a higher rates of sap production and as a result become targeted by H. antonii. In native, non- cultivated, habitats there appears to be a preference for certain types of host plants even when many others are present. During January to February Annona is preferred, from March to April neem is preferred, from May to August papaya is preferred, and from September to December Singapore cherry is preferred. In addition to the consumption of native plant species, agricultural ‚Äúcash crops‚Äù such black pepper, cashew, cocoa, and tea as are often at high risk for consumption and damage due to their large-scale cultivation and ease of accessibility. However, their feeding schedule on these is agricultural crops are more restricted based due to growing and harvest seasons.  Plant preference  Like the seasonal preference of plants, preference is also seen in consumption habits of fruits with respect to different plants. For example, in custard apples the immature fruits are preferred over the matured fruits. Whereas in the Singapore cherries there is no observed feeding preference for immature or mature fruits.  Biological mechanics  Feeding requires the insertion of their stylet into the plant tissues. This insertion results in the secretion of saliva. Present within their saliva are toxic substances that cause death of plant tissues following feeding. However, the biochemical understanding of the toxin's toxicology and function within the saliva is poorly understood and is a site of current research.Varma, V. R., M. Balasundaran. 1990. Tea Mosquito (Helopeltis antonii) Feeding as a Predisposing Factor for Entry of Wound Pathogens in Cashew. Entomon 15:249-251  Predators  Being a pest to many agricultural crops, resulting in severe destruction of plants following their consumption, have since made H. antonii a major target in hopes to reduce their prevalence in the agricultural industry. The use of insecticides and pesticides have long been used in an attempt to manage and reduce the damaging effects of H. antonii feeding. However, the effectiveness of these chemicals are concentration and volume dependent with respect to the type being used.Syarief, M., A. W. Susilo, T. Himawan, and A. L. Abadi. 2017. Diversity and Abundance of Natural Enemies of Helopeltis antonii in Cocoa Plantation Related with Plant Pattern and Insecticide Application. Pelita Perkebunan 33:128 Some of these pesticides have a prevalence of 500 liters per hectare at concentrations ranging from 50g/L-500g/L. The use of such chemical agents poses a risk not only to the environment but to humans as well‚Äîas exposure and administration levels continue to increase so too does its level of toxicity. Additionally, many countries that import these crops do not import those that have traces of pesticides.Srikumar, K. K., P. S. Bhat, K. Vanitha, K. Rajmohana, and T. N. Raviprasad. 2014. Phenology and Parasitization Behaviour of Telenomus cuspis (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) an Egg Parasitoid of Helopeltis antonii (Hemiptera: Miridae) in Cashew. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India Section B: Biological Sciences 85:437‚Äì442 Thus, natural predators and parasitoids have been looked to for their biological control properties to prevent the use of these harmful chemicals.  Biological control  H. antonii are subject to both predation and parasitism via parasitoids. Parasitoids of both nymph and adult morphs include Hymenoptera (Braconidae, Platygastridae) and Diptera (Sarcophagidae). Predators are more extensive in diversity and consist of Hymenoptera (Formicidae, Vespidae), Coleoptera, Mantodea, and Odonata. Of specific interest and use are hymenopteran parasitoids, specifically, Telenomus cupis due to their high specificity and specialization on H. antonii eggs. The employment of these parasitoid specialists has significantly decreased the abundance of H. antonii eggs to effectively reduce their devastating impact on agricultural crops. Additionally, these hymenopteran parasitoids are one of the few parasitoids that are active year-round. The combined use of pesticides and biological control agents are less effective in reducing the number of H. antonii within agricultural systems. This is because these pesticides also act against biological control agents‚Äîreducing their effectiveness. Additionally, the biological control agents tend to be more affected by pesticides than H. antonii. Biological predators and parasitoids are more affected than H. antonii due to their increase locomotory abilities causing them to be exposed to larger amounts of the synthetic pesticides found on crops. The extensive and prolonged use of pesticides and its lesser effect on H. antonii, when compared to its biological control agents, raises concerns regarding pesticide resistance. However, such evidence has yet to suggest the acquisition of pesticide resistance in H. antonii.  Ecological and economic damage  H. antonii foraging behaviour, especially on commercially produced crops, has devastating impacts on overall crop yields showing yield reduction of as much as 35-75 percent. As more of the native landscape becomes converted into agricultural lands it provides an increased food supply for them. This increased food supply allows for an increase in population. As their population increases more plant tissues are subject to damage and injury. Thus, injured plants are no longer able to allocate their desired resources into fruit/seed production, rather, they are forced to allocate resources and energy into damage control and repair. This alternative allocation of resources is what causes the observed yield reductions. Poor yields result in poor economic outcomes for producers which also has adverse consequences for consumers such as increased prices, as well as an overall reduction in the number and overall quality of available products. Foraging behaviour of H. antonii causes necrotic lesions to develop on plant tissues at feeding sites which can cause the death to new plant buds. Bud death inhibits plants from producing fruit‚Äîdecreasing yield. Similarly, feeding on premature and mature fruits causes fruit desiccation resulting in a reduction in size and quality‚Äîas seen in cashew plants.  Fungal contribution  Although feeding results in necrotic lesioning and desiccation, it is not the only factor that impacts yield. Following foraging, fungal pathogens can enter the wound tissues more readily and cause die-back of shoots and is the primary cause of inflorescence blight. Even though fungal blight is a common occurrence in various plants, the wounds caused by H. antonii in plant tissues exacerbates and accelerates its effects. Die-back from blight also limits the plants ability to produce products and grow‚Äîfurther perpetuating yield loss.

Everett was a cover-artist and illustrator for books and national magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, Ladies‚Äô Home Journal, and Scribner‚Äôs. During his early career, Everett was a student of Howard Pyle (‚ÄòThe Father of American Illustration‚Äô) at both the Drexel Institute and Brandywine School as well as a contemporary of N.C. Wyeth. Among the first wave of commercial illustrators in America, students taught by Pyle in the Brandywine School are credited with setting the standards for future American illustrators and often attributed key influences on such artists as Maxfield Parrish and Norman Rockwell. Staples of the Brandywine style included taking inspiration from U.S. culture and the artists' personal lives. Students of Pyle were encouraged to train hard, spiritually and artistically, to study first-hand the environments they painted and to utilize authentic props. Later in his career, Everett helped to found the Philadelphia School of Industrial Art's Illustration Department and was an instructor to Norman Rockwell. Little is known about Everett's final years, however it is known that he burned a large portion of his works that he considered personal projects. After his death his son, Oliver Everett, discovered a collection of 25-30 original oil paintings on canvas that had been rolled up in a barn on his property. These works remain in the Everett family and are understood to be the largest single collection of Walter H Everett's work.

The name originated in the 19th century, meaning a lowland or low place. Vake is a settlement that originated on the territory of Old Vera. By the beginning of the 20th century, its borders were: to the east Varaziskhevi, to the north - Vere River, south and southwest - mountain skirts. During this period, the development of Tskneti Street (now Petre Melikishvili Street) reached Varaziskhevi with a small bridge over it. In Tbilisi Development plan of 1906 only the Nobility Gymnasium building is mentioned in this area (currently 1st building of Tbilisi State University). Then Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary was built not far from the gymnasium (later on this building became agricultural institute, now it is one of the clinics of Tbilisi State Medical University [formerly the 9th Hospital]). Since January 1906, Vake was incorporated into Tbilisi. Intensive construction began in the 1920s. For a long time, this neighbourhood was connected to the center of Tbilisi only by Melikishvili Street. In 1957, as a result of reconstruction of the lower part of Varaziskhevi, it became connected to Heroes Square. In 1958, Vake-Saburtalo Connection Highway (currently Mikheil Tamarashvili Street) was also constructed. Currently, Vake is one of the largest residential areas of Tbilisi. There are also high schools, research centers, administrative institutions, etc. In 1946, Vake Park was opened (formerly Victory Park, Architect K. Dgebuadze, Dendrologist N. Tsitsishvili). In 1982, Childrens' park and recreation park Mziuri was opened.

She is currently one of the last surviving rebels of the Naxalbari movement. Shanti Munda is remembered as a prominent female leader within this movement who worked along side significant Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders including Kanu Sanyal. Her experience as the daughter of a poor peasant exposed her to the exploitation and oppression of the Indian peasantry and inspired a life of active resistance.  Biography   Family  Shanti Munda was born in Hatighisa, as a member of the Munda tribe in the Darjeeling district of India . Although there is no reliable record of her birth date, during a 2017 interview Munda stated that she believed she was in her 74th year of life . Munda was born to a poor peasant family and lived with her mother, father, brother, and sister. Her family owned 18 bighas of land. Under Indian laws at that time, peasants were forced to pay a large portion of their cultivations to the jotedar's. The payment that Indian peasants paid to land owners was dependent on the size of the land they were faming. Munda's father worked on 14 bighas and would pay the jotedars 18 maunds (equivalent to around 27 kg) of paddy .  Political Exposure  Due to the economic stagnation felt by her family due to harsh Indian land laws, Munda's father was unable to fully feed and support his family and was forced to work on Khyapachand Biswas's land as a share cropper . This was not uncommon, as sharecroppers like her father usually worked 2-3 job in order to support their families. Munda's father also has a history of involvement in Indian government. Beginning as a volunteer of the Indian National Congress, he later became a follower of Kanu Sanyal after Sanyal initiated frequent visits to their villages. Sanyal worked with Kesab Sarkar to establish a night school in the surrounding area. It was there that Munda eventually became a student and began forming important relationships with prominent Indian Communist leaders. Munda recently described her early political year in a recent 2017 interview: > ‚ÄúIt is a tale that goes back half-a-century. I was then a girl of 12 or 13 > years. I was connected with the undivided Communist Party from that age. I > Became a member of the women's association. I accompanied women leaders like > Chaya Dey, Chaitannya Sanyasi‚Äôs wife, Kalu Doctor and Leela Majumdar to > Champashari and Mallaguri area. Charu Mazumdar owned land there. I saw him > distribute his land among the sharecroppers. I was a witness. Ladhi Majhi > and Shakhi Majhi were the two sharecroppers. It was the time of the Tebhaga > movement. The peasant worked tirelessly on the land, but would get nothing. > This was unacceptable. The tebhaga had taken place in Jalpaiguri earlier, > now it would also take place in Terai.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven though I was only a little > girl, I used to go for every rally. It used to be great fun singing and > dancing. Sometimes, the rally would be held from the morning till the > evening. I learnt politics from these rallies.\\"  Personal Life  In the 1960s, Kesab Sarkar was known to frequently visit Shanti Munda's family home to pick up various fruits that they would grow in their garden. As a well known figure, the community gossiped about the relationship he had formed with Munda. Sarkar was 40 years old at the time while Munda was 15, and when Sarkar eventually asked for her hand in marriage, Munda's father disapproved. Regardless, Kanu Senyal planned the wedding which would take place in Dahru Rajgore's home in Choupukhuria. When talking about her father's reaction to the marriage, Munda recalled: > ‚ÄúAlmost everyone came to the wedding, but there was no one from my house. My > father Digan Munda, could never understand why Kesab Sarkar would want to > marry a tribal girl. Further, he did not know how his own community would > react to this marriage. He strongly believed that his daughter‚Äôs marriage to > Kesab Sarkar would never be accepted by his tribe. At first, he was so angry > at the news that he wanted to kill Keshab with an arrow. He wanted to move > the court against him. My father loved me enormously. At times I feel my > father died before his time worrying for me.\\"  Political Career  Shanti Munda officially joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 1965 after its split from the Communist Party of India in 1964 following fundamental ideological disagreements. During this time she was extremely active within the party, frequently holding and attending meetings and marches. She was known as an engaged leader who lead a number of social efforts such as the digging and creation of wells for safe drinking water and raising of money to give to families who had no money to marry off their daughters. Munda was also known to be frequently moving back and forth between villages to settle various disputes and conflicts between the peasants and the land owners. Naxalbari Movement  The Naxalbari movement was a peasant revolt in 1967 in a small village in the Darjeeling district in West Bengal, Naxalbari. The movement was lead by peasants living in Naxalbari who largely worked on tea plantation on large estates who had experienced oppression and exploitation at the hands of the landowners and moneylenders for centuries and attempted to reclaim the land they worked on.  Roots of the Movement  There is a long history of armed peasant rebellions in India that dates back to the initial British conquest for Indian land. Indian political independence however, provided no real change for the oppressed class of peasants. The oppression of low income Indians with no real political assistance lead to the development of a Communist Party of India. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) developed their own program following their split from the Communist Party of India at the 7th Congress of the C.P.I (M) in Calcutta in 1964, detailing the specific strategies and goals of the party. The program characterized the Indian state as \\"the organ of the class rule of the bourgeoisic and landlord, led by the big bourgeoisie who are increasingly collaborating with foreign finance capital in pursuit of the capitalist path of development\\" Further, it pushed for \\"the replacement of the present bourgois-landlord state and government by a state of people's democracy and a government led by the working-class on the basis of a firm worker-peasant alliance.\\" This program became the leading doctrine for the peasant rebellion. In March of 1967, Munda attended a large peasants conference was held in the Rambhola jote supported by the Siliguri sub- division of the C.P.I (M) leadership in the Darjeeling district. The leaders of the conference called for \\"the ending of monopoly ownership of land by the landlords, redistribution of land through peasants' committees and organization and arming of the peasants to destroy the resistance of landlords and rural reactionaries\\"  Naxalbari Uprising  Following the conference, peasants and workers in the Naxalbari Village lead by Charu Majumda, Kanu Sanyal, and Jangal Sathal initiated an armed struggle to redistribute land back to the landless. By May of 1967, these peasants had established control in the Naxalbari, Kharidari and Phansidewa regions in the Darjeeling district. There were no major clashes between the police and the until May 24th when what Munda calls \\"the incident of Jhadu jote\\" took place. In certain areas the police had attempted to protect the landlords' interests and would enter the villages and interrogate the men living there. When describing the night of the 24th, Munda recalls: > \\"Perhaps the police had information that the leaders of the movement had > assembled there. They mounted a raid on the village to arrest everyone in > one fell swoop. When the villagers heard that the police were coming, they > all grabbed whatever they could find, like and sharp or heavy household > utensils and material that could be wielded as a weapon, their bows and > arrows, and rushed to Jharu jote. It was like everyone from every home of > the village and the surrounding ones had rushed in. Peasants, tea garden > labour, their families, neighbors, everyone fathered in the field. Sonam > Wangdi dies shot by an arrow‚Äù Munda lead this charge along with other notable leaders with her child on her back, just 15 days after giving birth. When asked about this day in a recent 2017 interview, Munda recalled: > \\"my youngest daughter was just 15 days old at that time. I tied her to my > back and ran over to Jhoru jote. Women formed a circle and surrounded the > police. Goodness! So many people! This otherwise green stretch of land was > invisible under out feet. Everyone had come! Everyone! Men, women, the > young, the elderly, even toddlers and infants, everyone! Like ants, a sea of > humanity covered the whole field. Nothing could be seen beyond the dark > heads that seemed to carpet the entire group. So many had gathered for this > one cause and this one fight? Unbelievable! I hadn't seen anything like this > before. I don't think even my forefathers had experienced anything like > this. Khokan Majumda, Phani Master, and Lasa Kheroya were the leaders > present on that day. There were a few other leaders too, but I cannot quite > recall who they were.\\" Due to the fact that Munda had just given birth only 15 days prior, she became extremely ill in the following days. Although she was able to run to the Jhoru jote the previous day with the other women, she was unable to leave her home for days to follow. The day following the May 24th incident, police attempted to force their way into the surrounding villages. The female villages gathered around the police and their vehicles, many able to take guns away from the officers. An agreement was reached where if the women agreed to return the guns back to the officers, they promised to leave the area. The women complied, but after a short amount of time the police began shooting at unarmed women and children resulting in the death of 11 villagers.  Post Naxalabri Movement   Backlash  After the May 24th and 25th incidents, major Naxalabri leader and husband of Shanti Munda, Kesab Sharkar was forced to go underground. He fled to Bihard and when he later returned to Dagapur where he was immediately arrested. Following this and the death of her close comrades, Munda and her young daughter went into hiding, finding shelter in Lataguri. Although she was in hiding, she was maintained her political work, frequently attending meetings at night. Although the movement received global recognition and support, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) did not approve of the actions of the Naxalabri's. They quickly discharged major members who had supported the uprising. This included leaders like Charu Majumdar, Souren Bose and Dilip Bagchi. But, these leaders did not abandon their political work. They went on to form their own branch of a Communist Party, The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). After five years of hiding and secretive political work, Shanti Munda returned home. > \\"Five years I was away. I returned to the Mallaguri area 5 years later > because my son had taken ill. I did not know where comrade Kesab Sarkar was. > My house in Mallaguri had been illegally occupied by a person. I had 5 katha > of cultivable land; that too was taken away because I did not have the > adequate money to get it registered. I was completely destitute - homeless > and landless. Adding to my isolation, my mother-in-law passed away. The > death of my brother-in-law followed. I had no news of my husband. I felt > very sad and alone..on seeing my abject condition the local CPI (M) and > Congress people got together and offered me a job. I accepted it! I could > barely make ends meet, but I still managed. Since I did not have any roof to > live under, I used banana leaves, ute, and gunny sacks to weave a cover and > make a fragile hut. That was all I could manage. Sometimes I thought, what > did I do with my life? I was just 12-13 when I devoted myself to this > cause..so many years. What do I have to show for it? It pains me. Yes, it > saddens me. Yet, I never quit. I never let the Party. Not even now! I stand > next to them, shoulder-to shoulder. I haven't stopped fights for the people > I am with them. I am the party!\\"  Recent Years  On March 23 2010, Shanti Munda experienced what she has deemed one of the largest tragedies of her eventful life, the suicide of her leader, Kanu Sanyal. In her own words she describes: ‚ÄúI pushed open the window and peeped in. Kanu dada is not there on his bed. Where is he? The rope line on which he used to hang his soiled shirt and dhoti is also missing. And then I saw dada hanging from the ceiling on the rope. I screamed.‚Äù Today, Munda lives with her daughter in law and grandchildren not very far from the site where the uprising took place many years ago. Munda is still an avid advocate for the same issues she fought for 50 years ago, but believes that same spirit has not been preserved in future generations, saying that \\"this generation doesn't care for [their] struggles...I have been bombarded with media interviews, but what the point of them. This generation will never understand Naxalbari. They are all fed dreams of capitalism\\" Specifically, Munda is referring to the effects of modernization, and modern day capitalism. \\"Today children are manual laborers in cities. Our son's work as a carpenter in Siliguri, they bring home some money on some days..on other days we go to sleep hungry. Another worry for Munda in the modern day is the excessive saffronisation of rural Bengal. \\"How can we buy into their false promises. They divide us in the religion. They are more concerned with protecting cattle than people. Why has the nation's discourse stooped to this level?\\" Despite all of this, Munda still has faith in the resurrection of the Naxalbari movement at the hands of the most recent generation of children. \\"My granddaughter is into athletics. She lost her father when she was very young but she never stopped dreaming. Every morning, she wakes up before the crack of dawn to train, then she cycles to her college in Siliguri, which is about 20 km away. I know a new Naxalbari will rise, and it will rise through the efforts of people like her.\\" Category:Naxalite‚ÄìMaoist insurgency Category:Indian communists Category:Peasant revolts Category:Political uprisings in India Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Shanti Munda"},{"id":"62395373","text":"Payson-Dixon line or Payson-Dixie line is an unofficial political boundary sometimes referred to in Utah politics. It refers to the area south of Payson, Utah, down to St. George, Utah which carries the nickname of Utah's Dixie. It is a pun on the well known Mason-Dixon line, that is an unofficial barrier that delineates where the American south begins.  Use and history  While the term can be used with various connotations, it is usually used in reference to an urban-rural divide that exists in the Utah political sphere. Because 80% of Utah's population lives in the Wasatch Front, people used to acknowledge that rural issues are more relevant in southern Utah. It is also used as a point of pride for those who live south of it, while hardly used by those who live north of it (both uses are similar to the meanings of the Mason-Dixon Line from which it alludes.) The origin of the term is unknown, but an early use appears in 1988 in St. George's newspaper: The Spectrum. It is being used regularly by 1993, with Utah State representative Met Johnson [R-UT-74] using the term in opinion pieces and other settings expressing his concern of the growing divide. The terms use in Utah politics, continues with use throughout the 2000s and became important again in the 2012 US House House of Representatives Election, with the creation of Utah Congressional District 4. With the 2010 census, CD4 was created and then Rep. Jim Matheson, elected to run in that newly created district, rather than the one he was then listed as representing. Rep. Chris Stewart used the term against his opponent, Jay Seegmiller, in the race, saying as he didn't live in the district, he couldn't understand the needs of people south of Payson-Dixon line. It has been used frequently in 2018, and 2019 by Utah Lt. Governor Spencer Cox in keynotes, tweets, podcasts, and other public situations to advocate for Southern Utah. Being from the area himself, he has used it in the context of his current role as Lt. Governor, as well as his 2020 Gubernatorial campaign, in which he has used it throughout his tour of the 248 incorporated cities in Utah, especially those in the rural south.

According to Hamilton Child, the Newark Lime and Cement Manufacturing Company was the most important manufacturing establishment in Rondout, and began operation in spring 1851. The company owned 250 acres including waterfront on the channel of the Rondout Creek. The Rondout Manufactory alone produced 227,516 barrels. The works consisted of twenty-one kilns for burning the stone, two mill buildings, four storehouses, capable of storing upwards of 20,000 barrels, a cooperage establishment, millwrights', wheelwrights', blacksmiths', and carpenters' shops, barns stables. Stone, from which the cement was made, was quarried from the hill immediately in the rear of the factory, and was obtained by tunneling and sinking shafts, from which extend galleries in the stratum of cement rock, which inclines to the north-west. An extensive system of railways transported the stone from the quarries to the top of the kilns, where it was burned by being mixed with culm or fine coal, and then passed by a series of descents through the various stages of manufacture till it arrived in barrels at the wharf ready for shipment. As the cement manufactured often exceeded 1,000 barrels per day, the deficiency in barrels was supplied from the stock accumulated during the season when navigation was closed, and the manufacture of cement necessarily suspended. The number of men employed varied from 250 to 300.Child, Hamilton. \\"Rondout\\", Gazetteer and Business Directory Of Ulster County, N. Y.

It predated Stellar Games' Nightlife (1990) and White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade (1991) by years, and may well have been the first release in the urban-monster genre of RPGs ‚Äî though the general concept of monsters as PCs dated back to at least Metagaming's Monsters!

The crystals form in sub-parallel intergrowths in aggregates up to 5 mm long and are part of the cubic crystal system. The mineral is found in the Packrat mine in Colorado, USA in association with three mineral of similar composition, packratite, Ca11(As3+V4+2V5+10As5+6O51)2„Éª83H2O, morrisonite, Ca6(As3+V4+2V5+10As5+6O51)2„Éª78H2O, and gatewayite, Ca11(As3+V4+3V5+9As5+6O51)„Éª31H2O. Vanarsite has been determined to be part of the vanadate, arsenite, and arsenate groups. Analytical methods were used to determine its chemical composition, physical properties, and structure. Physical and Optical Properties Vanarsite's physical properties show a very dark blue color, grayish blue streak, vitreous luster, and a hardness of 2 on the Mohs hardness scale. It also has transparent diaphaneity, brittle tenacity, curved fracture, and fair cleavage on {100}. Vanarsite has a calculated density of 2.460 g/cm3 and a measured density of 2.48(2) g/cm3. Its optical class is biaxial (-) with an Œ± value of 1.645(5), a Œ≤ value of 1.677(calc), and a Œ≥ value of 1.681(calc). It has a 2V value of 37(2)¬∞ (measured), and its dispersion is not observed. It has orientation where X = b, Y ^ a = 12¬∞ in obtuse Œ≤ and pleochroism where X = cornflower blue, Y = dark blue, Z = dark blue; X << Z ‚âà Y. Occurrence Vanarsite is a relatively rare mineral with only a small quantity of the mineral having been found. It was discovered in the main tunnel of the Packrat mine, Gateway district, Mesa County, Colorado, USA. Packrat mine is located in the northern part of the Uravan Mineral Belt where uranium and vanadium containing minerals often occur together in sandstone from the Salt Wash member of the Jurassic Morrison Formation. Vanarsite was found located with three other minerals that were discovered at the same time in the same locality, packratite, morrisonite, and gatewayite and is also associated with pharmacolite. The mineral forms from the oxidation of montroseite and corvusite minerals in moist environments. Oxidized and unoxidized phases are exposed from mining operations. Ambient temperatures and oxidizing conditions near the surface cause water to react with pyrite and an unknown arsenic bearing phase to form aqueous solutions with low pH. Various secondary vanadate phases form depending on Eh-pH conditions and other cations present. Chemical Analysis Chemical analysis was performed using a Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe at the University of Utah with four wavelength dispersive spectrometers. Analytical conditions include 15keV accelerating voltage, 10 nA beam current, and a beam diameter of 10-15Œºm. In the analysis, vanadium, arsenic, strontium, sodium, and calcium were counted simultaneously with counts occurring 10 seconds for each except Na which was 5 seconds on their respective spectrometers. Standards for the elements were: YVO4 (V), GaAs (As), Sr-titanate (Sr), albite (Na), and diopside (Ca). The constituents analyzed were normalized for a total of 100% weight combined with the calculated H2O. The weight percents for each cation in terms of oxygen are as follows: 0.63 for Na2O, 13.08 for CaO, 0.22 for SrO, 0.04 for FeO, 31.61 for As2O5, and 43.89 for V2O5. Crystallography and Structure Powder and single crystal X-ray analysis were used in the determination of the crystallography and structure of the mineral. A Gandolfi- like motion was used in the powder diffraction method in the œÜ and œâ axes to randomize the samples. The derived d-values and intensities were analyzed using JADE 2010 software. The structure of the mineral was determined with Rigaku CrystalClear software using an empirical multi-scan absorption. The structural unit was determined to be a heteropolyanion consisting of twelve distorted octahedra (V4+,5+O6) around a central pyramid (As3+O3 (arsenite)) and decorated by peripheral tetrahedra (As5+O4 (arsenate)). Each peripheral tetrahedra shares three of its four vertices with octahedra (VO6). The very dark blue color results from a V4+-V5+ charge transfer in the V sites.

It is situated west-northwest of Coquihalla Summit, northwest of Gamuza Peak, and southeast of Ibex Peak, its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Anderson River. The mountain was named for the steinbok, as part of the ungulate names theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of Vancouver. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Steinbok was used to represent Kichatna Spire in the 1991 movie K2. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Steinbok Peak Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Steinbok Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Steinbok Peak.

Publication history Creatures & Cultists, designed by Jeff Barber and John Tynes, with contributions by Dennis Detwiller and Jonathan Tweet, and with card art by J. Todd Kingrea and cover art by Chris Prynoski, originally appeared in the Fall 1991 edition of The Unspeakable Oath (Issue #4). Pagan Press, publishers of The Unspeakable Oath, then released Creatures & Cultists in 1993 as a stand-alone card game. Gameplay Creatures & Cultists is a light-hearted game in which 3‚Äì5 players create cults that then try to summon gods from the Cthulhu mythos to destroy the world. The game comes as an 8.5\\" x 11\\" book with 8 player sheets, 4 pages of rules, and cardstock sheets with 128 playing cards that need to be removed from the game and cut apart. Play also requires several 6-sided dice, which are not supplied. Cult generation and set-up Each player decides on a name, a motto, and a symbol for their cult, and then generates initial scores for three skills: Conjuring, Sorcery and Thuggery. Each player has a player sheet that displays the 24 members of their cult, arranged in three rows of 8. Each player turns their player sheet towards the other players so that the front row of cultists is facing the centre of the table. Each player is then dealt six cards. The round A round consists of one turn by each player. * The first action during each round is to determine which cult is \\"favored by the stars.\\" (That player takes the last turn of the round, but adds +2 to all dice rolls during the player's turn.) * Players then replenish their hands back up to six cards, if necessary. * The player to the right of the \\"favored\\" person plays a turn, and play continues to the right, until the \\"favored\\" person plays last. The turn On each turn, the active player must first play any Mondo cards that are held, drawing from the deck to replace these as they are played. The active player can then do any of the following in any order: * Play Event cards or Sorcery cards (which may affect the player positively or another cult negatively) * Using one of the player's cultists in the front row of their player sheet, play a Thuggery or Conjuring card against any other player's cult member that is currently in the enemy cult's front row. ** The active player may play any number of Thuggery of Conjuring cards each turn, but is limited to only one attack from each surviving cultist in their front row. ** In addition, only one attack can be targeted against any one enemy cult member each turn. ** Each enemy cultist killed earns the active player's cult the number of \\"Fuggly Points\\" listed on the dead cultist's card. *** A certain number of Fuggly Points are required to win the game, but can also be spent to gain bonuses to die rolls, or to achieve desired effects on a few special cards. * The active player can discard any number of cards if desired * If the active player's cult is currently \\"favored by the stars\\" and the cult has earned enough Fuggly Points, the cult can attempt to summon its deity and destroy the world. Combat To make an attack, the active player chooses one of their front-line cultists to make the attack, rolls three 6-sided dice, adds the attacking cultist's bonus, and subtracts the target's defensive modifier. If the total is equal to or higher than the active cult's relevant skill, the attack is successful. An outstanding success (a \\"spooge\\") will result in an extra positive effect, usually to the detriment of the defending player. A critical failure (a \\"boof\\") will result in a bad thing happening against the attacking player. Successfully removing an enemy cultist from play nets the attacking player the dead cultist's Fuggly Points. Winning the game A cult with the requisite number of Fuggly Points and that is currently \\"favored by the stars\\" can attempt to summon its deity to destroy the world. If successful, that player is the winner. Reception In the January 1994 edition of Pyramid (Issue #5 ), Chris W. McCubbin found the game components to be \\"as excellent as you can reasonably expect for a company their size\\", but found that \\"although the basic rules are very clear and readable, they too often break down when it comes to specifics and special cases.\\" Nonetheless McCubbin found the good outweighed the bad, saying \\"Creatures & Cultists is about as good as any game with a list price under $10 can possibly be (or at least it will be once those pesky rules ambiguities are cleared up). It's an entertaining and unpretentious little game, and while it will never be a Hacker, much less a Magic: The Gathering, for groups with the right sense of humor this game could become a long-lasting favorite.\\" In the April 1994 edition of Dragon (Issue #204), Lester W. Smith admitted to being \\"surprised at just how lightheartedly silly it turned out to be, well, lightheartedly silly for a horror product... For players of the Call of Cthulhu game, it is a refreshing change of pace from watching favorite characters slowly go mad while pursuing mind-blastingly horrible creatures from beyond time and space.\\" Overall, Smith found the game to be \\"well designed and a lot of fun to play.\\" He only found fault with one card, which forces one cult to automatically \\"boof\\" its next roll. If played on a cult that is about to try to win the game by summoning its deity, this card results in the deity destroying the cult instead, knocking that player out of the game. Smith advised players to make a house rule that playing the card in such a way results in an ordinary failure, not a \\"boof\\". Other than that, Smith gave the game a rating of 4 out of 6, saying, \\"I‚Äôm quite fond of this game. In my opinion, it is a great value for a modest price.\\" References Category:Card games introduced in 1993 ","title":"Creatures &amp; Cultists"},{"id":"62395616","text":"Maciu≈õ is a Polish-language given name.

At just 21, he was made officer in command of the Irish Republican Army (I.R.A.) Arsenal in Bailieborough, County Cavan, on the recommendation of General Se√°n Mac Eoin. He was the only member of the I.R.A. who could forge cast iron hand grenades which would fragment. During the Irish Civil War, he underwent a hunger strike lasting twenty-three days.Obituary of Christopher P. Burke, Drogheda Independent, 11 July 1964  Early life  Burke was born on 4 August 1898 on Coola Street, Drogheda, County Louth, to Christopher Patrick Burke, secretary of the gas works, and Mary McQuillan. He lived the first eight years of his life on Coola Street, and was raised in a well-off family. However, things took a turn for the worse with the death of Christopher Burke Sr. from Bright's disease on 12 October 1906 at the age of just 44. With the family's source of income gone, his mother moved with him and his five siblings to live with her siblings on Duleek Street.  Revolutionary activities  Christopher Burke joined the Irish Volunteers in 1917, and after two years in its ranks, during which he was promoted to officership, the General Headquarters ordered him to sever, outwardly, his connections with the organisation, which he did. After being released from prison in the Drogheda Foundry, he was the only man in the IRA who could forge cast iron hand grenades which would fragment. Upon his resignation, he was appointed officer in command of the IRA Arsenal in Bailieborough, County Cavan, on the recommendation of General Se√°n Mac Eoin, known as the ‚ÄúBlacksmith of Ballinalee‚Äù. He retained this post under the nom de guerre of ‚ÄúSe√°n Jones‚Äù, sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúSeaghan Mac Seaghan‚Äù, until the end of hostilities against the British. He was captured on one occasion by British forces while en route to Navan by motorcycle, where he was held hostage by them. However, a few days later, an aeroplane piloted by a British officer crash landed close to an Irish Volunteer camp and he was promptly taken prisoner. Both prisoners were released in an exchange between the two forces. It was in Bailiborough, under the command of Christopher Burke, that all of the hand-grenades that the IRA used during the War of Independence were made. By this point, the Black and Tans had arrived in Ireland. This group was made up of many British soldiers who had fought in the First World War and would go on to commit many atrocities against the Irish after becoming desensitised to violence during said war. They would travel in \\"half trucks\\" which consisted of a cab for a driver and an officer, behind which fourteen constables sat back to back in two rows. Members of the IRA would endeavour to throw a grenade into the truck from a nearby roof when it passed. In order to save his fellow soldiers, one of them would have to jump on the hand grenade, sacrificing himself in the process. So, the British decided to put steel frames over the trucks, with netting wire over the frames, so that when grenades were thrown, they bounced off the wire. As well as this, the Black and Tans could shoot out through the wire. This development was reported to Michael Collins, who then forwarded it on to Se√°n Mac Eoin, who then told Christopher Burke that his grenades were \\"bouncing off\\". After being enlightened as to what was going on with the netting wire, Christopher went back to his forge, where he immediately made hand grenades with fishhooks moulded into them. When these grenades were flung at the troop transport trucks of the Black and Tans, they would catch onto the wire above the troops, meaning it was impossible for anyone to lie on them and therefore save the rest. Casualties depended on which part of the truck was hit, and on three separate occasions all fourteen Black and Tans were killed by Christopher Burke's fishhook grenades. Christopher Burke was awarded with the ‚ÄúService Medal with Bar‚Äù for his active military service during the War of Independence, also known as the ‚ÄúBlack and Tan Medal and Bar‚Äù. Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, Christopher Burke's cousin, Eamonn Duggan, one of the Treaty's signatories, offered him a rank in the army or police, however Christopher Burke declined on principal.  Irish Civil War  Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, Christopher Burke's cousin, Eamonn Duggan, one of the Treaty's signatories, offered him a rank in the army or police, however Christopher Burke declined on principal. When the Civil War broke out in 1922, Christopher Burke fought on the Republican side, and was in charge of the boycott of Drogheda on 28 June, wherein Anti-Treaty forces took over the town and blew up the railway bridge south of it, isolating it from Dublin. On 4 July, Free State forces attacked republican- held Drogheda. At this point, Christopher Burke and his subordinates were based in Millmount Fort, which overlooks the town, and also held the railway station. The National Army brought up mortars and 18-pounder guns to shell them, and after several hours of bombardment the Anti-Treaty forces surrendered. There was also fighting at the railway station in town, though the republicans there would surrender soon after. After his capture by the Free State forces, Christopher Burke was imprisoned in Maryborough Gaol in Portlaoise, County Laois, where he went on a hunger strike lasting twenty- three days. As a protest against the conditions in the prison, the inmates set fire to the building and for six months following this incident had to sleep in the open. A while later, Christopher was transferred along with his fellow prisoners to the Curragh Camp, known to its inmates as \\"Tin-town\\", until the general release.  Sporting activities  Like his brothers, Christopher Burke was an \\"extremely successful\\" athlete, and had many trophies as a runner, footballer and hurler with St. Mary's H.C., Con Colbert's F.C., Stars F.C., Wolfe Tone F.C., John Mitchel H.C., and the Louth county team. He also had a keen interest in greyhound racing.  Political activities  In 1934, Christopher Burke was elected to the Corporation of Drogheda as a Fianna F√°il candidate for the Duleek Gate Ward, and was re-elected when the Council was reduced from 24 members to 12.  Later life and death  In 1932, Christopher Burke was brought to court by his older brother Michael Burke after assaulting him in the family home on Duleek Street, Drogheda. The house had been left to Michael in the will of their aunt Jane McQuillan, who died in 1919, leaving the premises to him, but requiring his mother and two sisters, Mary \\"Maise\\" and Christina Mary \\"Tena\\", to be supported there. However, Christopher insisted on living there, along with his brother Joseph, leading to a family dispute. On the day of the assault, there were two young boys in the house listening to a football match on the wireless radio. Michael Burke ordered them to leave, and following this, Christopher came back from milking the cows. He asked Michael why he had send the boys away from the wireless, to which he gave no response, following which Christopher hit his brother six times, badly cutting his eye. Michael was attended by a Dr. McCullen, and his left eye black and swollen, while there was a slight mark on his forehead. The Justice said that the will gave Michael Burke the ownership of the house and the tenants subject to the charges set out in it. He fined Christopher Burke 5 shillings, though Michael Burke's lawyer, Mr. Tallan said he was more concerned with Christopher and Joseph Burke getting a dwelling somewhere else. After this, Christopher Burke went into the dairy business with his brother, Joseph Burke, and built a house on the family farm in Bryanstown, County Meath. He died from coronary occlusion at the age of 65 in his home on 23 June 1964. His sister, Christina Mary \\"Tena\\" Burke was present at his death. Christopher Burke's requiem mass was celebrated at St. Mary's Church in Drogheda by Rev. T. O'Connor, Very Rev. J. Johnston, Rev. P. Adams, Rev. J. Bird and Rev. Fr. Daly. At his funeral to Tullyallen Cemetery, Rev. J. Johnston accompanied the remains and officiated at the graveside. Christopher's republican comrades attended the funeral, and the Mayor of Drogheda and members of the Drogheda Corporation walked wearing their robes of office in the cortege.

History  The SCWO had its roots in the late 1970s, when activists began to feel a need for an umbrella organisation for women's groups in Singapore. Caroline Lam was one of the first women to suggest creating such an organisation in 1978 and in November of that year, a meeting took place to consider different names. The first temporary committee was made up of Lam, Julie Tan, Anaman Tan, Seow Peck Leng, Maureen Tan, and Mary Ho. This group of women created a constitution for the proposed group and sent this to 24 different women's organisations in October of 1979. SCWO was formally founded in 1980 and was a \\"government- sanctioned\\" group. The first president of the group was Julie Tan. By 1999, the group represented 38 different women's organisations and had 94,000 members. In 2019, there were more than 50 groups and more than 500,000 women represented by SCWO.

Her father's job made him transfer locations throughout Hyogo prefecture regularly, so Saegusa moved often. Her mother was a Protestant, and took her children to church with her. Saegusa was an avid reader as a child, and began writing in middle school. In 1944, Saegusa worked at a factory in Nagasaki because of the National Mobilization Law. She returned to Hyogo in April 1945 to attend school. Saegusa studied philosophy at the Kwansei Gakuin University, graduating in 1950. She was a member of a Dostoyevsky study group. She went to graduate school at the same university, focusing her studies on Hegel. She met Koichi Saegusa (his penname was ) while studying at the university. They married in 1951 and moved to Kyoto.  Career  While living in Kyoto they worked as middle school teachers and published literary magazines. Koichi inherited his father's temple in 1962, so they moved to Takino, Hyogo and lived in the temple. They both stopped teaching, and Saegusa became a writer full-time. Koichi started a journal in 1964, and Saegusa published much of her writing there during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her book S≈çs≈ç no asa (Ëë¨ÈÄÅ„ÅÆÊúù) was an honorable mention for the Bungei Prize in 1963. In 1969 she won the Tamura Toshiko Prize for her short story, \\"Shokei ga okonawareteiru\\".

She also frequently visited Greece. She died on April 24, 2003.  Style  Saegusa's style is dark, with unreliable narrators who hallucinate and are obsessed with fate and death. Frequent themes include Japan's defeat in World War II, men's view of womanhood, and the collapse of social institutions like villages and families. Her studies of Greek and Roman literature and mythology have also had a clear influence on her writing. Some of her books, like Sono hi no natsu, show a female perspective of war and its aftermath in contrast to typical war novels that have male protagonists.

In particular, critics have highlighted the concentration of Uyghurs in state-sponsored re- education camps, suppression of Uyghur religious practices and testimonials of alleged human rights abuses including forced sterilization and contraception. Chinese authorities confirmed that birth rates dropped by almost a third in 2018 in Xinjiang, but denied reports of forced sterilization and genocide. The allegations have not received formal United Nations (UN) recognition, with 54 member states supporting China's policies in Xinjiang, and 23 condemning them. In July and August 2020, human rights activist groups have called on the International Criminal Court and United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate Chinese officials for allegations of crimes against humanity and genocide. Definition Labeling as an ethnocide or cultural genocide Since the release of the Xinjiang papers and the China Cables in November 2019, various journalists and researchers have called the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs an ethnocide or a cultural genocide. In November 2019, Adrian Zenz described the classified documents as confirming \\"that this is a form of cultural genocide\\". Azeem Ibrahim of Foreign Policy called the Chinese treatment of Uyghurs a \\"deliberate and calculated campaign of cultural genocide\\" in December 2019 after the release of the Xinjiang papers and China Cables. James Liebold, a professor at the Australian La Trobe University, has called the treatment of Uyghurs by the Chinese government a \\"cultural genocide\\" and stated that \\"in their own words, party officials are 'washing brains' and 'cleansing hearts' in order to 'cure' those bewitched by extremist thoughts.\\" Labeling as crimes against humanity and a genocide In July 2020, The Globe and Mail reported that human rights activists, including retired politician Irwin Cotler, were pressuring the Parliament of Canada to recognize the Chinese actions against Uyghurs as a genocide. In the same month, Adrian Zenz said an interview with NPR that he had previously argued that the actions of the Chinese government are a cultural genocide but not a \\"literal genocide\\", but that recent developments concerning the suppression of birth rates meant that it one of the five criteria from the Genocide Convention were met so \\"we do need to probably call it a genocide\\". In July 2020, two Uyghur activist groups filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court calling for it to investigate PRC officials for crimes against Uyghurs including allegations of genocide. An August 2020 Quartz article reported that some scholars hesitate to label the human rights abuses in Xinjiang as a \\"full-blown genocide\\", preferring the term \\"cultural genocide\\", but that increasingly many experts were calling them \\"crimes against humanity\\" or \\"genocide\\". In September 2020, nearly two dozen activist groups, including the Uyghur Human Rights Project, Genocide Watch, and the European Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, signed an open letter for the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to investigate whether crimes against humanity or a genocide were taking place in Xinjiang. As of July 2020, Amnesty International has not taken a position on whether the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs constituted an genocide.  Background   Xinjiang conflict  Various Chinese dynasties have historically exerted control over parts of modern-day Xinjiang. The region came under modern Chinese rule as a result of the westward expansion of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, which also saw the conquests of Tibet and Mongolia. After the 1928 assassination of Yang Zengxin, the governor of the semi-autonomous Kumul Khanate in east Xinjiang under the Republic of China, Jin Shuren, succeeded Yang as the governor of the Khanate. On the death of the Kamul Khan Maqsud Shah in 1930, Jin entirely abolished the Khanate and took control of the region as warlord. In 1933, the breakaway First East Turkestan Republic was established in the Kumul Rebellion. In 1934, the First Turkestan Republic was conquered by warlord Sheng Shicai with the aid of the Soviet Union before Sheng reconciled with the Republic of China in 1942. In 1944, the Ili Rebellion led to the Second East Turkestan Republic with dependency on the Soviet Union for trade, arms, and \\"tacit consent\\" for its continued existence before being absorbed into the People's Republic of China in 1949. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Chinese government sponsored a mass migration of Han Chinese to the region and introduced a number of policies to suppress the cultural identity and religion of Uyghurs. During this time, several Uyghur separatist organizations with potential support from the Soviet Union emerged, with the East Turkestan People's Party being the largest in 1968. During the 1970s, the Soviets supported the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) to fight the Chinese. In 1997, a police roundup and execution of 30 suspected separatists during Ramadan led to large demonstrations in February 1997 that resulted in the Ghulja incident, a People's Liberation Army (PLA) crackdown that led to at least nine deaths. The √úr√ºmqi bus bombings later that month killed nine people and injured 68 with responsibility acknowledged by Uyghur exile groups. In March 1997, a bus bomb killed two people with responsibility claimed by Uyghur separatists and the Turkey-based Organisation for East Turkistan Freedom. In July 2009, riots broke out in Xinjiang in response to a violent dispute between Uyghur and Han Chinese workers in a factory that resulted in over one hundred deaths. Following the riots, Uyghur terrorists killed dozens of Han Chinese in coordinated attacks from 2009 to 2016. These included the August 2009 syringe attacks, the 2011 bomb-and-knife attack in Hotan, the March 2014 knife attack in the Kunming railway station, the April 2014 bomb-and-knife attack in the √úr√ºmqi railway station, and the May 2014 car-and-bomb attack in an √úr√ºmqi street market. The attacks were conducted by Uyghur separatists, with some orchestrated by the UN-designated terrorist organization Turkistan Islamic Party (formerly the East Turkistan Islamic Movement). Abroad, Uyghur terrorists bombed the Chinese embassy in Kyrgyzstan in 2016; in 2014, they killed 25 people in an attack on a Thai shrine popular with Chinese tourists. During the peak of Syria's civil war (2011- 2017), thousands of Uyghurs from China went to Syria and joined ISIS and Al Qaeda. The Uyghur fighters wanted to learn combat skills and return to China. About 50,000 Uyghurs also moved to Turkey, mostly in towns close to the border with Syria. Government policies Xinjiang Police Jobs as they grow with Internment Camps Number of re-education related government procurement bids in Xinjiang Initial \\"Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism\\" In April 2010, after the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, Zhang Chunxian replaced the former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) secretary Wang Lequan, who had been behind religious policies in Xinjiang for 14 years. In May 2014, China launched the \\"Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism\\" in Xinjiang in response to growing tensions between Han Chinese and the Uyghur population of Xinjiang itself. In announcing the campaign, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping stated that \\"practice has proved that our party's ruling strategy in Xinjiang is correct and must be maintained in the long run\\" in May 2014. Regulations since 2017 New bans and regulations were implemented on April 1, 2017. Abnormally long beards and wearing veils in public were both banned. Not watching state-run television or listening to radio broadcasts, refusing to abide by family planning policies, or refusing to allow one's children to attend state run schools were all prohibited. Giving a child a name that would \\"exaggerate religious fervor,\\" such as Muhammad, was made illegal. Along with this, many mosques were demolished or destroyed. Re-education efforts began in 2014 and were expanded in 2017. At this time, detainment camps were built for the housing of students of the re-education programs, most of whom are Uyghurs. The Chinese government did not acknowledge their existence until 2018 and called them \\"vocational education and training centers.\\" This name was changed to \\"vocational training centers\\" in 2019. The camps tripled in size from 2018 to 2019 despite the Chinese government claiming that most of the detainees had been released. Using Google Earth, satellite images show the appearance of the camps. \\"Shadows reveal watchtowers and razor-wire atop the wall [...] these are places the government doesn‚Äôt want people to escape from.\\" Counter-terrorism justification China has used the global \\"war on terror\\" of the 2000s to frame separatist and ethnic unrest as acts of Islamist terrorism to legitimize its counter-insurgency policies in Xinjiang. In August 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination decried the \\"broad definition of terrorism and vague references to extremism\\" used by Chinese legislation, noting that there were numerous reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities on the \\"pretext of countering terrorism\\". In 2019, the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, Sam Brownback, and Nathan Sales said that the Chinese government consistently misuses \\"counterterrorism\\" as a pretext for cultural suppression and human rights abuses.  Cultural effects   Mosques  Tuyoq, Xinjiang There are about 24,400 mosques in Xinjiang, an average of one mosque for every 530 Muslims. In 2005, Human Rights Watch reported that \\"information scattered in official sources suggests that retaliation\\" against mosques not sponsored by the Chinese State was prevalent, and that the Xinjiang Party Secretary expressed that Uyghurs \\"should not have to build new places for religious activities.\\" The Chinese government prohibited minors from participating in religious activities in Xinjiang in a manner that, according to Human Rights Watch, \\"has no basis in Chinese law.\\" According to an analysis from The Guardian, over one-third of mosques and religious sites in China suffered ‚Äúsignificant structural damage‚Äù between 2016 and 2018, with nearly one-sixth of all mosques and shrines completely razed. This includes the tomb of Imam Asim, a mud tomb in the Taklamakan desert and the Ordam shrine at the mazar of Ali Arslan Khan. According to The Guardian, Uyghur Muslims believe that repeated pilgrimages to these tomb would fulfill a Muslim's obligation to complete the Hajj.  Allegations about Id Kah Mosque  Id Kah Mosque is the largest mosque in Xinjiang and the largest in China.Peter Neville-Hadley. Frommer's China. Frommer's, 2003. . Page 302. Radio Free Asia reported that in 2018, a plaque containing Quranic scriptures, that had long hung outside the front entrance of the mosque, had been removed by the authorities in order to \\"eliminate Uyghur faith, literary works, and language\\". However, in July 2020, the Chinese embassy in the US tweeted a video interview with the imam showing the plaque hanging inside the mosque, claiming that the mosque had been renovated. The imam stated that the plaque had been moved inside to protect it from exposure to the rain and sun.  Education  In 2011, schools in Xinjiang transitioned to \\"bilingual education.\\" The majority of the instruction occurs in Mandarin Chinese, with only a few hours a week devoted to Uyghur literature. Despite this emphasis on \\"bilingual education,\\" few Han children are taught to speak Uyghur. Uyghur students are also increasingly being sent to residential schools far from their home communities where they are able to speak Uyghur. According to a 2020 report from Radio Free Asia, monolingual Mandarin Chinese education has been introduced in an influential high school in Kashgar which formerly provided bilingual education. Former teacher at the camps, Sayragul Sauytba, is an ethnic Kazakh woman who was forced to teach at a re-education camp before she escaped the country. She \\"described the camps as cramped and unhygienic, with detainees given only meager meals. Authorities force the detainees to learn Chinese, sit through indoctrination classes, and make public confessions. [...] torture and rape were common and that authorities forced detainees to take a medicine that made some sterile or cognitively impaired.\\"  Detained academics and religious figures  The Uyghur Human Rights Project has identified at least 386 Uyghur intellectuals that were detained and have disappeared since early 2017 as victims of the massive campaign of ethno-religious repression carried out by the Chinese government in the Uyghur homeland. Uyghur economist Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life in prison in 2014. Amnesty International called his sentence unjustified and deplorable. Rahile Dawut, a prominent Uyghur anthropologist who studied and preserved Islamic shrines, traditional songs and folklore, has also been imprisoned. According to Radio Free Asia, the Chinese government jailed Uyghur Imam Abduheber Ahmet after he took his son to a religious school not sanctioned by the Chinese state. Ahmet had previously been lauded by China as a \\"five-star\\" imam, but was sentenced in 2018 to over five years in prison for his action. Graveyards In September 2019, Agence France-Presse (AFP) visited 13 destroyed cemeteries across four cities and witnessed exposed bones still remaining in 4 of them. Through examination of satellite images, the press agency determined that the grave destruction campaign had been active for more than a decade. According to a previous AFP report, three cemeteries in Xayar County were among dozens of Uyghur cemeteries destroyed in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019. The unearthed human bones from the cemeteries in Xayar County were discarded. In January 2020, a CNN report based on analysis of Google Maps satellite imagery said that Chinese authorities have destroyed more than 100 graveyards in Xinjiang, primarily Uyghur ones. CNN has linked the destruction of the cemeteries to the governments campaign to control the Uyghurs and Muslims more broadly. The Chinese government terms the cemetery and tomb destruction as \\"relocations\\" and claim that the dead are re-interred in new standardized cemeteries. Among the destroyed cemeteries is Sultanim Cemetery (), the central Uyghur historical graveyard with generations of burials and the most sacred shrine in Hotan city, which was demolished and converted into a parking lot between 2018 and 2019. CGTN, a Chinese state- owned international channel affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, claimed that the graves were relocated.  Marriage incentives  Uyghur Woman in Xinjiang According to gender studies expert Leta Hong Fincher, the Chinese government has offered Uyghur couples incentives to have fewer children, and for women to marry outside of their race. According to the outreach coordinator for the U.S.-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, Zubayra Shamseden, the Chinese government \\"wants to erase Uighur culture and identity by remaking its women.\\" Marriages between Uyghurs and Han Chinese persons are encouraged with subsidies by the government. In August 2014, local authorities in Cherchen County (Qiemo County) announced, ‚ÄúIncentive Measures Encouraging Uighur-Chinese Intermarriage,‚Äù including a 10,000 CNY (US$1,450) cash reward per annum for the first five years to such intermarried couples as well as preferential treatment in employment and housing plus free education for the couples, their parents and offspring. County CCP Secretary Zhu Xin remarked: In October 2017, the marriage of a Han Chinese man from Henan Province to a Uyghur woman from Lop County was celebrated on the county's social media page: Darren Byler, an anthropologist and China expert at the University of Washington, said that a social media campaign in 2020 to marry off 100 Uyghur women to Han Chinese men indicated that, \\"a certain racialized power dynamic is a part of this process,\\" commenting, ‚ÄúIt does seem as though this is an effort to produce greater assimilation and diminish ethnic difference by pulling Uighurs into Han-dominated relationships.‚Äù In March 2017, Salamet Memetimin, an ethnic Uyghur and the Communist Party Secretary for Chaka township's Bekchan village in Qira County, Hotan Prefecture, was relieved of her duties for taking her nikah marriage vows at her home. In interviews with Radio Free Asia in 2020, residents and officials of Shufu County (Kona Sheher), Kashgar Prefecture (Kashi) stated that it was no longer possible to perform traditional Uyghur nikah marriage rites in the county.  Clothing  Chinese authorities discourage the wearing of headscarves, veils, and other Islamic dress in the region. On May 20, 2014, a protest broke out in Alakaga (Alaqagha, Alahage), Kuqa (Kuchar, Kuche), Aksu Prefecture when 25 women and schoolgirls were detained for wearing headscarves. According to a local official, two died and five were injured when special armed police fired into the protesters. Subsequently, a Washington Post team was detained in Alakaga and ultimately deported from the region.  Children's names  According to Radio Free Asia, in 2015, a list of banned names for children called \\"Naming Rules For Ethnic Minorities\\", was promulgated in Hotan, banning potential names including Islam, Quran, Mecca, Jihad, Imam, Saddam, Hajj, and Medina. Use of the list was later extended throughout Xinjiang.  Allegations of human rights abuses   Inside internment camps   Torture  Human Rights Watch, a New York-based nonprofit organisation, has alleged \\"'rampant abuses,' including torture and unfair trials\\" of the Uyghurs. Mihrigul Tursun, a young Uyghur mother, said that she was \\"tortured and subjected to other brutal conditions... \\" She was drugged, interrogated for days without sleep, and strapped in a chair and jolted with electricity. It was her third time being sent to a camp since 2015. Tursun told reporters that she remembers interrogators telling her: \\"Being a Uighur is a crime.\\" Another past detainee, Kayrat Samarkand, said that \\"'They made me wear what they called 'iron clothes,' a suit made of metal that weighed over 50 pounds... It forced my arms and legs into an outstretched position. I couldn't move at all, and my back was in terrible pain...They made people wear this thing to break their spirits. After 12 hours, I became so soft, quiet and lawful.'\\"  Compulsory sterilizations and contraception  Zumrat Dwut, a Uyghur woman, claimed that she was forcibly sterilized during her time in a camp before her husband was able to get her out through requests to Pakistani diplomats. While Dwut does not specify how she was sterilized, other women recount having forcefully received contraceptive implants. The Heritage Foundation reported that officials forced Uyghur women to take unknown drugs and drink some kind of white liquid that caused them to lose consciousness and sometimes caused them to stop menstruating. In 2018, a policy of voluntary mass sterilization of the farming population in Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture was promoted. In 2019, birth rates in Kizilsu Prefecture declined. The prefecture received 1.33 million RMB for birth prevention measures and free surgeries. In 2020, the population growth rate of Kizilsu Prefecture was planned to be significantly reduced.  Brainwashing  Kayrat Samarkand described his camp routine in an article for NPR: \\"In addition to living in cramped quarters, he says inmates had to sing songs praising Chinese leader Xi Jinping before being allowed to eat. He says detainees were forced to memorize a list of what he calls '126 lies' about religion: 'Religion is opium, religion is bad, you must believe in no religion, you must believe in the Communist Party,' he remembers. 'Only [the] Communist Party could lead you to the bright future.'\\" Documents which were leaked to The New York Times by an anonymous Chinese official advised that \\"Should students ask whether their missing parents had committed a crime, they are to be told no, it is just that their thinking has been infected by unhealthy thoughts. Freedom is only possible when this 'virus' in their thinking is eradicated and they are in good health.\\" The Heritage Foundation reported that \\"children whose parents are detained in the camps are often sent to state-run orphanages and brainwashed to forget their ethnic roots. Even if their parents are not detained, Uyghur children need to move to inner China and immerse themselves into Han culture under the Chinese government's 'Xinjiang classrooms' policy.\\"  Labor  According to Quartz, the Xinjiang region is described as a \\"'cotton gulag' where prison labor is present in all steps of the cotton supply chain...\\" Tahir Hamut, a Uyghur Muslim, worked in a labor camp during elementary school when he was a child, and he later worked in a re-education camp as an adult, performing such tasks as picking cotton, shoveling gravel, and making bricks. \\"Everyone is forced to do all types of hard labor or face punishment,\\" he said. \\"Anyone unable to complete their duties will be beaten.\\"  Outside internment camps   IUDs and birth control  According to researcher Adrian Zenz, 80% of all new IUD placements in China in 2018 were performed in Xinjiang, despite the region only constituting 1.8% of China's population.; China's National Health Commission has stated that the figure is 8.7%. Across Xinjiang region, in 2019, birth rates have fallen 24%, compared to 4.2% decline in entire China. The Xinjiang government has confirmed this in a fax to the CNN, in which it nevertheless strongly denied allegations of genocide, pointing to an increase in Uyghur population between 2010 and 2017. According to Zenz, natural population growth rates in Xinjiang fell by 84% in the two largest Uyghur prefectures between 2015 and 2018. The local Xinjiang authority has stated that the decline is due to \\"the comprehensive implementation of the family planning policy.\\" The Chinese authorities do not dispute the increase in sterilizations in the region.  Forced cohabitation and abortion In 2018, Chinese public servants began mandatory home stays with Uyghur families for assimilation aid. A 37-year-old pregnant woman from the Xinjiang region said that she attempted to give up her Chinese citizenship in order to live in Kazakhstan but was told by the Chinese government that she needed to come back to China in order to complete the process. She received an abortion that she alleged was required to prevent her brother from being detained. A book by Guo Rongxing on the unrest in Xinjiang states that the 1990 Baren Township riot protests were the result of 250 forced abortions imposed upon local Uyghur women by the Chinese government. Organ harvesting Ethan Gutmann, a fellow at the conservative think-tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies and China watcher, concluded that organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience became prevalent when members of the Uyghur ethnic group were targeted in security crackdowns and \\"strike hard campaigns\\" during the 1990s. According to Gutmann, organ harvesting from Uyghur prisoners dropped off by 1999 with members of the Falun Gong religious group overtaking the Uyghurs as a source or organs.Ethan Gutmann, ‚ÄúThe Xinjiang Procedure‚Äù , The Weekly Standard, 5 December 2011.David Brooks, ‚ÄúThe Sidney Awards Part II‚Äù , New York Times, 22 December 2011. In the 2010s, concerns about organ harvesting from Uyghurs resurfaced. According to a unanimous determination by the China Tribunal, China has persecuted and medically tested Uyghurs. Its report expressed concerns that Uyghurs were vulnerable to being subject to organ harvesting but did not yet have evidence of its occurrence.  Use of biometric and surveillance technology  Chinese authorities have been utilizing biometric technology to track individuals in the Uyghur community. According to Yahir Imin, a 38-year-old Uyghur, Chinese authorities in Xinjiang drew blood, scanned his face, recorded his fingerprints, and documented his voice. As stated in the article written by Sui-Lee Wee, a key piece in China's strategy is to collect genetic material from millions of people in the Xinjiang region. The genetic material contributes to an extensive database that can track Uyghur individuals who defy the campaign. China has been exploring the use of facial recognition technology to sort people by ethnicity, and how to use DNA to tell if an individual is a Uyghur. According to an assistant professor at the University of Windsor in Ontario, Mark Munsterhjelm, The PRC is creating \\"technologies used for hunting people.\\" In 2017, security-related construction tripled in Xinjiang. According to Charles Rollet, ‚Äúthe projects [in China] include not only security cameras but also video analytics hubs, intelligent monitoring systems, big data centers, police checkpoints, and even drones.\\" The Ministry of Public Security has invested billions of dollars into two main government plans: the Skynet project (Â§©ÁΩëÂ∑•Á®ã) and the Sharp Eyes project (Èõ™‰∫ÆÂ∑•Á®ã). These two projects combined are reaching to oversee China's population by the year 2020 through video camera facial recognition. According to Morgan Stanley, by 2020, there will be installments of 400 million security cameras. Various Chinese start-ups have been building algorithms to allow the Chinese government to track the Muslim minority group. These start-ups include SenseTime, CloudWalk, Yitu, Megvii, and Hikvision.  Biometric data  Officials in Tumxuk have gathered hundreds of blood samples from Uyghur individuals, contributing to the campaign in mass-collecting DNA. Tumxuk was named a \\"major battlefield for Xinjiang's security work\\" by the state news media. In January 2018, a forensic DNA lab overseen by the Institute of Forensic Science of China was built in Tumxuk. Documents from within the lab showed that the lab was supported by software created by Thermo Fisher Scientific, a Massachusetts company. This software was used in correspondence to create genetic sequencers, helpful in analyzing DNA. In response, Thermo Fisher declared in February that it would discontinue selling to the Xinjiang region as a result of \\"fact-specific assessments.\\"  GPS tracking on cars  Security officials have ordered residents in China's Northwest region to install GPS tracking devices in their vehicles so authorities can track their movements. This measure affects residents in the Xinjiang region and authorities have claimed that it \\"is necessary in order to counteract the activities of Islamist extremists and separatists\\". An announcement from officials in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture proclaimed that \\"there is a severe threat from international terrorism, and cars have been used as a key means of transport for terrorists as well as constantly serving as weapons. It is therefore necessary to monitor and track all vehicles in the prefecture.\\" Installation of China-made Beidou satellite navigation systems in all private, secondhand, and government vehicles was made necessary from 20 February 2020.  International responses   Reactions at the United Nations  In July 2019, 22 countries issued a joint letter to the 41st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), condemning China's mass detention of Uyghurs and other minorities, calling upon China to \\"refrain from the arbitrary detention and restrictions on freedom of movement of Uyghurs, and other Muslim and minority communities in Xinjiang\\". In the same session, 50 countries issued a joint letter supporting China's Xinjiang policies, criticizing the practice of \\"politicizing human rights issues\\". The letter stated, \\"China has invited a number of diplomats, international organizations officials and journalist to Xinjiang\\" and that \\"what they saw and heard in Xinjiang completely contradicted what was reported in the media.\\" In October 2019, 23 countries issued a joint statement to the UN urging China to \\"uphold its national and international obligations and commitments to respect human rights\\". In response, 54 countries (including China itself) issued a joint statement supporting China's Xinjiang policies. The statement \\"spoke positively of the results of counter-terrorism and de- radicalization measures in Xinjiang and noted that these measures have effectively safeguarded the basic human rights of people of all ethnic groups.\\" In February 2020, the UN demanded unobstructed access in advance of a proposed fact-finding visit to the region. Reactions by country/region  Africa  Several African countries, including Algeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Nigeria, and Somalia, signed a July 2019 letter that publicly praised China's human rights record and dismissed reported abuses in Xinjiang.  East Turkistan Government-in-Exile  In January 2020, President Ghulam Osman Yaghma of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile wrote that, \\"the world is silently witnessing another Holocaust like genocide in East Turkistan....as the President of East Turkistan Government-in-Exile, on behalf of East Turkistan and its people, we again call on the international community including world governments to acknowledge and recognize China's brutal Holocaust like oppression of East Turkistan's people as a genocide.\\"  Europe  In addition to signing a joint statement regarding ethical violations affecting the Uyghur community in Xinjiang, countries such as Germany and Norway have taken further steps to express their opinions on this issue. Germany has specifically called on China to provide UN human rights access to the camps. In addition, Norway has formed an anti-internment camp awareness group.  United Kingdom  On 10 October 2020, Britain‚Äôs shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy suggested that Britain must oppose giving China a seat on the UN‚Äôs human rights body in protest against its abuse of Uyghur Muslims. She added that the UN must be allowed to conduct an inquiry into possible crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.  India  In a 2020 article in The Kashmir Magazine, Kashimiri leader Hashim Qureshi pointed out that Uyghurs are forcibly put in concentration camps in Xinjiang, adding, ‚ÄúMuslim officials are not allowed to grow beards or offer prayers. Mosques cannot raise tall minarets.\\"  Middle East  Many countries in the Middle East signed a UN document defending China's human rights record. A spokesperson for the Turkish Foreign Ministry criticized the camps, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later defended China during his visit there. President Erdogan has attempted to turn east in search for allies while seeking membership in Chinese led Shanghai Cooperation Organization and is unlikely to cause disputes to interfere.Iraq and Iran have also remained silent and have signed the document while Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey have been accused of deporting Uyghurs to China. The United Arab Emirates has formally defended China's human rights records. These countries have appreciated China's respect for the principle of noninterference in other countries' affairs and have therefore placed significance on their economic and political relations. Qatar supported China's policies in Xinjiang until August 21, 2019; Qatar was the first Middle Eastern country to withdraw their defense of the Xinjiang Camps.  New Zealand  The prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, visited Beijing after Christchurch mosque shootings and discussed Xinjiang privately with Xi Jinping. Nothing resulted from such conversations and Ardern did not pursue this topic further. The New York Times thought that the seeming lack of concern was because New Zealand exports many products to China, including milk, meat, and wine.  Pakistan  Pakistan has signed a UN document supporting China's action in Xinjiang.  Russia  Russia has expressed support of China's treatment of Uyghurs on multiple occasions. It signed both statements at the UN (in July and October 2019) that supported China's Xinjiang policies.  Southeast Asia  Cambodia, Myanmar, and The Philippines signed formal support of China's policies. Thailand, Malaysia, and Cambodia have all deported Uyghur people on China's request. In December 2009, the Uyghur American Association expressed concern at the return of 20 Uyghur refugees from Cambodia to China.  United States  The United States Congress passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in reaction to the re-education camps. A senior US diplomat called upon other countries to join the United States denunciations against the Chinese government's policies in Xinjiang. The Uyghur American Association has claimed that Beijing's military approach to terrorism in Xinjiang is state terrorism. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has issued statements about the conditions in Xinjiang writing in part:  Official visits to the camps  China has invited more than 1,000 diplomats, officials of international organizations, journalists and religious personages to visit Xinjiang. Many diplomats, officials, and journalists from various countries have already visited the region. UN counter-terrorism chief Vladimir Voronkov visited Xinjiang in 2019 and found nothing incriminating at the camps. The visit prompted anger from the U.S. State Department. In July 2019, a joint letter signed by 50 nations at the United Nations Human Rights Council talked about official visits to China's Xinjiang region: > \\"China has invited a number of diplomats, international organizations > officials and journalist to Xinjiang to witness the progress of the human > rights cause and the outcomes of counter-terrorism and deradicalization > there. What they saw and heard in Xinjiang completely contradicted what was > reported in the media.\\" The U.S. has called these visits \\"highly choreographed\\" and characterized them as having \\"propagated false narratives.\\" 2022 Winter Olympics Boycott Xinjiang boycott advert on NYU's campus in New York, NY \\"Boycott Xinjiang Genocide Products! Also don't attack our Chinese neighbors. Just say no to xenophobia and racism!\\" In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers and the Uyghur genocide, calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. In a July 30, 2020 letter, the World Uyghur Congress urged the International Olympic Committee to reconsider the decision to hold the Olympics in Beijing.

Involving citizens The usual way of involving citizens in the EU is that of opinion surveys, citizens' consultations, talks (dialogues, debates) and, since 2012, accepting petitions with proposals. Since 1978 the EU considers opinions of citizens through the Eurobarometer surveys, like the 2018 one on the Future of Europe / Future of Europe (including \\"Climate change\\").European Commission > ... > Public Opinion > Eurobarometer Interactive > Future of Europe (including \\"Climate change\\"), October‚ÄìNovember 2018, ec.europa.eu Under the Barroso Commission (2004‚Äì2014) debates with citizens took place, with fifty-one Citizens' Dialogues in EU countries.

Position of the European Parliament Working Group On 16 October 2019, the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament decided to set up a Working Group on the Conference on the Future of Europe. The Working Group is composed of one representative per political group in the European Parliament and one representative from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO),Conference of Presidents.

In November 2019, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) began their debate on how to shape the structure and scope of the Conference. How to involve citizens, representatives of civil society and national parliaments. How to foster a bottom-up approach, rather than a top- down one. On the involvement of citizens, some have underlined that the criteria for selection would be important in ensuring inclusive participation in respect of diversity and gender balance. On the possible topics of the Conference, the AFCO committee discussed the issue of the legislative initiative of Parliament, Council as a second chamber, the rule of law, qualified majority voting in Council, Spitzenkandidaten, transnational lists, economic governance, social policies, the transparency register, and an independent ethics body. On 9 December 2019, the AFCO committee submitted an opinion on the structure, working methods, and topics of the Conference.

From 2020 to 2022, debates will begin first on the democratic functioning of the EU and then on all other controversial topics. An adaptation of the treaties as a consequence of this is explicitly not excluded. Many member states do not like to hear that. Treaty changes are complicated.

It is situated west-northwest of Coquihalla Summit, and northwest of Steinbok Peak. Its nearest higher peak is Alpaca Peak, to the east. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Anderson River. The mountain was named for the ibex, as part of the ungulate theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of Vancouver. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Ibex Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Ibex Peak.

It was serialized in monthly manga magazine Magazine Be √ó Boy since 2006. The chapters were later released in 9 bound volume by Libre under the Be √ó Boy Comics imprint. Nekota had originally published Don't Be Cruel in 2006 as a short story, which became the title work of an anthology that was published with several other unrelated short stories. Following the release of the book, Nekota then self-published several short sequels as d≈çjinshi, which were sold exclusively at Comiket. Afterwards, she published Don't Be Cruel: Plus+ in the March 2010 issue of B-Boy Cube and later decided to continue the main story. The first volume was reprinted with a new cover illustration in 2016. The d≈çjinshi were compiled and published in the volume version of Don't Be Cruel: Plus+. Throughout the series' run, Frontier Works published a series of audio drama CDs. The first drama CD was released on October 22, 2008 and charted #219 on the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart. The second drama CD was released on December 24, 2014 and charted #154 on the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart. The third drama CD was released on November 28, 2018, with a special track included in the first press limited edition. The fourth drama CD was released on December 21, 2018. In 2016, Viz Media licensed the series for North American distribution in English under their SuBLime imprint with the title Don't Be Cruel. The first four volumes were published as two 2-in-1 omnibus. Side stories D≈çjinshi Under the pseudonym \\"Komeya\\", Nekota has also self-published unofficial d≈çjinshi of the series and sold limited copies exclusively at Comiket. The Don't Be Gentle short stories were later compiled and officially released in Don't Be Cruel: Plus+. Reception By August 2018, the series had sold a cumulative total of 1.4 million physical copies in Japan. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised the story and artwork, but noted that the first two volumes bundled in the English omnibus were different in tone, with the first volume opening with non-consensual tropes while the second focusing on more emotional romance. Silverman also reviewed the story and artwork in Akira Takanashi's Story favorably, but felt uncomfortable with Jutta's non-consensual parts.

Jews from Sulzburg and neighbouring locations were buried there until a collective Jewish cemetery was opened in L√∂rrach in 1670. During several decades, no grave was added and the cemetery fell into ruin. In 1717, the cemetery recovered its initial role. The small room was built at this time. The cemetery has 462 graves, the oldest datable one being from 1737. Evidence of desecration can be seen in the modern part of the cemetery.

The team first appears in Strikeforce #1 (September 2019) and was created by writer Tini Howard and artist Germ√°n Peralta.Strikeforce #1 Publication history Marvel Comics announced the series in June 2019: \\"Doing the dirty jobs the Avengers and other Marvel heroes can‚Äôt do! Angela, Blade, Spider-Woman, Wiccan, the Winter Soldier, Monica Rambeau, and Daimon Hellstrom join forces for a monsterrific bloodbath from the dark mind of rising star Tini Howard. Prepare for a tale from the underside of the Marvel Universe in STRIKEFORCE!\\" The series was cancelled in July 2020, making issue #9 (released August 5, 2020) the series finale. Plot summary The Avengers are called to a secret medical facility after receiving reports that someone is trying to release dangerous biological weapons into the atmosphere to infect the population. She-Hulk is driven mad when she comes in contact with the air inside the facility and destroys a wall in a fit of rage, finding Angela, Spectrum, Spider-Woman, Wiccan and Winter Soldier hiding there with no memory of how they came to be there. The Avengers take them into custody and Black Panther calls in Blade to try and make sense of what has happened since neither he or Iron Man can detect any sort of mind control or Skrull energy signatures that would explain what has happened to them. Blade helps the group escape from custody and tells them that, when he was hunting vampires recently, he came across a shapeshifter who had taken the appearance of a young girl but had kept the girl alive and imprisoned and suggests that a similar thing has happened to them. Angela quickly confirms that the shapeshifters are Asgardian in nature and must have landed on Earth after Freyja destroyed their home. Wiccan is reluctant to participate in a mission without the Avengers' knowledge and Spider-Woman in eager to get home to her son but Angela informs them that these shapeshifters become more powerful when more people know of their existence, meaning they must act alone. The team are attacked by a shapeshifter posing as Doctor Doom, with Wiccan theorising that they must have captured Doom and are keeping him somewhere Blade tracks some of the shapeshifters to one of their bases and but the team are quickly overwhelmed. When Daimon Hellstrom attacks, Blade kills him, believing him to be a shapeshifter but, when Satana calls moments later and tells him her brother has just arrived in Las Vegas and is acting strangely, Blade realises he has accidentally killed the real Hellstrom.Strikeforce #1' The team arrive at Satana's club in Vegas and she takes them to her \\"brother\\" who she has kept in magical stasis since his arrival. The team force Satana to leave so that she does not find out about the shapeshifters and task Wiccan with destroying the fake Daimon. Wiccan summons the corpse of the real Daimon but warns the team that his powers do not extend to resurrection. Blade, Spider-Woman, Spectrum and Winter Soldier search the club for other shapeshifters while Angela stays guard over Wiccan in case anything goes wrong. Satana returns and seduces Angela just as Wiccan destroys the fake Hellstrom. The rest of the team find Satana trapped on a stairwell and return to her office, killing the shapeshifter that had been posing as her. A group of smaller shapeshifters attack the team and, in retribution for them taking Daimon, they capture Wiccan.Strikeforce #2 Angela, and Daimon, who was resurrected by his sister, arrive at Wiccan's house and tie up Hulkling, telling him it is too risky for him to know what is going on as Blade fights the shapeshifter posing as Wiccan. Once he is dead, Hulking announces that he is joining the team so that he can rescue his fianc√© however, Blade puts him to sleep to stop him following them. Meanwhile, the shapeshifters bring Doom into the cell with Wiccan in the hopes that they can use his magic to gain Doom's knowledge. Wiccan is initially nervous due to Doom's history with his mother but quickly determines that they shapeshifters have captured a Doombot and have no idea that it is not the real Doctor Doom. Wiccan animated the Doombot and uses it to escape from his captors just as the rest of the team arrives to rescue him. Angel duels against one of the shapeshifters but she escapes. Spectrum uses her powers to locate a hidden prisoner and the team rescue him before Daimon and the Winter Soldier destroy the prison.Strikeforce #3 The team seek refuge in one of Doom's safehouses while they wait for the prisoner to wake up. Winter Soldier reveals that during the War, he was captured by a creature that took his shape and tried to kill Captain America although he was able to stop it before it could. He believes that this shapeshifter is the same one that Blade fought during his vampire hunt. Daimon similarly recounts a story about how he was fighting some cultists alongside his ex-girlfriend Hellcat and that, despite rekindling their relationship that night, he received a phone call from her the next day chastising him for bringing girls back to the Defender's safehouse, theorising that the Hellcat he fought alongside was a shapeshifter. Spider-Woman storms off, unable to cope after her own history with shapeshifters. Angela goes after her and Spider-Woman tells her that she almost killed her own son after believing he had been replaced by a shapeshifter, admitting that she feels guilty. Angela announces to the group that all of their stories about past experiences with the shapeshifters are lies that have been implanted, arguing that these shapeshifters had never left Asgard until recently. They are interrupted when Ghost attacks Spectrum, knocking her unconscious. The team go after him while Wiccan and Daimon stay with Spectrum and the prisoner. Wiccan reveals that he knows Daimon is purposefully preventing the prisoner from waking up and confronts him about why he was working with the shapeshifters in the first place. Daimon explains that they approached him seeking his help with a magic ritual that would help them find a home after landing on Earth. Spectrum, Angela, Blade, Winter Soldier and Spier-Woman track Ghost to a small hospital where they discover he has been working with Moonstone to try and bring people back from the dead. They discover that Spectrum can use her powers to guide the souls back into their bodies shortly after death and they manipulate her into reviving them.Strikeforce #4-5 Team roster { class=\\" collapsible\\" style=\\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\\" + List of Strikeforce team members, showing real names and issue where they joined the team ! scope=\\"col\\" Character ! scope=\\"col\\" Real name ! scope=\\"col\\" Joined in -  Angela  Aldrif Odinsdottir  rowspan=\\"7\\" Strikeforce #1 (September 2019) -  Blade  Eric Brooks -  colspan=\\"2\\" Daimon Hellstrom -  Spectrum  Monica Rambeau -  Spider-Woman  Jessica Drew -  Wiccan  William \\"Billy\\" Kaplan -  Winter Soldier  James Buchanan \\"Bucky\\" Barnes - } Collected editions {  center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Material Collected ! scope=\\"col\\"  Format ! scope=\\"col\\"  Publication date ! scope=\\"col\\"  ISBN -  Strikeforce - Volume 1 - Trust Me  Strikeforce #1-5  rowspan=\\"2\\" Trade paperback  February 25, 2020  -  Strikeforce - Volume 2 - Fight Me  Strikeforce #6-9  December 8, 2020  } References ","title":"Strikeforce (comics)"},{"id":"62396183","text":"Beate Hofmann (born October 15, 1963 in Bad T√∂lz) is a German Lutheran bishop.

On 8 July 2005 it was formally included as an 'Archaeological Protected Monument' by the government. The Victorian-style building, features three white stone arches on the ground floor, with an open verandah and cast iron balustrades on the first floor, supported by four stone doric columns, and a half round tile roof. The entire upstairs floor has polished wooden floorboards on timber beams. The upstairs verandah commands a view over Kandy Lake and provides a viewing platform for guests to watch the Kandy Esala Perahera. The hotel was used as a pub in the 1940s/50s but was converted by the owners into a guest house/budget hotel in the 1970s. It has 14 bedrooms upstairs, with the entrance being from Colombo Road at the back of the building. The hotel has communal bathrooms for guests. In July 2010 the hotel caught fire, sustaining damage to the upper floor and roof. It was subsequently repaired and restored.

John DiLeva Halpern is a documentary filmmaker, protest art provocateur, and performance artist based in New York City. He is known for cultural activism and documentaries about art, artists, and Tibetan Buddhism. Career Cultural activism In 1977, Halpern co-founded Art Corporation of America Incorporated. Collaborative performances included Bridging, an artist's uprising \\"media sculpture\\" in 1977. \\"To replace violence and fear in mass media for one day\\" seven artists, wearing brightly colored jump-suits and safety harnesses, climbed the seven largest bridges connected to Manhattan. \\"Each executed an individual work or performance atop their bridge. At the peak of their collective ascents, bright yellow smoke flares were ignited on each bridge, unifying the artists as a team,\\" resulting in rush hour traffic disruption and media attention. The artists/climbers, also including Greg Pickard, Paul Pellicoro, Jack Bashkow, Gianfranco Mantegna, Tony Sapp, Anthony Seidenberg, Janet Applegate and peace activist Ruth Russell, were arrested. Charges were later dismissed. Conceptual artist and provocateur Joseph Beuys described it as \\"the first social-sculpture to use mass-media as art.‚Äù ABC's Eyewitness News named it 1977's Best News of the Year. The piece garnered international attention and the cover of the New York Post. His film Bridging, 1977 documented the event. In 1979, Halpern attempted another \\"bridging\\" \\"social sculpture,\\" planting gunpowder, fireworks, batteries and a radio receiver in a bucket on a tower of the Brooklyn Bridge. This led to his arrest for possessing a bomb. A 24-hour performance in 1979 - 1980 by the Art Corporation of America comprised digging a 10-foot hole on Spring Street between Mott and Elizabeth Streets in Soho, where 12 - 15 people planned \\"to stay in the hole to see the New Year in, \\"discussing art and politics.\\"\\" From the late 1980s through the 1990s Halpern created public interactive art and media sculptures internationally. His work gave viewers the artist's point of view with the motto ‚ÄúConsumers are the producers of the future.‚Äù In Smokesculpture over 1000 participants breathed cigarette smoke into a large plastic bag which was mailed back to cigarette manufacturers, in 1988. In Breathsculpture he lived in an hermetically sealed glass house for 10 days with 10,000 plants, breathing once per minute, in Holland in 1989. Fresh Air brought mobile, interactive breathing stations filled with plants to the street. Over 100,000 people participated in America and Europe starting in 1990. Documentaries His 1988 film, Transformer/Joseph Beuys is an \\"influential portrait\\" of Beuys preparing for the only retrospective done in his lifetime, in 1979 at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan. Billed as a Joseph Beuys and John Halpern Collaboration, Beuys led Halpern through the exhibition as he personally narrated and installed his artwork. Produced by I.T.A.P. Pictures and Ronald Feldman Fine Arts Gallery, the film is in many collections. In 2006, he looked at how Westerners have been increasingly drawn to Eastern philosophy and Tibetan Buddhism in the film Refuge. That same year, with Les Levine, he also directed Talking with the Dalai Lama featuring the 14th Dalai Lama with Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, Tenzin Palmo, and David Chadwick. Filmmakers and artists who explored Buddhism in their work, Kundun director Martin Scorsese, screenwriter Melissa Mathison, and music composer Philip Glass; Oliver Stone, director of Heaven and Earth; Dzongzar Khyentse Rinpoche, director of The Cup; and Bernardo Bertolucci, director of Little Buddha, were also interviewed. Halpern directed and produced Saving Lieb House in 2010 with Jim Venturi, son of architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott- Brown. The 30 minute film, about saving a 1960s Pop Art house they designed from demolition, followed the house being moved 200 miles by barge from Big Island, New Jersey to Manhattan. Anti-cycling activism On September 25, 2019, John was the featured speaker at a Park Slope meeting hosted by Myra Manning of Citizens United for Safety, an anti-cycling group. He opened by accusing pro-cycling organization Transportation Alternatives of planting \\"paid activists\\" in the crowd, alleging that their funding \\"comes from the likes of billionaire Steve Ross, a crony of Jeff Epstein, and an elite group of backers.\\" Other activities Halpern has written about Tibetan issues, and taught film at the Pratt Institute and the New York Film Academy.

Her real name was Masayo Brackin ( Ito).  Biography  Mori was born Masayo Ito in Shizuoka, Japan on November 4, 1940. Shortly after she was born, she and her parents moved to Inner Mongolia. Her father worked there throughout World War II. When the war ended, they returned to Japan and lived in Tokyo. She studied violin, and enjoyed Western films and novels, especially the works of Francois Sagan, who her works were later compared with. She graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts in 1961. However, instead of becoming a professional violinist, she ended up working for an advertising firm. She married an Englishman named Ivan Brackin in 1964 and raised three children with him. Mori began writing in 1978. Her first story, Joji (ÊÉÖ‰∫ã), won the Subaru Literary Award. She also wrote essays about her life and international travel. She wrote prolifically until she died of cancer on July 6, 1993.  Style  Mori usually wrote about boring or unhappy marriages and middle-aged women rebelling against them by having affairs. There were very rarely happy endings, and after their affairs the protagonists typically found themselves in the same position as when the story began. Her stories were compared to Harlequin romances, gothic novels, and American soap operas. Her popularity came from an excellent understanding of social conditions in Japan during the 1980s, and she used that to write stories that fulfilled women's fantasies. For that reason, her novels were very popular.

It is a generalization of the graph removal lemma. The special case in which the graph is a tetrahedron is known as the tetrahedron removal lemma. It was first proved by Gowers and, independently, by Nagle, R√∂dl, Schacht and Skokan. The hypergraph removal lemma can be used to prove, for instance, Szemer√©di's theorem, and multi- dimensional Szemer√©di's theorem.  Statement  Let H be any r-regular hypergraph with v(H) vertices. The hypergraph removal lemma states that for any \\\\varepsilon > 0, there exists \\\\delta = \\\\delta(\\\\varepsilon, H) > 0 such that the following is true: if G is any n-vertex r-regular hypergraph with at most \\\\delta n^{v(H)} subgraphs isomorphic to H, then it is possible to eliminate all copies of H from G by removing at most \\\\varepsilon n^r hyperedges from G. An equivalent formulation is that, for any graph G with o(n^{v(H)}) copies of H, we can eliminate all copies of H from G by removing o(n^r) hyperedges.  Proof idea  The high level idea of the proof is similar to that of graph removal lemma. We prove a hypergraph version of Szemer√©di's regularity lemma (partition hypergraphs into pseudorandom blocks) and a counting lemma (estimate the number of hypergraphs in an appropriate pseudorandom block). The key difficulty in the proof is to define the correct notion of hypergraph regularity. There were multiple attempts to define \\"partition\\" and \\"pseudorandom (regular) blocks\\" in a hypergraph, but none of them are able to give a strong counting lemma. The first correct definition of Szemer√©di's regularity lemma for general hypergraphs is given by R√∂dl et al. In Szemer√©di's regularity lemma, the partitions are performed on vertices (1-hyperedge) to regulate edges (2-hyperedge). However, for k>2, if we simply regulate k-hyperedges using only 1-hyperedge, we will lose information of all j-hyperedges in the middle where 1, and fail to find a counting lemma. The correct version has to partition (k-1)-hyperedges in order to regulate k-hyperedges. To gain more control of the (k-1)-hyperedges, we can go a level deeper and partition on (k-2)-hyperedges to regulate them, etc. In the end, we will reach a complex structure of regulating hyperedges. For example, we demonstrate an informal 3-hypergraph version of Szemer√©di's regularity lemma, first given by Frankl and R√∂dl. Consider a partition of edgesE(K_n) = G^{(2)}_1\\\\cup\\\\dots\\\\cup G^{(2)}_l such that for most triples (i,j,k), there are a lot of triangles on top of \\\\left(G^{(2)}_i,G^{(2)}_j,G^{(2)}_k\\\\right). We say that \\\\left(G^{(2)}_i,G^{(2)}_j,G^{(2)}_k\\\\right) is \\"pseudorandom\\" in the sense that for all subgraphs A^{(2)}_i\\\\subset G^{(2)}_i with not too few triangles on top of \\\\left(A^{(2)}_i,A^{(2)}_j,A^{(2)}_k\\\\right), we have : \\\\leftd\\\\left(G^{(2)}_i,G^{(2)}_j,G^{(2)}_k\\\\right) - d\\\\left(A^{(2)}_i,A^{(2)}_j,A^{(2)}_k\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\le\\\\varepsilon, :where d(X, Y, Z) denotes the proportion of 3-regular hyperedge in G^{(3)} among all triangles on top of (X, Y, Z). We then subsequently define a regular partition as a partition in which the triples of parts that are not regular constitute at most an \\\\varepsilon fraction of all triples of parts in the partition. In addition to this, we need to further regularize G^{(2)}_1, \\\\dots, G^{(2)}_l via a partition of the vertex set. As a result, we have the total data of hypergraph regularity as follows: #a partition of E(K_n) into graphs such that G^{(3)} sits pseudorandomly on top; #a partition of V(G) such that the graphs in (1) are extremely pseudorandom (in a fashion resembling Szemer√©di's regularity lemma). After proving the hypergraph regularity lemma, we can prove a hypergraph counting lemma. The rest of proof proceeds similarly to that of Graph removal lemma.  Proof of Szemer√©di's theorem  Let r_k(N) be the size of the largest subset of \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, N\\\\\\\\} that does not contain a length k arithmetic progression. Szemer√©di's theorem states that, r_k(N) = o(N) for any constant k. The high level idea of the proof is that, we construct a hypergraph from a subset without any length k arithmetic progression, then use graph removal lemma to show that this graph cannot have too many hyperedges, which in turn shows that the original subset cannot be too big. Let A \\\\subset \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, N\\\\\\\\} be a subset that does not contain any length k arithmetic progression. Let M = k^2N + 1 be a large enough integer. We can think of A as a subset of \\\\mathbb{Z} / M\\\\mathbb{Z}. Clearly, if A doesn't have length k arithmetic progression in \\\\mathbb{Z}, it also doesn't have length k arithmetic progression in \\\\mathbb{Z} / M\\\\mathbb{Z}. We will construct a k-partite (k-1)-regular hypergraph G from A with parts V_1, V_2, \\\\ldots, V_k, all of which are M element vertex sets indexed by \\\\mathbb{Z} / M\\\\mathbb{Z}. For each 1 \\\\le i \\\\le k, we add a hyperedge among vertices (v_j \\\\in V_j)_{j \\\\in [k] \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}} if and only if \\\\sum_{j e i} (j-i) v_j \\\\in A. Let H be the complete k-partite (k-1)-regular hypergraph. If Gcontains an isomorphic copy of H with vertices v_1, \\\\ldots, v_k, then \\\\alpha_i = \\\\sum_{j e i} (j-i) v_j \\\\in A for any 1 \\\\le i \\\\le j. However, note that \\\\alpha_i is a length k arithmetic progression with common difference \\\\alpha_{i+1}-\\\\alpha_i = -\\\\sum_{j} v_j. Since A has no length k arithmetic progression, it must be the case that \\\\alpha_1 = \\\\cdots = \\\\alpha_k, so \\\\sum_{j} v_j = 0. Thus, for each hyperedge (v_j \\\\in V_j)_{j \\\\in [k] \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}}, we can find a unique copy of H that this edge lies in by finding v_i = -\\\\sum_{j e i} v_j. The number of copies of H in G equals \\\\frac{1}{k} e(G) = O(N^{k-1}) = o(N^k). Therefore, by the hypergraph removal lemma, we can remove o(N^{k-1}) edges to eliminate all copies of H in G. Since every hyperedge of G is in a unique copy of H, to eliminate all copies of H in G, we need to remove at least e(G) / k edges. Thus, e(G) = o(N^{k-1}). The number of hyperedges in G is kM^{k-2}A = o(N^{k-1}), which concludes that A = o(N). This method usually does not give a good quantitative bound, since the hidden constants in hypergraph removal lemma involves the inverse Ackermann function. For a better quantitive bound, Gowers proved that A \\\\le \\\\frac{N}{(\\\\log \\\\log N)^{c_k}} for some constant c_k depending on k. It is the best bound for k \\\\ge 5 so far.  Applications  * The hypergraph removal lemma is used to prove the multidimensional Szemer√©di theorem by J. Solymosi. The statement is that any for any finite subset S of \\\\mathbb{Z}^r, any \\\\delta>0 and any n large enough, any subset of [n]^r of size at least \\\\delta n^r contains a subset of the form a\\\\cdot S + d, that is, a dilated and translated copy of S. Corners theorem is a special case when S=\\\\\\\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)\\\\\\\\}. * It is also used to prove the polynomial Szemer√©di theorem, the finite field Szemer√©di theorem and the finite abelian group Szemer√©di theorem.

American Brooke Ammerman Reimer was again the top point-getter for ESC Planegg, with 5 goals and 1 assist (6 points), and ranked fifth on the list of top scorers of the group. Planegg‚Äôs net-minder, Julia Graunke, also had a solid performance, with a 93.88 save percentage and 1.99 goals against average, placing second on the list of the group‚Äôs top goaltenders. Though she received no plaudits and her goaltending statistics appear mediocre at best, Hvidovre IK goaltender Amalie Joa faced nearly 90 more shots on goal than any other netminder of Group E and her 132 saves across three games are an accomplishment worthy of mention.

The group featured Round 1 winners Aisulu Almaty of Group B and the EHV Sabres Vienna of Group D, and introduced the reigning Finnish Champions, the Espoo Blues of the Naisten SM-sarja, and the reigning Swedish Champions, AIK Hockey of the Riksserien. AIK Hockey won the group, helped in no small part by the 92.68 save percentage posted by goaltender Minatsu Murase, the second best of the group, and depth scoring. The Espoo Blues placed second and claimed the top four point scorers of the group: forwards Linda V√§lim√§ki, with 8 points (2 goals + 6 assists), Emma Nuutinen, with 7 points (4 goals + 3 assists), and Annina Rajahuhta, with 7 points (1 goal + 6 assists), and defender Emma Terho, with 5 points (3 goals + 2 assists). The Blues were plagued by poor net-minding and, despite out-scoring the three other teams, ended the round with a goal differential of just +1. Victoria Vigilanti was excellent in net for the EHV Sabres, earning the best save percentage of the round, a 92.77, and 2.00 goals against average. Minatsu Murase of AIK Hockey concluded the round with a save percentage less than a tenth of a percentage point behind Vigilanti and a 1.50 goals against average, out performing the Sabres‚Äô goalie by 0.50 GAA.

Canadian goaltender Jillian Marie MacIsaac of Aisulu Almaty was named ‚ÄúBest Goalkeeper‚Äù of the group. MacIsaac played every minute of Aisulu‚Äôs three matches and made 84 saves on 93 shots on goal, the most shots faced and saves made by any goalie in the group. Swedish defenceman Linnea Hedin of AIK Hockey was named ‚ÄúBest Defenseman.‚Äù Sixteen year old Finnish forward Emma Nuutinen was named ‚ÄúBest Forward,‚Äù having scored the most goals and the second-most points of any player in the group.

The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Season nine stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis's eldest son Adam; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis's husband Dex Dexter; Emma Samms as Blake and Alexis' daughter Fallon; John James as Fallon's ex-husband Jeff Colby; Leann Hunley as Adam's wife Dana; Stephanie Beacham as Alexis's cousin Sable Colby; Tracy Scoggins as Sable's daughter Monica; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven, and Amanda. Development David Paulsen joined Dynasty as Executive Supervising Producer for its ninth season, and took over the plotting of the series. In a money-saving move, Evans appeared in only six episodes early in the season as an ailing Krystle seeks brain surgery in Switzerland but is left in an offscreen coma. Similarly to cut costs, Collins was contracted for only 13 out of the season's 22 episodes. Former The Colbys character Sable (Stephanie Beacham) was brought in as both a platonic confidante for Blake and a nemesis for Alexis, and Tracy Scoggins also reprised her Colbys role as Sable's daughter Monica. The series moved from Wednesday to Thursday, but ratings continued to decline and Dynasty was ranked #69 in the United States for the season. In May 1989, new ABC entertainment president Robert A. Iger cancelled Dynasty, making the last episode of season nine the series finale. The show ended on a cliffhanger with Blake, Fallon, Krystina, Alexis, and Dex in mortal peril.

Plot Wally Weldon works as a ranch hand on Colonel Jim Sterner's ranch, reporting in to Longrope Wheeler, the foreman, and someone who Sterner trusts implicitly. One day while out on the range, Weldon comes across Jim Bradley, a young man who Weldon learns is searching for his father. Taking pity on the youth, he brings him back to the ranch, where he knows there's an opening as a cook's helper. One day, Bradley walks in on Longrope and the cook trying to open Sterner's safe and rob him. Bradley attempts to get away, but is shot by the cook, who then attempts to flee himself. Weldon hunts the cook down and captures him, delivering him to the local sheriff. Back at the ranch, seeing Bradley in bed, Sterner realizes that he is his long lost son. In jail the cook admits to shooting Bradley, and also tells the sheriff that he knows that Longrope was the man who murdered a cattle association representative. Weldon rushes back to the ranch, where he finds Longrope trying once again to open the safe. Weldon overpowers him, and takes him back to the sheriff.

She was diagnosed with the illness at age 14. In an interview with i-D magazine in 2018, Hale recalled being sensitive to things that other kids weren‚Äôt, like light and sound, but said that without a proper diagnosis, she had no idea why. ‚ÄúI always noticed that I was obsessive with media, to the point where I‚Äôd be with my friends and I‚Äôd be really obsessed with a song.

It was first described to science in 1872 by George Washington Tryon Jr.  Description  The elegant lucine has large, flattened, saucer-like valves. They are the largest member of their family along the west coast of the Americas. The valves are between 50mm and 140mm (2 to 5.5 inches) in width. The exterior of the shell is white with a vivid reticulation, or net- like sculpture of rays and arcs. The interior of the shell shows rose-red margins with a creamy yellow center.  Distribution  The elegant lucine is found in the east Pacific Ocean from Baja California to Peru, including the Gulf of California. It is found in the Galapagos Islands. It is a shallow water species that lives from the intertidal zone to 50 meters (165 feet) deep. Elegant lucines are infaunal, that is they live buried in sand or mud on the seabed.  Life history  The elegant lucine is a filter feeder, straining plankton and other nutrients from sea water that it pumps through its body. These animals also obtain energy through chemosymbiosis. They acquire their symbiotic bacteria from sea water. The bacteria are bathed in the sea water pumping through the gills of the animal from which they obtain sulfides and oxygen.

Early life and education  Harada was born on January 12, 1928 in Tokyo. She and her family moved to Kushiro, Hokkaido when she was a year old for her father's job. After getting tuberculosis as a child, she had many health problems, including nephritis. She read a lot while she was ill in bed, especially fairy tales from foreign countries. She began writing her own fairy tales during World War II. Toward the end of the war she had to work in a factory as part of the National Mobilization Law. She hated it. After the war, Harada worked as a reporter for the Kushiro newspaper. She married Yoshio Sasaki in 1951.  Career  Harada's first books were serialized in magazines while she worked as a reporter. Her first published story, \\"Fuyu no ame\\", was published in 1949 in the Hokkaido Bungaku magazine. In 1954, her short story \\"Sabita no kioku\\" was praised by Shinch≈ç as one of the best short stories of the year, but ultimately did not win their literary prize. Her novel won a Women's Literature Prize, and was her only bestseller. It was made into a film that was directed by Heinosuke Gosho.

Style  Harada's works were popular with young women in their twenties and thirties. Harada's books are usually about sensitive young women who suffer from various ailments. Her protagonists often long for the kind of love where they can feel protected and understood, but still have freedom and self-determination. Many of her books take place in her native Hokkaido. Harada's style has been compared to Francois Sagan, but though she has more courage when writing difficult scenes, he has a better way with words.

Byne's first noted essay on \\"The Great Queen Isabel\\" was published in Harper's Monthly Magazine in June 1912. Her most famous book is Christopher Columbus, a popular biography that brought new research done in Spanish to English-speaking audiences. Seventeen editions have been published between 1915 and 2012. Both members of the couple were corresponding members of the Hispanic Society of America, and served as curators of architecture and applied arts from 1916 to 1921. In 1921, the Bynes ended their relationship with the HSA and settled permanently in Madrid. Through their friend Julia Morgan, the couple helped American collector William Randolph Hearst acquire Spanish art and decorative items. After 1921, the Bynes established themselves as dealers. They also served as historical consultants for Spanish colonial and colonial-style houses in California. Their work was widely praised, and one reviewer wrote of one of their books: \\"A book like this is a stimulant to the creative faculty.\\" In 1931, couple bought a home in Madrid built in 1885 by Don Manuel Caldero, the Marqu√©s de Salamanca.

The particle has been proposed to explain wide angles observed in the trajectory paths of particles produced during a nuclear transition of beryllium-8 atoms and in stable helium atoms. The X17 particle could be the force carrier for a postulated fifth force, possibly connected with dark matter, and has been described as a protophobic (i.e., ignoring protons) X boson with a mass near . History In 2015, Krasznahorkay and his colleagues at ATOMKI, the Hungarian Institute for Nuclear Research, posited the existence of a new, light boson weighing about (34 times heavier than the electron). In an effort to find a dark photon, the team fired protons at thin targets of lithium-7, which created unstable beryllium-8 nuclei that then decayed and produced pairs of electrons and positrons. Excess decays were observed at an opening angle of 140¬∞ between the e+ and e‚àí particles and a combined energy of approximately . This indicated that a small fraction of beryllium-8 might shed its excess energy in the form of a new particle. The result was successfully repeated by the team. In 2016, Jonathan Feng et al. proposed that a protophobic X-boson, with a mass of , suppressed couplings to protons relative to neutrons, and electrons at femtometer range, could explain the data. The force may explain the g‚àí2 muon anomaly and provide a dark matter candidate. , several research experiments are underway to attempt to validate or refute these results. In October 2019, Krasznahorkay posted a preprint announcing that he and his team at ATOMKI had successfully observed the same anomalies in the decay of stable helium atoms as had been observed in beryllium-8, strengthening the case for the existence of the X17 particle. This was covered in science journalism, focusing largely on the implications that the existence of the X17 particle and a corresponding fifth force would have in the search for dark matter. Criticism , the ATOMKI paper describing the particle has not been peer reviewed and should therefore be considered preliminary. Furthermore, efforts by CERN and other groups to independently detect the particle have been unsuccessful. The ATOMKI group had claimed to find various other new particles earlier in 2016 but abandoned these claims later, without an explanation of what caused the spurious signals. The group has also been accused of cherry-picking results that support new particles while discarding null results. The X17 particle is not consistent with the Standard Model, so its existence would need to be explained by another theory.

Bethune-Hill, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a case argued before the United States Supreme Court on March 18, 2019, in which the Virginia House of Delegates appealed against the decision in 2018 by the district court that 11 of Virginia's voting districts were racially gerrymandered, and thus unconstitutional. The Court held the \\"Virginia House of Delegates lacks standing to file this appeal, either representing the state's interests or in its own right.\\", 139 S. Ct. 1945, 1951 (2019). In other words, the court upheld the decision made by a federal district court ruling in June 2018 that 11 state legislative districts were an illegal racial gerrymander. This was following a previous (2017) case, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections., 137 S. Ct. 788 (2017).  Background  In 2011, Virginia was subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited the redistricting process from eliminating districts that were made largely of minority groups to discourage their preferred candidates from taking office. Delegate Steven Christopher Jones from the Virginia House of Delegates ensured there were 11 voting districts in which 55% of the voters were African American. By isolating the \\"African American vote,\\" Jones' actions allowed for populations of the remaining state districts in Virginia to remain dominantly white, securing Republican seats in Virginia's House. Virginia has 100 seats in the House and 40 in the Senate. On December 22, 2014, in Virginia, 12 voters filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia that the government participated in racial gerrymandering and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. However, the district court rejected the argument, dismissing the case on October 22, 2015. The plaintiffs appealed the decision, which the Supreme Court accepted.Bethune-Hill v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 136 S. Ct. 2406 (2016) (noting probable jurisdiction). On March 1, 2017, the Supreme Court decided in a 7-1 majority opinion that the district court that held the case had \\"applied the wrong legal standards in evaluating the challengers' claims of racial gerrymandering.\\" Therefore, the court upheld only one of the districts and dismissed the rest of the case for the district court, allowing the district court to reconsider the constitutionality of the remaining 11 districts. Eventually, in June 2018, the lower court deemed the 11 districts unconstitutional, concluding that race was a substantial factor in determining the boundaries of the districts. The Virginia House of Delegates had attempted to place the exact same percentage of African-American voters in each of the districts, claiming that it was necessary to do so in order to comply with federal voting-rights laws. However, the lower court did not find the government's actions necessary, and thus declared the 11 districts unconstitutional. The district court gave the legislature until October 30, 2018 to redraw district lines. However, the redrawing of district lines was met with partisan conflicts, as Republicans feared that redrawing the lines would threaten their majority in the House while the Democrats supported an end to Virginia's racial gerrymandering. Amongst the conflict, the Virginia House of Delegates appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which agreed to review the case and whether the Virginia House of Delegates had standing to appeal. The Virginia House of Delegates had filed the appeal independently of Virginia's State Attorney General who claimed the State would not appeal the case.  Standing of the plaintiff  The plaintiff took the standing that in order to pursue a litigation, the party must be harmed by the resolution of the litigation. While the State as a primary defendant has standing to litigate, the Virginia House alone is not believed to have standing to litigate. Justices were divided on the issue in a seemingly split despite of political party affiliation.  Questions facing the court  The Supreme Court faced this case with the following three questions in mind. Did the district (lower) court have enough evidence to declare that the Virginia House of Delegates was in fact gerrymandering the 11 districts? Did the district court make a mistake in holding that the Virginia House of Delegates \\"did not satisfy its burden to show that the legislature's use of race was narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest of compliance with Section 5 of the VRA 52 U.S.C. ¬ß 10304?\\" Does the Virginia House of Delegates have standing to file an appeal? Whether the district court erred in relying on expert analysis it previously rejected as unreliable and irrelevant and expert analysis that lacked any objective or coherent methodology?  Conclusion of the case  In a 5-4 majority in the Roberts Court, the Supreme Court held that \\"the Virginia House of Delegates lacks standing to file this appeal, either representing the state's interests or in its own right.\\" Justices Thomas, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Gorsuch all voted in favor of rejecting the appeal while Justices Roberts, Breyer, Alito, and Kavanaugh voted to support it. Ultimately, the Virginia House Republicans were not successful in their appeal which allowed Democrats to become the majority in the Virginia bicameral legislature in the 2019 elections for the first time since 1995.  Opinion of the Court  Image of the Virginia House of Delegates Chamber in 2017 In order for to file for appeal, the litigant must have judicial standing. In other words, this means that the litigant must show a \\"concrete and particularized injury, that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\\" Because the Virginia House of Delegates served as an intervenor, it must file for appeal on its own standing. However, the court decided that the House of Delegates did not demonstrate standing on its own and thus cannot challenge the result of the case in court. In order to determine whether the House of Delegates had standing, the court had to consider whether the House represented both the state's interests and its own. In Virginia, \\"the authority of representing the state's interests in civil litigation lies exclusively with the state attorney general.\\" In this situation, Attorney General Mark R. Herring had states that he did not want to appeal the case. Since the attorney general is not tied to the House of Delegates, the House therefore does not have standing to file an appeal on behalf of Virginia. The House also never indicated that it was representing the State in the District Court, thus the House was only representing its own interests. In reference to whether the House of Delegates has standing on its own, the Court again concluded that it does not, stating that a \\"judicial decision invalidating state law\\" did not inflict any injury to the House of Delegates. In response to the majority opinion of the court, Justice Samuel Alito, backed by the other dissenting judges, stated that the House did in fact have standing because the new redistricting plan would injure the House by affecting who was elected to it. Alito was critical of the impermissible blurring of the standings of the congress and state legislatures. He believed separation of powers is not required for state legislative standings.  Voting Rights Act of 1965  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 states that \\"No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\\" In other words, Section 2 mandates that the drawing of electoral districts cannot \\"improperly dilute minorities' voting power.\\" Along with the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act ensures that citizens are offered equal representation, specifically through the voting process.  Redistricting  The redrawing of state district lines, also known as redistricting, has a tremendous effect in creating more competition amongst future candidates in the state legislature. Jennifer Clark, a political science professor at the University of Houston, commented on redistricting, stating that \\"The redistricting process has important consequences for voters. In some states, incumbent legislators work together to protect their own seats, which produces less competition in the political system. Voters may feel as though they do not have a meaningful alternative to the incumbent legislator. Legislators who lack competition in their districts have less incentive to adhere to their constituents' opinions.\\" In 2006, Emory University professor Alan Abramowitz and Ph.D. students Brad Alexander and Matthew Gunning also commented on redistricting, stating that \\"[Some] studies have concluded that redistricting has a neutral or positive effect on competition. ... [It] is often the case that partisan redistricting has the effect of reducing the safety of incumbents, thereby making elections more competitive.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2019 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United States elections case law Category:Gerrymandering Category:Virginia General Assembly ","title":"Virginia House of Delegates v.

She was a professor at Chulalongkorn University, where she founded the Faculty of Education and was its first dean, and contributed extensively to the development of teacher education and education administration in Thailand. She has been recognized as one of the foremost contributors to education in the country. Early life Poonsapaya was born on 12 October 1910 in tambon Si Kak Phraya Si (now in Bangkok's Phra Nakhon District). She was originally named Nu (). Her father, Hans Geyer, was a German expatriate jeweller who had frequent contact with the royal ladies in Phayathai Palace; her mother Mrs Chiam was a lady-in-waiting of Suan Sunanda Palace. At the age of three-and-a-half, her parents presented her to Queen Saovabha Phongsri, who gave her the name Poonsapaya, and placed her under the care of Princess Valaya Alongkorn. (Poonsapaya would later adopt the Thai-icized surname Kraiyong ().) She grew up in the palace, and attended Rajini School. She graduated from the Faculty of Arts and Science at Chulalongkorn University and joined the civil service, before earning a scholarship for a master's degree in education psychology at the University of Michigan. She had begun a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison when Thailand joined World War II against the United States. The government ordered her return, but she decided to join the Free Thai resistance movement as a radio broadcaster assisting the Allies instead. Career Poonsapaya worked at Chulalongkorn University, the alma mater from which she graduated in 1931. After the war, Poonsapaya briefly audited at Columbia University before returning to Thailand. (She would later receive a graduate diploma in education administration from Columbia in 1963.) She then began working at Chulalongkorn University. At the time, the university's teacher training programme was a department under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (now the Faculty of Arts), teaching a one-year course. Poonsapaya pushed for its expansion into a two-year programme, and later worked to establish a full faculty. The Faculty of Education was founded in 1957. Poonsapaya served as its dean‚Äîthe first woman in Thailand to hold such a position‚Äîuntil her retirement fourteen years later, after which she continued teaching as professor emeritus. She introduced new theories and processes, including seminar classes and the course credit system. The Chulalongkorn University Demonstration School was also established for teacher training and education research under her leadership. Personal life and recognition Poonsapaya also worked toward the advancement of women. She founded the Thailand chapter of Zonta International, as well as the Thai Association of University Women. She and her husband, Mom Luang Chirayu Navawongs, whom she married in 1952, also contributed to various other charitable causes (they had no children). Following her husband's death in 2003, she donated their residence to serve as a learning centre. It is now known as the Chirayu‚ÄìPoonsapaya Museum and Discovery Learning Library. Poonsapaya's health deteriorated following a stroke around 2012. She died of leukaemia on 23 October 2015, aged 105, at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Her cremation on 5 June 2016 was presided over by Princess Sirindhorn. Poonsapaya received multiple honours and awards for her work. She was appointed Dame Grand Commander of the Order of Chula Chom Klao in 1986, granting her the title Thanphuying. Chulalongkorn University named her its first Venerable Professor in 1990.

She is also a former alderman with Alice Springs Town Council and served from 1984‚Äì1992.  Early life  Castagna was born in Italy and she migrated to Australia with her parents in 1947. In Australia the Castanga family worked on a remote mica mine, approx. 250 km from Alice Springs. The family were very poor and slept head-to-toe in the same bed. In 1952, when boarding at the Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Convent School, Castagna contracted polio and was the first case of polio to be admitted to the Alice Springs Hospital, although an epidemic of the virus would follow, and she was soon transferred to Adelaide by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Polio caused Castagna to become a Quadriplegic. Following her recovery from the virus, Castagna was placed in the 'Somerton Crippled Home' where she would stay for seven years; her only regular visit hear was her grandfather once a fortnight while, due to the expense, her parents were only able to visit every two years. Her care in this home was impersonal and she felt isolated and this gave her a passion for disability advocacy. It was intended that Castagna would remain in care for the rest of her life, she was regularly told that she would die before she turned 30, but, with the intervention of Don Broad, her physiotherapist she was allowed to come back to Central Australia, where her family were now living in Alice Springs to live with them.  Career  Upon returning to Alice Springs Castagna started working at the Sunny Centre (now known as Acacia Hill School), which caters for students with intellectual and physical disabilities. Castagna worked with children with Down Syndrome. A local club, the Quota Club, assisted Castagna and organised volunteers to drive her to and from work.

She was born in Tokyo out-of-wedlock to parents who encouraged her to develop hobbies considered \\"unusual\\" for a girl, including carpentry. While at Meiji University, she joined the English Speaking Society and became its first female officer. She graduated in 1967. Ochiai was a radio celebrity in the 1970s and often DJ-ed under the name \\"Lemon-chan.\\" She gained popularity through her novel advice show, in which listeners could call in and describe their problems in order to receive her advice in real time. She has also written about jazz. She published a widely acclaimed series of essays about women in Japanese cities titled A Spoonful of Happiness (Suppun Ippai no Shiawase) based on her newspaper columns. In 1982, she wrote The Rape (Za reipu), about the lawsuit of the rape of an independent young career woman (kyaria≈´man) by her ex-boyfriend. In the novel, Ochiai establishes that women have the right to decide with whom they decide to be intimate‚Äîa radical idea at the time in Japan. She also introduces the phrase \\"penis fascination\\" to describe male obsession with sexual dominance. In 1994, she published The Second Rape, still untranslated into English. A 2017 article stated that she had published over 130 books and essays. In 1976, she founded a children's bookstore named \\"Crayonhouse\\" (or \\"Crayon House\\") in Tokyo. According to the store's website, the store looks at culture through the point of view of children and of women, with a special focus on vegetarianism and organic products. She has stated that it was founded based on \\"my belief that a society that is kind to children, that thinks about the happiness of future generations, is a society where anyone can live happily.\\" Since the 1970s, Ochiai has been outspoken about men who grope women on crowded subways (a topic known as \\"chikan\\" or \\"pervert\\"), stating that the way to stop the problem is to raise awareness. Inspired by the Fukushima Daichii nuclear disaster, Ochiai has held monthly workshops on the problems of nuclear power called \\"Morning Study of Silent Spring,\\" a nod to her blog \\"Journal of Silent Spring,\\" which is also a reference to Rachel Carson's environmentalist classic Silent Spring. These workshops started in May 2011 and are held at Crayonhouse. She remains an advocate of alternative power sources. Ochiai has never been married and is proud of her single status, seeing it as a key way of keeping her independence. She is also outspoken about the discrimination she faced as a child born out-of-wedlock.

Endo had previously created titles such as TISTA and Gekka Bijin, and his current work is SPYxFAMILY, which is published in Jump+ and boasted over 800,000 volumes both in digital and physical sales within its first two volumes. His work is published in various Jump magazines.  Early life  Ever since childhood, Endo aspired to become a manga artist. His family consisted of one parent and a brother. His favorite actors and actresses are Bruce Lee, Hiroshi Abe, Meg Ryan and Odrey Toto. His favourite manga artists are Akira Toriyama, Hiroyuki Nishimori, and Minetar≈ç Mochizuki. His hobbies include skiing, basketball, and racket-based ball games.  Career  Before debuting, Endo worked as an assistant for the manga series' Blue Exorcist and Fire Punch. He was mentored by manga artists Kanou YasuhroKano Masahiro \\"Pretty Face\\" Volume 6 p.206 and Yoshiyuki Nishi.Yoshiyuki Nishi, \\"Muhyo and Rosie's Magic Legal Consultation Office\\" Volume 2 p.114 Like many manga artists, Endo began his career creating one-shots. Some of these one off stories would have influences towards his later manga. After finishing TISTA and Gekka Bijin for Jump Square and finishing three one-shots with editor Shihei Lin, who Endo had known and worked with for more than 10 years, the two began to plan for a series that would feature in Sh≈çnen Jump+. This manga would combine what Lin thought were the strengths of Endo's previous works; Rengoku no Ashe, Ishi ni Usubeni, Tetsu ni Hoshi and ISpy, creating SPYxFAMILY. Lin claimed that the reception for SPYxFAMILY from their editorial department was so good that its serialization was \\"practically decided\\" before an official meeting for it took place. SPYxFAMILY would go on to become part of the top ten most popular manga on their website as of 2019.

This is especially true for his early titles TISTA and Rengoku no Ashe which are about a serial killer and witch hunting respectively. After working on so much manga with dark tones, his editor, Shihei Lin, encouraged Endo to come up with a more \\"bright and cheerful manga\\". The one-shot, ISpy, could be seen as a transition piece between Endo's dark and bright narratives, as it incorporates the mature themes of his early work while still being a \\"cheerful title\\" like Lin had suggested. His work in SPYxFAMILY is the first that completely deviates into what is more considered a cheerful manga. His editor claims that Endo likes to think through every detail of a plot. When proposed with an idea about his story, Endo will quickly point out any contradictions. This along with his need to create deep and well thought out characters has pushed him into telling stories that show a positive or negative shift in the psychological state of his characters. Endo always seeks to improve the quality of his work, so he reads lots of manga, novels, and books.

The Great Court, renamed Killian Court in 1974 after President James Rhyne Killian, faces the river and the Boston skyline and \\"emphasizes the institution's openness to the urban environment and fulfills Maclaurin's ambition.\\" Killian Court was originally hard-paved, but was converted into a park-like area of grass and trees in the late 1920s. Bosworth had planned to install a three-story-high statue of Minerva at the center of the court, but funds for this embellishment were never appropriated. Today, Killian Court is the site of the annual Commencement ceremony, and is otherwise used for studying, relaxing, and playing Frisbee games in good weather. Features The friezes of the marble- clad buildings surrounding Killian Court are carved in large Roman letters with the names of Aristotle, Newton, Franklin, Pastevr, Lavoisier, Faraday, Archimedes, da Vinci, Darwin, and Copernicvs; each of these names is surmounted by a cluster of appropriately related names in smaller letters. Lavoisier, for example, is placed in the company of Boyle, Cavendish, Priestley, Dalton, Gay Lvssac, Berzelivs, Woehler, Liebig, Bvnsen, Mendelejeff [sic], Perkin, and van't Hoff. The names are carved in the classic Roman square capitals using the Latin alphabet, with \\"V\\" instead of \\"U\\"; also, \\"I\\" should have been used instead of \\"J\\", since the latter letter of each pair did not exist in ancient times. Inexplicably, the letter \\"J\\" is used anyway, along with \\"W\\", which are both blatant anachronisms in the typographic styling of the inscriptions.

She was crowned Miss Jordan in 2010 and was the first runner-up in the Miss Arab beauty contest in 2011. Her online activism began following the release the video of the execution of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh and the 2015 attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, though elsewhere she has stated that she first reached out to hacktivists in November 2014. She is part of the hacktivist groups CtrlSec and \\"Ghost Security\\" (GSG), which work to block or suspend Twitter accounts, hack websites, and have propaganda videos removed from sites when these posts, tweets, or videos promote Islamic fundamentalist groups such as ISIS, Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, Al- Nusra, and Al-Shabaab. In November 2015, some members of Ghost Security decided to cooperate with government security forces, while others wanted to continue the anti-government stance of its parent organization Anonymous. Abdallat chose to side the former, and this branch of the group was renamed \\"Ghost Security Group.\\" The group states that alerting governmental counterterrorist organizations stopped a potential attack in 2015 in Times Square and another in Tunisia. Of GSG's role in preventing these incidents, Abdallat said: \\"I want to tell you, I got goosebumps that day. It was like my joy [from it was] more than delivering a baby to this world. I felt this more intensely.\\" She has also said that she only desires to use her hacktivism against terrorist organizations: \\"We would only ever hack in a humanitarian way. We would never use it in a way to disturb normal individuals or governments.\\" Abdallat is the only member of Ghost Security Group whose identity is public, and according to articles published in 2015, is its only Muslim member. Her goals seem to be both to save lives and to provide the world with another view of Islam. She stated in an interview with Mic: \\"Islam is a peaceful religion.

He was a brother of George Kistiakowsky. His contributions to ornithology included ideas on navigation by migrating birds, the mechanics of bird flight, and the publication of several regional avifaunas. Alexander was born in Hatki, Poltava. Alexander's father Bogdan was a lawyer, philosopher, sociologist, and a professor at the University of Kiev. Bogdan's father, Alexander, was also a renowned professor of Criminal Law at the University of Kiev. A leftist revolutionary, Bogdan died in 1920. Alexander had three siblings, one died in Poland, while two others became scientists. George fled to Germany and influenced by his uncle (Vladimir Kistiakowsky, a pioneer in electrochemistry), studied physics and chemistry. He moved to the US in 1926 and joined Harvard University, heading a department in the Los Alamos atomic laboratory from 1944 to 1945. At the age of fifteen, he became interested in birds and insects and worked as an assistant at the Zoological Museum of the Kiev Academy of Sciences. In the 1920s he travelled on several natural history expeditions and lived in the richly furnished apartment of his parents. He worked at the museum and studied the Mallophaga. He then worked on biological pest control. In 1941, he was drafted into the Second Ukrainian Front. He was posted in a unit to defend a bridge but this was destroyed by the Germans. He received several military awards and later learned that this bridge in the south was deliberately made a target for the Germans while a bridge in the north was used by the Soviets to liberate Kiev. He returned from the war to continue research at the University of Kiev in 1946. Discovering that his wife had, during the war, sold off his parent's apartment including antique paintings to Germans, along with loss of his manuscripts, he divorced her. He later married an assistant at the university and they lived in a small apartment. He became a lecturer, was promoted to professor in 1961 and shortly after became head of the zoology department in the Shevchenko University, Kiev. A Ukrainian patriot, he was not in support of the communist government of the time and therefore did not find favour within the higher ranks of the university or government. In the 1960s the USSR under Nikita Khruschev was in diplomatic talks with the United States of America and a delegation of American scholars including George Kistiakowsky were due to visit. George wished to meet his brother at his home in Kiev. The officials did not like the idea of his small apartment filled with books and Alexander was surprised to receive a letter allocating a large three-room apartment. After more than 40 years the brothers met. George then invited Alexander to the United States but the travel documents took long to obtain. After boarding a ship at Odessa, he was told that his documents were not in order and the KGB stopped him from travel, and believed that he was going to defect. Alexander subsequently swore never to travel abroad. In 1981, under Leonid Brezhnev, the travel restrictions were removed and Alexander visited his brother in the United States for three weeks during which time he was also able to meet the ornithologist Ernst Mayr. His wish was that after his death, his ashes be scattered into the river Dnieper. His friends found this a difficult proposal and achieved it by sprinkling ashes from the urn onto a big wreath and then placing the wreath in the river while the empty urn was buried in his grave.

Life and work He was the son of surgeon Thore Olovson and Lis-Marit Ouchterlony-Olovson and had two younger sisters, Lis-Thoril Olovson and Rajna Olovson. After studying at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm 1955‚Äì59, Olovson visited Florence and Rome before settling in Paris where he first occupied a studio in La Cit√© Universitaire thanks to a scholarship. From 1959 onwards he remained in Paris, renting studios in the 14th and 15th arrondissements, with the last being located at 64 rue Saint Charles. Olovson found his initial inspiration in the works of Fran√ßois Rude, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Carl Milles, and Auguste Rodin. He developed his personal style alongside his newfound mentors, sculptors Jean Carton, Gunnar Nilsson, Jean Ousouf and Paul Cornet. He exhibited, befriended and worked closely with them and other figurative non- academic sculptors of his generation such as Charles Auffret and Ren√© Babin, all with strong connections to the ‚ÄúGroupe des Neuf‚Äù, created in 1963 to defend and promote figurative sculpture. Olovson let human passions and the beauty of nature inspire and invigorate his work and produced over 200 original sculpture artworks and a large collection of lithographs, etchings and drawings up until his death in 2017. He participated in a large number of exhibitions in France, Sweden, USA and elsewhere. He signed all his works simply with ‚ÄúGudmar‚Äù.

The story is both a sinidam, in which a goblin appears and influences the narrative, and a mobangdam containing a warning to those who copy others with bad intentions.  History and Transmission  Dokkaebi bangmangi bears similarities to Bangi (ÊóÅ„êå Pangta), a tale recorded in the text Youyang zazu (ÈÖâÈôΩÈõú‰øé Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang), by Tang Dynasty scholar Duan Chengshi (ÊÆµÊàêÂºè). Bangi tells the tale of its eponymous protagonist, a good older brother who receives a club that grants wishes, and his evil younger brother, who is punished by having his nose pulled off. The plot featuring a good person in coming up against an evil antagonist was later continued in Heungbujeon (Ìù•Î∂ÄÏ†Ñ The Tale of Heungbu). A well-known folktale in Korea, Dokkaebi bangmangi is recorded in around 30 different versions in key oral folktale sourcebooks including Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Outlines of Korean Oral Literature).  Plot   Basic plot  A good woodcutter, on his way to cut wood, picked up some ginkgo nuts. He planned to give them in turn to his grandfather, his grandmother, his parents, his wife and his children, leaving the last ones for himself. Just then, it suddenly started raining, so the woodcutter took shelter in a log cabin. Inside, he found some goblins having a party. They were banging a club, drinking and eating, and the woodcutter, feeling hungry, took out the ginkgo nut he had just picked up and bit into it. The goblins were startled at the sound of his biting, and ran away. The woodcutter picked up their club, and became a rich man. When his neighbor, an evil woodcutter, heard what had happened, he tried to become rich himself, in exactly the same way. But, unlike the good woodcutter, he tried to eat all the ginkgo nuts he picked up. Then, the evil woodcutter went into the goblins‚Äô cabin and bit into a ginkgo nut. But when the goblins heard the sound this time, they gave the evil woodcutter a good beating, thinking he was the man who had tricked them.  Variations  The good and evil woodcutters are sometimes presented as brothers rather than neighbors. Meanwhile, different versions describe different punishments for the evil woodcutter at the hands of the goblins. These involving stretching out parts of his body: in some versions, he has his arms and legs stretched longer; in others, the object of lengthening is his penis, showing a partial departure from moral lessons towards the pursuit of entertainment.  Features and Significance  Dokkaebi bangmangi not only emphasizes morality by featuring an evil character in contrast with its good protagonist; it also highlights the latter‚Äôs filial piety. When the good woodcutter picks up the ginkgo nuts, he plans to give them, in turn, to his grandparents, then his parents, while the evil woodcutter tries to keep all his nuts for himself. This emphasis on good and filially pious deeds lends Dokkaebi bangmangi a didactic character. It also contains a negative perception of imitating others. While many Korean goblin tales describe the experiences of protagonists who meet goblins one-to-one, Dokkaebi bangmangi presents the goblins as a group, while clearly demonstrating their powers through the treasure that is their club. In this respect, Dokkaebi bangmangi can be considered a typical example of a goblin story narrated in a folktale style. It features vivid embodiments of goblins as imagined according to a folktale- based worldview.  Other  In addition to Dokkaebi bangmangi, the story Hokburi yeonggam (ÌòπÎ∂ÄÎ¶¨ ÏòÅÍ∞ê The Old Man with a Lump) also tells a story of a protagonist becoming rich after meeting a goblin. The latter tale shows similar narrative content to the former, describing how the protagonist, the old man, receives riches after giving his lump to a goblin, but how another old man with a lump, who tries to become rich himself by copying the first, actually ends up with a second lump. But while Dokkaebi bangmangi emphasizes the filial piety of its protagonist and describes him coming into possession of their club after watching their party, and without actually talking to them, the protagonist in Hokburi yeonggam talks with the goblin while receiving his treasure, and the story does not place strong emphasis on his personality. The term dokkaebi bangmangi (‚Äúgoblin‚Äôs club‚Äù) is widely used in Korea, and appears in Korean dictionaries with the definition ‚Äúa club that makes wishes come true.‚Äù  References  * ‚ÄúGaeam-euro eodeun dokkaebi bangmangi‚Äù (Í∞úÏïîÏúºÎ°ú ÏñªÏùÄ ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ Î∞©ÎßùÏù¥ The Goblins‚Äô Club Obtained with Hazelnuts), Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Outlines of Korean Oral Literature). * https://gubi.aks.ac.kr/web/VolView2_html5.asp?datacode=08_07_FOT_20150216_HID_SIS_0008 * ‚ÄúDokkaebi bangmangi‚Äù (ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ Î∞©ÎßùÏù¥ The Goblins‚Äô Club), Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Outlines of Korean Oral Literature). * https://gubi.aks.ac.kr/web/VolView1_html5.asp?ur10no=tsu_2300&ur20no;=Q_2300_2_06A * ‚ÄúDokkaebi bangmangi‚Äù (ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ Î∞©ÎßùÏù¥ The Goblins‚Äô Club), Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Outlines of Korean Oral Literature). * https://gubi.aks.ac.kr/web/VolView2_html5.asp?datacode=07_12_FOT_20100205_HJJ_LJH_0001  References  Category:Korean folklore ","title":"Dokkaebi bangmangi"},{"id":"62397562","text":"Governor Oxenden may refer to: *George Oxenden (governor) (1620‚Äì1669), 1st Governor of the Bombay Presidency *Sir Henry Oxenden, 3rd Baronet (1645‚Äì1709), English Deputy-Governor of Bombay of East India Company from 1677 to 1681 ","title":"Governor Oxenden"},{"id":"62397582","text":"A & F Harvey Brothers, first Spinning Cotton Mill, established by Scottish brothers Andrew Harvey and Frank Harvey, in the year 1880.

Various names for the protagonist include banjjogi, oejjogi and oejjagi.  History and Transmission  This tale is not found in documentary records of stories pre-dating Korea‚Äôs late-19th-century Enlightenment Period. Today, the earliest known woodblock- printed edition of the story is Banjjok saram (Î∞òÏ™Ω ÏÇ¨Îûå The Half Person), which appears in Sim Ui-rin‚Äôs 1926 work Joseon donghwa daejip (Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÎèôÌôîÎåÄÏßë Grand Collection of Korean Children‚Äôs Stories). The first versions to clearly indicate dates and places of recording are those found in Im Seok-jae‚Äôs Hanguk gujeon seolhwa (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨Ï†ÑÏÑ§Ìôî Orally Transmitted Tales from Korea), collected in Pyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeonggi provinces between 1927 and 1934. Approximately 16 versions have been collected and reported in the form of orally transmitted stories gathered through field studies, including those in Hanguk gubi munhak daegye [ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Outlines of Korean Oral Literature] and historical records of local districts.  Plot   Basic plot  A husband and wife were trying hard to conceive a child. One day, a monk came and the wife made a donation to him. The monk gave her three cucumbers, saying that if she ate them she would have three sons. She ate two of the cucumbers, then shared the third one with her husband. The wife later gave birth to three children, but the youngest was born with only half a body. Their father, who was a hunter, was killed by a tiger while hunting. At this, the three boys went out to hunt the tiger and avenge their father, despite their mother‚Äôs protests. Banjjogi tried to go with his older brothers, but they tied him to a tree and left him behind. Banjjogi pulled up the tree to which he was tied, took it home, and told his mother that his brothers had told him to do so. Next time, his brothers tied him to a rock. But Banjjogi carried the rock home, too. Eventually, all three brothers went off hunting together. When they reached the beginning of the gorge where the tiger lived, they stopped for the night at the home of an old woman known as Patjuk. Patjuk told them that the tiger caught and ate hunters by transforming into a woman. She also told the boys how they could catch the tiger. Banjjogi did as she had instructed, catching the tiger, recovering his father‚Äôs remains and bringing them back along with the tiger‚Äôs skin. Then, the old woman told him that his mother was going to be eaten by a tiger, so he packed his belongs and set off again. He caught the tiger and saved his mother‚Äôs life. Meanwhile, the tiger skin caught the eye of the rich man who lived down the road. He made a bet with Banjjogi: If Banjjogi could make off with the rich man‚Äôs daughter, the rich man would let him marry her. If he failed, he would have to give the rich man the tiger skin. The rich man then rounded up all the villagers and made them guard his house. But Banjjogi stole his way into the rich man‚Äôs house, hung the man guarding the house to the doorframe by his topknot, painted sulfur on the rich man‚Äôs beard, and put a drumstick in the man‚Äôs wife‚Äôs hand. Then he put the man‚Äôs daughter on his back and set off again, shouting. Everyone was taken by surprise and chaos ensued. The rich man‚Äôs beard caught fire. Banjjogi married the rich man‚Äôs daughter and went on to prosper.  Variations  The key elements of Banjjogi are the protagonist‚Äôs extraordinary birth, the bullying he suffers from his brothers, the extermination of tigers, his bet with the rich man, and his marriage. Some versions of the story omit birth-related motifs or tiger extermination. In some cases, Banjjogi kills tigers by way of a bet; in others, his main achievement is not killing tigers but saving his brothers. Some versions of the story end with Banjjogi becoming a rich man by hunting tigers, while others end with him getting married. The food eaten by Banjjogi‚Äôs mother in order to conceive her children varies from version to version, with examples including daikon radishes, cucumbers, fish, peaches and nuts.  Features and Significance  The core element in the tale of Banjjogi is the strange birth of its protagonist with the physical characteristic of having only half a body. And the way he eliminates obstacles through his own strength and cunning, in spite of his physical limitations and the unkindness and scorn of those around him makes Banjjogi a typical folktale character. Meanwhile, his extraordinary birth and superhuman abilities are both transcendental, extraordinary qualities that allow Banjjogi to be understood as a mythical character. Some interpret Banjjogi‚Äôs incomplete body as a caricature of the abilities of a divine being, making it a modification of the motif of his extraordinary birth. The tale of Banjjogi generally proceeds through four narrative stages. First, Banjjogi‚Äôs mother eats food that makes her conceive him, then gives birth to him. In the second stage, Banjjogi is bullied by his brothers because of his physical deficiencies. In stage three, he uses his own strength to overcome his brothers‚Äô scorn, hunt the tiger, and prospers. In the fourth and final stage, Banjjogi wins the bet about making off with the rich man‚Äôs daughter, and marries her. Various versions show differences in narrative composition. Some include illustrations of formidable archery skills, similar to elements found in Kkul gangaji (ÍøÄ Í∞ïÏïÑÏßÄ Honey Dog), Agi jangsu seolhwa (ÏïÑÍ∏∞Ïû•ÏàòÏÑ§Ìôî The Tale of the Young General), and the stories of Jumong and King Yuri. Frequent story modification is thus among the narrative characteristics of the tale of Banjjogi, making it culturally significant for the insights it offers into the formation process of folktales.  Other  Stories of characters with only half a body are found across the world in places including North America, northeastern Siberia, Africa, Indonesia and Arab regions. China‚Äôs Shan hai jing (Â±±Êµ∑Á∂ì Classic of Mountains and Seas) contains a record of people who walk around on a crooked knee and bent foot, having only one arm and one leg, while India‚Äôs Mahabharata, too, contains the story of prince Jarasandha, about two queens in the kingdom of Magadha who shared a mango and then both gave birth to half-sons. Banjjogi has become established as a leading children‚Äôs book, with several dozen versions published in formats including storybooks, picture books and fairy tales.Kim, Bo-mi, ‚ÄúGyeolpip kaerikteo-ui kontencheu hwaryong bangan: Banjjoki seolhwa- reul jungsim-euro‚Äù (Í≤∞Ìïç Ï∫êÎ¶≠ÌÑ∞Ïùò ÏΩòÌÖêÏ∏† ÌôúÏö© Î∞©Ïïà : Î∞òÏ™ΩÏù¥ ÏÑ§ÌôîÎ•º Ï§ëÏã¨ÏúºÎ°ú Ways of Using Content about Characters with Deficiencies: A Study Focusing on the Tale of Banjjogi), Master‚Äôs Thesis, Hanyang University, 2015.

It is situated southwest of Lytton, and its nearest higher peak is Kumkan Peak, to the west. The mountain was named in association with Kwoiek Creek, Kwoiek Lake, and Kwoiek Peak. Kwoiek is a Thompson Indian word meaning \\"gouged out,\\" referring to a large chunk missing from the canyon wall. The name was officially adopted on October 6, 1936, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Meltwater from unnamed glaciers on its north slopes and precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Kwoiek Creek and Log Creek, both tributaries of the Fraser River. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Kwoiek Needle is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Kwoiek Needle.

One of the most stalwart players to have ever worn the yellow jersey, Ikhmal is a regular for the Wasps in all age categories. Club career As a youngster, Ikhmal made appearances for the Brunei Youth Team in the Premier League II in 2011. Afterwards he joined MS ABDB, the football team of his then-employer, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. He debuted with the team at the September 2012 Brunei Darussalam National Games and won gold, scoring the winner against Brunei-Muara district in the semi-final. MS ABDB also won the 2012 Brunei FA Cup that December but Ikhmal was not in the matchday squad. Ikhmal played in the first ever game of the Brunei Super League, a 2‚Äì1 victory against MS PDB on 14 December 2012. He made six further league appearances that season, finishing in second place and losing out to Indera FC via goal difference. After taking a sabbatical from the 2014 Brunei Super League, Ikhmal reappeared for the army's National Games squad and won his second gold medal in the football category. Ikhmal played in the final of the 2014-15 Brunei FA Cup on 4 January 2015 and was victorious on the night with a 2‚Äì0 scoreline over Najip FC. Although he was registered with MS ABDB for the 2015 season, his commitments for the national team restricted his playing time and by the second half of the season he transferred to defending champions Indera SC. Ikhmal's new team eventually finished second in the league, then competed against the new champions MS ABDB in the final of the 2015 FA Cup. Ikhmal started the match and scored in injury time against his former team but it was scant consolation as the Armymen won 3‚Äì2 in the end. Ikhmal received a third FA Cup winner's medal after Indera's 2‚Äì0 win over MS PDB in the final of the 2017-18 FA Cup on 1 April 2018. International career Ikhmal has represented Brunei since 2010 when he was sent to South Korea for the 38th Asian Schools Football Championship (which ultimately Brunei could not participate after their arrival due to the country's suspension from FIFA).http://www.footjuniors.com/Tournois/Asean/PHOTOLARGE/Asean2010_Brunei_1.JPG He was in contention for a place in the team for the December 2013 SEA Games held in Myanmar and featured in a friendly against Indonesia U23 the previous August, but was not selected. Ikhmal became an integral player for the under-23s in 2015, featuring in all three games at the 2016 AFC U-23 Championship qualifying held in Indonesia in March. Two months later, he departed to Singapore with the same squad for the 28th SEA Games. He played in four out of 5 games as Brunei lost every fixture in the football category. Ikhmal was called up to the senior squad for the 2016 AFF Championship qualification matches on October in Cambodia, as well as the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup in Malaysia the following month. He made his international debut in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Timor-Leste on 15 October. He also started against Cambodia three days later but this time the hosts rant out as 0‚Äì3 victors. Picking up an injury in that game, he then made only one substitute appearance at the inaugural Solidarity Cup, with the Wasps finishing fourth at the end of the AFC-sanctioned tournament. The following year, Ikhmal joined up with the national team under Stephen Ng Heng Seng for the 2017 Aceh World Solidarity Tsunami Cup. The charity meet was initially billed as a FIFA 'A'-international standard tournament before being changed to an under-23 tournament. After defeats against hosts Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan, Brunei's final game against Mongolia was cancelled due to bad weather. Ikhmal was selected for the 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy as one of the three overage players allowed for the under-21 tournament, along with Yura Indera Putera Yunos and Razimie Ramlli. Ikhmal played all three group matches but only clocked 180 minutes - he was a second-half substitute in the first game and was taken off after half time in the last game. Ikhmal accepted a callup by the national team for the two- legged 2022 World Cup qualification matches against Mongolia in June 2019. He did not see playing time as Robbie Servais preferred Yura Indera Putera Yunos and Shah Razen Said in the central midfield roles. Later that year Ikhmal was selected as one of two overage players in the Brunei under-22 squad for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.

It is the story of a Korean woman who produces loud destructive farts. When one fart severely damages her husband's house, his family throws her out. However, her flatulence later proves beneficial to the family and she is welcomed back..  History and transmission  Banggwijaengi myeoneuri is recorded in almost 100 different versions in key oral tale collections including Hanguk gubi munhak daegye [ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Outlines of Korean Oral Literature]. It is told throughout the Korean Peninsula.  Plot   Basic plot  In a household long ago, the daughter-in-law looked sick and was growing thinner. When her in-laws got worried asked her what was wrong, she answered that it was because she could not fart. When they heard this, her mother- and father-in-law told her not to worry and urged her to fart freely. The daughter-in-law answered that her farts were extremely powerful. She urged the family to prepare thoroughly, telling her father-in- law to hold on to a column, her mother-in-law to the door, her husband to the kitchen door, and her sister-in-law to the rice pot. When she farted, it was so powerful that the house was badly damaged, with some parts flying off and other parts collapsing. When they saw the strength of her fart, her parents- in-law decided to send her back to her original family. She followed her father-in-law back there. On the way, they met a peddler. The daughter-in-law made a bet with him that she could pick some fruit from a tree. She got the fruit down by doing an enormous fart and received a good item from the peddler in return. When he saw this, her father-in-law realized that his daughter-in- law‚Äôs farts were useful and took her back to his house.  Variations  Variations on Banggwijaengi myeoneuri are broadly as follows. First are those variations where the story finishes when the daughter-in-law does a huge fart. Second are variations in which the fart blows away either just the parents-in- law or the parents-in-law and the husband, widowing the protagonist. Third are variations in which the story ends with the daughter-in-law being kicked out by her in-laws for farting. Fourthly are variations in which, instead of meeting a peddler on the way back to her blood family, the daughter-in-law farts to knock down some pears or daechu (jujubes) from high up in a tree for her father-in-law after he expresses a desire to eat them, then returns to her husband‚Äôs home. Finally, the wares sold by the peddler differ in some versions, with variations including brassware, silk, hemp cloth, sundriesThe Korean term used here is hwanga jangsu, a Joseon term for a peddler selling various wares. Yu, Seung-mu, ‚ÄúHwanga jangsu‚Äù (Ìô©ÏïÑÏû•Ïàò Hwanga jangsu), in Encyclopedia of Korean Culture (ÌïúÍµ≠ÎØºÏ°±Î¨∏ÌôîÎåÄÎ∞±Í≥ºÏÇ¨Ï†Ñ), http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0065234 or wooden bowls.  Features and significance  Banggwijaengi myeoneuri is a folk tale but has mythical qualities. Firstly, the daughter-in-law, with farts powerful enough to send houses and people flying and strip fruit from high branches, resembles a female giant in a myth. The resounding farts she emits can be seen as an inheritance from excremental motifs in giant tales; among the various types of excretion, farting is one that induces particular mirth. Moreover, the way the daughter-in-law is expelled from her in-laws‚Äô home before returning again can be seen as a kind of ‚Äúrite of passage‚Äù whereby a daughter-in-law gains the acceptance of her husband‚Äôs family.  Other  Banggwijaengi myeoneuri is a type of ‚Äúfarter tale.‚Äù Such comedic tales include not only Banggwijaengi myeoneuri, with its flatulent daughter-in-law protagonist, but various other stories including those about competitions among farters, and those in which thieves are chased away by farts.

She wrote an article for Circle and Square, entitled \\"A Profession of Faith.\\" In 1938 she illustrated the book ‚ÄúVoces de Oriente‚Äù, prose translation by Khalil Gibr√°n, made by Leila Neffa. Her first individual exhibition took place in 1939 at Amigos del Arte in Montevideo. Torres Garc√≠a wrote a prologue for the catalog entitled \\"Rosa Acle y Constructivismo\\", there he expressed that she was a student endowed and committed to the highest level of discipline and ethical standard, qualities necessary for the development of a deep intellectual search. He also stressed that she was a promoter of Constructivism. He also asserted that her paintings reminded him of ‚ÄúPersian and ancient Chaldean art.\\" Stating that, ‚Äúthis feature that undoubtedly is of ancestral origin; a certain orientalism that approaches us to the ancient Persian art or to the warming of Ur or another related current in the ancient art, and that Rosa Acle gives with the most free and natural spontaneity. Torres-Garc√≠a's words testify to Rosa Acle's precocity and the \\"astonishment\\" that caused \\"her rapid assimilation and understanding of the doctrine, as well as the rules derived from it.  Europe and Australia  Her father, Tufic Acle, was a prosperous and conservative businessman who had difficulty controlling his independent and talented daughter. Prejudices in the family and social environment of the 30s and 40s, would remove the artist from the AAC. Acle left for Paris with letters of introduction to Torres- Garc√≠a's old friends Julio Gonzalez, Wassily Kandinsky, Jacques Lipchitz, and Pablo Picasso. This was also the time that she became involved with a group of Hindus discovering Hatha Yoga, a practice she pursued for the rest of her life. In that same year Rosa Acle visited Italy, Switzerland, Egypt, Java and arrived in Australia just as World War II broke out. For eight years she would reside in Australia. She settled in Melbourne until the end of the war, painted intensely during the first years, and corresponded with her teacher Torres-Garc√≠a. She married and had two sons. As with so many women artists, marriage, motherhood, and the vicissitudes of life became the priority. In a letter to Lipchitz, with whom she continued to correspond, she confided ‚Äúseeking to be a good wife and mother, I relegated all my aesthetic concerns to my subconscious. In the love for my husband, I looked for succor and meaning to the moral and religious preoccupations that always tortured me.‚Äù She returned to Montevideo in 1947 having left all of her Australian work behind, which she never managed to recover and, unfortunately, the majority of her early AAC paintings, drawings, and sculptures that had been left in Montevideo had been discarded and lost. Very few pieces of her earlier works remain. Although she visited her former teacher, Joaquin Torres-Garcia, and continued to work in Constructivist style for many years, Acle never joined his famous workshop, El Taller.  Later career  After divorce and the death of her old teacher, Torres- Garc√≠a, she resumed painting with intensity. In 1956 she married again and from this second marriage a daughter was born. From 1950 her work was characterized by an imaginary element of classical iconography, Hindu philosophy, oriental decoration and Torresgarcian constructivism converged. In the search for a truth, she becomes a member of the Rosicrucians, attracted by the mystical aspect, which emerges in many of her paintings. Already installed in Montevideo and urged by economic urgency she devoted herself to teaching yoga for 30 years. Acle‚Äôs work incorporates classical, religious, and indigenous iconography into complex, highly structured architectural compositions. Her work has never been widely exhibited, but it is highly regarded.

It has been placed in a new genus, Electrovermis. This parasite infects the lesser electric ray (Narcine bancroftii). Once it successfully invades the host, it migrates to and dwells in the lumen of the heart of the ray. Like other blood flukes, it thrives by feeding off of the blood of its host. The adults are morphologically and physiologically similar to other blood flukes that infect rays such as Orchispirium heterovitellatum. Unlike many other blood flukes that infect molluscs as an intermediate host, E. zappum infects bivalves such as clams. Both the rays and clams densely populate warm, shallow intertidal marine waters, which provide the parasite an opportunistic environment to carry out its life cycle stages.  Life cycle  The general life cycle of the blood fluke, Electrovermis zappum, consists of a mollusc or polychaete intermediate host, and a fish definitive host. The life cycle of the Electrovermis zappum begins with the eggs being laid into the lesser electric ray, and then migrate out as miracidia, and infects the coquina clam intermediate host. This is where the blood fluke then undergoes asexual reporduction. The miracidia then turn into sporocysts, and within the sporocysts contain cercariae, which are then released into the water. When it penetrates the electric ray it then loses it tail and becomes a schistosomulum, similar to the life cycle of other schistosomes. Since both the lesser electric ray and where the cercariae are released is near the swash zone of the beach it can easily transmit and infect the ray. It then infects the heart lumen of the lesser electric ray at any age, and continues the life cycle.  Anatomy  The general anatomical structure of the species was discovered. The body was found to be extremely elongate, dorsoventrally flattened and has anterior end tapering. The posterior end is bluntly rounded and lacking lateral tubercles. The nervous system is indistinct. The anterior suckle is aspinous and is lacking the peduncle and is unusually small. The pharynx of this parasite is absent in its structure. The intestine also has a U shape in the anatomical structure. Posterior oesphageal swelling is also present. The cirrus is long and is 65% of seminal vesicle length. The testis is seen to be single, medial, looped, lacking lobed marginal and is found posterior to the intestine. The post ovary space comprises 1/3rd the body length. The uterus post-gonadal is found dorsal to posterior-most end of the seminal vehicle. The uterine eggs are found to be very large and occupy 67% of the uterus. The eggs are oblong and vacuous.

It is sometimes classified as a formula tale by those focusing on its structure of repeating and accumulating success on the part of the protagonist.  History and Transmission  The first recorded version of Saekki seo bal was Geeureumbaengi sanae-ui bok (Í≤åÏúºÎ¶ÑÎ±ÖÏù¥ ÏÇ¨ÎÇ¥Ïùò Î≥µ The Luck of the Lazy Boy), a traditional fairy tale serialized by Song Geum-seon in the 1930s in Japanese in the Gyeongseong Ilbo (Í≤ΩÏÑ±ÏùºÎ≥¥ Seoul Daily). A later version, with no clear date or location marked, was collected by Im Seok-jae in 1943 in Hongseong, Chungcheongnam-do Province and published in Volume 6 of Hanguk gujeon seolhwa (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨Ï†ÑÏÑ§Ìôî Korean Oral Tales) in the 1990s. More than 20 different versions are found in anthologies including Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Outlines of Korean Oral Literature).  Plot   Basic plot  Long ago, there lived a woman and her lazy son. The mother gave the son three pieces of rice straw rope and kicked him out. A pot seller he met on the road offered to swap a pot for some straw rope, which he needed. So the son gave away the rope and received a pot. After setting off again, he met a young woman who had broken her pot, so he swapped his pot for a mal (Îßê; a unit of measurement) of rice from her. At a house where he stopped for the night, a mouse ate all his rice, so he took the mouse with him instead. At another house a cat ate his mouse, so he took the cat instead. At another house, a horse trod on his cat and killed it, so the horse‚Äôs owners gave him the horse. He came across someone burying a dead young woman, so he swapped the horse for her corpse. At one place, a pretty young woman pushed the corpse over. The boy scolded her, saying she had killed a healthy woman, and was given the pretty young woman instead. On the road again, they met a rich man. Lusting after the young woman, the rich man proposed a bet with the boy. They decided to bet on solving a riddle. The boy asked, ‚ÄúWho swapped some rice straw rope for a pot, a pot for some rice, some rice for a mouse, a mouse for a cat, a cat for a horse, a horse for a dead woman, and a dead woman for a live woman?‚Äù The rich man was unable to answer, so the boy took all his money, and the young woman, returned home and went on to live a good life.  Variations  Some versions make the protagonist an aristocrat on his way to take the civil service examination, like Jopssal han al-lo jeongseung-ui sawi (Ï¢ÅÏåÄ Ìïú ÏïåÎ°ú Ï†ïÏäπÏùò ÏÇ¨ÏúÑ Marrying the Minister‚Äôs Daughter with One Grain of Millet), or a farmhand, rather than a lazy boy. Some forms, such as Dwiju jigo gandaji (Îí§Ï£º ÏßÄÍ≥† Í∞ÑÎã§ÏßÄ Carrying Off the Rice Chest) are almost identical to Saekki seo bal in their first half, but then show the protagonist losing what he has received at the end of the story, when the young woman changes into bean curd. In other cases, the source of the boy‚Äôs success is not three pieces of rice straw rope but a grain that he grows himself, such as millet, as in Jo isak-euro seonggonghan sanae (Ï°∞ Ïù¥ÏÇ≠ÏúºÎ°ú ÏÑ±Í≥µÌïú ÏÇ¨ÎÇ¥ The Man Who Achieved Success with an Ear of Millet), or sesame; in still other cases the boy succeeds not by swapping items but through successfully growing his own crop of grain.  Features and Significance  This story proceeds with the protagonist swapping a series of items for increasingly bigger, more valuable things: three pieces of rice straw rope - pot - rice - mouse - cat - horse - dead woman - live woman - the possessions of a rich man. In versions that feature grains such as millet or rice instead of straw rope, the order of trading is as follows: one ear of millet - mouse - cat - horse - bull - government minister‚Äôs daughter. When the focus is put on this structure of repetition, this tale is sometime classified as a ‚Äúformula tale.‚Äù Formula tales emphasize a certain form, or ‚Äúframework,‚Äù showing accumulation or repetition through a series of connections. In Saekki seo bal, a lazy boy achieves great success through surprising resourcefulness. The way the son leaves home and achieves success by swapping items can be seen as a coming-of-age tale showing a weak, helpless son becoming independent from his mother. The protagonist gains wealth through all his exchanges but deceives innocent people in the process; this, in reality, is unacceptable behavior. But as a fictional tale it has meaning in the way it shows a weak character using extraordinary resourcefulness to beat a powerful one and become successful. This feature shows itself most clearly in the final scene, in which the boy tricks the greedy rich man. In sum, this tale can be seen as the simple and primitive thoughts of common people contained in a form of accumulation and repetition.  Other  A similar tale to this one is found in India‚Äôs JƒÅtaka, thought to date from the third or fourth century CE, indicating that this is a very old story. It is found all over the world, too. ‚ÄúThe Profitable Exchange,‚Äù No. 1655 in Stith Thompson‚Äôs book The Types of Folktale, has the same form, as does Japan‚Äôs Warashibe ch≈çja („Çè„Çâ„Åó„ÅπÈï∑ËÄÖ Straw Millionaire). One Philippine tale features a monkey as its protagonist and takes the form of an animal tale with an unusual structure involving some narrative elements in which the monkey gradually sees more profit from its trades, and others in which it makes gradual losses.

She and Yu Feng were China's first female cartoonists. Born in Shanghai, she worked in Singapore and the Philippines, and was a member of the avant-garde . She had a three-year extramarital relationship with the artist Ye Qianyu, but left him to marry an air force pilot. She moved to Taiwan after the Chinese Communist Revolution, and later died by suicide.  Early life and career  Liang was born in 1911 into a middle-class family in Shanghai, with her ancestral home in Zhongshan, Guangdong. She studied at Hangzhou National College of Art (now China Academy of Art) and then at the Western Art Department of Shanghai Xinhua Art College, where she focused on oil painting. She was a friend of the revolutionary poet Yin Fu (Bai Mang). In 1930, she drew nine illustrations for his poem collection Children Tower (Â≠©ÂÑøÂ°î). However, the book was not published at the time as Yin Fu was executed by the Kuomintang in early 1931 along with four others, together known as the Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers. Liang was a member of the avant-garde Storm Society, founded in 1931 by Pang Xunqin and Ni Yide. She used the pen name Bomb. Although she later dropped it at the exhortation of her friends, she adopted Bon instead, \\"to preserve the sound of an explosion\\". Individualistic and adventuresome by nature, she went to Singapore and then the Philippines, where she taught fine art at a Chinese middle school.  Affair with Ye Qianyu and Miss Bee  Liang returned to Shanghai in early 1935. When submitting her cartoon at Time Book Company, she met Ye Qianyu, a prominent artist and editor, and instantly fell in love with him. According to Ye's memoir, she pursued him without caring about the fact that he was married with children, in the spirit of the romanticism of the 1930s. In the spring of 1935, Liang and Ye participated in a sanitation propaganda project organized by the Tianjin‚ÄìPukou railway. They travelled to Beijing by train, where they stayed for a few days, and then decided to go into hiding in Nanjing. Living secretly with Ye, she drew the comic strip, Miss Bee (ËúúËúÇÂ∞èÂßê), which was published on the front page of the newspaper Libao (Á´ãÊä•; Standing Paper). The strip was only published for 25 days, however, before Ye's wife Luo Caiyun and her father tracked him down and forced him to return to Shanghai. Luo refused Ye's request for divorce, but the couple became legally separated. In November 1935, Liang drew cartoons of the marriage of the \\"Movie Queen\\" Hu Die. In 1936, she was elected as one of the 31 members of the Arranging Committee of the First National Cartoon Exhibition. When Japan invaded China and occupied Shanghai in 1937, Ye Qianyu, together with a group of fellow Shanghai cartoonists, formed the \\"National Salvation Cartoon Propaganda Corps\\". Funded by the Kuomintang government, the corps left Shanghai for the interior to spread anti-Japanese propaganda. Liang was the only female member of the corps. The propaganda corps evacuated Shanghai and went to Wuhan. There she created a cartoon depicting a guerrilla fighter standing as a giant in front of the Japanese Army, which is considered her representative work in war propaganda. She also created the work Women Joining the War, which was exhibited in the Soviet Union. In 1938, Liang met Chen Enjie (ÈôàÊÅ©Êù∞), a pilot of the Republic of China Air Force, and fell in love with him on the spot. She terminated her three-year affair with Ye and later married Chen. She travelled to Tibet during the war.  Later life and death  After the surrender of Japan, Liang returned to Shanghai in 1946 and travelled to Xinjiang to paint. When the Communist Party took over mainland China, she moved to Taiwan with her husband, and had a son. In Taiwan, she reconnected with Liao Molin (ÂªñÊú´Êûó), another former member of the National Salvation Cartoon Propaganda Corps, and worked at a kiln Liao opened in Tainan. She later met the writer Lin Haiyin, who introduced her to work as an illustrator for the newspaper United Daily News. However, she did not find career success in Taiwan and suffered from schizophrenia. She died by suicide in Taiwan, circa 1970.  Legacy  Liang is known as China's first female cartoonist, although Yu Feng was her contemporary and possible predecessor. Her known works are few but are praised for their high quality. Her short- lived comic strip, Miss Bee, is described by a critic as \\"very lovely; the lines were soft and beautiful, and the themes were very interesting. It drew much attention from other cartoonists and was welcomed by readers from the beginning.\\" In Ye Qianyu's memoir, he recalled his three years spent with Liang fondly, and described her as a \\"talented painter\\". He said that she had a \\"poet's temperament\\" and that he drew much inspiration from her when creating his own works such as the comic strip Mr. Wang.

Storylines Alexander Hammerstone defended the MLW National Openweight Championship in a Star Sprangled Hammer Challenge at Kings of Colosseum. Jacob Fatu won the MLW World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Kings of Colosseum. The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion. At Intimidation Games, Tom Lawlor successfully defended the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Low Ki in a steel cage match and then Lawlor's former Team Filthy teammate Simon Gotch joined forces with the team of newcomers Jacob Fatu and Josef Samael to attack Lawlor after the match and formed a faction known as Contra Unit. At Battle Riot II, Contra Unit attacked Lawlor again during an interview after his successful title defense against Jimmy Havoc. On the April 20 episode of Fusion, Lawlor challenged Contra Unit to a match. Contra Unit attacked Lawlor again on numerous occasions throughout the next few weeks.

Main event match In the main event, Tom Lawlor defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Contra Unit member Jacob Fatu. Near the end of the match, Lawlor avoided a moonsault by Fatu and hit him with some strikes but Fatu superkicked Lawlor and then nailed a pop-up Samoan drop and a double jump moonsault to pin him to win the World Heavyweight Championship. Aftermath Dynasty received their title shot against Hart Foundation in a ladder match for the World Tag Team Championship on the July 13 episode of Fusion, which Dynasty won. Tom Lawlor received his rematch for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Jacob Fatu on the August 31 episode of Fusion, where Fatu retained the title with the help of his Contra Unit teammates and then Lawlor was assaulted by Contra Unit after the match until Low Ki and The Von Erichs (Ross Von Erich and Marshall Von Erich) made the save for Lawlor.

It is preserved in four manuscripts, though some are fragmentary. It is a sequel to the Chanson de Roland, and is set against the background of the Reconquista of Spain. It was written between 1230 and 1250, and consists of about 11000 rhymed decasyllables. A prose version of the tale is preserved in a manuscript of the late fifteenth century, with the title La cronique associ√©e de Charlemaine tr√®s loable et Anseis icy couppl√©e. The first printed edition of the chanson is that of Johann Alton in 1892.  Sources  A complete manuscript of the chanson is held by the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, under reference fr. 1598; another manuscript, dating from 1280‚Äì1300, is held under reference fr. 793. In the twentieth century, two manuscript parchment bifolia of the chanson were found in Italy, where in the early years of the seventeenth century they had been used as bindings for other documents; these, with many other mediaeval manuscripts, are believed to have originated in the libraries of the d'Este family, which shortly before had moved its court from Ferrara to Modena. One bifolium was discovered by Monica Longobardi in Imola, and is held in the Biblioteca Comunale, the municipal library of that town. The other was included in a group of documents later transferred from the Archivio Notarile di Bologna, a legal archive, to the Archivio di Stato or state archives of Bologna; it was described in 1931 by , who may have removed it from the archives at that time. It is now considered lost.  References   Further reading  *Vincenzo De Bartholomaeis (1931). Nuovi frammenti dell' (in Italian).

Persuasive speech is one of the three most daily used speeches (the other two types are an informative and a special occasion). Persuasive speech is used when presenters decide to convince their presentation or ideas to their listeners. Their goal is to convince or persuade people to believe in a certain point of view. Advertisement is one of the examples of persuasive speech. The sellers have a goal to convince buyers to buys their product. We also use a persuasive speech in debates and legal proceeding.  Ethics of persuasion  Persuasion itself has gotten a negative connotation. Most people, when they hear this word, will directly think that people are trying to change their perspectives and beliefs into their beliefs. However, this is not always true. Persuasive speech can be ethical in a way that the speaker itself seek to gather and analyze all angles of an idea. Moreover, the speaker will present their ideas in a way that helps people understand why their point of view is correct. Finally, the speaker will also provide a solution to the problem addressed.  The difference between persuasive speech and persuasive writing  There are three main differences between persuasive writing and persuasive speech. Firstly, the persuasive speech factor there is the use of body language also the speaker's voice to get the attention of the audience, and the good environment to give the speech. In persuasive writing, the factor is the writer should use the good argument, logical reason and make your readers agree with your thoughts through different research. Secondly, in persuasive speech audience attention is very important because it is the audience who has to explore the answer from the speaker, the audience should be convinced by their own perspectives and reasons it is not according to speaker reasons. In persuasive writing, the purpose of persuasive writing is to convince readers to share your opinion or take a particular action. Lastly, the persuasive speech's success is often measured by the audience's choice and willingness to hear and admire the speaker's argument. The success of persuasive writing is to ask rhetorical questions to make them think about or include a call to action, in which you ask the reader to do something.  The advantages and the disadvantages of persuasive speech  Advantages * It changes the opinion and provides more knowledge about a particular field. * It provides good feelings to the audience if the speech correlates with the necessity of that certain place. It gives positive hope for solving existing problems. * It gives opportunities to people to take a certain position to develop by convincing their plans, ideas, and visions.  Disadvantages * It can also offer false and fake interest by changing their perspective leading into the untruth knowledge. * It can take advantage of the week side and be bias towards them. * They may betray or their words just remain in their mouth after gaining their position as the audience supported them without studying their background.  The techniques of persuasive speech  The following are some techniques of persuasive speech: # Ethos: your materials and resources should be trustworthy, and convince people you are right. Also, in this aspect, your way of speaking also should engage the audience. # Logos: the way of showing that you have an organized speech or logical argument, is related to your sources. If you use unbiased, accurate resources, people will assume you have a very strong and logical argument. Also, you can use your personal experience or some well-known experiences to support your point. Basically, you do not only give an argument but have a full explanation and support your argues. # Pathos: This relates your emotional part, a good speaker should be able to stir the audience's feelings, let people agree with you. You use logical argument, but also use emotion strategy to appeal audience follow you. This skill will be effective if you want to audience change their behaviors or let them do some actions. # Cognitive dissonance: this strategy is to make people feel uncomfortable in your speech. From the psychology perspective saying that this will happen that if your topic will challenge the audience's values or beliefs. # Positive and negative motivation: this is the strategy to convince people that the good side of your speech and bad consequence of not accept it. # Appeals to need: your speech can relate to the audience's needs. There are several needs that human beings have: social needs, safety needs, self-esteem needs, self- actualization needs, and physiological needs. Just relate one of those needs in your speech that based on your audience, it will be effective.  The importance of persuasive speech  With the development of technology, persuasion is getting more and more important than before. There are five reasons for regard to the importance of persuasion. # Persuasive communication is extremely increasing; # Persuasive information spread very quickly; # Persuasion becomes more and more organized; # Persuasive communication is subtle and devious; # And persuasive communication is not simple but complicated now. By analyzing the importance of persuasive speech we can see that persuasive speech had become a common way of communication. Nowadays, people are using persuasive speech through out the time. For example, when a child want something from their parents they will automatically use a persuasive speech, and when a friend would like to invite their friends to go out they will also use a persuasive speech. Therefore, persuasive speech does not necessarily directed to the politicians, presidents or public speakers. It can be used by anyone in anytime. This is one of the reason why we should analyse the concept and method of persuasive speech. Persuasive speech is part of the area about persuasion, that's the reason why persuasive speech is important and we need to give attention to the persuasive speech, knowing the advantages and disadvantages of that and apply it not only into our classes but also into our daily lives.

One of his instructors in horsemanship was Menou de Charnizay, the friend and favourite pupil of Antoine de Pluvinel. He became Master of the Horse to the French Ambassador, negotiating the Peace of Westphalia at M√ºnster in 1645, and using the opportunity to learn about veterinary practices in Germany. On his return to Paris he joined the Royal Riding Academy. He is said also to have had a talent for music, for painting, and for making friends. Le Parfait Mareschal was in two volumes, the first on horse management and the second on equine diseases. The book showed familiarity with Greek and Latin writers on the subject. It also repeated extracts of Newcastle's book on horsemanship, on the grounds that Newcastle's book was hard to find and expensive.

Jak zatrzymaƒá antykulturƒô totalitarnych mniejszo≈õci) is a book by World War II historian Marek Jan Chodakiewicz. The book engendered controversy in July 2019 when the Institute of National Remembrance hosted Chodakiewicz for a talk about the book at the Warsaw Janusz Kurtyka IPN Educational Center.  Content  According to the book, the key to winning the culture war against LGBTs is to employ the language used by the LGBTs. The book advocates the use of \\"jester\\" (weso≈Çek) instead of \\"gay\\" (gej), \\"self-female\\" (autosamica) instead of \\"feminist\\", and \\"retreat\\" (odwrotek) instead of transgendered. Accusations of homophobia should be dismissed with the claim that heteronormal people are the victims of \\"heterophobia\\". According to Chodakiewicz, he \\"wrote this book because it is important for Poles to know what awaits them if they do not oppose the 'civilization of death.' I saw with my own eyes how LGBT, gender, and feminism emerged from the underground and was gradually embraced in American politics: introducing a new version of Marxism that I call Marxism-Lesbianism.\\" This statement was added to the description of the book at online bookstores.  Lecture about book  In July 2019, the book engendered controversy and propelled Chodakiewicz to fame when the Institute of National Remembrance hosted Chodakiewicz for a talk on the book at the Warsaw Janusz Kurtyka IPN Educational Center. Chodakiewicz, who usually resides in the United States, was on a trip to Poland to promote his book. The talk was moderated by Najwy≈ºszy Czas! editor Tomasz Sommer. In the talk, Chodakiewicz described the urban legend of \\"gerbilling\\" as factual. Chodakiewicz stated that in 1984 his ex-girlfriend Debbie, who was a registered nurse, extracted a hamster smeared in fat from the anus of a gay man. Chodakiewicz said that the claws and teeth of the hamster were removed prior to this episode. According to Chodakiewicz, \\"gerbilling\\" was a response to the AIDS epidemic. He made additional homophobic claims over the next. Contrasting lesbians to gays, Chodakiewicz said that lesbians are much \\"calmer\\" than gays, while gays in San Francisco, including Chodakiewicz's colleagues, have on average 350 sexual partners a year, with some even reaching 1,000 partners. Chodakiewicz also spoke on the \\"ideology of Marxism-lesbianism\\", contrasting \\"homosexual ideology\\" with Communism and Nazism, and saying they are a fifth column in Poland and receive cash from abroad. Historian S≈Çawomir Cenckiewicz said he was shocked at Chodakiewicz, in particular of the talk of \\"feces, sperm and blood\\" and homosexuals. Ma≈Çgorzata P. Bonikowska, editor-in-chief of Polish-Canadian newspaper Gazeta, writes that she does not recall anything as vulgar and repulsive as Chodakiewicz's lecture. The delivery of the talk at a publicly funded educational facility was controversial. The IPN, which initially declined to comment, eventually responded to queries saying that Prof. Chodakiewicz's views are not the official position of the IPN. According to the IPN, the purpose of the meeting was to discuss Chodakiewicz's latest book. Both Chodakiewicz and Sommer had collaborated with the IPN previously. Chodakiewicz also serves on the council of the Museum of the Second World War in Gda≈Ñsk; the museum did not respond to journalists' requests for comments.

Retrieved 20 November November 2019 The church was declared a listed building in 1984.  History  Apostelkirche (inside) The church marks the centre of the former church village, which was the nucleus of the later town of G√ºtersloh. Already around 800 a wooden chapel could have stood here. The first stone church dates from 1201. A few wall remains are still preserved in the tower of today's church, the rest burned down at the beginning of the 16th century. The special feature of the Apostle Church is its use as a simultaneous church between 1655 and 1890. The faithful of the majority Protestant church village and the northern and western building communities, which all belonged to the dominion of Rheda, shared the church with the Catholic faithful, who came from the southern and eastern building communities belonging to the prince bishopric of Osnabr√ºck. The Simultaneum only ended with the inauguration of the Catholic Church of St. Pankratius not far from the Old Church Square. Up to this time the present-day Apostle Church bore the name \\"St. Pankratius\\", so the Catholics took the name with them to their new building. The three-nave hall church was largely destroyed by bombs on the Sunday of Death in 1944, and several citizens who had sought shelter in it died. A painting by Heinz Beck showing the scenery of the destroyed church square can be seen in the church.Stefan Lind: Vom Scheitern eines Radikalen, Westfallen-Blatt, German. Retrieved 20 November 2019 The foundation stone for today's building was laid in 1951 according to plans by Werner March, who had also designed the Olympiastadion Berlin. A pointed arched, barrel vaulted hall church with approx. 400 seats was built. Four corner columns with late Romanesque leaf capitals from the destroyed choir were reused. In the tower hall there is a chandelier from 1743. At the back of the church a sculpture by the sculptor Willy Meller, created in 1955 and known for numerous works in the service of National Socialism, commemorates the victims of the Second World War.Evangelische Gemeinde, G√ºterloh.

It is provided by the World Bank, which raised the majority of the money by issuing $320m in bonds and $105m in swaps to private investors, which can be seen as a type of catastrophe bond. Additional funding was provided by approximately $190m in donations from three countries and the World Bank's International Development Association. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank at the time the bonds were issued, described the programme as \\"leveraging our capital market expertise to serve the world‚Äôs poorest people.\\"  Bonds  A total of $330m of bonds and swaps were sold to private investors in June 2017 with a maturity date of 15 July 2020, although it can be extended by one year. The bond pays annual interest at rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.1% above Libor. The interest paid is funded by the governments of Germany and Japan. The bonds were issued in two classes: Class A (of which $225m was issued) only applies to pandemic flu and coronavirus, and is subject to a higher threshold of deaths before money will be paid out, making it a lower risk. Class B ($95m issued) has a higher risk. The bonds are intended to transfer pandemic risk away from developing countries and reimburse them while an outbreak is taking place. This differs from traditional reinsurance, which pays out after an event has happened in order to replenish insurers' capital. It added to the complexity of designing and marketing the bonds, as investors had to be comfortable with the parametric triggers on which the pay-outs depended. When a qualifying pandemic occurs, the invested capital can be paid out to affected countries, rather being returned to investors. Among the parameters governing whether or not the bond is triggered are: the number of IBRD or IDA countries affected; the number of cases in each of those countries; the number of deaths; the percentage of confirmed cases to total cases, including suspected; and the growth rate of cases. The conditions to trigger the bond must be in place for at least 12 weeks after the designated start of the event for payouts to happen. After that, they must be in place on a rolling 12-week basis. On 17 April 2020, the first payout for the PEF bonds was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of nearly $196 million was paid out from the bonds and swaps, comprising 100% of Class B, and 16.67% of Class A - the maximum possible payout for a coronavirus outbreak. In 2019, the World Bank indicated that they were planning on continuing the PEF programme by issuing a new set of bonds, PEF 2.0, starting in May 2020.  Payouts  There are two \\"windows\\" of payouts which can be made by the PEF to countries or aid agencies in the case of a pandemic: the insurance window and the cash window.  Insurance window  The insurance window is backed by the bonds sold, and can pay out a total of $425 million. It has more stringent criteria required to trigger a payout than the cash window. The insurance window covers diseases caused by: * Pandemic flu (maximum payout $275m) * Filovirus (maximum payout $150m) * Coronavirus (maximum payout $195.83m) * Rift Valley fever, Lassa Fever, or Crimean‚ÄìCongo hemorrhagic fever (maximum payout $75m) With the exception of pandemic flu, payouts are layered, with a system of thresholds used to determine the amount payable.  Cash window  The cash window is a short term cash injection backed by donated funds. It is governed by a steering body of countries which contributed the donations. The cash window has a capacity to pay out up to $64m, although this may fluctuate based on the funds already issued and donations received. It provides coverage of all the pathogens covered by the insurance window, as well as new pathogens which are not already epidemically transmitted.  Criticism  The PEF has been widely criticised for providing generous returns to investors while making it too difficult to access funding during disease outbreaks, especially during the early stages of an outbreak when swift action is crucial. It was described by the former World Bank chief economist Lawrence Summers as \\"an embarrassing mistake\\". Critics argue that the money spent on the PEF could be better used for increasing surveillance, diagnostics, and response capabilities for outbreaks.  Kivu Ebola epidemic  During the Kivu Ebola epidemic, which resulted in over 2,000 deaths, the PEF had paid out only $31 million by the 13th month of the outbreak, while having paid a total of $75.5 million in premiums to bondholders. The conditions of bonds were not triggered by this outbreak, so investors did not lose any money; the money paid out by the PEF came from the donation component of the fund. The terms of the bonds were criticised because even the higher-risk Class B bonds required at least 20 deaths in a second country before money could be released ‚Äì a situation which is rare even in severe Ebola outbreaks due to the political geography of the areas of Africa prone to outbreaks of Ebola.  COVID-19 pandemic  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the PEF again came under criticism for having terms which were too stringent; the first tranche of money was not eligible to be released until 12 weeks after the start of the outbreak, despite the other conditions being satisfied, which prevented the money from being used to contain the disease during the crucial early stages. The payout conditions were triggered on 17 April 2020, nearly four months after the outbreak was first identified.

She is the founder of the Elena Barraquer Fundaci√≥n. She organises cataract fixing trips to Africa by her surgeons and teams. In 2012 she was recognized with the Medal of Honor of Barcelona and in 2018 she was recognized with the Queen Sophia Spanish Institute award in her category of Excellence Awards. Life Compte was born in Barcelona in 1954 into a family known for medical research. She was part of the fourth generation of ophthalmologists and her brother was expected to follow in the family business. Elena decided that she too wanted to become an eye surgeon even though it was not expected. Her father is Professor Joaqu√≠n Barraquer Moner and she is the granddaughter of Ignacio Barraquer known for their advances in cataract surgery and great-granddaughter of Jos√© Antonio Barraquer Roviralta, founder in 1903 of the Ophthalmological Society of Barcelona and the first professor of ophthalmology in Spain in 1914. Jos√©'s brother Rafael Ignacio Barraquer Compte also dedicates himself to eye surgery. Comte graduated in surgery from the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 1977. She completed her internship at the Vall Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona where in 1978 she obtained a scholarship to specialize in the National Eye Institute belonging to the National Institutes of Health of Bethesda, Maryland. There she made her first surgical trip visiting Port au Prince in Haiti. For two years she was working on the investigation of retinal pigment epithelium cultures and their application in various pathologies. She subsequently joined as a Fellow in eye pathology at the Wilmer Eye Institute of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore . There he was working in the laboratory of Professor W. Richard Green from 1980 to 1983. She had been involved in making up to twelve trips per year to Africa. Her brother who was the director wanted to redirect the family's charitable foundation towards education, research and training. Elena felt that this was the course that her father would have backed. She was no longer able to continue the many trips to Africa, but her foundation attracted young doctors who were keen to continue the work. A visit to Cape Verde involved hundreds of operations and about 500 kg of materials, but the benefit has been estimated to be $20m because the operation not only returns an adult to work but may also release a child carer who can now return to school. Elena and her brother are still co-owners of The Barraquer Clinic.

Her works have been exhibited in places such as the Queens Museum of Art, the Institute for Contemporary Art (Sofia), the Kunsthalle Wien (Austria) and others. In 2006, 2007 and 2009 Kostova received travel grants from the New York Foundation of the Arts (NYFA), the American Foundation for Bulgaria and the European Cultural Foundation. In 2011, she won the Unlimited Award for Contemporary Bulgarian Art and at the same year she started together with Stanislava Georgieva the Bulgarian Artists in America (BAA). In 2016 Kostova exhibited as an A.I.R. Gallery Fellow and was a resident at the Center for Art and Urbanism (ZK/U) in Berlin. In 2019 curator Philippe Batka selected one of Kostova's works for the 12th year of wrapping the Ringturm building in Vienna, Austria. Kostova lives and works in New York City. She is the Director of Curatorial Projects at Radiator Gallery and a Board Member of the CEC Artslink exchange program. Kostova was Director and curator of Irida Art Gallery in Sofia, Bulgaria (2000‚Äì03).  Works and installations  Kostova's work addresses issues of geography and cultural representation. In 2004 Kostova's installation Fixing Reality was created by placing a large blue screen in several public settings in the United States. The screen digitally projected images of her home country Bulgaria in an attempt to bridge the geographic and social gaps between the two countries. In 2019 her art work ‚ÄúCosmonaut 1001‚Ä≥ which features a baby astronaut with communist and capitalist patches on its suit and a white dove sitting on his helmet, was selected as part of the public installation project Future Dreaming to cover the Ringturm building in Vienna. The artistic wrapping of the building was officially opened on 26 June at a ceremony attended by Austrian Foreign and Culture Minister Alexander Schallenberg and Bulgaria‚Äôs Deputy Culture Minister Amelia Gesheva. The 4,000 square meter artwork was covering the facade of the Ringturm facing the Danube Canal in the center of Vienna throughout the summer of 2019, comprising a total of 30 printed sheets, each around 3 meter wide and up to 63 meter long. A recurring topic in Kostova's work is the perception of \\"Safe Play\\" and what it stands for in different cultures and social contexts. Her installations \\"Adventure Playground\\" and \\"Loose\\" are both covering this topic. In 2017 her installation ‚ÄúStuck‚Äù which was a large-scale photo-mural, was commissioned for the exhibition ‚ÄúShifting Layers‚Äù at the Sofia City Art Gallery in Bulgaria. The installation was a reflection on living conditions affected by climate change, and the realization that things can dramatically turn overnight, shifting from play into tragedy.

Military career Graham-Montgomery was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards as a lieutenant in 1869, and saw active service with his regiment in Egypt during the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882, where he was present at the Battle of Tell El Kebir.

He was the son of Colonel Fredrick Charles Trench and Mary-Isabella Oliver Gascoigne and the nephew of Elizabeth Gascoigne from whom he inherited Lotherton Hall. This became the couple's family home. They had three children together: Alvary Douglas Frederick Trench-Gascoigne, Cynthia Mary Trench-Gascoigne (Hill, once she married) and Edward Oliver Trench Gascoigne, who died as an infant.  Life at Lotherton  In 1905 the couple inherited Parlington Hall and moved many of the furnishings from Parlington to Lotherton. Colonel and Mrs. Gascoigne made Lotherton their family home and abandoned Parlington hall which was demolished by the couple in 1950. They equipped Lotherton with central heating and electricity, restored the chapel and added a drawing room, dining room, entrance hall, and servant's wing. In the 1930s the Gascoignes had a lift installed as Colonel Gascoigne was too elderly to get up and down the stairs. After he passed away in 1937,, Lady Gascoigne used the lift until one day it became jammed and she was stuck in it for several hours. After that she refused to use it and insisted on being carried up to bed.  The Gardens  Lady Gascoigne had a keen interest in gardening. She used this knowledge and passion to redo the Lotherton gardens to her liking. Lady Gascoigne and her well known gardening friends of the time William Goldring and Ellen Willmott, designed the Lotherton gardens to complement the rooms of the house. The gardens she designed cover eight acres of the front of the hall as were a project that started between 1903 and 1949. The gardens are made up of walled roses, a rockery and a herbaceous borders.

The author argues that German society had fully atoned for actions done by the country in the past, particularly in World War II, while the United States had not done the same, particularly for Jim Crow violations. Neiman stated that each country has its particular history but that studying the incidents in Germany shows that society can atone for past crimes and improve even though doing so is a difficult process. Neiman in particular believes that many Americans lack an understanding of the United States Civil War as well as the Jim Crow period, contributing to issues in American society present in 2019. She believes the United States would benefit from its own corresponding Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung. \\\\- The date range corresponds to Jim Crow even though it is not said outright. Additionally Neiman uses Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung to refer to Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung. Background Neiman, a Jewish woman, who was born in the Southern United States, had lived there for a portion of her youth. Neiman's mother, who originated from Chicago, had worked to ensure racial integration at Atlanta Public Schools during the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century. Neiman resided in Berlin, Germany beginning in 1989 to study the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and resided there for a period of at least 22 years. She became a moral philosopher, and in Berlin she became the head of the Einstein Forum. The idea came to the book when she noticed American society still celebrating the Confederate States of America even though President of the United States Barack Obama had publicly condemned racism while honoring the victims of the Charleston Church Shooting, which had just happened. She spent at least three years conducting research for the book; that involved reading works about the post-Nazi Germany period, which describe how Germans initially did not feel guilt about the events. In addition to interviewing people in Germany, as part of this task she traveled to the United States and conducted interviews there too; she visited Mississippi in that process. The author said that she incorporated about 50% of the interviews in the book. Neiman's friends argued that the United States's crimes were committed too far in the past and were relatively too insigificant for the country to learn from Germany's understanding of the crimes perpetrated by the country, something that the conclusion of the book disagrees with. The process of the book began prior to the 2016 United States Presidential Election and the Brexit referendum, and she stated that prior to the former she believed the United States was about to absorb messages from historical incidents. The author completed the book despite concerns that the message may not be absorbed in light of the outcomes of those events. Contents The book discusses how society in both East Germany and West Germany initially resisted taking responsibility for World War II incidents, but that this understanding developed decades after the war. This solidified after the reunification of Germany as the two halves could no longer assign blame to the other for atrocities. \\\\- Review issue June 1, 2019. According to Neiman, East German society had more thoroughly opposed Nazism than West Germany partly because the latter opposed Soviet-aligned states with people who formerly worked for Nazi Germany. The book also discusses the Charleston Church Shooting. Reception Deborah E. Lipstadt wrote in The New York Times that the work \\"is an important and welcome weapon in\\" cultural battles about historical events, and that while \\"Optimally, a reviewer‚Äôs evaluation should not be influenced by where she read a book\\", her understanding was enhanced by what she calls attempts from the government of Poland to minimize Polish culpability in the Holocaust. Alex Clark of The Guardian wrote that the author \\"is fascinating and potent on how the Holocaust has functioned on multiple planes, and primarily as an example of pure evil that, by consequence, allows other societies to divert attention from their own misdeeds.\\" Kirkus Reviews stated that the work is \\"A timely, urgent call to revisit the past with an eye to correction and remedy.\\" The publication added that \\"While direct equations between, say, the American secessionists and the Nazis are problematic, there are plenty of points in common.\\" References Further reading * ; Videos * * * External links * Learning from the Germans: Race and the Memory of Evil - Macmillan Publishers * Learning from the Germans: Race and the Memory of Evil - Penguin Books UK * Susan Neiman Official Website Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:Books about Germany Category:Books about the United States Category:Works about philosophy Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:American non- fiction books Category:Reparations for slavery ","title":"Learning from the Germans"},{"id":"62399846","text":"Durno is a surname.

It holds one of the most extensive collections of the research libraries in the United Kingdom with more than one million volumes. In addition to 210,000 printed books in special collections, it has large manuscript and photographic collections while its archives date back to the early 15th century. The library's current role is to support research, scholarship and learning with high-quality services backed by preservation, promotion and exploitation of its collections. King James Library from St Mary's quad History The library was founded by James VI of Scotland in 1612 with gifts from the Royal Family, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Royal Librarian. Originally known at the King James Library, its building was completed in 1643. Between 1710 and 1836, under the Copyright Deposit Act it was entitled to a copy of every book printed in the British Isles. It is therefore exceptionally rich in material from the 18th century. Visiting the library in 1773, Samuel Johnson described it as \\"not very spacious, but elegant and luminous\\". In 1783, the Kings James Library, St Mary's College Library and the university's other library facilities were brought together under one roof as the common library in 1783. By the mid-19th century, its collection had grown to 40,000 volumes. After extensions in 1890, a new library was completed in 1908 in what is now the Psychology building. As a result of further increases in students and holdings, today's library building was opened on North Street in 1976 where it now holds over a million books. The building was designed by the architects Faulkner-Brown Hendy Watkinson Stonor based in the North East of England at Killingworth. Faulkner-Brown specialised in libraries and leisure facilities and also designed the National Library of Canada in Ottawa and the Robinson Library at Newcastle University In 2011 the main library building underwent a ¬£7 million re-development. St Mary's College Library incorporating the King James library from 1643 continues to house the university's Divinity and Medieval History collections. In 2012 the university purchased the vacant Martyrs' Kirk on North Street, with the purpose of providing reading rooms for the Special Collections department and university postgraduate research students and staff. Special collections Dating from the early Middle Ages, material in the Manuscript Department includes muniments of the university itself as well as estate, business and personal records from the Fife region and the town of St Andrews. There are also manuscript papers on Baron Friedrich von H√ºgel and other individuals belonging to the Catholic Modernists. The library's archive contains a rich series of catalogues from its foundation as well as borrowing registers from 1738 to 1925. Comprising some 300,000 images, the photographic collection is one of Scotland's largest. It includes early examples of St Andrew's involvement in the history of photography as well as published and unpublished items and albums from the 1840s on. Of particular importance is the negative archive of picture postcards from Valentine & Sons of Dundee from the mid-19th century to the 1960s. It also contains the negatives of the local press photographer George M. Cowie and of the botanist Robert M. Adam. The rare books collections comprise over 50 named collections comprising gifts from other libraries and subject-based collections based on illustrated children's literature and photographically illustrated books. The historic Copyright Music Collection consists of some 400 bound volumes, most of the music dating from the 1790s to the 1820s.

His work documented the tribulations of life in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans.  Life and Career  Herbert Singleton was born the eldest of eight children on May 31, 1945 to Elizabeth and Herbert Singleton Sr. Singleton recalled that one day when he was ten years old, his father left the house to buy a pack of cigarettes and never returned. His mother supported the family on her single income working at a hospital. He attended school until the seventh grade, although other accounts claim the sixth grade. He worked most of his youth in a steel factory and as a bridge painter. He was arrested as a young adult for various narcotic crimes and spent thirteen years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary between 1967 and 1986. After his release, he began making little clay snake sculptures for the Voodoo Museum in New Orleans in 1970. Distraught by the fragility of unfired clay, Singleton switched his medium to wood and began carving long ax handles into walking sticks, primarily used as weapons. His customers were pimps, drug dealers, and horse-and-carriage drivers in the French Quarter. In fact, one carriage driver notoriously killed a robber during a mugging with one of Singleton's sticks, and thus they became known as \\"Killer Sticks.\\" His later work was carved on doors and other solid woods found on the banks of the Mississippi River. It is estimated that Singleton completed over 200 works, although his earliest creations cannot be counted accurately. He lived the rest of his life in Algiers, a New Orleans' neighborhood on the western bank of the Mississippi River. He died at the age of 62.  Subject and materials  Singleton used manual tools such as knives, chisels and mallets to carve his pieces. Most of the wood he used he collected from the levees bordering Mississippi River. He often found oak and cypress doors and cabinets to work with. Reflecting on his artistic process, Singleton said, \\"When the river was low, I would find a plank of wood to carve. I would look at it and wonder if someone's life fell apart.\\" He painted his reliefs and carvings with saturated enamel primary colors. His early carvings, \\"killer sticks,\\" and stools depict intricate scenes of violence, lynchings, drugs, dealing, prostitution, and other every-day scenes from the inner-city of New Orleans. His stylized, dramatic narratives come from personal experience living amidst violent crime, police brutality, and financial instability. In 1980 his sister and two friends were murdered by three white police officers searching for an African American person who shot another white officer. They took Singleton in for questioning, beat, and suffocated him for twelve hours. None of the officers were charged for the murders or cruel punishment. The art historian and curator Alice Rae Yelen noted a shift in his subject matter mid-career. Once Singleton switched to doors and larger materials, He began to depict biblical scenes, local social situations, and autobiographical subjects. Broadly, Singleton's subject matter can be categorized as either religious scenes, scenes from contemporary African American street life, or socio- political themes from local to international scope.

History  The origins of the PCD can be traced back to a note issued to the press on 31 December 1935. The note attempted to justify the previous day's cabinet reshuffle, carried out by Prime Minister Manuel Portela Valladares with the support of President Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora, by describing it as 'a necessary effort to create a Republican center'. A number of those appointed to Portela's new cabinet would go on to join the PCD. The party's manifesto, published on January 28, 1936, 'rejected both \\"civil war\\" and \\"red revolution\\"' whilst 'stressing constitutional process, national unity and progress.'. Manuel Portela Valladares' cabinet on 30 December 1935. In the run-up to the 1936 Spanish general elections, Portela and the PCD initially tried to forge an alliance with the political left. Portela's offer was 'roundly rejected' in all provinces but Lugo and Alicante, and he instead turned to the political right. In total 89 PCD candidates stood for election in 1936. However, by the time the elections took place this number had fallen to 78 - the result of numerous defections; with only 23 securing places on 'broader center-right coalition tickets'. The PCD's failure to make a breakthrough in the 1936 elections has been attributed to both Portela's attempt to try and rapidly build a new party ex nihilo in a period of increased radicalisation, and his failure to build the strong alliance with either the left or the right that he deemed necessary. The PCD initially won 21 seats in the 1936 elections. This total later fell to 18 when elections in Cuenca and Granada were re-held in an attempt to mitigate the impact of acts of electoral fraud carried out by the political right. It has been alleged that Alcal√°-Zamora pressured the comisi√≥n de actas, the committee for examining electoral validity, into approving the election of Portela in Pontevedra despite the existence of evidence of electoral malpractice in the city. The PCD's participation in government came to an end with the resignation of a 'terror-stricken' Portela on 19 February 1936. 5 members of the PCD were the only deputies to vote against the removal of Alcal√°-Zamora as President of the Republic.

GGTS utilized the Magnetically Anchored Gravity Systems (MACS), which consisted of two identical subsystem packages, each containing an extensible rod unit and a magnetically anchored spherical viscous damper.

He grew up eating his great-grandmother's Tex- Mex cooking, which he described as, \\"all from scratch and very simple‚Äîit‚Äôs what you would call farm-to-table, because they had a little garden and a little produce stand.\\" Centeno's father was a butcher and his great- grandfather, Joe Centeno Sr., founded Centeno supermarkets, the first chain of independent Latino groceries in the US. Centeno graduated from San Antonio Academy, Central Catholic Marianist High School and the Culinary Institute of America.  Career  Centeno opened B√§co Mercat in 2011. Bar Am√° was named for his maternal great-grandmother, an immigrant from Mexico during the Mexican Revolution, who Centeno said cooked Tex-Mex food. Centeno described her food as \\"Simple cooking that wasn‚Äôt authentically Mexican but not the melted-cheese-topped stuff people usually talk about when describing Tex-Mex.\\" In June 2019 his restaurant Orsa & Winston earned a Michelin star. In July of 2019 he opened Am√°cita in Culver City. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic Centeno was one of the first chefs to shut down his restaurants entirely, telling his employees told \\"to file for unemployment [right then], because by [the following] week, it was going to be a shitshow.‚Äù  Cookbooks  Centeno's first cookbook, Baco: Vivid Recipes from the Heart of Los Angeles (2017), co-written with his life partner and former LA Times food editor Betty Hallock, focussed on the cuisine of Los Angeles. Food & Wine said it was \\"about being an Angeleno and an American who breaks boundaries and celebrates multicultural flavors.\\" LAist named it to their list of \\"essential cookbooks for the modern Angeleno.\\" Centeno's second cookbook Am√°: a modern Tex-Mex kitchen ( 2019), also co-written with Hallock, was published by Chronicle Books. The New Yorker named it one of the best books of the year and Eater one of the best cookbooks of fall of 2019.  Philosophy  Centeno, who says he \\"grew up during the commercialization of Tex-Mex\\", originally avoided cooking Tex-Mex and instead, \\"ran as far away from San Antonio as I could. I moved to New York and got into French cooking.\\" According to the Wall Street Journal, Centeno sees Tex-Mex as \\"not a cuisine based on processed cheese. It is rather a genre of cooking developed by necessity, by people uprooted from where they came from, who happened to arrive in Texas.\\"  Honors  In February 2020 Centeno was named a semifinalist for Best Chef by the James Beard Foundation.  Reception  The Wall Street Journal called his restaurants Bar Am√° and Am√°cita \\"the country‚Äôs most thoughtful Tex-Mex.\\" The New York Times named Amacita's hamachi collar one of the ten best Los Angeles dishes of 2019. Bloomberg named Bar Ama's queso one of the best in the world.

He began his solo career as Samzanov, before releasing his first single as Tima on 3 May 2017. His 7th single, Wet Sneakers (Russian: –ú–æ–∫—Ä—ã–µ –∫—Ä–æ—Å—Å—ã), was his first big hit, reaching 35th on the Apple Music Top 100 in Russia for 2018 and winning the HEAT music award for Hit of the Year. Throughout his entire career, he has been signed to the small Belarusian record label Kaufman Label. In 2019, Tima released his first album, Your First Disc is my Cassette (Russian: –¢–≤–æ–π –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –¥–∏—Å–∫ ‚Äì –º–æ—è –∫–∞—Å—Å–µ—Ç–∞), and was later nominated for the RU.TV Powerful Start award. On 23 November 2019, he was awarded a Russkoye Radio Golden Gramophone at the 2019 Golden Gramophone awards.  Biography  Timofey Andreyevich Morozov was born on 1 October 1998, in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. His mother, a music teacher, and his father, an opera soloist, allowed Tima to be exposed music from a young age. His mother often played the music of English bassist Sting, while his father enjoyed guitarist and pianist Leonid Agutin. His father also regularly sang and played their piano. From 3 years old, after his parents' divorce, his father brought him on his tours in Germany every summer. According to Tima, he had always had an interest in music. As such, at 6, Tima's parents took him to a music school and presented him with different instruments, where he settled on playing the cello. Though he never engaged in sport professionally, he was especially fond of football during his time in primary school before slowly losing interest and moving further to music. He had also spent time working selling ice-cream and as a dockworker, and, at the time of releasing Wet Crosses, a server at a restaurant. After completing primary school, Tima began attending the Belarusian State Academy of Music, though he soon after moved to a linguistics college. After completing school, he started to study for an art degree, though he only attended for under a semester. Throughout his attendance at school, he achieved high grades. In 2016, Tima's current record label, Kaufman Label, were holding auditions in the Minsk club Re: Public. While Tima performed, only one of the three judges voted for him. After reviewing auditions from other applicants, and selecting two different artists, the label's administrator told the judges to listen to his single RASSVET. They liked it, though felt it \\"had to be rewritten\\". Eventually, they contacted Tima at 2am in the morning to bring him into the studio. His stage name, Tima Belorusskih, was chosen as he wanted to stay associated with Belarus, even while popular in other countries.  Personal life  Tima has said that he tries to keep his personal life separate from his music career, and as such he is rarely seen together with his partner. However, in 2019, Russia newspaper SUPER announced that he has a daughter, Sofia, who was born in 2015. At the time, Tima was 16 years old and his partner, Yana, was 17.

The protein monomers are shown in blue and green while the DNA is shown in tan. The DNA Bases in the GANTC recognition site are shown in all atom resolution. CcrM is an orphan DNA methyltransferase, that is involved in controlling gene expression in most Alphaproteobacteria. This enzyme modifies DNA by catalyzing the transference of a methyl group from the S-adenosyl-L methionine substrate to the N6 position of an adenine base in the sequence 5'-GANTC-3' with high specificity. In Caulobacter crescentus Ccrm is produced at the end of the replication cycle when Ccrm recognition sites are hemimethylated, rapidly methylating the DNA. CcrM is essential in other Alphaproteobacteria but is role is not yet determined. CcrM is a highly specific methyltransferase with a novel DNA recognition mechanism.  CcrM role in cell cycle regulation  Methylations are epigenetic modification that, in eukaryotes, regulates processes as cell differentiation, and embryogenesis, while in prokaryotes can have a role in self recognition, protecting the DNA from being cleaved by the restriction endonuclease system, or for gene regulation. The first function is controlled by the restriction methylation system while the second by Orphan MTases as Dam and CcrM. CcrM role have been characterized in the marine model organism Caulobacter crescentus, which is suitable for the study of cell cycle and epigenetics as it asymmetrically divides generating different progeny, a stalked and a swarmer cell, with different phenotypes and gene regulation. The swarmer cell has a single flagellum and polar pili and is characterized by its mobility, while the stacked cell has a stalk and is fixed to the substrate. The stacked cell enters immediately in S-phase, while the swarmer cell stays in G1-phase and will differentiate to a stacked cell before entering the S-phase again. The stacked cell in S phase will replicate its DNA in a semiconservative manner producing two hemimethylated DNA double strands that will be rapidly methylated by the Methyltransferase CcrM, which is only produced at the end of the S phase. The enzyme will methylate more than 4 thousand 5'-GANTC-3' sites in around 20 minutes, and then it will be degraded by the LON protease. This fast methylation plays an important role in the transcriptional control of several genes and controls the cell differentiation. CcrM expression is regulated by the CtrA master regulator, and in addition various 5'-GANTC-3' sites methylation sites regulate CcrM expression, which will only occur at the end of the S phase when this sites are hemimethylated. In this process CtrA regulates the expression of CcrM and more than 1000 genes in the pre-divisional state, and SciP prevents the activation of CcrM transcription in non replicative cells.  CcrM role in Alphaproteobacteria  Orphan MTases are common in bacteria and archea CcrM is found in almost every group of Alphaproteobacteria, excepting in Rickettsiales and Magnetococcales, and homologs can be found inEpsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Alphaproteobacteria are organisms with different life stages from free living to substrate associated, some of them are intracellular pathogens of plants, animal and even human, in those groups the CcrMs must have an important role in cell cycle progression. CcrM miss regulation have shown to produce severe miss control of cell cycle regulation and differentiation in various Alphaproteobacteria; C. crescentus , the plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti and in the human pathogen Brucella abortus. Also CcrM gene has proven to be essential for the viability of various Alphaproteobacteria.  Structure and DNA recognition mechanism  CcrM is a type II DNA Methyltransferase, that transfer a methyl group from the methyl donor SAM to the N6 of an adenine in a 5'-GANTC-3' recognition sites of hemimethylated DNA. Based on the order of the conserved motifs that form the SAM binding, the active site and the target recognition domain in the sequence of CcrM it can be classified as a Œ≤-class adenine N6 Methyltransferase. CcrM homologs in Alphaproteobacteria have an 80 residues C terminal domain, with non well characterized function. CcrM is characterized by a high degree of sequence discrimination, showing a very high specificity for GANTC sites over AANTC sites , being able to recognize and methylate this sequence in both double and single strand DNA. CcrM in complex with a dsDNA structure was resolved, showing that the enzyme presents a novel DNA interaction mechanism, opening a bubble in the DNA recognition site (The concerted mechanism of Methyltransferases relies in the flip of the target base), the enzyme interacts with DNA forming an homodimer with differential monomer interactions. CcrM is a highly efficient enzyme capable of methylating a high number of 5'-GANTC-3' sites in low time, however if the enzyme is processive (the enzyme binds to the DNA and methylate several methylation sites before dissociation) or distributive (the enzyme dissociates from DNA after each methylation) it is still in discussion. First reports indicated the second case, however more recent characterisation of CcrM indicate that it is a processive enzyme.

Established by Lebanese American Jalal Antone, it grew to having fifteen locations and having products distributed throughout the Southern United States, but was beset by ownership disputes within the surviving family in the 1990s. Legacy Restaurants now owns the trademark and operates all restaurants with the name. From circa the 1990s until 2018 several shops franchising the Antone's name were operated as the Original Antone's Import Company. History A Lebanese American man, Jalal E. Antone, was born on February 21, 1912 in Louisiana. Originating from Port Arthur, Texas, \\\\- The full names and birth, marriage, and death dates of Jalal and Josephine Antone are on the headstone pictured in the article came to Houston in the 1930s. There he managed a business to import and export goods. Antone married Josephine A. Antone (born August 14, 1914) on October 6, 1940. The couple had two daughters, Mary Jo Antone-Hatfield and Jamie Lee Antone. Antone established the chain in 1962 as a restaurant on Taft Street, in the Fourth Ward. Originally he wanted to serve Levantine cuisine to Lebanese and Syrian Americans, but his brother in law stated that area residents at the time would not be accustomed to those cuisines, and so the business needed to be openly focused around more familiar cuisine. Therefore Antone chose to make sandwiches the primary selling point of the business while offering Levantine food on the side for the immigrants, and he advised other ethnic Levantine restaurant operators to not openly market the restaurants as being Middle Eastern. Therefore by 2008 multiple Houston-area restaurants selling Levantine cuisine also served sandwiches. The company's second and third locations were on Main Street and the intersection of San Felipe Road and Voss Road, respectively, with the former opening in 1967. Josephine received 98% of the company and the daughters received the remainder, after Jalal Antone's February 9, 1974 death. Josephine was the head of Antone's and sublicensed to her daughters the rights to do catering, as J.J. Gregory Gourmet Services. Antone-Hatfield stated that she entered the business upon her father's request even though she initially planned to work in the music industry as she studied theater and music. In 1976 a 20-year-old Lebanese man named Antonios \\"Tony\\" Okde, unrelated to the Antone family and a civil engineering major at the University of Houston, began manning the cash register at an Antone's. Okde, who went to Houston to avoid the Lebanese Civil War, had originally intended on making money to support himself during his studies and planned on having a career in a petroleum firm, but he grew in the business, assuming more responsibilities and opening his own franchises. Okde occupied a post on the board of directors by the 1980s. The mother and daughters became involved in several lawsuits, with Okde siding with the mother. The mother-controlled company accused the daughters of not following the licensing terms and filed suit against the daughters; the arbitration resulted in a win for the defendants. Okde served as the company's director of operations by the year 1990, and as a vice president the same year. Additional lawsuits were filed by the company against the daughters when the company accused the latter of allowing supermarkets to sell Antone's products without permission and insufficient royalty payments in 1992 and trying to improperly sell the franchise in 1996. By the latter year the daughters and mother were not on speaking terms; the daughters accused Okde and another member of the board, Peter Basralian, of tricking Josephine, an accusation the men denied. Around fifteen Antone's shops were in Houston circa the 1990s. In addition licensed Antone's products appeared throughout the Southern United States. An investor named Neil Morgan acquired J.J. Gregory Gourmet's assets in 1996 after the company entered bankruptcy. Even though the mother wanted Okde to remain, he had plans to resign from Antone's in 1999. Josephine on March 15, 2003, and the original Fourth Ward location closed the same year. Circa 2005 Morgan bought the trademarks from Josephine's estate. Antone's became a part of the Legacy Restaurants umbrella in 2006, and therefore Legacy now held the Antone's trademark. The Okde family continued operating their own franchised Antone's, using the name Original Antone's. Vana Inc., with Tony Okde being one of the owners, was the operating company. In 2008 there were four Legacy Antone's and three Vana Antone's. John Nova Lomax of Houstonia wrote that the Legacy locations \\"franchised and tried to take the name far and wide\\" while the Original ones \\"kept things close to home and more traditional\\", and that the fissure developed in the 1990s. By 2012, four Antone's remained in Houston. The franchise agreements ultimately expired, with Legacy not allowing renewal, in April 2018; the Okdes chose not to file lawsuits and instead decided to run sandwich shops under new names; the Okde's legal representation agreed that Legacy had the rights to the Antone's name. By 2018 there were only two Antone's remaining in Houston. In 2018 grocery stores in Austin, Texas again began selling Antone's sandwiches. The Antone's nightclub in Austin, established by Jalal Antone's nephew, Clifford Antone, began selling Antone's sandwiches in 2018. The varieties available at the nightclub are Original, Super, Tuna, and Turkey. In 2020 an Antone's Famous Po'Boys location in the Texas Medical Center opened. Products and cuisine Antone developed a Po-Boy, with chowchow added to ham, salami and provolone cheese, and is traditionally served cold. The sandwich is currently known as the \\"Original Po' Boy\\" and was previously the \\"regular\\". There is also a version with added meats and cheeses called the \\"Super\\". Stephen Paulsen of the Houston Chronicle stated that the \\"Original\\" variety is \\"in the city‚Äôs food DNA, the Shipley Do- Nuts of sandwiches.\\" John Lomax of Houstonia described the 1970s and 1980s as the height of their popularity and that the growth of chain sandwich shops that operated across the United States, the introduction of banh mi, and the poor quality of third party sandwiches in gas stations resulted in a decrease in popularity for the variety. Lomax in particular stated that the storage of the sandwiches at grocery stores ruined the flavor due to the delicate properties of the chowchow and mayonnaise. In 2002, 40% of the sandwiches sold at Antone's were the \\"Original\\" variety. Other menu items include roast beef and smoked turkey sandwiches as well as chicken salad, ham salad (known as \\"Piggy\\"), and sweet pickles. According to Legacy, the other varieties were available by the year 1970 but the company had no specific information on when each variety was first available. Legacy introduced Italian-style menu items and salads after it assumed 2006 ownership. Historically the company had, aside from chowchow sandwiches, ones with mayonnaise available. Morgan's restaurants added other sauces in 2002 due to some customers wanting bolder flavors. The restaurant also sells a \\"Tex-Mex Cheesesteak\\" that was ranked number one in the \\"Best Sandwiches in America 2019\\", a ranking by Legacy Restaurants executive chef Alex Padilla. \\\\- Alternate link dated 2019-07-25 The stores also sell or sold cheeses, pasta, and pickled seafood products. The Houston company Royal Bakery supplies the bread used by Antone's restaurants. Okde's family stated that Tony Okde had created several of the menu items; a Legacy representative stated that the company was unaware of this, and if this was indeed the case, the company in 2018 does not any longer sell these items.

California Cooper. It tells the story of multiple generations of African American slaves from the point of view of the dead Clora, who killed herself and tried to kill her four children in order to escape slavery. Clora follows her four children around the world through the years, but keeps a special eye on Always, her favorite child. The novel spans from 1840 through 1933, with Clora waking up and skipping to different time periods throughout the years. Academic James Weaver has noted that the novel \\"has remained relatively understudied and undervalued for its contribution to the genre.\\"  Plot Summary   Within Swallow-Land  The novel begins with the ghost of Clora describing the start of slavery and her early life. Her mother Fammy was repeatedly raped by the Master of the Land bore him nine children, all of whom were sold by the Mistress of the Land by the time they were three years old. In order to combat this, Fammy had a child with another Black slave, who she named Clora. The torture of being a slave was too much for her, however, and Flora committed a murder-suicide with the Master of the Land, leaving Clora behind in the hands of Miz Elliz, another slave. The Master's son, the Young Master of the Land, took over in his place and eventually began raping Clora before she was even twelve years old, forcing her to give birth to several children, Always, Sun, Peach, and Plum. Fearing the sale of her children and her own death by the Mistress and Master of the Land, Clora tried to feed herself and her children poison tea. Only Clora died and her ghost followed the lives of all of her children, particularly the eldest child Always. Clora's children were constantly tormented by the Young Master's children with the Young Mistress, Loretta and Virginia. Virginia despised pretty slaves like Always and Peach because she felt that she was ugly. Loretta was sympathetic towards Sun as she could tell that they were related, giving him preferential treatment and assisting in multiple escape attempts. After a second, successful escape attempt Sun repeatedly asked Loretta to help Peach escape, only for Loretta to push her mother to sell Peach out of jealousy. The man that Peach was sold to was a nice man and eventually the two fell in love and moved to Scotland, where she changed her name to Peachel and her children grew in a wealthy household, became educated, and got high paying jobs. Sun was also able to gain happiness. When he was seventeen he was able to convince a business owner to let him work for only some food and a place to sleep. His hard work eventually convinces the business owner, Mr. DuBois, to promote Sun to work for his other businesses. Mr. DuBois's daughter also falls in love with Sun and they have children in a wealthy household. By 1844 Always and Plum are the only two siblings remaining on the farm, which is now in very deep debt. Always is sold to a well-off land owner named Doak Butler, who purchased her as a slave for his fianc√© Wanda Sue. Unable to imagine a life without her sibling, Plum manages to secretly hide herself on the bottom of the buggy but is crushed and bleeds to death by a mechanism underneath the buggy.  Before the Civil War  Once at his land, Doak rapes Always and forces her to clean up the remnants of her dead sister. She is also introduced to Poon, another slave, and Jason, Doak's brother, who was paralyzed from the waist down. Hoping to earn some money for herself, Always decides to take care of the farm but soon discovers that she's pregnant with Doak's child. She is also surprised to discover that she doesn't hate Wanda Sue, who is by now married to Doak and also pregnant with his child. Always receives kind and preferential treatment from Wanda Sue, who allows her to rebuild the chicken coop so that Always would have a private place to sleep with her future child, but asked Always to be present with her when it became time for her to give birth. Eventually both women give birth to their respective children on the same day, both of whom are boys. Noticing that her son had Doak's blue eyes whereas Wanda Sue's doesn't, Always switches the two children out so her son can escape becoming a slave. In order for them to have something that connects them, she burns a mole onto his and her hip. She chooses to name Wanda Sue's child \\"Soon\\" while Doak and Wanda Sue name Always's son Doak Jr. The two boys are very close, resulting in Doak Jr preventing Soon's sale even as all of Always's other children by Doak are sold before they were six years old. The proceeds from the sales are used to expand the now profitable farm and Always names the land after her missing children. Wanda Sue, on the other hand, does not become pregnant again for many years and when she does become pregnant, dies along with the second child after falling ill. After Wanda Sue's death Doak continues to sexually abuse Always but soon decides to marry the daughter of the Young Master of the Land, Loretta. Aware that Soon and Doak Jr are related to one another, Loretta makes several attempts to turn the boys against one another but is unsuccessful. It isn't until the boys grow older, however, that their relationship changes and Doak Jr began to play the role of the master and started treating Soon unkindly. When the Civil War begins Doak leaves the farm to fight for the Confederacy, where he meets his own death. This prompts Doak Jr to leave and fight in his father's place and Soon is sent with him in order to protect Doak Jr. While the two boys were gone, many slaves fled and stole from the farm. One of Always's missing children returns to the farm as a runaway slave and is hired by Loretta to serve as her carriage driver. He only stays for three months before fleeing with the carriage, which devastates Loretta, who had become pregnant with his child. Loretta asks Always for help in aborting the fetus via an abortifacient tea, only for Always to secretly feed her prenatal teas so she gives birth to a healthy child. Once the child is born Loretta convinces Always to take care of the child, who was named Apple.  After the Civil War  After the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery Always chooses to remain on the farm but not take care of Loretta, who unsuccessfully tries to threaten her into maintaining the status quo. Now home with Soon, Doak Jr tries to force Always into revealing the location of gold she helped his father bury, only for Always to tell him that she is his true mother. He initially tries to kill her in a rage, but stops as he knows that she's the only one who knows the location of the gold. Always tells him that she will not tell anyone that they are related as long as he buys her the land. As time passes Always marries a quiet man named Time and has a child with him, Master More, however Doak Jr is still resentful towards her since he felt that she had bested him. Soon chooses to stay with Always and that he would wait to get married elsewhere. Upon hearing that the war is over, Peach and Sun return to the South to visit Always and see Plum's grave. They discuss living arrangements for Soon and Apple, who are able to access more educational opportunities since they could pass as white. Apple chooses to leave with Peach to Scotland in order to get an education, while Soon leaves with Sun to the North in order to become a veterinarian. Sun and Loretta reunite and she is invited to come live with him in the North as well. Clora then fell asleep for about 50 years, and when she awoke, Sun was dead, Always was dying, and Peach was incredibly old. She realized that she had grandchildren and great- grandchildren living all over the world, some as White, others as Black and every color in between. She learns about the Ku Klux Klan and blames humanity for the violent repetition of history, calling to the audience and telling them that they need to change their point of view. She explains that everyone is related to one another, no matter ones race, and that it is the audience's job to realize that they are a part of the Human Family in order to stop the violence within humanity.  Characters  * Clora: Clora is the narrator of the novel. After realizing that the slave master was going to kill her for protecting her child, she decided to concoct a poisonous tea for herself and her children. She did not want her children to continue living as slaves, especially without their mother. However, somehow she was the only one that died from the tea. Her spirit follows the lives of her four children (Always, Sun, Peach, and Plum), as well as their children. She is very family oriented and follows Always‚Äô life the closest. * Always: Clora's oldest and most favorite child. A very hardworking girl who cares greatly about her siblings, especially Plum. After being enslaved in on a farm in Swallow-Land, with Loretta being one of her masters, she is then sold to a well-off land owner named Doak. After he rapes her and disregards Plum's death, Always vows to forever hate him. She tries to hate his wife, Wanda Sue, but she is too kind to her. Always becomes pregnant with Doak's child at the same time that Wanda Sue is pregnant, and during the birth of the children decides to switch the children so that her biological child is raised in a wealthy household rather than slavery. * Sun: Clora's second oldest child and described as light- skinned enough to pass as white. As a child, he and his half sister Loretta became close and devised a plan for Sun to escape Swallow-Land. After being taught how to read and write by his half sister, Loretta and Sun attempted to get Sun up North. The first time, he was caught and almost killed as punishment. Him and Loretta were successful the second time, and Sun adopted the name ‚ÄúMr. Freer‚Äù when he wrote to Loretta in order to try to buy his siblings. Sun was eventually hired by Mr. DuBois, a wealthy man in the food industry, and was eventually promoted within his various businesses. Sun ended up marrying Mr. DuBois's daughter and lived a wealthy lifestyle, never letting anyone know that he was the son of a slave. * Peach: Clora's third oldest child, described as almost-white and very pretty. Sun taught her how to read and write, and her main job was within the main house, specifically taking care of Loretta's room. Loretta eventually asked her mother to sell Peach, who was sold to a nice gentleman looking for a slave to take care of his wife. His wife died eight months into the arrangement, and eventually the gentleman and Peach fell in love and got married. They moved to Scotland and lived in extreme wealth. * Plum: Clora's youngest child, often described as a weak and very sickly. Always was her caretaker and when she learned that Always was sold, she attempted to stow away on the bottom of the buggy. However, due to the mechanism of the buggy, she was crushed and then bled to death. * Loretta: The daughter of the Young Master of the Land as well as Always's, Sun's, Peach's, and Plum's half sister. She is very selfish and high-maintenance, but had love for her brother, Sun. She helped him escape to the North, but was jealous when he asked her to help Peach so she got her sold. She eventually marries Master Doak and Wanda Sue dies, and her hatred for Always grows. She has a child with one of Always's children, who was named Apple. * Master Doak: The man who purchases Always from Swallow-Land. He rapes and impregnates Always when she first arrives to his land. Described as mostly clueless to the going ons of his land and prefers for the slaves and his brother to work the land. He is the husband of Wanda Sue and the father of Doak Jr. After Wanda Sue died, he married Loretta. He dies while off at war. * Wanda Sue: Master Doak's wife and the mother of Doak Jr. A kind and caring white woman who becomes very attached to Always. She dies during her second pregnancy, along with her second child. She never learns that the child she raised was never biologically hers. * Doak Jr: The biological child of Always, but raised by Wanda Sue and Master Doak. As a child, he is best friends with Soon, but once Loretta comes into his life, his perspective changes as he grows into the role of a slave owner. * Soon: The biological child of Wanda Sue, but raised by Always. He is friends with Doak Jr. and goes to war with him in order to protect him. He is raised as a slave even though he is actually white.  Themes  Cooper uses the main narrator, Clora, as a vessel to speak to the audience members, which is unusual within common neo-slave narratives. Cooper‚Äôs novel enacts rehabilitative storytelling, which forces readers to acknowledge the slave history within the United States as well and urges for social regeneration in the present. Cooper‚Äôs novel gives its audience members a call to action and to work on ridding themselves of racists tendencies. Cooper also discusses racial identity within the novel as most of the children, such as Sun, Peach, and Doak Jr. are biracial. The concept of passing as another race is demonstrated by Peach never discussing her racial background and only being able to take family members back to Scotland who appeared white. Similarly, the only reason that Sun was able to escape the South was because the color of his skin was so white. Within the novel, Cooper demonstrates both how passing for a different race was used as a method for survival, as well as the pointlessness for discriminating against one another via race.  Critical reception  Critical reception for the novel has been positive. In an article for the CLA Journal, Cynthia Downing Bryant noted that Family provides an \\"extensive exploration of the benefits and consequences of passing\\" but that Cooper \\"consistently makes it clear that passing may be a means to an end, but it simply cannot yield true self-liberation.\\" The novel has also been praised alongside Cooper's 1998 The Wake of the Wind as \\"historically grounded studies of the horror and complexity of slaver and its aftereffects. Both novels add to our understanding of some of the more difficult aspects of African American life since the mid-to-late 1800s.\\" A reviewer for The Washington Post was critical in their review, stating that \\"the book suffers from a flat first-person narrative that does not allow the characters to take life, a serious lack of information about slavery and a tendency to cliche: \\"But life and time just kept movin on, like it always does.\\"\\" Roy Hoffman for the New York Times was more positive, calling it \\"he sort of book that ought to be read out loud\\".

She graduated in 2003 with a first-class degree in Islamic Arts at the King Abdul Aziz University. She worked there as a lecturer before moving to the University of Coventry to study for an MA, then a PhD in Visual Art. Al Ghamdi's artistic practice centres around large-scale pieces inspired and driven by women's experiences of life and craft in the home. In Venice, her installation was made up of 52,000 pieces of re-worked leather inspired by organic forms, her home in Al-Baha and Aseeri ornaments. The work took its title from a sixth-century poem by Zuhayr bin Abƒ´ S≈´lmƒÅ. All their work bridges poetics and domestic landscapes. In 2017, al Ghamdi created a site- specific land art installation in the Great Court at the British Museum, covering 30 square metres with a village of sand and memory.

Raised as XXVI Bersaglieri Battalion in 1859 the battalion became autonomous on 15 April 1977 and received the war flag and traditions of the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment of the Royal Italian Army.  History   Formation  The XXVI Bersaglieri Battalion was raised in August 1859 and immediately distinguished itself at the Battle of Castelfidardo in 1860, earning a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. On 31 December 1861 the battalion entered the newly raised 4th Bersaglieri Regiment.  World War I  During World War I the regiment fought on the Italian front, while the XXVI Battalion was on garrison duty in Italian occupied Rhodes since 1912.  World War II  During World War II regiment and battalion were sent to Albania on 7 November 1940 to fight in the Greco-Italian War. Decimated by the strong Greek resistance and counteroffensive the regiment was reduced to the battalion-sized \\"Fast Reconnaissance Unit\\" on 12 April 1941. In this format the remnants of the regiment pursued the Greek armies, which had been forced to retreat after the German Wehrmacht had invaded Greece from Bulgaria on 6 April 1941. On 19 April the regiment's commanding officer Colonel Guglielmo Scognamiglio fell in an skirmish with the Greek rearguards at Borov√´. For its conduct in Albania the regiment was awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valour. The death of the regiment's colonel is commemorated in the canton of its coat of arms by the azure band with three stars. After Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment and the XXVI Battalion were cut off in Dalmatia and forced to surrender to German forces. The regiment was raised again on 1 February 1944 with the XXI and XXXIII battalions, the latter of which had fought German forces on Corsica after 8 September. As part of the Italian Liberation Corps the regiment fought on the allied side in the Italian campaign. After having sustained heavy losses fighting on the Winter Line and in the Battle of Ancona the regiment was reduced to Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Goito\\" on 24 September 1944 and joined the Combat Group \\"Legnano\\". After the war the \\"Goito\\" battalion entered the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment on 1 July 1946.

The battalion was based in Pordenone and part of the 8th Mechanized Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\". For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. In the early 1980s the battalion moved to Maniago, where it remained until the Garibaldi was transferred to Caserta in Southern Italy in 1991. The Castelfidardo then joined the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\" for a short time, before its name was transferred to the 2nd (Recruits Training) Battalion \\"Pordenone\\" in Pordenone. For the next years the Castelfidardo trained the recruits destined for the \\"Ariete\\" brigade, until on 29 May 1998 the battalion was disbanded and the war flag of the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

The architectural style of the wood framed St. Mary Catholic Church is Carpenter Gothic (Gothic Revival). In the early 1910s, after several families of Polish descent decided to relocate to Korona, Florida, they raised $1000 to build a Catholic church in the town. Korona means ‚Äúcrown‚Äù in Polish, signifying the patron saint of Poland, the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is also referred to as ‚ÄúQueen of Poland.‚Äù They constructed the church building in 1914 and originally named it St. Mary, Queen of Poland, Catholic Church, but later changed its name to St. Mary Catholic Church. The original St. Mary Catholic Church is still in use for daily mass, baptisms, funerals, weddings and silent prayer services. From its beginning, the St. Mary Catholic Church building has been a focal point for the Korona community. It continues to remain intimately connected with the spiritual and cultural lives of the area's citizens. The St. Mary Catholic Church is the oldest church building in Flagler County. The property where the St. Mary Catholic Church is located includes the Shrine of Saint Christopher and four other buildings: Parish Thrift Store, Storage Shed, Parish Center Office and the Main Church.Jaye, Randy.

Bunnell, FL: Dolphin Printing & Design, Inc., 2014. Architectural attributes The St. Mary Catholic Church has 1955 square feet as it measures 31 feet wide by 62 feet long and includes a 3 feet wide by 11 feet long part of the garage extension that protrudes from the northeast corner of the building. Exterior Most of the building's exterior has white painted solid wood board and batten siding running horizontally. Wood lattice skirting covers the underfloor access areas around the bottom of the building. There are eight lancet windows in the building. These windows are tall and narrow with a pointed arch at the top, which mimic the architectural styling found in original Gothic churches. The glass in all of the lancet windows is clear and wavy, interestingly; the St. Mary Catholic Church has never had stained glass in any of its external lancet windows. The original building had two sections added on to the back in the 1930s. One add-on section was used as living quarters for the priest, which includes a living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and a safe and storage room. The other section was an automobile parking garage for the priest. The front (west) side of the building includes a concrete porch (which replaced the original wood porch) that measures 12 feet wide by 5 feet long with four steps and right and left side round metal hand railings. Two four-paneled solid wood entrance doors with semi-circular tops, hinged to swing outward, lead the way into the church building. The porch includes two wood sitting benches and has a wood framed canopy roof with asphalt shingles that match the building's main roof. Wood pillars support the canopy roof and the fascia includes vertical jig-sawn wood trim fretwork supported by wood braces attached at a 45-degree angle. A sign on the left side of the entrance doors reads, ‚ÄúSt. Mary‚Äôs Church ‚Äì Built by a Group of Polish Immigrants in 1914.‚Äù There is one centrally located lancet window above the canopy. The bottom section has two vertical panes that are painted white, and the top section has three lancet shaped panes with clear wavy glass. The right (south) side of the building includes three lancet windows in the original front section. Each of these windows has four vertical clear wavy glass panes in their bottom section, and two vertical panes and three lancet shaped panes with clear wavy glass in their top section. The rear add-on section of the right side includes three double hung windows with clear flat glass panes. The left (north) side of the building includes four lancet windows in the original front section. Each of these windows has four vertical clear wavy glass panes in their bottom section, and two vertical panes and three lancet shaped panes with clear wavy glass in their top section. The rear add-on automobile garage section, on the northeastern corner of the building, includes two hinged swing-out wood garage doors with four panels each. The back (east) side of the building includes a single wood rear entrance access door with a five-step concrete porch and wood handrail. There are three double hung windows (which are now covered with wood panels), and three double pane vertical windows in the garage section (which are now covered with wood panels). A wood framed canopy roof supported by two wood braces attached at a 45-degree angle extends the length of the three windows and entrance door and is covered with asphalt shingles that match the building's main roof. A vertical entrance space above the canopy roof has a hinged wood door that allows access into the attic space. A single air vent is installed near the peak of the roof in the original section of the building. The wood framed gable roof on the original and add-on sections of the building are covered with matching asphalt shingles. Modern aluminum downspouts are installed on several areas around the building and gutters run the length of the roof. The steeple is located at the front (west) side of the building and includes four wood window openings with louvered air vents that have arrow point tops. The steeple's roof is covered with asphalt shingles that match the building's main roof. A Christian cross that is made from wood and finished with copper sheeting is affixed to the steeple's apex. A bell is installed inside the steeple that can be rung manually.Jaye, Randy. Flagler County, Florida: A Centennial History. Booklocker.com, 2017.

The Shrine of Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, was built in 1935 by Rev. Fr. Cornelius Hoffman, a missionary who had studied theology in Poland. It is located on property to the left (north) side of the St. Mary Catholic Church. The Shrine's base measures 28 feet by 40 feet and is 24 feet high. The Shrine was a gift to Korona and is a rest stop for motorists who can visit the shrine and pray to the Patron Saint of Travelers. Since the 1960s, the St. Mary Catholic Church performs special services called the Blessing of Automobiles where motorists are invited to have their cars blessed in front of the Shrine of Saint Christopher. The shrine has an altar on its west side that includes the following inscription: ‚ÄúLet us invoke god‚Äôs blessing on our visitors as they journey on their way along ways of peace and prosperity. May the almighty and merciful god lead them, and may the angel Raphael and St. Christopher accompany them on their journey. So they in peace, health, and joy, return unto their own.‚ÄùThird Annual Car Blessing Apr. 13 at Korona.‚Äù Flagler Tribune. April 3, 1969. History of Korona, Florida Rev. Michael Curley, bishop of St. Augustine, purchased land for $1.00 in the center of Korona and this was where a Catholic church building would be constructed. The church building was originally named St. Mary, Queen of Poland, Catholic Church, but later changed its name to St. Mary Catholic Church. This church immediately became the heart of the community, and is still an important symbol of the community of Korona. Upon arriving in Korona the Polish families began building homes and farms in addition to their church. Since 1955, Korona has been part of the Bunnell post office service area. The area's rugged wilderness, which included dense woodlands, heavy soil, insects, poor drainage and lack of reliable road transportation, other than the railroad, led to crop failures and difficulty transporting harvests to shipping centers. By 1922, automobile transportation was improved as the Dixie Highway reached Korona. And, by the 1930s, U.S. Highway 1 was running through Korona. These roads made traveling to and from Korona, by way of automobiles, much easier and allowed access to many more areas that were not serviced by the railroads. In 1926, Barney Trojanowski built the White Eagle Hotel. The first floor of the hotel was used as a grocery and feed store as well as a real estate office. The second floor had the family and patron rooms. The building was used as a social and recreation facility, and included a beer garden (after the repeal of Prohibition in 1934) and large dance floor in addition to being a hotel for many years. Many festivals and special events, including St. Mary Catholic Church sponsored events, were hosted here. In 1959, the White Eagle Hotel building was demolished to make room for the widening to four lanes of the U.S. Highway. In 1935, the Shrine of St. Christopher was built by the flamboyant and charismatic Rev. Fr. Cornelius Hoffman, as a gift to Korona. Many community and church-related events have taken place at this shrine including the popular Blessing of the Automobiles. Since its construction, this shrine has brought many travelers to Korona, and is still a popular stop for motorists.\\" In 1940, infrastructure in Korona dramatically improved when electric service was connected to the area. Suddenly, the rural area of Korona had the means to improve its standard of living and expedite the modern development of the community. As the Korona community continued to grow during the 20th century, the original St. Mary Catholic Church became too small for its parish. A new St. Mary Catholic Church was constructed and it was dedicated on October 8, 1994. This larger church can accommodate up to 500 people, including Polish- speaking parishioners who travel from communities many miles from Korona. In 2011, a new Parish Center was constructed on the St. Mary Catholic Church property, which includes classrooms, offices and a social hall. In 2014, the St. Vincent DePaul Thrift was constructed on the St. Mary Catholic Church property, which provides affordable clothing and house wares to the needy of Korona and nearby communities.

Background  A combined sewer system is a sewer system that is designed to carry both wastewater and stormwater. In the United States, there are around 860 communities with combined sewer systems, totaling to a population of around 40 million people served.(December 20, 2017). https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflow-frequent- questions Environmental Protection Agency During normal operation of a combined sewer system, the sewage from commercial, industrial, and residential sources flow into the combined system. Water from surface runoff and storm drains join the sewer flow and the combined water and sewage travel to a treatment plant. This is normally not too much of a problem as long as the infrastructure can handle the flow. The issues arise when there is an excess of stormwater. When there is an excess of stormwater, the combined sewer is no longer able to handle the flow and it backs up and drains, usually into the nearest body of water. Providence, Rhode Island is a place that has had a particular issue when it came to the effects of its combined sewer system.

This overflow contained many pollutants that heavily polluted many parts of the Narraganset Bay. This caused many areas to be considered a health risk. This caused there to be certain areas that are permanently closed to shellfishing and over 11,000 acres that would be closed when there was more than an inch of rainfall.  History  In March of 1993, the Narragansett Bay Commission approved a comprehensive Combined Sewer Overflow Abatement Program. This three-part plan proposed the construction of seven underground storage facilities and three deep rock tunnel segments. The proposed cost, adjusted for inflation, was $844 million dollars. The plan was eventually approved in 2001, with Phase I completed in 2008. The completion of Phase I diverted around 1.1 billion gallons to a treatment facility at Fields Point. The Phase II facilities were completed in 2014. Due to the high cost of the project, costing around $1.5 billion there was a reevaluation of the project in 2013 with final approval for continuation of Phase III, with additional federal funding in 2019. Since the construction of Phase I and II, the system is able to capture around 60% of the stormwater that passes through the system.Kuffner, Alex (September 20, 2019).https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190920/269-million-loan-from- epa-will-help-complete-project-to-stop-tainted-water-from-running-into- narragansett-bay Providence Journal Additionally, it has captured around 11 billion gallons of untreated stormwater. Due to this improvement, the bacteria levels in the Narragansett have dropped by around 50%. The Providence Combined Sewer Overflow Abatement Program is the largest public-works project in Rhode Island History and is working to make the Narragansett Bay cleaner and healthier.

It is a mark that indicates the mono-methylation at the 20th lysine residue of the histone H4 protein. This mark can be di- and tri-methylated. It is critical for genome integrity including DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. H4K20me2 is the most common methylation state on histone H4 and was one of the earliest modified histone residues to be identified back in pea and calf extracts in 1969. It is also the only identified methylated lysine residue on the H4 histone. Each degree of methylation at H4K20 has a very different cellular process. The loss of H4K20me3 along with a reduction of H4K16ac is a strong indicator of cancer. Nomenclature H4K20me indicates monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 protein subunit: {  Abbr. Meaning - H4 H4 family of histones - K standard abbreviation for lysine - 20 position of amino acid residue (counting from N-terminus) - me methyl group - 1 number of methyl groups added } Lysine Methylation Methylation-lysine This diagram shows the progressive methylation of a lysine residue. The mono-methylation denotes the methylation present in H4K20me. H4K20me exists in three distinct states as mono-, di- and trimethylation. H4K20me1 H4K20me1 is associated with transcriptional activation. H4K20me2 H4K20me2 is similar to H4K20me1 but has a different distribution and this dimethylation controls the cell cycle and DNA damage response. H4K20me3 H4K20me3 is very different. H4K20me3 represses transcription when present at promoters. H4K20me3 also silences repetitive DNA and transposons. The loss of H4K20me3 defines cancer along with a reduction of H4K16ac. H4K20me3 is involved in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome where patients have premature and very rapid aging caused by de novo mutations that occurs in a gene that encodes lamin A. Lamin A is made but isn't processed properly. This poor processing creates a really abnormal nuclear morphology and disorganized heterochromatin. Patients also don't have appropriate DNA repair, and they also have increased genomic instability. Cancer marker The loss of the repressive H4K20me3 mark defines cancer along with a reduction of activating H4K16ac mark. It is not clear how the loss of a repressive and an activating mark is an indicator of cancer. It is not clear exactly how but this reduction happens at repetitive sequences along with general reduced DNA methylation. Histone modifications The genomic DNA of eukaryotic cells is wrapped around special protein molecules known as histones. The complexes formed by the looping of the DNA are known as chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome: this consists of the core octamer of histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) as well as a linker histone and about 180 base pairs of DNA. These core histones are rich in lysine and arginine residues. The carboxyl (C) terminal end of these histones contribute to histone-histone interactions, as well as histone-DNA interactions. The amino (N) terminal charged tails are the site of the post- translational modifications, such as the one seen in H3K36me3. Epigenetic implications The post-translational modification of histone tails by either histone modifying complexes or chromatin remodelling complexes are interpreted by the cell and lead to complex, combinatorial transcriptional output. It is thought that a Histone code dictates the expression of genes by a complex interaction between the histones in a particular region. The current understanding and interpretation of histones comes from two large scale projects: ENCODE and the Epigenomic roadmap. The purpose of the epigenomic study was to investigate epigenetic changes across the entire genome. This led to chromatin states which define genomic regions by grouping the interactions of different proteins and/or histone modifications together. Chromatin states were investigated in Drosophila cells by looking at the binding location of proteins in the genome. Use of ChIP-sequencing revealed regions in the genome characterised by different banding. Different developmental stages were profiled in Drosophila as well, an emphasis was placed on histone modification relevance. A look in to the data obtained led to the definition of chromatin states based on histone modifications. The human genome was annotated with chromatin states. These annotated states can be used as new ways to annotate a genome independently of the underlying genome sequence. This independence from the DNA sequence enforces the epigenetic nature of histone modifications. Chromatin states are also useful in identifying regulatory elements that have no defined sequence, such as enhancers. This additional level of annotation allows for a deeper understanding of cell specific gene regulation. History H4K20 was one of the earliest modified histone residues to be identified back in pea and calf extracts in 1969. Genome integrity H4K20me is important for DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. There are a set of H4K20-specific histone methyltransferases (SET8/PR-Set7, SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2). Without these enzymes there is a disruption of genomic instability. Methods The histone mark H4K20me can be detected in a variety of ways: 1\\\\. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP- sequencing) measures the amount of DNA enrichment once bound to a targeted protein and immunoprecipitated. It results in good optimization and is used in vivo to reveal DNA-protein binding occurring in cells. ChIP-Seq can be used to identify and quantify various DNA fragments for different histone modifications along a genomic region. 2\\\\. Micrococcal Nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq) is used to investigate regions that are bound by well positioned nucleosomes. Use of the micrococcal nuclease enzyme is employed to identify nucleosome positioning. Well positioned nucleosomes are seen to have enrichment of sequences. 3\\\\. Assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is used to look in to regions that are nucleosome free (open chromatin). It uses hyperactive Tn5 transposon to highlight nucleosome localisation.

Cynthia Ellen Harrison (born October 1946) is a historian who taught at George Washington University. Harrison participated in activism that led to the Equal Credit Act of 1974 and is an advocate for gender equality.  Early life  Cynthia Ellen Harrison was born in October 1946 in Brooklyn, New York. She grew up and attended public schools in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents names were Herbert Harrison and Jean Hacken Harrison. Harrison was married 1970 and divorced in 1984. After, she had a long-term relationship with another man. Harrison has no children. She became an activist feminist in 1970, when she moved to Canada. She has lived in Washington, D.C. since 1975.  Education  Harrison received her Bachelor's degree (B.A.) in June, 1966 at Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, N.Y. Her degree she graduated with was in American Literature. She went on to get her Master's degree (M.S.) in Library Service. She achieved this in August, 1967 at Columbia University, New York N.Y. Harrison received her Doctorate degree (Ph.D) in American History in May, 1982. This degree was at Columbia University as well.  Career  Harrison's first job from September 1967 to July 1970 was working for the Brooklyn Public Library in a library in Brooklyn, New York, initially the \\"Rugby Branch\\" and a year later in the \\"telephone reference division.\\" Then, from September 1970 to May 1972, Harrison was an Assistant Head Librarian in the reference department at McMaster University Library, Ontario, Canada. She was an instructor at Columbia University in New York, N.Y. In the summer of 1976 she led the \\"Eurocentre program\\". In the summer of 1977 she led an American history survey on pre-Civil War. Harrison was a Research Fellow at The Brookings Institution from August 1979 until August 1982. Harrison was in the American Historical Association/American Political Science Association. She was a Deputy Director in Project '87 from August 1982 to April 1988. At the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C., Harrison was Chief of Federal Judicial History Office from April 1988 to December 1994. Her special projects include; Supreme Court Justices' oral history interviews and Gender Issues Coordinator; liaison with courts and allied organizations concerning programs on gender fairness education. In 1994 to 1996 Harrison was a part of the Columbian School Student Appeals Committee. From 1996 to 1999, she was part of the By-laws Committee. In 1998 she was in the CSAS Hiring Oversight Committee. Harrison was in the CSAS Dean's Council from 1998 to 2001. Harrison was a part of the GWIPP Steering Committee from 1998 to 2003. In 2001 to 2003 she was in the Faculty Senate Committee on Professional Ethics and Academic Freedom. She was Chair in the EMMA/NWPC awards committee in 2003. From 2003 to 2004, Harrison was in the MPP Program Committee. From 2003 to 2005 she was on the Committee on the Status of Women Faculty and Librarians. In 2005 she was part of CCAS Committee on Graduate Studies. Harrison taught for many years at George Washington University. She is currently Emeritus Faculty, which labels her as retired. The classes that she taught were; \\"Women in the United States: 1865 to Present\\", \\"U.S. Constitutional History\\", and \\"Readings on Women in American History\\". Her teaching field also includes; \\"U.S. women‚Äôs history; U.S. Constitutional history; women and public policy; women and the law; women and welfare policy\\". While working at the George Washington University she had many professional experiences.Along with all of the classes she taught at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., she was also a GW/IWPR Fellowship coordinator. \\"She also served for three terms on the DC Commission for Women\\"  Activism  She played a role in the Equal Credit Act of 1974. The law was enacted the 28th of October, 1974. The law \\"made it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act\\".  Equal Credit Act  Cynthia Harrison was employed full time and her husband, at the time, was a full time graduate student. During this time, credit card companies would routinely deny single women the ability to have a credit card. Men needed to be cosigners for the married women to gain access to a credit card. So, she had to fight with banks and stores to credit her own name. Harrison had been denied many times for credit cards until she applied under the name of \\"C. Harrison\\", which then she was granted a credit card. The reason she was able to gain access to a credit card is because the name she applied under wasn't believed to be a woman's name. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 helped change that problem of women being discriminated against. \\"The ECOA sought to address practices that made it difficult for women, particularly married and formerly married women, to obtain credit.\\"  Welfare Reform  In 1996, Bill Clinton made a program that supported poor families, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Harrison and a large group of feminists formed an organization they called the \\"Women's Committee of 100.\\" The organization they created advocated enhancing, not destroying, the program that was made. The program is now called \\"Temporary Assistance to Needy Families\\" and it removes federal oversight of state programs designed to help poor children and their caregivers. Harrison tried to raise a dissenting voice to this program.  Professional Associations  Harrison was a part of these associations; * American Historical Association * Organization of American Historians * American Political Science Association * Coordinating Council for Women in History.  Works Published  Harrison wrote a book of her own called \\"On Account Of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945-1968.\\"Cynthia Harrison feminist documents collection, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University. In this book she goes into depth about the political activities between the mid 1940s and mid 1960s. The time frame fell when the women gained the vote to when the women's movement was brought back. This book highlights women's history and their journey. She also had reference works called \\"Women's Movement Media; A Source Guide\\", published in 1975 and \\"Women In American History\\", which was published in 1979. Harrison helped publish 17 articles about a variety of topics in Women's History.

Nicknamed The Parking Rapist, he prowled mainly at night, attacking women in underground car parks under the threat of a knife, before raping them. Patrick Tr√©meau was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment in 1998. He was released in May 2005 after 10 years of detention, whereupon he reoffends, for which he was arrested in September of that same year. At the same time, a law was passed concerning recidivism, and Tr√©meau was given 20 years' imprisonment with a 10-year imprisonment term in February 2009.  Biography  Patrick Tr√©meau came from a poor family, with two other children. He lived with his mother Janine, a housekeeper, in the city of Hautes- Mardelles in Brunoy, Essonne.\\"The relatives of the 'Parking Rapist' are in shock\\" Article by Sandrine Binet and Jean-Marc Ducos, published on September 26, 2005, in Le Parisien He did not know his father, and later claimed that his father-in-law hit and abused him. Patrick was handed over to various different homes from a very young age, with his mother describing him as \\"the devil's envoy\\". Despite being unstable, suffering from nervous disorders and failing academically, Tr√©meau was nevertheless considered friendly and talented with manual labor. In the early 1980s, he earned a plumbing certificate, finding work easily, and doing in a manner considered satisfactory by his employers.  Early crimes  In 1984, Tr√©meau was arrested for masturbating in front of a hitchhiker. He was handed a 18-month sentence in prison, 10 of which were suspended for indecent assault. He was released after serving the sentence. In 1987, he raped a woman in Cr√©teil. For this crime, he was given a 7-year sentence by the Assize Court of Val-de- Marne, for rape under the threat of a weapon. In 1990, Tr√©meau was released from prison, and was hired as a storekeeper at a hardware store. His behavior towards his female colleagues was not abnormal, with Patrick successfully seducing several of them, but they quickly left him, which greatly affected Tr√©meau, who couldn't stand break-ups. Everything went well until 1992, where he made several suicide attempts because of break-ups, before abruptly quitting his job.  Rapes from 1993 to 1995  Between April 1993 and March 1995, Tr√©meau raped 8 women and tried to violate 5 others, always in the same manner.\\"A repeat rapist arrested in Paris\\" Article from September 25, 2005 on LCI His victims were all women, from 20 to 35 years, with long hair (primarily brunettes), always with a job that made them return late at night. When he spotted a victim, Tr√©meau followed them to the building and usually waited for them to come back and park their car in the parking lot. Afterwards, he threatened them with a knife and raped them in the dark, where he couldn't be seen. His assaults always took place between midnight and 4 a.m., in the underground car parks of the 11th and 20th arrondissements of Paris. At the beginning of the aggressions, he would always be menacing, but once the victim subjected, his behavior changed radically and his words became soft, with him embracing and even complimenting the victim.\\"Tr√©meau, the 'soft-spoken' rapist\\" Article by d'Ondine Millot published on February 6, 2009 on Lib√©ration When he raped, he always used a condom, and would sometimes throw the wrapper on the crime scene, without leaving fingerprints. In March 1995, he raped a woman almost every week. The police investigation was very difficult, because there was no exploitable index, and the composite sketches were imprecise. At the same time, in the eastern sector of Paris, there was another predator raging: Guy Georges. Some of Georges' crimes also took place in underground car parks. For a while, the police believed that this was the work of a single individual, but only after arresting Guy did they realise that there were two different perpetrators, operating in the same geographical area. Patrick Tr√©meau was arrested in March 1995, for breaking cars in a parking lot. At the police station, during his interrogation, a policeman noticed that he was trying to get rid of an empty condom wrapper. At the same time during the interview, Tr√©meau's last victim, Gladys, was filing a rape complaint. She mentioned that she very well saw that her rapist wore yellow shoes, a detail which caught the attention of Commandant Bertrand, who noticed that Patrick Tr√©meau also wore yellow shoes. Officers then made him take off his shoes and brought them to the office, where Gladys was, and she immediately recognized them. The police conducted a lineup, and among the group of men, through a beam splitter, Gladys immediately pointed to her rapist: Patrick Tr√©meau. She identified him because she remembered his gaze. Subsequently, the other victims of Tr√©meau also identified him, some managing to do it only by hearing his voice. Patrick Tr√©meau almost instantly confessed to all the rapes he committed while in custody, but denied having threatened the women with a knife.  Trial and sentence  The trial began in October 1998, to almost total indifference: no journalist as present to cover the event, despite the high number of victims (13). The last of said victims was not informed about the holding of the trial and, thus, could be a civil party. After the trial, Tr√©meau was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment, together with a minimum sentence of 8 years.  Detention and release  In the years following his conviction, Patrick Tr√©meau repeatedly asked for early release, to no avail. On May 7, 2005, after spending 10 years in prison, he was released from the prison in Melun, near the end of the sentence. He was put on parole, but without any obligation to report his to a social worker.  Recidivism and arrest  On June 5, 2005, a 24-year-old woman named Cecilia was attacked and raped in the garbage room of her apartment building, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. On June 20, another young woman was attacked in her building on Thionville Street, in the 19th arrondissement (the circumstances of this attack remain unclear), and finally, a third victim was assaulted on September 17, 2005.\\"The terrible story of a victim of the 'Parking Rapist'\\" Article published on February 5, 2009 in Le Parisien The Judicial Police of Paris, who were in charge of these rape cases, came to the certainty that these women had been attacked by the same rapist that plagued the city 10 years earlier: Patrick Tr√©meau. Two inspectors went to his mother's home, finding him there. Arrested, Patrick made a tearful confession, but denied raping Cecilia, the first victim.

It was released on November 22, 2019 as a single to promote Merry Liddle Christmas, a holiday film in which Rowland stars in. The song was written by Rowland, Nash Overstreet, Angela Beyince and Shane Stevens, while it was produced by Overstreet. Release and composition Rowland first announced the song on Twitter, posting on November 15 that the song was available for pre-order and also shared a teaser via Instagram. \\"Love You More at Christmas Time\\" was then released the next week and became available on all platforms on November 22, 2019. It is the first original content and her third musical effort under the Christmas music genre overall as a soloist after her \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" solo from the Destiny's Child album 8 Days of Christmas (in 2001) and her cover of \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\" for the soundtrack to A Madea Christmas (in 2013). Rowland co-wrote \\"Love You More at Christmas Time\\" with Nash Overstreet, Angela Beyince and Shane Stevens. \\"Love You More at Christmas Time\\" runs for 3 minutes and 25 seconds. The song is a \\"mid-tempo\\" Christmas song featuring an upbeat acoustic guitar, jingle bells and lyrics about all the things that make the holidays special, including mistletoe and quality time with loved ones. Critical reception Idolator's Mike Wass called it \\"cute, festive and loveable\\", and observed that \\"the seasonal bop has very genuine and rhythmic elements\\". Gil Kaufman from Billboard said that \\"Rowland imbues her new Christmas single with the spirit of Destiny Child's classic 8 Days of Christmas, swooningly delivering lines like 'Baby I believe in dreams/ And the joy the season brings/ You and me.'\\" D-Money of Soul Bounce wrote: \\"The track has everything you'd expect from a Christmas song. Sleigh bells ring, snow and hot cocoa are mentioned, as is mistletoe and sitting with your boo by the fireside. However traditional the lyrics are, Kelly makes sure to keep things modern thanks to the slick R&B; production. Guitar leads the way on the song, with warm bass, handclaps and finger snaps ushering in the soul of the season. Meanwhile, Kelly keeps things cozy with a mostly subdued vocal as the lyrics paint a vivid picture of holiday love.\\" Live performances Rowland performed the song live at the 2019 Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade.

The Philippines have had a long legacy of Spanish colonization of over 300 years. To begin to understand the archaeology of the Philippines, colonization by the Spanish must be factored in and understood. As Carl Guthe puts, as he excavated the Philippines during the 1920s, \\"The Filipinos have been under Christian influence for such a long period that all recollection of pre-Spanish inhumations has passed.\\" Thus, linking the past and present through Philippine archaeology can be an issue when it comes to understanding artifacts from before Spanish colonization. In addition to Spanish Colonization, the Philippines have also suffered in more recent history from American colonization that still persists to this day. On December 10, 1898, Spain surrendered the Philippines to the United States through the Treaty of Paris. This began a long period of American colonization, which played a huge role in Philippine archaeology as it enabled American anthropologists to explore vast archaeological sites with profound evidence of human occupation and evolution. Later, archaeologists like H. Otley Beyer were able to put the Philippines in the archaeological record through events such as the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, which initiated the development of archaeology in the Philippines.  Significant figures in Philippine archaeology   H. Otley Beyer  H. Otley Beyer was a cultural anthropologist and archaeologist who founded Philippine archaeology and became head of anthropology at the University of the Philippines. His Waves of Migration Theory relied on phenotypic and linguistic variability. He explained how he believed that people migrated into the Philippines in \\"waves,\\" with each wave getting lighter in skin color and more culturally sophisticated. Beyer's theory showed the first wave as the negritos (25,000‚Äì30,000 YBP), the second wave as the Indonesians (5,000‚Äì6,000 YBP), and the third wave as the Malayas (2,500 YBP). Beyer conducted archaeological surveys in Luzon, Palawan, and the Visayan Islands and suggested that terraces were constructed as early as 2000 years ago.  Robert Fox  Robert Bradford Fox was an anthropologist and leading historian of the pre-Hispanic Philippines. He led excavations in 1958 at Calatagan, Batangas, where he found 505 graves in two sites. Fox also became the head of the Anthropology Division at the National Museum of the Philippines, where he led a research project in Palawan from 1962 to 1966. Fox later delivered the only Pleistocene human fossils found in the Philippines through his excavations at the Tabon Cave complex.  Wilhelm G. Solheim II  Wilhelm Solheim conducted the first archaeological excavations in the Philippines after World War II. His fieldwork was mostly conducted in mainland and island Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific Islands. Solheim was a professor of Anthropology at the University of Hawaii from 1967 to 1991.  Stephen Acabado  Stephen Acabado is an anthropology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Acabado researches the relationships among Southeast Asian agricultural complexes, landscapes, and society. He has led research projects focusing on Ifugao, such as his Ifugao Archaeological Project.  Traditional comparative chronologies   The Three-Age System  The Three-Age System is a common periodization system that divides history into the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. These periods have been used throughout European archaeology to label artifacts into recognizable chronology. Despite this periodization being common in archaeology elsewhere, the Philippines has adopted various comparative chronologies that more accurately and efficiently categorize artifacts throughout history.  Comparative chronologies according to Victor Paz   Pre-archaeology: 19th century  According to Victor Paz, the Pre- Archaeology period is the longest among the five identified periods. As the name suggests, it is characterized as a time before archaeology as a discipline evolved. During this period, there was no evidence that antique material culture had any value. The exact dates of the pre-archaeology period are still debated, due to the discovery of human burial sites containing associated objects that demonstrate value.  Accidental Archaeology: 19th century to early 1920s  The Accidental Archaeology period is characterized by the beginnings of an antiquarian appreciation of the past regarding material goods. In this period, archaeology is still not quite a science, but rather served a purpose for other research pursuits that belonged in ethnographic and natural sciences. French naturalist Alfred Marche is the most prominent figure during this time and usually credited with being the first to conduct archaeological explorations and collect Philippine cultural goods. Marche collected not just for an antiquarian appreciation, but for a vested interest in exoticism. In 1881, he excavated human remains in the open sites in Marinduque and Catanduanes. He also found a number of other artifacts such as Chinese pottery, gold, wooden coffins, and burial urns. These artifacts were collected for museums in France. Other examples belonging to this period are the few educated elite Filipinos such as Pardo de Tavera and the Calderon family, who started private collections in Manila.  Committed Archaeology: 1920s to mid 1960s  During the Committed Archaeology period, the National Museum of the Philippines made more serious attempts at directed archaeological research, uncovering information about settlement patterns, burial practices, and artifact assemblage. The Three-Age System was adopted during this period as the primary way to categorize archaeological findings, following an evolutionary approach that linked artifacts to the progression of human culture from \\"savagery\\" to \\"civilization.\\"  Directed Archaeology: mid-1960s to late 1990s  The Directed Archaeology period saw the development of contemporary worldwide archaeological ethics standards, which disengaged archaeological research from its antiquarian origins, especially in regards to looting. There was also an increase in state support of archaeology practices and research projects, enabled by the strengthening of the National Museum of the Philippines via protective laws and an increase in resources. Research projects were led by private individuals and academic institutions in collaboration with the museum and resulted in the global interest of the Philippines.  Reflective Archaeology: late 1990s to present  The current period of archaeology is the Reflective Period, which articulates the ethics of archaeology, emphasizing respect for \\"private property\\" and an increase in state and private institutional support of archaeological research. Reflective Archaeology uses a multidisciplinary approach to answer research questions regarding origin, migration, trade patterns, and domestication practices of the Philippines. Archaeology today focuses on rewriting the colonial narratives that dominate the discipline, encouraging community involvement and the preservation of Filipino heritage.  Comparative chronologies according to F. Landa Jocano  According to F. Landa Jocano, the comparative chronologies of history of the archaeology of the Philippines consisted of the Mythic Phase, Formative Phase, Incipient Phase, Emergent Phase, and Baranganic Phase (Jocano, 2001).  Mythic Phase  The Mythic Phase is from the beginning of time and focuses on the emphasis of myths as a source of creative information from previous generations including symbols that corresponds to religious beliefs, social practices, and political power. In the Philippines, this emphasis focused on two creation myths. The first focuses on the Yliguynes and their two gods, Captan and Maguayen. The second focuses on the Tinguines, who believed that in the beginning that there was only the sea and the sky. Jocano emphasizes how these myths reflect prehistoric Filipino culture as well as imagination and ancient thinking regarding human origin. Jocano shows the importance of acknowledging myths to further understand the \\"emergence and development of our prehistory culture\\" (Jocano, 2001, p. 102).  Formative Phase  The Formative Phase symbolizes cultural development from ca. 50,000 to 500 BC. Within this phase, the emergence of new archaeological artifacts such as the first human fossils in the Tabon Cave emphasizes human migration to the Philippines. Artifacts found from this phase support the idea that there was a developing culture in the region, which was capable of adapting to their environment. These types of artifacts showed that there were stone-tool, ceramic, and other economic industries that enabled tasks such as foraging, gathering, hunting, fishing, and horticulture. Jocano shows the true importance of this phase as it exemplified the unfolding of life and culture through the development of the stone tool and ceramic industries.  Incipient Phase  The Incipient Phase further emphasizes cultural development after the Formative Phase from ca. 500 BC to the first millennium AD. Throughout this phase, radical advancements within Filipino culture began to develop, with the emergence of effective agriculture and manufacturing to develop large societies. The appearance of metals allowed for better tools and nicer cultural objects such as beads, which allowed for stratification of class within society. Jocano further emphasizes the advancements made in the ceramic industry, which led to progress in trade and the eventual use of jar burials in the Philippines. The Incipient Phase was filled with the development of technology that allowed for Filipinos to adapt to their environment effectively, which further enhanced their culture and survival.  Emergent Phase  The Emergent Phase also emphasizes cultural development from the 1st century AD to the 14th century. In this phase, social and economic improvement appeared with the domestication of plants and animals, which allowed for expanded trade, communities, and population growth. Jocano explains how community growth, writing, political decentralization, and foreign trade allowed for social organization and better-developed culture during the prehistoric Philippines.  Baranganic Phase  The Baranganic Phase highlights the last period of cultural development from around the 14th century to the 16th century. The Barangay consisted of \\"the smallest sociopolitical unit of pre-colonial Philippine society,\\" and exemplified the development of social stratification and complex economy (Jocano, 2001, p. 154). Within this period, accounts from Spanish Friars provided vast information of written records that allow people like Jocano to argue that this ancient Filipino society was incredibly complex, despite foreign powers, and greatly influenced how civilization is maintained today in the Philippines.  Comparative chronologies according to Laure Lee Junker  Another comparative chronology of archaeology in the Philippines is the Bais/Tanjay Regional Chronology of Laure Lee Junker. Junker dissects her chronology into the following seven phases: the Edjek Phase, the Solamillo Phase, the Aguilar Phase, the Santiago Phase, the Osmena Phase, the Spanish Phase, and the Historic Phase.  The Edjek Phase  The Edjek Phase was ca. 2000‚Äì1500 B.C. This period in traditional chronology would be represented as the Neolithic Age.  The Solamillo Phase  The Solamillo Phase was ca. A.D. 0‚Äì500. This period in traditional chronology would be represented as the Iron Age, or Metal Age according to the long history model.  The Aguilar Phase  The Aguilar Phase was ca. A.D. 500‚Äì1000.  The Santiago Phase  The Santiago Phase was ca. A.D. 1100‚Äì1400.  The Osmena Phase  The Osmena Phase was ca. A.D. 1400‚Äì1600.  The Spanish Phase  The Spanish Phase was ca. A.D. 1600‚Äì1900.  The Historic Phase  The Historic Phase was from ca. A.D. 1600 to the present.  Current archaeology  Much more research is needed to understand the latest period of Philippine archaeology. Current research focuses on rewriting colonial narratives and conserving Filipino heritage.  The National Museum of the Philippines  The mission of the National Museum of the Philippines is \\"to acquire, document, preserve, exhibit, and foster scholarly study and appreciation of works of art, specimens, and cultural and historical artifacts.\\" The museum divisions include Anthropology, Archaeology, Cultural Properties, and Museum Education. The Archaeology division conducts research about the prehistory of the Philippines. The museum encourages community involvement by hosting events (music, art, science, workshops), teaching Filipino history by showcasing exhibits, and increasing awareness via newsletters and social media.  The Ifugao Archaeological Project  Stephen Acabado's Ifugao Archaeological Project is an example of a community archaeology project, which works with Ifugao communities to address archaeological issues regarding landscape and community formation. This project encourages community involvement to actively conserve heritage, working to date the Ifugao Rice Terraces and resolve colonial discourses regarding antiquity. Acabado uses archaeology to reveal factual evidence of originsa and colonial resistance to rewrite dominant narratives regarding Filipino origin, which are still currently based on Beyer's Waves of Migration theory.

The taxon cycle concept was explicitly formulated by biologist E. O. Wilson in 1961 after he surveyed the distributions, habitats, behavior and morphology of ant species in the Melanesian archipelago.  Stages of the taxon cycle  Wilson categorized species into evolutionary \\"stages\\", which today are commonly described in the outline by Ricklefs & Cox (1972). However, with the advent of molecular techniques to construct time-calibrated phylogenetic relationships between species, the taxon cycle concept was further developed to include well-defined temporal scales and combined with concepts from ecological succession and speciation cycle theories. Taxon cycles have mainly been described in island settings (archipelagos), where the distributions and movements of species are readily recognized, but may also occur in continental biota. * Stage I: Young, rapidly expanding, undifferentiated, widely and continuously distributed species in the initial colonization stage inhabiting small island, coastal or disturbed (marginal) habitat. Such species are hypothesized to include very good dispersers, ephemeral species and ecological \\"supertramps\\". * Stage II: Species that are generally widespread across many islands, but where geographical expansion has slowed, population differentiation has generated subspecies or incipient species, and local extinction on small islands may have created gaps in the distribution. This stage includes species that have maintained a relatively good dispersal ability such as \\"great speciators\\". Early-stage \\"species complexes\\" may consist of stage II species. * Stage III: Older, well-differentiated and well-defined species that have moved to habitats inland (and uphill) and where reduced dispersal ability and extinctions have fragmented the distribution to fewer and larger islands. These species may be niche specialists, but novel adaptations or accidental dispersal may restart the taxon cycle. * Stage IV: Old, relictual, endemic species in the \\"final\\" stage are restricted to island interiors (mountains) on a few, large islands. This stage includes sedentary high‚Äêelevation specialists with limited dispersal abilities and small range sizes. These species are evolutionary distinctive, as closely related species (and subspecies) have gone extinct. The ecology and evolution of the Melanesian ants that originally inspired Wilson's hypothesis have since been shown to be consistent with the taxon cycle predictions using modern methods. Ricklefs & Bermingham (2002) estimated that taxon cycles take place over periods of 0.1-10 million years in different bird groups of the Lesser Antilles islands. Pepke et al. (2019) used the difference in mean age of late- and early-stage species as a lower estimate (4.7 million years) of the tempo of taxon cycling in an Indo-Pacific bird family.

Crimes and investigation  Lassana Coulibaly, a delinquent from Aubervilliers, kidnapped and raped (or sexually assaulted) twelve women between the ages of 19 and 57, entering their homes mainly through an open window, sometimes through a roof, balcony or scaffolding. He got his nickname from the fact that he usually gagged his victims with a sock, also using cables and cord extensions found on site. The absence of fingerprints in the first cases suggested to the investigators that he always wore gloves when he attacked the women; it would eventually turn out that he used a pair of socks to cover his hands.  Trial and imprisonment  On May 23, 2008, Lassana Coulibaly was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for rape, attempted rape and sexual assault, as the court did not uphold torture and barbarity. After release, he would be put under socio-judicial services at least until he reaches the age of 60.

She showed promise as a juvenile in 2017 when she won the second of her two starts and went on to demonstrate high class form in the following year, winning the Atalanta Stakes and running third in both the Coronation Stakes and the Nassau Stakes. As a four-year-old in 2019 she recorded her biggest success when she took the Falmouth Stakes. Background Veracious is a bay filly with a small white star bred and owned by the Cheveley Park Stud. She was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Freemason Lodge Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was from the second crop of foals sired by Frankel, an undefeated racehorse whose other progeny have included Cracksman, Logician, Anapurna, Soul Stirring and Without Parole. Veracious's dam Infallible showed top-class form, winning the Nell Gwyn Stakes and finishing second in both the Coronation Stakes and the Falmouth Stakes and went on to be a successful broodmare who produced several other winners including Mutakayyef (Summer Mile Stakes). She was descended from the Kentucky-bred mare Some Romance, who won the Frizette Stakes and the Matron Stakes in 1989. Racing career 2017: two-year-old season Veracious made her racecourse debut on 22 September in a minor event over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in which she started the 3/1 favourite and finished third behind Magnolia Springs and Melodies. On 13 October the filly contested a maiden race over the same distance at Newmarket Racecourse and was made the 3/1 second choice in a twelve-runner field. Ridden as in her first outing by Ryan Moore she took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. 2018: three-year-old season After an absence of more than eight months, Veracious made a belated three-year-old debut in the Group 1 Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 22 June in which she was ridden by Frankie Dettori. Starting a 14/1 outsider she took the lead at half way and although she was overtaken by Alpha Centauri approaching the final furlong she kept on well to finish third of the twelve runners with Billesdon Brook, Clemmie and Teppal running behind. On 2 August the filly was moved up in distance for the ten-furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. With Dettori again in the saddle she ran third behind Wild Illusion and Urban Fox with Billesdon Brook in fourth and Rhododendron coming home last of the six runners. Veracious was partnered by Moore on 1 September when she was dropped back in class for the Group 3 Atalanta Stakes at Sandown Park and started the 10/11 favourite against five opponents. After racing in second place behind Awesometank she went to the front two furlongs out and won \\"readily\\" by a length and a quarter. After the race Moore said \\"She's a really nice filly, she's run well in two Group Ones and a stronger pace would have suited her better. I was in front earlier than I would have wanted, but she can only win and there was a bit left in the tank at the end. She's a very honest filly, she just doesn't do a whole lot when she gets to the front\\". On her final appearance of the year, Veracious contested the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket on 6 October. She was in contention for most of the way before fading in the closing stages and coming home sixth of the nine runners behind Laurens. 2019: four-year-old season On 5 May Veracious made her first appearance as a four-year-old in the Group 2 Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket in which she started the 5/4 favourite but finished fourth to Worth Waiting after looking to be outpaced in the final stages of the nine furlong contest. She was the beaten favourite again in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Epsom Racecourse on 1 June when she came home third behind Anna Nerium and Awesometank. Having been ridden by Moore on her first starts of the year she was partnered by Oisin Murphy when she finished fourth behind Move Swiftly in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot. Murphy was again in the saddle when Veracious contested the Group 1 Falmouth Stakes over one mile at Newmarket on 12 July and started the 6/1 fifth choice in a six-runner field. The Irish filly I Can Fly (runner-up in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes) started favourite with the other contenders being One Master, Qabala (Nell Gwyn Stakes), Beshaayir (Lanwades Stud Stakes) and Mot Juste (Oh So Sharp Stakes). In a change of tactics Veracious was sent into the lead from the start and was never headed, staying on well under pressure in the closing stages to win by a neck from One Master with I Can Fly almost three lengths back in third. Michael Stoute, who was winning the race for the sixth time, said \\"It was a very brave performance, and [Oisin Murphy] rode her beautifully. She ran very well at Ascot but was always doing a little too much, and we didn't want that again today. He let her flow, and she was game. She's taken a long time to really ripen, and, actually, Ryan Moore rode her a couple of weeks ago and said, 'She's there now.'\\" At Newmarket on 5 October Veracious made her second attempt to win the Sun Chariot Stakes. She recovered from a slow start to take the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken in the closing stages by Billesdon Brook and beaten one and a half lengths into second place. Two weeks later on her final run of the year the filly was matched against male opposition in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on heavy ground at Ascot. Ridden by Jason Watson, she led from the start and opened up a clear lead on her rivals before tiring in the last quarter mile and finishing fourth behind King of Change. 2020: five-year-old season After undergoing wind surgery, Veracious resumed her racing career after a 293-day break in the Dick Hern Fillies' Stakes at Haydock Park on 8 August. Starting the 11/10 favourite, Veracious always travelled strongly under jockey Ryan Moore. She picked up well to grab the lead and had enough in reserve to win by three-quarters of a length. Moore said after the race \\"I was happy with her. It was her first run for a while and she should come on for it. She did what she had to today.\\" Pedigree * Veracious was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Danzig, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

For example, a fair division setting with free disposal is a setting where some resources have to be divided fairly, but some of the resources may be left undivided, discarded or donated. Examples of situations with free disposal are allocation of food, clothes jewels etc. Examples of situations without free disposal are: * Chore division - since all chores must be done. * Allocation of land with an old structure - since the structure may have to be destructed, and destruction is costly. * Allocation of an old car - since the car may have to be carried away to used cars garage, and moving it may be costly. * Allocation of shares in a firm that may have debts - since the firm cannot be disposed of without paying its debts first. The free disposal assumption may be useful for several reasons: * It enables truthful cake-cutting algorithms: The option to discard some of the cake gives the players an incentive to reveal their true valuations. * It enables fast envy-free cake-cutting algorithms, and more economically-efficient envy-free allocations: Discarding some of the cake helps to reduce envy. *It enables online assignment algorithms.

Manik's garage stands just in front of a ladies hostel where Nithya (Sona) lives and Manik is in love with her. Raja and Nithya are collegemates and lovers. The morning, Nithya acts as a soft-spoken woman to the hostel warden and she leaves the hostels in a traditional dress which makes Manik falling in love with her. But then, she goes to her friend's house, changes her dress and goes to the college in modern dress. Nithya is also an outspoken and straightforward woman who hates male chauvinism. Manik decides to impress Nithya's father Shanmugam (Malaysia Vasudevan) who lives in a village and Manik helps him sorting out a case. Shanmugam then promises him to give his daughter in marriage and Nithya finally sees Manik at the engagement in her village. The day of the wedding, she elopes and arrives at Raja's home.

Manik then promises Nithya that he will not tell anything to Raja. Nithya doesn't want to be a typical housewife doing housework so she starts to behave harshly towards Raja's family. Raja tries his best to bear her arrogant behaviour and the situation worsens dramatically day by day. Manik then plays a double game: on the one hand, Manik advises his friend Raja to behave violently towards his wife and on the other hand, Manik blindly supports Nithya in her decisions. Three years later, Nithya and Raja live separately from each other and they are now busy with their professional career. To prove that the women are equal to men, Nithya asks Manik to marry her at the registrar office and invites Raja. The day of the marriage, Manik refuses to marry her and humiliates her.

It is the oldest and largest of Central Park's 22 playgrounds. Opened in 1926, Heckscher Playground is named for philanthropist August Heckscher. Initially, it faced opposition from groups who did not want a playground within the Central Park landscape, but the playground grew popular with middle- and working-class families after its opening. Its success soon led to the construction of additional playgrounds in Central Park. Heckscher Playground has been rebuilt several times, including in the 1930s and twice in the 1970s.  History   Planning  A design competition was held for Central Park in 1857; applicants were required to conform to several specifications, including at least three playgrounds of between . The winning plan, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's Greensward Plan, included a play area called the Children's District in the southern part of Central Park. This area included the original Ballplayers House and the Dairy, both built in the 1860s. However, the early design of Central Park encouraged exercise and \\"individual recreation\\" over team sports and games, and as such, playgrounds and recreational fields were not originally included within the park. By 1914, only nine percent of the parkland was devoted to sports uses. In April 1925, New York City park commissioner Francis D. Gallatin announced that on the west side of Central Park would be set aside for a play area funded by the philanthropist August Heckscher, who was providing the money through the Heckscher Foundation for Children. The play area would contain a wading pool, six ballfields, and a grove of trees. The plans immediately drew opposition from several parties, including those who wanted to preserve the passive landscape of Central Park, and several other opponents who called Heckscher's gift \\"a private memorial\\". Yet others said that the mere presence of a children's play area would cause the condition of Central Park to deteriorate. In response, Heckscher said that the Central Park playground would show the wealthy \\"an idea of what a modern playground should be\\", while another playground that he funded near Mulberry Bend in Chinatown, Manhattan, would serve the poorer communities there. That May, mayor John Francis Hylan ordered the construction of the playground, and the city's Board of Aldermen rejected an aldermanic resolution that opposed the playground and other Central Park \\"encroachments\\".  Use  Heckscher Playground opened near the southern end of Central Park on June 22, 1926. At the opening of his namesake playground, Heckscher announced that he would start a program to raise $3 million for Central Park improvements. His namesake playground quickly became popular with poor immigrant families. Most of the playground's users were lower- and middle-class families who came from further away. By 1933, Heckscher suggested the construction of additional playgrounds in Central Park. In 1934, work started on the extension of one of the park's bridle paths through the middle of Heckscher Playground. However, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses ordered that the bridle path's construction be halted that May. By 1935, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation announced that the playground would be renovated. Among the proposed improvements were the construction of additional athletic fields; the landscaping of the wading pool; planting of additional trees; and installation of extra play structures. A proposal to remove the Heckscher Ballfields and relocate all baseball games to the North Meadow was overturned. Additionally, August Heckscher paid for a $15,000 memorial to social reformer Sophie Irene Loeb, one of the earliest supporters for a playground in Central Park. The renovation was completed in 1936. To make way for the playground's expansion, a bridge called the Oval/Spur Rock Arch was destroyed in 1934, and the bridle path through the playground was cut off. In addition, under Moses's tenure as parks commissioner, twenty-one additional playgrounds were built in Central Park by the late 1930s. Heckscher Playground became popular not only among children, but also among adults who used the various facilities for exercise. Heckscher Playground was rebuilt again and reopened to the public in June 1970. At the time, the New York City Subway's 63rd Street lines were being built, with their planned routes running directly under the south side of Central Park. The city's parks commissioner, August Heckscher II (the grandson of the playground's namesake) expressed concern that the brand-new playground would have to be destroyed to make way for the excavation of the 63rd Street lines, located directly below the playground site. In early 1971, the subway system's operator New York City Transit Authority agreed to reduce construction time from three years to two years and construct a temporary playground nearby. When demolition of the playground commenced in August 1971, just fourteen months after its renovation, several people protested against the construction of the subway lines directly under the brand-new playground. Even so, work continued on the subway project. Richard Dattner designed the temporary play space, a $250,000 \\"water playground\\", which opened in 1973. The restored Heckscher Playground was reopened by 1977. The playground was renovated yet again in 2005. As part of the $3.5 million project, the adjacent restroom building was also restored. The work was completed in 2007.  Description  The Heckscher play area is located in the southern portion of Central Park, close to Central Park South between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue. The playground proper covers , excluding the adjacent ballfields. It is bounded by the 65th Street transverse road to the north, West Drive to the west and south, and Center Drive to the east. Nearby park features include Sheep Meadow to the north, across the 65th Street transverse; Central Park Carousel and the Chess & Checkers House to the northeast; and the Dairy and Wollman Rink to the east, across Center Drive. Columbus Circle is located to the southwest, across West Drive. Heckscher Playground consists of 14 swings, several slides, seesaws, a sandbox, and an open space made of artificial turf and rubber playground surfacing. In addition, it includes a large climbing structure with a water feature at the top, from which water flows downward into the climbing structure through a series of crevices. Spray jets for younger kids are located nearby. On the northern side of the playground, adjacent to the 65th Street transverse, there are six softball fields. Rat Rock, an outcrop of Manhattan schist popular among boulderers, is located just west of the play area and south of the softball fields. A set of brick-and- limestone restrooms is located east of Heckscher Playground. They were built with the original playground in the 1920s, expanded in the 1930s, and restored in the 2000s.

D√≠a de la Tradici√≥n (English: Tradition Day) is celebrated in Argentina on November 10, the birthday of Argentine poet Jos√© Hern√°ndez (1834-1886), who wrote, among others, the narrative poem El gaucho Mart√≠n Fierro and its continuation, La vuelta de Mart√≠n Fierro, stories in verse form of the experience of a gaucho, his lifestyle, customs, language, and codes of honor.  History  Francisco Timpone proposed the idea of the holiday on December 13, 1937, in a meeting of the association named Bases, an institution that paid tribute to Juan Bautista Alberdi and was based in La Plata, provincia de Buenos Aires. On June 6, 1938, the association presented a note to the Buenos Aires City Legislature requesting that they declare November 10 \\"D√≠a de la Tradici√≥n\\", for the birth on that date of Jos√© Hern√°ndez. The note proposed the civic pilgrimage to the Gaucho Ricardo G√ºiraldes Museum, in San Antonio de Areco, in homage and as an effective consecration of that day. The approval before the Chamber of Senators and Deputies was unanimous, declared under law No. 4756/39, promulgated on August 18, 1939, and published in the Official Gazette, coming into effect on September 9 of the same year. The aforementioned law originated in the Senate and its authors were D. Edgardo, J. M√≠guenz, and D. Atilio Roncoroni. The municipal mayors of La Plata and San Antonio de Areco ran the first celebration. Since 1940, La Plata held the party. La Agrupaci√≥n published a book every year, summarizing everything that happened. Law 10220/84 modified Article 3 of Law 4756/39, making it go on to say: The permanent provincial headquarters of tradition is declared to be the town of San Antonio de Areco. By National Law No. 21154 of 1975, the National Congress extended the validity of November 10 as ‚ÄúD√≠a de la Tradici√≥n‚Äù to the entire Argentine territory, fulfilling an unfinished aspiration of the Bases group, and declared City of Tradition as the city of San Mart√≠n, for being the hometown of Jos√© Hern√°ndez.

West retired on May 31, 2020. History The Church of the Epiphany Episcopal was established in 1985 when 15 congregation members from Truro Episcopal Church sought to establish a mission church in Western Fairfax County. Initial church services were held in Franklin Intermediate School. According to Epiphany Episcopal Church's history page, \\"Reverend B. Clifton Reardon, affectionately known as 'Father Bill,' was appointed vicar. After the first year, the Episcopal mission Church of the Epiphany was granted parish status and ground breaking for the church building took place on March 27, 1988; the first service was held in the building in February 1989.\\" Based on growing needs in the early 2000s, the Church of the Epiphany Episcopal congregation held a successful capital campaign titled 'Building on Christ's Cornerstone.' They mortgaged construction of a new Sanctuary and Nave (worship hall), a small chapel, classrooms and a Gathering Space in 2006, greatly increasing the building footprint to nearly 40,000 square feet. Starting after the 2003 General Convention of the Episcopal Church, discussions arose concerning appointment of \\"a gay priest recently elected a bishop and about whether same-gender relationships should be blessed.\\"https://episcopalchurch.org/library/article/what-consequences-will- decisions-have-domestic-and-overseas-mission Members of several Episcopal congregations in Virginia subsequently began to take issue with some of the decisions made at the 2003 General Convention.Fairfax Circuit Court document (http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1090682.pdf ) In 2006, many members of the Church of the Epiphany Episcopal congregation voted to break from the Episcopal Church over above-noted theological and governance issues, and this portion of the congregation stayed at the facilities on Hidden Meadow Drive. In 2007, the remaining members of the Church of the Epiphany Episcopal met with other \\"Continuing Churches,\\" including The Falls Church, St. Margaret's Episcopal Church (Woodbridge, VA), and St. Stephen's Episcopal Church (Heathsville, VA) to plan future actions. On July 8, 2007, the founding members held a meeting of 18 congregationalists and reconstituted the Church of the Epiphany Episcopal. From 2007 to 2012, Epiphany Episcopal Church members first met at congregation member homes and then met in rented space in the nearby Oak Hill Elementary School cafeteria. During this time, legal discussions took place in Virginia's Fairfax Circuit Court regarding disputed Episcopal church facilities in the state, including Epiphany Episcopal Church. * In 2008 the Fairfax Circuit Court initially ruled in favor of the Anglican congregations claiming church property rights. \\"19 Dec 2008--The judge presiding in the church property trial between the Episcopal Church and eleven former congregations, now affiliated with the Anglican District of Virginia (ADV), ruled in the congregations' favor today.\\" https://anglicansablaze.blogspot.com/2008/12/anglican-district-of- virginia-wins.html  Anglican District of Virginia Wins Church Property Case * On June 10, 2010, Justice Lawrence L.

Pat Richards missed the attempted conversion so the score remained 0-4 in favour of the Warriors. Wigan were again attacking from fifteen metres out when their prop Jeff Lima ran onto Paul Prescott's short pass, and into a defensive gap to dive over near the goal posts just before the twenty-four- minute mark. Richards' conversion was successful so Wigan were leading 0-10. In the twenty-eighth minute, Warriors fullback Sam Tomkins was returning the Leeds' kick from within his own ten metres, running across-field before passing the ball out to his brother, right centre Joel Tomkins. Racing down the sideline, he palmed off one defender and had run seventy metres before he stepped back inside and in between the converging Rhinos defenders, continuing on straight to the centre of the goal-line to dive over under the posts for what was described as one of the great Wembley tries. Richards put the kick over so Wigan were in front 0-16. It took until the thirty-fifth minute for Leeds to get on the scoreboard when, having worked the ball up to within the opposition ten-metre line, they kept the ball alive, moving it quickly though the hands out to left winger Ryan Hall who dived over untouched in the corner. Sinfield's difficult conversion attempt rebounded against the goal post back into the field so Wigan's lead remained 4-16. Only two minutes later, Leeds had made their way back into opposition territory, again keeping the ball alive with deft passing, this time getting it out to right winger Ben Jones- Bishop who barged his way over the try-line to score. Sinfield kicked the conversion successfully, bringing the half-time score to 10-16 in the Warriors' favour. Second Half The first eighteen minutes of the second half saw a tight arm-wrestle between the two sides. Then Leeds, having won a scrum from Wigan's error inside their own ten-metre line, moved the ball right to centre Carl Ablett who muscled his way through the defence and onto the try-line. The video referee, Steve Ganson gave the try and Sinfield's goal- kick was wide, leaving the Rhinos trailing the Warriors 14-16. Wigan, having advanced into an attacking position, scored again when Lee Mossop's controversial-looking short pass to Jeff Lima sent the prop forward again crashing over the try line beside the uprights just before the sixty-two- minute mark. Richards converted the try for Wigan to lead 14-22. During the match at Wembley Stadium With nine minutes of the match remaining, Leeds were down at the opposition's end and on the fifth tackle moved the ball through the hands out to their left winger, Ryan Hall to barge through the defence and over the try-line. Sinfield couldn't kick the sideline conversion so Leeds trailed 18-22. After receiving the kick-off, the Rhinos made a good break through right winger Ben Jones-Bishop, who kicked the ball ahead into the in- goal area where neither of the Leeds or Wigan chasers racing though could secure it. With less than two and a half minutes remaining, the Warriors were on Leeds' ten-metre line when dummy-half Tommy Leuluai ran through some tired marker defence to get over the line. The video referee was called upon to rule that the ball was not lost in the attempted grounding and the try was awarded. Richards converted successfully so the match ended in a Wigan 18-28 victory. Post-match The Wigan Warriors had won the Challenge Cup for a record eighteenth time. The Lance Todd Trophy for man-of-the-match was awarded to Wigan prop forward Jeff Lima, who had scored two tries, becoming the fifth New Zealander (and first prop forward since 1980) to win the award. Later, the Rugby Football League found Wigan fullback Sam Tomkins guilty of minor misconduct for an abusive gesture to Leeds fans during the match and fined him ¬£1,000.

At the same time, viruses have co-evolved evasion machinery to address the many ways that host organisms attempt to eradicate them. DNA and RNA viruses use complex methods to evade immune cell detection through disruption of the Interferon Signaling Pathway, remodeling of cellular architecture, targeted gene silencing, and recognition protein cleavage.  Interferon system  The human immune system relies on a plethora of cell-cell signaling pathways to transmit information about a cell's health and microenvironment. Many of these pathways are mediated by soluble ligands, cytokines, that fit like a lock-and-key into adjacent cell surface receptors. This language of cell communication imparts both specificity and spatiotemporal control for the transmission of data. The Interferon System is composed of a family of cytokines. Type-I Interferons, IFN-Œ±/Œ≤, and Type-III Interferons, IFN-Œª play key roles in adaptive immunity, acting as communication highways between cells infected with foreign double stranded DNA or double stranded RNA. Mammalian cells utilize specialized receptors known as Pattern Recognition Receptors(PRRs) to detect viral infection; these receptors are able to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) inscribed in viral DNA and RNA. These pattern recognition receptors, often localized to either the cytosol or the nucleus, are responsible for notifying infected cells and initiating the secretion of interferon cytokines.  Double-stranded RNA mediated immune response  The precise role of double-stranded (ds)RNA is still widely investigated as a central player in the Interferon System. Groups have found that positive- strand RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses produced significant amounts of dsRNA, but the precise methods mammalian cells leverage to distinguish between self vs. non-self dsRNA have yet to be uncovered. Studies suggest that recognition must extend beyond simple identification of dsRNA structure and likely relies on other epigenetic markers.  Double-stranded RNA recognition  Protein kinase activation dsRNA has been implicated in the activation of the interferon system through the activation of Protein Kinase R, PKR. Cytoplasmic PKR is often associated with the ribosome in mammalian cells where it is able to recognize double-stranded and single-stranded RNA and subsequently phosphorylate varies substrates, arresting protein synthesis. The activation of PKR subsequently triggers interferon signaling, initiating cell death in response to viral dsRNA recognition. While the PKR The roles of PKR activation have been deeply studied with groups finding that it is insensitive to the presence of short dsRNA and siRNA but showing significant affinity for dsRNA and ssRNA with secondary structure. 2'-5'- Oligoadenylate synthetase Groups have found that the Interferon Signaling promotes the activation of a 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthestase, sensitive to the presence of dsRNA longer than 15 base pairs. Because this mechanism is not sensitive to self vs. non-self dsRNA binding, results indicate overall reduction in protein synthesis but indicated no specificity for a sole reduction of viral protein synthesis.  Viral evasion strategies  In recent years, studies have focused on how viruses evade Pattern Recognition Receptors, target adaptor proteins and their kinases, inhibit transcription factors for Interferon induction, and evade Interferon Stimulated Genes. Pattern recognition receptor evasion Viruses of the flaviviridae Family, such as hepatitis C virus, have developed complex viral mechanisms to rearrange the cell membrane, creating a membranaceous web designed to house viral replication machinery. These viruses utilize endogenous host cell nuclear pore complex proteins to shield viral RNA from Pattern Recognition Receptors by excluding PRRs from the interior of the viral membrane compartment. By utilizing architectural rearrangement of the membrane, viruses have developed a method to evade cytoplasm localized pattern recognition proteins such as RIG-I. In order to evade pattern recognition, other viruses such as Enterovirus have evolved multi-functional proteins that not only help in viral protein processing but also cleave cytoplasmic recognition proteins MDA5 and RIG-I, further demonstrating the extent to which viruses can reduce Interferon Signaling through various pathways. Other viruses have been reported to target upstream activators of pattern recognition proteins, antagonizing upstream proteins that removed inhibitory post-translational modifications. Nucleic acid shielding Other viruses utilize host cell proteins to shield viral DNA until it has reached the nucleus. Upon entry into the host cell cytoplasm, the HIV-1 capsid is recognized and bound by cyclophilin A (CypA); this affinity interaction stabilizes the capsid and prevents exposure of the HIV-1 cDNA to pattern recognition receptors in the cytoplasm. This shielding allows the HIV-1 cDNA to translocate to the nucleus where it may begin replication.

It extends from the lower slopes of the Alborz and Kopet Dag mountain ranges to the steppes of Turkmenistan. The River Gorgan flows through the plain from east to west, emptying into the Caspian Sea. The provincial capital Gorgan lies to the south of the plain, which covers an area of about and is situated between 37¬∞00' and 37¬∞30' north latitude, and between 54¬∞00' and 54¬∞30' east longitude. The annual precipitation in the south of the plain is about which is much higher than the just to the north. The southern part is very fertile, being watered by the many streams that flow from the Alborz Mountains. History More than fifty Neolithic sites have been identified on the Gorgan Plain. Most are raised on mounds and many have seen more than one period of occupation. The sites are thought to relate to the Jeitun culture of southern Turkmenistan and may date to the sixth millennium BC, judging by the age of the artefacts found at Sang-i Chakmak. Other nearby sites include Yarim Tepe, and Tureng Tepe. The Great Wall of Gorgan was built between about 420 AD and 530s AD by the Sasanian Empire on the northern edge of the plain between the Caspian Sea and the mountains. It stretched for nearly and protected the fertile plain from encroachment by White Huns from the north. The wall and forts along it were built of red mudbrick and fired brick, and to provide the water necessary for the manufacture of the bricks, a system of canals was dug across the plain; one canal paralleled the wall, which had to follow the natural gradient, while others were fed from supplier canals, which bridged the Gorgan River with the help of qanats. A mile to the south of the wall lies Qaleh Kharabeh, a fort that may have housed a garrison serving on the wall. It contains the remains of roadways and rows of mud-brick huts.

Anderson often makes films about musicians he admires, such as Brian Wilson, the American singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded The Beach Boys. His interest in film-making began when he saw Richard Lester‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Hard Day's Night‚Äù at the age of 10. Some of Anderson's inspirations are the works of many filmmakers, including Michelangelo Antonioni (Blowup, 1966), Murray Lerner (Festival, 1967) and Jerry Lewis (The Disorderly Orderly, 1964). He is an alumnus of Northwestern University School of Communication, where he studied Radio/TV/Film and Music Theory & Composition. Early Life and Education Anderson was born in Columbus, Ohio in 1954. He spent his childhood in Rochester, New York, and San Rafael, California before moving as a teenager to Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia. He started making films at that time, shooting on 8mm stock and composing and recording musical accompaniment. After graduation from Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School in Pennsylvania, he moved to Illinois where he attended Northwestern University in Evanston, studying Radio/TV/Film and Music Theory & Composition. While at Northwestern, he made a series of works using film and reel-to-reel videotape as a student of Dana Hodgdon and James Benning. Anderson also edited Northwestern's humor magazine The Purple Parrot and produced a weekly radio show on WNUR called Rough Cut, which included live recordings he made in Chicago-area folk, blues, and rock clubs. Don‚Äôt Blame Me, Anderson's 1973 live recording of Chicago singer-songwriter Steve Goodman, was released commercially by Red Pajamas Records in 2013. Goodman's body of work includes the well-known song City of New Orleans. In 1997, he directed and edited Larger Than Life: A Celebration of Steve Goodman and His Music, a live concert held at Chicago's Medinah Temple, which was released on DVD by Red Pajamas Records in 2007, and features John Prine, Arlo Guthrie, Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett and Jackson Browne. Career Anderson began his career as an editor at Chicago film production/post-production facilities including Advanced Systems; Telemation; Post Effects; and IPA The Editing House. While at Post Effect, he edited The Super Bowl Shuffle (1985), featuring the championship Chicago Bears. At the time, The Super Bowl Shuffle was the second-highest selling music video. Shortly after the release of The Super Bowl Shuffle, the Chicago Bears defeated the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XX winning the NFL Championship on January 26, 1986. Anderson was also named Screen Magazine's Editor of the Year and won a Best Editor of a Music Video International Monitor Award for the music video She Won‚Äôt French Kiss by his own band, The Cleaning Ladys. He subsequently worked as a documentary editor for Bill Kurtis at Kurtis Productions on several series, including The New Explorers (PBS), NOVŒõ and A&E;'s Investigative Reports. In 1995, Anderson was one of the founding partners of Superior Street, a Chicago video and film production studio. While there, he began his professional relationship with Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson, leading to a series of four DVD collaborations with Wilson, beginning with Imagination (1999); Brian Wilson On Tour (2002); ‚ÄúPet Sounds Live In London‚Äù (2003), and finally, ‚ÄúBrian Wilson Presents SMiLE‚Äù (2005), the live performance platinum-selling DVD release from Warner Brothers/Rhino Home Video for which he was nominated in 2006 for a Grammy Award as director. In 2012, Anderson co-directed, co-edited and co-wrote the PBS documentary The Beach Boys: Doin‚Äô It Again He also directed and filmed Brian Wilson's performance of the title song in the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy, starring John Cusack, Paul Dano and Elizabeth Banks. In 2007, he founded Anderson Productions, where he continues making films such as the Chicago blues documentary Born In Chicago, featuring Nick Gravenites, Corky Siegel, Sam Lay, and Barry Goldberg and also starring Keith Richards, Charlie Musselwhite, Hubert Sumlin and Jack White. Born In Chicago premiered at the 2013 South By Southwest Film Festival and screened at New York City's Lincoln Center, Chicago's Gene Siskel Film Center, The Grammy Museum in Los Angeles and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It has been the subject of feature articles in Rolling Stone and The New York Times. The film is produced by Out The Box Records. In 2008 and Anderson received an Emmy as the Executive Producer of CPS Right Now!, a biweekly television news-magazine he created for the Chicago Public Schools, for which he also received 9 Emmy nominations. In 2015, Anderson directed and edited Sam Lay In Bluesland, a documentary about legendary Chicago blues drummer Sam Lay, featuring James Cotton and Iggy Pop. It aired on PBS in 2017 and kicked off the 2017 Chicago Blues Festival with a screening at the Chicago Cultural Center. The film is produced by Starr Sutherland and executive produced by Michael Prussian. Anderson's latest film, Horn From The Heart: The Paul Butterfield Story, co-written by him and executive producer Sandra Warren, is a documentary about the life and career of blues harmonica great Paul Butterfield.

He came to New Zealand with his family as a boy and took over his father's fruiterer and fruit grower business as a young man. Politically ambitious, he was mayor of Lyttelton for eight years spanning three periods. He stood for parliament on four occasions between 1881 and 1905 but was unsuccessful. Early life Webb was born in Canterbury, Kent, England in 1848 but grew up at the seaside port of Ramsgate. His father was Samuel Webb, a shoemaker. His mother was Ann Webb. The Webbs, with their seven children, came to Lyttelton on the Regina in December 1859. His father initially worked in his learned trade in Lyttelton's main street but soon became a fruiterer and fruit grower. The company operated from Brenchley Farm of the Alport family. Webb junior helped his father and also worked as a baker. When his father died in January 1875, Webb took over the fruiterer and concentrated more on trade by shipping. Political career Webb first stood for the Lyttelton Borough Council in the September 1879 elections. He was one of six candidates for three available positions and coming fourth, he missed out. A year later, he topped the local poll and was elected as one of three new councillors. At the 24 November 1880 mayoral election, Webb challenged the incumbent, Harry Allwright, for the Lyttelton mayoralty, but Allwright beat off his challenger by 197 to 108 votes. At the 30 November 1881 mayoral election, the result between Allwright and Webb was much closer, with just nine votes between them. Just over a week later, Webb, Allwright, and Edward Richardson contested the Lyttelton electorate in the 1881 general election and the outcome was equally close. Web came last, just 13 votes behind Allwright and 2 votes behind Richardson. Allwright retired from the mayoralty at the end of his 1882 term and the 29 November 1882 election was won by Webb, who beat Bryan Weyburne by 195 votes to 131. At the 28 November 1883, Webb was challenged by Hugh Macdonald and was reconfirmed by a one-vote-margin: 158 votes to 157. At the 22 July 1884 general election, Webb once again contested the Lyttelton electorate but was beaten by Allwright, the incumbent. Webb retired from the mayoralty at the end of 1884. Webb stood for the Lyttelton Borough Council in September 1886 and was successful. Four candidates were nominated for the November 1886 mayoral election but one of them pulled out before election day. Former mayor Allwright was successful with 156 votes, with Hugh McLellan and Webb getting 94 and 72 votes, respectively. The 30 November 1887 mayoral election was contested by Webb and James Boyton Milsom, won by Webb with 181 votes to 130. The same candidates contested the 28 November 1888 mayoral election, with Webb again successful, having received 194 votes to Milsom's 136. Webb retired from the mayoralty in 1889. Webb contested the 1896 general election and of the three candidates, he came a distant last with 13% of the vote. In April 1902, the mayoralty was contested by James Grubb and Webb, with a decisive win for Grubb with 464 votes to 184. Webb and Charles Kay contested the 27 April 1904 mayoral election, with Webb successful at 387 votes to 106. Webb as incumbent was the sole candidate in April 1905 and was declared elected unopposed. At the December 1905 general election, Webb was one of four candidates in the Lyttelton electorate and he came last with 7.6% of the vote. At the 25 April 1906 mayoral election, Webb was challenged by former mayor William Radcliffe but retained his position, with 354 votes to 236. Former mayor Joseph Thomas Brice and councillor Colin Kay challenged Webb for the mayoralty at the 24 April 1907 election, but Webb had a comfortable win. At the 29 April 1908 mayoral election, Colin Cook beat Webb with 427 votes to 373. Webb then joined the borough council as a councillor. He attended his last borough council on 26 April 1913; he had thus been almost continuously on the council as either a councillor or mayor for more than three decades. Important decisions made during Webb's term as mayor included a better drinking water supply (with wells sunk in Heathcote Valley) and an improved sewage system. Private life On 8 March 1887, Webb married Sophie Dohrman, the daughter of a farmer from Carleton. As an infant, she had also come out on the Regina. Webb retired during the 1910s and moved to Christchurch. He died on 17 January 1933 at his residence in Normans Road, Strowan, Christchurch. He was survived by his wife, four sons, and two daughters. He was buried at Waimairi Cemetery.

Origins  The amaQwabe are the senior and larger clan of the Makhanya and the Zulu clans all descending from one common ancestor, Malandela. They are descendant from Qwabe (whose name means a Large 'musical bow'/single-stringed harp) the eldest son of Malandela and his wife Nozidiya/Nozinja of the Zungu clan. Following the death of Malandela, Qwabe became the king. In accordance with Embo-Nguni customary practices when Qwabe inherited the kingship, he went and built a new homestead to serve as the center of the kingdom. leaving his younger brother Zulu to rule over a few people who remained at their father Malandela's estate. The kingdom thrived sometime in the 18th century as \\"one of the most ancient and famous tribes in Natal and Zululand\\". At its peak the amaQwabe occupied central KwaZulu-Natal, they were found beneath the Amandawe and Ngoye Hills, south of the Mhlathuze River until it reached the Mthethwa and Dube areas, up the Mhlathuze River almost as far as Nkandla forest, winding up between the Mhlathuze and Tugela Rivers and finally overflowing into Natal.  Expansion and political structure  After separating from his brethren with the majority of Malandela's people, Qwabe and his followers settled beneath the Ngoye hills. This is where Qwabe built the kingdoms new center, eMthandeni. Before amaQwabe occupation the area between the Mhlathuze and Tugela rivers was occupied by the Cele clan a sub-branch of the Mthethwa kingdom. The Qwabe drove out the Thuli and Cele clans as well as the amaMbili, amaKwela and amaKomo tribes, from between the Mhlathuze and the Tugela rivers into the coast district of Natal. Before the Shaka era the amaQwabe kingdom had already expanded control over parts of Natal south of the Thukela River. The expansion of this kingdom over territory and smaller chiefdom's was enough to regard it as one of the few larger kingdoms of the region. The kingdom under Phakawayo kaKhondlo and generally was characterized by seven large villages, each headed by an important member from the ruling lineage. Regiments were round up by village rather than age, this included women regiments also. Evidence suggest that the authority to form women regiments (isigodlo) was only given to senior powerful kings such as Phakatwayo of The Qwabe, Dingiswayo of the Mthetwa and Zwide of the Ndwandwe for instance.

History Shoaf was born in Panama City, and attended Tallahassee Community College and Florida State University. He is the nephew of former Governor Wayne Mixson and the grandson of former State Representative Cecil G. Costin. Shoaf worked as a businessman prior to entering politics, serving as the vice-president of St. Joe Natural Gas Company and Gulf South Self Storage and Alliance Property Management. He was appointed to the board of the Port St. Joe Port Authority Board and to the board of Triumph Gulf Coast, a state-run non-profit tasked with disbursing funds recovered from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Florida House of Representatives Following Halsey Beshear's resignation from the House to serve as Secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, a special election was held to replace Beshears in the House. Shoaf announced that he would run in the special election, and faced Mike Watkins, Lynda Bell, the Sneads City Manager and a former Miami-Dade County Commissioner; and 2018 congressional candidate Virginia Fuller in the primary election. He campaigned on \\"bringing high-paying jobs to the district\\" and on \\"expand[ing] vocational opportunities\\" in public schools and emphasized his outsider credentials. He was endorsed by several prominent North Florida Republican politicians‚Äîformer State House Speaker Allan Bense, former State Senate President Don Gaetz, and Congressman Matt Gaetz‚Äîwhile Watkins was endorsed by local sheriffs and the state's police and firefighter unions and Bell was endorsed by a right-to-life group. The campaign grew heated and personal, with Watkins nearly starting a fight with Shoaf after Watkins alleged that Shoaf touched his fianc√©e‚Äôs arm, an allegation Shoaf & witnesses denied. Ultimately, despite the perceived closeness of the race, Shoaf ended up winning by a wide margin, receiving 49% of the vote to Watkins's 27%, Bell's 20%, and Fuller's 4%. Shoaf advanced to the general election, where he faced Ryan Terrell, a Tallahassee communications consultant and the Democratic nominee. Against Terrell, Shoaf focused on his conservative positions, like his support for Donald Trump, gun rights, and anti-abortion legislation, but also campaigned on nonpartisan issues, like helping the district recover from Hurricane Michael. Ultimately, despite the district's Democratic voter registration and history of supporting downballot Democratic candidates, Shoaf prevailed over Terrell in a landslide, winning 71% of the vote to Terrell's 29%.

The line mostly provided service between both Prince George's County & Montgomery County before being discontinued in 2009 due to low ridership. History Initial background C7 originally operated by itself as part of WMATA's former \\"Twinbrook-Silver Spring\\" Line from February 19, 1978 & September, 2000. From February 1978 until January 1985, route C7 operated between Silver Spring station & the former E.J. Korvette's Department Store in Rockville, via the Parklawn Building. In January, 1985, route C7 was truncated to only operate between Silver Spring & Twinbrook station, via the Parklawn Building & Grosvenor‚ÄìStrathmore station. 2000 service changes In September, 2000, the Twinbrook-Silver Spring Line was discontinued as it overlaps Metrobus routes Q2, Y5, Y7, Y8, and Y9 along Georgia Avenue between Silver Spring & Wheaton stations, as well as the segment of route C4 routing between Wheaton & Twinbrook stations. Route C7 was rerouted to operate alongside a brand new Route C9 as part of the brand new \\"Greenbelt-Glenmont Line\\".Both routes would operate between Greenbelt & Glenmont stations during rush hours only. The line was created as an experiment by WMATA in order to improve the cross-county Metrobus connections between both Prince George's County & Montgomery County. Both C7 & C9 would operate on different routing between Greenbelt station and the intersection of Randolph Road & Old Columbia Pike in Fairland. Route C7 would operate along, Edmonston Road, Sunnyside Avenue, Tucker Street, Ewing Road, Rhode Island Avenue, Powder Mill Road, Beltsville Drive, Calverton Boulevard, Broadbirch Drive, Old Columbia Pike, and Randolph Road via Centerpark Office Park in Beltsville, MD and Verizon Chesapeake Complex. Route C9 would operate along Cherrywood Lane, Greenbelt Road, Baltimore Avenue, Cherry Hill Road, & Randolph Road via the Seven Springs Village Apartment Complex and Cherry Hill Park Campground. Both C7 & C9 would then rejoin each other and operate on the exact same routing between the intersection of Randolph Road & Old Columbia Pike in Fairland, MD and Glenmont station, via Randolph Road & Georgia Avenue. 2004 service changes On September 26, 2004, route C7 went through major route changes. While it remain operating on the same route it was on between Greenbelt station & Verizon Chesapeake Complex, it was rerouted to no longer return from the Verizon Chesapeake Complex, onto the intersection of Old Columbia Pike when operating towards Glenmont station but instead operate via Muskgrove Road, Fairland Road, & Tamarack Road, to rejoin route C9 at the intersection of Randolph Road & Tamarack Road. The changes were made was so that the same level of Metrobus service could be provided on the segment of route Z1 and Z4 routing between the Verizon Chesapeake Complex & Glenmont Metro Station, via Muskgrove Road, Fairland Road, Tamarack Road, Randolph Road, & Georgia Avenue and routes Z7 and Z17 between Centerpark Office Park in Beltsville & the intersection of Tech Road & Industrial Parkway in Fairland, via Beltsville Drive, Calverton Boulevard, & Tech Road, which were all discontinued on September 26, 2004. Route C9 replaced the segment of route C7's routing on Randolph Road between the intersections of Old Columbia Pike & Tamarack Road in Fairland, MD, and route Z4 routing between the intersection of Randolph Road & Old Columbia Pike and Glenmont station. Discontinuation of service During WMATA's Fiscal Year of 2008, it was proposed to eliminate the Greenbelt‚ÄìGlenmont Line. Montgomery County expressed interest in discontinuing the line and reinvesting resources to improve overcrowding, service reliability and provide additional service on the Z line routes that serves the Route 29 corridor. At the time of the proposals, route C7 and C9 have been an underperformer in Maryland since September 2000. Service only ran during Weekday Peak Hour periods every 27‚Äì37 minutes averaging 330 per day on 24 trips, or an average of 14 passengers per revenue trip with the system average is 32 passengers per revenue trip. The line also runs on 96% of already existing routes. On June 28, 2009, the Greenbelt‚ÄìGlenmont Line was eliminated due to low productivity and replaced by various routes. Route C7's routing between the Greenbelt station and intersection of Sunnyside Avenue & Tucker Road in Beltsville, was taken over by routes 87, 89 & 89M. Service between the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue & Baltimore Avenue & the Centerpark Office Park in Beltsville, was fully taken over by route 86. Service along the intersection of Beltsville Drive & Powder Mill Road in Calverton & intersection of Broadbirch Drive & Plum Orchard Drive in Westfarm, were fully taken over by both routes R2 & R5. Service between the intersection of Calverton Boulevard & Galway Drive in Calverton, MD & the intersection of Tech Road & Columbia Pike in Fairland, was replaced by route Z6. There was no replacement Metrobus service provided along Tucker Road & Ewing Road, or between Calverton Boulevard & Beltsville Drive which C7 operated on. Route C9's routing between the Greenbelt station and intersection of Baltimore Avenue & Greenbelt Road, were taken over by routes 81 & C2. Service between Baltimore Avenue and the Cherry Hill Park Campground, via the Seven Springs Village Apartment Complex, were replaced by routes 81, 83, and 86. Routes R2 & R5 replaced route C9 service between the intersections of Powder Mill Road & Broadbirch Drive eastbound only. No replacement Metrobus service was provided on Cherry Hill Road between the Cherry Hill Park Campground and intersection of Powder Mill Road, between Cherry Hill Road between the intersections of Broadbirch Drive & Old Columbia Pike, or between the intersections of Powder Mill Road & Broadbirch Drive Westbound. Service between the intersection of Randolph Road & Old Columbia Pike and intersection of Randolph Road & New Hampshire Avenue in Colesville, was replaced by Montgomery County Ride On Route 10. The remaining segment of route C7 & C9 routing between the intersection of Randolph Road & New Hampshire Avenue & and Glenmont station, was taken over by route C8.

He was a grandfather of Anna Hall Roosevelt, the wife of Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt (brother of President Theodore Roosevelt) and mother of First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt. Early life A scion of a prominent Hudson River family, Ludlow was born in 1810 on Greenwich Street in New York City, which was a fashionable residential area at the time. He was a son of Gabriel Verplanck Ludlow, a lawyer who was at one time a Master-in-Chancery, and Elizabeth A. (n√©e Hunter) Ludlow. Among his siblings was older brother Robert Henry Ludlow (who married Cornelia Le Roy) and Ann Eliza Gabriella Ludlow (wife of Horatio Gates Lewis). His paternal grandparents were Gabriel George Ludlow and Anne (n√©e Verplanck) Ludlow (sister of Gulian Verplanck, the Federalist Speaker of the New York State Assembly). His maternal grandparents were Robert Hunter and Ruth (n√©e Brick) Hunter. His paternal grandfather was \\"one of the three Ludlows who were members of the Committee of One Hundred which was organized in 1775 to support the cause of the American patriots.\\" The first Ludlow in America was Gabriel Ludlow, who settled in New Amsterdam in 1694 and became a prominent and influential merchant and a clerk of the New York General Assembly. Career Ludlow studied medicine and duly received his degrees and diploma from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1831 before becoming a medical doctor. He later served as trustee of the Medical Department of Columbia College in 1872. After practicing medicine for a few years, he turned to business, relinquishing his practice and in 1836 opening a real estate office at 11 Broad Street. In 1845, after accumulating significant wealth, he retired to his country estate near Tivoli-on-the-Hudson. In 1850, however, he returned to New York and went into partnership with General Edward Jones Mallett (former Consul-General to Italy during the U.S. Civil War) until Mattlett's retirement in 1856. In 1856, Ludlow entered into a partnership with Morris Wilkins under the same name as the predecessor firm, E. H. Ludlow & Co., with principal offices located on Pine Street in lower Manhattan. The firm of auctioneers, real estate agents and brokers, which was the most prominent in New York City, offered to lease Edgewood, the former estate of Frederick Prime (youngest son of banker Nathaniel Prime) on the Long Island Sound. Around early 1884, he took an active interest in forming the New York Real Estate Exchange and Auction Room, becoming its president and continuing as one of the \\"controlling spirits in that organization up to the time of his death.\\" Personal life In 1833, Ludlow was married to Elizabeth Livingston (1813‚Äì1896) in New York City. Elizabeth was the second daughter of Lt. Gov. of New York Edward Philip Livingston and his wife, Elizabeth Stevens Livingston (eldest daughter of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston and granddaughter of Continental Congressman John Stevens). The Ludlow country estate called \\"Pine Lawn\\" had a quarter mile front on the Hudson River. Situated next to Northwood (her brother Robert Edward Livingston's estate), Pine Lawn was the furthest north of the five subdivisions his father-in-law made to his children. Together, they were the parents of: * Elizabeth Livingston Ludlow, who died young. * Edward Philip Livingston Ludlow (1835‚Äì1915), who married Margaret Tonnel√© Hall, daughter of Valentine Gill Hall and Susan (n√©e Tonnel√©) Hall, in 1863. * Gabriel Augustus Ludlow (1838‚Äì1844), who died young. * Mary \\"Molly\\" Livingston Ludlow (1843‚Äì1919), who married Margaret's brother Valentine Gill Hall Jr., a nephew of John Tonnel√© Jr., the farmer and politician who was a member of the New Jersey State Legislature. Their country estate, a Second Empire-style mansion known as \\"The Oaks\\", was part of and just south of Ludlow's Pine Lawn estate. After a period of feeble health, Ludlow died on November 27, 1884 at 21 East 24th Street, his residence in New York City. After a funeral conducted by the Rev. Dr. Charles Comfort Tiffany was held at the Zion Church at Madison Avenue and 38th Street, his remains were interred in the family vault at Tivoli. Descendants Through his son Edward, he was a grandfather of two: Susan Livingston Ludlow, who married Henry Parrish Jr. in 1884, and Edward Hunter Ludlow II, named after him. Through his daughter Mary, he was a grandfather of seven, including: Anna Rebecca Hall (1863‚Äì1892), who married Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt (brother of President Theodore Roosevelt); Valentine Hall III (1867‚Äì1934); and Edward Ludlow Hall (1872‚Äì1932). Through his granddaughter Anna, he was the great-grandfather of Gracie Hall Roosevelt and First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of her fifth cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

From 1959 until his death he held the senior position as apostolic delegate or apostolic nuncio in several countries in Latin America and Africa, ending his career as Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal. Biography Sante Portalupi was born in Mortara, Italy, on 1 November 1909. He was ordained a priest on 15 April 15 1933. That same year he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy to prepare for a career in the diplomatic service. On 29 January 1959, Pope John XXIII appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Honduras and to Nicaragua. On 14 October 1961, Pope John named him Titular Archbishop of Christopolis. He received his episcopal consecration on 3 December from Cardinal Benedetto Aloisi Masella. On 27 September 1967, Pope Paul VI appointed Portalupi Apostolic Delegate to Northern Africa. In the years that followed, the Holy See established relationships with countries within Portalupi's mandate as delegate, and he took on the additional titles of Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Algeria on 6 March 1972, Pro-Nuncio to Tunisia on 22 March 1972, and Pro-Nuncio to Morocco on 5 March 1976. These modifications left his role as Delegate to Northern Africa with responsibility for a single country, and his delegate's title changed to Apostolic Delegate to Libya. Pope John Paul II appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal on 15 December 1979. When Pope John Paul sought to fulfill the instructions relayed by Sister L√∫cia of Fatima calling for the consecration of Russia to the Virgin Mary, Portalupi interviewed her in 1982 and again in 1983 to ascertain whether the instructions had been carried out properly. He died while still in that post on 31 March 1984.

Early life Clarkson was born on September 6, 1793 in New York City. He was a son of Thomas Streatfeild Clarkson Sr. (1763‚Äì1844) and Elizabeth (n√©e Van Horne) Clarkson (1771‚Äì1852). His paternal grandparents were David Clarkson Jr. and Elizabeth (n√©e French) Clarkson. Through his younger brother Thomas Jr., he was an uncle to Thomas S. Clarkson, the namesake of Clarkson University. His maternal grandparents were Thomas Van Horne and Anna Maria (n√©e Van Cortlandt) Van Horne. Career and personal life Front of Chiddingstone (facing the Hudson River), 2018.Rear view of Chiddingstone, 2018. Clarkson was an 1810 graduate in arts of Columbia College. On October 4, 1827, Clarkson was married to Margaret Livingston (1808‚Äì1874) at Clermont, the Livingston family estate on the Hudson River. Margaret was the daughter of Lt. Gov. of New York Edward Philip Livingston and his wife, Elizabeth Stevens Livingston (eldest daughter of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston and granddaughter of Continental Congressman John Stevens). The Clarkson country estate, a wooden frame home called \\"Chiddingstone,\\" had a quarter mile front on the Hudson River and was one of the five subdivisions his father-in-law made to his children. Together, they were the parents of: * Edward Livingston Clarkson (1828‚Äì1829), who died in infancy. * Elizabeth Clarkson (1830‚Äì1860), who married George Gibbes Barnwell (1826‚Äì1902), grand-nephew of Robert Barnwell, in 1854. * Thomas Streatfield Clarkson (1834‚Äì1898), who was involved in real estate and who married Mary Whitmarsh, daughter of Richmond Whitmarsh and Cornelia (n√©e de Peyster) Whitmarsh. Clarkson died on November 24, 1850. His wife died in New York City on April 28, 1874. After this death in 1850, his wife divided their Hudson River estate into two, with the north lot (containing Chiddingstone) going to son Thomas, who razed the elder Clarkson's home and, around 1860, constructed a new Italianate and classical brick home in its place, also called Chiddingstone. Their daughter Elizabeth received the southern half. After her death in 1860, the property was sold to William H. Hunt of New Orleans for his wife Elizabeth Ridgely (a great-granddaughter of Chancellor Livingston through his daughter Margaret). Descendants Through his daughter Elizabeth, he was a grandfather of Robert Morgan Gibbes Barnwell (1858‚Äì1930), who married Elizabeth Marie (daughter of Albin Marie) in 1883. Through his son Thomas, he was a grandfather of David Augustus Clarkson (1858‚Äì1952), an 1881 Columbia graduate who served as president of the Real Estate Board of Brokers. Clarkson served as a trustee of the New York Dispensary for many years and \\"once conducted, by order of Gov.

She was born in Paris to Suzanne Lang and Dr. L√©on Zadoc-Kahn, former Chief Medical Officer of the Rothschild Hospital in Paris and president of the central committee of Keren haYesod France. Her grandfather was Zadoc Kahn, the chief rabbi of France. Life and career During her studies, she was a student of the Russian-born astronomer Benjamin Jekhowsky, of the Paris Observatory and then at the Algiers Observatory. In 1924, after she had completed her license de sciences physiques, she worked in the laboratories of the physicist Aim√© Cotton at the science faculty of the University of Paris (now University of Paris-Saclay). In the 1920s and 1930s, she presented research papers on liquid crystals (using the term \\"mesomorphic substances\\"), particularly para-Azoxyanisole, variations in its anisotropy due to thermal effects and her PhD thesis (1936) covered its electro- and magneto-optical properties; in doing this she was one of the very few scientists developing a field which was little more than a point of interest for three more decades until the first demonstration of liquid crystal display technology in the late 1960s. She had regular contact with leading contemporary scientists of the day, including theoretical physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, to whom she was introduced by her father's friend, Sylvain L√©vi, an expert in Sanskrit and oriental studies. They first met in 1924 at lectures of Paul Langevin at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris and then at those of Louis de Broglie; Bose stayed in Paris with her during his year-long sojourn in Europe in the 1920s. She was very impressed with his knowledge of Hebrew literature and religion and noted his lack of personal ambition. He retained a deep personal affection for her, later relating to her the conversations and lectures of Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr√∂dinger. She married Jacques Charles Eisenmann, an engineer from Dijon two years her elder, on 22 December 1930 in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. In 1932, her daughter Ir√®ne was born and, in 1936, her son Daniel. When World War II began, she volunteered to work in a laboratory of the air ministry. When the French forces were defeated by Nazi Germany in 1940, her brother, Bertrand Zadoc-Kahn (20 November 1901 - 17 June 1940), a cardiologist at the American Hospital of Paris, committed suicide by shooting himself. The American financier, Eugene Meyer, had offered sanctuary to her father - Meyer's cousin - in the U.S.A., as he had already resettled two other families of his European relatives; the Zadoc-Kahns declined, however, so deeply affected were they by their son's death. During the Vichy government era of World War II that followed, her parents were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, amongst 76,000 Jews who were rounded up and deported from France; they were killed in the camp in 1943.; She herself was hidden by a Roman Catholic family for the duration of the war. After World War II, she worked at :fr:L'Institut fran√ßais du caoutchouc (IFC) (French Rubber Institute), in their documentation service. She met Bose again upon his return to Europe in 1951, an event which she described as her first happiness after the death of her parents. She died on 15 May 1998, aged 94, survived by Jacques Eisenmann for eight years, until his death at 103. Legacy 1017 Jacqueline, a carbonaceous asteroid, discovered in 1924 by her former teacher Benjamin Jekhowsky at the Algiers Observatory, was named in her honour.

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the regiment is assigned to the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\".  History   Formation  The regiment was formed on 15 September 1936 in Rome as 4th Tank Infantry Regiment with six battalions: VIII, IX, X, and XII assault tanks battalions and the II and V breach tanks battalion. The assault tanks battalions fielded L3/35 tankettes, while the breach tanks battalion fielded Fiat 3000 light tanks. The regiment also had oversight over a L3/35 equipped tank company in Sardinia. The regiment's initial structure was: * 4th Tank Infantry Regiment, in Rome ** VIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Bettoia\\", in Rome (L3/35 tankettes) ** IX Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Guadagni\\", in Bari (L3/35 tankettes) ** X Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Menzinger\\", in Caserta (L3/35 tankettes) ** XII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Cangialosi\\", in Palermo (L3/35 tankettes) ** II Breach Tanks Battalion, in Rome (Fiat 3000 light tanks) ** V Breach Tanks Battalion, in Rome (Fiat 3000 light tanks) ** Assault Tanks Company \\"Sardegna\\", in Cagliari (L3/35 tankettes) ** 4th Tank Training Center, in Rome ** 4th Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Rome On 15 July 1937 the regiment ceded the II Breach Tanks Battalion to the forming 31st Tank Infantry Regiment. During the same year the regiment raised two battalions for service in Libya: the XX Assault Tanks Battalion on 5 June and XXI Assault Tanks Battalion on 1 October. For their service during the Western Desert Campaign the XX and XXI assault tanks battalions were each awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valour, which are nowadays displayed on the war flag of the 4th Tank Regiment. On 30 November the V Breach Tanks Battalion moved from Rome to Riva del Garda and joined the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment. On 30 May 1939 the VIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Bettoia\\" and the X Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Menzinger\\" were transferred to Albania, where they joined the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, which in turn ceded one of its two breach tanks battalions, namely the CCCXII (former II Breach Tank Battalion) to the 4th Regiment. In fall 1939 the IX Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Guadagni\\" was transferred to Libya, where it joined the XXII Army Corps. In 1940 the tank company in Sardinia was expanded to battalion and renamed XIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Sardegna\\". As the Fiat 3000 light tanks were obsolete the CCCXII battalion was transferred as garrison unit to Rhodes in the Italian Islands of the Aegean on 30 March 1940. After having ceded the VIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Bettoia\\" the 4th regiment raised a new battalion named VIII Assault Tanks Battalion bis. In April 1940 tank battalions were renamed and so the regiment entered World War II with the following structure: * 4th Tank Infantry Regiment, in Rome ** VIII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" bis (L3/35 tankettes) ** XII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) ** XIII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) ** 4th Tank Training Center, in Rome ** 4th Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Rome  World War II  On 11 June 1940, the day after Italy's entry into World War II, the regiment was sent to Libya. It arrived on 8 July 1940 in Benghazi with the I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" and II Tank Battalion \\"M\\", both equipped with M11/39 tanks. The I and II tank battalions \\"M\\" had been formed by the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment with personnel from the disbanded III and IV breach tanks battalions. The regiment also received the LXIII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" after arriving in the colony. The regiment's tanks clashed with British units for the first time on 5 August 1940 near Sidi Azeiz. On 29 August 1940 all tank battalions in Libya were combined in three formations of the Babini Group. The four battalions of the \\"LX\\"-series had been formed in Libya after the war's outbreak by the XX Tank Battalion \\"L\\" in Tripolitania respectively the XXI Tank Battalion \\"L\\" in Cyrenaica: * Libyan Tank Command, General Valentino Babini ** I Tankers Grouping (Aresca Group), Colonel Pietro Aresca, commander of the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment *** I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M11/39 tanks) *** XXI Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) *** LXII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) *** LXIII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) ** II Tankers Grouping (Trivioli Group), Colonel Antonio Trivioli *** II Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (minus one company; M11/39 tanks) *** IX Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) *** XX Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) *** LXI Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) ** Mixed Tank Battalion *** 1x \\"M\\" company (from the II Tank Battalion \\"M\\") *** 1x \\"L\\" company (from the LX Tank Battalion \\"L\\") ** LX Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (minus one company; L3/35 tankettes; for the XXI Army Corps) The I Tankers Grouping participated in the Italian invasion of Egypt in September, but stopped in Sidi Barrani, where the Italian units dug in. When the British counterattack began on 9 December 1940 the Italian tank units were deployed piecemeal and easily defeated by the more numerous and better British tanks. The first two battalions to be annihilated were the II Tank Battalion \\"M\\" during the early morning surprise Attack on Nibeiwa and the IX Tank Battalion \\"L\\" in the early afternoon of the same day as prelude to the Battle of Sidi Barrani. With the Italian forces retreating from Sidi Barrani to Bardia tanks of the I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" were sent forward to Sollum and the Halfaya Pass to delay the British advance. By 15 December both locations were in British hands and the remnants I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" retreated to Tobruk, while the LX Tank Battalion \\"L\\" was destroyed at Buq Buq. The III Tank Battalion \\"M\\", with the army's most modern tanks withdrew to Mechili, while the XXI Tank Battalion \\"L\\" left its tankettes at Tobruk and moved to Benghazi to mount on M13/40 tanks that had arrived along with the V Tank Battalion \\"M\\" with M13/40 tanks and the V Tank Battalion \\"L\\" with L3/35 tankettes from Italy. During the Battle of Bardia the V, XX, LXI, and LXII tank battalions \\"L\\" were destroyed. On 7 January 1941 the headquarter of the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment with the remnants of the I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" and the LXIII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" were surrounded with other Italian forces at Tobruk. On 20 January during the British capture of Tobruk the position of the 4th regiment was overrun by the 19th Australian Brigade with such ferocity that 70% of the officers, including both battalion commanders, and 50% of the troops of the regiment were killed in action. On 13 January the VI Tank Battalion \\"M\\" with M13/40 tanks had arrived from Italy and joined the Babini Group with its V and XXI tank battalions \\"M\\". On 24 January the Babini Group clashed inconclusively with the 7th British Armoured Division at Mechili. After Mechili the Italian army retreated further East to Beda Fomm, where the British successfully cut off the line of retreat and destroyed the Italian 10th Army with its III, V, VI, and XXI tank battalions \\"M\\" on 6-7 February during the Battle of Beda Fomm. Between 10 June 1940 and 21 January 1941 the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment and the III and V tank battalions' casualties were: 15 officers killed and 14 wounded out of 34, and 148 soldiers killed and 244 wounded out of 538.Assocarri For its short but bloody service in North Africa the regiment was awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valour, while the XX and XXI tank battalions \\"L\\", which the 4th regiment had raised before the war, were each awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. As of 2019 all three medals are attached to the 4th Tank Regiment's war flag and displayed on the regiment's coat of arms. The III Tank Battalion M was also awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valour, which is attached to the 32nd Tank Regiment's flag, while the Silver Medal of Military Valour awarded to the V Tank Battalion M is attached to the war flag of the suspended 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\". The regiment was officially declared lost on 25 January 1941 and reformed on 15 March 1941 in Rome as training unit. For the remainder of the war the regiment raised and trained tank battalions for other units. The first unit the regiment raised was the VIII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" with M13/40 tanks, which joined the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment in North Africa. On 30 April 1941 the VIII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" bis was renamed XI Tank Battalion \\"M\\" after being equipped with M13/40 tanks. The XI battalion then joined the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment. In the meantime the regiment continued to raise new units: * Command Company of the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment (1 June 1941 transferred to Italian Libya) * I Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" (captured French Renault R35 light tanks, renamed CI Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" and transferred to the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment in July 1941) * II Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" (captured French R35 light tanks, renamed CII Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" and transferred to the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment in July 1941) * CC Tank Battalion \\"S35\\" (captured French SOMUA S35 tanks, transferred to the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment in July 1941) * III Flamethrower Tank Battalion (L3 Lf tanks, activated in December 1941) * XVII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M14/41 tanks, activated on 1 February 1942, transferred to the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment) In July 1943 the regiment began with the formation of the II Tank Battalion \\"P\\" with new P 40 tanks, but after Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment was disbanded by the Germans and its materiel transferred to Wehrmacht units.  Cold War  On 1 January 1953 the regiment was raised again as 4th Tankers Regiment and joined the Armored Division \\"Pozzuolo del Friuli\\" in Rome. In the following weeks the regiment activated three battalions armed with M26 Pershing tanks. On 1 May 1958 the regiment was reorganized and renamed as 4th Armored Infantry Regiment, transferred to Legnano and joined the Infantry Division \\"Legnano\\".  20th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pentimalli\\"  Coat of arms of the 20th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pentimalli\\" During the 1975 army reform the 4th Armored Infantry Regiment was disbanded on 29 October 1975 and its II Bersaglieri Battalion became the 2nd Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Governolo\\", while the regiment's XX Tank Battalion became the 20th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pentimalli\\", which received the war flag and traditions of the disbanded regiment. The battalion's number commemorated the XX Tank Battalion \\"L\\", which had served with the 4th regiment in the early stages of the Western Desert Campaign. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 20th Tank Battalion's name commemorated XI Tank Battalion \\"M13/40\\", 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment Second lieutenant Livio Pentimalli, who had distinguished himself during the Battle of Gazala and was killed in action on 21 June 1941 during the Axis capture of Tobruk. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Legnano\\".  Recent times  After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and therefore the \\"Pentimalli\\" battalion was disbanded on 30 January 1991. However as the 4th Tank Regiment is the highest decorated tank unit of the Italian Army it was decided to raise it again and so on 18 September 1992 the 11th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Calzecchi\\" in Ozzano dell'Emilia of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Friuli\\" entered the reraised 4th Tank Regiment. On 1 September 1993 the 6th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Scapuzzi\\" in Civitavecchia of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" was renamed 4th Tank Regiment, while the tank regiment of the \\"Friuli\\" brigade was renamed 33rd Tank Regiment. On 9 October 1995 the regiment disbanded in Civitavecchia and transferred its flag and name to the 31st Tank Regiment in Bellinzago Novarese, which was a unit of the Armored Brigade \\"Centauro\\". In 1996 the regiment's battalion returned to use the name 20th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pentimalli\\". When the Centauro disbanded on 5 October 2002 the 4th Tank Regiment joined the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\". On 11 July 2013 the 4th Tank Regiment disbanded in Bellinzago Novarese and its name and war flag were transferred to the 131st Tank Regiment of the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\" in Persano in Southern Italy.  Current structure  As of 2019 the 4th Tank Regiment consists of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Persano ** Command and Logistic Support Company ** 31st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Andreani\\" *** 1st Tank Company (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 2nd Tank Company (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 3rd Tank Company (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 4th Tank Company (13x Ariete main battle tanks) The Command and Logistic Support Company fields the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon. In total the regiment fields 54x Ariete main battle tanks: 13x per company, plus one for the battalion commander and one for the regiment commander.

She has been described as a key intellectual in the 20th century Nahda, or Arabic Renaissance. Raised in a middle-class Sephardic family, Moyal was fluent in Arabic, French, and English and was tutored by Arabic writer Mu·∏•ammad al-Bakr. She graduated with a degree in 1890, either from the American College for Girls in Beirut or the Syrian Protestant College. Moyal taught at Christian and Jewish schools and translated novels and novellas into Arabic, including the novels of Alexandre Dumas and √âmile Zola. She was active in several women's organizations in Beirut in the 1890s: the Lebanese Women's League, BƒÅk≈´rat S≈´riya (\\"The Dawn of Syria\\") and Nahdat al-NisƒÅ' (\\"The Awakening Women\\"), a group she co-founded. Moyal represented Syria as a member of the Women's Congress at the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago. In 1894, she married medical studied Simon Moyal (Shim‚Äòon Yosef Moyal) and the couple settled in Cairo. While in Cairo, Esther Moyal founded the women's magazine al- øƒÄ æila (The Family) in 1898, which became a weekly newspaper in 1904. The magazine was widely praised and contained articles on modern domestic issues, women's health, literary topics, and global news. She was an outspoken supporter of women's rights. In the pages of The Family, she listed her three principles of feminism: > 1\\\\. Woman is a moral being, possessor of a free will and active conscience > 2\\\\. She is equal to man and the state of her existence is subject to his > direction 3\\\\. Woman has special properties not found in man, and if he is > superior to her in bodily strength and in willpower, then she is superior to > him in the reÔ¨Ånement of her feelings and the precision of her view; given > the means of obtaining an education, she would match him in taste and in > morals. In response to a misogynistic journal article published in 1894, Moyal wrote a series of letters to the editor that summed up her vision of feminism: \\"I say that the woman who spends some small change on ink and paper, and spends her free time reading and writing and does not kill it with idle chatter, knows quite well how to manage her household and raise her children with the moderation, economy, and wisdom that assure both the happiness of her children and richness of her afterlife.\\" Inspired by the Dreyfus Affair, Moyal wrote a book on √âmile Zola's life in 1903. In 1908 (or 1909), the Moyal family moved to Jaffa, where Esther Moyal established an organization for Jewish women. She and Simon became joint editors of the periodical Sawt al- øUthmƒÅniyya (The Voice of Ottomanism) in 1913. This Jewish newspaper written in Arabic countered attacks on Zionism and proposed a vision of a \\"shared homeland\\" in Palestine within the framework of the Ottoman Empire. After Simon's death in 1913, Moyal lived with relatives in Marseilles; she returned to Jaffa in the early 1940s. Her son  ΩAbdallƒÅh (‚ÄòOvadia) Nadƒ´m became a poet. Moyal's life and work presents a vision of a pluralistic Middle East dependent on free and open discourse. In her introduction to a set of biographies of Arabic women, Moyal wrote that she was thankful to live in an era \\"in which a large arena has been opened for the sages to disseminate their truths among peoples; for this has been the biggest ally in the advancement of knowledge and the greatest aid to its promulgation.\\"  References  Category:Lebanese women writers Category:Jewish women writers Category:Lebanese Jews Category:Lebanese journalists Category:1874 births Category:1948 deaths ","title":"Esther Moyal"},{"id":"62403235","text":"Aaron Marcus Evans (born June 17, 1996) is an American basketball player.

During the lifetime of Space Shuttle, Rockwell International and many other organizations studied various Space Shuttle designs. These studies included different ways to increase shuttle payload capability, crew capacity, and developing standalone reusable launch vehicles. A large focus of the program was towards new shuttle boosters and an upgrades to the external tank but also looked to expand NASA's ability to launch deep space missions and build large modular space stations. Many of these concepts and studies would shape the concepts and programs of the 2000s such as Constellation, Orbital Space Plane Program, and Artemis program.  Shuttle-derived vehicles  7.6 Space Shuttle Fairing  Shuttle-C  The Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle was a study by NASA to turn the Space Shuttle launch stack into a dedicated uncrewed cargo launcher. The external tank and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) would be combined with a cargo module that take the place of the shuttle orbiter and include the Space Shuttle Main Engines. A ballistic return pod would be used as the main engine structure and carrie 2-4 SSMEs as well as mount the payload / booster stage. It would be recovered via parachutes in the Australian outback or northern Mexico. Small lifting wings were added to allow more accurate landings. Various Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle concepts were investigated between 1984 and 1995 and it would eventually become known as the Shuttle-C (the Shuttle-C would not include a ballistic return pod and had expendable engines). The Shuttle-C concept would theoretically cut development costs for a heavy launch vehicle by re-using technology developed for the shuttle program. End-of-life and space Shuttle hardware would also have been used. One proposal even involved converting the Columbia or Enterprise into a single-use cargo launcher. Before the loss of Space Shuttle Challenger, NASA had expected about 14 shuttle flights a year. In the aftermath of the Challenger incident, it became clear that this launch rate was not feasible for a variety of reasons. With the Shuttle-C, it was thought that the lower maintenance and safety requirements for the uncrewed vehicle would allow a higher flight rate. The Shuttle-C could also launch an uncrewed lunar lander and propulsion module while a second vehicle would launch the Crew Exploration Vehicle to perform lunar missions. The Shuttle-C would act as the crewed component of the International Lunar Resources Exploration Concept proposed in 1993. In the early 1990s, NASA engineers planning a crewed mission to Mars included a Shuttle-C design to launch six non reusable 80-ton segments to create two Mars ships in Earth orbit. After President George W. Bush called for the end of the Space Shuttle by 2010, these proposed configurations were put aside.HLLV  Magnum  The Magnum was a large Super heavy-lift launch vehicle designed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center during the mid-1990s. The Magnum would have been a booster some tall, on the scale of the Saturn V and was originally designed to carry a human mission to Mars. It was to have used two strap-on side boosters, similar to the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), but using liquid fuel instead. Some designs had the strap-on boosters using wings and jet engines, which would enable them to fly back to the launch area after they were jettisoned in flight. The Magnum was designed to carry around 80 tons of payload into low Earth orbit (LEO). National Launch System  National Launch System  The National Launch System (or New Launch System) was a study authorized in 1991 by President George H. W. Bush to outline alternatives to the Space Shuttle for access to Earth orbit. Shortly thereafter, NASA asked Lockheed Missiles and Space, McDonnell Douglas, and TRW to perform a ten-month study.A Wide Variety of Booster, External Tank, and Propellant Options Were StudiedA series of launch vehicles was proposed, based around the proposed Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) liquid-fuel rocket engine. The STME was to be a simplified, expendable version of the RS-25. The NLS-1 was the largest of three proposed vehicles and would have used a modified Space Shuttle external tank for its core stage. The tank would have fed liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to four STMEs attached to the bottom of the tank. A payload or second stage would have fit atop the core stage, and two detachable Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters would have been mounted on the sides of the core stage as on the Shuttle. Period illustrations suggest that much larger rockets than NLS-1 were contemplated, using multiples of the NLS-1 core stage.  Upgraded boosters  Early studies looked at alternate booster and external tank configurations such as: * SRM options that placed the SRBs inline but aft of the ET * Liquid rocket boosters, both hydrogen and propane to replace the SRBs * Twin and catamaran flyback boosters to replace the SRBs * An engine pod aft of the ET fed from twin fuel tanks where the SRBs would normally be located * An in-line integrated booster/ET with a recoverable aft engine pod * Tandem boosters and ETs in a variety of recoverable concepts * A single booster with multiple ETs (expendable and recoverable)  Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) Project  NASA was planning on replacing the post-Challenger SRBs with a new Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) to be built by Aerojet at a new facility, designed by subcontractor, RUST International, on the location of a canceled Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power plant, at Yellow Creek, Mississippi. The ASRM would have produced additional thrust in order to increase shuttle payload, so that it could carry modules and construction components to the ISS. The ASRM program was canceled in 1993 after robotic assembly systems and computers were on-site and approximately 2 billion dollars spent, in favor of continued use, after design flaw corrections, of the SRB. NASA/MSFC design for Recoverable Liquid Boosters  Recoverable Liquid Booster  A large focus of the NASA/MSFC Shuttle Growth Study contract was upgraded Recoverable Liquid Boosters. The boosters would have a similar flight path fo the solid rocket motors, separating and deploying a parachute for recovery in the Atlantic Ocean. They were to be water-recoverable and used clam shell doors to protect the engines from salt water immersion.  Liquid Fly-back Booster  Liquid Flyback Booster concepts date back to the early 1970s. Original Shuttle boosters were massive piloted fly-back boosters. The concept was studied throughout the 1980s but shelved after the Challenger disaster shut down most Shuttle upgrades. The Flyback booster concept reemerged in 1997 during the NASA Liquid Flyback Booster Study. The concept was abandoned due to the massive complications with the systems and the minimal improvements they would provide. The Shuttle Growth Study built on this background by developing design concepts in great detail for the liquid rocket boosters. The Ares I launch vehicle would have used a Five-Segment SRB  Five-Segment Booster  Prior to the destruction of the in 2003, NASA investigated the replacement of the current 4-segment SRBs with either a 5-segment SRB design or replacing them altogether with liquid \\"flyback\\" boosters using either Atlas V or Delta IV EELV technologies. The 5-segment SRB, which would have required little change to the current shuttle infrastructure, would have allowed the space shuttle to carry an additional of payload in an 51.6¬∞-inclination orbit, eliminate the dangerous \\"Return-to-Launch Site\\" (RTLS) and \\"Trans-Oceanic Abort\\" (TAL) modes, and, by using a so-called \\"dog-leg maneuver\\", fly south- to-north polar orbiting flights from Kennedy Space Center. After the destruction of Columbia, NASA shelved the five-segment SRB for the Shuttle Program, and the three surviving Orbiters, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour were retired in 2011 after the completion of the International Space Station. One five-segment engineering test motor, ETM-03, was fired on October 23, 2003. As part of the Constellation program, the first stage of the Ares I rocket was planned to use five-segment SRBs ‚Äì in September 2009 a five-segment Space Shuttle SRB was static fired on the ground in ATK's desert testing area in Utah. After the Constellation program was canceled in 2011, the new Space Launch System (SLS) was designated to use five-segment boosters. The first test of a SRB for SLS was completed in early 2015, a second test was performed in mid 2016 at Orbital ATK's Promontory, Utah facility.  External Tank Cargo Fairing  Space Shuttle 7.6 and 10.6 Fairing DARPA studied modifying the current external tank design to be able to carry low density payloads in a 7.6 or 10.6 fairing where the oxygen tank was currently. The Shuttle on average would only fly 66% of its payload capability but at nearly 100% of its payload volume. The external tank payload fairing would solve this problem. The oxygen tank would need to be redesigned as a cylindrical tank rather than conical and the clamshell payload fairing would be mounted directly on it. In this configuration the orbiter would launch without any payload. These studies were eventually abandoned due to the fact that the new aerodynamic profile would make a Return to Launch Site (RTLS) maneuver impossible. The proposal was reconfigured as an Aft Cargo Carrier (ACC) to be positioned towards the bottom of the tank rather on top. This idea made it far into development with Martin Marietta contracted to design and fabricate the container. First flights of the ACC were expected in 1986. After the Challenger disaster, the ACC as well as most payload related Shuttle upgrades were canceled.  Modified orbiters  The following are all accounts mentioned or discussed by Carl F. Ehrlich, Jr. in Shuttle Variations And Derivatives That Never Happened - An Historical Review  Stretched orbiter  In anticipation of upgraded boosters for the Shuttle, a design for a stretched orbiter was made. It would have a larger payload bay with an additional in length giving it a payload capacity of expected to carry payloads of up to . A new wing root and carry-through structure was designed to handle the additional weight at landing, keeping the outboard section of the original wings and requiring minimal modification. The barrel section would be attached just forward of the 1305 bulkhead towards the rear of the vehicle.  Humpback orbiter  The Super Guppy's \\"humpback\\" design An undefined need for more payload led to the idea of using the lee side section of the payload bay (at entry angle of attack) could be used as an expanded payload bay. This resulted in a \\"humpback\\" resulting in an outsize cargo vehicle similar to Airbus Beluga or the Aero Spacelines Super Guppy. The hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics during re-entry stayed mostly the same however issues would have most likely occurred at subsonic speeds without a high angle of attack.  Unpowered orbiter  The unpowered test vehicle would have been the basis for the unpowered orbiter As an internal response to the Soviets engineless Buran orbiter, an unpowered Orbiter was designed at Marshall Space Flight Center. A payload bay segment would be added to the rear of the spacecraft and look very similar to the albeit with a few differences. As much equipment as possible would be stored and positioned in the rear of the craft to make up for lost weight and compensate for a lack of engines. The Boeing X-37B, the only CRV and OSP design to make it into production, in a smaller uncrewed scale at least  Crew Emergency Return Vehicle  From the late 1980s to the early 2000s NASA, in one form or another, pursued the Crew Return Vehicle; a small spaceplane / capsule capable of returning crew from a space station in the event of an emergency. Candidates evaluated included an Apollo derived capsule, NASA's HL-20, HL-10, and M2F2, and the Air Force's X-24A. A sub-scale variant of the shuttle was proposed based on the ballistic return pod that was studied for the HLLV. The pressurized crew section would be modified into a lifting body. The main advantage of this design would be the proven technology and re-entry profile of the Shuttle.  High Capacity Orbiter  A conceptual design for a high-capacity orbiter was drawn up. The concept utilized a series of canisters mounted in the payload bay that would carry 68-74 passengers in a double deck configuration similar to a Boeing 747. This moved the center of mass forward requiring minor changes to the wing structure adding more canard-like surfaces to allow more lifting surface. The design would be used for a Von Braun style space station that would need crew capacity in the hundreds.

It is situated northwest of Coquihalla Summit, and southwest of Vicuna Peak, its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains west into headwaters of the East Anderson River, or east into headwaters of the Coldwater River. The mountain was named for the alpaca, as part of the ungulate names theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of the 1965 first ascent party. The mountain's name was officially adopted on March 23, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Alpaca Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Alpaca Peak.

The method can be seen as an extension of Doppler imaging.  Background  Main brain functional imaging technique resolutions Brain activation can either be directly measured by imaging electrical activity of neurons using voltage sensitive dyes, calcium imaging, electroencephalography, or magnetoencephalography, or indirectly by detecting hemodynamic changes in blood flow in the neurovascular systems through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), or Doppler ultrasonography )...Petersen, C. C. (2007). The functional organization of the barrel cortex. Neuron, 56(2), 339-355. Optical based methods generally provide the highest spatial and temporal resolutions; however, due to scattering, they are intrinsically limited to the investigation of the cortex. Thus, they are often used on animal models after partially removing or thinning the skull to allow for the light to penetrate into tissue. fMRI and PET, which measure the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, were the only techniques capable of imaging brain activation in depth. BOLD signal increases when neuronal activation exceeds oxygen consumption, where blood flow increases significantly. In fact, in-depth imaging of cerebral hemodynamic responses by fMRI, being noninvasive, paved the way for major discoveries in neurosciences in the early stage, and is applicable on humans. However, fMRI also suffers limitations. First, the cost and size of MR machines can be prohibitive. Also, spatially resolved fMRI is achieved at the expense of a substantial drop in temporal resolution and/or SNR. As a result, the imaging of transient events such as epilepsy is particularly challenging. Finally, fMRI is not appropriate for all clinical applications. For example, fMRI is rarely performed on infants because of specific issues concerning infant sedation. Like fMRI, Doppler based functional ultrasound approach are based on the neurovascular coupling and are thus limited by the spatiotemporal features of neurovascular coupling as they measure cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes. CBV is a pertinent parameter for functional imaging that is already used by other modalities such as intrinsic optical imaging or CBV-weighted fMRI. The spatiotemporal extent of CBV response was extensively studied. The spatial resolution of sensory-evoked CBV response can go down to cortical column (~100¬µm). Temporally, the CBV impulse response function was measured to typically start at ~0.3 s and peak at ~1 s in response to ultrashort stimuli (300¬µs), which is much slower than the underlying electrical activity.Deffieux, Thomas, et al. ‚ÄúFunctional Ultrasound Neuroimaging: a Review of the Preclinical and Clinical State of the Art.‚Äù Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Elsevier Current Trends, 22 Feb. 2018.  Conventional Doppler based functional imaging approaches  Hemodynamic changes in the brain are often used as a surrogate indicator of neuronal activity to map the loci of brain activity. Major part of the hemodynamic response occurs in small vessels; however, conventional Doppler ultrasound is not sensitive enough to detect the blood flow in such small vessels.  Functional Transcranial Doppler (fTCD)  Ultrasound Doppler imaging can be used to obtain basic functional measurements of brain activity using blood flow. In functional transcranial Doppler sonography, a low frequency (1-3 MHz) transducer is used through the temporal bone window with a conventional pulse Doppler mode to estimate blood flow at a single focal location. The temporal profile of blood velocity is usually acquired in main large arteries such as the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The peak velocity is compared between rest and task conditions or between right and left sides when studying lateralization.Knecht S, Deppe M, Ebner A, Henningsen H, Huber T, Jokeit H, Ringelstein E-B: Noninvasive determination of language lateralization by functional transcranial doppler sonography: a comparison with the Wada test. Stroke 1998, 29:82-86.  Power Doppler  Power Doppler is a Doppler sequence that measures the ultrasonic energy backscattered from red blood cells in each pixel of the image. It provides no information on blood velocity but is proportional to blood volume within the pixel. However, conventional power Doppler imaging lacks sensitivity to detect small arterioles/venules and thus is unable to provide local neurofunctional information through neurovascular coupling.  Ultrasensitive Doppler and functional ultrasound imaging (fUS)  Functional ultrasound imaging was pioneered at ESPCI by Mickael Tanter's team Mac√© E, Montaldo G, Cohen I, Baulac M, Fink M, Tanter M.

Ultrasensitive Doppler principle  Ultrasensitive Doppler relies on ultrafast imaging scanners able to acquire images at thousands of frames per second, thus boosting the power Doppler SNR without any contrast agents. Instead of the line by line acquisition of conventional ultrasound devices, ultra-fast ultrasound takes advantage of successive tilted plane wave transmissions that afterward coherently compounded to form images at high frame rates. Coherent Compound Beamforming consists of the recombination of backscattered echoes from different illuminations achieved on the acoustic pressure field with various angles (as opposed to the acoustic intensity for the incoherent case). All images are added coherently to obtain a final compounded image. This very addition is produced without taking the envelope of the beamformed signals or any other nonlinear procedure to ensure a coherent addition. As a result, coherent adding of several echo waves leads to cancellation of out-of-phase waveforms, narrowing the point spread function (PSF), and thus increasing spatial resolution. A theoretical model demonstrates that the gain in sensitivity of the ultrasensitive Doppler method is due to the combination of the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the gray scale images, due to the synthetic compounding of backscattered echoes and the extensive signal samples averaging due to the high temporal resolution of ultrafast frame rates. The sensitivity was recently further improved using multiple plane wave transmissionsTiran E, Deffieux T, Correia M, Maresca D, Osmanski B-F, Sieu L-A, Bergel A, Cohen I, Pernot M, Tanter M: Multiplane wave imaging increases signal-to-noise ratio in ultrafast ultrasound imaging. Physics in Medicine and Biology 2015, 60:8549-8566. and advanced spatiotemporal clutter filters for better discrimination between low blood flow and tissue motion. Ultrasound researchers have been using ultrafast imaging research platforms with parallel acquisition of channels and custom sequences programming to investigate ultrasensitive Doppler/fUS modalities. A custom real-time high-performance GPU beamforming code with a high data transfer rate (several GBytes per second) must then be implemented to perform imaging at high frame rate. Acquisitions can also typically easily provide gigabytes of datas depending on acquisition duration. Ultrasensitive Doppler has a typical 50-200 ¬µm spatial resolution depending on the ultrasound frequency used . It features a temporal resolution in the tens of milliseconds, can image the full depth of the brain and can provide 3D angiographyDemene C, Tiran E, Sieu LA, Bergel A, Gennisson JL, Pernot M, Deffieux T, Cohen I, Tanter M: 4D microvascular imaging based on ultrafast Doppler tomography. Neuroimage 2016..  functional Ultrasound imaging  This signal boost enables the sensitivity required to map subtle blood variations in small arterioles (down to 1mm/s) related to neuronal activity. By applying an external stimulus such as a sensory, auditory or visual stimulation, it is then possible to construct a map of brain activation from the ultrasensitive Doppler movie. fUS measures indirectly cerebral blood volume which provides an effect size close to 20% and as such is quite more sensitive than fMRI whose BOLD response is typically only a couple of percents. Correlation maps or statistical parametric maps can be constructed to highlight the activated areas. fUS has been shown to have a spatial resolution on the order 100 micrometers at 15MHz in ferrets and is sensitive enough to perform single trial detection in awake primatesDizeux, A., Gesnik, M., Ahnine, H. et al. Functional ultrasound imaging of the brain reveals propagation of task-related brain activity in behaving primates. Nat Commun 10, 1400 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09349-w. Other fMRI-like modalities such as functional connectivity can also be implemented. Commercial scanners with specialized hardware and softwarehttps://iconeus.com/ should enable fUS to rapidly expand behind ultrasound research labs to the neuroscience community.  4D functional ultrasound imaging  Some researchers conducted 4D functional ultrasound imaging of whole-brain activity in rodents. Currently, two different technological solutions are proposed for the acquisition of 3D and 4D fUS data, each with its own advantages and drawbacks . The first is a tomographic approach based on motorized translation of linear probes. This approach proved to be a successful method for several applications such as 3D retinotopic mapping in the rodent brain and 3D tonotopic mapping of the auditory system in ferrets . The second approach relies on high frequency 2D matrix array transducer technology coupled with a high channel count electronic system for fast 3D imaging. To counterbalance the intrinsically poor sensitivity of matrix elements, they devised a 3D multiplane-wave scheme with 3D spatiotemporal encoding of transmit signals using Hadamard coefficients. For each transmission, the backscattered signals containing mixed echoes from the different plane waves are decoded using the summation of echoes from successive receptions with appropriate Hadamard coefficients. This summation enables the synthetic building of echoes from a virtual individual plane wave transmission with a higher amplitude. Finally, they perform coherent compounding beamforming of decoded echoes to produce 3D ultrasonic images and apply a spatiotemporal clutter filter separating blood flow from tissue motion to compute a power Doppler volume, which is proportional to the cerebral blood volume.Rabut, C., Correia, M., Finel, V., Pezet, S., Pernot, M., Deffieux, T., & Tanter, M.

Applications  Functional ultrasound imaging has a wide range of applications in research and in clinical practice.  Preclinical applications  Preclinical applications of fUS imaging fUS can benefit in monitoring cerebral function in the whole brain which is important to understanding how the brain works on a large scale under normal or pathological conditions. The ability to image cerebral blood volume at high spatiotemporal resolution and with high sensitivity using fUS could be of great interest for applications in which fMRI reaches its limits, such as imaging of epileptic-induced changes in blood volume.Mac√©, E., Montaldo, G., Cohen, I. et al.

The podcast focuses on left-wing analysis of political issues and events, particularly those concerning deceased financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The title of the podcast is a parodic reference to the QAnon conspiracy theory. History and content TrueAnon is hosted by Brace Belden, a left-wing internet personality noted for fighting with the People's Protection Units in the Syrian Civil War, and Liz Franczak, a writer for The Baffler and Deadspin. Belden and Franczak met in the early 2000s, through San Francisco's punk music scene. The hosts, who identify as Marxists, developed an interest in the Epstein case after Gawker published the contents of Epstein's personal address book in 2015, which established Epstein's connections to multiple influential figures in politics, finance, academia, and entertainment. Following Epstein's arrest in July 2019, Belden and Franczak noted how many of the details of the Epstein case, such as his connections to U.S. intelligence agencies, were not covered in the mainstream press. TrueAnon was thus conceived to explore how \\"the fascination with Epstein is part of a larger story about the rot at the heart of the global elite,\\" and how this reveals \\"larger class antagonisms within the United States.\\" The first episode of TrueAnon was released on July 23, 2019. Branding itself as \\"the only non-pedophile podcast,\\" TrueAnon combines elements of the true crime genre and the dirtbag left, the rhetorical style most closely associated with Chapo Trap House defined by \\"subversive, populist vulgarity.\\" In addition to covering the Epstein case, TrueAnon devotes analysis and discussion to topics such as human trafficking, Medicare for All, Silicon Valley, academia, finance, and non-profit organizations. While TrueAnon covers material that has been described as conspiracy theory, Belden and Franczak assert that the podcast engages in historical materialism, focusing on \\"the power structures that produced Epstein in the first place\\" rather than a \\"fixed theory of Epstein‚Äôs death.\\" Notable guests who have appeared on the podcast include Epstein accuser Maria Farmer and musician Azealia Banks.  Episode guide  As of October 19, 2020, 109 episodes of TrueAnon have been released.https://www.patreon.com/TrueAnonPod/posts Reception TrueAnon has been positively received by critics. GQ described the podcast as possessing a \\"one-of-a-kind flair you won't get anywhere else,\\" offering praise for the quality of the podcast's research. Journalist Jeet Heer cited TrueAnon as one of the few left-wing outlets to discuss the Epstein case in detail, compared to \\"the reluctance of the mainstream media to tackle the topic for fear of seeming conspiratorial.\\" Journalist Glenn Greenwald has also offered praise for the podcast and its coverage of the 2016 Nevada caucus. , TrueAnon is the fifth-ranked podcast on Patreon and the 14th ranked account on the site overall, as measured by number of patrons.

He is considered one of Japan's greatest guitar players. In 2003, Char was ranked by HMV Japan at number 38 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. Rolling Stone Japan ranked his album Psyche number 36 on their 2007 list of the greatest Japanese rock albums of all time. Char came in third in a 2011 goo poll on who the Japanese people thought was the best guitarist to represent the country. Char was named the greatest Japanese guitarist in a 2017 list by Guitar Magazine, as voted on by professional musicians, and in a 2019 public poll held by goo. His song \\"A Fair Wind\\" was named the 34th best guitar instrumental by Young Guitar Magazine in 2019. Char endorses Fender, with whom he has signature model guitars. He also has signature models with ESP. Career Char started learning piano in elementary school, and playing guitar at age eight. Although he listened to various guitarists, it was Eric Clapton who got him hooked on the instrument. Char began work as a session guitarist while still in junior high school. At 17, Char formed the band Smoky Medicine in 1973 with Mari Kaneko. Although they disbanded the following year, they garnered much attention in the industry, with Guitar Magazine later calling them possibly the \\"most famous amateur band\\" in Japan. In 1976, Char made his solo debut on Pony Canyon with the single \\"Navy Blue\\" in June and the album Char in September. He played guitar on Joe Yamanaka's 1977 hit song \\"Proof of the Man\\", which sold over half a million copies. Char reprised his guitar part for Exile Atsushi's cover of the song in 2017. In 1978, he teamed up with Johnny Yoshinaga and Louise Louis Kabe to form the supergroup Johnny, Louis & Char. The following year they played a free concert at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall, which was recorded and released as their first album Free Spirit. After two studio albums, they changed their name to Pink Cloud in 1982 upon changing record labels. In 1986, they collaborated with Kiyoshiro Imawano for the songs \\"S.F.\\" and \\"Private\\" used in the Prefectural Earth Defense Force anime. Originally disbanded in 1994, the members played together in various combinations several times until Yoshinaga's death in 2012. Char's 1981 album U.S.J was co-produced by Steve Lukather and also features Jeff Porcaro and David Foster. Char co-composed and played on the 1986 song \\"Last Wish Onajiirono Christmas\\" with Katsuhiko Nakagawa. He reprised his guitar part on a 2014 cover of the song by Nakagawa's daughter, Shoko. Char established his own record label in 1987, and released two solo albums the following year. Also in 1988, he formed the band Psychedelix with Jimmy Copley and Jaz Lochrie. The following year, he teamed up with Osamu Ishida to form the acoustic duo Baho. Char spent 1999 touring Japan with Carmine Appice and Tim Bogert in a unit called CB&A;, with a live album released the following year. Char collaborated with Tomoyasu Hotei for the 2006 single \\"Stereocaster\\". The following year he joined Hotei and Brian Setzer for a short joint tour. In 2009, Char established the record label Zicca Records. Char released six cover albums in 2010, each one covering songs by a different act that inspired him; Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, The Beatles, The Ventures, Jimmy Page, and Jimi Hendrix. Since 2011, Char has taken part in several covers of famous songs organized by Playing for Change. For 2015's Rock+, which celebrated his 60th birthday, Char collaborated with many different musicians, including his son Jesse, Hotei, Keisuke Kuwata, Hama Okamoto, and Masaharu Fukuyama. That year he also held a free concert at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall on July 15, just like he had done in 1979 as part of Johnny, Louis & Char. Char was one of many guitar guests on Kazumi Watanabe's 2016 album Guitar is Beautiful KW45, featured on two songs. Personal life Char is married to former fashion model Kanna S.

The album was executive produced by David Foster. The album debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 selling 99,000 copies. \\"Get Over Yourself\\" had been released in March of 2001 and was a top ten hit in the United States and went to number one in Canada. Popstars received only moderate promotion due to financial restraints from the group's label, which was heading towards bankruptcy. Due to this, album sales were less than anticipated. Popstars did, however, go on to sell 500,000 copies in the United States, receiving a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Canada, Popstars peaked at number 17 and failed to match the success in the United States. The album was also released in Australia, United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil.  Composition  Eden's Crush recorded the album from November 2000 through February 2001. The album had to be recorded quickly in order to fit into the timing of the television show Popstars. David Foster, who was the lead producer for the album, assembled the team of producers, songwriters, sound engineers and musicians to work on the album.  Release and promotion  Popstars was released in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan and Brazil by London-Sire Records and 143 Records on May 1, 2001. Several of the album's tracks including \\"What's Good 4 the Goose\\", \\"Get Over Yourself\\", \\"Anywhere But Here\\", \\"Love This Way\\", \\"No Drama\\", I Wanna Be Free\\", \\"1,000 Words (Mil Palabras)\\", \\"You Know I Can\\" and \\"Promise Me\\" were featured heavily during the run of the Popstars television series. The original title of the album was to be Heaven. The group did a promo tour in the United States during the album's first week of release, including radio interviews and televised appearances on the Late Show with David Letterman, Live With Regis and Kelly, The View and MTV's Total Request Live. Other televised appearances include local WB network morning shows and on the Spanish-language programs ¬°Despierta Am√©rica!, El Gordo y la Flaca and S√°bado Gigante. Unknown to the public and the group (to a certain point), the group's label was going bankrupt and did not have the financial means to promote the album past August of 2001.  Singles  \\"Get Over Yourself\\" was the debut single released on March 13, 2001. The single was a hit, peaking in the United States at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. \\"Love This Way\\" was the group's final single which was released in July of 2001. Due to the label's financial troubles, the song was made into a promotional single with a limited amount of CD singles released in stores in the United States only.  Commercial performance  Popstars debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 selling 99,000 copies in its first week of release. The album went on to sell 500,000 copies in the United States, receiving a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July of 2001. In Canada, it peaked at number 17 on the Canadian Albums Chart. However, the album did not chart in Australia, United Kingdom, Japan or Brazil.  Track listing  On the first pressing, track 13 was not listed. Future pressings do include the track in the track listing. The CD was also released as an Enhanced CD in the United States and Canada. This version included behind the scenes content, photo and video galleries of the group and links to the group's official website and the Popstars official website.

She received a bachelor's and a master's degree in fashion history from National University of Ochanomizu and studied at Paris-Sorbonne University. Currently, Fukai is the Director and Chief Curator of the Kyoto Costume Institute. Her catalogue of the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute has been published in Japanese, English, French, and German by popular German arts books publisher Taschen. Fukai has stated in interviews that the future of Japanese fashion is \\"basic clothing at reasonable prices.\\" Her scholarship emphasizes the relationship between tradition and innovation in Japanese fashion throughout history, with a particular focus on designs produced in Japan since the 1980s, the subject of her 2010 traveling exhibition Future Beauty: 30 Years of Japanese Fashion. The exhibition was the first comprehensive survey of Japanese avant-garde fashion designers from this period and focused on the works of Issey Miyake, Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto, and Junya Watanabe among others. The exhibition began at the Barbican Art Gallery and traveled widely, including to the Seattle Art Museum. One of the main differences she posits between Western and Japanese clothing is, in her own words: \\"In Europe, clothing is definitely external to the body. In Japan it is a coming together of the body and the garment ... [that] derives partly from the process of dressing and the rituals ‚Äì the layering and layering of the kimono, for example.\\" Her work on Japonism in fashion, inside and outside of Japan, examines western ideas of Japanese dress and how these ideas and styles were re-imported for a Japanese audience. She has received numerous awards for her work, including honors from the Japanese Commissioner for Cultural Affairs in 2008 and the Academy of Japonism in Japan in 2000; in 2004, she received an honorary doctoral degree from her alma mater, the National University of Ochanomizu.

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. The regiment is a training unit under the Army Military Command \\"Sardegna\\" and tasked to manage the Capo Teulada Training Range and provide the opposing force for visiting units.  History   Formation  The regiment was formed on 15 September 1936 in Vercelli as 1st Tank Infantry Regiment with four battalions: I, II, and III assault tanks battalions and the IV Breach Tank Battalion. The assault tanks battalions fielded L3/35 tankettes, while the breach tanks battalion fielded Fiat 3000 light tanks. The regiment's initial structure was: * 1st Tank Infantry Regiment, in Vercelli ** I Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Ribet\\", in Turin (L3/35 tankettes) ** II Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Berardi\\", in Alessandria (L3/35 tankettes) ** III Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Paselli\\", in Monza (L3/35 tankettes) ** IV Breach Tanks Battalion, in Vercelli (Fiat 3000 light tanks) ** 1st Tank Training Center, in Vercelli ** 1st Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Vercelli On 1 January 1938 the regiment received the XXIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Stennio\\", which had returned from Libya and on 30 November 1938 it ceded the IV Breach Tanks Battalion to the forming 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, while receiving on the same date the IV Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Monti\\" from the 2nd Tank Infantry Regiment, the V Breach Tanks Battalion from the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment, and the XXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Coralli\\", which had returned from Libya. In 1939 the regiment ceded the III Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Paselli\\" to the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, and the IV Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Monti\\" to the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment. On 6 November 1939 the regiment ceded the XXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Coralli\\" and XXIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Stennio\\" to the forming 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment, and renamed the V Breach Tanks Battalion as CCCXXIII Breach Tanks Battalion, which soon after moved to Riva del Garda and was ceded to the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment. In April 1940 tank battalions were renamed and the regiment entered World War II with the following structure: * 1st Tank Infantry Regiment, in Vercelli ** I Tank Battalion \\"L\\", in Turin (L3/35 tankettes, former I Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Ribet\\") ** 1st Tank Training Center, in Vercelli ** 1st Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Vercelli  World War II  The regiment's baptism of fire came during the Italian invasion of France, when the regiment advanced with its battalion into Southern France. In early summer 1940 the regiment's I Tank Battalion \\"L\\" was sent to North Africa for the upcoming Italian invasion of Egypt, where it joined the X Army Corps. The regimental headquarters arrived in Libya in early July and on 20 July 1940 the 1st Armored Infantry Regiment's headquarter arrived in Mechili, where it remained and fulfilled administrative and logistic duties, while the regiment's commanding officer Colonel Pietro Aresca led the Babini Group's I Tankers Grouping (also known as \\"Aresca Group\\"). The regiment's headquarter remained in Mechili until 24 January 1941, when advancing British forces drove the Italians out of Mechili. As the regimental command had been destroyed during the British advance the regiment was declared disbanded on 8 February 1941. The regiment was reformed on 15 March 1941 in Vercelli as training unit. For the remainder of the war the regiment trained replacement tank crews for the deployed units and occasionally also new battalions: * I, II, IV, and X tank battalions \\"L\\" to replace units lost in the North African campaign * X Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" with M14/41 tanks for the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment (later transferred to the 132nd Tank Regiment) * XV Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" with M14/41 tanks for the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment (half of the XV was raised by the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment) On 1 August the regiment began with the formation of the I Tank Battalion \\"P\\" with new P 40 tanks, but after Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment was disbanded by the Germans and its materiel transferred to Wehrmacht units.  Cold War  Immediately after ratification of the peace treaty between the allies and Italy on 15 September 1947 the Italians began to rebuild their army. A first tank battalion with M4 Sherman tanks was raised in spring 1948 in Rome, which moved in June to Casarsa della Delizia to make room for a second M4 Sherman tank battalion. On 10 July 1948 the two battalions were used to form the 1st Tankers Regiment in Rome, which joined the Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\" on 7 September 1948. The brigade had been reformed earlier on 1 June 1948 without units. Regiment and brigade moved in fall 1948 to the Friuli Venezia Giulia region - the regiment to Casarsa della Delizia and the brigade headquarters to Pordenone. On 1 April 1949 the 1st Tankers Regiment was renamed 132nd Tankers Regiment \\"Ariete\\". On 11 May 1959 the army activated the Armored Units Training Center in Teulada. On 1 May 1974 the center was renamed 1st Armored Infantry Regiment and received the war flag and traditions of the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment. On 9 March 1993 the name was changed to 1st Armored Regiment.

It passes by two subway stations (King and St. Andrew) on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity. The corridor was created by the King Street Pilot Project to improve streetcar reliability on downtown King Street. The corridor went into operation on November 12, 2017, and was made permanent by City Council on April 16, 2019. The corridor is long and spans 18 street intersections. Description The corridor extends along King Street between Jarvis Street at the east end and Bathurst Street at the west. Private vehicles are allowed to use the corridor, but they may only travel up to three blocks along it before they are required to turn right out of the corridor. Other private vehicle restrictions include: * Through traffic is allowed only for TTC vehicles, emergency vehicles, bicycles and road maintenance vehicles at all but two intersections. Because of high pedestrian volumes crossing the street, through traffic is allowed at Bay and John Streets. However, between 10pm and 5am, taxis may also pass through intersections. * At most signalized intersections, automobile and truck traffic on King Street must turn right rather than continuing through. Simcoe and York Streets are exceptions as they are one-way streets. * No left turns are allowed for automobile and truck traffic, except eastbound at Bathurst Street and westbound at Jarvis Street at the two ends of the corridor. * On-street parking is prohibited, but some space is provided for loading zones and taxi stands. Planters, patios and artwork added along the streetcar tracks as part of the King Street Pilot Project Most streetcar stops are far-side, with only the westbound stops at Portland and Bathurst Streets being near-side. Passengers board streetcars from delineated loading areas in the curb lane with barricades at each end to protect waiting passengers from traffic. Downtown Express buses along the corridor have separate stops from streetcars to avoid passenger and vehicle congestion. Prior to the pilot project, the two curb lanes along King Street were used for rush-hour traffic and for parking in the off-hours. After the creation of the corridor, space in the curb lanes was converted for other uses such as seating, patios and bicycle parking in order to make the street more pedestrian-friendly. In 2018, three dozen streetscape improvements were made including eighteen patios, two mini-parks and a number of spaces for artists and public displays. Fifteen patios were associated with private businesses (usually restaurants) that must pay the City a fee; three other patios were sponsored by businesses for public use. One space by Roy Thomson Hall is decorated by a wall of plastic crates holding planters separating a sitting area from the streetcar lanes. Another space east of Church Street has a road mural called \\"King's Buried Treasure\\" to commemorate former creeks long since buried.

Route 503 Kingston Road was upgraded from rush-hour only service to include midday service on a trial basis effective September 3, 2019. Service history Initially, the principal routes using the corridor were the 504 King and 514 Cherry, which overlapped through the corridor. However, effective October 7, 2018, the 514 Cherry route was discontinued and replaced by two new branches of route 504 King, both of which also overlap through the corridor. On February 20, 2018, route 503 Kingston Rd was modified from rush-hour only to full weekday service (evenings excluded) to increase capacity to support ridership in the corridor, which had increased along downtown King Street during the King Street Pilot Project. Along with this change, route 503 was extended west from York Street to Spadina Avenue and turned back at Charlotte Loop. As of January 7, 2019, the 503 route returned to shuttle bus operation to accommodate some construction projects; the 503 terminus was moved back to York Street. Effective September 3, 2019, 503 Kingston Rd service was again upgraded to run midday as well as during rush hours on weekdays. On September 3, 2019, the TTC reintroduced rush-hour route 508 Lake Shore. It runs through the corridor eastbound in the morning peak period, and both ways during the afternoon peak. On November 25, 2019, five TTC Downtown Express bus routes began operating along the corridor. Effective November 25, 2019, on a trial basis, the Downtown Express buses were relocated to the corridor in order to avoid traffic on their former route along Richmond and Adelaide Streets. All Downtown Express routes (141‚Äì145) pass both St. Andrew and King subway stations. Development of the corridor Earlier efforts Signs indicating streetcar lanes are only for TTC vehicles and taxis during the rush hours In 1993, the streetcar tracks along King Street between Dufferin and Parliament Streets were made reserved lanes for streetcars and taxis only during rush hours. Other road traffic was to use the curb lanes during rush hours when parking and stopping would be prohibited. This effort to improve rush-hour streetcar service failed as there was insufficient police enforcement to prevent illegal parking, resulting in motorists continuing to drive on the tracks. On March 22, 2007, the TTC proposed a pilot project for a transit mall along King Street, to be implemented in mid-2008. The proposal suggested reserving the centre lanes for streetcars and making a single lane in one direction available to private vehicles, taxis and delivery vehicles, alternating the lane direction on different blocks. The street would have been closed entirely to through traffic and streetcars would run at grade, not in a raised median. This arrangement could eventually have led to the trial implementation of a transit mall on King between Bay Street and Spadina Avenue, with hopes of eventually closing King to cars from Dufferin Street to Parliament Street. Local merchants and restaurateurs opposed the proposed transit mall. King Street Pilot Project While the 2007 pilot project was not implemented, proposals for some kind of transit priority corridor were revived in 2016 when the City of Toronto's \\"King Street Visioning Study\\" proposed a transit and pedestrian corridor on King Street through downtown. In February 2017, as part of the King Street Pilot Study, City staff proposed three options, one of which would be submitted to City Council for approval in July and implementation as a pilot in the fourth quarter of 2017. One of the three options was similar to the 2007 proposal. All three options forbade left turns, and two options forced automobile traffic to leave King Street by a right turn after travelling only one block. All three options aimed to reduce automobile interference with streetcar operation between Bathurst Street in the west and either Parliament Street or Jarvis Street in the east. On July 6, 2017, Toronto City Council‚Äîby a vote of 34 to 4‚Äîapproved a one-year, $1.5-million pilot project to improve streetcar service along King Street between Bathurst and Jarvis Streets. The project would limit automobiles to travel only one block before being forced to turn right, and left turns would be prohibited. However, over the objections of the TTC, Council granted taxi cabs an exemption on the ban against through traffic between 10pm and 5am. The TTC said that King Street is busy overnight, forcing streetcars to slow down to between . On October 23, 2017, the City of Toronto published a plan for the King Street Transit Pilot showing the location of streetcar stops and traffic restrictions between Bathurst and Jarvis Streets. The pilot project went into operation on November 12, 2017, and was expected to last one year. The following changes were made for the pilot: * Painted road lines and Jersey barriers were used to indicate lane restrictions. * Traffic signals and signage were modified to indicate turn restrictions. * Most streetcar stops were moved to the far-side. However, during the pilot phase, existing near- side transit shelters were not moved. * At Transit Control, the TTC assigned a dedicated manager to monitor 504 King and 514 Cherry streetcars along King Street. Temporary far-side stop erected for the King Street Pilot Project After 16 days of operation, University of Toronto (U of T) researchers determined that the transit mall had reduced the mean travel time for streetcars by 24% westbound (from 22.8 to 17.3 minutes) and 20% eastbound (from 20.6 to 16.4 minutes) during the evening rush hour. Only 1.3% of streetcars took more than 25 minutes to travel between Jarvis and Bathurst Streets during the evening rush hour versus 19% prior to the pilot. However, crowding on routes 504 and 514 had increased, forcing riders to wait for room to board as several streetcars passed; improved travel times increased demand for streetcar service through the transit mall. To address the increased demand, the TTC started to assign two Flexity streetcars, plus future Flexity deliveries from Bombardier, to route 504. This was in addition to the 10 Flexity streetcars on route 514 and 44 CLRVs on route 504. The City's Transportation Services department had yet to adjust traffic light timings to give more green-light time for streetcars within the transit mall. By December 12, 2017, City staff reported that the transit mall had reduced streetcar travel time during the morning rush hours from 15.3 to 14.9 minutes eastbound and from 15.2 to 14.3 minutes westbound. During the evening rush hours, travel time was reduced from 18.9 to 17.6 minutes eastbound and 19 minutes to 16.4 minutes westbound. The mall allowed better spacing of streetcars, reducing the problem of streetcar bunching. The mall had little impact on traffic on neighbouring streets. Statistics differed between the U of T analysis and the City's because different pre-pilot periods were selected and because the U of T study had collected data for a shorter period. At the time of the City's analysis, traffic signal timing had not yet been changed to improve streetcar speeds. By mid-January 2018, the TTC had released its own analysis, which found that morning rush hour ridership had increased 25% along King Street after implementation of the transit mall and that the average travel time through the transit mall (Bathurst Street to Jarvis Street) had decreased by 14%. The TTC temporarily replaced streetcars on routes 505 Dundas and 506 Carlton with buses and reassigned those streetcars to other routes, such as 504 King, to handle crowding from increased ridership. The Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association reported that 26 restaurants located within the King Street theatre district saw revenue drop by 41% (comparing December 2016 with December 2017). Restaurateurs attributed the declining revenue to driving restrictions and the removal of on-street parking within the corridor. The City started a campaign to attract customers to local businesses along the mall, such as a public space design competition, street performers, warming stations and special promotions. In January 2018, to attract automobile customers, the City offered up to $10 in free parking at municipal parking lots in the area. By May and June 2018, streetcar ridership along King Street had increased overall by 11% since the King Street Pilot Project had started. Ridership had increased 35% in the morning rush hours and 27% during the evening rush hours. Average travel time at midday was reduced by 2 minutes and by 4 to 5 minutes during the afternoon. 85% of streetcars operated on a headway of 4 minutes. The City found that retail business in the area had increased by 0.3%, although some restaurateurs in the John Street area still complained of lost business due to the pilot. In early July 2018, the City activated transit signal priority (TSP) along the transit mall. With this improvement, streetcar travel time along the mall was reduced on average by 30 to 126 seconds depending on direction; the change particularly benefitted eastbound streetcars during the evening rush hours. TSP reduced the chances of a streetcar being stopped at a red light, saving an average of 8 seconds per signaled intersection. A transponder on the streetcar notifies TSP of a streetcar approaching a signaled intersection; TSP could then extend a green light or shorten a red light facing a streetcar. On December 13, 2018, Toronto City Council voted 19 to 3 in favour of extending the pilot until July 31, 2019. City staff wanted more time to collect and analyze data before recommending whether to make the pilot permanent. Permanent corridor A patio with Muskoka chairs within the transit priority corridor next to an entrance to King station In April 2019, a City staff report dubbed the transit mall the \\"King Street Transit Priority Corridor\\". On April 16, 2019, City Council voted 22 to 3 in favour of making the pilot permanent. From the beginning of the pilot, weekday rush-hour ridership had increased from 72,000 to 84,000 passengers, while people movement had also increased and vehicle traffic had decreased in the pilot area. City staff were considering adaptations of the pilot to other routes. Other cities were examining the pilot to possibly emulate it. However, City staff reported that growth in retail spending fell from 2.5% the year before the pilot to 1.7% during the project. In November 2019, new raised streetcar loading platforms were installed at the Portland Street and Peter Street stops for evaluation. Both ends of the platform have a bicycle ramp to allow the platform to double as part of a bicycle path. Cyclists are not allowed to cross the platform when passengers are boarding or alighting a streetcar. When a streetcar is not present, waiting streetcar passengers must stand in a white-coloured area behind a yellow tactile divider to allow bicycles to pass. The new platforms use former road space to make more room for pedestrians.

It was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2019 and placed in Schedule V in March 2020. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Cenobamate is a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker. It is a selective blocker of the inactivated state of VGSCs, preferentially inhibiting persistent sodium current. It has been proposed that cenobamate additionally enhances presynaptic release of Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby increasing inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission.  History  The safety and efficacy of cenobamate to treat partial-onset seizures was established in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that enrolled 655 adults. In these studies, patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization for an average of approximately 24 years and median seizure frequency of 8.5 seizures per 28 days during an 8-week baseline period. During the trials, doses of 100, 200, and 400 milligrams (mg) daily reduced the percent of seizures per 28 days compared with the placebo group. The recommended maintenance dose, following a titration (medication adjustment) period, is 200 mg daily; however, some patients may need an additional titration to 400 mg daily, the maximum recommended dose, based on their clinical response and tolerability.

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the regiment was lastassigned to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". On 10 January 2020 the regiment was reformed as a reconnaissance unit and received the name, flag and traditions of the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" (15th).  History   Formation  The regiment was formed on 15 July 1937 in Siena as 31st Tank Infantry Regiment with three tank battalions, which were ceded by three of the four active tank infantry regiments: * 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, in Siena ** I Breach Tanks Battalion, (Fiat 3000 light tanks, from the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment) ** II Breach Tanks Battalion (Fiat 3000 light tanks, from the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment) ** III Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Paselli\\", (L3/35 tankettes, from the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment) On the same day the 31st regiment and the 5th Bersaglieri Regiment entered the newly raised I Armored Brigade. In November 1938 the regiment received the VII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Vezzani\\" from the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment. From 7 to 12 April 1939 the brigade participated in the Italian invasion of Albania. During operations in Albania the army realized that the Fiat 3000 light tanks of the two breach tanks battalions were obsolete and it was decided to remove them from frontline service. On 20 April 1939 the brigade was dissolved in Albania and the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment and the 5th Bersaglieri Regiment entered the newly raised 131st Armored Division \\"Centauro\\", which was activated in Siena in Italy. On the same day the 31st regiment transferred its two breach tanks battalions to the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment respectively the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment. On 30 May 1939 the VIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Bettoia\\" and the X Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Menzinger\\" arrived from to the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment. During summer of 1939 the division command, the newly raised 131st Armored Artillery Regiment, and the two assault tanks battalions moved to Tirana in Albania, where the Centauro underwent a period of intense training. In Albania the III Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Paselli\\" was renamed XXXI Tank Battalion \\"L\\" ( \\"Light\\"), as were the other units of the regiment in April 1940. The regiment entered World War II with the following structure: * 31st Tank Infantry Regiment ** I Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former VII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Vezzani\\") ** II Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former VIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Bettoia\\") ** III Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former X Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Menzinger\\") ** IV Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former XXXI Tank Battalion \\"L\\")  World War II  Early in the war the regiment received the IV Tank Battalion \\"M\\" from the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment. The battalion had been formed with the personnel of the disbanded I Breach Tanks Battalion and equipped with M13/40 tanks. In 1940-41 the regiment fought in the Greco- Italian War and in 1941 it participated in the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia. For its service in Greece and Albania the regiment was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour. In September 1941 the regiment arrived in Travesio in Friuli, where it was supposed to switch completely to M14/41 tanks. However due to a shortage of tanks the regiment was only able to muster the LI Tank Battalion \\"M\\" with the personnel of the disbanded III and IV tanks battalions \\"L\\". At the end of October the regiment moved its headquarter to Pordenone and it was decided to disband the two last \\"L\\" battalions. The regiment fielded the following units at the end of October 1941: * 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, in Pordenone ** IV Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\", in Pordenone (M14/41 tanks) ** XII Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\", in Aviano (M14/41 tanks, from the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment) ** LI Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\", in Casarsa della Delizia (M14/41 tanks) Already in November the XII Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" was transferred to the newly formed 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment for service in North Africa. Enroute one transport carrying the tanks for one of the companies of the XII battalion was sunk by British warplanes in the Mediterranean. After the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment arrived in Libya in February 1942 it had to cede two of its battalions: the XI to the 101st Motorized Division \\"Trieste\\" and the X to the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment of the 132nd Armored Division \\"Ariete\\" to replace the losses these two divisions had suffered during the Panzer Army Africa's advance to Gazala in the preceding weeks. To bring the 133rd regiment back up to strength the IV and LI tank battalions were sent to North Africa. Back in Italy the 31st regiment received the XIII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" M13/40 tanks from the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment. However the XIII battalion had to be sent to Libya during summer 1942 to replace the losses suffered by the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment in the battles of Gazala, Bir Hakeim, Mersa Matruh, and First El Alamein. After the Axis defeat in the Second Battle of El Alamein the 31st regiment was sent to North Africa to bolster Rommel's retreating Panzer Armee Afrika for the Tunisian campaign. The regiment departed Italy with the following battalions: * 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, in Pordenone ** XIV Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M14/41 tanks) ** XV Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M14/41 tanks) ** XVII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M14/41 tanks) After arriving in Libya the regiment ceded the XIV battalion to the \\"Cantaluppi\\" Group, an ad- hoc formation commanded by Colonel Gaetano Cantaluppi, which had absorbed the remnants of the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment and 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment after the Second Battle of El Alamein. The 31st regiment distinguished itself at the battles of El Agheila and El Guettar, before being dissolved in early April 1943 after having suffered heavy losses in the Battle of El Guettar. The regiment was officially declared lost on 12 April 1943 and reformed on the same day in Siena with the XIX Mixed Tank Battalion, which fielded one M14/41 and one M15/42 company. Plans to expand the battalion and reform the regiment were thwarted by the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943, and the subsequent occupation of Italy by the Germans, who disbanded the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment.  Cold War  On 15 January 1951 the regiment was raised again in Verona as 31st Tankers Regiment and joined the Armored Division \\"Centauro\\". Initially the 31st had only one M4 Sherman tank battalion, but in 1953 the 132nd Tankers Regiment \\"Ariete\\" ceded a M4 Sherman tank battalion to the 31st. In 1955 the regiment moved to Bellinzago Novarese and in December 1958 the regiment was renamed 31st Tank Regiment.  1st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Cracco\\"  Coat of arms of the 1st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Cracco\\" Coat of arms of the 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\" During the 1975 army reform the 31st Tank Regiment was disbanded on 20 October 1975 and its I Tank Battalion became the 1st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Cracco\\", while its II Tank Battalion became the 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\", and its XXVIII Bersaglieri Battalion became the 28th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Oslavia\\". The war flag and traditions of the disbanded regiment were assigned to the 1st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Cracco\\", whose number commemorated the I Tank Battalion \\"L\\", which had served with the regiment in the Greco-Italian War and the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 1st Tank Battalion's name commemorated 31st Tank Infantry Regiment Corporal Giovanni Cracco, who had distinguished himself during the Tunisian campaign and was killed in action on 11 April 1943. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the battalion joined the 31st Armored Brigade \\"Curtatone\\", which in 1986 was renamed Armored Brigade \\"Centauro\\".  101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\"  The 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\" was formed during the 1975 army reform by renaming the II Tank Battalion of the 31st Tank Regiment. The 101st Zappal√† received the war flag and traditions of the 131st Tank Regiment.  Recent times  On 31 July 1993 the 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\" disbanded and its personnel entered the 1st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Cracco\\", which on 1 September 1993 entered the reraised 31st Tank Regiment. On 9 October 1995 the regiment received the war flag and name of the 4th Tank Regiment and transferred its own name and war flag to the 133rd Tank Regiment in Altamura, which was a unit of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". Between 1 January 2011 and 28 February 2017 the regiment was subordinated to the army's Cavalry School in Lecce as test unit for the army's \\"Soldato Del Futuro\\" networked warfighting project. In 2012 the regiment moved from Altamura to Lecce.  Current structure  At its disbanding the 31st Tank Regiment consisted of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Lecce ** Command and Logistic Support Company ** 1st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Cracco\\" *** 1st Tank Company (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 2nd Tank Company (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 3rd Tank Company (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 4th Tank Company (suspended for lack of tanks) The Command and Logistic Support Company fielded the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon. In total the regiment fielded 41x Ariete main battle tanks: 13x per company, plus one for the battalion commander and one for the regiment commander.

The plan was created in partnership primarily between the city of Beira and the Dutch engineering and consultancy firm Witteveen+Bos. This perceived urban renewal is to help mitigate the effects of the increasing ferocity and frequency of environmental phenomena in the region, which has been heavily influenced by climate change. Background Beira is a coastal city that sits at a very low elevation, one that is only slightly above sea level. Due to this fact, as well as Mozambique's vulnerability to climate change, the city is becoming more susceptible to flooding and other water related issues. Furthermore, the city's coastal tide and sea overflow defenses, both natural and artificial, are failing. This has resulted in Coastal erosion, leading to severe flooding, which has numerous impacts on the community, including disruptions in movement and accessibility, economic damages, environmental degradation, and health problems, such as increased cases of Malaria and Cholera. In order to combat these problems, Masterplan Beira 2035 designed a new urban drainage scheme and reinforced coastal defenses. In regards to stormwater and flooding alleviation, Beira plans on building deeper drainage channels, which will flow into a new 150 hectare Retention basin connected to the outer-lying wetlands and ocean. In order to address coastal defenses, the city aims to dredge the harbor, duo remove the increased sediment left by the higher sea level. The recovered sand from the Dredging process will be reused to reinforce natural coast protection areas. The built-up sand and debris has impeded large trade ships from accessing the crucial port, suppressing the city's economic potential. Additionally these projects will also help spur the tourism industry, as the retention basin will also serve as a lagoon while the sand removed will be used in part to create bigger beaches. In addition to these changes in infrastructure, the plan also aims to address current land use issues, especially in areas prone to flooding. Due to the cities population growth over the last couple years, and its future projections, Masterplan Beira 2035 plans on implementing changes to land ownership and development policies, in an attempt to stop settlements, which usually lack basic infrastructure, from being constructed in flood prone areas. This could minimize future relief costs as well as protect people's economic and transportation mobility. There seems to be little opposition to this plan, however, a major setback occurred in March 2019. Cyclone Idai inflicted substantial damage to the city, destroying around 90% of the area. Furthermore, hundreds of people were killed, and thousands were displaced, resulting in additional problems with safe and sustainable housing. Beira plans to utilize the masterplan during and after the relief plan.

It is the fourth film in Pixar's \\"SparkShorts\\" program, and focuses on a son's ability to fly and the choice his father must make. The short was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2019. Plot Dad (portrayed by Bobby Rubio) is playing with his newborn son Alex (portrayed by Eli Fucile) in the front yard of his house. While showing him a dandelion, Alex proceeds to float, surprising Dad. Watchful eyes begin to concern him as he grabs Alex and brings him back inside the house. Now 4-years-old, Alex (portrayed by Luna Watson) continues floating all over the darkened house as Dad has become a hermit with a disheveled appearance. He keeps his son on a leash and stuffs his backpack with rocks to keep him down, although these precautions are later shown to not do much. They leave the house while trying to avoid the neighbors. Dad pauses in front of a playground and watches the other kids play, but he turns to see that Alex has escaped and is interacting with the other children by floating, much to their overall confusion. Dad hurriedly grabs his son, who begins to have a temper tantrum, resulting in Dad asking his son why he can't be normal (the only moment of dialogue in the film). Alex grounds himself and sadly pulls his hood over his head. As he looks at all the park attendees, Dad cradles his son and sits on the swing set. He begins to swing back and forth, reinvigorating his son, and launches him in the air. Alex continues to fly as Dad happily runs around underneath him. Cast * Bobby Rubio as Dad * Eli Fucile as Baby Alex * Luna Watson as Toddler Alex * Mika Kubo as Additional voices Development Float is a short film that was directed and written by Bobby Rubio, and produced by Krissy Cababa and Pixar Animation Studios; it was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the fourth film of Pixar's \\"SparkShorts\\" program, and it lasts approximately seven minutes. In January 2019, Rubio described the program as \\"different films from the kinds of films\\" developed at Pixar, while executive producer Lindsey Collins said that the shorts are referred to as SparkShorts because Pixar \\"[wants] to discover that creative spark\\" in its employees. Rubio viewed the program as \\"a wonderful opportunity to tell [his] story\\". He stated that Float is inspired by his son, who has autism, and that he identified with the father from the short. Rubio said that the boy from the short is \\"different from other children\\" since he can float. He commented that while \\"the father loves his son wholeheartedly without restriction\\" at first, this begins to be altered by what the other people say; as a result, he has to choose between deciding they are right and ignoring their thoughts. Since his son was growing up, Rubio decided he had \\"to tell this story\\" and \\"started storyboarding it\\". The initial storyboards contained Caucasian characters, but one of Rubio's co-workers told him that he should depict Filipino-American characters instead. While he was initially unsure of this idea, he decided to make this change to \\"empower [his son] and empower children of color\\". Rubio wanted to incorporate some of his own features as a Filipino-American into the characters' designs in order to make them look \\"authentic\\". He commented that he was very \\"proud\\" that Float was released during Filipino American History Month. Rubio said that seeing the viewers react to some scenes in the way he had expected them to was \\"amazing\\", stating that he \\"totally loved it\\". According to Rubio, viewers had \\"several different\\" interpretations of the film. Krissy Cababa described Float as \\"a powerful story about being a parent and the struggles you go through as a parent with your kids\\". She also characterized it as \\"an important story about acceptance and being able to love and celebrate the people in our lives\\". Cababa said the short \\"was about celebrating people for who they are and not who you want them to be\\". She stated that \\"people are talking about representation\\" due to Float, \\"sharing what this means to them and its importance\\". She mentioned that the short is \\"a huge deal\\". Cababa said the short had received \\"so much support\\" and a \\"positive feedback\\", saying this had been \\"really overwhelming\\". Music Barney Jones, who composed the music for the Pixar short film Smash and Grab, composed the music for Float. The score was released on February 28, 2020. Track listing Release Float was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2019, alongside fellow \\"SparkShorts\\" entries Purl, Smash and Grab, and Kitbull. Reception Float has obtained a generally positive critical response, with writers deeming it \\"touching\\", \\"moving\\", and \\"spot on\\". The child on whom the short is centered was characterized as \\"extremely cute\\", and as \\"adorable\\". Alex Abad-Santos of Vox described the short as \\"one of the best new things on Disney+\\". He commented that \\"facial expressions and body language carry the story\\" despite the general lack of dialogue, adding that \\"a small shift in posture or the way a frown sharpens an entire face wields so much emotion\\". Abad-Santos stated that the short's \\"core story could be a story about assimilation and growing up as a minority\\" or \\"it could be about what [it is] like to feel different from those around you\\". He said that \\"Float taps into the human instinct to fiercely protect someone you love, the worry that the world out there [will not] see them the way you do, and the hope that that big scary world will love this person as much as you do\\"; he stated that while this \\"sounds like a lot of ground to cover in seven minutes\\", the short manages to do that very well. Fortune's Ellen McGirt said that Rubio's \\"own fear that his son would be judged by others is palpable\\" through this short. Float was described as \\"a film about acceptance\\" with \\"a heartwarming story\\".

Readapted by numerous international groups and in different musical styles, the song is one of the greater known songs in the realm of Peruvian cumbia and cumbia in general.  History  In 1976, √Ångel An√≠bal Rosado founded Los Hijos del Sol. In 1979, he composed Cari√±ito to be adapted by the group led by vocalist Edson Bordaes and accompanied by guitarist Jos√© Luis Carvallo. The song became an immediate success and multiple versions and adaptations began to rise internationally. In 2007, Oliver Conan and Barbes Records, an American music company, presented The Roots of Chicha, a compilation of signature pieces of music derived from the origins of Peruvian tropical music, three of which were by Los Hijos de Sol, one being Cari√±ito. The compilation received massive popularity, leading to widespread recognition of the song as well as Peruvian cumbia. In the 2019 Panamerican Games in Lima, the song was played in the inaugural parade of countries during the entry of the Peruvian delegation, played to symbolize progress in Peru and its diverse cultural identity. The song received positive reception from Peruvians, such so that the President of Peru was seen singing and dancing from the Presidential Pulpit in the Estadio Nacional de Lima.  Other versions  * In Colombia, Rodolfo Aicardi of Los Hispanos recorded another version of Cari√±ito in 1979. Aicardi included guitars and saxophones to accompany the song. One night in 1979 Rodolfo Aicardi came to the recording studios of Discos Fuentes happily and said to Pedro Muriel: ‚ÄúI am successful for this year. I heard it in Ecuador and we are going to record it ‚Äù. In one case, there was a performance by a Peruvian orchestra, \\"Los Ni√±os del Sol.\\" They listened to the two verses that the song has: ‚ÄúI cry for loving you / For loving you and for wanting you / I cry for loving you / For loving you and for wanting you / Ay darling ay my life. Never but never / He abandons me dear / Never but never / He abandons me dear. ‚ÄùThat was all. Nothing else said the lyrics, but had feeling. Immediately Pedro Muriel - the recorder of more than 300 great successes of Discos Fuentes - called the Los Hispanos team. The teacher Luis Carlos Montoya, an experienced arranger for tropical songs, took care of the arrangements. It had already worked with \\"Boquita de Caramelo\\" that had served as a resurgence for Rodolfo and now they would have another great success. They foreshadowed it. Luis Carlos Montoya is a skilled musician. He plays violin, guitar, accordion, bass and the musical notes roll in his mind with agility. Lucho Cruz \\"Condorito\\", Jaime Uribe, the monkey Ospina, Jairo and Guillermo Jim√©nez formed the payroll that \\"Cari√±ito\\" recorded. \\"Rodolfo could not record if Jairo did not play the bass,\\" says Pedro Muriel now. What they sensed became reality. That December the national success was \\"Cari√±ito\\" and the most sensational, the following year he repeated the triumph and not to believe it, in 1981, it was also. In taverns, bars, discos, buses, taxis, \\"I cry for loving you, for loving you and for wanting you\\" was sung. The decade of the eighties gave the subject to be edited in dozens of compilations of Discos Fuentes. In the famous 14 cannon shots they appeared in several editions and it was a compulsory subject in Rodolfo Aicardi's concerts. \\"I had to sing it up to 3 times,\\" says Pedro Muriel now. * In the midst of the 1980s in Chile, the group Pachuco y la Cubanacan included their own version of Cari√±ito. * In the beginning of 2000, Chilean band Chico Trujillo played their version of Cari√±ito, en Berl√≠n y en Chile. This version consolidated its popularity amongst the young populations of Chile. * In 2007, the Ecuadorian group Kien Mat√≥ a Rosero adapted the version using electric guitars in their shows and in 2009 recorded their readapting to the album \\"A lo Rosero\\". * The Peruvian music group Bareto used electric guitar to readapt the Rosado's original version and recorded their version to their album Sodoma y Gamarra (2009). * Los Angeles band La Chamba worked with the original guitarist on the 1979 track, Jos√© Luis Carballo, to record their cover of ‚ÄúCari√±ito\\" https://www.latinousa.org/2018/03/20/lachamba/  References  Category:Spanish-language songs Category:1979 songs ","title":"Cari√±ito"},{"id":"62403771","text":"The 1961 Florida A&M; Rattlers football team was an American football team that represented Florida A&M; University as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) during the 1961 NCAA College Division football season.

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the regiment is assigned to the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\".  History   Formation  The regiment was formed on 15 September 1936 in Verona as 2nd Tank Infantry Regiment with four battalions: IV, V, and XI assault tanks battalions and the III Breach Tanks Battalion. The assault tanks battalions fielded L3/35 tankettes, while the breach tanks battalion fielded Fiat 3000 light tanks. Its structure at its foundation was as follows: * 2nd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Verona ** IV Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Monti\\", in Bolzano (L3/35 tankettes) ** V Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Venezian\\", in Trieste (L3/35 tankettes) ** XI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Gregorutti\\", in Udine (L3/35 tankettes) ** III Breach Tanks Battalion, in Verona (Fiat 3000 light tanks) ** 2nd Tank Training Center, in Verona ** 2nd Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Verona The regiment was renamed 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment on 1 December 1938 and received the IV Breach Tanks Battalion in Vercelli from the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment. On the day of the 32nd regiment's founding, it and the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment entered the II Armored Brigade in Milan, which had been formed on 15 July 1937 with the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment. On 1 February 1939 the brigade was dissolved and the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, 8th Bersaglieri Regiment and newly raised 132nd Armored Artillery Regiment entered the newly raised 132nd Armored Division \\"Ariete\\". On the same date the regiment received the II Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Berardi\\" from the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment. During the same year the regiment also received the CCCXI Breach Tanks Battalion (former I Breach Tanks Battalion) from the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment and the CCCXXIII Breach Tanks Battalion (former V Breach Tanks Battalion) from the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment, while ceding the V Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Venezian\\" to the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment. The regiment then began the process of forming new medium tank battalions with the personnel of the breach tank battalions. In April 1940 battalions were renamed and the regiment entered World War II with the following structure: * 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Verona ** I Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former II Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Berardi\\") ** II Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former IV Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Monti\\") ** III Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former XI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Gregorutti\\") ** I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M11/39 tanks, former III (CCCXXI) Breach Tanks Battalion) ** II Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M11/39 tanks, former IV (CCCXXII) Breach Tanks Battalion) ** III Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M13/40 tanks, former V (CCCXXIII) Breach Tanks Battalion) ** IV Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M13/40 tanks, former I (CCCXI) Breach Tanks Battalion) ** V Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (M13/40 tanks, raised 11 November 1940)  World War II  After Italy's entry into World War II on 10 June 1940 the 32nd regiment ceded some of its units to other regiments: the I and II tank battalions M were ceded on 11 June to the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment for transfer to Libya for the planned invasion of Egypt. The IV Tank Battalion \\"M\\" was ceded to the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment based in Albania to bolster it for the upcoming invasion of Greece, and during fall 1940 the III and V tank battalions \\"M\\" were deployed to Libya, with the III arriving in September and the V arriving in November of 1940. The two battalions fielded 37 M13/40 tanks each and entered the Special Armored Brigade of General Babini. On the day the British offensive Operation Compass began the II Tank Battalion \\"M\\" was destroyed during the British Attack on Nibeiwa. Most tank battalion \\"L\\" were destroyed during the Battle of Bardia, while the I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" was annihilated during the British capture of Tobruk. The III, V, VI, XXI tank battalions M clashed with the 7th British Armoured Division in the action at Mechili. The end for the units of the Italian 10th Army came on 6‚Äì7 February 1941 when their retreat was blocked by the 7th British Armoured Division at Beda Fomm and the furious and futile attempts of the tank battalions to open a breach in the British line during the Battle of Beda Fomm came to naught. With 7 February 1941 the 10th Army with all its units and all the reinforcements sent to it had been destroyed or captured by the British XIII Corps. For its sacrifice the III Tank Battalion M was awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valour, which is nowadays attached to the 32nd Tank Regiment's war flag and displayed on the regiment's coat of arms. The V Tank Battalion M was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour, which is attached to the war flag of the suspended 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\". On 22 January, the day Tobruk fell, the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, together with the entire 132nd Armored Division \\"Ariete\\", embarked in Naples and sailed for Tripoli in Libya where the division arrived on 24 January, the day British spearheads engaged the last Italian units in Cyrenaica. After arriving in Libya the regiment was in no shape to contrast the British advance as it consisted of the I, II, and III tank battalions \\"L\\" with useless L3 tankettes. The first useful M13/40 tanks arrived on 11 March with the VII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" with, which the 32nd regiment's depot in Verona had raised. Followed by the VIII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" formed by the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment, and later on 21 July 1941 by the IX Tank Battalion \\"M\\" formed by the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment. 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment M13/40 tanks in May 1941 The regiment participated in the Erwin Rommel's Operation Sonnenblume and the following Siege of Tobruk. As the regiment's L3/35 tankettes were useless Ariete division commander General Ettore Baldassarre demanded repeatedly to be sent M13/40 tanks to re-equip the regiment's three \\"L\\" battalions or be sent \\"M\\" tank battalions. Ultimately the High Command in Rome settled on a plan to repatriate the men of the 32nd and retrain them at the 32nd's depot in Verona. Therefore the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment raised a new command company, which was transferred to Libya on 1 June 1941 and gave birth to the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment on 1 September 1941 and in October the XIII Tank Battalion \\"M\\", raised by the 32nd regiment's depot in Verona, was transferred to the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment instead of being sent to Africa. After its activation the 132nd regiment received the three \\"M\\" battalions of its sister regiment, whose return to Italy was repeatedly postponed, until both regiments were heavily invested and decimated during the British Operation Crusader, fighting battles at Bir el Gubi on 19 November and 4-7 December and for Point 175 before retreating West. As the Ariete division had lost 76% of its men during Operation Crusader the 32nd regiment was taken out of the front on 31 December 1941 and sent to the rear. On 8 January 1942, the 32nd was disbanded and its personnel used to bring the 132nd regiment partially back up to strength. The war flag of the regiment was then transferred to Verona, where the regiment was activated again in May of the same year. In September 1942 the regimental command and the XVI Tank Battalion \\"M\\" it had raised moved to Sanluri in Sardinia to take command of the armored units on the island. The regiment had now the following structure: * 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Sanluri ** XVI Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (1x company M14/41 tanks and 1x company Semovente 75/18 self-propelled guns) ** XVIII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" (1x company M15/42 tanks and 1x company Semovente 75/18 self-propelled guns, raised by the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment, arrived 27 June 1943) ** CC Tank Battalion \\"S35\\" (captured French SOMUA S35 tanks, raised by the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment, arrived 25 December 1941) ** I Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former XIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Sardegna\\", placed in reserve status and ceded to the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment on 21 March 1944) ** 2x armored car companies On 15 May 1944 the Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" was raised again in Sardinia and the 32nd and 132nd tank infantry regiments joined the division, which remained static on the island. On 2 October 1944, the 32nd regiment was disbanded without having seen combat. The 132nd regiment has already been disbanded on 27 August and the Grantieri division on 31 August.  Cold War  On 1 March 1964 the regiment was reformed in Cordenons as 32nd Tank Regiment and joined the Armored Division \\"Ariete\\". The regiment consisted of the III and V tank battalions, and the XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion. In 1968 the regiment moved to Tauriano.  3rd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Galas\\"  Coat of arms of the 3rd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Galas\\" Coat of arms of the 10th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Bruno\\" During the 1975 army reform the 32nd Tank Regiment was disbanded on 30 September 1975 and its III Tank Battalion became the 3rd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Galas\\", while the V Tank Battalion became the 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\", and its XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion became the 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Castel di Borgo\\". The war flag and traditions of the disbanded regiment were assigned to the 3rd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Galas\\". Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 3rd Tank Battalion's name commemorated 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment Sergeant Bruno Galas, who had fought with the III Tank Battalion in North Africa and was killed in action on 3 January 1941 during the Battle of Bardia. Equipped with M60A1 Patton main battle tanks the battalion joined the Armored Brigade \\"Mameli\\", whose headquarters had been formed from the 32nd Tank Regiment's headquarters. For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms.  5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\"  The 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\" was formed during the 1975 army reform by renaming the V Tank Battalion of the 32nd Tank Regiment. The 5th Chiamenti was granted a new war flag.  Recent times  After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and the \\"Mameli\\" was the first brigade disband. On 1 April 1991, the brigade was deactivated along with some of its subordinate units, while the 3rd and 5th tank battalions, and 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion joined the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\". On 25 August 1992 the 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\" disbanded and its personnel entered the \\"Galas\\" battalion, which entered the reformed 32nd Tank Regiment the next day. From 29 December 1992 to 15 March 1994 the regiment participated with some of its companies in the international Unified Task Force and UNOSOM II missions in Somalia. During this mission on 3 July 1993 the regiment fought in the Battle at Checkpoint Pasta, where for the first time since World War II Italian tanks opened fire at enemy forces. For its conduct and service in Somalia the regiment was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the regiment's war flag and added to the regiment's coat of arms.  Current structure  As of 2019 the 32nd Tank Regiment consists of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Tauriano ** Command and Logistic Support Company ** 3rd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Galas\\" *** 1st Tank Company \\"Leoni di Bardia\\" (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 2nd Tank Company \\"El Mechili\\" (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 3rd Tank Company \\"Beda Fomm\\" (13x Ariete main battle tanks) *** 4th Tank Company \\"Tobruk\\" (13x Ariete main battle tanks) The Command and Logistic Support Company fields the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon. In total the regiment fields 54x Ariete main battle tanks: 13x per company, plus one for the battalion commander and one for the regiment commander.

It is the fifth film in Pixar's \\"SparkShorts\\" program, and focuses on a grandmother and grandson longing to escape an endless chasm. The short was released on Disney+ on December 13, 2019. Plot Ellis (portrayed by Emilio Fuentes) and his Grandmother (portrayed by Sonoko Konishi) live in a mysterious sink-hole full of floating rocks and strange debris of disused items and machines. They manage to make a small home for themselves out of the garbage and feast on potatoes, the only food they are able to grow. Every day, Grandma has Ellis attach a cord to himself to float out and collect items that they can use for their benefit. In particular, the two are building a rocket so that they can escape from the hole and into the bright light at the top. One day, Ellis discovers an abandoned plane in the wreckage, but is downcast when he realizes that it can only sit one person. Grandma offers a plan that he ride the rocket out and simply pull her up with the cord to which he agrees. With the final touches added to their rocket. Ellis gets in and flies upward; avoiding the rocks and debris that he passes by. Despite some turbulence, Ellis makes it out through the top and lands on the outside where he ends up in a lush field and sees birds flying overhead. He then grabs the cord and pulls it up which takes almost the entire day. To his surprise, it's not Grandma at the end of the cord - but a box of potatoes. He hugs the box in tearful gratitude for her sacrifice. Cast * Sonoko Konishi as Grandma * Emilio Fuentes as Ellis Development At Pixar, Edwin Chang started his career as a simulation technical director. After submitting his idea for Wind, he was selected for the program and took a sabbatical from his long-time job, to craft an animated ode to his family history with help from producer Jesus Martinez and a team of animators. In December 2019, Edwin Chang, writer/director of Wind, described the short as \\"The story itself at its core is an immigration story\\". Chang felt that \\"There were all these stories in the news about child immigrants, and while my story wasn't directly related to those, there were a lot of parallels that made those so much more meaningful to us.‚Äù His grandmother and father fled from North to South Korea during the Korean War. His father then immigrated to the United States and had to leave his grandmother behind. Eventually she rejoined them, but the separation left an impression on Chang. His family history served as the main inspiration for Wind, and the current political climate made the themes even more relevant. Music Andrew Jimenez, who composed the music for the Pixar short film Kitbull, composed the music for Wind. The score was released on February 28, 2020. Track listing Release Wind was released on Disney+ on December 13, 2019. Reception Wind has obtained a generally positive critical response, with writers deeming it \\"tearjerking\\" and \\"magical\\". Alex Reif of The Laughing Place described the short as \\"while the ending is a little predictable from the start, it‚Äôs nonetheless a tearjerker.\\" Shireen Honmode of MEAWW felt that the short showed \\"a metaphor of the life of people who struggle to make ends meet\\".

The short was released on Disney+ on January 10, 2020. Plot Renee, a 13-year-old non-verbal girl, sits patiently in a canoe waiting for a partner while playing with a sound app on her phone. Marcus arrives late and is forced by the camp counselor to partner with her, much to his annoyance. Marcus attempts to speak with Renee, who only mutters and makes noises to voice her pleasure or displeasure at something. When Marcus attempts to show off his paddling skills, Renee begins to moan. Marcus asks Renee to tell him what she wants and she responds by showing a poop emoji on her phone and signaling to a couple of outhouses. Marcus obliges and paddles her to land. When they pass by some reeds, Renee seems to completely forget about her bathroom needs and instead wants to have her arms brush through the reeds. She has Marcus paddle through multiple times. When Marcus tries to do the same thing, Renee suddenly goes back to her phone. Marcus paddles them to a sewer tunnel and has Renee play her phone so that the sound can reverberate. She seems to enjoy it at first, but suddenly becomes overwhelmed by the sound and forces them out onto land. She angrily tosses her phone into the lake and hides under the canoe while Marcus watches the chaos unfold in bewilderment. Eventually, Marcus pulls up a reed and sits by the canoe until Renee calms down. She sits up and takes the reed where she begins to giggle and the two repeat the sound that the phone made together. Marcus and Renee get back into the canoe and paddle back to the camp.

The Islander 24 Bahama is a development of the 1961 Islander 24 which itself is a fiberglass development of the wooden- hulled Catalina Islander. Development McGlasson approached Glas Laminates to build a version of his wooden Catalina Islander in fiberglass. The mold was created by using the hull of one of the wooden boats and the resulting fiberglass boats retained the distinctive wooden board imprints from the mold. The 1961 Islander 24 features a trunk cabin, but the raised deck Islander 24 Bahama version proved a bigger commercial success and, as a result the Islander 24 had a relatively short production run. Production The design was built by McGlasson Marine/Islander Yachts in the United States from 1964 to 1970, with 500 boats completed, but it is now out of production. Design The Islander 24 Bahama is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a raised transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast.

The line operates every 30‚Äì33 minutes at all times. Trips are roughly 60-80 minutes long. Current Route Route C8 operates between College Park and White Flint stations from Monday through Saturday with no Sunday service. The C8 operates out of Montgomery division at all times. History Route C8 was known for two different lines, prior to its current line being named under the Aspen Hill-Montgomery Mall Line and Glenmont- College Park Line. Aspen Hill‚ÄìMontgomery Mall Line C8 originally operated as part of the former Aspen Hill‚ÄìMontgomery Mall Line between Aspen Hill, Maryland and Montgomery Mall from February 19, 1978, until 1996. Before operating between Aspen Hill and Montgomery Mall, the route operated from Layhill to Congressional Plaza in Rockville. The route was discontinued in 1996, and was replaced by a combination of several Montgomery County Ride On bus routes. The only route change that the C8 went through between this time period, was in 1985, when C8 was minorly rerouted to serve the newly opened Grosvenor and Twinbrook stations in the middle of its route. Glenmont‚ÄìCollege Park Line Route C8 was then reincarnated on July 25, 1998, to operate as part of WMATA's new Glenmont‚ÄìCollege Park Line. The line was created at the request of the Action Committee for Transit in February, 1998, which sought to enhance transportation between University of Maryland, College Park and Washington Metro stations that are located in the upper northwestern region of Montgomery County, Maryland. The Action Committee for Transit had a very strong ambition for the C8 to operate all the way between College Park‚ÄìUniversity of Maryland station & White Flint station, via Glenmont station between Monday-Saturday. WMATA initially began operating the C8 between College Park and the newly opened Glenmont station during weekday peak-hours only, as an experimental route as WMATA wasn't sure if the new route would be successful in drawing enough riders to be able to sustain the route. The route mostly operated along River Road, Paint Branch Parkway, Campus, Adelphi Road, New Hampshire Avenue, Randolph Road, and Georgia Avenue. If the route succeeded, the line would become permanent and can be extended to White Flint station. 1999 Changes On July 18, 1999, as a result of the success of the route in attracting a high volume of riders, WMATA made the C8 a permanent Metrobus route. WMATA also all all day on weekday and Saturday service, as opposed to operating only during rush hours in order to meet the Action Committee for Transit's request for the C8 to operate more frequently throughout the day and Saturdays. 2001 Changes On January 13, 2001, WMATA finally meet the full request of the Action Committee for Transit, of extending the C8 route beyond Glenmont station, to White Flint station along Randolph Road replacing Ride On route 40. As a result, the name of the route was changed to the College Park-White Flint Line. 2010 Proposed Changes During WMATA's 2011 Fiscal Year, route C8 was proposed to be rerouted to operate to Prince George's Plaza station instead of College Park‚ÄìUniversity of Maryland station to replace route R3. It was also proposed to divert Food and Drug Administration and Federal Research Center in White Oak, Maryland and into Archives II in College Park, Maryland. But route C8 would revert to a weekday peak hour route only discontinuing all midday, weekday evening, and Saturday service. This would lead to a loss of ridership for the C8 since it will only have reduced weekday service instead of Monday through Saturday service. 2012 Changes On June 17, 2012, route C8 was rerouted to divert off the intersection of Adelphi Road and directly enter the National Archives at College Park, replacing route R3. Route C8 also diverted into the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Research Center. Route C8 would skip its diversion into both the National Archives Building and White Oak FDA/FRC building on Saturdays as both buildings were closed. 2016 Proposed Changes In 2016 as part of WMATA's FY2018 budget, it was proposed to eliminate the C8 segment between Glenmont station and White Flint station in order to reduce costs. Performance measures according to WMATA goes as follows: {  - ! Performance Measures !! Route C8 !! WMATA Guideline !! Pass/Fail -  Weekday Daily Riders  2,632  >432  Pass -  Cost Recovery  27.8%  >16.6%  Pass -  Subsidy/Rider  $3.03  <$4.81  Pass -  Riders per Rev Trip  38.6  >10.7  Pass -  Riders per Rev Mile  2.2  >1.3  Pass } * Discontinued segment averages 591 eastbound weekday boardings (19.1 per trip) and 401 westbound weekday boardings (12.5 per trip) according to WMATA automatic passenger counter data, which, accounts for 44.4% of eastbound boardings and 26.6% of westbound boardings. * Discontinued segment averages 354 eastbound Saturday boardings (9.1 per trip) and 248 westbound Saturday boardings (7.8 per trip) according to WMATA automatic passenger counter data, which, accounts for 46.2% of eastbound boardings and 29.7% of westbound boardings. 2017 Changes On July 29, 2017, Saturday service to National Archives at College Park was discontinued due to the National Archives was now closed during Saturdays. Route C8 would skip the diversion on Saturdays but still serve the diversion on weekdays. 2019 Changes Beginning on September 1, 2019 for nine months, the College Park Metrobus loop was temporarily closed for construction of the Purple line at College Park station having all stops located along River Road. As of result, route C8 was temporarily rerouted along River Road having to turn around on the roundabout along Haig Drive to return to its regular route going to White Flint. 2020 Changes Beginning on April 20, 2020, parts of Calvert Road was closed due to the ongoing construction of the Purple line, route C8 was temporarily rerouted along Baltimore Avenue and to turn on Calvert Road to serve the west side of College Park‚ÄìUniversity of Maryland station since vehicles cannot travel along parts of Calvert Road. However the reroute has not operated due to the 2019-20 COVID-19 outbreak and Metro's reduced service since March 16. Route C8 resumed service on August 24, 2020 running the detour along Baltimore Avenue and Calvert Road.

Background A UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout between the current two-time champion Jon Jones and Dominick Reyes served as the headliner. A UFC Women's Flyweight Championship bout between the current champion Valentina Shevchenko and Katlyn Chookagian served as the co-headliner. While not officially announced by the organization, the promotion was initially targeting a light heavyweight bout between former interim title challenger Ovince Saint Preux and Ryan Spann to take place at the event. However, promotion matchmakers elected to go in another direction and the pairing was scrapped from the event. A bantamweight bout between Sean O'Malley and Jos√© Alberto Qui√±√≥nez was originally scheduled to take place at UFC 229. However, it was scrapped after O'Malley failed a United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) drug test. The bout was then expected to take place at this event but it was eventually moved to UFC 248 for unknown reasons. Dhiego Lima was scheduled to face Alex Morono at the event. However, Lima was forced off the card on January 22 with a neck injury. He was replaced by Kalinn Williams. Jimmie Rivera was scheduled to face Marlon Vera at the event. However, Rivera pulled out of the fight on January 23 citing an injury. In turn, promotion officials elected to remove Vera from the card entirely. Antonio Arroyo was expected to face Trevin Giles in a middleweight bout at the event. However, Arroyo pulled out a day before the fight due to medical issues. He was replaced by James Krause, who was already in Houston to corner Youssef Zalal.

Enediynes naturally undergo the Bergman cyclization to produce a 1,4-didehydrobenzene intermediate,Chen, Y.; Yin, M.; Horsman, G. P.; Shen, B. Journal of Natural Products. 2011. 74. 420-424 whose thermal activation energy is stabilized by chelation of the ligand to a metal center, allowing for temperature regulation of this diradical formation.The structure of a generic square planar dication complex with an enediyne ligand motif  Mechanism of reaction  Natural enediyne compounds are found in various bacterial species and function as a radical generator for DNA crosslinking upon cyclization. This reaction is hindered by the high thermal barrier to cyclization in which most of the compounds cannot react below 200¬∞C.Bhattacharya, P.; Basak, A.; Campbell, A.; Alabugin, I. V. Mol. Pharmaceutics. 2018. 15. 768-797 The Bergman cyclization requires the adjacent alkynes of the motif to be forced close enough for radicals to join and form a bond. By chelating an enediyne- containing ligand to a metal center, the alkynes are forced into a geometry that lowers the thermal barrier to cyclization.Bhattacharyya, S.; Zaleski, J. M. Special topics in Medicinal Chemistry, 2004, 4, 1637-1654 An illustration of how chelation closes the inter-alkynyl distance to initiate the Bergman cyclization  Therapeutic capabilities  The diradical formation in the Bergman cyclization provides a potent mechanism for DNA scission and crosslinking by abstracting hydrogens from adjacent ribose sugars, which can then bond to kink or cleave the strand entirely, rendering the DNA of the target cell unusable.Zhang, H.; Li, R.; Ba. S.; Lu, Z.; Pitsinos, E. N.; Li, T.; Nicolaou, K. C. Jour. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019. 141. 7843-7852 Chelation about a transition metal brings the cyclization barrier down to conditions tolerable for the human body; this allows for targeted heating of select tissues to initiate this reaction.

Personal life Piccola is married to Thomas Pristow, Health and Human Services Director for Coconino County, Arizona. Early career Piccola has worked in the child welfare profession for most of her career, and has held positions including Child Protective Services officer in various states and eventually becoming a deputy director for Cuyahoga County's Health and Human Services agency where she was responsible for the county child welfare system. Appointment as DCYF director Following a \\"robust national search and selection process\\", Piccola was chosen by Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo and State Health and Human Services Secretary Elizabeth H.

It means preserving socio-culture such as traditions and enhancing the socio-economic situations of a particular community.Tourism Development in a New Democracy: Residents‚Äô Perception of Community-based Tourism in Mawlamyine, Myanmar Caroline Lusby, Kathy Eow, Journal of Tourism and Recreation, Vol 2, Issue 1 (2015) 23-40 CBT concentrates on economically vulnerable villages and developing countries because CBT is an alternative for economic development as well as conservation and protection of natural resources of those villages. The term CBT was not very scarce until 2012, where the country was free from the political isolation. The country became politically more open, and the nation's doors were open for traveling. Vast foreign investments along with vast tourists, were ready to explore the unknown country. There is a wide range of activities to do, depending on the location of the villages. Some villages offer water activities, and some may not. In the process of implementing CBT villages, non-profit organizations like ActionAid Myanmar also takes part in the process. The ultimate goal of CBT is to generate profits by offering tourists local lifestyles, accommodation, local activities, and culture. Despite its advantages, there are also setbacks while running CBT villages, such as not having adequate both human resources and technical resources. Inle Lake (Southern Shan State)One of the CBT sites in Shan State  History  Myanmar started its political transformation in 2012, after decades of political isolation. Life before 2012 was commute, and there were no connections with the outside world. Doors to other countries were not available much. The majority of people were poor, and the livelihood of the people was substandard. The transition from military dictatorships to a more democratic country led to the implementation of CBT. As a result, tourists became more interested in exploring these pristine and unspoiled sites. Moreover, CBT was included in the 100 Days Plan, the government's reformed agenda. The 100 days was set by the National League of Democracy, accompanied by an optimist view that aimed to work towards the priorities and convenience of the public, such as the development of transport infrastructure, telecommunication, and so on. The tourism Industry became flourished as one of the economic sectors for the sake of generating foreign revenues, protecting local traditions culture, environment, expansion of employment after the country was emancipated from the military regime in 2010.Ling, Barnabas Cung Thawng. \\"Community development through community- based tourism: analyzing operational challenges and opportunities-case study of Sor Long and Taisun CBT Villages in Chin State, Myanmar.\\"  General structure  Even though CBT solely focuses on the community of the host villages, some of the decisions depend on the government's approval or the head of the villages. Most of the villages have heads of the village who would be the medium between the villagers, the professionals, organizations, and the government. Communities must be consulted and involved in the decision-making process on tourism planning and management, which directly affect their livelihoods. However, final decisions shall be made in coordination with the public sector and with the approval of the public administration.Zahkung Tu Mai, 13th June 2017, Another Development East Asia Institute, Community Based Tourism in Myaing and Thandaungyi Assessing Community Participation and Impact of CBT Initiatives on Host Communities Some of the villages are ruled by abbots or monks under the teachings of the monk and the Lord Buddha. CBT prefers the bottom-up decision approach rather than top-bottom decisions where the majority of the votes are determined by the villagers.  Services  CBT villages offer a wide variety of activities and services depending on the location of the villages. Some of the common activities are listed down below. * Bird watching * Visiting religious sites * Fishing * Handicrafts * Trekking * Participating in local festivals Services like bird-watching are common around Ayeyarwaddy Delta and central Myanmar. Since Myanmar is a Buddhist country, apart from villages in upper Myanmar, most of the CBT villages have religious sites to visit such as monasteries, temples, and pagodas where tourists can learn local culture, buy souvenirs, and participate in local festivals. Some of the activities are not common, and only a specific CBT village can offer that service such as AyeYarWaddy Dolphine Sanctuary. Some of the villages are located near the lakes and streams so tourists can also enjoy swimming in them and the villages provide transportations for them. Typically, some youths can speak decent English to communicate back to the tourists because the majority of the villagers are not fluent in English.  Challenges  CBT villages have poor access to adequate basic necessities such as proper sanitation, electricity, infrastructures, finance etc. As a result, the villages have different electricity distribution times. CBT villages do not have infrastructures besides basic housing. Since some of the villages are very commuted, it is very hard to get access to the proper medical treatment. Due to the location being so remote, the connection of the mobile phone or cellular networks is very poor. There is a problem regarding accommodations for tourists. For the accommodation, some of the villages build (B&B;) Bed and Breakfast. In order to build a B&B;, the villages first need to get a B&B; license.Peggy Weidemann 2016 Tourism Involvement in Tourism (CIT) in Myanmar Comparison of Pilot Projects: identification of common challenges Some villages do not even have B&B;, and tourists stay in host families' houses. Some of the families accept boys only and some girls only. For boys, they are allowed to stay in the monastery compound, but for girls, it is inappropriate. Since Myanmar is a developing country, tourism is not flourished yet, and tourists are quite unfamiliar with this country. The political unrest in the country also impacts the image of the country, subsequently affecting tourism. For a startup tourism like CBT, it is harder to get tourists noticed because it is not marketed widely, and there is not sufficient information about CBT villages as well. Deficiency of human capital is also a challenge for CBT villages because some of the youths in those villages emigrated to neighboring countries to get a well-paid job to support back to their families. The majority of the villagers do not have a proper education. Only a few are high school graduates, and college graduates are quite rare. There is only one public school at most, and that school only has till primary school grade (Grade 4 in Myanmar education system). As a result, they do not have a good command of English. It is hard for an ordinary villager to communicate with tourists. That subsequently leads to a lack of understanding of the needs and wants of the tourists.  Goals  The main goal of implementing CBT is that the profits gained from tourism will significantly benefit the livelihood of the community as an additional income besides farming. In this way, CBT can sustain minimally disruptive tourism to the local environment while increasing economic opportunities in a way that is sustainable, community-driven which would benefit the entire community. CBT is working to concentrate more on the voice of the villagers. CBT targets bottom- up decision where the locals have direct decision-making policies. Another goal of CBT's is the poverty reduction. The main source of income becomes from agriculture and the emigrants sending money back to their families. CBT goal is to provide an alternative or additional way of income for the reduction of poverty. One of the statements made by the National League of Democracy is to welcome visitors who are keen to promote the welfare of the ordinary people and the conservation of the environment and to acquire an insight into the cultural, political, and social life of the country while enjoying a happy and a fulfilling holiday in Myanmar. The majority of the tourist destination sites are located in Mandalay, Bagan, and Yangon. CBT villagers want to minimize the number of tourists in the concentrated area; instead, they want to generate job opportunities and income for the indigenous people in the rural areas. Since CBT villages lack both capitals and human resources, it is one of the goals is to build local capacities such as training for workshops, communication skills, and knowledge.  Local and tourists' perspectives  When it comes to CBT tourism, there are two sides: the local and the tourist. The perspectives of the locals are different depending on their assumptions of CBT. The locals of the CBT villages think that tourists mostly come because of nature, and sometimes because of the sun. The tourists want to feel the sunlight despite the scorching heat because the sun is rare to see in certain parts of the world. Some locals are very trilled to serve those tourists not because of money because years ago, they do not have any chance to interact with tourists directly and there were not many tourists after all. On the other hand, some locals assert that what tourists bring is trash, and these tourists are exploiting their resources. There is one problem with CBT villages. Before these villages became CBT, they were just poor villages. As a result, youths from those villages started to emigrant to neighboring countries, mostly Thailand and Malaysia. Those emigrants thought that they could support their families only if they work outside of the country. When CBT was implemented, this kind of problem was partially solved because CBT will contribute to those families' income. From the tourist's perspective, despite the lack of infrastructure and sanitation, they still enjoy coming to CBT villages. Some tourists have difficulties in finding information about tourism and the CBT villages because they cannot find much information on the internet. Tourists state that they can bring some culture back to their countries. At the same time, Myanmar people, especially from the poor background, can also get an idea of the outside world about how the world is rapidly changing, how other people are doing, and how kind of people there are out in the world.  Locations in Myanmar  CBT villages can be found in every corner of Myanmar, offering different kinds of activities based on the location of a particular village. These are some of the lists of CBT villages in Myanmar. {  + !States and Division !Villages - Kahin State Lone Tone Village Haipu Village Nant Mee Laung He Village Nyaung Pyinat Village - Kayah State Pan Pet Village Tanilarle Village one Kayaw ethnic Village Hta Nee La Lah Village Pan Pet Kayah Village Daw Ta Ma Gyi Village Htay Kho Village Demwaso in Kayah Statehood - Kayin State Thandaungyi Chin State Sorlong village Ta Suan village Rakhine State Jetetaw Fishing Village Kyeintali Village - Shan State Lwe Kaw Village Inne Village Hteenae Village Kakku Village Pin Sein Pin Village Sikyaa Inn Village Lwenwe Phaya Taung Yay Seit Village Samkar Village Ywar Ngan Village Lwal Pann Sone Village Pa O self Administration Zone in Shan State - Yangon Division Twante (Kalatharpura) Kyaikthalae Village -  Mandalay Division Sithe Village MyitKanGyi Village YwarThit Village Myay Sun Village Sein Pan Gone Village Aye Kyun Village HsinKyun Village Sin Taung Ayeyarwaddy Dolphine Sanctuary - Magway Division East Kantawgyi Village West Kantawgyi Village SuLePan Village InYaung Village Magyikan Village Htan Pin Kone Village Khun Khaly Village - Sagaing Division Nwe Nyeing Village Zalon Taung - Thanintharyi Division San Hlan Makyonegalet Village Donnyaungmhine Village }  References  Category:Tourism in Myanmar ","title":"Community Based Tourism in Myanmar"},{"id":"62404506","text":"The John Lee Webber House, also known as \\"The Webber Place\\", in Yountville, California, was built around 1859. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is a two-story wood frame farmhouse which was built before 1859. It was built in simplified, vernacular Greek Revival style. The house was originally built as a one-and-a-half-story clapboarded farmhouse, with a gable roof and a central brick chimney, and was located on the Finnell Ranch, almost a mile east of its current location in downtown Yountville. It had a one-story rear addition which served as a kitchen. The house was moved to the current location in the 1860s. The house was expanded in 1907-08 by the Webber family, at which time it was given its current appearance. The front entrance of the farmhouse, in the non-gable facade now facing southeast, remained as the main entrance in 1980. With The 1907-08 renovation added the gabled second-story room cantilevered over the front porch, with large window facing southeast. It also added/expanded to the northwest (apparently, while \\"north\\" is stated), forming a wing making an \\"L\\" with the original house. This included an indoor bathroom beyond the kitchen, and then an enclosed back porch. It had a shingle-sided second story with bedrooms having tongue-and-groove panelling. The first floor of the renovated house had wall-papered rooms, and consisted of kitchen, dining room, and front and back parlors. In 1980, doublehung sash windows survived in the original house and in the rear extension, while some second-story windows had been replaced by vertical casement windows. A second contributing building is a shiplap-sided gabled two-story carriage house/barn (photo #4), opening onto Webber Avenue, which was built in 1905. It held two horses, a cow, a buggy, and a surrey. It had sliding frame double-doors, and a rectangular door and square windows above in the gable end. As of 1980 the barn was unaltered, and was used for storage. In 2019, the carriage house still exists, although it appears to have been renovated/modified. Since 1980, the property has become the Lavender Bed and Breakfast, and additional buildings have been constructed in the former yard-spaces.This is now the \\"Lavender Bed and Breakfast\\". Oddly, the B&B;'s webpage has no photos distinctively showing the house or carriage barn. It is hard to read street number on the house in Streetview, but a nearby house, across the street, has number 2011. And Google maps points to this house for 2020. Photo and Streetview seem to show house in NRHP photos. Satellite view shows three additional oblong buildings have been inserted into former yard-space in the property. These presumably provide additional guestroom spaces, and are connected by walkways to the original house and the renovated coach house. The property is located at 2020 Webber Ave. in Yountville, on the north corner of Webber Ave. and Jefferson St. Apparently there has been a street renumbering; the National Register documentation states it is located at 6610 Webber Ave. Notes References External links *Lavender Bed and Breakfast, official website Category:National Register of Historic Places in Napa County, California Category:Greek Revival architecture in California Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1859 ","title":"John Lee Webber House"},{"id":"62404507","text":"Li Ruxin (; born October 1969) is a Chinese physicist and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

Biography  Claire Pommet grew up in the Lyon area. She learned music theory from the age of 6, joined a children's choir, La Cigale de Lyon, at age 7, and learned to play the cello at age 8. Her mother plays the flute while her father, a real estate agent, listened to Michel Polnareff, Serge Reggiani, and Charles Aznavour. A friend's father introduced her to American folk and country music. She is self-taught and publishes videos on the YouTube web platform. In September 2017, at the age of 21, she performed for the first time at La Boule Noire in Paris. In October she released her first chanson fran√ßaise album, titled √Ä peu pr√®s; it was described as a mixture of pop and folk by Salome Rouzerol-Douglas in Le Figaro. It was \\"very encouraging\\" according to Gilles Renault in Lib√©ration, while Marie-Catherine Mardi of RFI said that \\"the lyrics do not convince [in their entirety]\\" but praised Pommet's voice. The journalists of Lib√©ration and Le Figaro emphasize the quality of her live performances, during which she particularly plays the automatic harp and the guitar. Pomme performed in the first part of the Asaf Avidan tour in autumn 2017. In February 2018, she performed at the Caf√© de la Danse in Paris, after having performed as an opening act for Louane and Vianney, then took the stage in La Cigale in mid-2018 and in La Trianon in early 2019. The lyrics she writes often evoke themes of love, death, and \\"everyday situations that resort to romanticism\\". Love, in her lyrics, is not only heterosexual, but also bisexual or homosexual; she dedicates a song to Quebec singer Safia Nolin, who used to be her partner. She explained to T√©l√©rama: \\"I am naturally comfortable with my homosexuality, for example, using female pronouns in my songs. And I think it's important, given the amount of thank you messages I get. As a teenager, I would have also liked to recognize myself in lesbian singers\\". In 2020, she won the Victoires de la Musique award for album r√©v√©lation (\\"newcomer album\\") of the year with her second studio album Les failles.

The construction method is essential for civil engineers; utilizing it appropriately can help to achieve the desired results. The term building refers to the creation of physical structures such as buildings, bridges or railways. One of the four types of buildings is residential and building methods are easiest to study in these structures.  Background  Construction involves the creation of physical structures such as buildings, bridges or railways. Bricks are small rectangular blocks that can be used to form parts of buildings, typically walls. Before 7,000 BC, bricks were formed from hand-molded mud and dried by the sun. During the Industrial Revolution, mass-produced bricks became a common alternative to stone. Stone was typically more expensive, less predictable and more difficult to handle. Bricks remain in common use. They are small and easy to handle, strong in compression, durable and low maintenance. They can be formed into complex shapes, providing ample opportunity for the construction of aesthetic designs. The four basic types of structure are residential, institutional and commercial, industrial, and infrastructure/heavy.  Residential  Residential buildings go through five main stages, including foundations, formwork, scaffolding, concrete work and reinforcement.  Foundation  Foundations provide support for structures, transferring their load to layers of soil or rock that have sufficient bearing capacity and suitable settlement characteristics to support them. There are four types of foundation depending on the bearing capacity. Civil engineers will often determine what type of foundation is suitable for the respective bearing capacity. The foundation construction method depends on considerations such as: * The nature of the load requiring support * Ground conditions * The presence of water * Space availability * Accessibility * Sensitivity to noise and vibration  Shallow foundation  Shallow foundation Shallow foundations are used where the loads forced by a structure are low relative to the bearing capacity of the surface soils. Deep foundations are needed where the bearing capacity of the surface soils is insufficient. Those loads need to be transferred to deeper layers with higher bearing capacity.  Raft or mat foundation  Raft foundations are slabs that cover a wide area, often the entire building footprint. They are suitable where ground conditions are too poor to create individual strip or pad foundations for a large number of individual loads. Raft foundations may combine beams to add support for specific loads.  Pile foundation  Pile foundations are rectangular or circular pads used to support loads such as columns.  Strip foundation  Strip foundations provide a continuous line of support to a linear structure such as a wall. Trench fill foundations are a variation of strip foundations. The trench excavation is almost completely filled with concrete. Rubble trench foundations are a further variation of trench fill foundations and are a traditional construction method that uses loose stone or rubble to minimise the use of concrete and improve drainage.  Formwork  Formwork is used for the process of creating a mold into which concrete is poured and solidified. Traditional formwork is fabricated using wood, but it can employ steel, glass fibre, reinforced plastics and other materials. Formwork for beams takes the form of a box that is supported and propped in the correct position and level. The removal time for the formwork will vary with air temperature, humidity and consequent curing rate. Typical striking times are as follows (using air temperature of 7-16 ¬∞C): Form work * Beam sides: 9‚Äì12 hours. * Beam soffits: 8‚Äì14 days. * Beam props: 15‚Äì21 days. This consists of a vertical mold of the desired shape and size matching the column to be poured. To keep the material thickness to a minimum, horizontal steel or timber clamps (or yokes) are used for batch filling and at varying centers for filling that is completed in one pour. The head of the column can provide support for the beam formwork. Even though this gives good top lateral restraint, it can make the formwork complex. The column can be cast to the underside of the beams. A collar of formwork can be held around the cast column to complete the casting and support the incoming beam. False work  Falsework  Falsework consists of temporary structures used to support a permanent structure. Falsework need to have accurate calculation.  Bar bending  Rebar Rebar is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used in reinforced concrete and masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. The surface of rebar is often patterned to improve the quality of the bond with the concrete. Rebar is necessary to add tensile strength, while concrete is strong in compression. It can support tensile loads and increase overall strength by casting rebar into concrete.  Concrete  construction site workers loading water, sand, ballast and cement into a concrete mixer Concrete is typically used in commercial buildings and civil engineering projects, for its strength and durability. Concrete is a mix of cement and water plus an aggregate such as sand or stone. Its compression strength means it can support heavy weights. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) cam be used for home construction. They are made by pouring concrete between rigid panels, often made out of polystyrene foam. Rebar can provide additional strength internally, and the exterior panels can remain in place once the concrete sets. It is essential to check the levels of foundation before pouring.  Brick  Brick work Bricks are laid with a mortar joint bonding them. The profile of the mortar can be varied depending on exposure or to create a specific visual effect. The most common profiles are flush (rag joint), bucket handle, weather struck, weather struck and cut and recessed. The bonding pattern describes the alignment of the bricks. Many standard bond patterns have been defined, including stretcher bond. Each stretcher (brick laid lengthwise) is offset by half a brick relative to the courses above and below of English bond. Stretchers and headers are laid with alternating courses aligned to one another. American common bond is similar to the English bond but with one course of headers for every six stretcher courses. English cross bond has courses of stretchers and headers, but with the alternating stretcher courses offset by half a brick. Flemish bond consists of alternating stretchers and headers in each course. Header bond has courses of headers offset by half a brick. Stack bond consists of bricks laid directly on top of one another with joints aligned. This is a weak bond and is likely to require reinforcement. Garden wall bond has three courses of stretchers then one course of headers. Sussex bond has three stretchers and one header in each course.

In addition to her literary works, she is known as the mother of Helena Blavatsky, founder of Theosophy. Early life and family She was born Yelena Andreyevna Fadeyeva to a noble family in Rzhyshchiv. Her parents were Andrei Fadeyev, privy councilor and governor of Saratov, and Princess Yelena Pavlovna Dolgorukaya, a member of the princely House of Dolgorukov. Also among her relatives were the poet Evdokia Rostopchina and Yekaterina Sushkova, a friend of Lermontov, with whom Yelena was also personally acquainted. She was also related to the famous poets Ivan Dolgorukov and Fyodor Tyuchev. At the age of sixteen, she married Captain Pyotr Alekseyevich Hahn (Peter Hahn von Rottenstern; 1798-1873), a military man almost twice her age, descended from an old Baltic German family. They would have three children, including future writers Helena Blavatsky (born 1831) and Vera Zhelikhovskaya (born 1835). Literary activity In 1835 she made a partial translation of the Bulwer- Lytton novel Godolphin, which was published in Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya, then edited by her literary mentor Osip Senkovsky. In 1837 her first novel, The Ideal, was serialized under the pseudonym Zeneida R-va. While traveling in the Caucasus in 1837 she met exiled Decembrists, an experience which would inform a number of subsequent works, including Memoirs of Zheleznovodsk and Utballa and Jellaleddin, published in 1838. In the following three years she published further stories: Medallion, Court of Light, Theophania Abbiaggio. In 1842 she authored Idle Gift, published in Otechestvennye Zapiski. Her collected works were published in St. Petersburg in 1843, and republished in 1905. Hahn's literary merits did not go unnoticed by her contemporaries. Many prominent literary figures responded to her works. Ivan Turgenev wrote, \\"In this woman there was ... both a warm Russian heart and the experience of female life, as well as the passion of conviction.\\" Vissarion Belinsky wrote, \\"There are writers who live a separate life from their creations, and there are writers whose personality is closely related to their works. Reading the first, you enjoy the divine art without thinking about the artist; reading the second, you enjoy the contemplation of a beautiful human being, think about her, love her, and want to know the details of her life. Our gifted Zeneida R-va (Yelena Hahn) belongs to this second category.\\" References Category:1814 births Category:1842 deaths Category:Helena Blavatsky Category:Russian women writers ","title":"Yelena Hahn"},{"id":"62404675","text":"Gemse Peak, is a granitic horn located in the North Cascades of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It is situated west-northwest of Coquihalla Summit, west of Alpaca Peak, and northeast of Steinbok Peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Anderson River. The mountain was named for the gemse, the chamois of Germany, as part of the ungulate names theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of the 1974 first ascent party. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Gemse Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Gemse Peak.

Humans were suffered a lot from that incident. They decided to send birds to heaven for mercy. Birds were performed Manaw dance and sang for Nat, spirits. They were pleasured by their performance and they let them dance Manaw dance on earth. Later, men have emulated the dance from birds and started dance Manaw dance to worship Nat, spirits. Manaw ( Manau ) was called after the proverb \\" Masaw Nau Ningsan Jau\\". 'Masaw Ningsan' means heaven and above. 'Nau', 'Jau', 'Jaw' men give and worship. Manau means worship to God or heaven.

Career  In the late 1970s, Bray began purchasing carousel animals to restore with funds she had inherited and invested. Her first purchase was a figure from the Kiddieland Carousel at the Pomona Fair. A major restoration effort was undertaken when, after 14 years of working on it, Bray purchased the Santa's Village Carousel. Bray founded her studio in the early 1980s. She has amassed carousel figures of all kinds since, from serpents, zebras, tigers, camels, and roosters to dragons, witches, lions, peacocks, goats, and cats. Her oldest hand-carved animal is a tiger from 1875. Her holdings include pieces from the Knott's Berry Farm Lagoon Carousel; the estate of Swen Swenson, America's first collector of carousel pieces; the only known zebra carved by famous carousel carver Charles Carmel, and other curiosities.

He is described as a coxswain of King Sanphet VIII's royal barge in the Ayutthaya period who was famous for honesty and integrity. Phan Thai Norasing served his duty as the coxswain until around 1704 that the accident was happened during King Sanphet VIII's fishing trip causing damage to the boat. From this, he willingly accepted the consequence according to Thai ancient monarch law which is execution. Although, he was given a pardon not to be headed. From his heroic decision, he became the historical figure and is worshipped by a later generation. Therefore, there are many legacies dedicated to him such as his shrines which they are presumed to be his execution spots, renovated canal, and a monument, etc. Also, a story of Phan Thai Norasing has been conveyed through various forms of entertainment including films, TV series, and musicals. Even though plots of them might be altered or extended but the core of the story regarding honesty will still be presented to be an example for progeny.  Life  Even though it cannot be fully confirmed whether he actually existed or not. But based on few available historic records, the original name of Phan Thai Norasing is \\"Sing\\" (Thai:‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏´‡πå) and his birthplace is assumed to be Bhan Bha Mhok, Ang Thong in current time. Also, he had a wife named \\"Sri Naun\\". For \\"Phan Thai\\", it is a title for coxswain in Thai and how Sing earned this title started from the first meeting between Sing and King Sanphet VIII (Phrachao Suea) during King Sanphet VIII's trip in Ang Thong. During the trip, he disguised as a civilian and met Sing through boxing match. After that, Sing was called by King Sanphet VIII and became coxswain or \\"Phan Thai\\" in Thai and became very close after that.  Death  Statues in Phan Thai Norasing historical park presenting the scene when Pha Thai Norasing convinced King Sanphet VIII to order the execution for him According to historical records, the execution of Phan Thai Norasing occurred 1704 at Khok Kham Canal, Sakornburi (Samut Sakorn in the present time). The name of Phrachao Suea's royal barge that Phan Tha Norasing steering is Ekkachai. Khok Kham canal before restoration was very twisted so, it was very hazardous to travel through. However, Phan Thai Norasing chose this path accidentally or some historians suggest that he wanted to protect King Sanphet VIII from assassins. Eventually, the royal barge was accidentally hit with a large tree and the figurehead of the royal barge was damaged and fallen off. The consequence of guilty coxswain is beheading based on ancient monarch law. Sing was initially given a special pardon from King Sanphet VIII because he thought it was just an accident but Sing denied. King Sanphet then ordered the crew to create a clay statue represented Sing and beheaded it instead. However, Sing still insisted so King Sanphet VIII had no choice but ordering him to be executed.  Legacy  Because of his life story, he is worshipped and respected by later generation as well as becoming a model of honesty. From this, many shrines and statues were built to dedicate his heroic action. Locations of shrines are based on presumed execution points which are around Khok kham canal.  Phan Thai Norasing's shrine  This shrine is located at the mouth of Khok Kham canal, Phanthai Norasing, Muang Samut Sakorn, Samut Sakorn. It is believed to be the oldest original point of Phan Thai Norasing's execution. For the shrine, it was an eyes-level height shrine that contained the head of Phan Thai Norasing and the figurehead of the Ekkachai barge together. As time goes by, the original shrine was scoured and destroyed by water. In 1950, however, the new shrine was constructed by His Royal Highness Prince Panuphun Yukhon from filming a movie in the same year. The new shrine is also eyes-level height and has 6 legs. Additionally, there is a statue of Phan Thai Norasing which is made up of sandalwood.

There is an abundance of exotic plants, such as Arenga Pinnata. The plants expand wildly in the cordon of stalagmites and stalactites. During the visits, rare animals like elongated tortoises and pink dragon millipede might be found. The valley is located in Kao Huai Sok, one of the mountains in a limestone mountain range, comprising an area of about 48,000 square meters. A long time ago, this was an enormous cave until the ceiling collapsed. Major limestone blocks scattered on the floor of the valley confirm this theory. Surrounding by limestone mountains, the sunlight is restrained from reaching the ground during any time than midday. The place was discovered by a local monk in 1979. Later in 1984, the mountain has been blasted to make convenient access to the valley.  History  The cave was discovered in 1979 by Suntitumgosol, a local monk at Tham Thong Temple. At that time, he climbed down the cliff and found that there are many Arenga Pinnata grow in that area. Which the Arenga Pinnata is categorized as an ancient tree in the same family as palm trees. He has dug off and blasted an opening in 1984. In the same year, this place has become a conservation area to develop it in the future as an ecotourism place. The Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation recognized the uniqueness and importance of the valley and took place under its custody to make it well preserved.  Geography and climate  Arenga Pinnata Hup Pa Tat is located in the area of Tham Pratun Non-hunting area, Lan Sak district, Uthai Thani city. This area is a limestone mountain range that exists outstandingly surrounded by flat area and agricultural area of the inhabitants. This limestone mountain range consists of 5 limestone mountains which are Kao Pla Ra, Kao Kaung Chai, Kao Noi, Kao Nam Chon, and Kao Huai Sok. Part of the limestone mountain range surrounding the valley is Khao Huai Sok, which is connected to Khao Plara mountain, 1 kilometer away. The surrounding limestone mountain is layered with high cliffs that restrict sunlight from reaching the ground during any time other than midday. These limestone mountains in this area are limestone in the Permian era, which is 245-286 million years. This limestone mountain had been rained on for years, got dissolve by the rain that has a mild acid. The mild acid rain flowed in between the crack inside Huai Sok Mountain until it became a vast cave hole inside the mountain; the process takes about ten to a hundred thousand. This cave is a closed cave inside the mountain which humans cannot enter. While on top of the mountain range, is a forest fulled of plants in ancient times. Until there is an unexpected change in the earth's crust that made the ceiling of the cave collapsed. It became a large pit inside the Huai Sok Mountain which the high of the edge is approximately 150 ‚Äì 200 meters.  Ecology  Pink dragon millipede (Desmoxytes purpurosea) The resulting humidity has contributed to a wealth of flora, featuring large shrubs of the genus Excoecaria that are similar to ancient trees. The department of National Park stated this area as a conservation area dual to its geography with many exotic plants such as Caryota urens, Croton oblongifolius Roxb., Oxyceros horridus, balanophoraceae. Walking along the 700 meters path, animal footprints like deer, bears, boars, or tigers claw marks on the trees can be seen. Elongated tortoises and pink dragon millipede can be found in this area. The Pink dragon millipedes can be seen during the rainy season, around August - November. The pink dragon millipede has a bright pink color, looks like the pollen of the flower. It has an outstanding character with a pattern and button that similar to a dragon. It can be found in a forest with high humidity and abundance.

The tournament initially started out as a non-title tournament in 2015, but was upgraded to major title status in May 2017. The current Ei≈ç title holder is Takuya Nagase. The Ei≈ç title match is different from the other seven major title matches in that it allows the two participating players the select the time control for each game from a list of three options. In addition, all of the tournament games are broadcast live on Dwango's online video platform Niconico. Format The tournament is open to all active professional shogi players, one women's professional shogi player and one amateur shogi player. It is divided into four parts: women professional and amateur participation determination tournaments, a preliminary tournament, a main tournament and a title match. All of the games are broadcast live on Dwango's online video platform Niconico. Women professionals and amateur participants Separate one-day single-elimination tournaments are held prior to the beginning of the preliminary tournament to determine the woman and amateur participants. Four participants are selected by the sponsors for each tournament: the women's tournament participants are selected from the reigning women professional major title holders and the amateur tournament participants are selected from the reigning . Each tournament has two rounds with a primary time control of one hour per player using a chess clock system followed by a secondary byo-yomi time control of sixty seconds per move. The tournament pairings are determined by drawing lots, with one of the first round games played in the morning and the other played in the afternoon. The two winners then play each other in the evening to determine which player will advance to the preliminary tournament. Preliminary tournament The preliminary tournament is single-elimination tournament divided into different blocks according to player rank, with all players ranked the same competing against each other; the women's professional and amateur player are placed in the block for player's ranked 4-dan. Each block follows a bracket tournament format with a total of sixteen players advancing to the main tournament. The number of brackets per block varies with the winner of each bracket advancing to the main tournament as follows: four players from the 9-dan block; three players each from the 8-dan, 7-dan and 6-dan blocks; two players from the 5-dan block; and one player from the 4-dan block. The primary time control for the preliminary tournament games is one hour per player using a chess clock system followed by a secondary byo-yomi time control of sixty seconds per move. The preliminary tournament games are typically played between mid-June and the end of October. Main tournament The main tournament is a single elimination tournament which consists of the sixteen players advancing from the preliminary tournament plus an additional eight players seeded into the main tournament for a total of twenty-four players. The seeded players are determined among the following: (1) the four semifinalists from the previous year's tournament; (2) major title holders (excluding the reigning Ei≈ç title holder); (3) winners of major non-title shogi tournaments; and (4) players who performed exceptionally well in the previous years tournament per consultation with the tournament sponsors. The main tournament pairings are determined by drawing lots and players who win their games advance up through the bracket. The remaining two players from each half of the bracket advance to a best-of-three challenger match, and the winner advances to main title match. The primary time control for the main tournament and challenger match games is three hours per player using a chess clock system followed by a secondary byo-yomi time control of sixty seconds per move. The main tournament games are played between November and January, with the challenger match taking place in February. Title match The main title match between the reigning Ei≈ç and the challenger is a best-of-seven series with the first player to win four games becoming the Ei≈ç title holder. The title match takes place from April to June, and it is the only one of the best-of-seven major title matches not to follow a two-day-per- game format. It is also the only major title match in which the games are played at varying primary time controls, with the starting time for each game determined based upon the time control selected. A furigoma or \\"piece toss\\" takes place at a pre-tournament publicity event held some weeks before the start of the match to announce the match venues, schedule and other details. The winner of the furigoma moves first in the first game and then the players alternate for the remaining games. The primary time control for each game is then determined by the players at the same event, with the player scheduled to move first in game one selecting one of the following time controls for the first two games: one hour per player, three hours per player or five hours per player. The player who moves second in game three selects one of the two remaining time control options for games three and four, and the time control for games five and six will be the last remaining option. The time control of the seventh and final game of the match will be six hours per player. Regardless of the time control selected for each game, there will also be a secondary byo-yomi time control of sixty seconds per move. History Shogi Den≈çsen series In 2011, Dwango entered into an agreement with the JSA to co-sponsor a series of unofficial games and matches between professional shogi players and top computer shogi programs called the Shogi Den≈çsen. The 1st Den≈çsen took place in 2012 between retired shogi professional Kunio Yonenaga and the program , the reigning World Computer Shogi Champion, with the computer winning fairly easily. The 2nd Shogi Den≈çsen in 2013, 3rd Shogi Den≈çsen in 2014 and Shogi Den≈çsen Final in 2015 each featured a team of five shogi professionals playing against five computer shogi programs. All of the Sh≈çgi Den≈çsen games were broadcast on Niconico, with the final game of the 3rd Shogi Den≈çsen being watched by more than 600,000 people. Ei≈ç and Den≈ç Tournaments established After the Shogi Den≈çsen Final finished, Dwango and the JSA announced that there would be no more five-on-five Shogi Den≈çsen matches, but rather two new tournaments would be sponsored by Dwangothe Ei≈ç Tournament for the professionals and the Den≈ç Tournament for the computerswith the winners of each then playing a two-game match held at a later date called the Den≈çsen. The name \\"Ei≈ç\\" was selected based upon the results of an online poll of Niconico users conducted by Dwango. The kanji \\"Âè°\\" means \\"clever\\" or \\"smart\\", while the kanji \\"Áéã\\" is means \\"king\\" or \\"ruler\\", i.e. a leader of humans; so, the winner of the Ei≈ç would wise and clever and represent humans against the representative \\"king\\" of the computers. Entry into the Ei≈ç Tournament was optional and left to the decision of each player. After the announcement that the 1st Ei≈ç was going to take place, 154 shogi professionals expressed their desire to participate; five shogi professionalsincluding major title holders Yoshiharu Habu and Akira Watanabestated, however, that they would not. The 1st Ei≈ç Tournament was won by Takayuki Yamasaki in December 2015; he then faced the Den≈ç Tournament winner in AprilMay 2016, but lost both games. The number of professionals participating in the 2nd Ei≈ç Tournament was 158 (defending champion Yamazaki was seeded into the main tournament), but four, including Watanabe once again, decided to opt out. The tournament was won by Amahiko Sat≈ç, the then Meijin title holder, in December 2016; he then went on to face Ponanza, who repeated as Den≈ç Tournament winner, in AprilMay 2017, but lost both games. End of Den≈çsen matches and upgrade to major title status In February 2017, Dwango and the JSA announced the 2nd Den≈çsen match would be the last to be held since the games between professionals and computers had fulfilled their intended purpose. After the 2nd Denosen match, Dwango announced that had reached an agreement with the JSA to upgrade the Ei≈ç Tournament to major-title status and replace the two-game match against the Den≈ç Tournament winner with a best-of-seven match between the reigning Ei≈ç title holder and the winner of a challenger tournament. Since there would be no reigning title holder at the start of the 3rd Ei≈ç Tournament in 2017, the two finalists of the challenger tournament would play a best-of-seven match to determine the winner of the Ei≈ç title. The upgrade in status of the Ei≈ç Tournament made it the first new major title match in 34 years and the first to be sponsored by an IT company; in addition, the total prize fund for the tournament was also such that it made it the third highest among major title tournaments after only the Ry≈´≈ç and Meijin. The first winner of the Ei≈ç title was Taichi Takami in May 2018.

Route D6 was split to operate between Sibley Hospital & the Stadium‚ÄìArmory station, via Washington Union Station, instead of operating to Washington Hospital Center in order to replace the segment of the former routes 40, 42, and 44 between Union Station and Stadium‚ÄìArmory station when both 40 and 44 were discontinued and 42 was shortened to operate between Mount Pleasant and Metro Center station. Route D8 was also split to only operate between Washington Hospital Center Washington Union Station. The segment of D8's routing west of Union Station was replaced by routes D1, D3, and D6. At the same time, the D8 replaced the segment of D6's former routing between Union Station and Washington Hospital Center, via Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station. As a result, as route D6 became a part of the Sibley Hospital‚ÄìStadium Armory Line, which operated alongside routes D1 and D3 while route D8 became a part of the Hospital Center Line. 2014 Proposed Changes In 2014, WMATA proposed to shorten the D8 to Rhode Island Avenue station and to have a new Route D7 to operate between Rhode Island Avenue and the hospital campus in order to Improve reliability of service by operating shorter routes, Reduce the number of buses operating on the congested hospital roadways, and Create a better balance of capacity and demand throughout the line.

Released a year later, Reflections of a Golden Dream tips the scales a bit closer to funk ... After this Reflections starts to seem as meditative as its title, achieving a kind of elegant spiritual suspension while also feeling as fleet and slick as satin ... and while the rest of the record contains many period accouterments -- sustained strings, electric pianos, deep echoes -- the essence of the record is indeed meditative. Perhaps these are polyester paisley dreams but that doesn't make them any less real or affecting\\".

It was originally scheduled to take place on 31 May 2020, but it was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic in Italy.Elezioni Regionali, il 31 Maggio si vota in Toscana, Veneto, Campania, Puglia, Liguria e Marche Electoral system The Regional Council of Campania () is composed of 50 members, elected in a party-list proportional representation system. The seats are divided among five constituencies corresponding to the region's provinces: Avellino with 4 seats, Benevento with 2 seats, Caserta with 8 seats, Naples with 27 seats, and Salerno with 9 seats. Regional councillors are selected from party lists at the constituency level, with an electoral threshold at 3%. An additional seat is reserved to the President-elect, who is the candidate winning a plurality of votes. A majority bonus of 60% is granted to the winning coalition. Background In February 2020, the direction of the Democratic Party (PD) officially confirmed that the centre-left candidate for President of Campania would be the incumbent President Vincenzo De Luca. The centre-right coalition picked former President Stefano Caldoro, a member of Forza Italia (FI), as its candidate, after hypotheses of a Northern League candidate or Mara Carfagna (FI) were abandoned. The Five Star Movement (M5S) discarded the idea of a coalition with the centre-left, and proposed its own candidate Valeria Ciarambino. Previously, the M5S had proposed the incumbent Minister of Environment Sergio Costa as its candidate.

It is contrasted with conventional \\"hard\\" climate change denial, which refers to explicit disavowal of the consensus on global warming's existence, causes, or effects (including its effects on human society). Soft denial is akin to cognitive dissonance: despite understanding and accepting the scientific consensus on climate change as substantially true, a person in \\"soft\\" climate denial may behave as though the existence or severity of global warming are not fully real. A person in soft denial about global warming may neglect its urgency, miscalculate its risks, overestimate the extent of scientific uncertainty, and underestimate the extent of social change required to effectively mitigate climate change. Additionally, one may prefer inaction, postponement of climate action, or maintaining the status quo to an unreasonable degree, or may simply fail to act on the issue whatsoever due to apathy or disengagement. Even some forms of unproductive activism could be considered soft denial. More generally, soft climate denial can refer to any mild or partial climate change denial. Michael Hoexter is credited with formalizing the definition of soft climate denial in September 2016, though the term was in use earlier. The closely related term \\"neoskepticism\\" originated a month earlier in Science Magazine. While soft climate denial generally connotes a state of mind or set of beliefs, neoskepticism describes a deliberate set of rhetorical strategies adopted by opponents of climate mitigation policy. Although neoskeptics do not deny the existence of global warming outright, they err toward the most optimistic, least disruptive projections and oppose mitigation policy as ineffective, costly, or both. Both soft climate denial and neoskepticism are relevant to the politics of global warming, the political (not scientific) global warming controversy, and the study of environmental communication. The term soft climate denial has been used to criticize political inaction on climate- related issues. Development of the terms Expanding the meaning of \\"denial\\" The idea of \\"soft\\" or implicit climate change denial became prominent in the mid-2010s, but variations of the same concept originated earlier. An article published by National Center for Science Education referred to \\"implicit\\" denial: In May 2015, environmentalist Bill McKibben penned an op-ed criticizing Barack Obama's policies of approving petroleum exploration in the Arctic, expanding coal mining, and remaining indecisive on the Keystone XL pipeline. McKibben wrote: McKibben's use of the word \\"denial\\" was an early expansion of the term's meaning in environmental discourse to include \\"denial of the significance or logical consequences of a fact or problem; in this case, what advocates see as the necessary policies that flow from the dangers of global warming.\\" In April 2016, the environmentalist organization Friends of the Earth Action accused Hillary Clinton‚Äîwho was, at the time, campaigning in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries‚Äîof \\"engaging in soft climate denial.\\"; . \\"Luke warmism\\" In 2012, Clive Hamilton published an essay 'Climate change and the soothing message of luke- warmism'. He defined luke warmists as \\"those who appear to accept the body of climate science but interpret it in a way that is least threatening: emphasising uncertainties, playing down dangers, and advocating a slow and cautious response. They are politically conservative and anxious about the threat to the social structure posed by the implications of climate science. Their ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù approach is therefore alluring to political leaders looking for a justification for policy minimalism.\\" He associated Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute, but also Roger A. Pielke Jr., Daniel Sarewitz, Steve Rayner, Mike Hulme and \\"the pre-eminent luke- warmist\\" Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg. Michael Hoexter's analysis of soft climate change denial Michael Hoexter, a scholar and sustainability advocate, analyzed the phenomenon of \\"soft climate change denial\\" in a September 2016 article for the blog New Economic Perspectives and expanded on the idea in a follow-up article published the next month. (the original article); (the follow-up). Despite the term's earlier, informal usage, Hoexter has been credited with formally defining the concept. (crediting Hoexter as the originator of the concept). In Hoexter's terms, \\"soft\\" climate denial \\"means that one acknowledges in some parts of one's life that climate change is real, disastrous and happening now but in most other parts of one's life, one ignores that anthropogenic global warming is, in fact, a real existential emergency and catastrophic.\\" According to Hoexter, \\"soft climate denial and the thin gruel of climate action policies that accompany it may be functioning as a 'face-saving' device to mask fundamental inertia or a deep manifest preference for inaction while continuing fossil-fueled business as usual.\\"; partially quoted in . Hoexter used the term to critique the inadequacy of mainstream political responses to global warming: He also applied the term to \\"more 'radical' groups\\" that pushed for more responsive measures, but \\"often either miss the mark in terms of the climate challenge facing us or wrap themselves in communication strategies and 'memes' that limit their potential influence on politics and policy.\\" In Hoexter's view, soft denial can only be escaped through collective action, not individual action or realization. Neoskepticism \\"Neoskepticism\\" was coined in a policy paper published in the August 2016 issue of the journal Science.; ; . The term has substantial overlap with \\"soft climate change denial\\". Written by Paul Stern of the National Research Council and three other authors, the article makes the case that opposition to climate policy was beginning to take a \\"rhetorical shift away from outright skepticism\\": rather than denying the existence of global warming, neoskeptics instead \\"question the magnitude of the risks and assert that reducing them has more costs than benefits.\\" According to the authors, the emergence of neoskepticism \\"heightens the need for science to inform decision making under uncertainty and to improve communication and education.\\" There are a range of projected changes that will result from global warming and a variety of possible mitigation policies. Disagreement over the sufficiency, viability, or desirability of a given policy is not necessarily neoskepticism. However, neoskepticism is marked by failure to appreciate the increased risks associated with delayed action. Distinguishing \\"rational optimism\\" from neoskepticism, Gavin Schmidt described the latter as a form of confirmation bias and the tendency of \\"always taking as gospel the lowest estimate of a plausible range.\\" Neoskeptics err toward the least-disruptive projections and least-active policies and, as such, neglect or misapprehend the full spectrum of risks associated with global warming. They also neglect the costs associated with delay and inaction. Factors that contribute to soft climate denial In his second article on the topic, Hoexter listed several beliefs or thought patterns that, in his observation, tend to contribute to soft climate denial: #Psychological isolation and compartmentalization ‚Äì Events of everyday life usually lack an obvious connection to global warming. As such, people compartmentalize their awareness of global warming as abstract knowledge without taking any practical action. Hoexter identifies isolation/compartmentalization as the most common facet of soft denial. #\\"Climate providentialism\\" ‚Äì In post-industrial society, modern comforts and disconnection from nature lead to an assumption that the climate \\"will provide\\" for humans, regardless of drastic changes. Though named for a belief found in some forms of Christianity, Hoexter uses the term in a secular context and relates it to anthropocentrism. #\\"Carbon gradualism\\" ‚Äì An assumption that global warming can be addressed though minor \\"tweaks\\" conducted over extended periods of time. Proposals for more drastic change may be more realistic, but appear \\"radical\\" by comparison. #Substitutionism ‚Äì A tendency among politically engaged people to \\"substitute a high-minded pre- existing activist cause\\" in place of the more immediate challenge of fossil fuel phase-out. Hoexter associates substitutionism with eco-socialism, green anarchism, and the climate justice movement, which he said tends to prioritize \\"laudable and important concerns about environmental justice and inequality\\" at the expense of \\"the future-looking fight to stabilize the climate.\\" #Intellectualization ‚Äì Engaging with climate change in a primarily academic context makes the issue an abstraction, lacking the visceral stimuli that prompt people to take concrete action. #Localism ‚Äì Emphasis on \\"small\\" changes to improve one's local environment is a well-intentioned but limited response to a problem on the scale of global warming. #\\"Moral or intellectual narcissism\\" ‚Äì Deriving a misplaced sense of superiority over \\"hard\\" climate deniers, soft deniers may come to believe that simply acknowledging the existence of climate change or expressing concern is sufficient by itself. #\\"Confirmation of pre-existing worldview\\" ‚Äì Because of cognitive inertia, people may fail to integrate the significance or scale of climate change the framework of their existing beliefs, knowledge, and priorities. #Millenarianism ‚Äì Activists become transfixed with a grand vision of an eventual, fundamental transformation of society, supplanting meaningful concrete action at the day-to-day level. #Sectarianism ‚Äì Activists may become preoccupied with a particular vision of climate policy and become caught up in the narcissism of small differences, tedious debates, and far-flung hypotheticals to the detriment of more productive activity. #\\"Commitment to Hedonism\\" ‚Äì The looming dread of climate change can emotionally overwhelm a person and may prompt a retreat into pleasure for its own sake. Alternately, people may indulge in pleasurable activities that they worry may not be readily accessible in a future society adapted to climate change. #\\"Entente with nihilism, defeatism, and depression\\" ‚Äì In Hoexter's view, genuine nihilism remains a tendency within \\"hard\\" denialism; however, people who feel disempowered or overwhelmed about climate change may come to accept an uneasy coexistence with such nihilism. According to Anne Pasek, the difficulty of comprehending the sheer scale of global warming and its effects can result in sincere (albeit ill-founded) belief that individual changes in behavior will suffice to address the problem without requiring more fundamental structural changes. In political terms, soft climate denial can stem from concerns about the economics and economic impacts of climate change, particularly the concern that strong measures to combat global warming or mitigate its impacts will seriously inhibit economic growth. Usage in political discourse Soft climate denial has been ascribed to both liberals and conservatives, as well as proponents of market-based environmental policy instruments. It has also been used in self-criticism against tendencies toward complacency and inaction. Depending on perspective, sources may differ on whether a person engages in \\"soft\\" or \\"hard\\" denial (or neither). For example, the environmental policy of the Trump administration has been described as both \\"soft\\" and \\"hard\\" climate denial.Sources describing Trump as a \\"hard\\" denialist: * Sources describing Trump or administration officials as \\"soft\\" denialists: * (\\"On the first round of Sunday shows since President Donald Trump announced the United States' withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, two members of his cabinet [Scott Pruitt and Nikki Haley] defended the move by promulgating a form of soft climate denialism.\\") Rupert Read critiqued soft denial as a widespread condition of modern culture and a potentially more damaging phenomenon than open \\"hard\\" denial: In Scientific American, Robert N. Proctor and Steve Lyons criticized Bret Stephens, a conservative New York Times opinion columnist and self-described \\"climate agnostic\\", as a soft denialist. According to Proctor and Lyons: Writing for the Post Carbon Institute, Ashik Siddique argued that all the other current opinion columnists at the Times expressed varying degrees of soft denial in their work. He analyzed the writing of Stephens's fellow conservatives (Ross Douthat and David Brooks) as well as his liberal colleagues (Maureen Dowd, David Leonhardt, Frank Bruni, Gail Collins, Charles Blow, Paul Krugman, Nicholas Kristof, Thomas Friedman, and Roger Cohen). In his view, these writers had failed to thoughtfully consider their own newspaper's reporting on the issue and were \\"about as irrelevant to actual policy discussions about our rapidly worsening crisis as Stephens.\\" Criticism Critics have argued that labels like soft denial are overly broad and counterproductive. Brian Schatz, a US Senator from Hawaii who has focused on climate change as an issue, said that the term \\"denial\\" should be reserved for those who dispute the reality, human causation, and urgency of climate change. According to Schatz, expanding the definition further would mean \\"throwing around the term without any precision\\" at a time when \\"actual climate denial is on the wane.\\" Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental research center affiliated with ecomodernism, said the label \\"denier\\" can be unhelpful and alienating regardless of its intended target, but is especially polarizing when used to label someone who accepts the scientific consensus and expresses support for environmentalist ideas.

The Medical Council of Hong Kong requires that these non-locally graduated doctors display the LMCHK qualification as a post- nominal title first, before listing any other quotable qualifications, such as MD or MBBS. The LMCHK are represented by the Licentiate Society, an independent, non-profit organization.  History  Prior to the 1997 handover, graduates of non-Commonwealth jurisdictions had to obtain the LMCHK medical license before being eligible to practice medicine in Hong Kong. During this Colonial era, doctors of Commonwealth countries were automatically granted registration by the MCHK without taking an examination or undergoing a internship or other period of assessment. A few hundred of the Colonial doctors remain in practice in Hong Kong today. Since 1997, all non-locally trained doctors have to obtain the LMCHK medical license from the MCHK. Consequently, the countries of origin of the LMCHK doctors have changed dramatically in the last 20 years; the group is now much more diverse.  Aims  A key facet of the attaining the LMCHK is passing the Hong Kong Medical Licensing Examination (HKMLE). According to the Medical Registration Ordinance, the purpose of passing the HKMLE shows the achievement of a standard acceptable for registration as a medical practitioner in Hong Kong.  Process  The process involves assessment of the doctors‚Äô medical education and professional knowledge, and have been found to be consistent with the high standards established and demanded by the Medical Council of Hong Kong. To be awarded the LMCHK designation, the doctors must pass the rigorous HKMLE and undergo a period of assessment. To start the process of attaining LMCHK from the Medical Council of Hong Kong, doctors must apply after having fulfilled at least 5 years of non-local medical training, including having graduated from an accredited medical school outside of Hong Kong and completed an internship in a hospital. Once attained, the LMCHK designation allows holders of the qualification to register as medical practitioners in Hong Kong. LMCHK doctors must thus be both licensed and registered to practice medicine in Hong Kong. In contrast, graduates of HKU and CUHK are eligible to directly register as medical practitioners in Hong Kong after internship by virtue of their local medical school degree without having to first seek a medical license.  Society  The rigorous requirements for LMCHK doctors and their increasing numbers has fostered a camaraderie among them. In 2017, the LMCHK doctors founded a non-profit, professional association called The Medical Licentiate Society of Hong Kong (Licentiate Society) to represent them and to meet their group's professional needs.

The oak tree stood atop a set of steps known as the \\"Fish Stones\\" that were used by medieval monks to display salmon for sale. The tree declined during the 20th century and was reinforced with a metal support; an acorn from the tree was planted in 2007 to grow a replacement. The original Caton Oak fell on 20 June 2016.  History  The Caton is reputed to have been the focus of the village since the era of the druids, for whom the oak was a sacred tree which often formed the centre of religious rites. For this reason the tree is also known as the Druid's Oak. There was activity in the village during Roman times, as evidenced by a millstone found nearby. The Caton Oak is rooted in the River Lune and the trunk protrudes above a set of old sandstone steps known as the \\"Fish Stones\\". In Medieval times monks from Cockersand Abbey used the steps to display for sale salmon that had been caught in the river. The tree can be seen to be in good health in a photograph of 1905. By the 1940s the tree was the site for a portable blacksmith's forge where a smith from nearby Hornby regularly set up to shoe horses for Caton's agricultural community. The tree became a local landmark and a symbol of the village, featuring in the logos of the village school and its sports club. A sign affixed to railings around the tree states that it has been listed as a historic site by the Department of National Heritage. A Caton-with-Littledale parish councillor said in 1996 that \\"the tree is the most important landmark in Caton and we should try to preserve it as long as there is any life in it at all\\". The village of Caton lies within the Forest of Bowland area of outstanding natural beauty.  Death and replacement  The tree declined during the later 20th century and was said to have become dangerous by 1996. Specialists were consulted who recommended that the tree be felled but it was saved by the villagers and the parish council who erected metal props to the branch in question. The improvements were carried out in 1998 under the Parish and Community Environment Scheme funded by Lancashire County Council, Caton- with-Littledale Parish Council, Rural Action and public contributions.Plaque affixed to railings at the site (see for example photograph here By 2007 the trunk, which measured in circumference, was hollow through decay. On 27 April 2007 an acorn from the tree was planted within the hollow by the High Sheriff of Lancashire (Ruthe Winterbottom) so that a replacement tree could grow. The new tree would have killed the old tree as it grows within it. The original Caton oak fell on 20 June 2016.

As a teenager, he had a hard time since he and his stepmother did not get along. Then one day, he found an illustrated poem by the high school girl named Ryu Hyang in his room, which impressed him, and he became determined to become a writer. Since then, he began to study Korean national literature and popular literature and worked at an industrial complex in Daegu.

He mostly writes simple and easy poems, but they are very moving especially because he restrains from exhibiting his emotions too overtly. Some of his poems depict his longing for the sister who died young of cancer and for those who are gone now, while others talk about the pains of the contemporary people.\\"Abe saenggak Book Description,\\" Kyobo Book Center, accessed November 22, 2019, http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb;=KOR&linkClass;=&barcode;=9788992219143.

With such compassion he ultimately pursues love, which is 'the desire to communicate,' by sublimating the pains of the contemporary people into humor and jokes.

Major works  The characters who appear often in his poetry are poor, but they conform to their reality without any resistance and are sacrificed: for example, \\"Silnae pojang ajumma (Ïã§ÎÇ¥Ìè¨Ïû• ÏïÑÏ§åÎßà, Lady at the Cart Bar),\\" in which the lady tells the story of her life as it is, and \\"Napddeul gomo (ÎÇ©Îú∞ Í≥†Î™®, Aunt in Napddeul)\\" as well as \\"Dwoeji abi (ÎèºÏßÄ ÏïÑÎπÑ, Pig Father)\\" that show fatalism. Many of his poems are set in his hometown, Andong, like the poetry collection Andong soju.Hong Ki-don, \\"On Ahn Sanghak's Oraedoen yeopseo: Maitreya Looks Where the Sun Goes Down,\\" The Back Allies of the Artificial Utopia (Seoul: Silcheon Munhaksa, 2006), 141‚Äì156.

Abae saenggak, his forth poetry collection, mostly deals with sympathy and longing. In the poem \\"Hansik (ÌïúÏãù, Korean Meal),\\" the jokes thrown by farmers when they are tired from planting rice represent the virtue of caring and respecting the living things, which lets the readers know how people of the countryside live as a harmonious community.

The diameter of this space of colorings is four: it takes four steps to get from either of the top two colorings to the bottom one. In the mathematics of graph coloring, Cereceda‚Äôs conjecture is an unsolved problem on the distance between pairs of colorings of sparse graphs. It states that, for two different colorings of a graph of degeneracy , both using at most colors, it should be possible to reconfigure one coloring into the other by changing the color of one vertex at a time, using a number of steps that is quadratic in the size of the graph. The conjecture is named after Luis Cereceda, who formulated it in his 2007 doctoral dissertation. Background The degeneracy of an undirected graph is the smallest number such that every non-empty subgraph of has at least one vertex of degree at most . If one repeatedly removes a minimum-degree vertex from until no vertices are left, then the largest of the degrees of the vertices at the time of their removal will be exactly , and this method of repeated removal can be used to compute the degeneracy of any graph in linear time. Greedy coloring the vertices in the reverse of this removal ordering will automatically produce a coloring with at most colors, and for some graphs (such as complete graphs and odd-length cycle graphs) this number of colors is optimal. For colorings with colors, it may not be possible to move from one coloring to another by changing the color of one vertex at a time. In particular, it is never possible to move between 2-colorings of a forest (the graphs of degeneracy 1) or between -colorings of a complete graph in this way; their colorings are said to be frozen.See , remark following Proposition 2.6, p. 26. Cycle graphs of length other than four also have disconnected families of -colorings., p. 37. However, with one additional color, using colorings with colors, all pairs of colorings can be connected to each other by sequences of moves of this type. It follows from this that an appropriately designed random walk on the space of -colorings, using moves of this type, is mixing. This means that the random walk will eventually converge to the discrete uniform distribution on these colorings as its steady state, in which all colorings have equal probability of being chosen. More precisely, the random walk proceeds by repeatedly choosing a uniformly random vertex and choosing uniformly at random among all the available colors for that vertex, including the color it already had; this process is called the Glauber dynamics. Statement The fact that the Glauber dynamics converges to the uniform distribution on -colorings naturally raises the question of how quickly it converges. That is, what is the mixing time? A lower bound on the mixing time is the diameter of the space of colorings, the maximum (over pairs of colorings) of the number of steps needed to change one coloring of the pair into the other. If the diameter is exponentially large in the number of vertices in the graph, then the Glauber dynamics on colorings is certainly not rapidly mixing. On the other hand, when the diameter is bounded by a polynomial function of , this suggests that the mixing time might also be polynomial. In his 2007 doctoral dissertation, Cereceda investigated this problem, and found that (even for connected components of the space of colors) the diameter can be exponential for -colorings of -degenerate graphs. On the other hand, he proved that the diameter of the color space is at most quadratic (or, in big O notation, ) for colorings that use at least colors. He wrote that \\"it remains to determine\\" whether the diameter is polynomial for numbers of colors between these two extremes, or whether it is \\"perhaps even quadratic\\". Although Cereceda asked this question for a range of colors and did not phrase it as a conjecture, by 2018 a form of this question became known as Cereceda's conjecture. This unproven hypothesis is the most optimistic possibility among the questions posed by Cereceda: that for graphs with degeneracy at most , and for -colorings of these graphs, the diameter of the space of colorings is . If true, this would be best possible, as the space of 3-colorings of a path graph has quadratic diameter. Partial and related results Although Cereceda's conjecture itself remains open even for degeneracy , it is known that for any fixed value of the diameter of the space of -colorings is polynomial (with a different polynomial for different values of ). More precisely, the diameter is . When the number of colorings is at least , the diameter is quadratic. A related question concerns the possibility that, for numbers of colors greater than , the diameter of the space of colorings might decrease from quadratic to linear. suggest that this might be true whenever the number of colors is at least . The Glauber dynamics is not the only way to change colorings of graphs into each other. Alternatives include the Kempe dynamics in which one repeatedly finds and swaps the colors of Kempe chains, and the \\"heat bath\\" dynamics in which one chooses pairs of adjacent vertices and a valid recoloring of that pair. Both of these kinds of moves include the Glauber one-vertex moves as a special case, as changing the color of one vertex is the same as swapping the colors on a Kempe chain that only includes that one vertex. These moves may have stronger mixing properties and lower diameter of the space of colorings. For instance, both the Kempe dynamics and the heat bath dynamics mix rapidly on 3-colorings of cycle graphs, whereas the Glauber dynamics is not even connected when the length of the cycle is not four.

Life  Pius Reher was born in Bl√∂nried near Weingarten into modest circumstances. His parents were Martin Reher and Anna Lang. He took his vows on 10 August 1614. He studied in Ingolstadt and from 1621 in Dillingen, where he ultimately received the title of magister. He was already subdeacon at the time and became deacon on 10 April 1621. He became priest on 24 September 1622. He was acting as subprior, instructor fratrum, and eventually as novice master. His election as abbot took place in the presence of the nuncio on 15 April 1630. Pope Urban VIII confirmed him on 16 December 1630. The Nuncio Ranuccio Scotti gave him the blessing on 3 May 1631 in Einsiedeln. He was abbot during the Thirty Years' War.  Works   Thirty Years' War  During the Thirty Years' War, tensions arose on the borders of the princely Abbey. Abbot Pius was confronted with requests for the permission of marching through his territories. He granted the requests to Henri, Duke of Rohan and in the same year to the imperial people as well. He subsequently formed a military alliance with Philip IV of Spain.  Successes  Pius Reher consolidated the Abbey's rights in treaties with the citizens of Wil, St. Gallen and Appenzell. He settled questions of tithes and other issues with the city of Wil in several treaties from 1650‚Äì1654. Between 1652 and 1654, the bodies of various catacomb saints were transferred to the Abbey in solemn processions. Pius chose the income of the parishes of Grub and Goldach to finance the acquisitions of the Abbey library. He expanded the curriculum of the Gymnasium of Rorschach ‚Äì founded by his predecessor, Abbot Bernhard ‚Äì by introducing courses on philosophy and theology. The Abbey printing works, which had been active since 1635, were translocated from St. Johann to Saint Gall. These expenditures led him to amass considerable debt. His successor, Abbot Gallus Alt, was then faced with the task of dealing with that debt.  Reform Efforts  Thanks to his strong reform efforts he was appointed protector of the monasteries of Salem and Kempten. His religious zeal is beyond doubt, as is his reform ethos. Nonetheless, he was well familiar with the doctor and mayor of the city of St. Gallen, Sebastian Schobinger.

He was the DA's Shadow MEC for Community Safety. Early life John Clifford Moodey was born on 22 November 1958 in Doornfontein, a suburb of Johannesburg. He and his family were later evicted and forced to move due to the Group Areas Act. He became an activist while he was still in school. Political career Moodey was previously a trade unionist and served on the executive of the Combined Employers Union. He joined the Democratic Party in 1998, which became the Democratic Alliance in 2000. He was elected to the Johannesburg City Council in 2000 as the ward councillor for Florida. He became chairperson of the DA caucus in 2001 and soon deputy chairperson of the party in Gauteng South in 2002. He became Provincial Chairperson of the DA in 2004. In the same year, he was appointed a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. He was elected Provincial Leader of the party in 2007, succeeding Ian Davidson to become the party's first black leader in Gauteng. At the DA's October 2009 provincial conference, in a bid to secure re-election, Moodey's campaign sent out SMS's displaying false information. The provincial conference was nullified and disciplinary steps were taken against Moodey. A second provincial conference was promptly called for and held in April 2010, in which former DA MP Janet Semple defeated Moodey by just 8 votes. In January 2012, Semple announced her retirement as the provincial leader. Moodey declared his intention to contest the position at the party's conference in March. He was endorsed by Semple and DA Federal Youth Leader Makashule Gana. Moodey defeated MP Ian Ollis. In November 2014, Moodey was re-elected for another term after he defeated MPL Refiloe Nt'sekhe. He secured another term in November 2017 after he defeated Ghaleb Cachalia. In February 2020, Moodey announced that he would be retiring as provincial leader ahead of the party's upcoming provincial conference to be held later on in the year. On 24 February 2020, he announced that he would run for DA Federal Leader at the party's Federal Congress, which was scheduled to be held in May. The elective conference was postponed to October 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak and Moodey temporarily suspended all campaign activities. On 2 September 2020, Moodey resigned from the Democratic Alliance, citing race and an internal disciplinary proceeding. He joined Herman Mashaba's ActionSA in October.

On 8 September 1628, Jakob Alt took his vows in the benedictine Abbey of Saint Gall and was given the monastic name Gallus. He was ordained priest on 16 February 1636. He studied law with Placidus Bridler in Ingolstadt (1639/40) and Rome (1640/42) and graduated with the title of Doctor iuris canonici (doctor of Canonical Law). In Saint Gall, he started to climb the Abbey's administrative hierarchy. In 1645 he was made governor of monastic properties in Ebingen, he became subprior of Saint Gall in 1647, and prior and governor of Neu St. Johann in 1650. In 1652 Gallus was made deacon and thus proxy to his Abbot Pius Reher. After Pius' death on 9 September 1654, Gallus was elected next abbot on 17 December of the same year. He was the second bearer of that name after Saint Gall, the founder of the monastery. He was confirmed in 1655 by Pope Alexander VII, the benediction followed on 7 May 1656. He was very intent on keeping a strict discipline within the abbey and even succeeded in increasing the number of conventuals from 45 to 70 on average.

They are situated on the western side of the park that surrounds the Pena Palace, and are part of the Sintra Cultural Landscape, classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site since 1995. They are also part of the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park. History The Chalet was built between 1864 and 1869 for King Fernando II (1816-85), King-Consort to Queen Maria II until her death in 1853, and his future second wife, Elise, Countess of Edla (1836-1929), who was a Swiss-born, American-naturalized opera singer. The relationship between Fernando and Elise is considered to be one of the great love stories of Portuguese history. It caused considerable scandal because they wanted to marry, although she was a commoner who had, moreover, a young daughter with an unknown father. The couple finally managed to marry in 1869 when Fernando persuaded his cousin, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, to create a title for Elise, enabling her to become Countess of Edla. Fernando and Elise The couple planned the chalet to be in the style of a typical Swiss Chalet, that was much in vogue throughout Europe at the time. They constructed the building as they went along, without plans, with the assistance of a local builder known as Greg√≥rio. This lack of plans would subsequently cause problems for the restorers at the beginning of the 20th century. The fern garden close to the Chalet The chalet was surrounded by a garden, with mature trees, lakes and flowering bushes. It now forms part of the park surrounding the Pena Palace. Among the 200 botanical species are camellias, rhododendrons, azaleas and a large collection of ferns from Australia and New Zealand. Trees were introduced from North America, with the assistance of John Slade, an American forester who was Elise‚Äôs brother-in-law. Fernando left the Pena Palace, park and gardens to the Countess in his will. However, the Portuguese State bought the property from her, believing it to be too important to be in the hands of a foreigner and the second wife of the deceased king. With some of the proceeds the Countess continued to give scholarships to the pianist and composer Jos√© Vianna da Motta and to Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro an artist and cartoonist. She also supported the Sintra branch of the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia, a charity first set up in 1545. The Countess would visit the Chalet for four months a year until 1910. She died in 1929 in Lisbon. The restored dining room with cork-inlaid walls Restoration Following the purchase by the government the chalet gradually went into decline. Following a fire in 1999 that partially destroyed it, reconstruction, supported by EEA and Norway Grants, was undertaken from 2007 in order to return the building to its original state. The building and garden were reopened to the public in 2011. In 2012 the restoration project received a Portuguese Tourism Award, as well as the Gr√©mio Liter√°rio Award. In 2013 it was also awarded the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage in the ‚ÄúConservation‚Äù category. The Chalet now looks just as it did at the time it was built. It is a brick construction covered in plaster and painted to resemble wooden planks. The windows, balconies, handrails, are decorated with cork. Inside, the restoration team went to considerable lengths, with very little information to go on, to identify the use of the various rooms and to reconstitute the decorative elements painted on the walls.

It was raised by the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante (IPP) in Florence, but never patented owing to its limited aesthetic appeal. It was introduced to the UK in 2011 by the late Dr David Herling, Resistant Elms, who trialled it successfully at Wingham in Kent.Herling, D. (2014). Resistant Elms. It was later trialled by Hampshire & Isle of Wight Branch, Butterfly Conservation, as part of an assessment of DED-resistant cultivars as potential hosts of the endangered White-letter Hairstreak.Brookes, A. H. (2020). Disease-resistant elm cultivars. Butterfly Conservation, Lulworth, England. 'Wingham' was released for sale in the UK in 2019. Thomson, T. H. (2019). 'Disease resistant elm'. Gardeners' World Dec. 2019. Immediate Media Co., London. Description Branching is typically rather irregular and unbalanced, but the foliage strongly resembles that of its ancestor, U. √ó hollandica ‚ÄòVegeta‚Äô, better known as the Huntingdon Elm, the colour ranging from mid-green to a dark malachite. Pests and diseases Tested by inoculation with the pathogen, 'Wingham' displayed an extraordinary resistance ('5 out of 5') to Dutch Elm Disease, exhibiting defoliation of just 1.44%, with 0% dieback, one of the highest of all the 1000+ clones raised by IPP, Italy.Santini, A., Pecori, F., Pepori, A., & Brookes, A. (2011). 'Morfeo' Elm: a new variety resistant to Dutch elm disease. Forest Pathology, April 2012, Vol. 42, Issue 2, 171-176 Cultivation 'Wingham' has excelled in the UK where planted on fertile alluvium in river valleys, but has struggled on poorer chalk and clay soils, emulating the 'English' Elm U. minor 'Atinia'. At the Castellaccio trials site in Italy, specimens increased in height by up to 1.94 m per annum, with a commensurate increase in girth of 2.84 cm. The clone is not known elsewhere beyond Italy in continental Europe, and has not been introduced to North America or Australasia.

It is located at the corner of 8th St. and 4th Ave. in Kinder. Architecture: Vernacular Commercial It \\"is a single story brick commercial vernacular structure located on Eighth Street in the small town of Kinder. There have been some alterations over the years, but the building's architectural identity survives well intact. / Laid up in common bond brick, the building features two shopfronts, one of which has a corner entrance. Originally, it contained two separate stores. The original metal fixed awning is surmounted by a transom level (windows covered over) and a paneled parapet. The parapet top culminates in a central pediment shape and is surmounted by three concrete pineapple finials. The shopfronts retain their original shape and configuration, although the glass and kickplates are replacements. An interesting feature of the shopfront level is that the piers are coated with concrete which is lightly scored to resemble cut stone. The rear and north side of the building feature segmentally arched openings, most of which have been bricked in, although the outlines are clearly visible. The south side of the building is a party wall which formerly divided it from an adjacent commercial building. This adjacent building was recently demolished. To prevent moisture penetration at the top of the former party wall, the present owner applied a strip of standing seam metal sheathing (about 3 feet in height). The interior is modern looking, with plywood paneling and a lowered acoustical tile ceiling. The original pressed metal ceiling is still in place above the acoustical tiles. In addition, the old beaded board walls appear to be still intact beneath the plywood paneling. The only other noteworthy interior alteration has been the removal of the brick wall which previously divided the two shops.\\" With References LA Category:National Register of Historic Places in Allen Parish, Louisiana Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1916 ","title":"Genius Brothers Building"},{"id":"62406129","text":"The first Gotabaya Rajapaksa cabinet was a central government of Sri Lanka led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

It demonstrates the importance of riparian areas as an interface for exchanges between running water ecosystems and neighbouring terrestrial ecosystems, leading to a better understanding of the dynamics of riparian vegetation cover, the decomposition of their litter and their role in recycling carbon and nitrogen into floodplains. These results have played an important role in the development of two key concepts in landscape ecology: the concepts of corridor and connectivity, which are particularly used in conservation biology. In his book \\"Ecologie du paysage\\", written with Odile D√©camps, he presents a synthesis of advances in landscape ecology and introduces the notion of Panarchy and sketches a synthesis between multiple approaches to landscape (in particular that of landscape ecologists in relation to that of landscape ecology).

Vignesh repairs her car and he falls in love with Priya. One day, Ganesh saves Priya from rowdies and he is in love with her too. Priya then meets them on multiple occasions and she befriends the two friends. In the meantime, people are mysteriously killed in the city. Thereafter, Priya interviews the corrupt politician Aalavandhan (Mahanadi Shankar) and unmasks many events done by him. After the interview, a vengeful Aalavandhan tries to rape her in his house but she managed to escape. The night, Aalavandhan is killed by Ganesh who is, in reality, the mysterious killer. Ganesh even kills Priya's best friend Rekha who witnessed the murder of Aalavandhan. Many years ago, the ten-years-old Ganesh lived with his widow mother Uma (Indhu) in a guesthouse. One day, the police suspected Uma to have stolen the jewels of her boss and the police arrested her. At the police station, Uma was stripped of her clothing and her dignity. After this incident, she committed suicide by hanging. A vengeful Ganesh killed the police inspector who humiliated his mother and he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for the murder. When he emerged from the juvenile detention home, Vignesh was a young man who had nowhere to go. He then saw Priya and he fell under her spell. So Ganesh tracked her down, he came to Chennai and he posed as a jobless graduate without any issues. The psychopathy Ganesh then killed anyone who stood in his way or tried to harm his lover Priya. Vignesh and Priya eventually fall in love with each other and they decide to get married. Ganesh then threatens Vignesh to kill him if he marries her. When Priya comes to know that Ganesh is in love with her, she decides to meet him and to settle the problem once and for all.

The Budapest Puppet Theater () has been open since 1949, with its primary venue currently situated at 69 Andr√°ssy √∫t, Budapest. Since then, both children and adults are warmly welcome to their performances, because they have a motto that ‚Äúthe puppet is not the matter of age, but a genre.‚Äù  History of Theatre The former sign of Budapest Puppet Theater The Budapest Puppet Theater is the biggest institution of its kind in Central- Europe and the oldest professional puppet theater in Hungary. It is open since 1949 and has been performing for its audience with the motto, ‚Äúthe puppet is not the matter of age, but a genre.‚Äù The theater's main tasks are to introduce children to the theater and also to make experiments besides keeping the well- established traditions. One can play with puppets in a thousand ways. Since the theatre has been established, they performed with hand and rod puppets hiding behind the screen, dressed up in black velvet to create the perfect illusion with the puppets held out in the light. They have manipulated marionette figures from above, shadow figures from behind, bunraku puppets on the table and giant puppets from inside masks. Fashion changes, traditions are being born and forgotten, but one thing has never changed, the spell of magic of revival of a lifeless animated object for children and adults.Balogh, G√©za. ‚ÄúA b√°b nem k√©r enni‚Äù. A b√°bj√°t√©k Magyarorsz√°gon. A Mesebarlangt√≥l a Budapest B√°bsz√≠nh√°zig. Vince, 2010 The State Puppet Theater opened on the 8th of October in 1949, and it was renamed in 1992 as Budapest Puppet Theater. Not only did the performances for children make the theater famous worldwide, but also the plays created for adults. It has proven the legitimacy and equality of puppetry with other genres of performing arts with the help of sovereign puppet versions of classic dramas and classical pieces. The biggest successes of the company are linked to the unique definitions of classical music adaptations on all the five continents. The theater's company has three stages to play: the main stage, which has around 400 seats, the Orsz√°g Lili Studio, which can be rearranged in several styles. This has 100 seats. The newest, Kem√©ny Henrik Room, has been opened in 2017. The theater has 360-380 performances yearly, which means that they accommodate 100,000 viewers in every theater season. Their foyer houses a gallery named after Ko√≥s Iv√°n, one of the most influential puppet and set designers in Hungary. The carefully timed and thermalized exhibitions put an emphasis on the representation of the past and present of puppetry as an art form showing the designs and works of emblematic puppet designers and theatre companies. In 2010 a festival, called B√ÅBU was established. Its aim is to perform chamber-puppet shows created by pioneer theater companies for adolescent and adult audiences in Budapest. The Budapest Puppet Theater initiated the celebration of World Puppet Day on March 21 in 2014 and since then Hungarian puppet artists in the country and abroad organize feasts and flash mobs. With these series of events the organizers are keen to put an emphasis on the colorfulness of the Hungarian Puppet art, on its own institutions and independent companies and also on the actors who are valuable parts of the productions. On this day the professional and amateur companies, educational institutions and one man shows get the chance to introduce themselves and entertain their audience outside of the buildings of puppet theaters.  70 years anniversary The State Puppet Theater was established on September 1, 1949, and its predecessor was the Fairy Tale Cave, nationalized for the second time, which operated for only one and a half years on the second floor of the Art Theater which is the former Parisien Grill. The only official puppet theater in Hungary immediately moved to 69 Andr√°ssy Avenue, in place of the former National Chamber Theater. In accordance with the cultural policy of that time, at first only pieces for children were shown, even though the new leadership wanted to take a different direction. It was only two years later, from 1951, that is became possible to add adult performances to the repertoire, and since then, the pieces have been produced in the spirit of their motto, ‚Äúthe puppet is not the matter of age, but a genre.‚Äù Until 1958, there was an uncertain period, several directors and chief directors exchanged, and the composition of the company changed constantly too. However, some highly successful performances have shown that Budapest audiences are interested in puppeteer productions: for example, the Star Parade has had snaking lines in front of the cash register for years. In August 1958, a new era began, with the appointment of Dezs≈ë Szil√°gyi stability and peaceful developments started. In the early years, the Gy≈ër State Puppet Theater's program provided the major part of the show, but from 1964, using a completely new language for their repertoire they introduced musical theater performances. It brought amazing success that made Andrassy √∫t the leading puppet theater in Europe in the seventies. This is where Petruska (1965), The Prince of Wood (1965), The Wonderful Mandarin (1969), and J√°nos H√°ry (1972), often still mentioned, were born. From 1971 the theater moved to J√≥kai Square for five years. The new playhouse which was built on the site of the old theater was finished in December, 1976. From then on, the contemporary playhouse operated as the chamber theater of the State Puppet Theater. By the end of the seventies, the genre had been completely renewed in Europe. More and more people questioned the legitimacy of the former illusion theater, many open forms appeared and the animators themselves became more prominent, and it was no longer unusual to see them in a show. In Hungary, puppetry did not develop at this pace, thus the State Puppet Theater program lost its spirit of experimenting, so it was not at all surprising that a group of young artists working here left the institution and established their own workshop in Kecskem√©t. After the change of the regime, more and more companies were formed, among whom some still represented the traditional methods. Szil√°gyi retired in 1992, and he was replaced by Iv√°n Ko√≥s and L√°szl√≥ Vill√°nyi, the former was responsible for the artistic level, the latter took care of the smooth running of the business, but by the end of the first joint season it became apparent that this line was inoperable. In the same year the name of the institution changed, and the theater continues to function as the Budapest Puppet Theater. In 1994 the Arany J√°nos Theater, the only children's theater in the country, was abolished, giving the two puppet theaters in Budapest an even greater responsibility to serve the needs of the youngest. In the same year, J√°nos Meczner, former director of the Arany J√°nos Theater, won the management of the Andr√°ssy Avenue institution. He took over the theater in a time of crisis and it was him who had to make some changes in order to keep up with the constant development of the genre, while preserving its enduring values.  Ars Poetica The main aim of the Budapest Puppet Theater is to raise attention of children towards theater, make them love the genre and to form their theatrical taste. The Budapest Puppet Theater has been performing for over seven decades and it has a special place in the capital city's cultural life. Their job is notable because 80% of their viewers are kindergarten kids or elementary school students, who usually receive their first theater experience in the Puppet Theater. The Puppet Theater is not just a place for entertainment, but also an educational venue. Besides composing the repertory with a literary and artistic concern, both pedagogical and psychological aspects are also considered in the material. A clear description is given to every performance for the audience to be able to decide, which age they are recommended, but those are the best children plays which can be enjoyed by the parents and teachers too. The Budapest Puppet Theater is strongly committed to the idea that the genre of the puppet is for every age- group this is why they constantly expand their repertory to draw the attention of the adult audience as well. Artists working in the Budapest Puppet Theater do not see puppetry as a form, but as an endless source of possibilities. A change of paradigms has taken place in the past 25 years both in the European and in the Hungarian art of puppetry. Puppetry integrates the fellow art forms, and it is more and more common, that classical theatre and dance productions add extra puppet elements in their shows. The puppet genre is capable of methods of expression that the live theater cannot manage to do due to its limitations. Puppet performances compete with the 21st century visual imagery. It is done paradoxically based on a more than hundred year of traditional techniques, focusing on preservation and renaissance at the same time. The Budapest Theater is open-minded and ready to learn. It has well- trained and devoted actors whose work is guarantee for the high quality of the performances and the possibility of improvement.

In contrast to the PCV, the PRP(C) rejected the notion of building alliances with the 'progressive bourgeoisie' for a 'national bourgeois revolution'. The PRP(C) rejected working with the Democratic Action-led CTV trade unions. Instead PRP(C) maintained its own trade union organizations, the most prominent being the bus drivers' union in Caracas and the petrol workers of Puerto de la Cruz and San Joaqu√≠n. Political parties were assigned coloured ballots ahead of the 1947 Venezuelan general election and the PRP(C) was assigned the colour black. Subsequently the PRP(C) became nick-named 'the Black Communists' in contrast to the 'Red Communists' of the PCV (whose ballot papers were red). It was not allowed to field a presidential candidate as it had been legalized posterior to the Constituent Assembly. The PRP(C) obtained 7,068 votes (0.59%) in the 1947 parliamentary election. In the Federal District, PRP(C) had obtained 1,711 votes (0.96%). The party obtained 3,697 votes (0.53%) in the May 1948 municipal elections, but only managed to win a few seats in Anzo√°tegui state. At the time of the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat the PRP(C) argued that the ousted government of R√≥mulo Gallegos had been a puppet of U.S. imperialism, and declined to the defend it. Whilst the military regimes suppressed the PCV, the PRP(C) could work more openly. Its trade union federations in the Federal District and Anzo√°tegui were legalized under the military junta regime. However, after its legalization the Federal District trade union federation was split in two groups, one led by Rodolfo Quinteros and one led by Cruz Villegas. The PRP(C) was disbanded itself in 1952. By this point the party had shrunk and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had called for unity among the Venezuelan communists. Most of its former membership (including Rodolfo Quintero, Cruz Villegas and other leaders) joined PCV. However, Some PRP(C) leaders, such as De la Plaza and Miquilena, never rejoined the PCV.

Poetry  Ash began her career in the arts as a spoken word poet. In a response to one of Ash's spoken word pieces, Carolin Dylla described her as \\"the very real, unpretentious, tattooed incarnation of art‚Äôs most genuine capacities: to create beauty from anger and despair, and to explore ways to create meaning where rational explanation fails.\\" Her poem \\"Lullaby\\" was published online in Riwayya: A Space of Collision in 2015.  Haven for Artists  Ash founded Haven For Artists in 2010. She currently serves as its Executive Director.

The film was released in December 2019 in South Korea. Plot Mt. Paektu, an active volcano straddling the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border, suddenly erupts, causing severe earthquakes in both North and South Korea. Pandemonium ensues on the Korean peninsula, with more eruptions predicted in the area. To prevent another disaster, Jeon Yoo-kyung (Jeon Hye-jin) plans an operation based on a theory by Professor Kang Bong-rae (Ma Dong-seok), who had studied Mt. Baekdu and its possible future eruptions. Jo In-chang (Ha Jung-woo) is assigned to be the captain of a special forces team taking part in the operation. Jo In-chang contacts Lee Joon-pyeong (Lee Byung-hun) who is part of the Korean People's Army in North Korea as a spy. Meanwhile, Jo In-Chang's pregnant wife Choi Ji- young (Bae Suzy) is alone in Seoul, who is struggling to survive against the disaster. In-Chang departs with his team on a plane, and they parachute after their airplane malfunctions. They locate Joon-pyeong, who was being held in a North Korean prison, and seek his knowledge in finding the correct mine closest to Mt. Paektu's caldera. After threatening his dying wife to disclose the location of his daughter, Joon-pyeong guides In-chang's team to a power station, and they extract a piece of uranium from a nuclear missile. This alerts the American garrison in South Korea, who sends soldiers to stop Joon- pyeong from delivering the uranium piece to several gangsters from China. In- chang and Joon-pyeong evade the Americans and reach Bocheon, a town near Mt. Paektu. Joon-pyeong meets his frightened daughter, and just as the Chinese gangsters almost kill him for failing to deliver the uranium, In-chang gives the uranium, but sets its timer to coincide with Mt. Paektu's eruption. Although the American soldiers also arrive to take the uranium, they and the Chinese gangsters flee when Mt. Baekdu erupts again, triggering more earthquakes. In-chang and Joon-pyeong bring the uranium to a mine with Joon- pyeong takes the bomb into the mine's depths, leaving In-chang to go with Joon-pyeong's daughter, which he adopts. The uranium bomb explodes and stops the earthquakes, saving many lives. One year later, North and South Korea together oversee the reconstruction of the peninsula. In-chang and Ji-young have a baby son.

Hundreds of thousands of Colombians demonstrated for various reasons. Some protested against income inequality, corruption, police brutality and various proposed economic and political reforms proposed by the government of Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez, others against the few violent protestors and in favor of the Colombian peace process, etc. While mostly peaceful in nature, a few violent incidents took place throughout the protests, leading to overnight curfews in Cali and Bogot√°. It is \\"one of the largest mass demonstrations Colombia has witnessed in recent years\\". The second phase of the protests, which started on September 10, 2020, were more violent and resulted in 13 people dead.Colombia police brutality: Protests rage for third day in Bogota Background Corruption Comparison of corruption in Colombia with the world average and the least corrupt country worldwide, New Zealand According to 2018 Corruption Perception Index data released by Transparency International to measure public sector corruption in 180 countries and territories, giving each a score from zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Colombia scores 36 points. This is below the global average of 43 points, and makes Colombia the 99th most corrupt country in the world. Protesters have expressed anger at corruption perception in the country. Austerity measures Rumors of possible austerity measures, denied by President Duque, angered left-wing groups, students and indigenous groups. The idea of such measures originated from the introduction of a bill by √Ålvaro Uribe, mentor of President Duque. Peace process Duque has been criticized strongly by human rights organizations for his opposition and ambivalence to the Colombian peace process with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as violence occurring in rural areas of Colombia resulted with the deaths of indigenous leaders. Also both FARC and the right-wing Colombian government have been accused repeatedly of human rights violations and of violating the peace treaty signed by both parties in Havana, Cuba in 2016. Income inequality Inequality in Colombia refers to the existing economic and social inequality in the country. According to World Bank figures, in 2017, Colombia was the second most unequal country in Latin America and the seventh in the world, out of the total of 194 countries that exist on the planet. Despite sustained economic growth of gross domestic product, which stood at 6.6% between 2006‚Äì2014, the inequality index did not drop enough during the peak of the oil boom.https://unperiodico.unal.edu.co/pages/detail/pese-al-crecimiento- economico-colombia-sigue-siendo-uno-de-los-paises-mas-inequitativos-del-mundo As a means of demonstrating, labor unions organized a twelve-hour nationwide strike that was to be held on 21 November 2019, with other groups such as Indigenous leaders, students, and anti-corruption activists. Police brutality Protests against police brutality started in Bogot√°, the country's capital, following the death of Javier Ord√≥√±ez while in police custody on 9 September 2020. The unrest has since spread to many cities throughout Colombia. As of 12 September, 13 people have died and over 400 have been injured as part of the protests. Timeline Time reports that the protesters in Colombia come from all backgrounds, and that they are protesting because of a general displeasure with government actions across a range of issues, triggered to action by rumors of pension cuts. These protests follow smaller student protests earlier in the year that failed to attract many supporters or attention, and have been inspired by the other protests across Latin America. 21 November On 21 November, many Colombians, estimated between 200,000 and over 1 million, protested throughout the country, with the government responding by deploying 170,000 troops. The Colombian government also closed all of its borders. Following similar demonstrations throughout Latin America, protesters displayed flags of Chile and Ecuador and banners reading \\"South America woke up\\", and chanted anti-violence slogans. Demonstrations turned violent, with clashes between police and protesters occurring later in the day and some groups attempting to storm Capitolio Nacional, the building that houses the Congress of Colombia. Fights broke out near the country's international airport, and tear gas was also fired at people at the National University of Bogot√°. During the protests on 21 November, 68 out of 138 TransMilenio stations were vandalized, 48 percent of the system infrastructure. The mayor of Cali imposed a curfew from 19:00 local time until 6:00 the next morning (UTC‚àí5) as a response to violence. In the evening, a spontaneous cacerolazo happened in the capital and several other cities, after which senator Gustavo Petro encouraged more protests. On the first day of protests, three people were killed, with 98 arrested and 273 combined protesters and security forces injured. 22 November The following day, thousands of protesters gathered at Plaza Bol√≠var in the capital Bogot√°, where they were later dispersed with tear gas. In response to the protests, President Duque said that he would open a \\"national conversation\\" after the weekend; the Defence Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said that 11 investigations into \\"alleged misconduct by members of the security forces\\" had begun. Transportation in the capital was largely closed, and road blockades had been built in some areas. Many protests were peaceful, while some instances of looting and the theft of a public bus occurred in the capital city, where a curfew was enforced in the evening. Some protesters ignored the curfew, with others protesting outside of Duque's house through the night. In Santander de Quilichao in the southwest of the country, three police officers were killed, and ten more injured, by a car bomb. After the initial anti-austerity and anti-corruption protests had begun, other groups joined in demonstrations, including environmental action groups, animal rights groups, and women's rights groups. The lootings happening in poorer areas have contributed to an increase in anti-Venezuelan sentiment, with some suspecting Venezuelan migrants to part of the perpetrators. 23 November Protest on 23 November Going into the morning of 23 November, Duque said that he would not recall troops that had been patrolling in the streets, and that the measure was to maintain order. After the previous night's curfew, protesters returned to the streets, with hundreds in the capital's National Park being dispersed with tear gas, and to Plaza Bol√≠var and the Capitol building. When looting happened through protests and rioting, the government referred to the actions as an \\"orchestrated terror campaign\\". One protester was critically wounded on Saturday after being hit in the head by a tear gas canister, prompting other protesters to hold a vigil. The protester died two days later. Responses to the protests Favorable Support of Protest the newly elected mayor of Bogot√°, Claudia L√≥pez Hern√°ndez , spoke in favor and encouraged the citizens of Bogot√° not to fear protesting in peace (that was because the historically right-wing conservative Colombian government has had a long history of repressing protests in the past as a way of silencing dissent to controversial and unpopular and divisive right-wing conservative policies thereby making the armed conflict that has so destroyed the country worse-not to mention that the US news media has ignorance of or outright naivety of the complex issues driving this horrible conflict that must end for good and now. Nowadays it is legal under Colombian Constitution of 1991 however, in practice only progressives and Greens support the right to protest in the political arena) . Various sectors between public and private workers, very important university professors, students from public universities and some from private universities, popular soccer clubs like Millonarios F.C. and Santa Fe and groups from the political left confirmed their participation. Some personalities such as the singers Carlos Vives, Santiago Cruz and Adriana Luc√≠a, the Miss Colombia 2019 Mar√≠a Fernanda Aristiz√°bal, the senator Gustavo Petro, the member of ChocQuibTown Goyo and the actors Juli√°n Rom√°n, Robinson D√≠az and Santiago Alarc√≥n, in addition to the actresses Carolina Guerra, Cecilia Navia, Maria Fernanda Matus, and Margarita Rosa de Francisco, the journalist Daniel Samper Ospina, the humorist Alejandro Ria√±o, the soccer players Natalia Gal√°n, Leicy Santos and Melissa Ort√≠z, as well as the Tour de France champion cyclist Egan Bernal, also joined the movement. International Responses The United Nations and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have demanded that the Office of the Attorney General of the Nation carry out an in-depth investigation to clarify responsibilities. \\"There should be no impunity,\\" said the UN. Miguel Vivanco, HRW director for the Americas, has also addressed the new Defense Minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, to announce \\"measures to prevent this from happening again.\\" The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and important British unionsexpressed their support for the National Strike in Colombia, as did the International Transport Federation (ITF) .155 Likewise, the Latin American Council of Social Sciences (CLACSO) expressed its support for the protests The Portuguese sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos sent an open letter to President Iv√°n Duque to attend to the demands of the strike. The resident singers and Nicky Jam expressed their messages of support for the National Strike, as well as the Uruguayan footballer Nicol√°s Vikonis, who played between 2011 and 2017 in Colombia, Claudio Narea and Miguel Tapia, former members of the Chilean rock band Los Prisioneros, also expressed their support for the strike and the concert \\"Un canto por Colombia\\". September 2020 protests Protests erupted in Bogot√† since September 10, 2020, after the death of a 46-year-old man who was pinned to the ground and repeatedly tasered by police. The victim was drinking in the streets with his friends. Two of the officers involved in the man's death were fired and face charges of homicide and abusing their authority. A further five officers connected to his death have been suspended.Colombia protests: Death of man tasered by police sparks deadly clashes Thirteen people died during the protests and over 400 others were injured. All of the deceased victims were identified as civilians, the majority of whom protestors who were shot dead by police. Also, several injured people suffered gunshot wounds, while close to 200 police officers sustainted injuries during clashes. Sixty police stations were vandalized.Colombia: Protests against police brutality leave 13 dead, over 400 injured See also *List of protests in the 21st century *2020 Colombian protests References External links *CERAC Category:2019 protests Category:2020 protests Category:2019 in Colombia Category:2020 in Colombia Category:Colombian peace process Category:Latin American Spring Category:November 2019 crimes Category:November 2019 events in South America Category:Riots and civil disorder in Colombia ","title":"2019‚Äì2020 Colombian protests"},{"id":"62406497","text":"Michel Delseny (born June 17, 1945) is Director of Research Emeritus at the CNRS and a member of the French Academy of sciences.

Acad. Sci., S√©rie D, (1974), 278, p. 1225-1228 He was among the first to show (during his post-doctoral fellowship in 1979-1980) that the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) DNA, after cloning and amplification in Escherichia coli, was infectious and identical to the original DNA when inoculated to a host plant.M. Delseny and R. Hull, ¬´ Isolation and characterization of faithful and altered clones of the genomes of cauliflower mosaic virus isolates Cabb B-JI, CM4-184, and Bari I ¬ª, Plasmid, (1983), 9, p. 31-41 He was among the first in France to clone and sequence plant DNA in the early 1980s,M.

Grellet et al., ¬´ Organization and evolution of a higher plant alpho√Ød like satellite DNA sequence ¬ª, J. Mol. Biol., (1986), 187, p. 495-507 and, as such, he helped to organize the community of plant biology researchers in France by creating in 1984 with Claude Gigot (IBMC Strasbourg) the CNRS's RCP (Recherche Coop√©rative sur Programme) \\"Isolation, structure et expression du g√©nome nucl√©aire des plantes\\" which is at the origin of the development of plant molecular biology in France. He was the first to report the sequence of the spacer of genes encoding ribosomal RNAs of a dicotyledon in 1988 and to show the bases of ribosomal gene heterogeneity in plants.D.

In January 2020, the system for detecting large-vessel occlusions (LVOs) in head CTA examinations got FDA clearance. In May 2020, the pulmonary embolism system was CE marked. Products and market Aidoc has developed a suite of artificial intelligence products that flag both time-sensitive and time-consuming (for the radiologist) abnormalities across the body. The algorithms are developed with large quantities of data to provide diagnostic aid to a broad set of pathologies. The company offers an array of algorithms that span across the body including Intracranial hemorrhage, spine fractures (C, T & L), free air in the abdomen, pulmonary embolism and more. It developed \\"Always-on AI\\", a term coined by Elad Walach which refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is \\"Always-on\\" - constantly running in the background and automatically analyzing medical imaging data, identifying urgent findings and sparing radiologists from \\"drowning\\" in vast amounts of irrelevant data. Aidoc's solutions cover medical conditions prevalent in all settings (ED/inpatient/outpatient), including level 1 trauma centers, outpatient imaging centers, teleradiology groups and are set up in over 200 medical centers worldwide. Notable customers include the University of Rochester Medical Center, Global Diagnostics Australia, Antwerp University Hospital, and AZ Maria Middelares hospital. According to the company, Aidoc has deep integrations with numerous PACS and workflow software providers (GE, Agfa, Nuance). Clinical Research A clinical study on Aidoc‚Äô accuracy of deep convolutional neural networks for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) on CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) was performed by the University Hospital of Basel and presented at the European Congress of Radiology, showing that the Aidoc algorithm reached 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Clinical research has also been performed to test the diagnostic performance of Aidoc's deep learning-based triage system for the flagging of acute findings in abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations. Overall, the algorithm achieved a 93% sensitivity (91/98, 7 false-negative) and 97% specificity (93/96, 3 false-positive) in the detection of acute abdominal findings. Additional clinical research on Aidoc's Intracranial Hemorrhage algorithm accuracy was presented at the European Congress of Radiology by Antwerp University Hospital, evaluating the use of its deep learning algorithm for the detection of intracranial hemorrhage on non-contrast enhanced CT of the brain. The University of Washington completed a study on the accuracy of Aidoc's intracranial hemorrhage algorithm .

Horatio Cocles, (9 April 1767 ‚Äì 13 August 1849) was a German statesman, editor and writer.  Life  Bentzel-Sternau was born in Mainz. After jurisprudential studies, in 1791 Bentzel-Sternau became government counsellor of the Electorate of Mainz under Karl Theodor von Dalberg in Erfurt. In 1803 he was State councillor of the Kur-Erzkanzler in Regensburg and in 1804 Secret State councillor. In 1806 he entered the Baden services, became ministerial director in 1808 and president of the upper court in 1810 in Mannheim. Dalberg, now Grand Duke of Frankfurt appointed by Napoleon, appointed him Minister of State and Finance in 1811. He was also responsible, among other things, for Jewish emancipation and its bourgeois equality. After the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt had been occupied by the German powers allied against Napoleon in the autumn of 1813 - it was not dissolved until the summer of 1814 - Bentzel-Sternau withdrew into private life. He lived alternately in and his country estate on Lake Zurich. In the following years he worked as an editor and writer. He again proved his liberal and committed attitude as a delegate of the Bavarian Chamber of Estates in the years 1825 to 1828. In 1832 he sympathized with the participants of the Hambach Festival and sent them a letter to express his support.Johann G. A. Wirth: Das Nationalfest der Deutschen zu Hambach. Heft 1. Christmann, Neustadt a/H. 1832, (). In 1827 he converted from Catholicism to evangelical faith. Bentzel-Sternau died in Mariahalden/Z√ºrichsee, Switzerland, at age 82.  Work  Bentzel-Sternau is known to posterity above all as the editor of the magazine 'Jason' and as a novelist. In 1831 he founded the short-lived magazine Der Verfassungsfreund, a newspaper of the Landtag for Germany.Ewald Grothe: Verfassungsgebung und Verfassungskonflikt. Das Kurf√ºrstentum Hessen in der ersten √Ñra Hassenpflug 1830‚Äì1837. , Berlin 1996, . He became famous for his work \\"Anti-Israel-Rede\\" (1818), a projective satire which made him particularly hated by nationalist forces. During the Wartburg Festival his works were symbolically burned with other books. This satire is a rare source for exploring the relationship between Jews and Christians in the 19th century. It is preserved today in only a small number of originals.Horatius Cocles: Anti-Israel. Eine Vorlesung in der geheimen Akademie zum gr√ºnen Esel als Entrittsrede gehalten. Sauerl√§nder, Aarau 1818, Numerised, (Reprint: Anti- Israel. Eine proj√ºdische Satire aus dem Jahre 1818. Nebst den antij√ºdischen Traktaten Friedrich R√ºhs' und Jakob Friedrich Fries' (1816) (Exempla philosemitica. Vol. 4). Published with an epilogue by . Manutius, Heidelberg 2004, ). His best-known work is probably the prose text Das goldene Kalb. A Biography.Das goldene Kalb. Eine Biographie on Google Books In this satire, Bentzel takes up the arguments and demands of the literary Jew hunt, which had found fertile ground after the Congress of Vienna, and takes them to absurdity by exaggerating them. Visionary, the author predicts a development that was soon caught up in the horrors of the anti-Jewish Hep-Hep riots in Germany. Bentzel was apparently aware of the pronounced anti-Jewish dynamics and the great potential for violence that had accumulated against the Jews in the period after the Congress of Vienna - spurred on by inflammatory writings and pamphlets published in many places. Exemplary here are the inflammatory writings of Friedrich R√ºhs and Jakob Friedrich Fries.Also printed in the 2004 reprint by Manutius-Verlag. In his literary publications he shows himself to be an \\"ingenious, outspoken and intelligent humorous writer\\" (Meyer 1858), often compared with Jean Paul.  Pseudonym  The pseudonym chosen by Bentzel-Sternau refers to Horatius Cocles (cocles: Latin for \\"one-eyed man\\"), who was a folk hero of Roman mythology. In 507 B.C. he is said to have defended the bridge over the Tiber to Rome alone against the Etruscans.  Quotes  \\"The mixture, called man, is probably the greatest ragout that ever escaped a heavenly cookbook.\\"  Sources  * Der Verfassungsfreund, ein Landtagsblatt f√ºr Deutschland.Der Verfassungsfreund, ein Landtagsblatt f√ºr Deutschland. in WorldCat Hanau 1831.

Biography  In 1962, Jean D√©nari√© joined INRA, in the soil microbiology laboratory in Versailles. After 5 years of work, he began to study the symbiosis between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus rhizobium. In 1981, Jean D√©naria merged his laboratory with the one run by Pierre Boitard, who used molecular genetic methods to study the interactions between plants and pathogenic microorganisms. The new laboratory is located in Toulouse, in direct affiliation with INRA and CNRS. The research teams are joined by cytologist Georges Truchet and mass spectrometry biochemist Jean- Claude Prom√©. The team made the major discovery of the Nod factors. The team was able to verify that the purified Nod factors could stimulate the development of the root system. Their discovery makes it possible to increase the yields of soya, groundnut, pea and alfalfa crops. Patents are filed, a partnership with an industrial group is initiated, and in 2004 the production of Rhizobium inoculants enriched with Nod factors begins. In 2011, 2 million hectares of crops were fed with nod1 factors. Jean D√©nari√©'s work has since focused on the myc factor and its effects on the root and nutritional system of plants.

It took place on 1 January 1987 at Dalymount Park in Dublin, and was contested by Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers. Dundalk won 1‚Äì0 to win the competition for the third time. Background The League Cup was the first trophy of the 1986‚Äì87 League of Ireland season. Its first round, in which four teams played each other in a double round-robin system, took place before the start of the league schedule. The two sides had met twice already that season, with Shamrock Rovers winning both the President's Cup final and the league fixture in Milltown. Dundalk had last won the competition in 1981. They reached the final by topping their group over Cork City, Drogheda United and EMFA, and then defeating St Patrick's Athletic (in a penalty shoot-out after a 0‚Äì0 draw) and Athlone Town (1‚Äì0). Shamrock Rovers had won the League Cup once previously, in 1976‚Äì77, and had lost on their two previous appearances in the final. In the 1986‚Äì87 season they would go on to win a League and FAI Cup Double, with Dundalk finishing as runners-up in both competitions. Match Summary Both sides went into the match with much-changed sides due to a number of injury problems. Dundalk had three players making debuts, including local-league player Paul Matthews who was signed as cover on New Year's Eve; while manager Turlough O'Connor, was obliged to be listed as '13th player' on the team-sheets. Dundalk's Dessie Gorman missed two early chances before they were awarded a controversial penalty in the 39th minute, when Noel Larkin was adjudged to have fouled Tom McNulty near the goal-line in a tussle for possession. Martin Murray scored the resultant spot-kick, despite it being weakly struck. In a match described as \\"disappointing\\" in press reports, both sides failed subsequently to create any real chances, with Martin Lawlor and Harry McCue performing well at the centre of a makeshift Dundalk defence, and new Rovers player-manager, Dermot Keely (a former Dundalk stalwart) dominating at the back for his side. Dundalk goalkeeper, Alan O'Neill, was forced into making two late saves as they held out. The win was Turlough O'Connor's first trophy as Dundalk manager, and the club's first since 1981‚Äì82.

It conducts research in many countries worldwide, with a particular focus on the Horn of Africa, East Africa, Southeast Asia, the Central Andes, and Switzerland. In terms of teaching, CDE offers courses in the field of sustainable development at the bachelor‚Äôs, master‚Äôs, doctoral, and postdoctoral level.  History  CDE was established in 2009 as a strategic research centre of the University of Bern, under the direction of Peter Messerli and Thomas Breu. Its origins date back to the Group for Development and Environment, founded in 1988 at the Institute of Geography of the University of Bern. This research group was headed by two professors, Hans Hurni and Urs Wiesmann, and initially based on two international research programmes, the Soil Conservation Research Programme in Ethiopia (1981‚Äì1998) and the Laikipia Research Programme in Kenya (1984‚Äì1997). Other major international research programmes followed. These included Terre Tany (1989‚Äì2000) in Madagascar, the Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme (1999‚Äì2015), and programmes in Central Asia, the Mekong region, and the Andes. From 2001 to 2013, CDE was the lead institution of the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) North-South, a Swiss-based international research programme on global change and sustainable development. In 2016, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed CDE Director Peter Messerli to co-chair the independent group of scientists drafting the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) 2019 on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Peter Messerli oversaw completion of the milestone report together with co-chair Endah Murniningtyas, former Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Environment in Indonesia.  Research  CDE conducts research on sustainable development in the context of global change and related impacts on natural resources (soils, water, biodiversity), land systems, and the living conditions of different population groups. It employs researchers from the natural sciences, social sciences, human sciences, humanities, law, and economics. The four main areas of research of CDE‚Äôs interdisciplinary teams are: * Land resources: use of natural resources (water, soil, vegetation); importance of land (access, distribution, rights) and changes and adjustments in management (cultivation techniques, conservation, commodification) for sustainable development. * Socio-economic transitions: global change; measuring poverty and inequality; social and technological innovations in the fields of labour, production, and consumption. * * Sustainability governance: interaction of global and local regulatory systems; GIS-based methods to identify different claims to water, land, or food; policy support. * Education for sustainable development: building competencies for transformations to sustainable development; supporting the University of Bern in implementing sustainability in teaching, research, and operations.  Teaching  CDE offers minors in sustainable development at the bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs level, with currently around 400 students enrolled in these programmes. The International Graduate School (IGS) North-South was created in 2009 as part of the above-mentioned NCCR North-South programme. The IGS North-South is a doctoral programme based on an inter-university agreement between the Universities of Basel, Bern, Lausanne, and Zurich, as well as selected cooperation agreements with universities in countries of the global South and East.

His father responded \\"May his blessing descend upon you, he's a true saint of God, a remover of worries and troubles. Were it not for him I would have died miserably\\".Naguib. M. (1972). \\"Zaabalawi\\", \\"Dunya Allah\\". Al- Qalam Beirut Printing Press p.37 The narrator then mentioned the reason for his search for Sheikh Zaabalawi, and the reason is that he is suffering from a disease that has no medicine. So he went to the house of Sheikh Qamar Khan Khan Jaafar, who was a friend of his father before he died, the narrator states that he found a beautiful woman with a strong perfume smell coming out from the house of Sheikh Qamar and also he mentioned that the Sheikh wears a modern suit and seems to be wealthy, after the narrator introduced himself to the Sheikh asked him about Sheikh Zaabalawi, Sheikh Qamar answered that he barely remembers him and then said that he lives in a place called a quarter of Berjawi in Al-Azhar. The narrator went looking for Zaabalawi in the desired place. Asking People and shops in the neighborhoods about Zaabalawi, and it turns out that the majority of people have never heard of him. And some started to talk about the good days that they have spent with Zaabalawi, and others made fun of him and they told him to go to see a doctor but the narrator responded that he already did, but that was useless.There was no result, and the narrator returned to his house with no hope. And perhaps spend days and months looking for him to no avail, Sheikh painted a map of the place in the smallest details and Present it to the narrator to make it easier for him to search for Zaabalawi. The narrator continues his search from a shop to a neighborhood to a mosque until he was told to go to a calligrapher named Hassanein residing in Umm Ghulam. Indeed, the narrator went to the calligrapher shop and found Hassanein surrounded by paintings engraved the name of God in the middle of a painting. The narrator asked him about Zaabalawi and Hassanein replied that it was difficult to meet, because he appears without a date and cuts off suddenly. He also mentioned that he had inspired him in his paintings. The narrator left hopeless asking people in the streets about Zaabalawi until he found a music composer that it has been said that he had spent time with Zaabalawi, the narrator managed to find the music composer and he asked him about Zaabalawi and the musician said that he knew him, but not anymore after a short conversation about the nights that he had spent with Zaabalawi and how he inspired him to compose his greatest music pieces. And ended his speech by leading the narrator to a person called Wannis Al-Damanhouri who spends his time in a bar inside a hotel and he may know where Zaabalawi is.The narrator went to the bar to find Al Haj Wannis sitting at a table alone drinking wine. The narrator went to the bar to find Haj and Nis sitting at a table alone drinking wine. The narrator spoke to him but he interrupted him, saying: \\"Sit first and get drunk.\\" The narrator tried to explain to him that he doesn't drink alcohol, but Al Haj Wannis did not care. He told him, \\"This is your business and this is my condition.\\" The narrator drank the first and second cup and he forgot why he came, by finishing the fourth cup he fell in a deep sleep. He mentioned that he had the most beautiful dream he had ever seen. And he was in a place full of trees and harmonious music and he felt peace inside of him. He soon woke up to find his head wet with water and he Al Haj Wannis about what happened and he answered that his friend Sheikh Zaabalawi was sitting next to him pouring water gently on his head in the hope that you wake up, the narrator in a state of panic asking \\"Zaabalawi? Where is he? I came to here searching for him and he ran shouting ‚ÄúZaabalawi‚Äù in every corner, but it was useless.But he felt comfortable for some time because it was confirmed that Zaabalawi existed. The narrator returned the next day to the pub hoping to meet Zaabalawi but he didn't find him. Here the story ends and the narrator is still looking for Zaabalawi and whenever he feels disappointed he remembers his sickness and he thinks of Zaabalawi to continue his search for him.  Themes   Quest  One of the most important themes that the story provides is the theme of quest, as we see from the beginning of the story, the narrator has no direct clear destination that has a meaning, or the thing that he is searching for really exists. But instead he is in a searching loop that will never end and that was causing him more sickness that the only thing that could cure it is meeting Sheikh Zaabalawi and then the searching journey will end. Because the sickness that the narrator suffers from is a psychological and even spiritual sickness not a physical one, we saw that the narrator was searching alone, with no company to ease his pressure and that might refer to the Islamic religion because the believer of Allah does not have a priest to confess to. His connection with God is direct, it has no intermediary to make the thing easier. We also don't know anything about the narrator's personality or any details about him and that is symbolic as well. Mahfouz might be representing all people through this character.Gordon,H.(1990). Naguib Mahfouz's Egypt: Existential Themes in His Writings. New York, Greenwood press.  Existential philosophy  The story raised the issue of human existence and its significance, and the search for a goal of life, compared with the novel \\"Waiting for Godo\\" by the Irish writer Samuel Beckett, Zaabalawi refers to the same idea, It is a wait and constant search for an idea that may be spiritual or existential and in the end it does not appear this idea causing disappointment to the searcher, pain and despair, and this issue of research is not new in human history, but it is one of the most important issues that human tried to solve its mystery.  Social criticism  Our narrator's search throughout Cairo, besides moving from West to East, as evidenced in the dress of those whom he meets, is also a movement towards timelessness, evanescence, the eternal now. He begins by meeting a religious lawyer and scholar, Sheikh Qamar. This is interesting because it points in two different directions. First, this is a man well-versed in the Sharia, as all Sufis must be. But this man is also a manifestation of the ossification of a lived religious experience. His dress and his office furnishings give him away as a man tainted by non-Islamic influences. Of course, he is unsure is Zaabalawi is even alive. He has long since lost touch with him. The next person our narrator encounters is the seller of books on theology and mysticism. While he is moving closer to the lived religious experience, the decay of the surroundings, and the fact that this mere prologue to a man is engaged in commerce surrounding what should be a non-commercial activity, tells us that we are still far removed from the mystical experience. The other shopkeepers in the area only reinforce this reading, as they have either not heard of Zaabalawi or they openly make fun of him. Here are two institutions which are hardly momentary. That is, the Sharia, Hadith, and other interpretations of the Qur'an and the Prophet's life have been around since the inception of Islam. The local magistrate of the district is the narrator's next stop, and he is presented with a well drawn-out plan for canvassing the entire area. A map is gridded with coordinates and he must approach this search as scientifically as possible. Again, the attempt here is to codify and regularize what is essentially ineffable. However, we know that we are getting closer to the truth, because this man, at least, knows that Zaabalawi is still alive. He recognizes that Zaabalawi has no permanent residence, for he cannot be captured and pinned down. The prayer of supplication which the Sheikh offers is the first time any one of our narrator's erstwhile helpers has mentioned God. This is fortuitous, for immediately following this ejaculation (please pardon my Christianizing of such spontaneous prayer, but Sufism has no term for this; it is not a Sufi practice or discipline), he offers our narrator this advice: \\"Look carefully in the cafes, the places where the dervishes perform their rites, the mosques and the prayer rooms and the Green Gate, for he may well be concealed among the beggars and be indistinguishable from them.\\" In mentioning the dervishes, the Sheikh has introduced one of the great strands of Sufism, and alluded to Hadhra, one of the five major Sufi practices. But again, the Sheikh is a political leader, a field hardly concerned with the momentary, but rather interested in creating institutions which will last. A calligrapher is the next stop for the narrator, and here we move closer to the capture of the present moment. This artist illustrates passages from the Qur'an, or embellishes the name of god. The narrator interrupts him at his easel, only to find that Zaabalawi has not been to see him in a long time. However, we also see that Zaabalawi has been the inspiration for the artist's most beautiful creations. Here, in the realm of art, beyond politics or commerce or law, we are coming closer to Zaabalawi's true residence. Of course, we run into a great contradiction, concerning the timelessness of art, but I'd like to address that below. It's not until the narrator meets Sheikh Gad, the composer, that we get great detail about the absent mystic. And here, with the musician, in the evanescence of music, we learn the most about him. We could take Schopenhauer's approach, where music is the most pure expression of the Universal Will, and it analogously reflects, within its harmony, melodies, rhythm and meter, the structure of the physical world. This will serve to illustrate the great power of music, but it does not address why Mahfouz places it here, near the core of our narrator's experience. Ernst Roth, the great music publisher, offers an explanation as to why this is so: The musical score, or whatever the graphic representation of music may be called, does not constitute the work in the same simple sense as a canvas or a printed page constitutes a visual or literary work. This is the fundamental difference between music and the other arts: its glory and, if you will, its tragedy. Recreation is not a mechanical process, just as a good cookery book is not a guarantee of good cooking. \\"The real beauty of music cannot be put down on paper,\\" wrote Liszt, and this is not only true of beauty. Neither can the real meaning be laid down once and for all, as in the other arts; it must be guessed at or sensed. There is a void, a space, left in every work of music, which must be filled by the re-creator. (Preface) This recognition of the presentness of music, of the existence of music only in the now, is Mahfouz's first use of the mystical state. Music, then, is both in time and out of it. You cannot find it in the past or the future, only in the present. When you think on it, you are not thinking on music, but only on your experience of it, your memory of it. We have moved from law to commerce to politics to calligraphy to music, and at every step we have come closer to the evanescent, and the ineffable. If we don't get it, Sheikh Gad rams the point home by stating that Zaabalawi himself \\"is the epitome of things musical.\\"Chittick, William C. \\"Mysticism In Islam.\\" David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies,Brigham Young University. Provo, UT. May 2003. Sufism  Sufism  William Chittick, arguably the most prominent scholar of Islamic mysticism in the West, explains the place of mysticism in Islam thus: In short, Muslim scholars who focused their energies on understanding the normative guidelines for the body came to be known as jurists, and those who held that the most important task was to train the mind in achieving correct understanding came to be divided into three main schools of thought ‚Äì theology, philosophy, and Sufism. . . . Most Muslims who devoted their major efforts to developing the spiritual dimensions of the human person came to be known as Sufis. They taught that people must attune their intentions, their love, and their sincerity to the divine will. A Sufi is someone who is striving to or has mastered his or her ego and attained a higher state of consciousness and union with the Godhead. The goal of the Sufi Path is for the drop of water (the individual self) to merge with the Ocean of Being from whence it came. This spiritual path (tariqah) encourages one to perform this or make this transition consciously while still in the body. The central Sufi theory is Wahadat Al Wajud, the Unity of Being, or oneness of existence. This summarizes the Sufi quest of not just seeking a union with the Divine Being, but the realization of the truth that the mystic is one with the Divine. To teach this, the Sufi poets used the imagery of the lover and beloved in the love poetry or romances. According to Hujwiri, the first Sufi in India, he who is purified by love is pure, and he who is absorbed in the Beloved and has abandoned all else is a Sufi.  Other themes the story includes  Attack on fossilized religious institutions; only certain figures such as artists (musicians, the calligrapher) and the drunk seem to be in contact with the truth symbolized by Zaabalawi. An allegory hinting at the possible human significance of religion and its supposedly transcendental symbols; an attempt to redefine God in human, social, and earthly terms. In Mahfouz's vision those who only seek personal gain and profit are distanced from the truth and genuine fulfillment; the happiness of the individual can only come through social engagement and contact with others, the merging of the self into a harmonious human collectivity. In awarding the Nobel Prize for Literature to Mahfouz, the Swedish Academy of Letters noted that \\"through works rich in nuance -- now clearsight only realistic, now evocatively ambiguous -- [Mahfouz] has formed an Arabic narrative art that applies to all mankind.\\"  Literature review  According to John C. Hawley, ‚ÄúIn the progression of his many books, Mahfouz‚Äôs faith in rationalism gradually softens, and he portrays the everlasting hunger for God (lying beneath the tendency toward grasping false gods)‚Äù.Hawley, C. John (1998). Introduction. The Postcolonial Crescent Islam‚Äôs Impact on Contemporary Literature. Ed. John C. Hawley. New York: Peter Lang. p.13 Likewise, the unnamed protagonist's desperate quest for Sheikh Zaabalawi is an allegory of modern man's futile search for God within a corrupt world where humanity has surrendered to materialism long ago. Rasheed El-Enany's definition of Mahfouz's attitude towards religion and God reads as follows: ‚Äú... the totality of [Mahfouz‚Äôs] work appears to communicate a rejection of all forms of institutionalised religion while retaining belief in the abstract idea of God-a version of deism‚Äù.Chittick, William C. \\"Mysticism In Islam.\\" David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies,Brigham Young University. Provo, UT. May 2003. p.81 Indeed, the scene depicting the protagonist's inquiry of the bookseller in front of the Birgawi Residence where Zaabalawi once lived confirmed El-Enany's idea in that the deserted building now looks like a wasteland, occupied only by heaps of rubbish. In Mahfuzian terms the ruined residence stands for the present plight of modern man left without shelter, forsaken by God. As El-Enany states: ‚ÄúIn Mahfouz‚Äôs world picture, the tug-of-war between man and God is an ongoing game. God is gladly fled from, but no sooner this is done than He is again madly sought after. It is a love-hate relationship,‚ÄùEl-Enany, Rasheed (1998). ‚ÄúThe Dichotomy of Islam and Modernity in the Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz.‚Äù The Postcolonial Crescent. Ed. John C. Hawley.

Orhan Pamuk Orhan Pamuk A Strangeness In My Mind; It is an urban novel chronicling the life and love story of an Istanbul street vendor named Mevlut Karata≈ü. The underlying theme in the novel, that is the process of Istanbul‚Äôs transformation from a stagnated city into a booming metropolis, unfolds parallel to the changes taking place in the protagonist‚Äôs life. The novel‚Äôs time span covers the years between 1969 and 2012. Within this period the protagonist, his relatives, and acquaintances witness and narrate the socio-political, cultural, economic, and environmental changes Istanbul undergoes from multiple perspectives. Mevlut comes to Istanbul at the age of twelve to accompany his father who has already migrated to the metropolis from a Central Anatolian village. Turkish people‚Äôs general motive for internal migration at those times was to attain various job opportunities available in the city and earn money that would provide the rest of the family with a decent living either in a rural town or in a poor quarter of the city. The objectives initially include obtaining a well-paid job or investing in a promisingly profitable city commerce that would lead to property ownership, and quick access to all the social facilities like education for the children. Thus, following the same path of his fellow immigrant workers, Mevlut‚Äôs father settles in a desolate slum which is located quite far from the city centre. Until Mevlut drops out of high school education, his daily routine consists of going to the school during day time and helping his father selling boza-a. After the dream of climbing the social ladder through getting a proper education ends, Mevlut falls in love with a girl with stunning dark eyes at a wedding, and spends three years writing love letters to the girl who is living in a neighbouring village close to his. Yet, his later elopement with her turns out to be a failure due to his relatives‚Äô interference. Unknowingly, Mevlut elopes not with Samiha, the owner of the impressive eyes, but her elder sister Rayiha. Mevlut's naive, shy, and compassionate nature prevents him from rejecting his wife and thus he accepts the fate imposed on him.

Architecture The building was listed for the quality of the Victorian design, especially the front of the building, its association with Joseph Wright, and for retaining its original arrangement internally. It is a two-storey building which has a rectangular shaped chapel inside surrounded by a curved gallery. The front elevation has four bays and is built of red brick with decorations in darker coloured brick. It has two central front doors, each capped by a rounded arch and a triangular pediment and flanked by columns with foliate capitals. The doors open onto a set of stone steps.

The complete sixth season DVD was released in North America on November 2, 2010. The season received high critical praise from critics, who commended its tasteful and intelligent handling of Captain Phil Harris' death and the series' emotionally powerful storytelling. Reception Ratings \\"Slow Burn\\", the season premiere, received at the time the highest number of American household viewers in the show's history. The record would be surpassed by later episodes in the season, such as \\"Blown Off Course\\", \\"Empty Throne\\" (5.24 million), \\"Cain and Abel\\" (5.26), and \\"Redemption Day\\" (8.5). Critical response The season received critical acclaim from critics, largely due to the emotional storyline involving Captain Phil Harris, who died in February 2010 after suffering from a stroke. Scott Von Doviak of The A.V. Club stated that due to the passing of Captain Harris prior to the season, episodes from the sixth season became \\"some of the most riveting and emotionally wrenching episodes of any reality series in TV history.\\" Reviewing the season's DVD release, Paul Mavis of DVD Talk considered it to be \\"[t]he most emotionally involving season of the series so far.\\" Michael Hann of The Guardian, while reviewing the box set release of the first ten seasons, gave high praise to season six, considering it \\"one of the most profoundly moving series of TV episodes I‚Äôve ever seen\\".

DelgadoLomas Garc√≠a, p. 218 and starring Cantinflas, Marga L√≥pez and V√≠ctor Alcocer.Garc√≠a Riera, p. 148 Plot S√≥crates Garc√≠a (Cantinflas) is a primary school teacher who is assigned by the principal of the school he works in to administer another school located in the town of El Romeral, as he is the only teacher from that school who is single. When S√≥crates arrives at the train station in the nearby town of San Bartolo, nobody receives him on the station on the orders of the caudillo of El Romeral. S√≥crates instead meets an arriero who is going to the town in his cart and takes S√≥crates to El Romeral. When he arrives in town, he is received by the townspeople, including the municipal president (or mayor), Lucas Campuzano (Eduardo MacGregor) and Don Margarito V√°zquez (V√≠ctor Alcocer), the town's caudillo. The municipal president presents S√≥crates to the important people, but immediately realizes that he was going to have problems with the caudillo. There is also Do√±a Hortensia (Marga L√≥pez), who asks S√≥crates to address the people a few words, but while he gave his speech the floor of the platform he was in collapses. Later, Do√±a Hortensia takes him to her house to host him. He asks where his school is to inspect it, only to discover that the school is in terrible conditions. S√≥crates begins to suffer several difficulties, such as the eviction from the place where the school functioned, forcing him to improvise an open-field school, with columns of reeds, all caused by the town's caudillo Don Margarito and covered by the municipal president. Meanwhile, S√≥crates and Hortensia begin a romance. First, S√≥crates asks Hortensia for some photos; she, without knowing his intentions, brings them, and then S√≥crates tells her that the photos are for his wallet. Grateful, S√≥crates decides to serenade Hortensia with his students. Then, S√≥crates takes his students to a field trip and, despite the apparent inexperience of S√≥crates to camp (despite wearing a boy scout uniform), manages to make his students more loyal to him, to the point that they to dismantle the canteen that was put in place of the school, unleashing a fight in which S√≥crates finally rescues his students. As a result of the fight, Don Margarito and his men burn S√≥crates's improvised open-field school. A frustrated S√≥crates at first decides to leave the town, but the love of Hortensia and the loyalty of his students make him change his mind. The announcement that the Governor of the state (Arturo de C√≥rdova) will make a visit to the town represents a salvation for S√≥crates and the townspeople themselves. Although Don Margarito and his henchmen kidnap S√≥crates to force the people to remain silent, his students manage to rescue him after convincing Felipe to reveal his whereabouts (as Felipe's father is one of Don Margarito's henchmen), in a small hut, and S√≥crates gives the Governor documents that reveal the dirty maneuvers that Don Margarito made with the municipal president to illegally take land from peasants. After discovering the fraud that was being done to the peasants, S√≥crates asks the Governor to build a decent school; the Governor grants the request. The film ends in front of the new school, with S√≥crates and Hortensia walking together as the students sing to them.

It was written in early 1973, and was performed on several occasions before its album release. Similarly to most of Tam√°s Cseh‚Äôs songs, this song was performed with Cseh‚Äôs own guitar chordal.  Synopsis  The song is a tribute to William Shakespeare as a playwright. It enlists three plays of Shakespeare, and admires the characterisation of three main characters, pointing out the psychological reflectiveness of each. All three plays mentioned are tragedies, and all the characters are title characters (Hamlet, Othello and Richard III). The lyrics use the Eastern name order, probably to strengthen the idea represented in the chorus: that William Shakespeare has no equal in the songwriter‚Äôs country, Hungary. Similar ‚ÄúHungarianization‚Äù can be heard in the deliberately hungarianized pronunciation of Shakespeare‚Äôs name: on all the recordings.  Writing, first public performance and recording  Just like most of Tam√°s Cseh‚Äôs songs, the lyrics were written by G√©za Berem√©nyi. It was first performed as part of a performance of Shakespeare‚Äôs comedy, Twelfth Night, on 6 July 1973, in Szentendre. Evidence suggests that the original form did not contain the verses referring to Richard III. The first studio recording of the song was released on Tam√°s Cseh‚Äôs fourth studio album, M≈±csarnok, published by Pepita in 1981. Most songs on the album reflect on well-known writers and poets, such as Arthur Rimbaud, S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Abbot Beda Angehrn around 1770 Family coat of arms Crossing over the Sitter with the tollhouse (middle) erected by Abbot Beda.  Life  Johann Konrad Angehrn was the son of the surgeon and Gerichtsammann Johann Konrad and his wife Maria Katharina (n√©e Willi). He studied at the Jesuit College Konstanz and later at the benedictine Abbey of Saint Gall. He took his vows in the Abbey in 1744 and was given the monastic name Beda. He was subsequently ordained priest in 1749. He taught theology and philosophy in St. Gallen for 12 years. In 1753 he was made professor of theology. In 1763 Beda was appointed prior and Stadtholder of St. Johann in the Thur valley. On 11 March 1767 the Nuncio Luigi Valenti Gonzaga presided the election where Beda was ultimately elected abbot. Pope Clement XIII confirmed the election on 27 April 1767, while the benediction was given by the Nuncio on 8 September 1767. On 19 December 1767, Emperor Joseph II granted him the Jura Regalia. Abbot Beda achieved lasting significance through his efforts in road construction. The F√ºrstenlandstrasse connecting Rorschach, St. Gallen, and Wil is generally regarded as his most important work and is an important connection between the abbey-principality and the Old Swiss Confederacy. The military and scientific endeavour of the Abbey were also lastingly improved by the Abbot. However, in his plans he failed to consider the available means, which led to the ruin of the Abbey's finances. He also disregarded the control rights of the chapter and ruled his realm autocratically. A few younger monks lodged complaint against the Abbot that reached the pope, but to no avail. After the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, the Gotteshausleute, i.e. the inhabitants of the Abbey, demanded more rights. When lamentations culminated in revolutionary movements in 1794, Prince-abbot Beda yielded remarkably easily. Despite his chapter being against him, he made wide admissions without much resistance. In the \\"G√ºtlicher Vertrag\\" (amicable agreement) of Gossau of 1795 he abolished the serfdom and abandoned further feudal rights or narrowed them. The convent agreed to the treaty on 18 January 1796. Abbot Beda died on 19 May 1796 in Saint Gall.  Works  * Oraison fun√®bre de ...

The monk Rumo was a member of the noble family of Ramstein.

He staged an economic buy-out of the abbey while disputes with abbey subjects in Appenzell and the Klostervogt were exacerbating the state of affairs. As a result, Rumo abdicated his position in 1281 for a yearly compensation of 100 marks. The document detailing the amount and origin of his pension is dated 15 January 1282.

Life  It is not recorded whether Heinrich von Ramstein was related to his predecessor Rumo von Ramstein or the abbot of Reichenau Abbey, Albrecht von Ramstein. However, he may have been related to Abbot Berchtold von Falkenstein, who was abbot at the time he entered the convent. He was probably one of four contemporary Heinrichs who lived among the members of the convent who were eligible to vote in 1270. His first mention by full name dates from 1275. Heinrich was one of four monks who had stood by Rumo. From 1278 he appears as porter. He is one of the three monks who lodged a complaint against Abbot Wilhelm von Montfort with King Rudolf. On 11 October 1301 he was elected abbot. However, two conventuals proposed a different candidate, Ulrich von Trauchburg, who was also keen on the office. The resulting dispute was handled by financially compensatin Ulrich. Heinrich also gained the intercession of the bishop of Constance by leaving him Wurmlingen. The ordination took place in St. George's Abbey in Stein am Rhein. On 7 December 1301 King Albert bestowed the jura regalia on Heinrich, but disallowed another pledging of the Reichsvogtei. One of the principal reasons for this was the resistance of the citizens of St. Gall. He fell ill halfway through the year 1316 at over 90 years old and died two years later.  Works  Heinrich von Ramstein also encountered resistance against all his efforts as abbot. He tried to pay the inherited debt by two means; the first was to sell abbey property. The second measure, namely raising taxes, led to opposition within the abbey. The protests and wishes of Conventuals were so great that he had to name his brother Diethelm as guardian of the abbey for three years. Rebuilding Wil presented the next problem. Albert denied Heinrich's wishes to rebuild the city ‚Äì as well as the demolition of Schwarzenbach ‚Äì because the King claimed the Vogtei over Wil, among other reasons. The death of the king did not solve the issue, as King Henry VII also did not yield the \\"Vogtei\\". Even so, he did confirm the old rights on 17 April 1309. Heinrich did regain control of the Vogtei over Wil on 1 May 1310. A settlement of the pledge sum of 1300 Mark, which was agreed upon with Adolf of Nassau was reached on 22 April 1311. The city and the abbey of St. Gallen fell victim to a devastating fire on 13 October 1314, prompting Heinrich to task Provost Heinrich von Lupfen and the citizen Konrad Kuchimeister with the reconstruction of the abbey.

United States, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that state robbery offenses that involve overcoming victim resistance count as \\"violent felonies\\" under the definition of that term under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, even when only 'slight force' is required. Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, defendants with three or more violent felonies can face higher sentences when subsequently convicted of a federal firearms-related offense. This case upheld a ruling by the 11th Circuit. This case was notable because it was the first Supreme Court case heard by Brett Kavanaugh following his appointment to the Supreme Court, and because of the 'unusual' distribution of votes, with Stephen Breyer siding with the more conservative wing of the Court to uphold the 11th circuit's ruling.  Background  The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a federal law passed in 1984, requires a mandatory 15-year sentence to firearms defendants convicted of three or more violent felonies. The definition of what constituted a violent felony is broad and largely reflects the diversity of state law. The Supreme Court has held that, for the purpose of defining whether or not a state robbery offense constitutes a 'violent felony' under the ACCA definition, courts must apply a 'categorical' rule: do the elements of the robbery offense, as defined in the state's robbery statute, meet the requirements of violence under the ACCA? In 2015, Florida man Denard Stokeling, who had 3 previous convictions for home invasion, kidnapping, and robbery, was arrested during the investigation of a robbery at a Miami Beach restaurant. Though he was not charged with that robbery, he was caught with an illegal firearm in his possession. After Stokeling pled guilty to the firearms charge, prosecutors argued that he should be sentenced under the provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act, which imposed a mandatory 15-year sentence due to his previous 3 convictions. Stokeling appealed his sentencing under the ACCA, arguing that his previous robbery conviction -- an incident in which Stokeling snatched a necklace from a victim -- did not qualify as a 'violent' felony. Specifically, his argument was that the Florida robbery statute did not meet the elements of a violent felony under the ACCA since he could have been convicted even without evidence that he used violent force to overcome his victim's resistance, under the terms of the law.  In lower courts  Stokeling appealed his sentence to the Southern District of Florida Court, which evaluated whether the specific facts and circumstances of Stokeling's prior necklace-snatching conviction was sufficient to meet the requirements of the ACCA. The District Court held that Stokeling's prior robbery conviction did not meet the requirements and reduced his mandatory minimum sentence by half. The United States government appealed this decision to the Eleventh Circuit, which reversed the District Court's decision. Stokeling appealed his case to the Supreme Court in August 2017 and the Supreme Court granted his writ of certiorari in April 2018. Stokeling was represented by Brenda Bryn of the Office of the Federal Public Defender of the Southern District Court of Florida. The United States was represented by Assistant Solicitor General Erica Ross.  Supreme Court ruling   Majority  The Supreme Court upheld the Eleventh Circuit's ruling. In a 5-4 decision, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the Florida statute fit within the guideline set by past Supreme Court precedent and the current interpretation of the Armed Career Criminal Act. He wrote: > ‚ÄúRobbery that must overpower a victim‚Äôs will ‚Äî even a feeble or weak-willed > victim ‚Äî necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle. The > altercation need not cause pain or injury or even be prolonged; it is the > physical contest between the criminal and the victim that is itself ‚Äòcapable > of causing physical pain or injury.‚Äô\\" Thomas's opinion was heavily grounded in common law jurisprudence and legislative history, and noted that between 31 and 46 states had statutes that mirrored Florida's and that Congress had intended to accommodate rather than invalidate these statutes.  Dissent  In her dissent, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts as well as Justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that Congress did not explicitly adopt the common law definition for robbery, and that the interpretation adopted by the majority would encompass too broad a range of crimes. She also argued that the majority opinion did not closely hew to the framework laid out in the previous Supreme Court opinion authored by Antonin Scalia, Johnson v. United States.

The epidemic started in early 2019 in the southeast corner of the DRC and then spread to all provinces. By June 2019 the epidemic was reported to have exceeded the death toll of the concurrent Ebola epidemic. By April 2020, it had infected more than 341,000 people and claimed about 6,400 fatalities. This has primarily affected children under the age of five, representing 74% of infections and nearly 90% of deaths. In response, a vaccination program had been set up by the Ministry of Public Health with the aim to vaccinate more than 20 million children under the age of five. In 2018, the measles vaccination rate was 57%. The effort is supported by the Measles & Rubella Initiative, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and GAVI, a vaccine alliance. Also, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res started conducting vaccination campaigns. Vaccination programs have been hampered by access to health resources, lack of resources, security issues, and mistrust. The measles outbreak in the DRC has been the largest and most fatal measles outbreak across the world in 2019. In April 2020 it was reported that due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination program for measles was suspended. On 24th August 2020, the outbreak was declared over with final results of over 380,766 cases and 7,018 deaths.http://outbreaknewstoday.com/drc-more-ebola-and-plague-cases-reported- end-of-measles-epidemic-declared-74655/ See also * List of epidemics * 2019 Samoa measles outbreak * 2019 Tonga measles outbreak * 2019 New Zealand measles outbreak * 2019 Philippines measles outbreak * Measles resurgence in the United States * Vaccination * Vaccine hesitancy References Category:Disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Democratic Republic of the Congo Democratic Republic of the Congo Measles Measles ","title":"2019‚Äì2020 measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"id":"62407892","text":"Miro Mihoviloviƒá (22 February 1915 - 12 February 2010) was a Croatian water polo player.

It is located in the Haud region, near the lake of Qoob Fardood. It was created as a form of remembrance of the anti-colonial struggle. It has been described as one of the main tourist sites in the region. The site has a nearby family of nomads who act as custodians who live there. They said that the most frequent visitors to the monument are the Arale Mahad and Ali Gheri, due to the fact that they were the most persistent dervishes. Eric Swayne described Qoob Fardood as being located in the homelands of the Ali Gheri, a tribe whose historical homeland is in the Haud regionPrunier, G√©rard. \\"Segmentarit√© et violence dans l'espace somali, 1840-1992 (Segmentation and Violence among the Somali, 1840-1992).\\" Cahiers d'√©tudes africaines (1997): 379-401., stating: > This Haji Muhammad Abdullah belongs to the Habr Suleiman Ogaden tribe; he > married into the Dolbahanta Ali Gheri, amongst whom he now lives.

Douglas James Jardine, who wrote the first retrospective book on the dervishes, concurred with Swayne that Dhulbahante created the Dervishes, described the Dhulbahante relationship with the Sayid as follows: > and consciences were salved by the reflection that our obligation to protect > the tribe from the man whom they themselves had created, supported and > followed was less than our obligations to the Ishaak tribes who had for the > most part resisted the movement from its very start.

Its unique setting together with its long history makes this monasterial complex one of the most prestigious monuments in the wider region of Epirus and a point of reference for Greek history. History According to an inscription of 1561, the monastery was founded in the 7th century by Emperor Constantine Pogonatos (), to whom the establishment of the Archbishopric of Pogoniani is also attributed. While the seat of the archbishop was indeed at Molyvdoskepastos (then known as Depalitsa or Dipalitsa), the diocese first appears in the Notitiae Episcopatuum during the reign of Andronikos III Palaiologos (). Furthermore, the earliest remains in the area date to no earlier than the 11th century (ruined church of St. Demetrios), and the catholicon of the monastery dates to the 13th/14th century. During Ottoman rule, the monastery was a spiritual, cultural, and economic center of the area. Indicatively, in the 14th century a school for scribes was set up in which priest-teachers taught the art of transcription of manuscripts to monks and lay people. It is noteworthy that many scholars and writers of the time graduated from this school. The monastery had large dependencies (metochia) in the Danubian Principalities. Outside its walls, to the northwest, there was a large commercial center the so called, even today, Pazari area, which assisted the monastery‚Äôs finances. After 1913 the monastery remained without monks, its properties were encroached and its holy artifacts and relics were stolen. In 1943, when the area was bombarded by the Nazis, it was almost razed to the ground. The cells and the archive were burnt down and the catholicon was plundered. In 1988 the monastery was manned once more by the present day brotherhood with the encouragement and guidance of the recently canonized Saint Paisios the Athonite and the blessings of the late Metropolitan Sebastianos. Architecture of the Catholicon Panagia Molyvdoskepastos The catholicon of the monastery features a unique architectural style which evolved with the gradual increase of the Monastery‚Äôs needs, both liturgical and practical. This architectural particularity also appears in the way the iconographic cycles were organized on the church walls. The original catholicon, according to an inscription attributed to its founder, was built by the Emperor Constantine Pogonatos. More specifically, the existing catholicon underwent three architectural phases of modification. * 1st phase: During the 11th and 12th centuries the original church was rebuilt into a small cross‚Äìplan church with three vaults and a dome. * 2nd phase: At the end of the 13th century and in the beginning of the 14th the middle cross vaulted section was added by the megas doux Andronikos Komnenos Palaiologos. At about the same time two chapels were added: that of old Timios Prodromos (Saint John the Baptist) in the south, and Agia Paraskevi (Saint Paraskevi) in the north. * 3rd phase: Around the year 1521 inhabitants of the nearby village old Pogoniani carried out renovations to the catholicon and added a large narthex (the Lite) consisting of three parts. Frescoes of the catholicon The existing frescoes of the catholicon are in some places in three successive layers: one Byzantine and two post ‚Äì Byzantine. The older frescos of the church date back to the beginning of the 14th century. Two iconographers of different styles but of the same technique can be distinguished probably belonging to the same workshop. The catholicon was painted once more in 1521-2 covering over parts of the original Byzantine frescoes by an iconographer who apparently wanted to remain anonymous as he characteristically signs ‚ÄúGod knows whose all this labour was‚Äù. Nowadays both layers, although overlapping, can be discerned in the lower parts of the western wing of the cross- vaulted section. In 1537, after extensive damage, possibly from an earthquake, architectural parts were added to the Naive (enlargement of arches, columns, etc) and it was decorated anew by Eustathios Iakovou, a protonotarios from Arta, whose signature appears on the hagiography of the historical chapel of the monastery of Mavriotissa in Kastoria. Miracle-Working Icon of Panagia Molyvdoskepastos The monastery houses a \\"miracle-working\\" icon of the Panagia. The creation of the icon is unknown. After being stolen and left exposed to weather, it suffered great damage. The rotten parts were cut off and it was retouched in parts. There are historical references to a number of thefts of the icon as well as its subsequent return to the monastery.

Biography  Traor√© was born on May 11, 1973 in Joal-Fadiouth, Senegal, the son of Sidiki Traor√©, a Bambara man who moved to Paris to work as a railway worker, and Anna Faye, a Serer woman who had practised voodoo rituals on Mamadou since his birth. When he was born, it was alleged that he was saved from being a stillbirth through his mother sprinkling blood on him, thus making him a \\"child of the spirits\\". When he was three years old, he joined his father in France, followed by his mother and brother, Ousseynou, a year later. Mamadou spent his childhood in Paris, where his two sisters were born in 1978 and 1980.His schooling was rather disturbed: at the kindergarten in Choisy, he was sometimes violent and aggressive (biting his teacher), and at others very kind. In primary, he had to retake his CP, and then his CE1. Labeled as \\"insufficient and undisciplined\\", he was expelled from school at the end of the sixth grade.\\"Mamadou Traor√©, the 'bewitched' murderer. He explained at the trial to acting under the influence of an evil grigri offered by his father\\" Article by Patricia Tourancheau published on February 8, 2000 in Lib√©ration. In 1986, his parents separated, and Mamadou blamed the divorce on his father, whom he accused of spending all the money on the home. He then left the family environment, becoming homeless in the process. His father then got acquianted with a Mr. Yobo, whom Mamadou considered a usurper.Soon after, Traor√© got involved in street crime. From March 1988 to June 1989, he committed several violent assaults with knives. Eventually, he rubbed shoulders with the juvenile judges and educators; he was then put under surveillance, from which he escaped. In the summer of 1989, his mother took him to Senegal on holidays, where he would stay for five years. His maternal uncles were very strict about his education, using corporal punishment. Mamadou eventually became a canoe fisherman and football champion, moving to Dakar with his paternal grandmother. He sold clothes with a cousin, and even had plans of marrying an Ivorian woman, from whom he contracted HIV.In 1994, he returned to France to do his military service, during which he learned that he had HIV, and then tried to reform himself. On March 12, 1996, his mother, who had had two children from her new companion (a boy and a girl), kicked him out the house for smoking hashish. He then tried to defenestrate the 6th floor of the building. Mamadou Traor√© wanted to take revenge on women. He was rampant in area of Paris, particularly in the 12th and 13th arrondissements, striking his victims so violently that they no longer remembered their aggressor, remaining temporarily amnesiac and, moreover, disfigured. He was arrested around 10 PM, on December 17, 1996. Before said arrest, he had been sentenced for previous offences a total of three times in 1996 (in March for use and possession of narcotics, a 5,000 franc fine; a suspended year in prison and 240 hours of community service in June for robbery; and finally, on September 17th for assaulting several people in a laundry in the 13th arrondissement, near the highschool where he was educated - the owner of the laundry had called, complaining that his son had been attacked and threatened with a knife by Mamadou Traor√©. He was fined and placed under judicial supervision, which he did not respect, for which an arrest warrant was issued for him, but nothing came from it.)  Crimes and investigation  Between April 23 and October 30, 1996, Mamadou Traor√© assaulted six women, two of whom died: On the morning of April 23, at around 2 AM, Danielle Baty, a 35-year-old trilingual secretary, was attacked by Traor√© in front of the \\"Queen Bee\\", a karaoke bar near her home. He hit her twice to steal her bag, and then dragged her to the entrance hall of a building, close to where she lived. There, he hit her many times until she lost consciousness. Baty was discovered around 7 AM by a bookseller, partially undressed. It took her about a year and a half to recover. On the morning of June 4, around 4 PM, an 11-year-old was beaten by Mamadou Traor√©. He wanted to rob a house in the middle of the night, and managed to find one window which was open. As he went through it, he heard a voice say \\"Who is it?\\". Frightened and panicked, Traor√© beat up the little girl, as she was in his way, before escaping. On the morning of August 25, around 5 PM, 45-year-old Nelly Bertrand was walking her dog before going to work at the Austerlitz station. Suddenly, she was attacked by Traor√©, whom struck her many times, dragging her into a nearby building's elevator and then down the stairs until he reached the front door of the top floor. Bertrand died following the violent blows inflicted by Mamadou. She was discovered half-naked around 8 PM by the police, as alerted by the guard of the neighboring building. When examined, it was discovered that she had been sexually assaulted. On the morning of October 22, around 4 PM, 20-year-old Marie-Astrid Clair, a modern literature student at the Sorbonne, was attacked by Traor√©, whom had been stalking her, while she was dialing the doorway code to her home. He hit her, then dragged her to the garbage room of a neighboring building, where he raped her. She did not leave the hospital until three weeks later. Mamadou Traor√© had not transmitted HIV when he raped her. On October 25, Traor√© burglarized the property of 75-year-old Francine Sarret in the middle of the night. He went into the bedroom, where Francine woke up, panicking. Mamadou took a pillow and smothered her, before hitting and raping Sarret, whom later died from her injuries. He later declared that he was a gigolo and that Sarret was his \\"client\\", a claim denied by the son of Mrs. Sarret. On October 30, at 10 PM, the 35-year-old chef de Cabinet of minister Jean-Claude Gaudin, Laurence Eymieux, was attacked. Traor√© had been lurking in the basement of an underground car park, in the residence where Eymieux lived. She screamed when she encoutered him, as she leaving to get her car parked. Panicked, Traor√© hit her several times before leaving, but his violent impulses overtook him, and he returned. He dragged Laurence 125 meters away to the isolated exit area of the service staircase, where he continued hitting Eymieux, as well as molesting her. She was found by a neighbor and the guard on 8 AM the following day. Around 8 PM on the day of the crime, Annie, a neighbor who had just parked her car, had called out Mamadou, driving him out of the car park. Her testimony later led to his arrest.

Some now have permanent injuries, among them Danielle Baty, who has lost her senses of smell and taste. This extreme violence made the investigators think that he had used a bat, while in reality, he had used only his bare hands. On February 7, 2000, the trial of Mamadou Traor√© began at the cour d'assises in Paris. Philippe Bilger was the General Counsel, Philippe Lemaire was the lawyer of the fourth victim, Marie-Astrid Clair, and Fran√ßois Honnorat acted as Traor√©'s defense lawyer. On February 15th, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a 22-year mandatory prison sentence. It is supposed that he is currently incarcerated at a psychiatric hospital rather in prison, because of his violent behavior towards fellow inmates and prison guards. In addition, Traor√© claimed that he was not responsible for any of the crimes he was convicted of - instead, he claimed to be a marabout√© since childhood, the Vodun practises and his mother branding him \\"the Devil's child\\" made him do it. The psychiatric expert Martel interpreted \\"his unshakeable belief in maraboutage\\" as \\"a delusional process\\", while Dubec rather saw it as \\"a rationalization\\" and \\"the beginning of a psychic work\\". In his view, the discovery that he had HIV in 1995 and the rejection at the hands of his mother in 1996, led to a \\"displaced matricide\\".

It was in this country that she carried out most of her professional activity. She was a correspondent for Spain‚Äôs Efe news agency and Avui daily, and El Mundo newspaper contributor. Watkins was well known for her research on the conditions of the nikkei, descendants of the Japanese diaspora who come to Japan in search of work not knowing the language or the culture.Bonilla, J. (July 10, 1999). ‚ÄúUn sello editorial trae a Espa√±a aut√©nticas joyas del japon√©s‚Äù. Madrid, Espa√±a. Esfera, El Mundo, p. 11. She is considered a pioneer in the direct translation into Spanish of Japanese literature. As an editor and translator, she always chose works by deeply engaged authors such as Kenji Miyazawa, Natsume S≈çseki, Osamu Dazai and Toson Shimazaki.  Biography  Montse Watkins Pedra was born in the neighborhood of La Salut (Gr√†cia district, Barcelona) on August 27, 1955, to Esteban Watkins Lafuente and Mar√≠a Teresa Pedra Gil. Her father was vice secretary general of the Catalan Football Federation for 38 years, while her mother kept house. She had a sister, Maite, two years younger. When Montse was three years old, the family moved to the Horta neighborhood (Barcelona). There, Watkins went to a nun‚Äôs school (Dominican Sisters of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin), where she showed herself to be quite bright and to have a gift for languages. She later studied Agricultural Engineering at the Barcelona School of Industrial Engineering, as well as Philology for a year (1984). In March 1985, Watkins traveled to Japan, where she immersed herself in the Japanese language and culture. ‚ÄúI came in search of adventure, thinking of the Japan shown in Yasujir≈ç Ozu‚Äôs films, a refined image,‚Äù she explained in an interview published in 1999. She stayed in Japan until her death, and never returned to Spain. For three years, she studied Japanese in the prestigious Saint Joseph‚Äôs Institute of Japanese Studies in Roppongi (Tokyo), run by Franciscan friars, while living in an apartment in Tokyo‚Äôs Itabashi municipality. It was during this first period as a student in Tokyo that she began translating the writer and poet Kenji Miyazawa (1896-1933), specifically his Ginga tetsud≈ç no yoru, which she would publish in 1994 with the title Tren nocturno de la V√≠a L√°ctea [Night on the Galactic Railroad] under Luna Books, the publishing company that Watkins founded in Tokyo under the Japanese publishing house Gendaikikakushitsu, founded by editors Masakuni Ota and Hideko Karasawa. She was the first ‚Äútranslator as well as editor‚Äù of Japanese literature into Spanish, and a pioneer of Spanish translation directly from the Japanese original. In 1988 Watkins joined the Spanish news agency Efe‚Äôs Tokyo delegation staff, where she remained for seven years until 1995. From then on, she was a correspondent for the Catalan newspaper Avui, with which she kept collaborating for the rest of her life. She also collaborated with the daily El Mundo. In 1991 she met Tomi Okiyama, a Brazilian of Japanese ancestry, who would be her partner until her death. He was a member of the Latin American Worker Support Committee (CATLA). This meeting was a turning point in Watkins‚Äô life. Along with her interest in Japanese language and culture, she now developed a concern for the conditions of the Latin American workers (mostly of Japanese ancestry) established in Japan from 1989 on, as a result of changes in this country‚Äôs migration policies. Watkins wrote two key monographs about the arrival and presence of Latin Americans in Japan, a research field in which she is considered a pioneer as well. In 1994 she founded Luna Books publishing house, where she published her own translations and those of other experts, journalistic essays and fiction works. The Japan Foundation sponsored some of those publications. In October 1995, she began to write the column Octavo d√≠a [Eighth day] for the Spanish-language Japanese weekly International Press - En espa√±ol, founded in 1994 and aimed for the Latin American community. Later, Octavo d√≠a would become A vista de p√°jaro [Bird‚Äôs-eye view]. This collaboration continued uninterrupted until October 2000, the month before her passing, due to cancer, in a Kamakura hospital. She also published opinion pieces in several other Spanish-language Japanese periodicals such as Musashi and Kyodai. Watkins‚Äô biography is being written and the documentary ‚ÄúMontse Watkins: Kamakura Tales‚Äù being filmed by the journalist and documentary filmmaker Chelo Alvarez-Stehle, an initiative sponsored by the researcher Elena Gallego Andrada.√Ålvarez-Stehle, C.

He is mostly known for his project Ornitographies, that makes visible the beauty of bird flight paths. His work has been published in magazines like National Geographic and newspapers like The Guardian.  Biography  Xavi Bou born in Barcelona in 1979 and raised in Prat del Llobregat. Xavi's love for nature began from a very young age thanks to many walks with his grandfather to the wetlands of Delta del Llobregat.. In 2003 he graduated in geology at the University of Barcelona and in photography at Grisart International Photography School. After 2003 he focused on the world of fashion and advertising, working as a lighting technician for several photographers. In 2009 he founded LaCrin Studio together with a business partner, Daniel Ciprian. The studio specialized in photographic post- production that works for brands and magazines in Spain and abroad. Also for four years, he taught several courses in the areas of digital photography and post-production for the Grisart Photography School. In 2012 he embarked on Ornitographies. Since then, this project became in his full-time dedication.  Ornitographies  Bou's aim in creating this project is to show the hidden beauty of nature. He focuses on bird flights capturing the elusive contours drawn by birds in motion, or, as he says, \\"to make visible the invisible\\". Bou says that he feels like a curator looking for hidden drawings that birds make in the sky with their flights. Depending on the type of flight, the result could be regular patterns, like flamingoes in a V formation, or chaotic lines like swifts looking for insects in the air. One of the favorite birds are clouds of starlings when they do their famous murmuration dance. Especially when this group is behind attacked by hawks, as Bou says in an Atlas Obscura article: \\"I am passionate about the idea of how a sculptor, the hawk, shapes the shapes of starling clouds\\", he says. With this project Bou created a multimedia project called Murmurations. Most of the images were made in Catalonia or in the area of the Iberian Peninsula. However, he also worked in Iceland and the United States.  Technique  To show several seconds into a single image Bou uses the chronophotography technique. It is a technique created at the end of the 19th century, known through its main representatives: Eadweard Muybridge, √âtienne-Jules Marey and Ottomar Ansch√ºtz. This consists of taking many photographs in a row and then combining them all into a single one. In the first stage of the study, in which Bou invested five years, he used his own camera. Subsequently, to perfect the technique and photographs, he used professional digital cinema cameras. These cameras allow him to take 25 to 120 frames in a second at a high-resolution.  Publications  Since the first publication in 2012 the project has caught the attention of many media around the world; the most remarkable was the eight page article in the January 2018 issue of the National Geographic international edition. Also in newspapers like The GuardianUK, Volkskrant in the Netherlands, Der Spiegel in Germany, De Morgen in Belgium, and also digital media like CNN, Quartz, Vice, Atlas Obscura, Boooooom or DW Euromaxx among others.

Owned and operated by Metro Transit, it is one of the busiest single boarding locations in the Twin Cities. The transit center is not a park and ride, but provides free 10-minute parking and free outdoor bike racks. June 8, 2019 Metro Transit's second bus rapid transit line, the METRO C Line, opened with Brooklyn Center Transit Center as the line's northern terminus. The center will also be the northern terminus for the planned METRO D Line, expected to open 2021. The transit center opened December 4th, 2004 and cost $1.9 million. Before opening of the C Line, charging stations were installed for end-of-the-line charging of 8 battery electric buses used on the C Line. Renovation In mid-2020 Metro Transit plans on renovating the 15-year-old transit center to provide a better experience for customers. Since the opening of the Metro C Line in June 2019, the transit center has seen an increase in traffic. In an interview, Metro Transit Spokesperson Howie Pandilla said \\"When you have a transit center that's been used as much as this has, it can come to look used. It needs a facelift every once in a while.\\" The renovation is not funded as part of either the C Line or D Line projects, but through Metro Transit's capital improvements budget. Current plans call for replacement of concrete and crosswalks, as well as other accessibility improvements, additional lighting both inside and outside the facility, canopies for plazas at either end of the building, bench replacement, additional bike racks, a renovated waiting area and restrooms, and a renovated drivers' lounge. In February 2020, Star Tribune insinuated that a police substation would be added to the existing building, but there are no plans to construct police facilities. The renovation is expected to be complete late 2020.

In the 1960s, she began to sing mainly traditional folk songs and children's songs. After singing Jesper Jensen's controversial song \\"√òjet\\" (The Eye) on the TV programme Musikalske venner (Musical Friends) in 1970, she gained immediate popularity. A few years later, her album Hej s√∏ster (Hi Sister) with her own songs about the problems faced by women saw the beginning of a successful career as both a song writer and a singer. She suddenly completely retired from the limelight in 1988, thereafter concentrating her humanitarian and cultural interests. In particular, she produced programmes for children on Danish television. Early life Born on 6 March 1945 in Copenhagen, Gudrun Bodil Nielsen was the third child of the dental technician Niels Otto Nielsen (1913‚Äì1952) and Ragnhild Eleonore Kirstine Hansen (1912‚Äì1992), a secretary. After her father died of kidney problems when she was seven, she was brought up by her mother on the island of Amager, together with her two older brothers. Her singing career began at the Copenhagen restaurant Kontoret while she was still a high school pupil at Christianshavns Gymnasium. Shortly before she matriculated from school in 1964, she was introduced to the song writer Th√∏ger Olesen (1923‚Äì1977) who engaged her as a singer at Tivoli's newly opened Vise-Vers- Hus. In 1965, when she was 19, she met the 16-year-old artist Carl Henrik Jensen on the island of Fan√∏. They married, had a daughter, Sille, but divorced seven years later. Career In the 1960s, she collaborated with various singers and songwriters, including Georges Marinos, Frode Veddinge, Jens August Schade and Cornelis Vreeswijk. After her daughter Sille was born in 1964, she included children's songs among her folksongs. Now part of the Copenhagen folk scene of the 1970s, inspired by the Canadian folk singer Joni Mitchell she developed her own style and wrote her own songs. Trille gained immediate success throughout Denmark as both a singer and a feminist on 18 September 1970 after appearing for three minutes on the TV show Musikalske venner where she sang Jesper Jensen's controversial song \\"√òjet\\". Causing something of a national scandal, it tells of how God looked down on forbidden erotic feelings although he knew nothing about sex as he never had any himself. It led to one of Denmark's few court cases relating to blasphemy although both she and Danmarks Radio were freed of any crime a year later as the judge could see nothing provocative in the song. Her 1976 album Hej S√∏ster which expressed her feelings as a mother and a woman reflected the goals of the women's movement, confirming her as a spokesman for their cause. In an interview in 2004, however, she denied any role in the movement: \\"I have never been a member of a social group or a political party. I didn't even participate in the Red Stocking Movement because at the time I was living together with my daughter's father. As I was active in community affairs, something may perhaps have been expected of me. But they associated me with everything the women's movement did and believed, and however much I screamed and yelled, it didn't help a bit.\\" Albums such as En Lille Bunke Krummer (A Little Heap of Crumbs, 1978) and Altid Har Jeg L√¶ngset (I Always Keep On Longing, 1979) served as inspiration for the singers Anne Linnet and Anne Dorte Michelsen. After she had released her last album Hjemlige eventyr (Secret Adventure) in 1988, she suffered from a deep depression which drove her to give up singing once and for all. She returned to Danmarks Radio's children's department where she had played a pioneering role with children's programmes in the 1970s. She produced TV series for children and documentaries about children in the Third World. On the occasion of her 70th birthday in 2015, she published her memoirs: Altid har jeg l√¶ngset: Erindgriner. After suffering from cancer for a short period, Trille died at her home in Lars Tyndskids mark near Pr√¶st√∏ on 17 October 2016, aged 71. In 1980, she had officially changed her name to Trille Bodil Nielsen.

Broken up chips are preferred over stringy drill chips.*Roberts, Arthur D. & Lapidge, Samuel C.: \\"Manufacturing Processes\\" p. 146 McGraw-Hill (1977) ISBN 0-07-053151-X Metal swarf, also known as chips or by other process-specific names (such as turnings, filings, or shavings), are pieces of metal that are the debris or waste resulting from machining or similar subtractive (material- removing) manufacturing processes. Metal swarf can be small particles (such as the gritty swarf from grinding metal) or long, stringy tendrils (such as the springy chips from turning tough metals). Cutting hazards and safety precautions Metal grinding produces grinding swarf. Cuts, splinters, punctures, airborne chips Chips can be extremely sharp, and this creates a safety problem, as they can cause serious injuries if not handled correctly. Depending on the composition of the material, it can persist in the environment for a long time before degrading. This, combined with the small size of some chips (e.g. those of brass or bronze), allows them to disperse widely by piggy-backing on soft materials and also to penetrate the skin as deep splinters. It is standard training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to avoid handling swarf with bare hands. Similarly, it is also standard training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to minimize or entirely avoid handling swarf by blowing chips away with compressed air, but this practice is considered burdensome or impractical by some machinists - the rule of thumb is to reduce the potential hazard by trying to eliminate the problem as far as reasonably practicable. This could simply be done by keeping a clean working environment. Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way wipers and bearing seals. Alternatives to blowing chips away include vacuuming them away with an industrial vacuum (shop vacuum); gently washing them away with a coolant hose discharging at typical garden-hose pressures; or preventing their generation in the first place (for example, forming threads instead of cutting them). It is not uncommon for chips flying off the cutter to be ejected with great force and to fly several metres. These flying chips present a hazard that is deflected with safety glasses, face shields, and other personal protective equipment, as well as the sheet-metal enclosures (and polycarbonate windows) that surround most commercial computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. Flammability Due to its high surface area, swarf composed of some reactive metals can be highly flammable. Caution should be exercised to avoid ignition sources when handling or storing swarf in loose form, especially swarf of pure magnesium, magnesium alloy, pure titanium, titanium alloy, iron, and non-stainless steel. Swarf stored in piles or bins may also spontaneously combust, especially if the swarf is coated with cutting oil. To extinguish swarf fires, a special fire extinguisher is needed, designed for fighting Class D (metal) fires. Toxicity Some common engineering materials such as beryllium are hazardous when finely divided and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent exposure. Chip breaking Optimum cutting efficiencies often generate long spring-like swarf. This is hard to deal with as it is bulky and can clog the nozzle of a shop vac. Clean- up and disposal of this continuous-cutting swarf is made simpler by using a cutting tool with a chip-breaker. This results in denser, more manageable waste. Chip breaking tool geometry is generally designed to break the chip by having it curl back onto itself. This action produces many small spiral shaped rings instead of one long helical chip. \\"Number Nine\\" shaped chips or short swarf in general are preferred also because it helps prevent entangling the rotating machine. Machine cleaning and chip handling Disposing of swarf is a tedious but necessary task. For ease of transport and handling, swarf may be compressed into bricks, which greatly reduces associated problems with storing and cost; it also improves material handling for all concerned with its reclamation and recycling. Recycling Metal swarf can usually be recycled, and this is the preferred method of disposal due to the environmental concerns regarding potential contamination with cutting fluid or tramp oil. The ideal way to remove these liquids is by the use of a centrifuge which will separate the fluids from the metal, allowing both to be reclaimed and prepared for further treatment. Small bundles of stainless steel or bronze swarf are sold as excellent scourers for dishwashing or cleaning encrustations of dirt. Recycling chips rather than putting them in the garbage stream (heading to landfilling or incineration) has various advantages: * Environmental ** As mentioned above, keep cutting fluid out of the waste stream ** Reduce the amount of ore mining and metal refining that must be done to meet the annual global demand for metal stocks. For example, it takes at least 4 times the energy per unit of production to produce aluminum billet from mined ore‚Äîplus the environmental impact of the mining itself‚Äîas it does to produce it from recycled scrap metal stocks (such as chips and bar drops). * Financial ** There is almost always some money to be made from the stream of recycled chips, whether by the scrap processor, the machine shop, or often both. The scrap value (melt value) of the metal is a net gain beyond any costs of handling and transporting the chips. Requirements Machine shops are typically required by the scrap collector to: * segregate metal types (e.g., aluminum chips in separate barrels from steel chips) ** it is usually not required to segregate particular alloys (e.g., to keep 2024 aluminum separate from 6061) * segregate solid chunks (such as bar end drops and scrapped-out parts) from chips (which are finer and are processed on different material handling equipment). * drain and/or centrifuge all cutting fluid and way oil out of the chips.

It was contested by Dundalk and Galway Rovers, and took place across two legs ‚Äì with the first leg being played on 1 January 1981 at Terryland Park in Galway, and the second leg being played on 8 January 1981 at Oriel Park in Dundalk. Both legs finished scoreless and Dundalk subsequently won a penalty shoot-out to win the trophy for a second time. Background The League Cup was the first trophy of the 1980‚Äì81 League of Ireland season. The two sides had met once previously that season in the League in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Dundalk had last won the competition in 1978 ‚Äì their first win in the competition. They reached the final by defeating Home Farm (2‚Äì0), St Patrick's Athletic (2‚Äì0) and Drogheda United (5‚Äì0). Galway Rovers were appearing in their first domestic final, having entered the League of Ireland in 1977‚Äì78. Match Summary The first leg in Galway was marked by an injury to Galway goalkeeper, Tom Lally, in the 52nd minute. Galway elected to continue with the injured player in goals, and Dundalk subsequently failed to seriously challenge him, particularly as they then lost forward Mick Fairclough to injury a minute later. Prior to that, Dundalk had dominated the first half and hit the post through Jerome Clarke just before half-time. But, despite the injury to Lally, they appeared happy to settle for the draw, which made them favourites going into the second leg. The second leg in Oriel Park saw Dundalk dominate again as expected, with the Galway goalmouth being described as \\"resembling a very crowded Eyre Square\\". Goalkeeper Lally, recovered from his injury the week before, had to make a number of saves to keep Dundalk out. His opposite number, Richie Blackmore, meanwhile, had little to do ‚Äì as Galway's players were forced into defending on the edge of their own penalty area. In extra-time Dundalk continued to dominate possession, but could only fashion one chance, which again was saved by Lally. In the subsequent penalty shoot-out Dundalk missed two of their five penalties, while Galway missed two of their first four, leaving Lally to take their final kick to send the shoot-out to sudden-death. His penalty was saved by Blackmore, and Dundalk had won the League of Ireland Cup for the second time. They would go on to win the FAI Cup as well, later that season.

He was also a specialist on insect host detection and flight. Hocking was born in London, and after a B.Sc. from the Imperial College, he worked for some time as an entomologist in the British Indian Army posted in Lucknow during World War II. He joined the University of Alberta in 1946, completing his masters and a Ph.D. (1953) from the Imperial College with a thesis on The intrinsic range and speed of the flight of insects before becoming a faculty member, a position he kept for the rest of his life. He was a keen educator, and made numerous TV and radio programs, apart from helping develop the curriculum of Edmonton schools. He received a Gold Medal of the Entomological Society of Canada in 1973. In a review he wrote that most of the literature on mosquitoes were on Aedes and Culex and that these were unrepresentative of the mosquitoes. He also worked on flight and its efficiency in insects. Hocking also made studies on insects and their associations with the African thorn acacias. He founded a newsletter called Quaestiones Entomologicae. He worked on entomology even during his last days as a cancer patient.

Early life De Paradeda was born in 1871 as Alfred (or Alfredo) H., to a Brazilian woman and probably a Spanish consul and a count from Rio de Janeiro, and had at least one brother. After her father's death her mother remarried, this time to an affluent German doctor who lived in Brazil. Photography of de Paradeda taken in NaplesNeugebauer, Franz Ludwig von. 1908. Hermaphroditismus beim Menschen. Werner Klinkhardt Verlag, 1908, str. 647.  Europe  Between 1899 and 1900, de Paradeda was already a prominent figure of Berlin urning balls.‚ÄûTagebuch einer m√§nnlichen Braut.‚Äù Schwules Museum, 16 May 2010, https://www.schwulesmuseum.de/veranstaltung/tagebuch-einer-maennlichen-braut/. During one of them in 1903 she was met by Magnus Hirschfeld, who described the meeting several times in his writings later.Hirschfeld, Magnus. 1904. Berlins Drittes Geschlecht. Berlin: Verlag von Hermann Seemann Nachfolger. p. 104. He mentioned her wearing a Parisian red silk evening dress, with laces worth more than 2000 franks. De Paradeda frequented the local that Hirschfeld visited and was raising the interest of the local social circles, so Hirschfeld started the conversation with her. De Paradeda was described as a woman of many talents, including piano playing, cooking, and handcrafts such as hat decoration.Hirschfeld M.1914. Die Homosexualit√§t des Mannes und des Weibes. P. 167-168, 685-687. She was also supposed to be a good conversationalist who stoked interest with her stories from Brazil or Paris, dispelling any initial doubt or distrust caused by her height or low voice. Many sources refer to her tall but very slender figure and her elegance in expensive fashion and accessories.  Death circumstances  Shortly after meeting Hirschfeld, de Paradeda travelled to Paris, where she was known as Comtesse de Paradeda, and surrounded herself with material goods, servants and invited people to her refined apartment. Somewhere in Paris she met a 'modest' (as described by Hirschfeld) German teacher named Edgar T√∂pfer, who came there to study French.Magnus Hirschfeld, 1910. Die Transvestiten. P. 189-192. On 28 October 1906 de Paradeda left Paris and moved to Breslau as T√∂pfer's fiancee, meeting his friends and family and renting a new apartment. She was friendly with the landlord, who let her repaint the apartment and remodel it, and was called \\"Aunt Didi\\" by the landlord's daughter. Despite everyday visits from her fiance, de Paradeda was very jealous of him and his friends, who distrusted and questioned her. Their private investigation of de Paradeda's past found her stepfather, recently returned from Brazil to Germany, and that he had a stepson named Alfred, but not a stepdaughter named Alma. De Paradeda threatened T√∂pfer with death in case of breaking the engagement. After finally breaking the engagement, he denounced his ex-fiancee to the police (one insight claims that the denouncement happened only after de Paradeda attempted to break into his apartment). When the commissioner of criminal police arrived at de Paradeda's apartment, the countess remained calm and serious, giving the police officer no reason to intervene. Nevertheless, de Paradeda was distraught by the intervention enough to call her trusted doctor (who was indisposed and sent an assistant). De Paradeda refused the assistant's order to undress and undergo a medical examination. On his insistence, she asked for a moment for herself and disappeared for a moment in another room. After a few minutes she came back, sat down in front of the doctor and, having already announced her readiness to be examined, suddenly fell on the ground and within a minute she was dying in violent convulsions. The commissioner who previously visited the apartment found a stale body and a completely confused physician, who examined the body, revealing it was physically male. The story of a \\"male bride from Breslau\\" was published in newspapers worldwide, including the German language Indiana Trib√ºne in the USA‚ÄûIndiana Trib√ºne.‚Äú Indiana Trib√ºne, Volume 30, Number 116, Indianapolis, Marion County, 8 January 1907 and Poverty Bay Herald in New Zealand.

B. submarinus is Gram + , where there is a thick layer of peptidoglycan in its cell wall. Description Bacillus submarinus is a gram positive, aerobic meaning that it requires oxygen for metabolism. B. submarinus is a sporulating bacteria which is when the cell puts it genetic information in a spore during a cell's dormant phase, rod-shaped, bacterium of the genus Bacillus that is commonly found in the ocean at extreme depths and pressures. As with other members of the genus Bacillus, it can form an endospore a bud that contains genetic information in the chance the bacteria cell dies, later when conditions become more hospitable the bacteria returns, surviving extreme conditions. Habitat This species is commonly found in the ocean waters, primarily in the Atlantic Ocean. Bacillus submarinus is able to live in oceans at a depth of more than 5000 m, withstanding extreme hydrostatic pressure that is above 1.1x10^8 Pa or around 15954 Psi. In contrast, the human femur can only withstand a maximum of 1,700 Psi before shattering. Reproduction Bacillus submarinus divide symmetrically to make two daughter cells, producing a single endospore that can remain viable for decades and is resistant to unfavourable environmental conditions such as ocean acidification. They do not reproduce like eurkaryotic cells by mitosis but, a process known as binary fission. In binary fission the DNA in the prokaryote is not condensed in structures similar to chromosomes, but make a copy of the DNA and the cell divides in half. Uses Tarball on the beach in Moss Landing Beach Bacillus submarinus is proven to decompose oil that is found in the ocean such as after an oil spill. As B. submarinus begins the process of decomposing oil in the ocean they form tarballs. In these tarballs the B. submarinus works with other organisms such as Chromobacterium violaceum and Candida marina to change the chemical structure of the oil by decomposing it and causing the molecules in oil to bond to other materials around organism.

History The confederation was established in April 1950 at a conference in Brussels, held on the initiative of the recently-formed International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). It was the first regional organisation established by the ICFTU, and was a new initiative, as the World Federation of Trade Unions and International Federation of Trade Unions had never set up regional bodies. ERO established its headquarters in Brussels. The organisation aimed to represent European trade unions in all regional matters, but in particular in relation to the expected establishment of a European Community. However, competitor organisations soon emerged. The Committee of the Twenty-One was established in 1952, to liaise with the European Coal and Steel Community, and this was succeeded by the European Trade Union Secretariat (ETUS), representing trade union federations in the European Economic Community nations. In 1968, a Trade Union Committee for the European Free Trade Area (EFTA-TUC) was also established. The ERO became marginalised, and after its general secretary, Walter Schevenels, died in 1966, its affiliates discussed a reorganisation, whereby the ETUS and the EFTA-TUC would affiliate to the ERO, and the ETUS general secretary would become the secretary of the ERO. The proposal was rejected, and instead a plan was drawn up for the ERO to act as a liaison group between the ETUS and EFTA- TUC. There proved little need for an organisation to fill this role, and so in 1969 the ERO was dissolved. In 1973, the European Trade Union Confederation was established, to fill a similar role.

The battery was armed with two BL 6-inch Mk VII guns, which were removed prior to World War II. The battery was recommissioned in 1941 with the installation of two guns of the same type, and these remained in place until the battery's closure in 1946. After its closure, the battery was used as a caravan site. During the late 20th-century, the battery and surrounding area was transformed into a public space by Plymouth City Council. The two gun emplacements and magazine were infilled with earth, and ancillary buildings demolished. The features that remain visible include the concrete aprons of the emplacements and a concrete parapet. Adjacent to Jennycliff Cafe is the battery's former blockhouse.

Rubber trees are tapped to remove the latex that is stored in their trunks. This material can then be mixed with additional ingredients to create rubber. Other natural sources of rubber are obtained from the Sapotaceae and Palaquium trees native to the Malay peninsula, as well as the Mimusops globoosa tree native to Panama.Synthetic rubbers have also been created and are also used to create rubber compounds. In the 1830s, Edwin Chaffee developed a technology similar to the two roll rubber mills that are used in rubber production. His machine included multiple rollers that were used to flatten rubber into thin sheets. Chaffee then created the two roll rubber mill which shears and mixes the rubber by having two rolls rotate in opposite directions, at different speeds. The two roll rubber mill is used in almost every rubber production facility today. Many other inventors created rubber mills with varying degrees of similarity to Chaffee's initial designs. George Watkinson patented a three roll design in 1894 while Harold Denmire patented a four roll design in 1932. Operation To produce the rubber used in tires, hoses, shoes and many other applications, the rubber first has to be created using a two roll rubber mill. A rubber mill consists of two horiziontally opposed stainless steel rolls that rotate in opposite directions, at different speeds. The rolls rotate towards each other, one faster than the other. The distance between the two rolls can also be adjusted by the operator. The opposing rotation directions and different speeds produces a combined shear and compression force on the material being mixed on the mill. With open roll rubber mills, the operator may also be in charge of adding ingredients to the rubber while it is being mixed on the mill. Because chemical reactions are occurring during the process of mixing a rubber compound, the compound often heats up. To help keep the rubber compound cool, often one of the rolls is hollow and can be hooked up to a cooling water line which then allows cool water to flow through the roll, cooling the metal roll and therefore the rubber. While the process of operating a rubber mill sounds simple enough, it is very dangerous and many precautions are added to ensure the safety of the operator. Operators and safety personnel must go through extensive training in order to be certified to operate a rubber mill. Because the two rolls of the mill are rolling inwards, it is easy for an individual‚Äôs hand to get sucked into the mill. This not only crushes the hand, but if the individual quickly removes their hand, it can result in degloving. Safety features include emergency stop bars located 40‚Äù vertically above the rolls, which can be pulled at any time to stop the rolling of the mill. Pressure sensitive body bars are also located at knee height so that the machine can be stopped by the operator tapping the bar with their knee. Protective equipment such as safety glasses are also worn. There is also normally a safety operator, in addition to the main operator that is also trained to use the rubber mill and is trained on what to do in the case of an emergency situation. left Rubber compounding Rubber compounding means incorporating rubber ingredients into a rubber mixture so it is evenly dispersed, then the rubber mixture is called a rubber compound. The mill aids in two main steps of rubber processing - mastication and mixing. Mastication is when the raw polymer is sheared and the broken down to create an easier flow. This allows for better incorporation of materials, which leads to the mixing component, when the other materials for a compound are added. To create a rubber compound on a mill, first a raw polymer, or base polymer, is needed. The polymer can be a number of things, including natural rubber, such as of SMR CV, SMR 20, SMR L or a variety of synthetic rubbers such as nitrile(NBR) , ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), butyl, polycholorprene (CR), Polyisoprene (IR) and others. The raw rubber after being masticated, in which normally for natural rubber, other ingredients needed to be compounded into the raw polymer either on a mixing Banbury Kneader or other rubber mixing machine then pass to two roll mill for dispersion and sheeting out for rubber compound that is suitable for molding dimension. Rubbing compounding also can be mixed on two roll mill by sequentially adding the ingredient and fold, cut and roll the rubber to mix. This process create rubber that can be used to create products. Ingredients added to make a rubber compound include oils, fillers and accelerator, which usually includes sulfur or peroxide, and may also include a metal oxide either as activator such as zinc oxide, in some cases as filler and also as activator. After mixing, a compound is removed from the mill in a large sheet, and then molded into its desired product.

These bibles signalled a significant change in the organization and structure of medieval bibles and were the template upon which the structure of the modern bible is based. Leaf from a Paris Bible. Illustration shows St. Peter writing Up to the beginning of the 13th century there was no single structure for the order of the biblical books, and it was often presented in 4 volumes. The Paris Bible was unique for its time, it was a pandect (complete single volume) with a uniform order, which is similar to the order of the modern Bible used today. Between 1230 and 1280 AD this bible was copied more than frequently and spread more widely across Europe than any other copy of the Bible.  Common characteristics  Paris Bible is the name given to bibles produced by scribes mainly in Paris and areas of Northern France although examples are believed to have originated in England and Italy. However, scholars caution that the term is used too broadly as it is often confused with the ‚Äòpocket bible‚Äô which is applied to bibles produced from the 12th century onwards. These were small enough to be carried in a saddle or travelling bag or indeed a pocket. whilst the Paris Bible often shared this characteristic, the pocket bibles did not conform to the other features commonly present in the Paris Bible which was also produced in larger sizes, which marks it as not interchangeable with the term pocket bible. However, this bible was different to its counterparts as it was often smaller than bibles used previously, making it easier to hold and carry, this led to it also being known as the portable bible. Moreover, being contained in a single volume was an innovation. Scholars apply the term to bibles which possess a number of common characteristics. Each pandect contained the apocryphal books, 64 prologues mostly based on the commentaries of Jerome and an index of the interpretations of Hebrew names (IHN). Whilst the thirteenth century bibles were divided into chapters, they were yet to include numbered verses. Each bible was arranged in the following style: *Octateuch *I-IV Kings *I-II Chronicles *Ezra *Nehemiah *II Ezra *Tobit *Judith *Esther *Job *Psalms *Sapiential Books (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Songs, Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, the Prophets (Isiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel and the minor prophets) *I-II Maccabees *New Testament *Gospels *Pauline Epistles *Acts *Catholic Epistles *Apocalypse Paris Bibles were commercially produced, often with no owner in mind. This set them apart from the traditional breviary‚Äôs and psalters which were usually commissioned by the owner, with a distinct design, including illustrations which reflected their family history and status. Whilst the bibles were still carefully copied and complete with decorated or historiated initials and pen flourishes in coloured ink, they were more aesthetically uniform. However, their portability made them popular with students of theology and monks from the orders of the Dominican and Franciscan monasteries.  Structure and format  Examples of known Paris Bibles have been measured in the range of 50cm x 30 cm to 23cm x 16cm, although the latter is a very rare example. Due to the smaller size of the codex a larger number of leaves was required, between 400-700. This number of leaves is in stark contrast to earlier medieval bibles which usually had no more than 150-200 leaves. In order to compensate for the new thickness scribes needed to reduce the thickness of the parchment used. This was achieved by using calf skin produced north of the Alps which was able to be processed on both sides, whilst retaining its white colouring and quality, which is a signature of most Paris Bibles. It was impossible to detect the hair side from the flesh side on this vellum, making it an ideal parchment for the fine writing required on these smaller bibles. The reduction in thickness of the vellum also required bookbinders to introduce senions (no link need an explanation) rather than quarternions so that leaves did not come loose from the bound spine due to them being so thin. Due to vast number of leaves in these larger codices tracking systems had to be introduced to allow the bookbinder and illustrators to keep track of the leaves in a quire. This featured sequences of letters throughout the quire. Each quire was also individually labelled, often with Roman numerals. A two-column layout is almost always adopted for ‚ÄòParis‚Äô Bibles. The margins, which usually commanded over 40% of the space on a medieval manuscript was reduced to provide more writing space. The length of the text was reduced through the use of common abbreviations, and the font size was reduced, often to 1 millimeter. The text was evenly spaced over 50-60 lines on each page. A further difference introduced in the Paris Bible is the use of common running headers, using alternating red and blue ink to aid readers and chapter numbers. Scholars have disputed the fact that all Paris Bibles were single volume manuscripts as several two volume bibles are still in existence. Several leading Book Historians have suggested that where there is evidence of highly decorated pages mid-way through a one volume bible it is evidence of a two-volume manuscript being rebound at a later date as one volume.  Readers and owners  Bibles produced before 1230 were designed for medieval monks, priests and those members of the laity who were capable of reading Latin. However, they did not engage with its content as a written text, they mainly heard it being proclaimed to them during the Mass. The cycle of the Church and Orders of the differing monasteries had the order of reading designated to them annually, according to the liturgical canon. The founding of a flurry of universities in the thirteenth century can be regarded as one of the major changes which determined how the Bible would change. One of the often-heard comments of the Paris Bible is that it was designed for studying the newly introduced theology which raised questions about the Articles of Faith and the doctrine of the Church.. Mendicant Orders also created schools (studia) which had, at the heart of the education program, an academic study of the scriptures. It was these changes which led to the desire to rearrange the format of the Bible in order that students, masters and preachers could retrieve information effectively. Adding reading aids like running headers and chapter numbers allowed readers to find the Books of the Bible and essential text.

It succeeded the first Zapatero government and was the Government of Spain from 14 April 2008 to 22 December 2011, a total of days, or . Zapatero's second cabinet was composed mainly by members of the PSOE and its sister party, the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC), as well as a number of independents. It was automatically dismissed on 21 November 2011 as a consequence of the 2011 general election, but remained in acting capacity until the next government was sworn in.

Bermejo came under fire from PP leaders, who accused him of interfering within the investigations. While he denied such claims, he submitted his resignation due to the growing political pressure on him. He was succeeded by Francisco Caama√±o. *On 7 April 2009, the cabinet saw an extensive reshuffle. Pedro Solbes stepped down as Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance and was replaced by Elena Salgado, who in turn stepped down as Minister of Public Administrations. President of Andalusia Manuel Chaves was appointed as Third Deputy Prime Minister and new Minister of Territorial Policy. Jos√© Blanco replaced Magdalena √Ålvarez as Minister of Development; √Ångel Gabilondo replaced Mercedes Cabrera in Education; √Ångeles Gonz√°lez-Sinde replaced C√©sar Antonio Molina in Culture and Trinidad Jim√©nez replaced Bernat Soria as Minister of Health. *On 21 October 2010, Celestino Corbacho stepped down as Minister of Labour and Immigration in order to run within the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC)'s list for the 2010 Catalan regional election, being replaced by Valeriano G√≥mez. Zapatero took this opportunity to undertake a major cabinet reshuffle which saw Mar√≠a Teresa Fern√°ndez de la Vega being replaced as First Deputy Prime Minister and Spokesperson of the Government by Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba‚Äîwho retained his office as Minister of the Interior‚Äîand as Minister of the Presidency by Ram√≥n J√°uregui. Trinidad Jim√©nez replaced Miguel √Ångel Moratinos as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation; Rosa Aguilar replaced Elena Espinosa as Minister of Environment, Rural and Marine Affairs and Leire Paj√≠n was appointed to the Health ministry. The ministries of Housing and Equality were restructured into state secretariats within the Development and Health ministries, respectively. Finally, Chaves's Territorial Policy portfolio was restructured into the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Public Administration. *On 12 July 2011, Rubalcaba stepped down from the government after having been nominated as the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE)'s leading candidate for the 2011 general election. Subsequently, a final reshuffle took place, with changes limited to fill the vacancies: Antonio Camacho was appointed in Interior, Jos√© Blanco replaced Rubalcaba as the Government's spokesperson and the offices of the deputy prime ministers under Elena Salgado and Manuel Chaves were restructured. Council of Ministers The Council of Ministers was structured into the offices for the prime minister, the two deputy prime ministers, 17 ministries and the post of the spokesperson of the Government. From April 2009, the Council would include a third deputy prime minister. The number of ministries was reduced to 15 after the ministries of Housing and Equality were merged into the Development and Health ministries. From July 2011, the Council would include only two deputy prime ministers. {  style=\\"font-size:97%;\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#F2F2F2\\" align=\\"center\\" ‚Üê Zapatero II Government ‚Üí (14 April 2008 ‚Äì 22 December 2011) - !

It succeeded the second Zapatero government and was the Government of Spain from 22 December 2011 to 4 November 2016, a total of days, or . Rajoy's first cabinet was composed mainly by members of the PP, as well as a number of independents.

He was succeeded by Isabel Garc√≠a Tejerina. *On 23 September 2014, Alberto Ruiz-Gallard√≥n resigned as Minister of Justice, after the government chose to withdraw his proposed abortion bill. The decision was said to come over the loss of personal prestige resulting from a staunch defense of the bill, with Rajoy's u-turn on the issue being seen as a personal disavowal of Gallard√≥n. Soraya S√°enz de Santamar√≠a was tasked with the ordinary discharge of duties of the Ministry for Justice until Gallardon's successor, Rafael Catal√°, could take office on 29 September 2014. *On 26 November 2014, Ana Mato resigned as Minister of Health, Social Services and Equality due to her involvement in the G√ºrtel case, after she was summoned to court as a \\"participant on a lucrative basis\\" in the corruption crimes allegedly committed by former husband Jes√∫s Sep√∫lveda. Her resignation came one day before a plenary in Congress on corruption in which Prime Minister Rajoy was scheduled to intervene, and after Mato herself had announced earlier that day that she had not considered her resignation. S√°enz de Santamar√≠a took on the ordinary discharge of duties of the ministry until Mato's successor, Alfonso Alonso, could take office on 3 December 2014. *On 26 June 2015, √ç√±igo M√©ndez de Vigo replaced Jos√© Ignacio Wert as Minister of Education, Culture and Sports, after the latter had expressed his wish to retire from politics. From 21 December 2015, Rajoy's cabinet took on acting duties for the duration of the government formation process resulting from the 2015 general election. This lasted for days and saw a new general election being held in the meantime. A number of ministers renounced their posts throughout this period, with the ordinary discharge of duties of their ministries being transferred to other cabinet members as a result of Rajoy being unable to appoint replacements while in acting role. *On 15 April 2016, Jos√© Manuel Soria was forced to renounce his post as acting Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism over his involvement in the Panama Papers scandal, owing to the leaking of information revealing that he and his family had maintained several offshore societies on tax havens during the previous decades, as well as his confusing and changing explanations on the issue. Luis de Guindos, acting Minister of Economy and Competitiveness, took on the ordinary discharge of duties of Soria's vacant ministry. *On 19 July 2016, Ana Pastor was elected President of the Congress of Deputies of the XII Legislature, a position incompatible with her post as acting Minister of Development. Rafael Catal√°, acting Minister of Justice, took on the ordinary discharge of duties of Pastor's vacant ministry. *On 16 August 2016, Alfonso Alonso renounced his position as acting Minister of Health, Social Services and Equality in order to run as the PP candidate for Lehendakari in the 2016 Basque regional election. F√°tima B√°√±ez, acting Minister of Employment and Social Security, took on the ordinary discharge of duties of Alonso's vacant ministry.
