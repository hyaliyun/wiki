The slogan was coined by the ex INC president, Rahul Gandhi, against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) affiliated sitting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after raising allegations of favouritism and price escalation in the Dassault Rafale deal. The slogan was coined with the intention of conveying that the person who was entrusted with safeguarding public money (i.e. the watchman) was in fact a thief; context being that PM Modi had in past claimed to be a \\"chowkidar\\" of the nation. ==Background== Narendra Modi has often referred to himself as a \\"chowkidar\\" (watchman) inferring that he would not allow any corruption in the country. While campaigning for the 2014 Indian general election, Modi in his speeches had promised that he would serve the country, not as a Prime Minister, but as a watchman. Modi further added that as a watchman he would never allow anyone to put their paws on the public money. Rahul Gandhi had referred to Modi as chowkidar during his campaign for the 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election. == Slogan == The slogan \\"Chowkidar Chor Hai\\" was coined by Gandhi as a jibe against Modi while campaigning for 2018 Rajasthan Legislative Assembly election. The Hindi slogan translates to \\"The watchman is a thief.\\" It was aimed at Modi in relation to the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding of the contracts related to the Rafale fighter jet deal. On 14 December, Gandhi stated that Chowkidar chor hai and his party will prove the corruption that was done in the Rafale deal. The government has denied any wrong doing in the Rafale deal and also Supreme court dismissed all the petitions seeking a review of its December 2018 judgement and upheld the Rafale deal, stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found. Gandhi in one of his rallies compared it with BJP's 2014 Indian general election slogan \\"Achhe din aane waale hain\\" by stating slogan \\"Achhe din aayenge\\" has now changed to \\"Chowkidar chor hai\\". Later in Nagpur, Gandhi stated that an enquiry will be done after the election post which, \\"the Chowkidar will go to jail\\". On 20 November Gandhi commented that a crime thriller titled \\"Chowkidar hi chor hai\\" is being played out in Delhi and in its most recent episode, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Deputy inspector general of police, Manoj Sinha had made allegations of corruption against senior government officials in his affidavit to the Supreme Court, meanwhile his \\"partner from Gujarat\\" was amassing enormous wealth. Sinha had stated that government officials and ministers were interfering in the investigation against CBI special director Rakesh Asthana. On 18 November 2018, during a BJP election rally in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, responding to the repeated chowkidar chor hai slogan against him, Modi stated that the \\"Naamdaar\\" (dynast) and the Congress party were hurling abuses at him. On 24 December 2018, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray while addressing a rally in Maharashtra state's Pandharpur town, repeated the slogan \\"Chowkidar chor hai\\". He elaborated the slogan with a story about a farmer whose Neem plants were attacked by the pests. This was unusual because Neem tree extracts are traditionally used in India for repelling the pests. Thackeray then stated that \\"this is what is happening everywhere and even those, tasked with protection, are stealing these days.\\" On 25 March, the slogan Chowkidar chor hai was raised by the audience during the fourth cricket match of IPL 2019 at Jaipur. ===Main Bhi Chowkidar=== On 14 March 2019, Modi responded to the jibe by launching a campaign with the slogan \\"Main Bhi Chowkidar\\" () for his supporters, implying that everyone is a fighter against corruption and social evils. Modi even changed the name of his official Twitter handle titled 'Narendra Modi' to 'Chowkidar Narendra Modi'. In a coordinated campaign, ministers, party president Amit Shah and other BJP leaders such as Piyush Goyal changed their Twitter profile names by adding a prefix \\"Chowkidar\\". Many supporters of BJP also changed their names accordingly. Modi addressed a large group of watchmen on audio link as part of the campaign. Congress party criticized BJP's election slogan with Gandhi stating that the truth cannot change since Chowkidar Chor Hai. The chief spokesperson of Congress, Randeep Surjewala responded to Modi's slogan and accused Modi of being the \\"only chowkidar who is a thief\\". Congress social media team responded with the slogan \\"Main Bhi Berozgar\\" (I too am jobless) to highlight the problem of unemployment under the Modi government and to counter Main Bhi Chowkidar campaign. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal stated that Modi wants the entire country to become 'chowkidar' , people who want their children to become watchmen should vote for Modi while those looking for good education for the children to become doctor, engineer or lawyer should vote for AAP. === Supreme Court case=== BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi filed a case in the Supreme Court of India seeking a contempt action against Gandhi for misattributing his remarks to the top court.The Court sought an apology from Gandhi. On 22 April 2019, Gandhi filed his response to the Supreme Court's notice on his comments on the sub-judice case of the Rafale fighter jet deal, saying he had attributed the chowkidar chor hai remarks to the supreme court \\"in the heat of the campaign\\". In his reply, Gandhi said he got carried away while campaigning and \\"unfortunately\\", the media \\"mingled\\" his words. He expressed regret for dragging the top court's name into the comments he made a week ago and also admitted that the Supreme Court had never used the phrase chowkidar chor hai, which he reiterates at every campaign rally accusing Modi of stealing from the poor and handing doles to the rich. Later he apologised,\\" after the Court expressed displeasure on a \\"regret\\", instead of \\"apology\\" as was sought earlier. ==See also== * Main Bhi Chowkidar * Who watches the watchmen, a Latin phrase found in the work of the Roman poet Juvenal == References == ==Further reading== *\\"Chowkidar\\" Shows Rahul May Just Have Outwitted Modi Category:Indian political slogans Category:Indian general election campaigns Category:2019 Indian general election Category:Indian National Congress campaigns Category:Narendra Modi Category:Rahul Gandhi ","title":"Chowkidar Chor Hai"},{"id":"60261997","text":"Lebyazhye () is a rural locality (a selo) in Obrastsovo-Travinsky Selsoviet, Kamyzyaksky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

Kelly (styled as #MuteRKelly) is a movement to have R. Kelly convicted of sexual abuse and to end financial support for his career. The campaign was founded by Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye in July 2017, when Odeleye was informed Kelly was booked to perform at the Fulton County owned facility in Atlanta. Oronike stated, \\"Someone had to stand up for Black women, and if I wasn't willing to do my part — no matter how small — then I couldn't continue to complain. It's time for us to end this man's career. Enough is beyond enough.\\" ==Founding == The co-founder of the movement in 2017, Oronike Odeleye, described the campaign: \\"#MuteRKelly continues until the Black community has fully financially divested from the man and his music and we tackle the overwhelming issue of sexual abuse\\". Odeleye is an African American Atlanta-based Arts Administrator and alongside her, Kenyette Barnes, activist and lobbyist, also sought to lobby elected officials, mobilize activists around the world encourage users of music streaming platforms to #ThumbItDown, when R. Kelly's music plays, in order to change the algorithm of his songs until they stop playing. In addition, there are 12 chapters around the world including, #RKellyStummschalten in Germany and #MuteRKelly Amsterdam. ==Allegations== Over two decades R. Kelly has faced allegations of sexual abuse of minors, including marrying a 15-year-old girl (which was found to be factual), R&B; singer Aaliyah, by listing her age as 18 on the marriage certificate that had falsified documents which supported the false age. The singer has also been sued and accused of supposed sex with an underage girl. On one count it is apparent Kelly videotaped one of these encounters. The singer then went on to face more charges of underage sex charges, child pornography charges and sex cult claims. The singer denies all of these allegations. ==Impact== ===Protests=== The Mute R. Kelly movement impact sparked many actions after being founded. The movement has seen a number of public protests in Chicago, Atlanta, Memphis, New York City, North Carolina, and more. Despite the protests, in some cities Kelly still performed. However, Kelly's scheduled performance was cancelled at the \\"Pre-Mother's Day Love Jam\\" at The University of Illinois at Chicago on May 5, 2018. A women's group at the university created a petition which secured 1300 signatures. Kelly then posted a video on Twitter stating \\"First of all, I want to apologize to all of my fans in Chicago, and basically all around the world wherever I'm performing at and they cancelled me,\\" He then went on to say, \\" I don't know why they canceled the show. I never heard of a show being cancelled because of rumors, but I guess there's a first time for everything. So I apologize to you guys and in the meantime, I'm going to try to get to the bottom line of it, you know, as far as my lawyers are concerned, and see exactly what happened and why I was cancelled.\\" ===Celebrity attention=== The movement has sparked some celebrity attention. Some of R. Kelly's music collaborations received backlash and have been removed from streaming services as the Surviving R. Kelly documentary series aired on Lifetime in January 2019 and the #MuteRKelly movement has grown. Artists such as Lady Gaga, Celine Dion and The Pussycat Dolls have apologised and taken down their music on streaming services. However R. Kelly throughout his decades of sexual abuse allegations against young women, has managed work with Bryson Tiller, Chance the Rapper, Justin Bieber, Erykah Badu and Mary J. Blige. The Time's Up movement released an open letter calling out Apple, Spotify, Ticketmaster, Sony and other companies to end their financial relationship with R. Kelly. The campaign has been cited and addressed online by influential celebrities including Ava DuVernay, Lena Waithe, Lupita Nyong'o and Tarana Burke. == See also == * Bill Cosby sexual assault cases * Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases * \\"I Admit\\" (R.

She was born in the village of Naya in the family of Dukhushyam Chitrakar, a renowned patua artist himself. As a child she used to accompany her grandfather as he went looking for patrons and clients in the villages, and so was exposed to the art-form from a very young age. In an interview from 2005, Manimala elaborated on how the art form has significantly influenced her life: > \\"If I hadn't learned this craft I could not have gone to the United States. > I tell all of the young people of Naya to learn this skill if they want to > travel and earn a living. My abilities have allowed me to develop a broader > sense of the world - my life has not been restricted to the confines of > Naya.\\" She is a mother of six children and continues to live in her ancestral village. ==Style== Earlier works of Manimala deal primarily with mythological themes, but have an inherent rawness in the handling of the subjects. The wrath of gods against illicit sexual unions, men and women in various stages of nakedness as they are subjected to hell's torturous routines, fearsome demons and large slithering snakes crowd her canvas. Over time, her artistic oeuvre expanded to include more colors, iconographic variations and themes. From pressing social issues of the world at large to belief systems that hold her social fabric together - she has explored a large variety of subject matter in a career spanning more than a decade. ==Exhibitions and collections== * Vernacular in the Contemporary Part I, Devi Art Foundation, Gurgaon, 2011. * Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Art Mela, 2016 * The 8th Asia- Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, 2016 *Queensland Arts Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane, Australia ==References== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century artists Category:Indian women artists Category:People from West Bengal Category:Religious artists ","title":"Manimala Chitrakar"},{"id":"60262202","text":"Local elections were held in Calamba City on May 13, 2019, within the Philippine general election, for posts of the mayor, vice mayor and twelve councilors.

He also recorded extensively on the Victor label. ==Life and career== Hamlin was born in Elgin Illinois to Mary (née Hart) and John Austin Hamlin. His father was a former magician who had made his fortune from Hamlin's Wizard Oil, a patent medicine sold as a cure-all under the slogan \\"There is no sore it will not heal, no pain it will not subdue.\\" Shortly after Hamlin's birth, the family relocated to Chicago where his father went into the theatre business. He bought the site of Hooley's Opera House which had been destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 and built and managed what was then called the Chicago Grand Opera House. He eventually handed over its management to George's elder brothers Harry L. and Frederick R. Hamlin. George Hamlin was educated at Phillips Academy where he graduated in 1889 and studied singing in London with George Henschel. He made his debut in 1895 as the tenor soloist in Mendelssohn's Lobgesang performed by the St. Louis Choral Symphony Society. Over the next 16 years he performed widely in the US and Europe in solo vocal recitals and oratorios, including annual recitals in Chicago and New York City, and is credited with having introduced the art songs of Richard Strauss to American audiences. Towards the end of this period he also became a recording artist for Victor Records. Although Hamlin had earlier sung in concert performances of operas such as Samson and Delilah, he did not appear in staged opera until he joined the Philadelphia-Chicago Grand Opera Company in its 1911/1912 season. His friend Victor Herbert had written the leading tenor role (Lt. Paul Merrill) in his new opera Natoma for Hamlin's voice. Hamlin ultimately backed out of the world premiere in Philadelphia in February 1911, and it was sung by John McCormack instead. However, the following December Hamlin sang the role in Chicago and appeared in it nine more times. One of the Philadelphia critics wrote of his February 1912 performance there: > Mr. Hamlin's voice has much to commend it in the way of smoothness and > sympathy, and he sings with taste and skill, while he also carried himself > well, put real feeling into his acting, and altogether made a highly > favorable impression. Hamlin continued his performances in recital and oratorio but sang further leading tenor roles with the Philadelphia-Chicago company through 1917 both in Chicago and on the company's US tours. These included Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly, Gennaro in Jewels of the Madonna, Edward Plummer in Goldmark's Das Heimchen am Herd (performed in English as The Cricket on the Hearth), Don José in Carmen, Cavaradossi in Tosca, Florindo in Parelli's I dispettosi amanti, François in Madeleine, and Walter in Bucharoff's The Lover's Knot at its world premiere in 1916. In the later years of his career Hamlin also taught singing privately at his home on Madison Avenue in New York City, and at his summer home in Lake Placid, New York. In late October 1922 Frank Damrosch announced that Hamlin would be joining the faculty at the New York Institute of Musical Art in the coming year. However, earlier that month a sudden illness had caused Hamlin to cancel his performance of the Brahms Liebeslieder at the Berkshire Festival. His health continued to decline and he died at his New York City home on 20 January 1923 at the age of 53. He was survived by his wife Harriet Eldridge Hamlin whom he had married in 1892 and their three children, John, George, and Anna. Hamlin's daughter Anna (1900-1988) also became a singer after studying under Marcella Sembrich and in Italy. She performed in recitals and sang minor soprano roles with Chicago Civic Opera and later was a voice teacher at Smith College from 1939 to 1959. After her retirement she moved to New York City where she established a private vocal studio. Her students there included Judith Raskin, Claudia Lindsey, and Edna Garabedian. In 1978 she published her memoirs entitled Father Was A Tenor. The George and Anna Hamlin papers dating from 1868 to 1983 are held in the New York Public Library as is a lengthy recorded interview of Anna Hamlin conducted by the broadcaster Fred Calland in 1972. The interview alternates between reminiscences of her father and the playing of several of his recordings with detailed analysis and commentary by Calland. ==References== ==Further reading== *The Musical Critic (June 1898) pp. 4, 8, 9 (contains descriptions and reviews of several concert and oratorio performances by Hamlin) ==External links== *8 remastered audio files recorded by Hamlin for Victor Records on archive.org.

One of the injured died of his injuries ten days later. A 37-year-old Turkish man was arrested later that day following a major security operation and manhunt. He was later convicted of murder with terrorist intent and sentenced to life in prison.\\"Utrecht tram shooting suspect confesses, claims he acted alone\\". Deutsche Welle, 22 March 2019. Retrieved 23 March 2019. == Attack == At about 10:45 CET (09:45 UTC), a shooting took place on a fast tram near the 24 Oktoberplein junction in Utrecht. The shooter fled in a car, leading to a large scale police manhunt, which lasted for much of the day. Several hours later, the police arrested Gökmen Tanis, a 37-year-old man born in Turkey. In addition, two further arrests were made in connection to the shooting. Police impounded a red Renault Clio in connection with the attack. Initially, it was reported that one of the women shot may have been the target due to \\"family reasons\\" and other passengers coming to her aid were then also targeted. However, law enforcement later announced there was no evidence of any connection between Tanis and the victims. Instead, a note found in the getaway car hinted at terrorism being the motive. ==Victims== Three people were killed and seven others were injured, three severely. The injured were taken to the University Medical Center Utrecht. The three people killed were identified as two men from Utrecht aged 49 and 28, and a 19-year-old woman from the nearby city of Vianen. A neighbour of the murdered 19-year-old started a crowd- funding action to cover the costs of her funeral, reaching the target within hours. It received so many donations that it was turned into a fund for all of the victims of the attack. A 74-year-old man injured in the shooting died of his injuries on 28 March, bringing the death toll to four. ==Suspect== Tanis was arrested after a manhunt on the day of the attack. Tanis grew up in Turkey and came to the Netherlands in 1993 with his parents and two brothers. His parents divorced in 2008 and since then he has lost contact with his father. Until 2017, he lived mainly with his mother. In the Utrecht neighborhood Kanaleneiland Tanis is known for its hair color as 'De Rode Turk' or 'Lokman'. As of 2011, Tanis has been intermittently addicted to hard drugs. According to his family and local residents, he was very aggressive when he used drugs, and, apart from his interactions with other drug users, he was almost always seen alone. In the periods between his addictions he focused more on his Islamic faith. en-religious.html 'Gökmen T. as an addict aggressive, quieter and religiously kicked off'  NOS NOS.nl, March 21, 2019 At the time of his arrest, Tanis was about to be evicted from a rent arrears, and he also had outstanding fines. He lived alone at the time, but was engaged and had wedding plans.Verdachte Gökmen T. had schulden en zou woning kwijtraken RTL Nieuws, 21 maart 2019 On 22 March 2019, Tanis confessed to being the sole perpetrator of the shooting. Another suspect was arrested but then released. A letter found in the hijacked car the suspect fled in suggested terrorist motivations; some witnesses claimed they heard the suspect say \\"Allahu akbar\\". The public prosecutor charged the suspect with three counts of murder with a terrorist motive. Two weeks before the attack, Tanis was on trial for a sexual offence committed in 2017. On 1 July 2019, the contents of the found letter were made public. The letter read: \\"I am doing this for my religion. You guys are killing Muslims and want to take my religion away from me. You will not succeed in that. Allah is great.\\" On 20 March 2020, Tanis was sentenced to life in prison. ==Aftermath== After the attack, the threat level in the province of Utrecht was unprecedentedly raised to level 5, the highest level. After the suspect was caught, it was reduced to Level 4. Police presence was increased at railway stations, including Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, and at the country's airports. Tram services in the city were cancelled. Elite police forces carrying semi-automatic weapons guarded Jewish community buildings. Mosques in the city were evacuated, and those elsewhere in the country were given increased security, likely due to the recent mosque shootings in New Zealand. The day after the shooting, all national flags on government buildings in the Netherlands and at Dutch diplomatic posts were flown at half-mast on request of Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Dutch royal residences flew a black banner, symbolising mourning, alongside the customary royal standard. In addition, election debates and political campaigning for the provincial elections on 20 March 2019 were suspended by all political parties, except for a Forum for Democracy party meeting.

Living near Keswick all his life, he contributed to local cultural life, and published poetry, some in the local dialect. ==Life== He was born at Stone House in Naddle Vale, near Keswick, Cumberland, in 1817, one of seven children of Daniel Richardson and his wife Mary née Faulder, who were natives of the Vale. He was educated under the Reverend Edward Wilson, who taught the school of St John's in the Vale and was incumbent of its little church.\\"John Richardson\\" St John's Castlerigg and Wythburn Parish History. Retrieved 18 March 2019. On leaving school Richardson followed his father's trade as a mason, and eventually as a builder. He rebuilt the church of St John's in the Vale, the parsonage, and the schoolhouse. About 1857 he became master of the school, where he taught until partially disabled by a paralytic seizure about a year before his death. He died on the fell side, near his residence, Bridge House, on 30 April 1886, and was buried at the church of St John's in the Vale on 4 May. Aged 24 he married Grace Birkett, who, with eight of their family of ten children, survived him. ==Writings== Many of his writings, which are numerous, both in prose and verse, are in the vernacular of the district of Cumberland in which he had spent his life. He published Cummerland Talk: Being Short Tales And Rhymes In The Dialect of That County, Together With A Few Miscellaneous Pieces In Verse (volume 1 1871, volume 2 1876). Richardson read seven papers to the Keswick Literary Society, which were printed in the Transactions of the Cumberland Association for the Advancement of Literature and Science. In 1879 and 1880 he contributed to the West Cumberland Times a series of sketches, \\"Stwories 'at Granny used to tell\\". He also contributed to various newspapers pieces of poetry and prose, some of them in the Cumberland dialect. Most of his compositions are characterised by humour and pathos. As a poet and songwriter he had a great local reputation, and his literary work often proved of conspicuous merit. ==References== Attribution * Category:1817 births Category:1886 deaths Category:19th-century English poets Category:People from Keswick, Cumbria ","title":"John Richardson (poet)"},{"id":"60262318","text":"Arenibacter antarcticus is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic and rod-shaped bacterium from the genus of Arenibacter which has been isolated from sediments the Ross Sea. == References == Category:Flavobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2017 ","title":"Arenibacter antarcticus"},{"id":"60262322","text":"Spencer Dam was a run of the river hydroelectric dam on the Niobrara River in Boyd County and Holt County, Nebraska, about southeast of Spencer. The dam was operated by the Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD). Heavy precipitation during the March 2019 North American blizzard led to a failure of the dam in the early morning of 14 March, causing heavy flooding downstream.NWSMBRFC tweet on 14 March 2019 with map of the flooding downriver to the Missouri River upon failure, by National Weather Service Missouri Basin River Forecast Center ==History== Initial construction was completed in 1927, at a site located upstream of the Niobrara's confluence with the Missouri River. The dam was originally long and high, constructed in several sections. The powerhouse was located on the north bank of the river, consisting of two Westinghouse generators with capacities of 2000 and 1300 kilowatts. The spillway consisted of four tainter gates and five stoplog gates to the south of the powerhouse. The combined length of the powerhouse and spillway was ; the rest of the dam was an earth embankment extending to the south side of the Niobrara valley. The dam originally formed a reservoir with a capacity of , a normal storage of , and a surface area of . In 1935 the dam was partially breached after an ice jam broke upstream. It was reconstructed in 1940. Both after its initial construction and after rebuilding in 1940, the dam was filled with sediment within a few years. Although this did not affect hydropower generation since the dam was operated to match the river flow, twice-annual sluicing had been conducted since 1948 to clear sediment away from the power intakes. The dam gates were opened for about two weeks each year, allowing the river to flow through and wash accumulated sediment downstream. Between 1975 and 1989, fish kills occurred in the Niobrara River that were attributed to sluicing activities. In response, engineers began draining the reservoir more slowly, which has worked in preventing further fish kills. By 1985, Spencer Dam was the only active hydroelectric plant on the Niobrara River, after the upstream Cornell Dam ceased operation. The NPPD had rights to of water per year for power generation. As of 2007, the average annual flow through the power plant was . In 2007, in regards to severe declines in the flow of the Niobrara River as a result of upstream irrigation, NPPD requested that the state of Nebraska make farmers pay as compensation for lost power generation. Several lawsuits were filed as a result, but as of May 2010 all had been decided in favor of NPPD, whose water rights are senior to the irrigators' rights. In September 2015, NPPD announced that it would be decommissioning the Spencer hydropower plant in 2017 due to increasingly uneconomical cost of power generation at this site. The water rights would be sold for $9 million to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and five local natural resources districts to manage the river for agriculture, recreation and wildlife conservation. The dam was planned to remain in place with the gates permanently removed, allowing the river to flow freely through the site. ==2019 failure== On the early morning of March 14, 2019, the dam was breached after a major storm caused heavy rain, snowmelt and ice breakage to swell the Niobrara River. The earth embankment was washed out in two locations, while the spillway remained partially intact (though heavily damaged). A wall of water was released by the failure, as recorded by a U.S. Geological Survey stream gage moments before it was washed away. The initial break destroyed a saloon and private residence below the dam and washed out part of U.S. Highway 281. The owner of the home was reported missing and presumed dead. In the town of Niobrara, dozens of buildings and the Mormon Canal Bridge carrying Nebraska Highway 12 were washed away. A water pipeline under the Niobrara River bed was destroyed, cutting off the supply for about 2,000 people in Boyd County. The dam failure forced the evacuation of residents in low lying areas along the river. Shortly after the dam burst, Knox County Sheriff Don Henery announced: \\"The Knox County Sheriff’s Office has been advised that the Spencer Dam has been compromised. We are trying to contact everyone along the Niobrara River to evacuate them. Please pass the word. Niobrara and Verdigre (Nebraska) Fire and Rescue are on stand-by.\\" As the floodwaters from the Niobrara reached the Missouri River, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers boosted releases at Gavins Point Dam to , the highest level since 2011 and the second highest on record. While the timing of Spencer Dam failing corresponds to increased releases from Gavins Point, correlation does not mean causation. Both were a result from record flows on the Niobrara River. The Chief Standing Bear Memorial Bridge across the Missouri River below the Niobrara confluence was temporarily closed as the Nebraska approach flooded, but it reopened a few days later. NPPD later said that workers had attempted to open the dam's manually operated gates to release floodwater, but some were frozen shut by the cold weather and may have contributed to water overtopping the earthen embankment a short while later. In addition \\"truck- sized ice chunks\\" were reported to have hit the dam and also caused the destruction of the bridges downstream. During an inspection in April 2018 the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources had warned that \\"deficiencies [in the dam] exist which could lead to dam failure during rare, extreme storm events.\\" Because the 2015 sale of the dam had been delayed until after its destruction, the damsite will no longer be sold to the state of Nebraska as originally planned. The remains of the dam are planned to be demolished, although NPPD will retain the water rights to the river. ==References== ==External links== *March 16th 2019 video footage of area surrounding Spencer Dam, tweeted by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts Category:Buildings and structures in Nebraska Category:Dams in Nebraska Category:Geography of Boyd County, Nebraska Category:Dam failures in the United States ","title":"Spencer Dam"},{"id":"60262343","text":"Arenibacter catalasegens is a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped and non- motile bacterium from the genus of Arenibacter which has been isolated from surface sediments from the Southern Indian Ocean. == References == Category:Flavobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2018 ","title":"Arenibacter catalasegens"},{"id":"60262348","text":"Laia Jufresa (born 1983) is a Mexican writer.

One of the more infamous gangs of the early 18th century, they extended their influence from Hawkhurst, their base in Kent, along the South coast, to Dorset. ==Attack on the Custom House at Poole== A native of Goudhurst in Kent and the son of George Kingsmill and Sarah née Renalds, Thomas Kingsmill was baptised on 22 January 1721 at St. Mary's church in Goudhurst. \\"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:N1ZS-BSM : 30 December 2014, Thomas Kingsmill,); citing Goudhurst, Kent, England, index based upon data collected by the Genealogical Society of Utah, Salt Lake City; FHL microfilm 1,736,722. Kingsmill reputedly had his first encounter with the Hawkhurst Gang when as a boy he looked after their horses during one of their smuggling actions. He passed some part of his life as a husbandman before joining the Hawkhurst Gang when he \\"made no scruple of entering into the most hazardous enterprises, and became so distinguished for his courageous -- or rather ferocious -- disposition that he was chosen captain of the gang.\\"Thomas Kingsmill, Fairall and Perin - Three of the thirty Smugglers who broke open the Custom-House at Poole, and were executed at Tyburn, 26th of April, 1749 - British Executions database In October 1747 members of the gang led a successful raid against a government Custom House in Poole, which was holding about thirty hundredweight (3,360 lbs) of tea, thirty-nine casks of brandy and rum, and a small bag of coffee captured from the smugglers' ship Three-Brothers in September. The shipment from Guernsey, worth about £500, had been organised by the Hawkhurst Gang working with a group from east Hampshire and was intended to be landed at Christchurch Bay, but was captured by a revenue vessel Swift commanded by Captain William Johnson on 22 September 1747. The goods were then taken to Poole, after the crew had escaped in a small boat. At a meeting in Charlton Forest Richard Perrin from Chichester, who had gone to Guernsey to buy the goods, made an agreement with the local men to recover the contraband. Thirty armed men, including Thomas Kingsmill and about seven other Hawkhurst men, rode to Poole, stopping to rest in the New Forest. Arriving in Poole, at about 11 pm, they found that the customs house was under the guns of a naval sloop. The more local men were for abandoning the attempt, but the Hawkhurst men said they would continue alone, and it was then agreed that they would all continue. It was soon realised that as the tide fell the ship's guns would no longer be in sight of the customs house. The gang broke into the customs house around 2 am on 8 October, escaping on horseback with the tea. They left the brandy, rum and coffee at the customs house, presumably due to insufficient transport. The smugglers were not opposed at any stage of the journey. The Customs Service offered a large reward of £500 for their capture. After the capture of Arthur Gray in 1747 Kingsmill became the leader of the Hawkhurst Gang. ==The Battle of Goudhurst (1747)== Battle of Goudhurst took place around St. Mary's church in Goudhurst in 1749 When he heard that a Militia had been formed at Goudhurst under \\"General\\" William Sturt (1718-1797), actually a former army corporal,William Sturt (1718-1797) - The Goudhurst & Kilndown Local History Society against the activities of the Gang Kingsmill became enraged by this act of defiance and threatened to burn the village and kill the residents unless the Militia was disbanded and Sturt handed over to the smugglers, setting an appointed time, 21 April 1747. Kingsmill's demands not being met, when the gang attacked on the appointed day during the Battle of Goudhurst they approached heavily armed with many stripped to the waist to display their scars and tattoos in an act of bravado and intimidation.Smuggling in Georgian England: The Hawkhurst Gang - History Revealed: Prisoners of Eternity The Militia held their ground and were well enough trained to shoot dead Kingsmill's brother George in the first volley of a battle fought around St. Mary's church.

The list was published in the London Gazette along with a request for information leading to the arrest of the smugglers.

In 2015, one of her paintings was gifted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Mayor of Hanover, Stefan Schosstok on his visit to India. == Style == Over the past five decades, Madhubani art has grown in prominence and Baua Devi's work has won critical acclaim—she was the only woman artist from India to show at the Magiciens de la Terre in 1989 at the Centre Pompidou. Her work ranges in scale from a small sheet of paper to murals up to 20 feet high. Her paintings tell the mythological stories of Lord Krishna and Ram and Sita, while emphasising on Sita's narrative of the story. Baua Devi uses handmade paper and natural colours for her paintings, predominantly using black, yellow, red and white in her palette. == Awards == * Padma Shri, 2017 * National Award, 1984 ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Indian women painters Category:20th-century artists Category:Hindu artists Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in arts ","title":"Baua Devi"},{"id":"60262513","text":"Turkey–Vietnam relations is the official bilateral relations between Turkey and Vietnam. Turkey has an embassy in Hanoi and Vietnam has an embassy in Ankara, a consulate in Istanbul. ==Historical relations== While relations between Turkey and Vietnam is less known comparing to other countries in the Sinosphere world, the Mongol Army invading Vietnam at 13th century was thought to be formed by majority of Turkic and Persian warriors fighting in the war. Many of them were entirely annihilated in all three failed invasions to Vietnam, which marked the first connection between the Vietnamese and Turks. After the failed invasions, the Turks would eventually immigrate to Anatolia and found the Ottoman Empire, and two countries would have no official link until 20th century. ===Vietnam War=== Vietnam went to headline in Turkey at 1960s as for the result of Vietnam War, which Turkey was requested to offer troops fighting in the war to assist its South Vietnamese and American allies against communist expansions, as Turkey is a NATO member. However, Turkey later rejected the offer and consolidated a more diplomatic approach. Turkey and Vietnam's relations would remain irrelevant until the end of Cold War. ==Modern relations== While Vietnam and Turkey established relations at 1978, it was not until 1990s that Vietnam became a growing economic and political partner of Turkey in the ASEAN. Both two countries are highly-rising profile economies, being parts of Next Eleven and CIVETS, thus earn reputation and receive larger trade and investment. For Vietnam, Turkey is seen as the gate to enter Middle Eastern market, which further bolstered economic cooperation between two countries. In 2017, Binali Yıldırım paid an official visit to Vietnam to increase economic and political cooperation between two countries.

When he was eight years old, he moved to Montevideo, Uruguay. He lived there until he moved to Miami, Florida in 2005. While his parents were at work, he was left alone at home where he recorded pornography from adult cable television channels to show to his friends. ==Internet phenomenon== ===Beginning=== In 2005, El Bananero decided to make videos to have fun with his friends. His content generally includes humour that is satirical, irreverent, foul, sexist, scatological, and obscene. He mocks taboo subjects such as sex and performs parodies of famous movies with his montage. His acts captured significant online attention in Latin America. He created his website, elbananero.com, to upload his videos and share them. A year later, when YouTube was established, he started a channel there, which quickly became popular among adolescents. ===Videos=== Among his popular content are the \\"Trailerazos,\\" which are videos in trailer format that parody famous Hollywood movies, including El Hombre Que araña (\\"The Man Who Scratches,\\" spoofing Spider-Man), Harry el Sucio Potter (\\"Harry The Dirty Potter,\\" parodying Harry Potter) and El Impotente Hulk (\\"The Impotent Hulk,\\" parodying The Incredible Hulk). The Iván el Trolazo Trailerazo (parodying the animated series He-Man) led to a lawsuit by Mattel, which shut down El Bananero's YouTube channel. He opened another channel which reached a million subscribers in 2016. His videos often show sexual organs, which led to their frequent removal by YouTube. His videos have been re-uploaded with censors. In January 2015, El Bananero surprised his followers by posting a photograph with one of the most popular pornstars of the time, Mia Khalifa. He then uploaded a video for his channel called Mia Khalifa vs. La Muñeca Psicótica System (Mia Khalifa vs. the Psychotic Doll System). ===Latin American shows=== In addition to earning a living as an audiovisual producer and YouTuber, he also performed stand-up comedy tours in Latin America. Since 2014, he's performed in Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica, Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay, Chile, and Bolivia. In 2016, El Bananero showed a penis drawn on his chest in a live television interview for CNN Chile, saying that he wanted to share this on CNN before saying goodbye. ==References== Category:American YouTubers Category:Internet memes Category:Comedy YouTubers Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Male YouTubers ","title":"El Bananero"},{"id":"60262520","text":"Sofia Ludvika Cecila Constancia Sheptytska (, 27 May 1837, Lviv, Austrian Empire, German Confederation— 17 April 1904, Prylbychi (now Yavoriv Raion Lviv Oblast Ukraine)), was a Polish countess, poet, painter.

The symbol dates to at least 2011 and has been attributed to anonymous East London artist Goldfrog ESP. The symbol has been called \\"this generation's peace sign\\". It is used by environmental protesters, and has been incorporated in works by artists and designers such as Banksy. In 2019, the Victoria and Albert Museum acquired a digital copy of the symbol, and other artifacts featuring the symbol, for its permanent collection. ==Attribution== In 2019, The Guardian reported that \\"Where the symbol has come from is something of a mystery\\". The Guardian noted that the most reliable attribution is to an anonymous East London artist known only as \\"ESP\\" or \\"Goldfrog ESP\\", who declines to be contacted directly except via his Extinction Symbol website, which has been supported by design media, and the wider media. In 2019, the New Statesman, reported that after ESP created the symbol in 2011, he contacted over 20 environmental groups to promote the symbol with little success. However, in 2018, the Extinction Rebellion (XR) contacted ESP regarding adoption and use of the symbol, and ESP clarified on his Extinction Symbol website, that the symbol is freely available to those who wish to use it for non-commercial purposes. In May 2019, Gail Bradbrook of XR issued a public statement to clarify that: \\"Not only does XR not support or endorse any corporations, it reminds them that the Extinction Symbol ⧖⃝ may never be used for commercial purposes, including fundraising. The Extinction Symbol is loaned in good faith to XR by UK street artist ESP\\". In 2019, noted typeface blogger, Jason Kottke, remarked that the above licensing structure means that while individuals can create their own clothing and signs using the symbol, a non-profit organization could not raise funds, or even use economies of scale, to mass-produce items for sale with the symbol. ==Meaning== In 2019, in an email interview with Ecohustler, ESP said the following on its creation: \\"At the start of 2011 I was just randomly sketching designs and as soon as I drew the symbol I knew what it was\\". ESP said they chose the circle to represent earth, and a stylized hourglass to represent that time is running out. The similarity with Gerald Holtom's black and white circular peace sign (the CND nuclear disarmament symbol) is noted, as is its similarity with the round black and white Circle-A symbol used by Anarchists. Other commentators have highlighted the \\"X\\" to as a \\"go-no-further\\" or halt sign. ESP said that while stylized, it was important it could be easily interpreted, saying: \\"I started off by chalking it really large on a wall down Brick Lane and some guys standing across the street were joking around, asking me if I thought I was Banksy or something. I just ignored them and carried on. Then they became curious about the meaning and one said \\"X marks the spot\\", then his friend said \\"No, time's running out\\". I turned around and was like \\"Yes!!\\". ==Usage== ===Protest=== Extinction Rebellion, London (2019) The symbol came to prominence when it came to be used by environmental action group Extinction Rebellion (XR) in protests around the world from 2018 onwards. The extinction symbol has been sprayed in removable chalk paint on government buildings during environmental protests in the United Kingdom, and at other protest venues across Europe. In April 2019, The Guardian described the symbol as \\"this generation's peace sign\\". At the Glastonbury Festival 2019, over 2,000 festival attendees re-created a human version of the extinction symbol. In July 2019, BBC News reported on a giant extinction symbol crop circle, while the XR noted other equivalent public displays of the extinction symbol around the world. In October, a temporary extinction symbol made from T-shirts was placed on the historic Alton Barnes White Horse. ===Art=== Extinction Rebellion (XR) have used external and internal graphic design teams to replicate the extinction symbol in many forms using inspiration from the Situationist International movement of the 1960s. British ceramic artist, Carrie Reichardt, featured the symbol in a 2016 piece titled Bees. Extinction Gong was an art installation by Crystelle Vu and Julian Oliver that features the symbol as a centerpiece; it was part of the 2018 Disappearing Legacies: The World as Forest exhibition in Berlin. In April 2019, a piece attributed to artist Banksy at Marble Arch in London, featured a child holding the extinction symbol. In July 2019, the Victoria and Albert Museum acquired a number of artifacts displaying the symbol as part of its permanent collection saying: \\"From its adoption (with permission) of the highly recognisable extinction symbol first designed in 2011 by the London street artist ESP to its limited but “punchy” colour palette and carefully worded slogans, she said the group had used design to galvanise concern for the climate emergency\\". ==See also== * Anarchist symbolism * Environmental art * Environmental movement * Peace symbols * Extinction events * List of extinction events * ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Extinction Symbol, the website of artist attributed with its creation * Meaning and origins of the extinction symbol, Brut (média) (April 2019) Category:Symbols Category:Political symbols Category:Symbols introduced in 2011 Category:Environmental art Category:Environmental artists Category:Extinction Rebellion ","title":"Extinction symbol"},{"id":"60262571","text":"Blake Ellis Hamilton (born October 26, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for APOEL of Cyprus Basketball Division 1.

Application of the least squares estimators is available to partially linear model, if the hypothesis of the known of nonparametric element is valid. Partially linear equations were first used in the analysis of the relationship between temperature and usage of electricity by Engle, Granger, Rice and Weiss (1986). Typical application of partially linear model in the field of Microeconomics is presented by Tripathi in the case of profitability of firm’s production in 1997. Also, partially linear model applied successfully in some other academic field. In 1994, Zeger and Diggle introduced partially linear model into biometrics. In environmental science, Parda-Sanchez et al used partially linear model to analysis collected data in 2000. So far, partially linear model was optimized in many other statistic methods. In 1988, Robinson applied Nadaraya-Waston kernel estimator to test the nonparametric element to build a least-squares estimator After that, in 1997, local linear method was found by Truong. == Partially Linear Model == thumb === Synopsis === ==== Algebra equation ==== The algebra expression of partially linear model is written as: y_i=\\\\delta_T^i\\\\beta+f(T_i)+\\\\mu_i ==== Equation components outline ==== \\\\delta^i_T and T_i: Vectors of explanatory variables. Independently random or fixed distributed variables. \\\\beta: To be measured Parameter. \\\\mu_i: The random error in statistics with 0 mean. f(T_i): To be measured part in partially linear model. === Assumption=== Wolfgang, Hua Liang and Jiti Gao consider the assumptions and remarks of partially linear model under fixed and random design conditions. When randomly distributed, introduce L_j(T_i)=E(\\\\delta_{i,j}T_i) and \\\\mu_{i,j}=\\\\delta_{i,j}-E(\\\\delta_{i,j}T_i) (1) E(\\\\delta_1  ^3 )T=t) is smaller than positive infinity when t value between 0 and 1, and the sum of covariance of \\\\delta_1 - E(\\\\delta_1T_1) is positive. The random errors µ are independent of (\\\\delta_i,T_i) , When \\\\delta_i and Ti are fixed distributed, L_j valued between 0 and 1, and \\\\delta_i satisfies \\\\delta_{ij}=L_j(T_i)+\\\\mu_{ij} , where factor i values between 1 and n, and factor j value between 1 and p, Error factor \\\\mu_{ij} satisfies, \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}1/n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mu_i\\\\mu_i^T=\\\\sum . === The least square (LS) estimators=== The precondition of application of the least squares estimators is the existence of nonparametric component, and running at random distributed and fixed distributed cases. Engle, Granger, Rice and Weiss’s (1986) smoothing model should be first introduced, before applying the least squares estimators. The algebra function of their model is expressed as Y=\\\\delta^T\\\\beta+f(t) (2). Wolfgang, Liang and Gao (1988) make an assumption that the pair (ß,g) satisfies 1/n \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\displaystyle E\\\\\\\\{Y_i-\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta-f(T_i)\\\\\\\\}^2=min1/n\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\displaystyle E\\\\\\\\{Y_i-\\\\delta_i^T-f(T_i)\\\\\\\\}^2 (3). This means that for all 1≤i≤n, \\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta_1+f_1(T_i)=\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta_2+f_2(T_i) . So, f_1 = f_2 and \\\\beta_1 = \\\\beta_2 . Under random distributed case, Wolfgang, Hua Liang and Jiti Gao assume that for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, E[Y_i(\\\\delta_i,T_i)]=\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta1+f_1(T_i)=\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta_2+f_2(T_i) (4) so, E\\\\\\\\{Y_i-\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta_1-f_1(T_i)\\\\\\\\}^2=E\\\\\\\\{Y_i-\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta_2-f_2(T_i)\\\\\\\\}^2+(\\\\beta_1-\\\\beta_2)^TE\\\\\\\\{(\\\\delta_i-E[\\\\delta_iT_i])(\\\\delta_i-E[\\\\delta_iT_i]^T)\\\\\\\\}(\\\\beta_1-\\\\beta_2) \\\\beta_1=\\\\beta_2 , due to E\\\\\\\\{(\\\\delta_i-E[\\\\delta_iT_i])(\\\\delta_i-E[\\\\delta_iT_i]^T)\\\\\\\\} is a positive number, as function (1) proved.So, f_j(T_i)=E[Y_iT_i]-E[\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta_jT_i] established for all 1≤i≤n and j equals to 1and 2 when f_1=f_2 . Under fixed distributed case, By parameterizing factor from smoothing model (2) as \\\\\\\\{f(T_1),.........,f(T_n)\\\\\\\\}^T=\\\\omega_r and \\\\omega_r = Q(Y-x\\\\beta) where Q=\\\\omega(\\\\omega^T\\\\omega)^{-1}\\\\omega^T . By making same assumption as (4), which follows from assumption (1), \\\\beta_1=\\\\beta_2 and f_1=f_2 under the fact of 1/nE\\\\\\\\{(Y-X\\\\beta_1-\\\\omega_{r1})^T(Y-X\\\\beta_1-\\\\omega_{r1})\\\\\\\\}=1/nE{(Y-X\\\\beta_2-\\\\omega_{r2})^T(Y-X\\\\beta_2-\\\\omega_{r2})}+1/n(\\\\beta_1-\\\\beta_2)^TX^T(1-Q)X(\\\\beta_1-\\\\beta_2) . Assuming factors \\\\delta_i,T_i,Y_i (i here are positive integers) satisfies y_i=\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta+f(T_i)+\\\\mu_i and establish positive weight functions \\\\psi_{ni}(t) . Any estimators of f(t) , for every \\\\beta , we have f_n(t;\\\\beta)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\psi_{ni}(t)(Y_i-\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta) . By applying LS criterion, the LS estimator of \\\\beta_{LS}=\\\\\\\\{(\\\\tilde{\\\\delta}^T\\\\tilde{\\\\delta})\\\\\\\\}^{-1}\\\\tilde{\\\\delta}^T\\\\tilde{Y} . The nonparametric estimator of f(n) is expressed as \\\\hat{f_n}(t)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\psi_{ni}(t)(Y_i-\\\\delta_i^T\\\\beta_{LS}). So, When the random errors are identically distributed, the estimators of variance \\\\sigma^2 is expressed as, \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_n^2=1/n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\\\tilde{Y_i}-\\\\tilde{\\\\delta_i^T}\\\\beta_{LS}). === History and Applications of partially linear model === The real-world application of partially linear model was first considered for analyzing data by Engle, Granger, Rice and Weiss in 1986. In their point of view, the relevance between temperature and the consumption of electricity cannot be expressed in a linear model, because there are massive of confounding factors, such as average income, goods price, consumer purchase ability and some other economic activities. Some of the factors are relevance with each other and might influence the observed result. Therefore, they introduced partially linear model, which contained both with parametric and nonparametric factors. The partially linear model enables and simplifies the linear transformation of data (Engle, Granger, Rice and Weiss, 1986). They also applied the smoothing spline technique for their research. There was a case of application of partially linear model in biometrics by Zeger and Diggle in 1994. The research objective of their paper is the evolution period cycle of CD4 cell amounts in HIV (Human immune-deficiency virus) seroconverters (Zeger and Diggle, 1994). CD4 cell plays a significant role in immune function in human body. Zeger and Diggle aimed to assess the proceed of disease by measuring the changing amount of CD4 cells. The number of CD4 cell is associated with body age and smoking behavior and so on. To clear the group of observation data in their experiment, Zeger and Diggle applied partially linear model for their work. Partially linear model primarily contributes to the estimation of average loss time of CD4 cells and adjusts the time dependence of some other covariables in order to simplify the proceed of data comparison, and also, the partially linear model characterizes the deviation of typical curve for their observed group to estimate the progression curve of the changing amount of CD4 cell. The deviation, granted by partially linear model, potentially helps to recognize the observe targets who had a slow progression on the amounting change of CD4 cells. In 1999, Schmalensee and Stoker (1999) have used partially linear model in the field of economics. The independent variable of their research is the demand of gasoline in The United State. The primary research target in their paper is the relationship between gasoline consumption and long-run income elasticity in the U.S. Similarly, there are also massive of confounding variables, which might mutually affect. Hence, Schmalemsee and Stoker chose to deal with the issues of linear transformation of data between parametric and nonparametric by applying partially linear model. In the field of environment science, Prada-Sanchez used partially linear model to predict the sulfur dioxide pollution in 2000 (Prada-Sanchez, 2000), and in the next year, Lin and Carroll applied partially linear model for clustered data (Lin and Carroall, 2001). === Development of partially linear model === According to Liang’s paper in 2010 (Liang, 2010), The smoothing spline technique was introduced in partially linear model by Engle, Heckman and Rice in 1986. After that, Robinson found an available LS estimator for nonparametric factors in partially linear model in 1988. At the same year, profile LS method was recommended by Speckman. === Other econometrics tools in partially linear model === Kernel regression also was introduced in partially linear model. The local constant method, which is developed by Speckman, and local linear techniques, which was found by Hamilton and Truong in 1997 and was revised by Opsomer and Ruppert in 1997, are all included in kernel regression. Green et al, Opsomer and Ruppert found that one of the significant characteristic of kernel-based methods is that under-smoothing has been taken in order to find root-n estimator of beta. However, Speckman’s research in 1988 and Severini’s and Staniswalis’s research in 1994 proved that those restriction might be canceled. ==== Bandwidth selection in partially linear model ==== Bandwidth selection in partially linear model is a confusing issue. Liang addressed a possible solution for this bandwidth selection in his literature by applying profile-kernel based method and backfitting methods. Also the necessity of undersmoothing for backfitting method and the reason why profile-kernel based method can work out the optimal bandwidth selection were justified by Liang. The general computation strategy is applied in Liang’s literature for estimating nonparametric function. Moreover, the penalized spline method for partially linear models and intensive simulation experiments were introduced to discover the numerical feature of the penalized spline method, profile and backfitting methods. ==== Kernel-Based Profile and BackFitting method ==== By introducing E(YT)={E(XT)}^T\\\\beta+g(T) Following with Y-E(YT)={X-E(XT)}^T\\\\beta+\\\\epsilon The intuitive estimator of ß can be defined as the LS estimator after appropriately estimating E(YT)andE(XT). Then, for all random vector variable \\\\xi, assume \\\\hat{E}(\\\\xiT)is a kernel regression estimator of E(\\\\xiT). Let \\\\tilde{\\\\xi}=\\\\xi-E(\\\\xiT),\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{XT} \\\\displaystyle=cov{X-E(XT)}. For example, \\\\tilde{X}_i=X_i-E(X_iT_i). Denote Y=(Y_1,...,Y_n)^TX,g and T similarly.

Ruppert and Carroll in 2000 and Brumback, Ruppert and Wand in 1999 employed this method in LME framework. Assuming function g(t)can be estimated by g(t,\\\\tau)=\\\\tau_0+\\\\tau_1t+...+\\\\tau_pt^p+\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\displaystyle b_k(t-\\\\xi_k)^p where p\\\\geqslant1is an integer, and \\\\xi_1<...<\\\\xi_kare fixed knots, a_+=max(a,0).Denote \\\\tau=(tau_0,...,\\\\tau_p)^TConsider Y=X^T\\\\beta+g(T,\\\\tau)+\\\\epsilon. The penalized spline estimator (\\\\hat{\\\\beta_{ps}^T},\\\\hat{\\\\tau_{ps}^T})^T of (\\\\beta^T,\\\\tau^T)^Tis defined as follow \\\\sum_{i=1}^n [Y_i- X_i^T\\\\beta_i-g(T_i,\\\\tau)]^2+\\\\alpha\\\\sum_{k=1}^Kb_k^2 Where \\\\alphais a smoothing parameter. As Brumback et al mentioned in 1999, the estimator (\\\\hat{\\\\beta_{ps}^T},\\\\hat{\\\\tau_{ps}^T})^T is same as the estimator of \\\\beta based on LME model. y=\\\\Lambda(\\\\beta^T,\\\\tau^T)^T+Zb+\\\\epsilon, where \\\\Lambda=\\\\begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & ... & x_{1d} & 1 & T_1 & ... & T_1^p\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{21} & ... & x_{2d} & 1 & T_2 & ... & T_2^p\\\\\\\\\\\\ . & ... & . & . & . & ... & .\\\\\\\\\\\\ . & ... & . & . & . & ... & .\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. & ... & . & . & . & ... & .\\\\\\\\\\\\x_{n1} & ... & x_{nd} & 1 & T_n & ... & T_n^p \\\\end{pmatrix}, Z=\\\\begin{pmatrix} (T_1-\\\\xi_1)^p & ... & (T_1-\\\\xi_K)_+^p \\\\\\\\\\\\ (T_2-\\\\xi_1)^p & ... & (T_2-\\\\xi_K)_+^p\\\\\\\\\\\\ . & ... & . \\\\\\\\\\\\ . & ... & . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. & ... & . \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(T_n-\\\\xi_1)^p & ... & (T_n-\\\\xi_K)_+^p \\\\end{pmatrix} Where b=(b_1,...,b_k)^T \\\\backsim (0,\\\\sigma_b^2),\\\\epsilon=(\\\\epsilon_1,...,\\\\epsilon_n)^T \\\\sim (0,\\\\sigma_\\\\epsilon^2), and \\\\alpha=\\\\sigma_\\\\epsilon^2/\\\\sigma_b^2.

In 1998, Roman Mints and oboist Dmitry Bulgakov founded the Homecoming Chamber Music Festival which takes place annually in Moscow. The core of Homecoming concert programmes are themed selections of works with one powerful underlying but not necessarily musical, idea behind them. Since the inception of the festival, Roman Mints has authored more than 60 such programmes. In April 2002, he co-directed the Suppressed Music project in Russia, which consisted of two concerts and a conference on composers whose music had been suppressed. A book and CD were released as a result of this project, by the Klassika XXI Publishing House. Outside the classical field, Roman has worked with free-improvising saxophonist Paul Dunmall, vocalist Alisa Ten, the Brian Irvine Ensemble, Pokrovsky Ensemble, and Russian IDM group EU. He has also participated in several theatre productions including Langer's \\"Ariadne\\" and Stravinsky’s \\"The Soldier’s Tale\\". He has worked with theatre directors Vasily Barkhatov and Tim Hopkins, choreographers Alla Sigalova and Oleg Glushkov, and film director Alexander Zeldovich. His recording of the Mozetich Violin Concerto \\"Affairs of the Heart\\" was used in productions by Hong Kong Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Q-dance company. Roman Mints plays a Francesco Ruggieri violin, circa 1685. == Recordings == Roman Mints has recorded for ECM, Harmonia Mundi, Quartz and other labels, with his albums featuring a number of world-premiere recordings. An album of works by Dobrinka Tabakova for ECM was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Classical Compendium.

The moving force, main editor and writer of the publication was Geoffrey Rushton, who would later assume the name John Balance and become known as singer and lyricist of the influential postindustrial band Coil (the following will employ the better-known pseudonym). Balance was still at school during most of the period of the magazine’s publication (Lord Williams’s School, not – as widely misreported – Oundle School), though he would continue to publish the magazine for a short period after leaving and before his career in music began to take off. The other founding editor was a school friend of Balance’s, Tom Craig (Craig would be succeeded as coeditor by another school friend, Euan Craik). The magazine included interviews with, articles on and reviews of releases and performances by many leading alternative bands and solo artists of the time, such as: Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, SPK, Virgin Prunes, Alternative TV, Eyeless in Gaza, Monte Cazazza, and participants in the so-called ‘cassette culture’, such as: The Door and the Window, The Good Missionaries, Cultural Amnesia. The magazine also featured drawings and collages by Balance, sometimes employing the pseudonym Murderwerkers (Balance would use both Stabmental and Murderwerkers as pseudonyms for his earliest musical releases). Stabmental published seven issues between 1979 and 1982, including one double issue (4/5) and one issue (6) in the form of a cassette-tape compilation entitled The Men with the Deadly Dreams (conceived, compiled and designed by Balance). The photocopied magazine was in stapled A4 format, with text produced on typewriter. The print runs were very limited, certainly not exceeding 500 copies. It sold by mail order and through the London alternative-music shop Rough Trade. The magazine is now a sought-after collector’s item. The cover of Stabmental 7, the final issue, included a hand-finished element, with each copy therefore unique – an anticipation of Balance’s enthusiasm for handcrafted editions of Coil releases. An energetic correspondent and mail artist, Balance made many important contacts in the alternative music scene through his work on Stabmental and it is through the magazine that he met his musical and life partner, Peter Christopherson, then of Throbbing Gristle.

The file typically specifies which probes map to the same genomic unit of interest. This mapping methodology solves the problem of a reliable reconstruction of expression levels as, if more than one probeset per gene exists, expression signals for the same transcript may be enhanced incorrectly. Genomic units of interest may include: Expression, Genotyping, CustomSeq, Copy Number and/or Tag probe sets. All probe set names within an array are unique. Multiple copies of a probe set may exist on a single array as long as each copy has a unique name.

As part of the process, recruitment rolls had to be filled during the summer, in order for training to be conducted in the fall. During the location selection process, the Oak Grove Fairgrounds in Warren, Ohio was chosen as one of the sites where the prospective soldiers trained. In Hutchins' honor, the training site was named Camp Hutchins. With the American Civil War's outbreak, both the North and South weren't prepared for conflict. Following the Confederate States of America's attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 trained volunteers to assist in Union military efforts. Ohio Governor William Dennison Jr. wanted to utilize his state's militia forces to aid Lincoln. Unfortunately for Dennison, many of Ohio's militia forces were no longer in existence by spring 1861. Dennison initially encouraged communities across the state to send their militia companies to Columbus, Ohio for possible use by the North during the Civil War. Eventually, Camp Hutchins was established in Warren, where training began in October 1861. == 6th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry == With their official designation as the 6th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, the training for these soldiers commenced on October 7, 1861 at Camp Hutchins in Warren. More than 800 soldiers comprised the cavalry. Authorized by the War Department to serve in the Civil War, the cavalry became the second regiment in Wade & Hutchins' Cavalry Brigade. Camp Hutchins only remained in use until the end of 1861. During training, the regiment received support from their Warren community in the form of a Thanksgiving feast, a Christmas Eve ball in Warren's Gaskill House, and a New Year's picnic. The 6th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry would eventually depart at the beginning of 1862. In January 1862, the regiment relocated to Camp Dennison for drill instruction. In March, the regiment was assigned to guard Confederate prisoners at Camp Chase. During the Civil War, the regiment shifted command several times, eventually engaging in conflict with General Robert E. Lee and his Confederate forces at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Following Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse, the regiment escorted Grant from Appomattox to Burkesville Station. In August 1865, the 6th Ohio was mustered out of service in Cleveland. In total, casualties for the 6th Ohio reached 238. == Current dedication == The former site of Camp Hutchins stands as an official landmark in Warren's history. Camp Hutchins shared the same location as the Trumbull County Fairgrounds and the present-day Warren G. Harding High School campus. In 2012, the landmark was dedicated while students from Harding performed music that dated back a century and a half ago. In a 2012 WFMJ (Youngstown) article, Wendell Lauth, a member of the Civil War 150 Committee, dedicated to honoring the, at the time, 150th anniversary of the Civil War, said; It's a perfect teaching lesson in local history for high school classes.\\" == References == Category:American Civil War army posts ","title":"Camp Hutchins"},{"id":"60263134","text":"John-Clay Purves MD (1825–1903) was a British geologist and museum curator. ==Biography== Purves initially qualified in medicine at the University of Edinburgh before joining the army and travelling as an army doctor.

Kolokwa is 99 percent an oral language — as yet, there is not a single full book in the dialect — and it is all but incomprehensible to the American ear. In Liberia, the cultural elite have long shunned it as lowbrow. Which means that when HipCo artists inject a few choice snatches of Kolokwa into otherwise English lyrics, their words have political zing.\\" According to the Washington Post, \\"HipCo is to Liberia as jazz is to the United States.\\" In 2017, Liberian historian C. Patrick Burrows stated \\"we're on the verge of a renaissance, and HipCo is at the leading edge of it.\\" == Artists == Among high-profile Hipco artists are Takun J.

This had led to scrutiny and hostilities from the Turks towards the Hashemites due to the Hashemites' attempt to create a post-Ottoman state, which ended up in failure. ===Modern relations=== Following the Turkish War of Independence, Sharif Abdullah and founder of Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had a close personal relationship, even met each other in Istanbul at 1937.

It is considered the first Uruguayan film. The only known copy is preserved in the archives of Cinemateca Uruguaya. ==Plot== The film portrays a cycling race at the Arroyo Seco velodrome, formerly located in Agraciada. The film shows four cyclists rounding the track while the audience claps. At one point, two women attempt to cross the track, but are forced back into the audience by the oncoming bicycles. The two women are finally able to reach the center of the track and two men standing in the center cross into the stands to join the audience. ==Production== The film lasts four minutes. It was directed by Catalan ship owner Félix Oliver, who had purchased a camera, a projector and rolls of film in Europe. Most experts believe that \\"Carrerra\\" was filmed in 1898, but Juan Pablo Lepra has conjectured that the film was shot between October 1901 and the beginning of 1903, due to several sources that mention the velodrome was operational between these dates.

K-117 was first designated as a state highway on May 26, 1937, to connect to the new highway that was constructed by the Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT). K-117's alignment has not changed since it was designated. ==Route description== K-117 begins at an intersection with US-36 in Midway and begins traveling north and after roughly crosses and unnamed creek. Approximately past the creek, the road crosses a BNSF Railway just east of Herndon. The highway continues north and after about intersects County Route 314 (CR-314) also known as Rural Secondary (RS-675). It continues northward for roughly another and reaches the Nebraska border where it continues as N-17. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 215 vehicles slightly north of Herndon to 265 vehicles south of Herndon.

It follows a group of university students who try to survive the undead during a deadly viral outbreak. The film was theatrically released on January 29, 2020. ==Plot== Several news reports that an unknown viral epidemic has been sweeping the Philippines. Meanwhile, Mario brings his daughter PJ, a medical student, to her first day in her senior year at San Lazaro University. Due to his previous work as an OFW and his inability to pay his daughter's tuition, Mario has a strained relationship with PJ, who is still traumatized from failing to save her mother from a fatal stroke. She reunites with her block mates in Block Z: fellow med students and longtime friends Erika and Myles, and Block Z basketball team captain Lucas, who harbors feelings for PJ. Mario accidentally hits a pedestrian who secretly intended to scam him of money, but Mario instead brings the man to San Lazaro's hospital, where he meets with PJ again. PJ and Erika are assigned to take care of Angie, a mother who has what appears to be a human bite in her leg. Angie suddenly has a seizure and dies shortly after, and PJ goes to comfort Angie's young daughter Ruby over her mother's death. Myles and fellow student Gary head over to bring Angie's body to the morgue, but Angie reanimates and bites Gary's neck, causing Myles to flee. Angie begins attacking other people in the hospital, causing others to be infected and reanimate as undead, forcing Mario and the pedestrian to flee together. The undead begins slaughtering several students and personnel around the university, including Lucas' team where he emerges as the only survivor. Lucas meets Mario and the pedestrian, but the latter had been bitten and turned, forcing the two to kill him. The two then separate, with both intending to find PJ. Student council president Gelo calls his general father for evacuation via helicopter on the hospital's helipad and tells his vice president Vanessa not to tell anyone as he only informed his father to make room for the two of them. Despite this, Vanessa secretly informs the university councilors to spread the word. Lucas manages to find PJ with Erika and Myles and the four work together to flee the school. The military quarantines the university, but they are forced to kill both zombies and students fleeing from the front gate. Gelo confronts Vanessa for telling the university body about his helicopter, and Vanessa chastises him for looking out for himself when he has the resources to help everyone. They scuffle and Gelo accidentally pushes Vanessa off a staircase, killing her; when PJ's group stumbles upon the scene, Gelo lies and says she was infected and had to take her out in self-defense, and he joins the group. The group plans their route to the hospital, but when they become overwhelmed with zombies, they are rescued by Mario in the school's church. Mario has managed to hole up in the church with Ruby and security guard Bebeth. Gelo reveals that people have to be left behind as his helicopter can only fit two people, which angers the others in the process before the group convinces him that he needs them to survive. The group passes by the faculty next, but when Ruby sees her zombified mother, she rushes to her and alerts the herd to their location. Ruby is devoured in the process, and the others are forced to leave when Gelo goes to the faculty and locks them out. The group temporarily rests in the dormitory, where they reminisce on their past and PJ and Mario reconcile, but a zombie attacks and bites Mario before it is killed. Mario tells the group to kill him to prevent him from turning, but the group opts to lock him inside the dorm's closet, and he says his final goodbyes to PJ before they leave him. Although the group manages to discover the zombies' weaknesses to headshots and water, their numbers begin dwindling: Myles is mortally wounded by a stray zombie and makes a last stand before he is killed, Bebeth stays behind fending off zombies from the others, and Erika sacrifices herself to let PJ and Lucas escape. The two manage to reach the hospital's rooftop, where Lucas lifts PJ to the helipad before using himself as bait to lure zombies away by jumping off the building. A sorrowful PJ loses consciousness and awakens the next day with no helicopter in sight. She sees that she has a bite mark in her hand and realizes that she is immune to the virus, so she fights her way back to the dorms, killing several zombies including Angie in the process. PJ reunites with Mario, who is also immune, and the two decide to explore an ancient tunnel underneath the church that Ruby had previously discovered. There, they encounter Gelo, who is delirious from being infected and jaded from being seemingly abandoned by his father. The two manage to evade him and escape through a manhole and leave Gelo to be devoured by approaching zombies. PJ and Mario realize that the infection has spread beyond the university into the wider city, and they arm themselves. News reports begin sharing the zombie's vulnerability to water. Bebeth broadcasts a message that she had survived. A large typhoon engulfs the Philippines, weakening and killing many of the undead in the process. Two weeks after the typhoon, a group of raiders discovers a heavily injured but still-alive Lucas, and their leader decides to take him in. ==Cast== *Julia Barretto as Princess Joy “PJ”, a medical student from San Lazaro University and Lucas’ love interest *Joshua Garcia as Lucas, a varsity basketball team captain in San Lazaro and PJ’s love interest *Ian Veneracion as Mario, PJ's doting father *Maris Racal as Erika, PJ's best friend *McCoy de Leon as Myles, a medical student who is friends with PJ, Erika, and Lucas *Yves Flores as Gelo, the student council president and son of a prominent corrupt general *Ina Raymundo as Angie, a mother who becomes patient zero of the outbreak within the university *Dimples Romana as Bebeth, a guard at San Lazaro University *Myrtle Sarrosa as Vanessa, the social media- savvy vice president of the school's student council *Angel Locsin (cameo role) as the unnamed leader of a group of raiders ==Production== Block Z will mark the sixth feature film and second studio film for director Mikhail Red, following Rekorder (2013), Birdshot (2016), Neomanila (2017), Eerie (2019), and Dead Kids (2019).

The plans for the new graduate college, preliminarily named Parks College, were announced in December 2018. It is the first new Oxbridge college since 1990, when the graduate Kellogg College was established. It will be located in the Science Area on the historic Radcliffe Science Library site. ==History== The establishment of Parks College was approved by a vote in the university congregation on 7 May 2019. On 11 June 2020, the University announced that it had received an £80 million gift from the Reuben Foundation towards an endowment and scholarships, which would be marked by changing the name of the college to Reuben College. The college was formally renamed on 30 June 2020. The planned initial intake of graduate students is in the 2021–2022 academic year with an eventual annual intake of 200 students, studying for research degrees and on taught courses. Initially there will be a focus on three interdisciplinary research clusters, which will be increased to six or eight clusters once there is a full complement of graduate students. Professor Lionel Tarassenko (head of the Department of Engineering Science) was invited by the Vice-Chancellor, Louise Richardson, to oversee the development of the college as its founding president. The college appointed its first fellows in 2019, including Jane A. McKeating and E. J. Milner-Gulland. == Buildings == The current Radcliffe Science Library (RSL) building is located next to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and consists of three parts: * The Jackson Wing, parallel to South Parks Road, is Grade II listed. Designed by Sir Thomas Jackson it opened in 1901. It is arranged over 3 floors, all above ground. * The Worthington Wing, parallel to Parks Road, was designed as an extension to the Jackson Wing in 1934 by Hubert Worthington. The wing extends to the north of the western end of the Jackson Wing and contains the entrance hall on the ground floor. * The Lankester Room and Main Stack, a two-storey extension under the lawn of the museum, built between 1972 and 1975. Reuben College will also consist of the western wing of the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory and Abbot’s Kitchen. Completion of the redevelopment of the RSL building is scheduled for the start of the 2021–2022 academic year. Completion of the redevelopment of the western wing of the Inorganic Chemistry Lab (the potential space for the dining hall), Abbot’s Kitchen and connecting spaces is scheduled for the start of the 2022–2023 academic year. Student accommodation will be offered in the newly refurbished building at Farndon Court. ==Academic focus== The college has identified three key areas of knowledge which will be the focus of its research: *Artificial intelligence and machine learning *Environmental change *Cellular life. ==Administration== Together with Kellogg and St Cross, Reuben is one of only three Oxford colleges without a royal charter. It is officially a society of the university rather than an independent college. The main difference from an independent college is that the governing body only recommends a president, who is then appointed by Council; in other colleges, the head of house is elected and appointed by the governing body directly. For accounting purposes, the societies are considered departments of the university. ==References== ==External links== * Reuben College website Category:Colleges of the University of Oxford Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Oxford Category:Grade II listed buildings in Oxford Category:Grade II listed educational buildings Category:Proposals in the United Kingdom Category:Educational institutions established in 2019 Category:2019 establishments in England ","title":"Reuben College, Oxford"},{"id":"60263798","text":"The Perico worm lizard (Amphisbaena pericensis) is a worm lizard species in the family Amphisbaenidae.

The isles are a grouping of four mangrove islands that were developed and connected in the 1950s. The isles are connected by Capri Boulevard, and can be accessed from nearby State Route 951 (Collier Blvd). Isles of Capri is located just north of Marco Island. == Background == Isles Of Capri, aerial view Leland L. \\"Doc\\" Loach purchased four mangrove islands in 1955. Soon after, the isles were dredged and connected to form its current configuration. Today, Isles of Capri is a vacation, boating and fishing community, evidenced by the numerous docks and a large marina located on the isles. Residents and visitors are attracted to the Isles by water activities and canal, bay and Gulf of Mexico views. Like Collier County, the island has both a permanent and seasonal population. The population drops significantly in the summer. While much of Isles of Capri is residential, what the locals call the \\"commercial island\\" is the home to multiple restaurants, marinas and real estate offices. La Peninsula, a condominium community made up of seven individual complexes, sits at the southwestern tip of Isles of Capri. == Geography and climate == Much of Isles of Capri sits in the Rookery Bay preserve. The isles are surrounded by shallow saltwater bays. A broad array of fish, manatees and bottlenose dolphins live in the water around the isles. Located south of Naples and along the coast of the Gulf Of Mexico, Isles of Capri features a tropical climate with a pronounced dry season from November through April. Daytime highs range from the mid 70s Fahrenheit in January to the low 90s Fahrenheit in July. The area is typically frost-free. Occasional cold fronts can drop nighttime lows into the 30s and 40s Fahrenheit during the winter months for a day or two at a time. Temperature extremes are modulated when compared to inland Collier County because the water surrounding the isles is warm for much of the year. Hurricanes occasionally affect Isles of Capri.

She was educated at the Sacred Heart Convent in Saint Joseph, Missouri, and attended Washington University in St. Louis. She developed an interest in the arts at an early age, and performed in opera productions in Missouri in her teens. She later attended the Arts Student League in New York City, where she studied drawing. While looking for ideas for a theater's poster competition as a student, she visited an NYC theater and met a producer who suggested she give acting a try. From there, she appeared in plays and vaudeville sketches all over the country during the 1910s. She was working as a play broker by the early 1920s, securing the American rights to works by Parisian composer Andre de Croisset, among other projects. She was also in charge of a stable of actors she represented as an agent. She had settled in Los Angeles by 1924 after chaperoning her client—the young, innocent Clara Bow—on her journey from New York to Hollywood. Alton had secured Bow a contract with B.P. Schulberg. Two years later, Alton had begun to try her luck at screenwriting; her first credit was on The Cowboy and the Countess, which she co-wrote with Adele Buffington. She wrote a string of screenplays through the end of the decade, ending with 1930's Call of the Circus. In the early 1930s, she returned to writing plays and novels.

The congregation began in 1825 as a Methodist class and its Gothic Revival style brick church building was completed in 1866. Note: This includes , , and Accompanying photographs It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Architecture and construction== Interior of Trinity UMC during a candle light Christmas service The architectural firm Mursinna & Boyd designed the church's primary 150-by-76-foot structure, modeling it after St. Paul’s M. E. Church in Newark, New Jersey (dedicated in 1856). In 1864 the Evansville Daily Journal reported the church hoped to provide \\"one of the very handsomest church edifices in the whole western country.\\" Work on the church began in early 1864 in the midst of the American Civil War, providing substantial challenges since many of the church's congregants fought in the conflict and their families back home dealt with related stress. By June 1865, an upper meeting room later called Craig Hall was completed and housed services until the main sanctuary was finished in spring 1866. The new building was formally dedicated on March 25, 1866. The final construction included approximately 400,000 bricks. The interior of the original church included a grand auditorium, three classrooms, a minister's study, a trustees' meeting room, and a 36-by-68 foot lecture room on the second floor (later called Craig Hall). In the 1920s Trinity added a Tudor- style wing containing classrooms, offices, a kitchen, and full gymnasium. Replacing the Greek Revival columns, pediments, and large cornices popular earlier in the nineteenth century, Gothic-style buildings had gained popularity by the 1840s as the Romantic movement in Europe rediscovered heavenward-pointed arches of the Middle Ages. Except for spires and window size, Trinity's exterior is identical to St. Paul’s M. E. Church in Newark. Inside there are more significant differences, including the height of the ceiling and the height of the windows, with Trinity's much higher in both cases. Trinity's facade consists of two towering spires, one on each side extending vertically into the air. Such vertical facades were common among European Gothic churches. In choosing a twin spire facade, the architect separated the design for Trinity from the traditional American (Protestant) Gothic revival church which called for a single frontal spire. Although the church lacks cross-ribbed vaults which are typical of Gothic Revival architecture, Trinity does feature buttresses, pointed arches, and other characteristics giving form to the Gothic beauty, including arched openings and an octagonal steeple. ==History== Exterior courtyard of Trinity UMC on Easter Sunday with its \\"living cross\\" Trinity traces its beginning to a Methodist class formed in 1825 by Robert Parrett and 11 other Evansville residents. The group built their first building in 1839 in downtown Evansville between Second and Third Streets and on the south side of Locust Street, naturally calling it the Locust Street Methodist Episcopal Church. By 1860 Trinity's members began planning their larger structure that exists today. The church's minister during the construction (which coincided with the Civil War) was Rev. Albion Fellows, father to social reformer Albion Fellows Bacon and author Annie Fellows Johnston. Both sisters later married their respective husbands at the church on the same day (October 11, 1888). Due to the church's geographical move away from Locust Street, it needed a new name and the congregation decided upon Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church. Trinity helped plant most other Methodist churches in the region and also created or helped create many organizations, including the University of Evansville and local chapters of YWCA, Habitat for Humanity, Tri-State Food Bank, soup kitchens, and Meals on Wheels. Throughout its history many of Evansville's most prominent citizens have been members of the church, including the Bacons, the Carpenter family (which built Willard Carpenter House and Willard Library), the Ingles, the Igleharts, Congressman Lee H. Hamilton (whose father served as Trinity's pastor from 1943 to 1953), and William Bartelt. ==References== ==External links== *Trinity UMC's website Category:Methodist churches in Indiana Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Indiana Category:Churches completed in 1866 Category:Churches in Evansville, Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Evansville, Indiana ","title":"Trinity United Methodist Church (Evansville, Indiana)"},{"id":"60264175","text":"Robin Hutson (born 1956/1957) is a British hotelier, listed by The Caterer as the UK's second most powerful hotelier. ==Early life== At the age of 14, his parents decided that he should attend a grammar school in Surrey, rather than London.

Directed by Daniel J. Clark, the film was released in the United States on November 15, 2018, and for wide release on Netflix in February 2019. The documentary details ideas of the flat Earth from different perspectives, including prominent flat-Earthers Mark Sargent, Nathan Thompson, and Patricia Steere, as well as astrophysicists from universities including UCLA and Caltech. It features clips from the 2017 International Flat Earth Conference, held in North Carolina, US, which attracted hundreds of attendees. == Synopsis == Behind the Curve primarily focuses on flat Earth proponent Mark Sargent and his life as an active member of the flat Earth community. Sargent discusses his interpretation of flat Earth theory, and his role as an advocate, as well as his series of YouTube videos and podcasts. It also follows Sargent as he attends various flat Earth gatherings. Other flat Earth believers featured include Patricia Steere, creator of the podcast Flat Earth and Other Hot Potatoes; and Jeran Campanella and Bob Knodel, creators of the GlobeBusters YouTube channel. Professionals in the scientific community, including astronaut Scott Kelly, are interviewed about their views on the flat Earth conspiracy, and to discuss the current scientific views on conspiracies and the possible consequences of a lack of critical thinking in society. Throughout the film, flat Earth advocates discuss their experimental approaches to proving their theory. It also covers several conferences and meet-ups that the film's subjects attend, including the 2017 International Flat Earth Conference, held in Raleigh, North Carolina, US. When director Clark was asked in an interview about lessons from the film he said, \\"my dream would be that when people watch it, they take flat Eartherism as an analogy to something they believe in, because it’s so easy to demonize another group or another person for something they think but you’re kind of just as guilty if you do that.\\" == Release == Behind the Curve was first released at Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, Toronto, Canada, on April 30, 2018. It has since been screened at various film festivals around the world. == Reception == The film has received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary holds a \\"100% Certified Fresh\\" approval rating based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. Reviews described the film as \\"hilarious, informative, but pressing\\" and \\"empathetic\\", with several commentators praising its \\"humanistic look at some of the most ridiculed people in America.\\" == References Category:2018 documentary films Category:2018 films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentaries about science Category:Flat Earth Category:American films ","title":"Behind the Curve"},{"id":"60264286","text":"Hector Philp is a former Rhodesian international lawn bowler.

Nine £1 million notes were issued in connection with the Marshall Plan on 30 August 1948, signed by E.E. Bridges, and were used internally as \\"records of movement\\" for a six-week period, along with other denominations, with total face value of £300 million, corresponding to a loan from the U.S. to help shore up the UK Treasury. These were cancelled on 6 October 1948, and presumably destroyed, except for the £1 million \\"Number Seven\\" and \\"Number Eight\\" notes (serial numbers 000007 and 000008), which were given to the UK and U.S. treasury secretaries. These two have been in private hands since 1977, and most recently, the \\"Number Eight\\" was auctioned for £69,000.

Until 2006, these Treasury Notes were issued by the Bank of England, in the City of London. HM Treasury would manage its cash and ensure that adequate funds were available. London's banks and other financial institutions would bid for these instruments, at a discount, specifying which day the following week they wanted the bills issued. Maturities would be for one, three, six, or theoretically but not practically, twelve months. The tenders were for the face value of the Treasury Notes, less a discount, which represented the interest rate. This system was replaced by a computerised system by the Debt Management Office, which is an executive agency of HM Treasury, and the last Treasury Notes were printed in September 2003. These notes would often get traded to other banks, so they did circulate; this was done without the Bank of England's knowledge, and the notes would be redeemed by the Bank of England on their date of maturity by the bearer. This circulating nature of the notes led to the robbery on 2 May 1990, of John Goddard, a messenger for the money broker Sheppards, with £292 million in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit having been stolen.

He gained a following in 2017 after posting clips of himself singing and performing covers on YouTube and Instagram. His first independent single, \\"Used To Be\\", was written by Mitchell at age 13 and has over 60 million streams. Mitchell has three songs which have reached the top 40 on the US radio charts, the July 2018 release \\"Girls\\", which reached No. 39, the March 2019 release \\"All My Friends\\", which reached No. 24, and \\"Slow Dance\\" (featuring Ava Max), which broke into the Top 40 charts in October 2019. == Early life == AJ Mitchell was born in Belleville, Illinois on May 17, 2001. His mother, Allison Mitchell, is a small business owner and his father, Aaron Fredrick Mitchell Sr, is a traveling nurse. AJ is the couple's only son and youngest child, after their daughters Andrea and Addison (Addy). Mitchell began piano lessons at 4, inspired by his father who was also learning to play piano and write songs. Mitchell attended Belleville West High School, where he played on the football team and sang in the school choir. == Career == === 2015–2016: Career beginnings === By 13, Mitchell began performing at local open-mic nights in his hometown and posting covers on YouTube and Instagram, which helped him gain a significant following. Mitchell's social media fan base helped him capture the attention of the LA-based artist manager that Mitchell has worked with since 2015. Mitchell's videos on social media granted him an opportunity to relocate to Los Angeles in 2015 to collaborate with internet marketing agency Team 10. After a brief period together, Mitchell left the group to focus his energy entirely on music. === 2017–2018: Hopeful === In 2017, Mitchell released his first independent single \\"Used to Be\\", a song he wrote at age 13. The song was produced by hip-hop producer and engineer Mike Dean. \\"Used to Be\\" has now gained over 60 million streams. After departing the social media group, Mitchell received interest from many different record labels but eventually decided to sign with Epic Records. He inked his first major deal with the label in February 2018. Mitchell's first studio EP with Epic, Hopeful, was released in July 2018. Its lead single \\"Girls\\", co-written by Mitchell and Romans, reached No. 39 on the US Mediabase pop radio chart. In November 2018, Billboard and Vevo named AJ one of the top 19 artists to watch in 2019. AJ is headlining his first US tour in spring 2019. Epic Records CEO Sylvia Rhone referred to Mitchell's music as \\"exciting things to come\\", when discussing the growing talent roster at the record label. In 2018, Mitchell collaborated with Bay Area R&B; singer-songwriter Marteen for the song \\"No Plans\\". Marteen later joined Mitchell in a support slot on the following year's 2019 Hopeful Tour. === 2019–present: Slow Dance and Skyview=== In May 2019, Mitchell collaborated with songwriting duo Teamwork and Scottish singer- songwriter Nina Nesbitt on the song \\"After Hours\\". Later that month, in an interview with Billboard, Mitchell announced that his forthcoming debut full- length album with Epic Records was nearly finished and would be released \\"very, very soon\\". The mid-tempo single \\"All My Friends\\", which debuted on the radio charts in April 2019, was confirmed as the first single from the album, titled Skyview. On August 23, 2019, Mitchell released his second EP Slow Dance, which includes his singles \\"Talk So Much\\", \\"Move On\\", and the title track featuring American singer Ava Max. == Artistry == === Musician === Mitchell cites a wide variety of music as influential to his songwriting style, regularly noting his admiration of artists like Bruno Mars and Lil Wayne. == Discography == ===Albums=== ====Studio albums==== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  +List of studio albums, with release date and label shown !

K-111's southern terminus is at F Street at the Kanopolis city limits, and the northern terminus is at K-156 northeast of the city of Ellsworth. Along the way it intersects K-140 north of Kanopolis. K-111 travels through mostly flat rural farmlands south of K-140, and small rolling hills covered with grasslands north of K-140. It is a two-lane highway its entire length. When K-111 was first designated a state highway on September 28, 1948, as a short spur between Kanopolis and U.S. Route 40 (US-40), which is modern K-140. On October 13, 1967, US-40 was rerouted to overlap the newly constructed section of I-70 from Dorrance to Salina. At that time K-111 was extended northward to US-156, which is modern K-156. Then on November 27, 1968, old US-40 from Ellsworth eastward to Salina was designated K-140. In an October 13, 1979 AASHTO meeting, it was approved to remove US-156 as a U.S. highway. Then on April 4, 1981, US-156 was redesignated as K-156. ==Route description== K-111 begins at the Kanopolis city limits as a continuation of F Street. As it leaves the city, K-111 curves north and travels through flat rural farmlands. It continues northward and soon crosses over an unnamed creek that is bordered by trees. The highway continues a little over through more farmland before reaching an intersection with K-140. K-140 heads west to Ellsworth and east to Salina. As K-111 continues north, the landscape transitions to rolling hills mixed with grasslands and some farmlands. After roughly it begins to parallel to the east of East Spring Creek, a tributary of Spring Creek which flows into Smoky Hill River. The river then passes under the highway about later and continues to parallel it. K-111 continues north for roughly through rolling hills covered with grasslands then crosses East Spring Creek again. It then continues another roughly before reaching its northern terminus at K-156. K-156 heads west to Ellsworth and east to I-70 and US-40. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 225 vehicles per day slightly north of the junction with K-140 to 465 vehicles per day slightly south of the junction with K-140. K-111 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-111 does connect to the National Highway System at its northern terminus at K-156. The entire route is paved with partial design bituminous pavement. ==History== ===Early roads=== Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. K-111 intersects K-140, which follows the Golden Belt Highway. ===Establishment and realignments=== K-111 was first designated a state highway by KDOT, at the time State Highway Commission of Kansas, on September 28, 1948. At that time it ran from US-40 (modern K-140) southward and ended at the Kannapolis city limits. On October 13, 1967, US-40 was rerouted to overlap the newly constructed section of I-70 from Dorrance to Salina. At that time K-111 was extended northward to US-156, now K-156. Then on November 27, 1968, old US-40 from Ellsworth eastward to Salina was designated K-140 and K-141 was truncated to end at the new K-140. In an October 13, 1979 AASHTO meeting, it was approved to remove US-156 as a U.S. highway. Then in an April 4, 1981 resolution, US-156 was redesignated as K-156 by KDOT. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 111 Category:Transportation in Ellsworth County, Kansas ","title":"K-111 (Kansas highway)"},{"id":"60264406","text":"Good Guys is an urban fantasy novel by the American writer Steven Brust published in 2018. It is about a fictional society in which magic exists, which is dominated by a magic-regulating bureaucracy, The Foundation. The Foundation requests paperwork for even the smallest actions, and characters in the novel are trapped in lengthy procedural investigations. ==Setting== The book takes place at roughly the time of publication. A small minority of people have the inborn ability to work magic. Many such sorcerers formed an organization, the Roma Vindices Mystici, whose members are pledged to mutual defense and do not enforce their will on fellow members. In 1931 some Mystici split off to form a smaller organization, called the Spanish Foundation, which focuses on keeping magic secret, especially by stopping people who are using it for crime, and tries to maintain some moral standards in its work. ==Summary== Nick Nagorski, a former savings-and-loan employee and whistle- blower, is using magical artifacts to kill people in gruesome ways. His goal is to kill Paul Whittier, apparently a senior employee of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who he blames for the loss of his job and his subsequent divorce. After his first attempt to shoot Whittier was defeated by the latter's magical shield, a man Nick calls Mysterious Charlie recruited him to kill members of the Mystici who are doing evil things; Charlie told Nick killing them is necessary to remove Whittier's magical protection. Nick recounts the killings and his interactions with Charlie in the first person. However, the main story is told from the third-person point of view of Donovan Longfellow, an expert detective who works for the Foundation. He's assigned to investigate the killings with his partners, Susan Kouris, a martial-arts expert, and Marci Sullivan, a recently trained sorcerer on her first assignment. (The bureaucratic Foundation limits their budget and pays each of them only minimum wage plus some benefits.) Following various natural and supernatural clues, they come closer to identifying the killer and his motives and realize that someone in the Foundation is secretly involved in the killings. At the site of the second murder (in New York) and the third murder (near Los Angeles) they are ambushed by someone trying to kill them without magic. Susan captures both ambushers and Donovan interrogates them in his friendly style. The ambusher in California, a dishonorably discharged Special Forces soldier named Matt Castellani, asks Donovan many questions about his description of the Foundation as the good guys. He wants to join, but Donovan says his group doesn't need Matt. Matt then makes a determined effort to join, eventually reaching the Foundation's headquarters in Madrid. Donovan's supervisor, the apparently unemotional Mr. Becker (as he's always called), and the Foundation's manager of recruitment and training, William Faucheux (who Marci remembers fondly for his help during her training), interview Matt. To Becker's surprise, William rejects Matt. After five murders, Donovan and his team figure out that Nick's next victim will be Whittier. They go to Whittier's mansion, arriving just before Nick, who's supported by an unaffiliated woman sorcerer and assassin from Tamil Nadu named Shveta Tyaga and two hired thugs. In the confrontation, the thugs are killed and Marci and Susan are injured, Susan fatally. When Whittier makes a disrespectful remark, Donovan kills him. Marci magically sends Nick to Donovan's locked basement. Donovan's retired partner tells him that Becker and another sorcerer named Charles Leong had carried out a similar vigilante action, killing sorcerers who they considered evil. The Foundation stripped Becker and Charles Leong of their magical powers. They conclude that Leong is the \\"Charlie\\" behind Nick's murders. Matt, who Becker hired despite William's decision and sent too late to Whittier's mansion, joins Donovan and Marci. Since William didn't hire Matt, Donovan deduces that he's Charles's ally in the Foundation. Donovan and his team capture Charles in Atlanta and inform William, and when William and Shveta come to rescue Charles, Marci strips Shveta of her sorcerous powers and the team captures them both. The Foundation removes William's powers too. Donovan volunteers to execute Charles but frees him instead. ==Reaction== Charles de Lint recommended Good Guys because of Brust's \\"playing with genre convention\\", the \\"fresh\\" feeling of the familiar elements, \\"his quirky and engaging cast of characters\\", the \\"bright sparks\\" of magic contrasted with the bureaucracies of the Foundation and the Mystici, and the \\"delight\\" of the captivating story. Carolyn Cushman found that \\"plenty of action keeps the story moving\\". Despite her annoyance at the spelling \\"PO-lice\\" in Donovan's sections, she enjoyed Donovan's \\"irreverent tone\\" . She mentioned the \\"moral conflicts\\" and said Brust was in \\"didactic mode\\". Cory Doctorow said the book showed all of Brust's strengths. He mentioned \\"snappy dialogue\\" and \\"the large cast of characters\\" and called the book \\"a tight, thrilling detective novel by way of an urban fantasy\\". The Library Journal review said Brust did \\"a solid job of creating complex, likable characters\\" and recommended \\"this twisty and clever urban fantasy\\" to his fans and those of Connie Willis and Jim Butcher as well.

Doctorow notes that \\"the Foundation may not be on the side of righteousness\\" and \\"every one of them [the characters] believes that they are the Good Guys, even though it's clear that at least some of them aren't.\\" Cushman says, \\"Figuring out who the good guys are lies at the heart of this offbeat fantasy thriller.\\" De Lint, however, says that that is not a key point of the book, and that Donovan and his team provide a \\"moral center\\". Nevertheless, he sees \\"many ambiguous gray areas\\" and describes the assassin Nick as \\"an understandable if not entirely sympathetic character\\". ==References== Category:Urban fantasy novels Category:2018 American novels Category:2018 fantasy novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Bureaucracy in fiction Category:Novels by Steven Brust ","title":"Good Guys (Brust novel)"},{"id":"60264413","text":"Witulski is a surname.

Böhlau, Köln 2003 (e. g. Constantin's granddaughter Sabina Brătianu- Cantacuzino, Constantin's great-grandson Gheorghe Brătianu or Ion Duca) the female line of the family history goes back to the Vlădescu boyars of the Argeș County. By the end of the 18th century Constantin's father Iane (or Ene) Brătianu, a minor boyar (Șătrar), has married into the Vlădescu family. However, contrary to that, a certain Dr. Georgiyev, linguist at Oriental Academy of Vienna, claimed that Constantin Brătianu has been of Bulgarian descent and immigrated from Gorna Oryahovitsa (in the Turkish ruled Northern Bulgaria) into WallachiaThis allegation was published in 1916, just at the moment when Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria were at war with Romania. Probably, it was war propaganda to discredit the Romanian prime minister Ionel Brătianu (who was a son of Ion and grandson of Constantin Brătianu).Kölnische Zeitung (German newspaper from Cologne) from September 20, 1916: Brătianu - ein Bulgarenstämmling! not before the Russo-Turkish wars when Wallachia was temporarily occupied by the Russians. Following another Russo-Turkish war Wallachia was occupied again and the Organic Regulation was imposed there. Based on that Regulament the Russians installed a parliament-like assembly of boyars. From 1831 on Constantin Brătianu, meanwhile the wealthiest of all boyars of the county, represented Argeș in the Wallachian assembly. Additionally in 1835 he became the county administrator of Argeș and in 1839 the Wallachian prince Alexandru Dimitrie Ghica honored him with the rank of a clucer. Allegedly until that time Constantin Brătianu was \\"knowing neither how to write nor to read, barely even able to sign his name\\". (Instead of reading or writing Romanian, according to the Viennian linguist, Brătianu still spoke Bulgarian.) With his wife Anastasia (also called Anica or Sica) Tigveanu, who died in 1838 (or 1839), Constantin Brătianu had three sons and four daughters. The oldest son (Teodor) became a general. Despite their boyaric origin, the two other sons (Dumitru and Ion) founded the National Liberal Party (Partidul Național Liberal) to end the rule of the conservative boyar's party – at least until the moment, when Dumitru allied himself with the boyar's party to overthrow his brother Ion. == Annotation == == References == Category:1844 deaths Constantin Category:19th-century Romanian people Category:Honorary members of the Romanian Academy Category:18th-century births ","title":"Dincă Brătianu"},{"id":"60264587","text":"The Woman Who Dared may refer to: *The Woman Who Dared (1916 film), American film directed by George E.

It was built as an industrial ice house used to store ice for packing salmon from the Spey fishery before it was sent to market. The current structure dates from 1830, having been built to replace an older structure damaged by flooding. It is the largest surviving ice house in the United Kingdom. The building currently forms part of the Scottish Dolphin Centre. ==Description== Tugnet is the largest surviving ice house in the United Kingdom. The building consists of three long brick-vaulted chambers, each divided into two compartments, with square three-gabled elevations at either end and curving turf roofs. The chambers are mostly subterranean, with only one third of their volume apparent from the outside. The main entrance leads into the central chamber, from which the remaining five chambers can be accessed; the cobbled floors in each chamber slope towards central drainage sumps; additional higher openings in the north and east elevations served as ice chutes, allowing ice, collected in winter from pools near the shore, to be deposited into the chambers. ==History== The ice house was a part of the Tugnet salmon-fishing station that was built up in the late 18th century by the Gordon Estate, which employed some 150 people. Fish would be caught in nets strung across the mouth of the river, cleaned and processed, and then packed in ice to be transported to market in London by a fleet of boats. Several 18th-century buildings survive, including the former fish house, boiler house and the manager's dwelling, but the original ice house was destroyed in a flood in 1829, necessitating the construction of the current building, which was completed in 1830. A lintel above the main entrance, which originally showed the construction date of 1830, was altered in 1977 to show the erroneous date of 1630. The building remained in use as an ice house until 1968. In 1971 it was designated a Category A listed building. In 1981, it was converted into a museum about local wildlife and the historic salmon fishing and boat building industries. The site was later acquired by the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation, and forms part of their Scottish Dolphin Centre, which offers tours of the building as well as wildlife watching activities. == References == Category:Industrial buildings Category:Category A listed buildings in Moray Category:History of fishing ","title":"Tugnet Ice House"},{"id":"60264698","text":"Constantin \\"Bebe\\" Brătianu (1950) Constantin Constantin Ion Brătianu (born May 20,Gheorghe Buzatu, Stela Cheptea, Marusia Cirstea: Istorie si societate, vol.

She graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1943 and Master of Arts in 1945, studying anthropology under A. P. Elkin; she was awarded the University Medal and won first-class honours. Martin undertook further studies at the London School of Economics and University of Chicago, eventually receiving a Ph.D. from the Australian National University (ANU) in 1954. ==Academia== Martin lectured at the University of Sydney until the birth of her first child, after which she worked part-time and often carried out unpaid research. In 1965, she was appointed as the inaugural professor of sociology at La Trobe University. She resigned due to ill health in 1974, subsequently taking up a senior fellowship in the Research School of Social Sciences at ANU. Martin was a foundation member of the Sociological Association of Australia and New Zealand (SAANZ) in 1963 and served as the organisation's president from 1969 to 1971. She served on the social studies committee of the Australian Population and Immigration Council and was a member of the Social Welfare Commission's research advisory committee. She also contributed to several parliamentary inquiries and was a consultant to the 1974 Royal Commission into Human Relationships. In 1971, she was elected as a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia. ==Works== Martin completed her M.A. thesis on dairy farmers in New South Wales and her Ph.D. thesis on refugees in New South Wales; the latter was published in book form as Refugee Settlers (1965). She later published Community and Identity (1972) and The Migrant Presence (1978), studies of refugee groups and societal attitudes towards migrants. Two works were published posthumously – The Ethnic Dimension (1981), a collection of her research papers, and The First Wave (1985), a \\"longitudinal investigation of Australia's earliest Vietnamese refugees\\". ==Personal life== Martin married the historian Allan W. Martin in 1955; the couple had two sons, including sociologist Bill Martin. She died of cancer in 1979, aged 56. After her death the SAANZ established the Jean Martin Award for the best Australian doctoral thesis in her areas of interest. The Martin Building at La Trobe University is named in honour of Jean and Allan Martin. ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:1923 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Australian sociologists Category:Fellows of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:Australian National University alumni Category:La Trobe University faculty Category:Australian women academics Category:20th-century Australian women ","title":"Jean Martin (sociologist)"},{"id":"60264742","text":"The fifth-generation iPad Mini (stylized and marketed as iPad mini and colloquially referred to as iPad Mini 5) is a tablet computer in the iPad Mini line, designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. Announced in a press release along with the iPad Air (2019) on March 18, 2019, it was the first iPad Mini that was released without a live press event. Its predecessor, the iPad Mini 4, was discontinued on the same day. It shares a similar design to the iPad Mini 4 and features the Apple A12 Bionic chip, 64 or 256GB storage, a more modernly upgraded 7.9-inch Retina Display with support for Apple Pencil (1st Generation), True Tone display and Bluetooth 5.0. iFixit's teardown shows this iPad Mini is equipped with an upgraded 3GB of LPDDR4X RAM, the same as the iPhone XR. ==Features== ===Hardware=== The iPad Mini (2019) features the upgraded front camera system of the 7MP (1080p) camera used since 2016 starting with the iPhone 7 and continued with the iPhone XS, while the rear camera system continues with the older 8MP (1080p) used since the iPad Air 2 in 2014, so it cannot record in 4K. The iPad Mini uses a Lightning port and has a headphone jack. It has a True Tone display, which allows the LCD to adapt to ambient lighting to change its color and intensity in different environments. It also has a wide color display (Display P3 color gamut), which means it can shows more vibrant color compared to the previous generation. The Apple A12 Bionic chip powering the iPad Mini (2019) has a 66% higher clock speed than its predecessor, which had a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor; (the Apple A8 in the previous generation was clocked higher than in the iPhone 6).

Born \\"Caroline Chesebrough\\", but known by her preferred spelling of \\"Caroline Chesebro'\\", she was the founder of The Packard Quarterly. Chesebro first became known as a writer in 1848, when she was engaged as a contributor to Graham's American Monthly Magazine. Subsequently, she was connected as a sketch writer with many prominent monthly magazines and other periodicals. In 1851, she published a volume of short stories under the collective head of Dreamland by Daylight, a Panorama of Romance, and a year later, she wrote, Isa, a Pilgrimage. Victoria, or the World Overcome, a novel, followed in 1856. Chesebro' also wrote The Beautiful Gate, and Other Tales, and was an occasional contributor to some of the daily newspapers. In later years, her short stories were attractive to the readers of Harper's Magazine and The Atlantic monthlies and Appletons' Journal. Writing for two decades, her publications steadily gaining favor with the public, improvement being perceptible in the later volumes. ==Early life and education== Caroline Chesebrough was born at Canandaigua, New York, 30 March 1825. Her parents were Betsey Kimball and Nicoholas Goddard Chesebrough, hatter and postmaster. There were four older siblings and three that were younger. Her ancestors, Anne Stevenson and William Chesebrough, removed from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630), and were associated with the establishment of Braintree, Massachusetts, Rehoboth, Massachusetts, and Stonington, Connecticut. Chesebro was educated at a female seminary in her local town. ==Career== Chesebro remained in Canandaigua until 1835, when she was invited to a position in the Packer Collegiate Institute, Brooklyn. She had the charge of Composition in the higher departments of the institute, but lived with her brothers and sister at Piermont, New York on the Hudson River. For many years, Chesebro' contributed prose and verse to periodicals. Between 1848 and 1851, her stories appeared in Graham's American Monthly Magazine, Holden's Dollar Magazine, The Knickerbocker, Sartain's, Peterson's Magazine, and Godey's Lady's Book. Twenty-four of her stories appeared in Dream-Land by Daylight, A Panorama of Romance (1851, J.S. Redfield). From 1851, her stories were published in Harper's Magazine, as well as Appleton's, Beadle's, Continental, Galaxy, Lippincott's, and Putnam's, as well as, beginning in 1857, The Atlantic Monthly. Chesebro' wrote several books, among which are: Dream of Land by Day Light; Peter Carvadine; Isa, a Pilgrimage; The Children of Light; Getting Along; Victoria; and The Foe in the Household. Puy (1896) described them as, \\"evincing descriptive and analytical powers of a high order\\". ==Later years== After 1865, Chesebro' returned to teaching at Packer Collegiate Institute.

She was married to fellow writer- editor Harry H. Caldwell, with whom she often collaborated. == Biography == Katherine was born in Tacoma, Washington. Her father died when she was young, and she was raised by her stepfather (hence her sometimes being referred to as Katherine Prosser). She attended high school in Savannah, Georgia, before moving to San Francisco to begin a career as a journalist. While working at The Oakland Call, she met her first husband, Douglas \\"Bill\\" Hilliker. Hilliker was a graphic designer who was working in the fledgling motion picture industry, and after the pair married, she took an interest in the medium as well. She went to work as film critic at The New York Morning Telegraph before leaving journalism behind to work as an editor at Universal. She then moved on to work as David O. Selznick publicity chief Vivian Moses's assistant, writing publicity copy on the studio's releases. By 1916, she was writing and editing films at Select; she later worked at C.L. Chester Pictures Corporation, where she helped put together documentary-style travel shorts. While working at Chester, she met the man who would become her second husband, H.H. Caldwell. She and Clark would work on English titles for foreign releases at Samuel Goldwyn's studio.

His father was a small-farmer who became a postman. The family was politically committed. Paul Lapeyre embarked on a career as a teacher, but his anti-militarist stance and his internationalism led to his exclusion from the state education system. In November 1926, with his brothers Aristide and Laurent, he participated in the establishment of the Confédération Générale du Travail-Syndicaliste Révolutionnaire (CGT) and thereafter contributed articles to the Le Combat syndicaliste, the weekly political magazine of France's principal trades union grouping the CGT. ===The 1930s and the Spanish Civil War=== Between 1930 and 1939 he worked at \\"Lucifer\\", at times using the pseudonym \\"Paul Bordeaux\\". Lucifer was a publishing house founded by his brother in 1929. He also contributed to \\"La Révolte\\", described as the \\"anarchist organ of the (French) southwest\\". During the 1930s he also came to the fore as a campaigner and activist, appearing as an effective speaker at numerous public meetings convened in support of the 1936 Spanish Revolution. In particular, he addressed a meeting in August 1936 at the Salle Wagram (auditorium) that had been organised by the \\"Anarcho- syndicatist Committee for the defence and liberation of the Spanish people\\", which enabled him to report back on his own recent visit to Spain during what came to be identified as the opening months of the Spanish Civil War. During January - March 1937 he undertook a \\"propaganda tour\\" in Algeria under the auspices of the Confédération Générale du Travail-Syndicaliste Révolutionnaire (loosely, \\"General Confederation of Revolutionary Trade Unions\\" / CGT-SR), setting up a dozen \\"conferences\\" to support the Spanish Revolution. The three Lapeyre brothers organised networks to procure and provide armaments and medical supplies for comrades in the (Spanish) National Confederation of Labour (\\"Confederación Nacional del Trabajo\\" / CNT). Paul Lapeyre contributed to \\"L'Espagne Antifasciste\\", a periodical published in Bordeaux which at the start of 1938 merged with André Prudhommeaux's \\" L'Espagne nouvelle\\". He wrote for \\"SIA\\", the weekly publication of the French section of the \\"International antifascist solidarity\\" (\\"Solidarité internationale antifasciste\\") which had been founded and was headed up by Louis Lecoin and Nicolas Faucier as a further response to the unfolding tragedy in Spain. Lapeyre himself also made a number of further visits to Spain, mandated by the CGT-SR. In September 1938 the names of Paul Lapeyre and his brother Laurent were placed on the registry for political \\"Carnet B\\" government surveillance. ===Prisoner of war=== During 1938 and 1939 there was a growing belief that another war between France and Germany was becoming inevitable. In September 1939 the French government declared war on Germany, and a general mobilisation was implemented. At its final meeting (before it was banned) the CGT-SR) ten days earlier, had finalised plans to call a general strike in the event of a general mobilisation, but those plans appear not to have survived the reality of the German and Soviet invasions of Poland. Paul Lapeyre was among those conscripted to join the army in August/September 1939. He hesitated for several days before reporting to the barracks at Auch. He was sent to Alsace, which had been reincorporated into France in 1919, and spent several months on the banks of the Rhine. It was presumably in the context of the German invasion of France, which took place during May and June 1940, that the regiment in which Lapeyre was serving found itself surrounded and obliged to surrender. Now German prisoners of war, Lapeyre and his comrades were held in their barracks for slightly more than a month before being transferred to a large farm and set to work at Hoisdorf, some 25 km (16 miles) to the east of Hamburg. An escape attempt failed. Lapeyre spent the next five years in a succession of four labour camps. At one point he narrowly avoided being sent to the notorious death camp at Rava-Ruska, but in the end he was sent back to the Hamburg region where he worked alongside the other prisoners of war. During a week in July 1943 \\"allied\\" bomb attacks completely destroyed the saw mill to which he had been assigned. In the end, however, he was liberated by the English (\\"... par les Anglais\\") in June 1945. ===New beginnings=== After the liberation Paul Lapeyre re-established links with others who had been CGT- SR activists before 1939, such as Julien Toublet and Pierre Besnard. Along with his brother Aristide he was part of the little team representing the Bordeaux region at the congress in Paris of 6/7 October 1945 which marked the birth of the new \\"Fédération anarchiste\\" (FA). He also took part in the congress of 7-9 December 1945 which established the National Confederation of Labour - French section (\\"Confédération nationale du travail (France)\\" / CNTF), which was a continuation of the pre-war CNT (no longer able to operate in Francoist Spain). Just as before the war, the inspiration of Pierre Besnard played a defining role. Lapeyre then became secretary of the Bordeaux regional union and of the \\"8th regional union\\" of the CNTF). There followed several years during which Lapeyre was involved in breakaway attempts involving the CNTF) and other groups in the Bordeaux region to break away from the CGT failed to gain significant traction on the national stage. At the end of May 1952 a (FA) congress was held at Bordeaux at which Paul Lapeyre was one of several prominently dissident members excluded from membership. Others were his brother Aristide, Maurice Joyeux, Maurice Fayolle, André Arru and Georges Vincey. This was part of a wider process by which Georges Fontenis was pushing the (FA) towards becoming what sources identify as a \\"communist libertarian federation\\" (une \\"Fédération communiste libertaire\\"). Shortly after this George Fontenis renamed what remained of the Anarchist Federation, which now became the Libertarian Communist Federation (FCL). Between 25 and 27 December 1953 Paul Lapeyre took part in the congress at Paris which reconstructed the \\"Fédération anarchiste\\" (FA) on a more broadly based Synthesis anarchism basis, starting with those recently excluded from the federation and former militants who had simply left the old FA during the preceding years, alienated by what they saw as a continuing communist libertarian drift. The basic principals of the reconstructed federation were drawn to try and incorporate the largest number of anarchists, irrespective of the strands within the overall movement to which they adhered. It was in reality a challenging aspiration. Maurice Joyeux who had taken the initiative of setting up a replacement Anarchist Federation, found himself obliged to make compromises with individualistic anarchists which taken in aggregate led to an operating structure that Joyaux himself found \\"impossible\\". The requirement that decisions be adopted on a unanimous basis meant that each individual member enjoyed the right to veto any attempt to set a direction for the federation. ===Last years=== At he start of the 1970s an infarction obliged Lapeyre to withdraw from active political involvement, and he retired to Barsac, Gironde. He died on 2 May 1991 in a hospital at Burela, following an automobile accident in Galicia (northwest Spain). ==Publications (selection)== ==Notes== ==References== Category:People from Gers Category:1901 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Libertarian socialists Category:French anarchists Category:Members of the General Confederation of Labour (France) Category:Members of the French Anarchist Federation ","title":"Paul Lapeyre"},{"id":"60264920","text":"The Sower () is a Canadian documentary film, directed by Julie Perron and released in 2013.\\"Julie Perron dans Le semeur: héros de la biodiversité végétale\\".

At around midday, local time, an asteroid roughly 10 meters in diameter entered the atmosphere at a speed of , with a TNT equivalent energy of 173 kilotons, more than 10 times the energy of the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The object entered at a steep angle of 7 degrees, close to the zenith, terminating in an air burst at an altitude of around . ==Overview== Approximate sizes of the Kamchatka object, Chelyabinsk asteroid, and the Tunguska object relative to a human. Based on the energy and velocity of the impact, the asteroid had a mass of 1600 tonnes and a diameter of between 10 and 14 meters (32 to 45 feet) depending on its density. The impact was announced around 8 March 2019, and is the largest asteroid to impact Earth since the 20-meter Chelyabinsk meteor's entry in February 2013, and the third largest recorded meteor since 1900 after that and the Tunguska event. NASA's Terra satellite and the Japanese Meteorological Agency's Himawari 8 recorded the dust trail from the event, although their observation interval was too long to image the air burst itself. The dominant period of the CTBTO infrasound was very long, on the order of 20 to 25 seconds corresponding to energies on the order of 100 to 200 kilotons. The shockwave was strong enough to have cracked windows if the shockwave had been over a populated region. Even though it was only six years after the previous one, events as large as this are statistically estimated to occur only once every few decades on average. As of January 2017, over 723,000 asteroids were being tracked in the solar system, with more discovered, lost and recovered daily. Since 2011, on average, 80 new minor planets of diameter 30–50 meters or more are discovered each day. As of March 2019, 724 (roughly one in a thousand) are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA).

Instead a \\"super coach\\" serving in similar series in another country would be invited to help the coaches and their contestants in preparing their songs in the period following the blind auditions. Also, four personalities would become \\"honorary members\\" of each team, and would prepare a joint song with their respective teams during the final. The honorary members were Corey Hart on Éric Lapointe's team,Richard Therrien, \\"«La voix»: un premier blocage et Corey Hart\\". Le Droit, February 10, 2019.

It stars Scott Eastwood, Caleb Landry Jones, Orlando Bloom, Jack Kesy, Cory Hardrict, Milo Gibson, Jacob Scipio and Taylor John Smith. The film was scheduled to premiere at the 2020 South by Southwest Film Festival, but the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released via Premium VOD, as well as in selected theaters, on July 3, 2020. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the battle sequences and respectful depiction of the soldiers. ==Background== In 2006, PRT Kamdesh – later renamed Combat Outpost Keating – was one of several U.S. Army outposts established in Northern Afghanistan. Located in a remote valley surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains, the base was regarded as a deathtrap; the troops stationed there faced regular Taliban attacks, culminating in one of the bloodiest American engagements of Operation Enduring Freedom. The film tells the story of the 53 U.S. soldiers and two Latvian military advisors who battled some 400 enemy insurgents at the Battle of Kamdesh. == Plot == During the war in Afghanistan, SSG Romesha and a new group of soldiers arrive at PRT Kamdesh, under the command of CPT Keating. SGT Scusa saves a dog from being shot, and the men fend off yet another Taliban attack. SSG Gallegos assaults PFC Yunger for firing too close to his head, while SGT Larson reprimands SPC Carter for arguing during the firefight. Keating arranges a shura to offer local elders money for infrastructure projects in exchange for peace. A gunshot residue test proves that a local man took part in the previous day’s attack, but he and others lay down their arms. Keating offers to drive a large LMTV through the narrow mountain roads; while Romesha and Carter scout ahead, the vehicle falls off a cliff, killing Keating. The new commanding officer, CPT Yllescas, sends out a patrol after another attack; Romesha details how he would mount an assault on the vulnerable outpost. SGT Kirk apprehends a local man paid by the elders to take pictures of the base, which leads Yllescas to withhold the money Keating promised them. The base’s Afghan interpretor, Mohammed, warns of an impending large-scale attack, but his fears are dismissed. Patrolling a bridge with Yunger, Yllescas is killed by a bomb; the traumatized Yunger is talked out of suicide by Romesha. CPT Broward takes charge of the base, which he reveals will soon be closed. An Afghan ID is found near by the bridge, presumably belonging to the bomber, but Broward refuses to allow Romesha and the men to search the nearby villages. Romesha clashes with Broward over the captain’s strict adherence to the rules of engagement, and pressure from Afghan President Karzai postpones the closing of the base. Carter approaches 1LT Bundermann with the men’s concern about Broward’s leadership, but is rebuffed. A nighttime attack reveals the insurgents now have mortars. The next day, elders arrive with the body of a girl they fraudulently claim was killed by the American counterattack; Broward agrees to compensate them, and shoots Scusa’s dog for biting an elder. As the troops blow off steam by waterboarding each other, Broward reveals he has been relieved of command and the base will officially close in October. Left in command, Bundermann orders the men not to send any communication about leaving the base, as the soldiers make calls to their loved ones. On the morning of October 3rd, 2009, Mohammed alerts the base that the villagers are gone and hundreds of Taliban fighters have surrounded the outpost. A firefight erupts, sending the Afghan National Army forces fleeing, and PFC Thomson and Scusa are killed. Gallegos and several others are pinned down inside an armored vehicle, and Romesha is wounded trying to reach them. Learning Kirk has been killed, Romesha eliminates a Taliban sniper. SGT Hardt, SPC Griffin, and PVT Faulkner try to reach Gallegos’ position, but their vehicle becomes stuck as they realize the Taliban have breached the perimeter. Griffin and Hardt are killed, and Romesha reaches the TOC and convinces Bundermann they should retake the base. Larson and Carter lay down covering fire, allowing the others to escape from the armored vehicle. Gallegos and SSG Martin are killed, and despite taking heavy gunfire, Carter rescues wounded SPC Mace. Romesha leads a group of men to successfully secure the front gate, just as air support arrives. As a B-1 bomber drops its payload on the Taliban’s position, Carter and Larson carry Mace to the aid station, where CPT Cordova uses fresh blood from himself and others to transfuse Mace. CPT Portis and a quick reaction force arrive, dispatching the last of the insurgents. The remaining soldiers leave by helicopter as the base is demolished, and learn Mace did not survive. The Battle of Khamdesh left 27 Americans wounded and 8 dead, and Romesha and Carter each received the Medal of Honor, members of what became the most decorated unit of the war. ==Cast== * Marin Rangelov as Nasir (Taliban Spy) Three people who served at the actual outpost appear in the movie: Ty Carter appears in a cameo role; Henry Hughes appears in a supporting role as Brad Larson, and SPC Daniel Rodriguez appears as himself. ==Production== After Paul Tamasy acquired the rights to Jake Tapper's book, he and his writing partner, Eric Johnson, sold the project as a pitch to Universal Pictures with Scott Stuber also attached to produce. While negotiating their deal, Sam Raimi expressed interest in directing the project. Paul made the difficult decision to leave Universal and develop the project with Raimi. After Raimi decided he no longer wanted to direct, Paul Tamasy, along with former Ghost House development executive Paul Merryman attached Rod Lurie, West Point graduate- turned-film critic and director, to direct the screenplay. The film was officially announced alongside the casting of Eastwood and Bloom in May 2018, and in August Milo Gibson joined the cast. Because Clint Romesha had written a book on the conflict that had in-turn been optioned by Sony Pictures, the producers rushed to get The Outpost made, and contact between Romesha and Eastwood (who depicts him in the film) was limited after a legal letter from the studio. Three weeks before filming was set to begin, Eastwood broke his ankle, causing a two-week delay, rewrites, and re-choreographing of the fight sequences. Filming took place mostly in Bulgaria, wrapping in mid-October 2018. ==Release== In October 2019, a rough edit of The Outpost was screened for the depicted soldiers and their families in Washington, D.C., which Stoney Portis, who was the commander of the unit at the time, called \\"part of the healing.\\" The film was then scheduled to premiere on March 14, 2020 at the South by Southwest Film Festival. However, the festival was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, Screen Media Films acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released via Premium VOD and in selected theaters on July 3, 2020. Fathom Events originally planned on releasing the film on 500 screens theatrically from July 2–5, but the plans were scrapped due to the pandemic; it did still release in 69 theaters. It made $14,182 in its debut weekend. ==Reception== === VOD sales === In its debut weekend, The Outpost was the top-rented film on the iTunes Store and FandangoNow, and reportedly was the best debut in Screen Media's history. It remained the number one film on iTunes in its second weekend, as well as on AppleTV, while finishing second at FandangoNow and on Spectrum's weekly chart. The film continued to do well in its third week of release, finishing first at Apple TV and Spectrum and second on FandangoNow. It remained in the top six across all services in the subsequent weeks. === Critical response === On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 86 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Told with gripping realism, The Outpost is a thrilling technical feat and a worthy tribute to military heroes.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Debruge, in his review for Variety, called the film a \\"harrowing immersive account\\" of the battle and wrote: \\"The Outpost isn't glamorous, but it's respectful of the sacrifice and split-second decision-making that Bravo Troop faced, amplifying the terror of such an impossible assignment by attempting to mirror the characters' point of view.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B\\" and called it \\"familiar but uncommonly visceral\\", writing that \\"Lurie does a strong job of threading the needle between excitement and calamity; shooting much of the 45-minute long ambush in hectic, agile long- takes allows him to capture the Battle of Kamdesh for all of its terror, and with a clarity that allows us to feel that terror in our bones.\\" The film was praised by veterans, including those who fought in the battle, for its realistic depiction of warfare, everyday soldier life, and the looks of the base. ==See also== * Ty Carter * Clinton Romesha * Battle of Kamdesh * Combat Outpost Keating * List of post-Vietnam War Medal of Honor recipients * List of living Medal of Honor recipients ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Rod Lurie Category:American war drama films Category:Bulgarian war films Category:Bulgarian drama films Category:Films about battles and military operations Category:Films about the United States Army Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films set in 2006 Category:Films set in 2009 Category:Films set in Afghanistan Category:Films shot in Bulgaria Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:War films based on actual events Category:War in Afghanistan (2001–present) films Category:American films ","title":"The Outpost (2020 film)"},{"id":"60264990","text":"Daniel Dale (born March 28, 1985) is a Canadian journalist who served as the Toronto Stars Washington bureau chief from 2015 to 2019.

An anime television series adaptation by Madhouse aired from October 10 to December 26, 2019. The first season was a split-cour anime, with the second half being scheduled for April 2020, before being delayed to air from July 9 to September 24, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Plot== In the near future, many humans have become cyborgs called . However, with a great war having recently ended, many Extended, who are former soldiers, begin to resort to crime to survive. Juzo Inui is a \\"Resolver,\\" an Extended mercenary who specializes in solving problems caused by other Extended. However, Juzo's life is turned upside down when a renegade Extended breaks into his office, pleading for him to protect a young boy named Tetsurō Arahabaki. ==Characters== ; : :An amnesiac private detective who works as a \\"Resolver,\\" taking on cases relating to Extended and priding himself on always seeing a case to completion. His distinguishing feature is that his head is a giant functioning handgun, specifically a revolver, the trademark trait of the Gun Slave Unit model of Over-Extended used in the war. However, he is unable to fire it himself and requires someone else to do so, only granting the privilege to people he trusts out of a desire to not become a \\"tool.\\" His head gun is immensely powerful, firing a large beam that can easily destroy even the strongest Extended. His personal motto is \\"wipe your own ass,\\" a belief that one should deal with their own problems without relying on others. He expresses distaste for children and humidity, out of fear his head will rust, and has no memory of his life before becoming an Extended. Juzo is a habitual chain smoker, preferring the Tanegashima brand for their taste. His cigarettes are actually a specially-formulated medication for Extended which dulls the pain from nerve damage stemming from Extensions. Juzo was once known as \\"Device #13,\\" the last of 13 Gun Slave Units produced during the war and one of only four confirmed to still be alive in the present day. His former Hands partner, an unnamed man with Japanese ancestry, is the one who gave him the name , which literally means \\"thirteen\\" in Japanese. His body is equipped with a number of powerful hidden features and weapons that can normally only be activated with the authorization of someone with a Hands Extension, though Juzo is able to forcefully activate some of these features on his own with some effort. However, doing so is dangerous, as it puts great strain on his body and mind as he fights against his limiter programming and he is generally unwilling to do so anyway unless given no other option. His onboard combat program automatically activates a restricted battle mode whenever he is in significant danger, unlocking some of his body's features and increasing his combat potential at the cost of suppressing his consciousness and sending him into a berserker state where he attacks anything his program deems a threat. His primary weapon is a revolver-like device embedded in his right hand that allows him to fire a powerful concussive punch known as (German for \\"Spark Fist\\"). ; : :The teenage son of Berühren Corp CEO Soichiro Arahabaki. He has been experimented on and possesses a device known as \\"Harmony\\" implanted in his throat, which allows him to control Extended bodies from a distance as if they were his own and unlock an Extension's full potential. The tendons in his arms and legs as well as his vocal cords have been severed, making him incapable of moving or speaking on his own. Mary later provides him with wearable Extensions that allow him to walk and use his arms again and he uses Harmony with a discarded Extended head to speak. Because of the torture he received at Berühren Corp, he has lost significant portions of his memory, particularly the fact that he once allied himself with the anti-Extended organization Spitzbergen and funded their operations. ; : :An associate of Juzo's, a young woman who performs back-alley maintenance on Extended in the mafia-controlled Kyusei Pit immigrant district, one of the few places in the city not under Berühren Corp control. She provides Juzo with medicated cigarettes after he loses access to his favorite brand. She and her brother Victor were orphans taken in by an engineer named Emmett. Mary became a mechanic hoping to reunite with her mechanic brother Victor who went missing during the war. She eventually installs an Extension on herself that replaces her breasts with two missile launchers, which noticeably increase her bust size when loaded. ; : :The director of EMS, a branch of the Reconstruction Agency tasked with enforcing Extended law and regulating Over-Extended. She has granted Juzo some leniency and autonomy despite the Over-Extended laws in exchange for him performing the occasional under-the-table job for her. She wears distinctive blue lipstick and carries a can of surströmming on her person at all times as a memento of her father. ; : :An EMS section chief and staunch believer in EMS' duty towards enforcing Extended regulations. He distrusts all Extended, especially Over-Extended like Juzo, believing them to be no more than unstable machines. His weapons of choice are thrown needles, which he embeds in pressure points to disable Extensions. ; : :Acting director of EMS following Olivier's suspension. Despite his attitude towards Extensions, he possesses an Extension that lines his skin with sensors he relates to ampullae of Lorenzini, allowing him to detect electrical impulses around him. ; : :A representative of Spitzbergen, a quasi-religious organization that opposes all Extensions, seeing them as an affront against God. He is wheelchair-bound and has a severely weakened body. His brother Lawrence was a high achiever who eventually joined the military during the war, but lost both legs when the train transporting him to his first posting derailed, leaving him extremely bitter. Wachowski dedicated himself to research and is known as the father of Extension technology for his extensive contribution to developing the first generation of Extensions. He was employed as an engineer by Berühren Corp, which was originally formed purely for research and development into Extension technology to help humanity. He believes that the company misused his technology and accuses the senior officers of the company, a group known as Wurzel (from German, meaning \\"root\\") consisting of Chief Science Officer (CSO) Strange, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Dreamy, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Timid, and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Honest, of changing its objectives into a means of allowing the aging Wurzel to achieve immortality. ; : :A Berühren Corp agent who is Seven's handler and the younger sister of Karen. Pepper's right forearm is an Extension known as a Hands Unit, which resembles a large mechanical hand with a revolver cylinder replacing the forearm. This Extension allows Pepper to unlock a Gun Slave Unit's full function by pulling the trigger mechanism on their back. Her weapon of choice is a large cleaver, which she uses whenever Seven is otherwise unable to defend her. Pepper's body is generally incompatible with Extension technology, meaning she was considered worthless to Berühren Corp until showing compatibility with the Hands Unit and the ability to tame Seven, who was once a notoriously temperamental Gun Slave Unit. To that end, she considers herself Seven's \\"owner.\\" Pepper is not her real name, as she was stripped of everything that belonged to her, including her former identity, once she was taken in by Berühren Corp as a young girl. ; : :A Gun Slave Unit partnered with Pepper and working for Berühren Corp. Seven has a personality much like a young boy and is often seen eating lollipops, which serve the same function as Juzo's cigarettes. Unlike Juzo's head, which resembles a revolver, Seven's head more closely resembles a modern semi- automatic handgun. His right hand is a three-pronged claw appendage containing a powerful shotgun-like cannon that fires a mass of pellets known as Sturm Faust (German for \\"Storm Fist.\\") Seven was formerly known as \\"Device #7,\\" an unstable berserker imprisoned by Berühren Corp until \\"tamed\\" by Pepper. He shows absolute devotion to Pepper, seeing himself as \\"hers\\" and showing irritation when she expresses interest in \\"owning\\" Juzo. ; : :A member of Spitzbergen and former associate of Kronen von Wolf. He expresses a similar distaste for Extended and arms himself with a golden revolver that can fire needles into pressure points. ; : :Chief of security at Berühren Corp and an enforcer tasked with retrieving Tetsurō. He operates under the fanatical belief that people are replaceable cogs in a machine that exists only to serve Berühren Corp. ; : :A high level Berühren Corp operative who held Tetsurō captive, posing as a nun. She is the older sister of Pepper. Her Extensions include an artificial eye that assists her in aiming her double-barreled revolver ; : :Juzo's overbearing and doting landlord. ; : :A neighbor of Juzo and daughter of an elderly barber who cleans and services Juzo's head. She has a notable stutter and seems to have a crush on Juzo. ; : :Also known as \\"Armed Sai,\\" Tokisada is a popular celebrity considered a hero by the public for being the first person to undergo full-body Extension during the war. Tokisada is one of two still-living members of Tindalos, a group recognized as the first generation of Extended, the other being Hayden Gondry. Tokisada's Extensions, which include a large number of built-in weapons (hence the nickname \\"Mega Armed\\"), served as test prototypes for equipment later installed in other full-body models like the Gun Slave Units, including the same Funke Faust hand weapon. ; : :An Over-Extended fugitive and former member of Tindalos who escapes from EMS while being transported to a Berühren Corp facility. Hayden is infamous for being the perpetrator of the Nightmare of Norse Scott, an incident where he murdered several people, including many of his wartime squad mates and Olivier's father, before being apprehended. Many details about the incident, including the fact that his rampage was caused by dangerous Extension experiments performed on the Tindalos members, were covered up over the years to preserve the public's opinion on Extension technology. Gondry's Over-Extended body is specifically designed for stealthy assassinations and is only vaguely humanoid, featuring a head with two faces mounted on thin limbs and a cloak of light-refracting camouflage plates, which allow him to cloak and disguise himself. ; : :A young immigrant man who has illegal extensions so that he can work at construction sites to support his family. He agreed to work for Spitzbergen to make enough money to pay for surgery on his mother who suffered nerve damage through a defective Berühren extension. ; : :An old man with Extended eyes capable of image analysis using the Multiple Alternative Light Sources (MALS) system which utilizes ultraviolet and infrared light to construct images for evidence. He was an analyst at the Security Department but was dismissed for misusing his ability to illegally take pictures of women's underwear and then selling them. ; : :Mary's older brother, a former Extended engineer who is now a sadistic Over- Extended serial killer known as the \\"Dismantler\\" due to his ability to quickly and expertly destroy Extended bodies. He was Juzo's personal engineer during the war and later gave Juzo his first job as a Resolver: protect Mary. He is aligned with Spitzbergen despite the organization's staunch anti-Extended views. It is later revealed that the Dismantler is merely a \\"shadow\\" of the real Victor's personality existing in an experimental sub-brain he developed. The \\"shadow\\" took control after Victor was traumatized by the brutality the Extensions he created caused in the war, using remote bodies to operate under the real Victor's subconscious desire to destroy all Extension technology. Victor's real body, including the experimental sub-brain, exists in an unknown location. ; : :An Over-Extended with a motorcycle headlight and handlebars for a head. He saved Emma Kurtz from committing suicide over the death of her fiancé, Theodore, who was apparently killed in an explosion while in a bomb disposal unit after the war. Edmund and Emma were married, but after having a new arm Extension fitted, Edmund disappeared planning to kill his former partner, a Gun Slave Unit named Five, who he believed was hunting him. His arm Extension is a powerful electrical generator, which he uses in combination with a club weapon that embeds conductive needles in whatever it strikes. ==Media== ===Manga=== The manga series has been published in Shueisha's seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump since August 2014.

This was a common practice among the heirs of wealthy planters in the British Caribbean, and was usually a clause that needed to be fulfilled in order to inherit their slave plantations in the West Indies. == Early life == Drax was educated at Eton College from 1706 to 1707 and was admitted at Magdalene College, Cambridge on 15 May 1710, aged 16. He married his first cousin, Elizabeth Ernle, daughter of Sir Edward Ernle, 3rd Baronet before 23 December 1719. She was the heiress of the Erle and Ernle families, by whom he obtained Charborough House and an electoral interest at Wareham. Charborough House == Political career == Drax was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Wareham at a by-election on 28 March 1718, after General Thomas Erle, his wife's grandfather, vacated the seat. He voted against the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts and the Peerage Bill in 1719. In 1720 he was one of the Members who were credited with £1,000 stock by the South Sea Company without paying for it. He did not stand for Wareham at the 1722 British general election when his father-in-law, Sir Edward Ernle, took the family seat. At the 1727 British general election he was returned as MP for Lyme Regis. After voting with the Government on the Hessians in 1730, he then voted with the Opposition. He was returned again for Wareham at the 1734 British general election and was appointed to the stewardship of the Prince of Wales's Dorset manors in 1737. He became ‘a great favourite’ with the Prince and entertained him at Charborough in 1741. At the 1741 British general election was returned at Wareham after making a compromise with John Pitt, whose family also held an interest there. In 1744 he replaced George Lyttelton as the Prince of Wales’ secretary, although Horace Walpole claimed he could not write his own name. Next year his daughter Elizabeth, who had married Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley, was appointed lady of the bedchamber to the Princess of Wales. At the 1747 British general election, breaking the compromise, he was returned for Wareham with his eldest son, Thomas Erle Drax, against John Pitt, but they were both unseated on petition on 26 January 1748. When Pitt changed his seat in 1751, Henry Drax was returned in his place at a by-election on 25 January 1751. On the Prince's death in 1751 he lost his place and the prospect of a barony and went over to the Pelhams.

It is found in the North Atlantic Ocean. It burrows into soft sediment on the seabed, mostly in deep water. ==Description== The female Maxmuelleria lankesteri is broadly cylindrical and grows to a length of about , and a width of . It has a proboscis which is nearly as long as the body. The proboscis is scoop-shaped with a truncated tip, but does not divide in two parts. There are a pair of large chaetae (bristles) on the under side of the body just posterior to the proboscis and the genital groove is obscure. Both body and proboscis are green. The morphology of the male is not known. ==Distribution and habitat== M. lankesteri is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Its range includes the Kattegat, the Skagerrak, the western coast of Scotland and the Irish Sea. It is mainly a deep sea species, burrowing in soft sediment. ==Ecology== This species makes a large semi-permanent burrow in sandy or muddy sediment. There is often a mound of sediment up to high by the single, funnel- shaped entrance to the burrow, and there is some evidence that a second entrance exists. Immediately below the entrance is a circular constriction with smooth walls, but beyond this the tunnel becomes wider and gradually becomes more horizontal. It may descend as deep as below the surface. Other animals are often found living symbiotically in the burrow, including polychaete worms and bivalve molluscs. Several species of goby may also live near the entrance and made their own modifications to the burrow, as also does the crustacean Jaxea nocturna. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Echiurans Category:Animals described in 1897 Category:Taxa named by William Abbott Herdman ","title":"Maxmuelleria lankesteri"},{"id":"60265904","text":"James Harlan is a bronze sculpture of American attorney and politician of the same name by Nellie Walker, formerly installed in Washington, D.C.'s United States Capitol, as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.

He then spent ten years farming his father's estates along with his brother Samuel Williamson Wallace (1855–1932) who became director of agriculture for the state of Victoria in Australia in 1902. From 1882 to 1885 he began to teach at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester and served as a Professor of Agriculture.

Wallace was Garton Lecturer on Colonial and Indian Agriculture (1900-1922) which helped spread his reputation across the colonies. Wallace travelled widely, to Italy and India in 1887, the latter resulting in a book India in 1887 in which he examined livestock farming and agriculture in India. Wallace travelled to India in an unofficial capacity, with a special interest in livestock. He took numerous photographs and several notes were published in scholarly societies. Communicating with Thomas Henry Huxley, he speculated on the skin colours of Indian cattle, commenting that they were predominantly dark skinned and suggested that they may have been selected for the same underlying but unexplained mechanism leading to darker human skin colour in the tropics. He travelled to the United States thrice between 1890 and 1898 with trips to Egypt (1891), Greece (1892) and South Africa (1895) in the same period.

He was educated at the King's School, Chester and worked as a pharmacist. He married Eliza Hope and emigrated to South Australia aboard Rajah, arriving in April 1850. In September he was appointed to the Pulteney Street school as under-master to E. K. Miller. He then ran an Education Department school at Saddleworth before in June 1853 accepting the position of headmaster of the school (established 1850) attached to St George's (Anglican) Church, Gawler. St. George's School, on the north side of Orleana Square, operated on a non-denominational basis in order to qualify for Government assistance; a separate room for girls was added in 1857, and a new school building was erected around 1865. Under Burton's stewardship the school gained a high reputation and attracted students from far afield. In 1869 he taught at the Gawler Academy, conducted by Rev. Thomas Smellie. With the Education Act of 1875, small private schools such as St George's were put under competition from State schools, and Burton accepted headmastership of the new Gawler Model School, and St George's folded.

Known within Israel for her role of Daffi in the 2014 film Zero Motivation, she gained international acclaim in 2016 for portraying Nana Milch-Kotler in \\"Past Life\\", directed by Avi Nesher. Tagar is famous for often playing roles of characters much younger than her in real life, by virtue of her juvenile appearance. ==Early life== Tagar was born on 30 November 1982, to lawyers Tiva and Rafi Tagar, who immigrated from Bulgaria prior to her birth. She was named after her paternal grandmother. She grew up in Ramat Gan. She had her first movie role in 1993, portraying a battered child in Dan Wolman's short film \\"Haverot\\". After the film achieved august success, Wolman went on to pick Tagar for more roles in his films, triggering her acting career. In 2000, Tagar played the role of Shiri in Dan Wolman's JFFA winning movie \\"Foreign Sister\\". Later on the same year, her father Rafi died from aneurysm after being comatose for a year.

Her career was propelled forward by her critically acclaimed role in the 2014 movie Zero Motivation. She was nominated for the Ophir Award for Best Actress the same year. IndieWire named her as one of the 20 \\"breakthrough\\" actresses of 2014, noting that \\"Tagar’s mostly worked in TV back in Israel, but with the growing buzz around “Zero Motivation,” [they] wouldn’t be surprised to see her ending up with gigs further afield down the line\\". Starting her professional career at the relatively old age of 31, Tagar's newfound star status in Israel became more noticeable in 2016, when she was casted for the lead role of Natalie Katan in \\"Sisters\\", and simultaneously for the role of the main antagonist in the teen musical comedy-drama TV show Oboy, which won an Israeli Academy Award for Best Comedy. In 2017, Tagar's performance as Natalie Katan won her her first Israeli Academy Award for acting. Throughout 2018, Tagar was a panelist on Gav Ha'Uma on 10 different occasions.

In 1899, Kang Youwei and his followers established the Chinese Empire Reform Association in Victoria and gained enormous financial and staff support from the local Chinese community.Chen, Zhongping. \\"Victoria’s Chinatown, a gateway to the past and present of Chinese Canadians.\\" University of Victoria Libraries. Accessed Feb. 12, 2019. https://www.uvic.ca/library/featured/collections/place/victoria/index.php . In August 1903, The Chinese Empire Reform Association published the Chinese Reform Gazette (日新报; 1903-1911) in Victoria. This may be the earliest Chinese newspaper in Canada.She, Liaoning. “从革命到建设：辛亥革命前后海外华人政治心态的蜕变 – 以《大汉公报》及崔通约为例 [The political attitude trend of overseas Chinese after The Revolution of 1911 -using Canada newspaper\\"Chinese Times\\" as an example].” She Hui Ke Xue Ji Kan [Social Science Journal] 6, no. 215 (2014): 159-167. Since then, various political groups from China contested for support from overseas Chinese populations, and newspapers were one the best means to influence the local public. In January 1911, Sun Yet-sen came to Canada to raise funds for his anti-Qing uprisings in China. During this trip, he was warmly welcomed by the local Chinese communities especially the Chee Kong Tong (Later Chinese Freemasons). The Chee Kong Tong in Victoria mortgaged its building for $12,000. Adding the donations from Chee Kong Tong organizations in other Canadian cities and the local Chinese communities, Sun received about $40,000 from the Canadian Chinese community, which was the largest donation at the time.Li, Donghai. Jianada Hua qiao shi. [A history of Chinese in Canada]. Taipei: Zhonghua da dian bian yin hui, 1967.P.7. On April 27, the Second Guangzhou Uprising occurred in Guangzhou, China. Possibly in 1912, Mr. Gao Yunshan (Chinese name: 高云山 English name: Ko Bong) founded the New Republic newspaper in Victoria with his colleagues Li Tianmin (李天民 Walter Lee), Huang Bodu (黄伯度 Wong Bark Du). In 1912, the Kuomintang (KMT) or Chinese Nationalist Party was founded and the Canadian KMT branch reported to the San-Francisco KMT headquarters.Li, Donghai. Jianada Hua qiao shi. [A history of Chinese in Canada]. Taipei: Zhonghua da dian bian yin hui, 1967.P.304. The New Republic became the Canadian KMT party's newspaper. The local key KMT members including Guan Baohua, Huang Bodu, Li hanping, and Ma Jieduan (Chinese: 关宝华, 黄伯度, 李瀚屏, 马杰端) were the earliest editors. Their written communication documents can be found at the Chinese KMT Archives at Taiwan. In 1915, Sun Yat-sen assigned Xia Chongmin (Chinese: 夏重民) to Canada. When Yuan Shikai restored the monarchy in China, following Sun Yat-sen's order, Xia Chongmin formed the overseas Chinese Volunteer Regiment (Chinese: 華僑義勇團) and the Airforce Team (Chinese: 航空隊) to join the anti-Yuan revolutionaries. The two regiments were made of over 110 trained volunteers from the overseas Chinese community members and their adult children who were born outside of China.Li, Donghai. Jianada Hua qiao shi. [A history of Chinese in Canada]. Taipei: Zhonghua da dian bian yin hui, 1967.P.7. After the Second Revolution, the KMT was dissolved and Sun established the Chinese Revolutionary Party (中华革命党 Zhonghua geming dang) in Japan in 1914. However, the English name of KMT “the Chinese National League” was still used in North America in order to fulfill its fundraising purposes.Shi, Xiaoning. “加拿大国民党小史[A brief history of KMT in Canada].” unpublished article. From 1915 to 1918, frequent debates and controversies arose between The New Republic and The Chinese Times (Pinyin: Da han gong bao, Chinese: 大汉公报, 1907-1992). The latter was a newspaper of Vancouver's Chinese Freemasons organization (Chinese: 致公堂). The argumentative articles reflect the contradictory political opinions about the future of China after the Revolution of 1911 (Chinese: 辛亥革命). The New Republic was frequently monitored by the Chief Press Censor of Canada. In 1916, The New Republic editor Li Gongwu (Chinese: 李公武) and other Chinese National League members attacked the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA, Chinese: 中华会馆) officials. On September 1st, 1918, a local Chinese Nationalist League member Wang Cang assassinated Tang Hualong (Chinese: 汤化龙). the former Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republican government, in Victoria's Chinatown.Chen, Zhongping. “Tang Hualong,” Victoria’s Chinatown, a gateway to the past and present of Chinese Canadians. http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=tang_hualong.html. Not long after the assassination, the Chinese National League was banned by the Canadian government. However, The New Republic newspaper was not banned. In 1919, six KMT members including The New Republic's chief editor Chen Shuren (Chinese: 陈树人) were arrested in Vancouver. The censorship of KMT party in Canada was ended in June 1919.Shi, Xiaoning. “一战中加拿大国民党支部 ‘党禁’事件始末 [How was the KMT branch in Canada banned during the World War I?].” Accessed Feb. 12, 2019, http://www.sohu.com/a/254306225_523175. Since the Canadian Federal government introduced the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1923, the Chinese communities went through hardships, including the Depression in 1930s and the Sino-Japanese War. During the War, the families of many Canadian Chinese immigrants could not come to Canada and struggled to survive. After the war, Foon Sien Wong (Chinese 黄文甫,) a UBC graduate who grew up at Cumberland, BC, worked as editorial staff of the New Republic Chinese Daily. In 1948, he became the president of CCBA in Vancouver, and for the following eleven years he lobbied the federal government to gradually equalize immigration rights for Chinese Canadians with their European counterparts.Wang, Larry. “The Life and Times of Foon Sien.” British Columbia History 38, no.3 (2005): 6-8. In 1958, The New Republic moved from Victoria to Vancouver and continued publishing until 1984. The last chief editor was Mr. John Hsu (Chinese: 徐新漢), who also served as the chief editor of the World_Journal from 1981 to 2002. ==Research value== The New Republic represents the perspective of the Kuomintang, one of the key players on the Chinese and Taiwan political stages over more than a century. As such, it is a valuable historical resource for any researcher interested in the influence of KMT on the overseas Chinese community in the past seventy years. The New Republic recorded not only the opinions and activities of Chinese Canadians in the key historical periods of the Republic China, the World Wars I and II, and Communist China, but also the history of local Chinese immigrant societies and their interactions with other ethnic groups in Canada. == References == Category:Chinese-language newspapers published in Canada Category:Newspapers published in Vancouver Category:1911 establishments in British Columbia Category:1984 disestablishments in British Columbia ","title":"The New Republic (newspaper)"},{"id":"60266190","text":"Pinellas High School was a public high school from 1934 until 1968 in Clearwater, Florida.

The flour-milling industry was present and flour-milling machinery was made at High Orchard Works (1851), while Atlas Works (1860) was the home of Fielding & Platt who made industrial machinery with a specialism in heavy-duty hydraulics.

It is an erect or pendulous shrub with pinnate leaves and pink, four-petalled flowers. It is only known from a few collections near Mount Isa. ==Description== Boronia hoipolloi is an erect shrub with pendulous branches up to long and with most of the plant, except the flowers, densely covered with star-like hairs. The leaves have between seven and twenty five leaflets and are long and wide in outline on a petiole long. The leaflets are linear to narrow elliptic, long and wide, the end leaflet longer than the last side leaflet but shorter than the others. The flowers are pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to five in leaf axils, the groups on a peduncle up to long. The four sepals are narrow triangular, long, wide and densely hairy. The four petals are long, wide and hairy on the back. The eight stamens are hairy with those opposite the sepals longer than those near the petals. Flowering occurs from May to June and the fruit is a mostly hairless capsule about long and wide. ==Taxonomy and naming== Boronia hoipolloi was first formally described in 1999 by Marco F. Duretto who published the description in Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (hoipolloi) is derived from the Ancient Greek hoi polloi meaning \\"rabble\\", referring to the habitat of the type specimens \\"being found on the outer parts of an amphitheatre, where one expects to find 'the rabble' congregating\\". ==Distribution and habitat== This boronia grows in crevices on sandstone cliffs and on scree slopes and is only known from an area north of a mining camp about north of Camooweal. ==Conservation== Boronia hoipolloi is listed as \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. == References == hoipolloi Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1999 Category:Taxa named by Marco Duretto ","title":"Boronia hoipolloi"},{"id":"60266644","text":"Terence Frank McIntyre (born 2 July 1930) is an English former first-class cricketer and Royal Air Force officer.

Peter Kid was a 17th-century Presbyterian minister. He was possibly a native of Fife. ==Ministry== He graduated with an M.A. from St Andrews University in 1650. He was ordained (by the Protesting Party) to Douglas in 1654. He was deprived of his office by an Act of Parliament 11 June, and Decreet of Privy Council in Glasgow 1 October 1662. He became the indulged minister of Carluke along with Alexander Livingstone of Biggar on 3 September 1672. For refusing to observe the Anniversary of the Restoration of Charles II and to join in the National Thanksgiving for His Majesty's deliverance from the Rye-house Plot, he was summoned before the Privy Council, 8 July 1673, and again 11 August 1677, when he was fined in one-half times his stipend. For a similar offence his indulgence was withdrawn, on 8 October 1684, and he was ordered to leave the country. He further declined (unlike everyone else on that day) to come under any obligation not to preach without a licence from the Government, and was sent to the Bass Rock where he remained a prisoner from May 1685 to 21 September 1686. Owing to inﬁrmity, Kid petitioned the Privy Council to set him free; at the same time agreeing to live privately, in his own house and to abstain from preaching. On these conditions the Committee granted order and warrant for his release. Wodrow says he was eminent in the gift of prayer. Kid is recorded as sometimes being so caught up in prayer that he forgot himself and used up all the time he should have preached. He was living at Waygateshaw, Carluke, 28 May 1687, as appears from a bond in his favour of that date. It is uncertain whether he returned to Douglas or not, or if he survived the Revolution. James Gibson and Charles Rogers say he died in 1694. He was buried at Carluke. ==Other names== He was called Francis Kid in Baillie's Letters. ==Epitaph== Peter Kid originally had a tablestone inscription much like that of John Blackadder. This was replaced in 2014 by an upright stone. A faithful, holy pastor here lies hid— One of a thousand — Mr Peter Kid: Firm as a stone, but of a heart contrite, A wrestling, praying, weeping Israelite. A powerful preacher, far from ostentation, A son of thunder and of consolation. His face, his speech, and humble walk might tell That he was in the Mount and Peniel. He was in Patmos, and did far surpass In fixed steadfastness the Rocky Bass. His love to Christ made his life to be spent In feeding flocks and kids beside his tent. His frail flesh could not equal paces keep With his most willing spirit, but fell asleep. His soul's in heaven, where it was much before, His flesh rests here in hopes of future glore. Passenger! ere thou go, sigh, weep, and pray— Help, Lord, because the godly do decay. ==Family== He married Susanna (died March 1697), daughter of Sir John Cheisley of Kersewell, and had children — John ; Elizabeth ; Anna ; Grizell, who were served heirs, 17 February 1694. ==Bibliography== *Wodrow's Analecta, iii., 120 *Tombstone *Bass Rock, 375 *Rankin's Carluke, 69 *Irving's Upper Ward, ii., 404 *G.

In 1879 he was preferred to the prebendal stall of Ampleforth at York Cathedral. He was a lifelong friend of James Raine, the noted antiquarian and founder of the Surtees Society, once a master of Durham School. ==Works== In 1846 Ornsby published a short topographical work, Sketches of Durham. For the Surtees Society he edited Denis Granville's Remains, in two volumes, 1861 and 1865; John Cosin's Correspondence, 2 vols. 1869–1872; and Selections from the Household Books of Lord William Howard of Naworth, 1878. He left unfinished an edition of Thomas Comber's correspondence. In 1882 appeared his Diocesan History of York. ==Personal== On 1 May 1843 he married Anne (d. 1872), eldest daughter of John Wilson JP and deputy lieutenant, of The Hill, Brigham, Cumberland; they had two sons and two daughters. Ornsby died at his home in Fishlake on 17 April 1886. In an account of his life written in The Durham University Journal it was noted he remained active up until his death, taking two full services on Sunday and visiting a sick parishioner on Monday, dying later that week on Saturday morning after a short and sudden illness. ==Notes== Category:1809 births Category:1886 deaths Category:English Anglican priests Category:English antiquarians Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London Category:Alumni of University College, Durham Category:People educated at Durham School ","title":"George Ornsby"},{"id":"60266927","text":"Jonathan Spokeyjack (born 13 November 1998) is a Vanuatuan footballer who plays as a midfielder for Vanuatuan club Erakor Golden Star and the Vanuatu national team. ==Club career== Spokeyjack started his career in the national Teouma Academy.

Four variants were serially produced, with the R-22S Június 18 the most numerous. There were several improvements within the types and there were three one-offs. Overall, 104 were built. They set numerous national records and one finished runner-up for distance at the 1958 VIIth World Gliding Championships, coming 11th overall. ==Design and development== Chronologically, the R-22 family developed through the family developed from the original R-22 Futár to the R-22S Június-18 and its one-off variants, the \\"lamináris\\" and \\"vizes\\", then into the three R-22SV Super Futár variants. All had wooden structures, cantilever, shoulder-mounted wings, all but one with spans of about and Göttingen Gö 549 airfoils. They were single-spar structures, composed of two half-wings pinned together centrally with plywood covering ahead around the leading edge forming a torsion resistant D-box. Aft of the spar, the wings of the R-22 and R-22S were fabric-covered but those of the later R-22SV were ply-covered apart from the ailerons. The ailerons of the early models were long, occupying about 60% of the trailing edge, and broad chord. There were flaps inboard of them, with three intermediate positions between the extreme -7° (up) and +21° deflections, though the last ten R-22Ss had no flaps. Because the wingtips of the R-22SV were not rounded but squared- off, with \\"almond\\" fairings, their Frise-type, mass-balanced, divided ailerons were shorter, less than half the span, and were also narrower to compensate for the lost wing area. The R-22 had Gôttingen spoilers mounted on to the rear of the spar but on early production R-22SVs they were replaced with spoilers of Rubik's own design, which had three horizontal close-spaced metal channels in both lower and upper brakes, each fitting within the next for compact retraction. These failed to produce the expected braking and the Gôttingen type was reintroduced in later R-22SVs and used in all later models. The ovoid-section, wooden fuselage of the original design, the R-22, was a ply covered, semi-monocoque shell formed over frames and stringers. It had a framed canopy with flat plexiglass windows which stretched to mid-chord, smoothly curved into the tapered rear fuselage profile. There was a semi- recessed monowheel under about mid-chord, with a landing skid ahead of it and a tailskid. The integral, ply-covered fin was tall and broad, carrying a large, roughly quadrantal fabric-covered rudder which reached to the keel. Its strutted tailplane was rectangular in plan out to rounded tips and carried tapered elevators, their trailing edges almost ahead of the rudder hinge line. The main change on the R-22S was a higher, shorter, one-piece, bubble canopy mounted onto a removable ply fairing, extended at the rear to blend into the upper fuselage which was slightly lower, flattening the top of the ovoid. The canopy and rear fuselage were revised again on the 1957 R-22SV. Early production models, the B-Futár, had a one-piece bubble canopy which allowed an unbroken, deepened fuselage profile back to the fin. Other changes were to the rudder, now with an angled straight tailing edge, and to a new, cantilever tailplane. The C-Futár version of the R-22SV, flown the following year, had a two-piece canopy which reached to the nose. The tail surfaces were more angular, with a square tipped vertical tail and trapezoidal horizontal surfaces set further aft than before, so requiring an elevator cut-out for rudder movement. There was also a major undercarriage change with a retractable monowheel. This was fully exposed when lowered but only slightly so when retracted; the nose skid was shortened and reduced in length and depth. There were three one-off variants. The first, flown in 1953, was the R-22S \\"lamináris\\" Június-18, which had a laminar flow wing entirely ply- covered apart from the ailerons, and with a NACA 632-615 airfoil. In contrast to the Június-18, its leading edge was straight and unswept, with blunter wingtips, shorter ailerons and no flaps. In 1953 the tips were given small \\"almond\\" fairing, though these were removed in 1960. Its fuselage and tail was originally unchanged from the Június-18 but in 1960 they were replaced by those of a R-22SV C-Futár. At the same time the span was reduced to to allow it to compete as a maximum span Standard Class sailplane. The R-22S \\"vizes\\" Június-18 was another one-off Június-18 variant, first flown in the spring of 1954. Two water tanks were built into the wings, which were entirely ply- covered and with shorter span ailerons. \\"Almond\\" tip fairings were added in 1955. The fuselage was unchanged apart from a small, dorsal fin root fairing, a more strongly curved rudder and a cantilever tailplane. In 1957 it got a new, 105° butterfly tail with trapezoidal surfaces and a long tailcone. The last one-off, the R-22SV Standard Futár or D Futár, was, like the C Futár, first flown in the spring of 1958. It was a Super Futár (C Futár) with span reduced to to enable it to compete in the Standard Class. ==Operational history== The prototype R-22 first flew in the winter of 1943 and gained its airworthiness certificate, permitting cloud flight and basic aerobatics, the following spring. Production was delayed by the war and the prototype was slightly damaged at an airshow in the summer of 1944. Repairs were completed in 1947 and another ten were produced between 1948 and 1950. The R-22S Junius 18 first flew on 29 June 1950. Production followed rapidly, with seventy examples in total. It set many Hungarian records between 1950 and 1955. Ten R-22SV Super Futár (B Futár) first flew in March 1957 and ten were built. The same year they also set several new national records. Ten of the C Futárs, the first flown April 1958, were built. The sole Sandard Futár competed at the VIIth World Gliding Championships, held in Lezno in 1958. Nandor Opitz flew it into 11th place overall and flew the second greatest distance (), gaining the first Hungarian Diamond C badge in the process.

She develops surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for bioanalysis, and has won several awards for her research, including the Coblentz Society Craver Award. == Early life and education == Faulds studied forensic and analytical science at the University of Strathclyde, graduating with a BSc in 1998. She remained at Strathclyde for her doctoral studies and in 2003 received her PhD for research on the detection of drugs of substance abuse using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). ==Career and research== Faulds worked as a postdoctoral researcher for on the detection of DNA using surface-enhanced resonant Raman spectroscopy (SERRS). She became increasingly interested in the use of analytical chemistry to improve people's lives. Faulds was appointed as a lecturer in 2006. Faulds was promoted to Reader in 2012 and Professor in 2015. Faulds works on the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for analytical detection. SERSs permits multiplexed and sensitive biological analysis. Her work uses signal amplification methods for the quantitative analysis of biomolecules, as the sensitivity allows her to detect target DNA and proteins. SERS also allows Faulds to make multiple measurements of different analytes in one sample. In 2015 she was the first woman and youngest person to ever be elected chair of the Infrared and Raman Discussion Group (IRDG). She has described C. V. Raman as her \\"hero of spectroscopy\\". Her recent work has looked at the optical detection of Listeria using bionanosensors. The bionanosensors permit the multiplexed detection of pathogens, which can remove the risk of infectious diseases without the need for antimicrobial drugs. She covers SERS active magnetic nanoparticles with lectins, which can recognise and bind to carbohydrates in bacteria. These nanoparticles can collect and concentrate bacteria from production lines. Silver nanoparticles are functionalised with a biorecognition molecule, such as an aptamer, and Raman reporter, resulting in a SERS signal when a nanoparticle binds to the bacterial target. The magnetic component can then be studied further using portable Raman spectrometers. Faulds is a founding member of Renishaw plc diagnostics, a University of Strathclyde spin-off company, and serves as its Director of Research. Faulds joined the editorial board of RSC Advances in November 2016 and as Associate Editor of RSC Analyst in August 2020.

It applies to situations involving negative externalities such as pollution and crime, and positive externalities such as education. Related efforts to achieve socially optimal quantities of externalities have long been a focus of microeconomic research, most famously by Ronald Coase and Arthur Pigou. Externality problems persist despite past remedies, which makes newer approaches such as the efficient voter rule important. In the context of negative externalities, the efficient voter rule states that when individuals who receive the same harm from a problem vote on whether to eliminate that problem at a uniform cost per individual, the outcome will be efficient, regardless of each individual’s contribution to the problem. The Rule applies similarly to positive externalities, as exemplified by the solar panel example below. The efficient voter rule indicates that voting on a collective action or policy change should lead to an efficient outcome. Possible applications include policy decisions about clean energy, noise pollution, over-fishing, smoking bans, zoning, septic systems, and fuel economy standards. In the context of crime, recent applications include votes on the strict enforcement of traffic laws. The vote in Tucson, Arizona, on whether to use cameras to catch drivers who run red lights provides one example. The community voted against this strict level of enforcement. According to the efficient voter rule, this outcome indicates that community members collectively received a greater benefit from occasionally skirting the law than from protection from malfeasance. The literature explains why the efficient voter rule applies even if individuals cause differing levels of damage and if a given amount of damage from each individual is completely external. == Example == Consider a policy proposal to require each of the 100 households in an economy to rent a solar panel that costs $400 per year, net of the value of the energy provided to the user. Suppose each panel would prevent $600 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year. The pollution is uniformly distributed, so each of the 100 households incurs 1/100 × $600 = $6 worth of the harm that could be avoided by each panel yearly. Although society's $600 annual benefit from each panel exceeds the $400 annual cost, each household only internalizes $6 worth of the environmental benefit—far less than the rental cost of a panel. So the privately optimal decision is to not rent a panel. To reach the socially optimal decision, residents could vote on the policy proposal. If enacted, the policy would cost each household $400 per year. The total damage each household would avoid each year if the policy were enacted—the household's annual benefit from policy enactment—would be 100 x $6 = $600. So the voting mechanism causes each household to internalize the entire $600 yearly benefit to society of purchasing a panel, and the incentive is for households to vote in favor of the socially optimal policy. Suppose instead that each panel would prevent only $300 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year, again spread uniformly among 100 homes. In that case, it would not be socially optimal for residents to purchase panels, because the $400 annual cost would exceed the $300 annual benefit. Again, a vote would yield the socially optimal solution: If the policy were implemented, each resident would avoid it's 1/100 x $300 = $3 share of the harm from each of 100 panels yearly, but this $300 benefit would fall below the $400 annual cost of a panel, so each resident would vote against the requirement and collectively the community would achieve the socially optimal outcome. == References == * Anderson, David A., 2019, Environmental Economics and Natural Resource Management, New York: Routledge. * Anderson, David A., 2011, \\"A Voting Approach to Externality Problems,\\" Journal of Economic and Social Policy: Vol. 14: Iss. 1, Article 4. * Coase, Ronald H., 1960, “The Problem of Social Cost,” Journal of Law and Economics, 3, 1-44. * Pigou, Arthur C., 1932, The Economics of Welfare, London: Wentworth. === Further reading === * Battaglini, M., Morton, R., and Palfrey, T.

At the end of her studies, Ortega worked for the first time as an art director for an advertising agency named Sm2, while continuing with illustration. She devoted all her free time to creating book covers and publishing the comic book anthology Shade. During those years she worked in graphic design, advertising, figurine design, role-playing games, video games, and comics. Always anchored in the world of fantasy and terror, she was also clearly influenced by manga. The influence of anime can also be seen in her illustrations. In 2005, she began working as an illustrator for Norma Editorial, remaining with them for a year and a half. She then published her first series of collections of images associated with stories, including Forgotten. In 2007, the first volume of Forgotten was published in Spain. It would subsequently be translated into several languages, such as French, English, Italian, and German. Forgotten consists of four stories that combine Gothic and romantic elements. ==Works== ===Books=== * Forgotten 1: El Reino sin nombre, Norma, 2007; containing: \\"El alma de la araña\\", \\"Rosa salvaje\\", \\"La caja de música\\", and \\"El canto de Lorelei\\", * Forgotten 2: El portal de los destinos, Norma, 2008; containing: \\"Melodía espectral\\", \\"El grito de la Banshee\\", \\"Cartas en la oscuridad\\", and \\"La Rosa de los Vientos\\", * Forgotten 3: Las Colinas del Silencio, Norma, 2010; containing: \\"El Cortejo de las Ánimas\\", \\"Cuando llegue diciembre\\", \\"La alianza de coral\\", and \\"El manantial de la luna\\", * Nocturna, Imagica, 2011, * Reflejos, compilation, 2014, ===Collaborations=== * Exotique, Ballistic Publishing, 2005 * In Dark Alleys, (Brian St. Claire-King), Vajra Entreprises, 2006 * Exotique 2, Ballistic Publishing, 2006 * Shade, (Lia Fiengo, Cris Ortega, Studio Kawaii, Hokane, Van Duran, Maria Abagnale, Ruui Eyvm), 2005 * Spectrum 14, Underwood Books, 2007 * Solidary King Kong, Scfiworld, 2008 * Exotique4, Ballistic Publishing, 2008 * Ecos de Azurëa volume 1, (Manuel F.

On the May 6 episode of NXT, Li had a match with Chelsea Green, which she lost due to a distraction from Aliyah. This led to another match between the two on the June 17 episode of NXT, with Aliyah getting the victory after Robert Stone distracted Li by vomiting in the ring. On the September 16 episode of NXT, she teamed up with Jessi Kamea in a losing effort against Kayden Carter and Kacy Catanzaro, with Li refusing to shake hands with them after the match. The following week, she competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the NXT Women's Championship, which was won by Candice LeRae.

At least as early as 1934, Deste was well known as one of Melbourne's eccentrics with examples of her eccentricity being noted right up to her death in 1996. ==Family== In March 1931 in London, Deste married Remigio Budica, a former opera baritone, whom she had met in Melbourne. They had one daughter, Toti.

She also appeared in stage productions with the likes of Tyrone Power Sr. and John Barrymore. In Australia, she first gained public attention as an actor and dancer, particularly through the original 1926 Melbourne production of Rose-Marie. She also appeared in many other J C Williamson's productions throughout Australia. Stephanie Deste was well known for attending most first nights at all Melbourne live theatres. Barry Humphries claims that Deste was one of the inspirations behind his most famous character Dame Edna Everage. This particularly applies to Dame Edna's flamboyant spectacle frames.https://www.facebook.com/1004466366276937/photos/a.1011242952265945/1541543699235865/?type=3&theater;https://www.smh.com.au/national/comic- genius-barry-humphries-20110614-1g1wg.html Perhaps only one photo of Deste wearing pretentious glasses is known to exist in the public domain.https://twitter.com/SKKArchive/status/1290565263759294464/photo/1 Robert Helpmann also cites Deste as one of the influences over his dancing and acting career. ===Beautician=== She owned beauty salons (ladies' hairdressing establishments) in the Melbourne Central Business District, the first being opened in 1938 on the corner of Elizabeth and Collins Streets. Originally, known as Make Ups Pty Ltd, the business name was later changed to Stephanie Deste Pty Ltd. Her initial partner in the business was Doris Rourke, with whom Deste had a major dispute that ended up in court later in 1938. Rourke claimed that Deste was breaking their agreement by spending too much time on theatrical and broadcasting matters. Deste was also accused of rudeness. Mr Justice Lowe agreed with most of what Deste wanted. ===Radio broadcaster=== Just after arriving in Australia in the late 1920s, Deste broadcast Bible stories, and appeared in broadcast plays on the Australian Broadcasting Company, predecessor of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Wireless Weekly magazine, 29 July 1927Wireless Weekly magazine, 4 January 1929; on-line edition - https://www.americanradiohistory.com/AUSTRALIA/Archive-Wireless- Weekly-AU/1929/Wireless-Weekly-1929-01-04.pdf Her many quirks were particularly noted in her unusual radio style, which were highlighted when she recommenced broadcasting on 3UZ just after World War II, presenting beauty hints and live advertisements for her beauty salons during the morning women's programs. In the late 1940s, Deste transferred to 3DB where she continued to broadcast until the early 1960s. As well as regular appearances in the morning programs, as from February 1954 she presented a half-hour program, Sunday Night with Stephanie Deste at 10.30 pm on a Sunday night.various newspaper radio program guides in the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne The program was sponsored by the Stephie Deste Pty Ltd beauty salons. It is believed that this time-slot was the cheapest offered by 3DB at the time.As from 1 February 1954, 3DB began broadcasting 24 hours per day. Prior to this, the station had closed at 10.30 pm on Sundays. 24 hour broadcasting at 3DB only lasted for a few months, and after this 3DB began closing at 1.00 am every morning. Every evening, a two-hour program called \\"The Dunlop Hours, Eleven 'til One\\" was broadcast after 11.00 pm. This meant that as from 1 February 1954, there was a half-hour gap in programming after 10.30 pm on Sundays, which is why Stephanie Deste was able to get this time-slot at very cheap rates. For more information on 3DB's broadcasting hours, go to 3DB and scroll down to 2.1 On air times. The program mainly consisted of interviews with show business personalities, both locals but, particularly, with artistes visiting from overseas. However, this eccentric program was usually more about Deste than about the people she was interviewing. Despite its late time-slot, Sunday Night with Stephanie Deste was popular with show-biz aficionados. ==Tribute== In 2013, Deste's grandson Marcus Encel produced a Loloclip video of just under three minutes about his grandmother.https://www.loloclip.com/marcus- encel/7XArA1GdGTAwAG3CA6A5SW.html ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Australian stage actresses Category:Australian film actresses Category:Australian silent film actresses Category:Australian female dancers Category:Beauticians Category:Hairdressers Category:Women in radio Category:People from Liège Category:Belgian emigrants to Australia Category:Radio personalities from Melbourne ","title":"Stephanie Deste"},{"id":"60267941","text":"Dr William Wallace FRSE FCS (1832-1888) was a 19th-century Scottish chemist who served as Glasgow's first Public analyst.

A more conservative form would be 'All-Star' or All-NBA level players who have recently or are currently still chosen to represent the best of the Eastern and Western conferences as All-Star players or were voted in as part of the All-NBA team at the end of every season. This term has now been used for some teams of the past but the most notable move, and arguably the 'first player-formed' Superteam, was ushered in when LeBron James had decided to join his fellow draft-class members, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, at the Miami Heat at the end of the 2009-2010 season. The three were named \\"the Big 3\\" and would establish their dominance by making it to the NBA Finals for all of the four years that they were together, winning back-to-back titles in the 2012 NBA Finals and the 2013 NBA Finals. LeBron had joined the Heat as a back-to-back MVP winner and equal six-time All-Star with Dwyane Wade, whilst Chris Bosh had been a four-time All-Star. Due to this, many other Superteams had been formed/drafted since then in order to secure a championship with the most prominent being the Golden State Warriors team from 2014 to 2016. This team included three perennial All-Stars in Stephen Curry (Also 2-time MVP, and first unanimous MVP winner), Klay Thompson and Draymond Green before securing one of the top players in the NBA in Kevin Durant from the Oklahoma City Thunder in free agency. At the start of the 2018–2019 season, the Warriors then signed All-Star, Demarcus Cousins from the New Orleans Pelicans in free agency and was the first NBA franchise in 42 years to start five players that had been, at one time, perennial All-Stars. Other teams include the attempt by Oklahoma City Thunder with Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony in the 2017–2018 season, albeit with little success, and the Cleveland Cavaliers with, again, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love from 2014 to 2018. Aside from the aforementioned Golden State Warriors, current teams with emerging Superteams include the Philadelphia 76ers and, according to some writers, the Boston Celtics. Although Superteams are a fairly new concept, some teams of the past have now been labelled as Superteams due to the multiple 'Superstars' that were on the team and their dominance on the league, such as the 2007–2012 Celtics and the most famous being the 1995–1998 Chicago Bulls with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. == Superteams of the modern NBA == === 2010: LeBron joins the Miami Heat, first player-formed superteam === Dwyane Wade (left) and LeBron James (right) led the Miami Heat to four Finals appearances and two Championships during their stint together. After the 2009–2010 season had concluded, LeBron James was in free agency and had free choice to choose which team he would play for next. He had just come off one of his highest-accumulating statistic production of his career, had been voted an All-Star six times and had won back-to-back MVP awards at the Cleveland Cavaliers. Although there was much speculation and hype surrounding James and his choice, it was kept hidden for many weeks until he announced his plans on a live television broadcast via ESPN that would be called \\"The Decision\\". He had chosen to join the Miami Heat where his fellow draft-class member and good friend, Dwyane Wade, was currently playing. Dwyane Wade had already had proved himself a superstar at the Miami Heat where he had won the NBA Championship in the 2005–2006 season as well as winning the Finals MVP. Other achievements also include being a 6-time All-Star, 5-time All-NBA and the NBA Scoring Champion in the previous season before LeBron James joined the Miami Heat. Chris Bosh, another member of the same draft-class, would also come to join James and Wade where he had just been a 4-time All-Star and the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks and minutes played when he had left the Toronto Raptors. The three would join together and make 4-straight NBA Finals appearances, with the first one coming the very season that they banded together. They lost the 2011 NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks before winning two straight over the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs respectively and becoming the first Eastern Conference team to win back-to-back titles since the Chicago Bulls of the late 90s. During this time, they had dominated much of the NBA and the Eastern Conference only to have a rematch with the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 Finals which they had lost. Wade (Left), James (Center) and Bosh (Right) celebrating on the bench as the Miami Heat vs the Washington Wizards Following their loss, LeBron James was once again in free agency and had left the Miami Heat to return to his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers and thus ending the run of the Miami \\"Big 3\\". During their time together, James had won back-to-back MVP and Finals MVP (2012 and 2013) as well as all 3 members being voted as an All-Star for every season that they were together. The 'Three' would also make NBA history with such feats as accumulating 27 straight victories between February 1 to March 27 of the 2012–2013 season, which was then the second-longest run in NBA history as well as being only the second time that three teammates had each scored 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a regulation match, which was last set over 50 years prior. Many other players and franchises would follow in the footprints of LeBron James and join other Superstar-caliber players to form their own Superteam in a quest to win an NBA Championship and challenge the Miami Heat Superteam. However, it would be LeBron James who would disband it and also form the next 'Big 3' in the league. === 2014–2018: Cavaliers vs. Warriors === alt= Following James' stint with the Miami Heat, he had decided to head back to his hometown team (the Cleveland Cavaliers), and once again form another 'Big 3' to compete for the title. Cleveland had already had Kyrie Irving on their roster who was drafted by the Cavaliers in 2011 (taken 1st overall). Before James joined the Cavaliers, Irving had already won Rookie-of- the-Year in 2012, was a two-time All-Star (and All-Star MVP in 2014) as well as being the youngest player in NBA history to score at least 40 points at Madison Square Garden. Joining them via trade would be Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves to complete the new LeBron James' 'Big 3'. Love had finished the previous season with his best production since joining the league with career high-averages in points and assists as well as making the All-Star game in 2012. In his 6-year stint with the Wolves, he had also recorded the longest streak of 'Double-Doubles' (double figure in two of either points, rebounds, assists, blocks or steals) at 52 in a row as well as the first player since Moses Malone in 1982 to record a 30 points and 30 rebounds night in a regulation game. With the acquisition of Kevin Love, who was considered one of the best power forwards in the league, and Kyrie Irving, perennial All- Star and 'future superstar', LeBron James had formed another 'Big 3' that had instantly made the Cleveland Cavaliers a title favorite. During the same season that LeBron had returned to the Cavaliers, the Golden State Warriors had also an emerging team that would later become the dynasty that would dominate the league and establish itself as another Superteam. Although James' team was built through trades and Free Agency, the Warriors would build their team through the draft and development to obtain the core that would come to challenge the Cavaliers for the best team in the league and the Championship. The Warriors had drafted Stephen Curry as the No. 7 pick in 2009, Klay Thompson as the No. 11 pick in 2011 and Draymond Green as the No. 35 pick in 2012 to form the nucleus of this team while adding Andrew Bogut (former No. 1 draft pick in 2005) and Andre Iguodala (2-time Defensive Player of the Year) to their roster to complete the core players that would ultimately challenge for the title in the 2014–2015 season. Although the Warriors would eventually be noted as a Superteam, during this season, their core players had yet to make an All-Star or All-NBA team except for Stephen Curry (All-NBA and All- Star in 2013) and Andre Iguodala (All-Star in 2012). This would all change in the 2014–2015 campaign when the Warriors had completed the regular season with the No. 1 seed with 67 wins out of 82 games and would make it through as the winners of the Western Conference to face LeBron's Cavaliers (the Eastern Conference champions) in the NBA Finals. alt= The young Warriors team would win the Finals over the Cavaliers in 6 games and bring home the NBA Championship to Oakland for the first time in 40 years (last won in 1975). This would firmly establish the Warriors as a Superteam as their core players won a multitude of awards in their breakthrough season: Stephen Curry (MVP, All-Star selection, All-NBA First team), Klay Thompson (All-Star Selection, All-NBA team), Draymond Green (All-Defensive team selection) and Andre Iguodala (Finals MVP). Cleveland's 'Big 3' had also won accolades that further bolstered their claim as a legitimate Superteam despite losing the Finals: Kyrie Irving (All-Star Selection, All-NBA Third team) and LeBron James (All- Star Selection, All-NBA First team). Following the 2015 Finals, these two Superteams would dominate their respective conferences the next year and have a rematch in the finals. Fans celebrating on the streets of Cleveland after the Cavaliers end the city's 52 year major title drought The Warriors had started the 2015–2016 season by breaking the opening number of wins (at 26, before losing on December 12 to the Milwaukee Bucks) as well as a number of other NBA records by the end of the season. These include the most road wins in a season (at 34), most consecutive number of home wins (at 54) and most important of all, the best regular season record at 73–9 which topped the record held by the Michael Jordan led Bulls when they had 72–9 record. The Cleveland Cavaliers had also topped the Eastern Conference and would again make it to the NBA Finals after defeating the Detroit Pistons, the Atlanta Hawks and the Toronto Raptors. The Warriors would also make it to the Finals but en-route they would face some problems in the Western Conference Finals where they found themselves down 3–1 in the series against the Oklahoma City Thunder after having beat the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers in the previous rounds. The Warriors would go onto win the series and once again face the Cavs for the NBA title which would ultimately end with the Eastern team coming back from a 3–1 deficit and become the first team to win the title from that position. Again, a number of accolades were awarded to players of both teams and further enhancing their status as superstars and Superteams whereby both \\"Big 3s\\" were selected into the All-Star match as well as Stephen Curry becoming the first-ever unanimous MVP, LeBron James winning Finals MVP in the series and Draymond Green joining both LeBron and Curry as part of the All-NBA teams. That following off-season (before the 2016–2017 campaign), the Warriors made a move to re-assert their spot as the most dominant franchise in the league by acquiring Kevin Durant when he became a free agent. Durant had been a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder and was part of the team that had the edge over the Warriors (3–1 lead) in the Western Conference Finals but unfortunately lost their lead and missed out on returning to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2012. Durant joined the Warriors highly decorated and arguably as one of the best players in the league with a resume that consisted of an MVP (in 2014), five-time NBA Scoring Champion, seven-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA which was said to have had put a highly talented Warriors Superteam into a league of their own. The Warriors were now heavy favorites to win the NBA Championship in the 2016–2017 season and take back the title from their Superteam rivals, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Much like the past two seasons, the Warriors and the Cavaliers made it through their respective conferences and met again in the Finals. Kevin Durant (Left) joins Stephen Curry (Right) and the Golden State Warriors in 2016 On the way to reaching the playoffs, the Warriors had matched or broken several NBA records. With the addition of Kevin Durant to a rather successful Warriors team, they would again reclaiming top seed overall with a 67 win regular season along with breaking the most games won by a 40-point margin or higher, and extending their run of most games without back-to-back losses in the regular season to 146 (stretching from 9 April 2015 to 2 March 2017). When the post-season came around, again the Warriors showed their Superteam strength by breaking the record for best start to the post-season (at 15–0), longest win streak in the playoffs (15) and best ever post-season record (16-1), whilst the Cavaliers made a strong run of their own by entering the Finals with only one loss from all of their series (entered the Finals at 12–1) before eventually relinquishing the title to the Warriors in a 4–1 series loss. The season ended with more accolades spread between the two teams including the Warriors having four players elected into the All-Star match (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson) which tied an NBA record, as well as the Cavs having their \\"Big 3\\" also included (LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love). All-NBA selections were also given to Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, LeBron James and Kevin Durant who also won the Finals MVP thus further supporting the claim that of the two Superteams, Kevin Durant had tipped the balance in favor of the Warriors. Victory Parade. Kevin Durant (pictured) would also win the Finals MVPalt= Although both the Warriors and the Cavaliers would remain favorites in their respective conferences, there was another shift in the Superteams when starting point- guard and member of the Cleveland's 'Big 3', Kyrie Irving, had decided to leave Cleveland and seek a trade. He would eventually be traded to the Boston Celtics in large part for Celtic's own starting point-guard, Isaiah Thomas who was injured at the time of the trade. Although Thomas had won an All-NBA selection the previous season, he was not seen as the same caliber of player as Kyrie Irving nor was there as much hype for the new 'Big 3' where eventually Thomas would struggle to come back from his injury and would be subsequently traded. This left the Cavaliers to still be led by LeBron James who had still managed to help his team make it through the Eastern Conference to the Finals albeit with a more troubled path than usual with near loses in series to the Indiana Pacers (4–3 series win) in the First Round and the Boston Celtics (4–3 series win) in the Eastern Conference Finals and only finishing 4th in the Eastern Conference standings. The Warriors also did not finish atop of the Western Conference (2nd in the West) and also had difficulty winning the Western Conference Finals over the Houston Rockets with only a slim 4–3 series win. Despite this, the Warriors finished the regular season with 58 wins and had cemented themselves as the team with the most regular season victories over a three-year span and would continue to write themselves into NBA records when they swept the Finals' series over the Cleveland Cavaliers (4–0) to take a second-straight title and win three of the four finals matches with their 'Superteam' counterpart. Kevin Durant would again win the Finals MVP and make the All-NBA team along with LeBron James and Stephen Curry again and while the two teams had battled for the previous 4-straight Finals (an NBA first), it would mark the end of their rivalry when James would decide to leave the Cavaliers and join the LA Lakers on a four- year deal after he became a free agent again. Note: the starting players of the Golden State Warriors (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Klay Thompson) were also known as the \\"Hampton 5\\" or the \\"Death Lineup\\". === 2018 Season: Warriors form an 'All-Star' team === As in 2016 when the Warriors signed Kevin Durant in free agency, the Warriors had reaffirmed their place as a Superteam when they signed Demarcus Cousins as a free agent from the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2018 off-season. Although he was injured when he joined the Warriors, he was still considered a dominant 'big man' with great skill and defensive tenacity which won him two All-NBA selections and been a four-time All-Star representative prior to the signing. He had joined a Superteam cast and the Golden State Warriors would be the first franchise in 42 years to be able to start five All-Star representatives (having all been All-Stars the previous year), one in each of the traditional basketball positions. It would be almost a year after his injury when Cousins would finally take the floor when the Warriors faced the Los Angeles Clippers on January 19, 2019 that the Warriors would be able to start all 5 All-Stars in the game. === Other franchises look to create their own 'Big 3' === Carmelo Anthony would be traded to OKC Thunder and the Houston Rockets in an attempt to form a 'Big 3' during the twilight of his career During the 2017 off- season, a year after Kevin Durant left for the Warriors, the Oklahoma City Thunder had moved to acquire Paul George, from the Indiana Pacers, and Carmelo Anthony, from the New York Knicks, to join Russel Westbrook in their bid to form their own 'Big 3' against the established Superteams: the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Anthony joined the Thunder as an aging star but had boasted 10 All-Star Appearances and 6 All-NBA selections whereas George was arriving at the prime of his career which had 4 All-Star appearances and 3 All-NBA selections as well. However, that would all come to an end the following season after a less-than-impressive showing by Carmelo that saw him traded to the Houston Rockets in their attempt to form a 'Big 3' along with James Harden and Chris Paul at the beginning of the 2018–2019 season. Harden had been a part of the Houston organisation since he was traded from the OKC Thunder in 2012. He would have five All-Star appearances and four All-NBA selections by the time that Anthony joined his team. Paul joined the rockets from the LA Clippers at the start of the 2017–2018 season and had arrived with 5 All-Star appearances and 4 All-NBA selections. This would also fail when after a few weeks into the season, the Rockets decided to trade Carmelo Anthony to the Chicago Bulls who would eventually waive him and thus ending the Houston 'Big 3'. During the 2018 offseason, the Toronto Raptors traded DeMar DeRozan to the San Antonio Spurs for four-time All-Star and two- time Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard. They began the 2018-19 NBA season 12-1, and finished the season with a 58-24 record. With Pascal Siakam winning the NBA Most Improved Player Award with averages of 16.9 points, 6.9 rebounds and 3.5 assists, the Raptors formed a 'Big 3' of Leonard, Siakam and 6-time All-Star Kyle Lowry. In the playoffs, the Raptors continued their successes, by beating the Orlando Magic in five games and the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games, capped by Leonard's historic buzzer-beater. They went on the beat the 60-22 Milwaukee Bucks with MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in six games. Finally, they defeated the injury-plagued Warriors in six games in the NBA Finals to win their first NBA championship. Unfortunately, Kawhi decided to not return to the Raptors next season, and he ended up going to the Los Angeles Clippers. On November 13, 2018, the Philadelphia 76ers made a mid- season trade for Jimmy Butler from the Minnesota Timberwolves to have him join up with their emerging superstars, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Butler joined the team as a veteran with 4 All-Star, 2 All-NBA and 4 All-Defensive team selections to add to Embiid's growing talent (accumulating an All-Star, All- NBA and All-Defensive team selection) and Simmon's budding-superstar potential that would see him earn an All-Star appearance later that season. The 76ers would also move for Tobias Harris (had one of his best productive seasons averaging 20.9 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists), from the Clippers, on deadline day to add another 'star' to the Philadelphia starting lineup to create their own version of a 'Big 4'. == Pre-modern NBA: Now considered superteams == Michael Jordan would be the leader of one of the most famous Pre-Modern Superteam when his Chicago Bulls team won their second three-peat While superteams existed in the NBA before 2010, the Heat with James was the first that players created. Multiple teams had at least three Hall-of-Famers or other star players that joined forces to dominate the league and become a strong force that won an NBA Championship. Some consider the team that actually 'fathered' the Superteam race was the Boston Celtics between 2008 and 2012 who traded for Kevin Garnett (a nine-time All-NBA and All-Star), and Ray Allen (seven-time All-Star and two-time All-NBA) from the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Seattle Sonics respectively, to join Paul Pierce (five- time All-Star and two-time All-NBA). and Rajon Rondo (a budding superstar who had yet to win his All-NBA and All-Star appearances). They won their ring in the 2007–2008 season and would go to the finals again in the 2009–2010 season only to lose to the Los Angeles Lakers spearheaded by Kobe Bryant. One of the most famous of the 'past Superteams' would be the 1995 to 1998 Chicago Bulls that three-peated the NBA Championship and consisted of Hall-of-Famers Michael Jordan (9-time All-Star, 3-time MVP, 3-time Finals MVP and 8-time All-NBA) and Scottie Pippen (4-time All-Star and All-NBA) who was then joined by Dennis Rodman (2-time All-Star and All-NBA) from the San Antonio Spurs. The trio would then go onto win 3-straight finals and set the then-record for most regular season wins at 72–10. The Philadelphia 76ers could also boast a 'Superteam' before their current roster was put together. In 1982, Moses Malone (two-time MVP and five-time All-Star) had joined the cast of Julius Erving (MVP, five-time All-Star and four-time All-NBA) and Bobby Jones (3-time All-Star and 5-time All-Defensive team) and they would go to average 60 regular season victories over 3 years and won their Championship Ring in the '82-'83 season. Charles Barkley (future Hall-of-Famer) would later join the Philadelphia team but no more rings were won by this Superteam. Magic Johnson encapsulated the \\"Showtime Lakers\\" that was the Superteam of the West during the 1980s In the 1980s, the Los Angeles Lakers had a formidable team in the \\"Showtime\\" Lakers that had a roster that boasted multiple stars that included the trio of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six-time MVP, nine-time All-Star and All-NBA) with Magic Johnson and James Worthy who each would go onto win multiple All- Star and All-NBA selections including a Finals MVP for Johnson in his rookie year. In a decade of this Superteam together, they had won 5 NBA Championships and developed a culture of 'Hollywood-glamour' and entertaining basketball. During this time, they had a 'rival Superteam' in the Boston Celtics who would challenge the 'Showtime' Lakers for NBA Championship Rings where they had won three during their reign. Although their core players were all young and had yet to make their mark, they would go onto win a number of accolades during the 80s that cemented their place as one of the most dominant teams of the decade, let alone the league. Throughout the 1980s, these accolades included for Larry Bird (nine All-Stars, three MVPs, 10 All-NBA and two Finals MVP), Robert Parish (seven All-Stars, two All-NBA), Kevin McHale (five All-Star, two All-NBA), and Dennis Johnson (five All-Star, two All-NBA and one Finals MVP), making them the superteam of the East to their counterpart Lakers in the West. Note: * All \\"All-NBA\\" and \\"All-Star\\" stats were at the time of the Superteam being formed. Does not show total appearances in their career. * Not all \\"Superteams\\" were added into this section. * Included the teams that have won an NBA Championship == \\"Super-Duos\\" == There are some acclaim the \\"Super-Duos\\" that lies just below the Superteam status and consists of only two superstars surrounded by other role players in their team. One such example is the Houston Rocket's former tandem of James Harden and Chris Paul. Following the departure of Carmelo Anthony, the Rockets kept their star back-court to challenge the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference. This also applied to the Oklahoma City Thunder who backed their 'Super-Duo' when, Carmelo Anthony was traded to the Houston Rockets after his first 'Big 3' experience had failed. Russell Westbrook (6 All-NBA, 6 All-Star) and Paul George were also two All-Star players in Oklahoma City that tried to bring home a championship to the Northwest Division.Another team in their division with a Super-Duo includes the Portland Trail Blazers with their own star back- court of Damian Lilliard and CJ McCollum. Lilliard boasts 4 All-Star appearances along with 3 All-NBA selections whilst his teammate McCollum has yet to accumulate any of his own but is still considered an ascending star. When the Boston Celtics traded for Kyrie Irving from the Cleveland 'Big 3', they had placed their trust in the newly attained Super-Duo when he was linked up with Gordon Hayward who was signed from the Utah Jazz as a free agent. Hayward added an All-Star appearance to Kyrie's 6 appearances and 1 All-NBA selection. They were surrounded by what many consider as young talent that could emerge as future stars in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Terry Rozier with an All-Star veteran to hold the team together in Al Horford (five All- Star and an All-NBA). However, the tandem was delayed when Hayward had a season-ending injury in the first 5 minutes of his debut in the first game of the 2017–2018 season. This tandem ended after Kyrie Irving left in free agency for the Brooklyn Nets after the 2018–19 season. However, one of the greatest tandems to form was the Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal pairing at the LA Lakers during the early 2000s. O'Neal was signed as a free agent from the Orlando Magic and was widely considered one of the most dominant big-men of all time to have played in the NBA. He joined the Lakers with a young Kobe Bryant and together would form a potent duo that would win a three-peat together before in-fighting and arguments had dismantled the super duo with O'Neal being traded to the Miami Heat. However, O'Neal would become a hall-of- famer and Laker legend by accumulating 15 All-Star, 14 All-NBA, an MVP, three Finals MVP and four NBA Championships whilst Bryant remained at the Lakers and had 18 All-Star, 15 All-NBA, an MVP, two Finals MVP. and five NBA Championships to have both numbers of his jersey retired. Another great 'super-duo' is one that is currently in the NBA, and that's the pairing of LeBron James and Anthony Davis for the Los Angeles Lakers. This duo is considered to be the best in the NBA right now, and some people might say that it's one of the best duos of all time. James is considered to be one of the best basketball players in NBA history. He has four NBA championships, four Finals MVP's, four MVPs, 16 NBA All-Star appearances, and 16 All-NBA Team appearances. Davis, on the other hand, has seven NBA All-Star appearances, four All-NBA appearances, four All-Defensive appearances, and one NBA championship. Together, the duo led the Lakers from being one of the worst teams in the West to the best team in the conference, with a 52-19 record and a 17-2 start, one of the best starts in Lakers history. The team went 16-5 in the 2020 NBA playoffs, and won the team's 17th championship, tying the Celtics for most all-time. The duo of Davis and James became the first duo in NBA history to score 25+ points while shooting 50% or more from the field in the same postseason since Kobe and Shaq did it in 2002. == Controversies == There have been some controversies about the new 'Superteam' era that has been brought into the NBA. Claims persists that superstar players are no longer looking to make the game competitive but rather finding an easier way to attain an NBA Championship Ring and nullifying other contenders by joining with other superstars. From LeBron's 'decision' to the Miami Heat and Durant joining the regular-season record holders in Golden State Warriors, there was derision from the media and fans in their choice to take an 'easy way' to the Finals and unbalance the NBA. However, there have been cases for both sides as others argue that the NBA still has its highest TV grossing revenue and that it was all done under the rules of the Salary Cap and that it's rather some entertainment in sports that should be enjoyed. == References == Category:National Basketball Association players Category:National Basketball Association teams ","title":"Superteams in the National Basketball Association"},{"id":"60268294","text":"Arkeisha Antoinette Knight, known professionally as Kash Doll, is an American rapper signed to Republic Records.

Today he is remembered among as the first modern Serbian cartoonists (the first being Dimitrije Avramović), though totally forgotten until the early 2000s. ==Early life and work== He was a self-taught artist when he first started to study art, sculpture and photography in a craft shop in Novi Sad. He studied under Đorđe Jovanović. In 1897 Pešić created an eight-page story in caricature (comic strip) showing a sculptor with clay in hand how he created a female figure that suddenly came alive when she began to dance with him. This was inspired by his relationship with Jovanović. More than three decades after his death, Pešić's eight-page strip was first published, in 1969, by the Belgrade's Museum of Applied Arts. Caricatures by Pešić were published numerous newspapers and popular magazines like Vrača pogačaču, Zvono, Bosnia and Balkans. A bust of Jovan Jovanović Zmaj by Jovan Pešić Pešić fought as a volunteer in the Serbian Chetnik Organization from its earliest beginning in 1903 until the Young Turk Revolution when the leaders of the Ottoman Millet in 1908 made demands on Turkish leadership to improve the status of her Christian population there. After, he went to Rome to study, and in 1914 he returned home to join the Serbian army in defense of Serbia. Later, he joined Serbian army's retreat through Albania and then left Salonika for Odessa, where he joined the First Serbian Volunteer Division as a soldier and war painter. During the final months of the war, he worked as a war photographer and was decorated with the Albanian Commemorative Medal. He became a member of Lada, the first Serbian art organization and one supportive of diverse artistic innovations of all kinds. ==After the War== In the art of sculpture, he performed several realistic portraitures of famous historical figures, including poet Vojislav Ilić in 1903. Since he spent most of his life in semi- seclusion and without sufficient orders for sculpting work, he was forced to devote himself to draw caricatures, which he published in various newspapers and comic books. At one time he was employed as a draftsman at the Ministry of Construction. His interest in political and social problems was very skillfully transferred to the level of the brutish satire, he reacted against various social distortions, snobbery, and communion. ==See also== * List of Chetnik voivodes == References == ===Sources=== * Pavlović. 1963: 63–73; Dragićević. 1964: 95—97; Janc. 1970: 121—130.

This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals. Zsolt Hernádi (born November 30, 1960) is a Hungarian businessman and the Chairman-CEO of MOL Plc., the Hungarian Oil & Gas company, since 2001. ==Early life and education== Zsolt Hernádi was born in Tarján on November 30, 1960. He grew up in Esztergom, where he spent his student years. First he was a student of Kossuth Lajos Elementary School, then he graduated from the mathematics department of the Dobó Katalin High School. Hernádi graduated from the Faculty of Industrial Planning and Analysis at the Budapest Corvinus University of Budapest (with a degree in economics) in 1986. As a freshly graduated student he became a trainee at Deutsche Bank in Germany. == Career == Zsolt Hernádi started his professional career at Unicbank and subsequently held various positions at the Kereskedelmi és Hitelbank (K&H;) between 1989 and 1994, becoming Deputy general manager in 1992. Between 1994 and 2001, Hernádi then served as the CEO of the Magyar Takarékszövetkezeti Bank (Takarékbank). == MOL == Hernádi joined MOL in 1999. He has been a member of MOL's board of directors since February 1999. In July 2000, he was elected chairman of the board and has served as chairman-CEO of MOL since June 11, 2001. Under Hernádi's leadership, MOL developed from a local Hungarian company to an international company in the oil and gas industry, with the firm's earnings growing seven-fold from $2.1 to $15.1 billion and market capitalization multiplying five-fold from $2.2 (data from December 2002) to $9.7 billion (data from January 2019). With Hernádi, the company has also adopted a new strategy, MOL Group 2030, built on the premise that demand for hydrocarbon-based motor fuels will gradually decline in the long run and with it is considered one of the first movers among the industry peers to acknowledge the expected weakening dominance of fossil fuels. During a hostile takeover attempt of MOL by OMV in 2007 and 2008, Hernádi was credited with playing a critical role in defending the company and securing MOL's independence. ==Controversies== ===Bribery allegations=== In 2011, Croatia started an investigation of ex-prime minister Ivo Sanader for allegedly accepting a €10 million bribe from MOL in exchange for the Croatian Government approving the First Amendment to the Shareholders Agreement and thus MOL securing management rights, also accusing the company's chairman Hernádi. MOL repeatedly denied all the accusation. Soon after, the Hungarian prosecution launched an extensive investigation on suspicion of bribery and in 2012 dismissed all allegations of any criminal activity. In 2014, the Croatian government initiated arbitration under UNCITRAL rules, seeking nullification of the First Amendment to the Shareholder's Agreement, claiming that MOL unlawfully obtained management rights. In 2016, UNCITRAL rejected all of Croatia's claims and cleared MOL of all accusations, including allegation of bribery and breaching the shareholder agreement. This was further confirmed by the Swiss Supreme Court. On December 20, 2019, the Zagreb County Court issued a first instance ruling in the Sander-Hernádi case, judging that the CEO of MOL was guilty of bribery and sentenced him to two years in prison. MOL Group declared its disappointment with the judgement “as the existing decisions of the Hungarian authorities and those of the United Nations Tribunal in Geneva concluded that there was no wrongdoing by any MOL Group officer”. MOL declared full support of its board for Hernádi.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-30/croatian-court- convicts-mol-ceo-of-bribery-in-battle-for-ina-oil The Hungarian government qualified the condemnation of Hernádi as political pressure. Two international legal scholars, Kai Ambos and David Anderson, Baron Anderson of Ipswich were appointed to independently monitor the fairness of the court case. The trial monitors accused the Croatian court of \\"bias\\" in support of Croatian \\"national interests\\" and violating internationally-recognised standards of fair trial, \\"including violating Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\\" On January 29, 2020, the same Zagreb court overturned its 2018 detention order against Hernádi. The decision, which can be appealed by Croatia's chief prosecutor, could lead to a cancellation of the European arrest warrant for Hernádi and his removal from an Interpol wanted list. ==Awards and recognitions== Hernádi was declared an Honorary Freeman of the city of Esztergom in 2007 and in September 2009, he was named Honorary Professor of Budapest Corvinus University. In 2010, Hernádi was honored with the Hungarian Order of Merit – Commander's Cross with Star of the Republic of Hungary, as a recognition for his efforts in diversifying and improving the security of supply in Central and Eastern Europe as well as his contribution to the development of MOL. In 2016, he was named the Honorary Citizen of the city of Százhalombatta and in 2017, was appointed as a member of the National Competitiveness Council in Hungary. In 2018, Zsolt Hernádi received the Titular University Professor title from Budapest Corvinus University. According to the Influence Barometer he is the 14th most influential person in Hungary in 2019. == References == Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian chief executives Category:Hungarian economists Category:Hungarian billionaires Category:People from Komárom-Esztergom County Category:Corvinus University of Budapest alumni ","title":"Zsolt Hernádi"},{"id":"60268324","text":"Desus & Mero is a TV presenting duo, Desus Nice and The Kid Mero and may refer to: * Desus & Mero (2016 TV series), former American television and web late- night talk show on Viceland * Desus & Mero (2019 TV series), current American television late-night talk show on Showtime ","title":"Desus &amp; Mero"},{"id":"60268370","text":"Norman D.

He served on the city council there and for four years in the New Jersey General Assembly. ==Biography== Olszowy was born in Passaic in 1921. He married Anne D. Niewaroski and had one son, Ronald, born in 1945. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and from 1947 to 1968 was in the United States Army Reserve attaining the rank of Major. A graduate from New York University, he worked as an insurance broker and was vice president of the Manhattan Rubber Workers Union. He also was a part of the American Legion. In January 1973, Olszowy was appointed to the Passaic city council and was elected to the council in November. He served on the council until taking his seat in the Assembly. In 1975, Olszowy ran for the Assembly from the 34th district consisting of southern Passaic County municipalities. Though Democratic incumbent William J. Bate came overwhelmingly in first place in the general election, Olszowy defeated another incumbent Democrat Herb Klein by just under 500 votes. Klein's backing of Governor Brendan Byrne's state income tax proposal was a factor in his defeat. During a late night 1976 session in the sweltering Assembly chambers during a debate on the creation of the income tax, Olszowy stood up. Speaker Joseph A. LeFante called on Olszowy to ask for the reason of his rising. Olszowy responded, \\"Mr. Speaker, I rise to aerate my shorts.\\" He was reelected in 1977 and 1979, both times with Democrat Bate. Olszowy died on April 18, 1980, of a heart attack at Passaic General Hospital. Following his death, The Record of Bergen County published an obituary which mentioned his arrest at 16 years of age for robbery. Assembly Speaker Christopher Jackman decried the newspaper for referencing it in his obituary. The newspaper publisher responded that as the arrest was brought up by a former political opponent that it was germane to publish. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:1980 deaths Category:New Jersey city council members Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Republicans Category:Politicians from Passaic, New Jersey Category:New York University alumni Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:United States Army reservists Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Emil Olszowy"},{"id":"60268667","text":"Haworthia nortieri is a species of succulent plant belonging to the genus Haworthia and is classified under the family Asphodelaceae.

After studying Germanic languages he became a teacher at various public schools, until 1975. He was one of the founders of the experimental Flemish magazine Tijd en Mens, and a member of the editorial board along with Louis Paul Boon, Jan Walravens, and Hugo Claus. He was not a very active editor and was not, he said later, interested in participating in the literary life of \\"lectures, meetings, and associations\\". Early in his career he used the pseudonym Johan Benth.Hans Vandevoorde: Ten oosten van Cami His first volume of poetry was published privately in 1950, In de tijd verloren, whose poems were praised by Flemish critic Karel Jonckheere for their inspired content but criticized for a lack of rhythmic and lyrical qualities. He also wrote and published short stories. ==Criticism== According to Hugo Brems, author of a 1986 review article occasioned by the publication of the anthology Gedichten 1954-1983, Cami's poetry is that of an mildly anarchist outsider, though his early poetry differs starkly from his later work, developing from more general analysis and critiques of man in general to more quotidian observations of individualized people and objects. For Brems, Cami's poetry doesn't start until the publication of Het land van Nod, a collection (really, one single long poem) in which the poet pictures himself as Cain, who wanders alone through a biblical and mythical landscape, a godless world. Though the content of the volume established Cami's status as an avant-garde poet (in the style of Tijd en Mens), Cain having metaphorically killed God by killing Abel, its style, according to Brems, is solemn and in places almost sacred. Later collections were less homogeneous and of lesser quality, and his 1974 volume Wat ik wil is gelijk aan nul are, according to Brems, little more than anecdotal comments on the times; the poet does not regain his poetic voice until the last collection, Wat is er met de dood gaande?, which Brems praises for its atmosphere and suggestive power. Cami was long unknown and forgotten. Paul Bogaert, writing in Tijd en Mens, argued his writing was old fashioned, and Patrick Peeters, in the Poëziekrant, says Cami was too traditional for the experimental poetry of his time, too abstract for neo-realism, too ironic or possibly too cynical for neo-romanticism, and only connected briefly with the socially and politically engaged poetry of the 1960s. Twelve years later, at the publication of Cami's last volume, Ten westen van Eden (\\"West of Eden\\"), Koen Vergeer, poetry critic for De Morgen, noted that Cami's reputation also suffered from a lack of consistency: \\"If you reread the collections you see much inconsistency: the lyrical-prophetic tone of Het land Nod, dark poetic prose in Roos uit modder, engaged anger in Blanco stem, to little-poetic effusions in Wat ik wil is gelijk aan nul\\". What is consistent, says Vergeer, is fear and nihilism, and in his best moments, especially after Ten westen van Eden, he moves beyond nihilism to \\"what really drives him\\". ==Collections== * In de tijd verloren (1950) * Het land Nod (1954) * Roos uit modder (1959) * Doorsneemens (1961) * Blanco stem (1967) * Wat ik wil is gelijk aan nul (1974) * Wat is met de dood gaande?

Edmund King Miller (c. 1820 – 17 May 1911), invariably known as E. K. Miller, was an Anglican minister in South Australia, the first principal of the Pulteney Street School in Adelaide. ==History== :Pulteney Street School, a \\"pretty Gothic building\\" opened with seven pupils at the corner of Pulteney and Flinders streets on 29 May 1848. This was ten months after St Peter's College opened in the schoolhouse of Trinity Church but six years before it had its own premises in Hackney. The school was clearly targeted at a different demographic, having a monthly charge of 2/6d per month for each pupil, deemed \\"a rate which the poorest can surely afford to pay for the education of their children\\". and by October 180 pupils had registered. The school initially catered for both boys and girls and was not restricted to Anglican families, attendance at Catechism classes being optional. Revd E.K. Miller, first Headmaster of Pulteney Grammar School Rev. Miller, who had previously held a similar position near Rotherham, Yorkshire, and his wife Mary Miller, née Kirtland, arrived in South Australia aboard Hindoo in April 1848 to take the position of headmaster, He was one of the two first clergymen to be ordained in the Diocese of Adelaide. He was twelfth Anglican clergyman in South Australia, the others being: *Bishop Short arrived December 1847 *Archdeacon Hale, stationed for a short time at Kensington and afterwards at St John's Church, Adelaide *Rev James Farrell, Trinity Church *Rev W. J. Woodcock, St. John's and afterwards Christ Church, North Adelaide *George C. Newenham, St Paul's, Port Adelaide *James Pollitt, St James Church, Mount Barker *J. C. Bagshaw, Burra *A. B. Burnett, St Stephen's, Willunga *W. H. Coombs, St George's, Gawler *John Fulford, St Mary's on the Sturt *T. P. Wilson briefly at SPC and St Johns, then returned to England (By 1853 the number had grown to 19.) Miller was required to combine headmasterly duties with those of assistant minister of Christ Church, North Adelaide, but appears to have had a breakdown and after three years, on medical advice (\\"either the madhouse or the cemetery\\"), he resigned from the school. Rev. Frederick Lamb and Mrs Lamb, who arrived in May 1851 took his place. By June 1852 the institution had become Pulteney Street Central Schools with W. A. Cawthorne appointed headmaster. In 1852 Miller took charge of St. George's, Magill, and was able to minister to victims of a diphtheria outbreak in the district. At considerable risk to himself he treated the throats of those affected with a caustic pencil, at that time the only effective remedy. His wife, who had nursed the family of Dr. Wark, caught the disease, as did her three children, and Miller nursed them as no one else dared come near. In 1863 Miller moved to Willunga, which also encompassed Aldinga and Noarlunga. He retired this cure on 1 January 1892 to live in Semaphore, where he was active in supporting local charitable organizations, notably the Deaf and Dumb institutions at Brighton and Wright Street, Adelaide, and the Convalescent Home at Semaphore. Miller was a regular contributor to the correspondence columns of The South Australian Register over a long period. Recurrent themes were his love of the Book of Common Prayer and his antipathy to the promotion of high church liturgy by a powerful cabal of Anglicans. ==Family== Miller married Mary Kirtland (c. 1821 – 29 October 1894) in England before leaving for Australia. Their children included: *Thomas Rhodes Miller (1849–1916) married Jane Todd Carrick (c. 1840 – 26 March 1898) in 1872; he married again, to Sarah Ann Best ( – ) in 1898, lived in Renmark *Mary Ellen Miller (1853–1928) married Thomas William Jones (c. 1855 – 4 July 1927) in 1878, lived in Western Australia *Isabella Ann Miller (1855–1920) married Alfred Everard Lucy (1854–1927) in 1877, lived at Second Valley *Edmund King Miller, jun.

While on staff, National Review gained a reputation for publishing clashing opinions on a wide range of policy issues. ===Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream=== In 2008, Salam co-authored Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream with Ross Douthat. The book grew from a cover story for The Weekly Standard, which called for a reinvention of Republican domestic policy. Salam and Douthat argued that the Republican Party had lost touch with its own base and that its Bush-era, big- government policies were \\"an evolutionary dead end.\\" They instead advocated \\"tak[ing] the 'big-government conservatism' vision\\" of Bush and giving it \\"coherence and sustainability\\" by vigorously serving the interests of the less affluent voters, who had become the party's base. The platform would include \\"an economic policy that places the two-parent family—the institution best capable of providing cultural stability and economic security—at the heart of the GOP agenda.\\" ===Melting Pot or Civil War?: A Son of Immigrants Makes the Case Against Open Borders=== Salam's second book Melting Pot or Civil War?: A Son of Immigrants Makes the Case Against Open Borders, was released in 2018. It \\"contends that while the United States should welcome more high-skilled immigrants, mass low-skilled immigration is swelling the number of poor people in a country that is struggling--with modest success at best--to fulfill the aspirations of the less privileged citizens already living here\\". The New York Times Ross Douthat (co-author of Salam's previous book) described it as \\"a rigorous, policy-driven argument for more-humane-than-Trump immigration restriction\\". Megan McArdle commended it for its \\"admirable and all-too-rare willingness to lay out the problem in clear terms\\", and Noah Smith, writing in Foreign Affairs, called it, \\"a thoughtful well-informed, mostly economic argument for limiting low-skilled immigration\\". ===Manhattan Institute presidency=== In February 2019, it was announced that Salam had been selected to become the new president of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. He succeeded Larry Mone, who retired after leading the Institute for 24 years. In May 2019, he officially took the helm. \\"I know not only that ideas matter, in other words, but also that the Institute's ideas can change lives for the better\\", he said at the Institute's 2019 Hamilton Award Dinner\\", continuing: A self-described \\"coalition builder\\", Salam was profiled in the Wall Street Journal shortly after taking on the presidency and described his interest in examining topics like urban \\"political monocultures\\", and \\"punitive multiculturalism\\", while still maintaining the Institute's focus on issues such as school choice, pension reform, limited government, and lower taxes. ==Political views and style== Salam has been described as \\"Literary Brooklyn's Favorite Conservative.\\" He has written that he intends to \\"pump ideas into the bloodstream of American conservatism.\\" Salam has taken a strong interest in congestion pricing and the encouragement of denser living arrangements, the promotion of natural gas and nuclear power, reform of the US tax code, and the fostering of a more competitive and diverse marketplace of educational providers. In the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Salam argued that white flight and unsustainable urban sprawl had contributed to high poverty levels. Drawing on the San Francisco Bay Area as an example, he has identified restrictive zoning policies as an important barrier to upward mobility in the US. He has defended work requirements for welfare recipients in New York City and elsewhere. He initially supported the Iraq War but has since called it a disaster of \\"world-historical proportions.\\" He claims to advocate policies that strengthen traditional family structure and has supported gay marriage. He has described as \\"brilliant\\" figures like Canadian Marxist philosopher Gerald Cohen and Reagan adviser and neoclassical economist Martin Feldstein. Salam with Doris Meissner and Danielle Allen at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics He has called for reducing immigration levels to encourage assimilation and integration, advocating the end of automatic birthright citizenship. ==Personal life== A Brooklyn, New York, native, Salam has returned to his home borough, where he now lives with his family. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * With Ross Douthat, Grand New Party.

It fundamentally draws on how people's physical bodies react to the external world, then considers the inner workings of the mind which result in a person's actions. == Background == According to Buddhism teachings, what is stopping the attainment of happiness are unconscious attachments to a lesser self. In order to achieve true happiness, one can practice the Nine Consciousness theory, a concept which helps one understand their true identity. The goal is to accept one's \\"infinitely expanded true self\\", by letting go of previously-held perceptions of who they were. The word \\"consciousness\\" in Buddhism was translated from the Sanskrit word \\"vijnana\\", and refers to one's self-awareness and one's capability to discern the various energies that influence their lives.http://www.sgi- usa.org/memberresources/study/2018_essentials_part3/docs/eng/06_EssentialsExam3_p14-15.pdf == Definition == The Nine Consciousness levels firstly consists of the five senses (touch, taste, sight, hearing, smell.) One is aware of these five consciousness levels from the moment they are born, taking in information about the outside world. The sixth consciousness is when one learns to understand what is being taken in from the five senses. This is the level that integrates all the sensory input gathered by the first five levels. It achieves this by processing all the data and information, then identifies what is communicated. One is able to make judgments about one's external perceptions through this sixth level. An example would be holding an orange, and knowing that it is the orange fruit, instead of simply an orange ball. All six levels form the sentient mind. The seventh consciousness, unlike the prior six levels, is directed towards one's inner thoughts without sensory input. Also known as \\"mano\\" in Sanskrit, this level deals with the abstract, and helps us \\"apprehend and express the unseen, or spiritual, side of life.\\" One can then distinguish between good and evil, and discern oneself from others. Attaining this consciousness also means one would be aware of the self, with the ability to detach or attach. Understanding one's self then results in assertiveness over one's gender, identity, nationality, etc. Buddhism warns that as this level is similar to the concept of one's ego, being controlled by this consciousness can lead to insecurity. The next level is the eight consciousness, or in Sanskrit \\"alaya\\", better known as the \\"storehouse consciousness\\". The \\"storehouse\\" accumulates all of one's karmic energy through interacting with others, as well as the causes and effects of one's actions. It stores all of one's thoughts, words, and deeds throughout a lifetime. Daisaku Ikeda, the founding president of community-based Buddhist organisation Soka Gakkai International (SGI) said: \\"The term storehouse conjures the image of an actual structure into which things of substance can be placed. But in fact it may be more accurate to say that the life current of karmic energy itself constitutes the eighth consciousness.\\" Unlike the first seven levels that cease when one dies, the eighth consciousness persists even after death. The karma collected by this consciousness accounts for every aspect of one's life in this lifetime and the next, including one's looks, circumstances, relationships, and health. One's soul is born with the previous lifetime's karma, which results in one's current circumstance in the world. Certain patterns in a person's life, such as being stuck in a cycle of abuse, or being angered by the same person, all boils down to one's karma. However, karmic energy is ever-changing and flowing; one's situation can change according to the negative or positive karma one has accumulated after a period of time. Karma can be accumulated in both thoughts and actions. The ninth and final consciousness, known as the Buddha nature (or Namu-myoho-renge-kyo), forms the foundations for one's life. It is the amala-consciousness, meaning the \\"purest\\", and cannot be tarnished by any of the karmic energy from the previous eight levels. Hence, a way of ridding oneself of negative karma is by rising above to the ninth consciousness. As the ninth consciousness is the core of all energy, it also serves as the source for all mental and spiritual activity.. If one is able to attain the ninth consciousness, one's soul can coexist peacefully with all lifeforms. == Practices == The goal of practicing the nine consciousness is to achieve an \\"infinitely expanded true self\\". This is in accordance to Buddhist philosophy, which focuses on being liberated from one's insignificant self to attain a higher state of being. Tapping into the ninth consciousness would equate to tapping into the very core of life. Firstly, one must be able to be acutely aware of what all five senses are taking in. This includes being conscious of what one can observe around them; the temperature, the colours, the taste or smell of the surroundings. In his book Awakening through the Nine Bodies, yogi and author Phillip Moffitt recommends an exercise where one places their hands on their thighs and focuses on the right hand. The aim of this exercise is to feel the sensation, or lack there of, in the hands. This includes feeling the weight of one's hands, the blood pulsing through the fingers, and even the heat gathered in the palms. According to Moffitt, consciousness is a process, where the mind focuses on a sensation that one or more of the senses are in contact with the environment. Moffitt terms this stimulation of the senses \\"sense- consciousness\\". To reach the next consciousness, meditation can also help one progress through the nine levels and eventually connect to the inner self by attaining self-awareness. The most basic method is by chanting \\"Namu-myoho- renge-kyo\\", but meditation can also be as simple as being alone in nature. Nichiren Daishonin, founder of Nichiren Buddhism, theorised that one can transform one's karma in this lifetime by achieving the final level of consciousness. Nichiren held the belief that each person is highly valued, and our bodies serve as the \\"palace of the ninth consciousness\\". One can access this \\"palace\\" by chanting \\"Namu-myoho-renge-kyo\\". The chant frees one from negative karma, improves the sensory awareness of the sixth and seventh consciousness, and purifies the karmic energy in the eighth. This creates positivity in every situation, an example being viewing a friend's anger when they yell at you as a sign of concern, rather than taking offense to it. This mantra offers meaning behind its individual words. \\"Namu\\" originates from the Sanskrit word namas, and refers to the devotion of oneself - expressing both one's intention to take action as well as one's attitude. The next word, \\"myoho\\", is an amalgamation of two words: \\"myo\\" meaning mystical, and \\"ho\\" which means law. Together, \\"myoho\\" refers to the universe's energy and the ways it manifests itself, or in other words, the Mystic Law. According to Nichiren, the word expresses both a Buddha's enlightenment and the delusions of a normal person, as they have the same essence. Next, \\"renge\\" means lotus flower. The lotus has a strong cultural significance in Buddhism. It is pure and sweet-smelling, despite growing in muddy waters. This represents the ability to thrive amidst the sufferings of daily life. Additionally, Its ability to simultaneously produce both the flower and seed embodies the principle of \\"cause and effect\\", bringing to mind the concept of karma. The \\"cause\\" here refers to the efforts one puts in to attain Buddhahood, and the \\"effect\\" is the actual attainment. This part of the mantra recalls the attainment of the eight consciousness, reminding one that one's karma can be changed anytime. The last word, \\"kyo\\", means \\"sutra\\", or teaching. Nichiren describes this as the \\"words and voices of all living beings\\". Its purpose in the mantra is to evoke the Buddha nature hidden within us. The Chinese character for \\"kyo\\" implies a \\"thread\\", and symbolises the continuation of life over countless lifetimes, and how it will persevere. Thus, \\"kyo\\" expresses the teaching that all that happens in the universe is from the Mystic Law manifesting itself. A key aspect of the mantra is that it is not limited to any culture or language. This is because the mantra itself has origins of the Sanskrit, Japanese, and Chinese languages. In the thirteenth century when Nichiren was living in Japan, Sanskrit represented the West's ideas, cultures, and language, whereas Chinese represented the East's. Hence, the mantra combines the historic ideologies of both the East and West, and is a universal phrase for all of mankind. Nichiren stated that while chanting, what is in one's heart is crucial. This means that one should fully believe that one's potential has no boundaries, and be focused on the goal of achieving happiness. It must be said that chanting this mantra is not meant to supply one with supernatural abilities, or something that is better than one that one should rely on. But rather, it represents the principle that through consistent effort, one will achieves their goals, or in this case, the different consciousness. Nichiren's advocation for the repeating chanting of this mantra is because it encompasses of Buddhism's teachings, and will ultimately lead to enlightenment. He wanted a practical way for people to focus on their minds and manifest their positive thoughts into reality. Spreading the \\"Namu-myoho-renge-kyo\\" mantra is called kosen-rufu in Buddhism. == Significance of attaining the ninth consciousness == One of Buddhism's teachings is to recognise one's innate ability to overcome all challenges in life. This is because one is not separate from the fundamental laws that govern the universe. Similarly, when one reaches the ninth consciousness, one would see their lives the same way the Buddha sees it, filling one with compassion and courage. Moffitt states that the exploration of the various consciousness is vital to one's spiritual journey. He cites that developing mindfulness, in other words \\"conscious of being conscious of a moment's experience\\", will aid one in attaining the different consciousness. One's journey will no longer face the challenge of one's own reactivity to negative events. Moffitt states that being mindful will lead to being liberated from unnecessary mindsets, including dislikes, fears, and desires. Ultimately, by no longer being controlled by these negative illusions, we will no longer be trapped in the cycle of wishing for good things and wishing for bad things to not happen. Buddhism looks to the Buddha as a paradigm for this liberation. The Buddha did not attain freedom from suffering through rituals or his beliefs, but by practicing mindfulness and gaining awareness of his consciousness. The Greek SGI community compares the emergence of Buddhahood in a person to a sunrise; the darkness fades away. This thus enables us to live our greatest dreams. == References == Category:Buddhism ","title":"The Nine Consciousness"},{"id":"60269302","text":"Lighthouse keepers are people who keep watch at a lighthouse.

It was formed during the early 1970s and is centred on Gerrard Street East between Broadview Avenue and Carlaw Avenue. ==History== With the expropriation of the first downtown Chinatown from the 1950s to 1960s as well as subsequent property values increased in the Spadina avenue West Chinatown, many Chinese Canadians migrated to Toronto's east end. The nascent East Chinatown community was formed in the Riverdale neighbourhood around 1971 when Charlie Cheung moved from first Chinatown and purchased a property at 383 Broadview Avenue to start Charlie's Meat, a Chinese butchershop. Other restaurants soon followed with the growth of the community, such as the Pearl Court Restaurant that opened in 1982. Pearl Court became a hub for many of the community's events including many involving Jack Layton, the MP for the area for many years. A street adjoining East Chinatown is dedicated to Layton. Chinese-Vietnamese and mainland Chinese immigrants dominate this neighbourhood. The East Chinatown community was heavily affected leading up to the 2001 by Toronto's bid for the 2008 Olympics and subsequently by the construction of the \\"Studio District\\", in South Riverdale next to the Toronto Port Lands. The land speculation in these construction project drove up property values, which prompted many of business and residents to migrate north to Scarborough, Markham, and Richmond Hill. As with many Canadian Chinatowns, the demographics of East Chinatown has been changing with gentrification and immigration. ==Neighbourhood features== Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is located in Riverdale Park near East Chinatown.alt= At the northernmost corner of East Chinatown (northwest corner, Broadview Avenue and Gerrard Street) is the Riverdale branch of the Toronto Public Library. This branch is bilingual in Chinese and English. North of the library in Riverdale park is a monument to the Chinese revolutionary and first leader of Republican China: Sun Yat-sen. There two streets with bilingual signs (English on top, Chinese on the bottom) located in the neighbourhood at three of the four corners of the intersections: *Broadview Avenue (百樂匯街, lit. gathering of a hundred joys\\") *Gerrard Street East (芝蘭東街) The neighbourhood is also the site for the only Chinese Archway (牌坊, páifāng) in Toronto, with its official construction beginning in late 2008 and opening to the public on September 12, 2009. The archway and parking lot next to where it is located has since won a prestigious international award in 2012 for Best Design/Implementation of a Surface Parking Lot. Chinatown East can be accessed by the 504 King, the 505 Dundas, or the 506 Carlton Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) streetcars. ==Popular culture== Bo Ling's Chop Suey Palace in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1983 film A Christmas Story where the Parker family eat peking duck on Christmas Day was filmed in East Chinatown at 744 Gerrard Street East.

Individual unit practices were held in the various military installations for all the participating units in the national and local parades. Unit practices within Moscow Oblast itself started in early March in the Alabino field and other locations before the full-blown parade practice run-throughs for all the participating units will commence later in the month. Officially the preparatory period for the parade kicked off on 26–27 March 2019 in the Alabino Training Range in Moscow Oblast, wherein the parade's more than 17,600 servicemen and women have been assembled to begin more than a month of practice rehearsal runs together with more than 190 vehicles from the Armed Forces, National Guard and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and around 3,800 crewmen. The first general practice run-through began on 3 April 2019 in the Alabino Training Range with only the ground and mobile columns making their runs, as the separate practice runs for the air flypast column began in the airfield in Kubinka just kilometers away from Red Square.https://www.5-tv.ru/news/245865/kak-prosla-pervaa-repeticia-parada- pobedy2019-godu-vpodmoskove- reportaz/https://vm.ru/news/617260.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-G6q4yGbgw On 17 April, the new parade limousines were test driven to ensure readiness for use during the final round of practice run-throughs and on the actual parade day.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxPopVLwJB0 On 19 April, Moscow 24 featured an interview with some of the gunners from the Moscow Garrison's state artillery battery, which have also been preparing to fire the ceremonial 21-gun salutes during the playing of the national anthem.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDQY8fe4v4 === Timeline for preparatory activities in Moscow === * 26–27 March towards 6 April – beginning of parade practice runs in Alabino, Moscow Oblast * 2nd up to the 3rd week of April – General practice run-through in the Alabino training field, including flypasthttps://www.armyrecognition.com/april_2019_global_defense_security_army_news_industry/russian_army_rehearsals_for_9_may_2019_victory_day_military_parade.html * 4th week of April until 2 days before Victory Day - practice runs in Red Square right up to the general practice run ** 29–30 April, 2–6 May – evening parade practice run-throughs ** 4–5 May – Air flypast practice runs ** 7 May – the general practice run at 10 am MST (set to be livestreamed) == Full order of the 2019 parade == A contingent of the Russian Ground Forces during the parade.

Celebrations of the holiday are held in almost all the former republics of the Soviet Union. One of the biggest parades outside the capital is to be held on Saint Petersburg's Palace Square, in a sort of final celebration of the diamond jubilee since the conclusion of the long Siege of Leningrad, which was marked with a parade there on 31 January. During that parade units of the mobile column sported Soviet unit banners perpetuating the Second World War lineage and service of these units. In addition, the Serbian Armed Forces held a parade in Belgrade on 10 May, honoring both the living Serbian veterans of the Yugoslav Partisans and the Royal Yugoslav Army in the Second World War and the veterans of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. == References== == See also == * Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 * Victory Day (9 May) * Victory in Europe Day * Victory Day Parades Category:Moscow Victory Day Parades Category:2019 in military history Category:May 2019 events in Russia Category:2019 in Moscow ","title":"2019 Moscow Victory Day Parade"},{"id":"60269440","text":"Thomas Bowen The history of Tobago covers a period from the earliest human settlements on the island of Tobago in the Archaic period, through its current status as a part of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Originally settled by indigenous people, the island was subject to Spanish slave raids in the sixteenth and early seventeenth century and colonisation attempts by the Dutch, British, French, and Courlanders beginning in 1628, though most colonies failed due to indigenous resistance. After 1763 Tobago was converted to a plantation economy by British settlers and enslaved Africans. Tobago came under French control in 1781 during the Anglo-French War, returned to British control in 1793 during the War of the First Coalition, but was returned to France in 1802. The island was recaptured by the British in 1803, and remained under their control until independence in 1962. The economy in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was entirely dependent on slavery, and most aspects of the lives of enslaves Tobagonians was governed by the Slave Act. The end of slavery came in 1838; coupled with a lack of money to pay labourers, Tobago planters resorted to metayage, a form of sharecropping, which remained the dominant mode of production until the end of the nineteenth century. Declining sugar prices led to Tobago's consolidation with other British colonies in the Caribbean and the end of internal self-government. In 1889 Tobago was combined with Trinidad to form the colony of Trinidad and Tobago, which gained independence in 1962. Internal self-government was re- established in 1980 with the creation of the Tobago House of Assembly. ==First Tobagonians== Tobago was first settled in the Archaic period by people who probably originated in Trinidad. The oldest settlements are in the southwest of the island near the Bon Accord Lagoon, and belong to a culture known as the Milford complex, was named for the shell midden near Milford, Tobago. These first Tobagonians have been associated with the Ortoiroid people, who were hunters and gatherers and are believed to have been \\"incipient horticulturalists\\" who relied on, and probably managed, a range of edible roots, palm starch, and seeds. In Tobago, they fished and hunted sea turtles, shell fish, crabs and land mammals (primarily collared peccaries and agoutis). No pottery has been associated with Ortoiroid sites. Sites belonging to the Milford complex have not been dated very precisely. Artefacts found at the Milford site, and other stone artefacts found elsewhere in southwestern Tobago, have been dated to between 3500 and 1000 BCE. Similarities between artefacts from those sites and artefacts from better-known sites at St. John and Banwari Trace in Trinidad led Dutch archaeologist Arie Boomert to conclude that the age of these Ortoiroid sites in Tobago is likely to be closer to the older end of the date range. Greenstone ceremonial axe from shell midden at Mt. Irvine Bay In the first century of the Common Era, Saladoid people settled in Tobago. Like the Ortoiroid people who preceded them, these Saladoid people are believed to have come from Trinidad. They brought with them pottery-making and agricultural traditions, and are likely to have introduced crops which included cassava, sweet potatoes, Indian yam, tannia and corn. Saladoid cultural traditions were later modified by the introduction of the Barrancoid culture. People of the Barrancoid culture settled in the Orinoco Delta by about 350 CE and settled in south Trinidad starting around 500 CE, resulting in a cultural exchange that modified the pottery styles in Trinidad. Elements of this culture made it to Tobago, either by trade or a combination of trade and settlement. After 650 CE, the Saladoid culture was replaced by the Troumassoid tradition in Tobago. While Tobago and Trinidad were culturally connected during the Saladoid period, there was now a cultural split as the Arauquinoid tradition became established in Trinidad, while Tobago became culturally aligned with the Windward Islands and Barbados. Diets remained similar to the Saladoid times, but the remains of collared peccaries are rarer, which archaeologists have interpreted as evidence of over-hunting of the relatively large mammals. Troumassoid traditions were once thought to represent the settlement of the Island Caribs in the Lesser Antilles and Tobago, but this is now associated with the Cayo ceramic tradition. No archaeological sites exclusively associated with the Cayo tradition are known from Tobago. ==Early historic period== Tobago was seen by Christopher Columbus on 14 August 1498, during his fourth voyage. Columbus did not land, but named the island Belaforme, \\"because from a distance it seemed beautiful\\". Spanish friar Antonio Vázquez de Espinosa recorded that the Kalina (mainland Caribs) called the island Urupaina because of its resemblance to a big snail, while the Kalinago (Island Caribs) called it Aloubaéra, believed to be a reference to the fact that it resembled alloüebéra, the giant snake which was supposed to live in a cave on the island of Dominica. The name Tabaco was first recorded in a Spanish royal order, issued in 1511. This name references the shape of the island, which resembles the fat cigars smoked by the Taíno inhabitants of the Greater Antilles. Tobago's position between the Lesser Antilles and the South American mainland made it an important point of connection between the Kalinago of the Lesser Antilles and their Kalina allies and trading partners in the Guianas and Venezuela. In the 1630s Tobago was inhabited by the Kalina, while neighbouring Grenada was shared by the Kalina and Kalinago. The Spanish raided Tobago to provide slave labour to the pearl fisheries in Margarita. This was authorised under a 1511 Spanish royal order which allowed the Spanish of Hispaniola to wage war on and enslave the inhabitants of the Windward Islands, Barbados, Tobago and Trinidad. After the establishment of a permanent Spanish settlement in Trinidad in 1592, Tobago became the focus of their slave raids. Spanish slave raids from Margarita and Trinidad continued until at least the 1620s, decimating the island's population. === Early European settlements === Seventeenth-century map showing the fort of Nieuw Vlissingen. In 1628 Jan de Moor, the burgomaster of Vlissingen in the Netherlands, acquired the rights to colonise Tobago from the Dutch West India Company. He established a colony of a hundred settlers called Nieuw Walcheren at Great Courland Bay and built a fort, Nieuw Vlissingen, near the modern town of Plymouth. The goal of the colony was to grow tobacco for export, but the colonists were also permitted to trade with the indigenous inhabitants. The indigenous inhabitants of Tobago were hostile to the colonisers; in 1628 a visiting warship from Zeeland lost 54 men in an encounter with a group of Amerindians whose identity was not recorded. The town was also subject to attack by Kalinago from Grenada and St. Vincent. The colony was abandoned in 1630, but was reestablished in 1633 by a fresh group of 200 settlers. The Dutch traded with the Nepoyo in Trinidad and established fortified trading posts on the east and south coasts of that island. They allied with Hierreyma, a Nepoyo chielf, in his rebellion against the Spanish. In retaliation, the Spanish destroyed the Dutch outposts in Trinidad before gathering a force which captured the Dutch colony in Tobago in December 1636. In violation of the terms of their surrender agreement, all but two of the Dutch prisoners were shipped to Margarita, where almost all of them were executed. English settlers from Barbados attempted to establish a colony in Tobago in 1637, but they were attacked by Caribs shortly after their arrival and the colony was abandoned. This was followed by a series of attempts to settle the island by colonists under the patronage of the Earl of Warwick. In 1639 a group of \\"a few hundred\\" settlers established a colony, but they abandoned it in 1640 after attacks by Kalinago from St. Vincent. A new group of colonists arrived in 1642 and established tobacco and indigo plantations. This settlement was abandoned as a consequence of Carib attacks and a shortage of supplies. A fourth English colony was established in 1646 but only lasted a few months. === Courlander and Dutch colonies === Fort James, formerly Fort Jacob, in Plymouth Duke Friedrich Kettler of Courland tried to establish a colony on Tobago in 1639, but the colony failed. Duke Friedrich's successor, Jacob Kettler, made a second attempt in 1642 when he sent a few hundred colonists from Zeeland under the leadership of Cornelius Caroon. This settlement was attacked by Kalinago from St. Vincent and the survivors were evacuated to the Guiana coast by Arawaks from Trinidad. A new colony was established on Great Courland Bay in 1654 near the ruins of the old Dutch fort at Plymouth. The fort was rebuilt and renamed Fort Jacobus. The settlement around the fort was named Jacobusstadt and included the first Lutheran congregation in the Caribbean. The settlers were a mixture of Dutch and Courlanders under the command of Willem Mollens, and they renamed the island Neu Kurland. A few months later, a Dutch colony was established on the other side of the island, under the patronage of brothers Adriaen and Cornelius Lampsins, who were wealthy merchants from Walcheren in Zeeland. The Dutch named their settlement Lampsinsstad, which was built on the site of the current capital, Scarborough. When the Courlanders discovered the presence of the Dutch colony, they attacked it and forced the Dutch settlers to accept Couronian sovereignty. Lampsinsstad grew through the arrival of Jews, French Huguenots, and Dutch planters from Brazil who brought African slaves and Amerindian allies with them after they were forced out of Brazil by the Portuguese. By 1662, the Dutch settlement had grown to 1250 white settlers and between 400 and 500 enslaved Africans. The Courlander settlement attempted to maintain good relationships with the local Kalina population, but was attacked by Kalinago from St. Vincent and Arawaks from Trinidad. From a maximum of about 500 settlers, the colony shrank to 50 people by 1658. In 1659, while Courland was at war in Europe, the Dutch colony mutinied and took control of the island. Fort Jacobus was renamed Fort Beveren after Hubert van Beveren, governor of the Dutch colony. In 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Lampsinsstad was captured and looted by Jamaican buccaneers. The fort was occupied by English forces from Barbados and then captured by French forces from Grenada before being recaptured by the Dutch in 1667. New settlers from the Netherlands re-established the colony in 1668, but were attacked by Nepoyo from Trinidad. They were able to fend off the attacks with the help of Tobagonian Kalina, but were attacked again by Kalinago from St. Vincent. At the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the colony was captured and looted by Barbadians. Battle of Tobago, March 1677 After the end of that war, a new Dutch colony was established in 1676, but was attacked by the French in March of the following year. The resulting naval battle resulted in serious losses on both sides, and the French forces withdrew, but returned the following year, captured the island, and destroyed the settlement. Fresh Courlander attempts to establish a colony in Tobago in 1680 and 1681 were abandoned in 1683. A final Courlander attempt to settle the island in 1686 was largely abandoned by 1687; the last mention of the colony was a small group of settlers encountered by a Danish ship in 1693. === Neutral Tobago === Claimed by both Britain and France, Tobago was left in the hands of its indigenous population after the 1690s. European settlement in Tobago had been \\"thwarted\\", to a large extent, by the combined resistance of the indigenous Kalina of Tobago and the mainland, and the Kalinago of the Lesser Antilles. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle in 1748 designated Tobago neutral territory. Amerindians from Venezuela who sought to avoid being forced to settle in Capuchin mission villages, and Island Caribs from St. Vincent who sought to escape conflict with the Black Caribs, were among the groups who settled there in this period. == Plantation economy == The Treaty of Paris in 1763 ended Tobago's status as a neutral territory and brought it under British control. A plantation economy was quickly established on the island. Under the direction of the Board of Trade, the island was surveyed, divided into plots, and sold to planters. Between 1765 and 1771 over of land were sold by the Crown for over £167,000. The upper portions of the Main Ridge were reserved as \\"Woods for the Protection of the Rains\\" and thus remained uncleared and uncultivated. The former Dutch town of Lampsinsstad was renamed Scarborough in 1765, and was designated the capital of Tobago in 1779. To defend Scarborough, the British built Fort King George on a hill overlooking the town. The population of British settlers and enslaved Africans grew quickly, and production of sugar, cotton and cocoa grew significantly. A colonial constitution was granted and an elected House of Assembly was created, with each parish having one elected member. The government was under the control of the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, who was based in Grenada. A credit crisis in the British economy in 1772 resulted in the bankruptcy of several of the merchant finance houses upon which the West Indian planters were dependent for credit. The sugar plantations depended on credit from these lenders to operate, and the loss of easy credit created hardships for the planters in Tobago. In 1776, they still owed the crown £69,000 for the land they had purchased, £30,000 in interest, with a further £740,000 owed to merchant houses. The outbreak of war between the American colonies exacerbated the problem by driving up shipping and insurance costs for the planters. The entry of France into the war in 1778 worsened the situation. While the white and African populations grew quickly, the indigenous population declined. In 1777 there were \\"a few hundred\\" Amerindians, but in 1786 there were just 24. Many departed for the north coast of Trinidad, where they settled in the Toco area. The last records of Amerindians in Tobago are from Sir William Young, who served as Governor of Tobago until 1815. === French rule === French invasion of Tobago, 1781 In 1781, as part of the Anglo-French War (an outgrowth of the American Revolutionary War), France captured Tobago. The island was ceded to France in 1783 under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, which left the existing constitution and laws in place and allowed the British inhabitants to retain their property and religion. The capital, Scarborough, was renamed Port Louis in 1787, and Fort King George was renamed Fort Castries. Elections in 1784 left the Assembly in the control of British planters. In 1785 they refused funding for the island's government, arguing that their financial position was too precarious. In response to this, the French government demanded that the Assembly provide an annual payment of 200,000 livres tournois, which they agreed to in 1786. A new Colonial Assembly was established with two elected members from each parish and two from Port Louis, and four unelected members—the governor and the three other senior government officials. Under this new structure, and with far less independence, the Assembly functioned primarily to approve edicts sent by the French government. While some British settlers left the island after 1783, most remained, and there was little French emigration to the island, so the white population remained predominantly British. Between 1782 and 1790, the white population grew from 405 to 541, while the free coloured population (which included both black and those of mixed ancestry) rose from 118 to 303. The slave population grew from 10,530 to 14,171, mostly due to the importation of new slaves, as the death rate greatly exceeded the birth rate. According to the census of 1790, the population of Tobago consisted of 15,019 people, 14,170 of whom were enslaved. The white population skewed male—434 of the 541 whites were male—while the free non-white population skewed female—198 of the 303 free people of colour were female, reflecting in part the fact that twice as many female slaves were manumitted as male slaves. In 1785, cotton was the dominant crop in Tobago; were dedicated to cotton cultivation and were exported. Sugar cane was cultivated on and of sugar and of rum were exported. By 1791, cotton exports had fallen to while sugar () and rum exports () had almost doubled. The French Revolution in 1789 caused a split between royalists and revolutionary sympathisers among the French inhabitants of the island. A new governor sent to restore royal authority in 1792 left for Grenada in 1793 and was replaced by a revolutionary governor. ===Return to British control=== The French surrendered Tobago to the British after the fall of Fort Castries (now Fort King George) in April 1793. The outbreak of war between Britain and Revolutionary France in 1793 allowed Britain to recapture the island. British forces from Barbados under the command of Cornelius Cuyler landed at Great Courland Bay on April 14 and attacked the French forces at Fort Castries. The French forces surrendered after a two-pronged attack by the British, and Cuyler reinstated the British colonial constitution that had been in place before the surrender to the French in 1781. Tobago was returned to France in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens, but recaptured by the British when war broke out again in 1803. France formally surrendered Tobago to Britain under the terms of the 1814 Treaty of Paris. The Haitian Revolution resulted in the elimination of sugar exports from the former French colony of Saint-Domingue. Planters in Tobago were able to take advantage of this shortfall and greatly increased sugar production. In 1794, of sugar were exported from Tobago, and this rose to a peak of in 1799. === Slavery === The Tobagonian economy in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was completely dependent on slavery, both for plantation and domestic labour. Slaves also provided labour as artisans, on fishing boats and merchant ships, and helped man the island's defensive fortifications. Sugar production dominated the island's economy, and more than 90% of the enslaved population was employed on the sugar estates. The remainder were employed in Scarborough or Plymouth, largely as domestic servants. The 1790 census recorded 14,170 enslaved people in Tobago. By 1797, the slave population rose to 16,190 and reached 18,153 in 1807, the year the slave trade was abolished. With the death rate among enslaved Tobagonians greatly exceeding the birth rate, the slave population declined to 16,080 by 1813. Slavery was regulated by the Slave Act (formally An Act for the Good Order and Government of Slaves) of 1775. Slaves were considered property, with no intrinsic rights, but were in fact humans with \\"faculties of reasoning and will\\". The Slave Act, like other slave laws in the British West Indies, was designed to ensure that in the course of acting as humans, slaves did not cease to function as property. Striking or wounding a white person, wounding another slave, setting fire to sugar cane fields or buildings, or attempting to leave the island were all punishable by death, transportation, or any other punishment a magistrate might choose. Slaves were required to carry passes authorising them to be away from their owner's plantation. If they were found without a pass, they could be arrested as runaways. Harbouring runaways was a crime, even for white people, and any plantation left abandoned for more than six months, and food crops growing on abandoned plantations, could be destroyed to prevent runaway slaves from gathering there. Plantations were required to plant of food crops for every five slaves to prevent food shortages. Over time, this was replaced by allowing slaves to cultivate their own provision grounds. Slaves were given Sundays and, on larger plantations, Thursdays, to work on their provision grounds and were allowed to eat or sell the production from these gardens as they chose. On plantations which allowed larger provision grounds, slaves were expected to use their own money to buy meat and fish. Where provision grounds were smaller, these were provided by the plantation owner. Urban slaves were unable to cultivate gardens, both because land was unavailable and, in the case of domestic workers, because they were not given the time to do so. === Emancipation and metayage === After peaking in 1799, sugar production experienced a long, slow decline. Income for planters fell more sharply as sugar prices fell from a high of 87 shillings per hundredweight in 1799 to less than half that (32 to 38 shillings) in 1807. The abolition of the slave trade in 1807 put further pressure on the planters; because the death rate among slaves exceeded the birth rate, the slave population was not self-sustaining. This drove up the cost of slaves, which impacted the cost of sugar production. Declining sugar prices led to a downturn in the economy of the West Indian islands, including Tobago. After Emancipation in 1838, economic conditions did not improve; the price of sugar fell from about 34 shillings per hundredweight in 1846, to 23 shillings in 1846 and 21 shillings in 1854. The 1846 Sugar Duties Act removed protections for British West Indian sugar, forcing it to compete with foreign-grown sugar, which was cheaper to produce, and beet sugar, which was subsidised. The main revenue stream for the government of the island was customs duties, so the declining value of sugar exports meant declining revenue. In eleven of the 21 years between 1869 and 1889, the government operated at a deficit. The 1884 bankruptcy of A.M. Gillespie and Company, a London-based financier which had provided credit, marketing and shipping to many of the planters, was a severe blow to the economy of Tobago. Given a lack of money to pay labourers, planters in Tobago resorted to metayage, a form of sharecropping which had been introduced to the Windward Islands by the French. In this system, planters provided the land, planting stocks, transport and machinery to manufacture sugar while the workers (metayers) provided the labour to cultivate and harvest the canes. In Tobago, metayers were frequently required to provide the labour to operate the sugar mill. The sugar produced was shared between the land-owner and the metayers. Normally, half the sugar went to the metayer, but if the land-owner provided a field of ratoons (resprouting canes that had been planted in a prior year) the metayer's share was only one-third to one-fifth of the sugar. The system was first introduced in Tobago in 1843, and by 1845 it was generally adopted. While the system was largely abandoned in the other Windward Islands by the 1860s, it remained the dominant mode of production in Tobago until the end of the nineteenth century, when sugar production was finally abandoned. == Union with Trinidad == As Tobago's economy declined, so did its importance to the British government. To reduce the cost of ruling the island, the British government sough to unite Tobago with neighbouring islands, into a single administrative unit. In 1833, Tobago, Grenada and St. Vincent were put under the authority of the Governor of Barbados, but this had little effect on the power of the Assembly. After Emancipation, the participation of the elected members in the business of the Assembly declined. Given limited participation and high rates of absence from the meetings, the Assembly voted to abolished itself in 1874 and replaced the bicameral legislature with a single chamber called the Elected Legislative Council. This chamber consisted of fourteen members, six of whom were nominated by the Governor and eight which elected by the planters. The planters initially objected to this reduction in their power, but this changed after the Belmanna Riots in 1876. Faced with growing militancy by the black population, the planters voted to dissolve their representative government and convert the island to a Crown colony. The collapse of London-based financier A.M. Gillespie and Company in 1884 further weakened the economy of Tobago. In 1885 the British government combined Tobago, Grenada, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia were combined into a single entity, the Windward Islands. This was a loose union while combined the islands under a single governor, but left local institutions intact. In 1887, the British Parliament passed the Trinidad and Tobago Act, which authorised the union of Trinidad and Tobago. The goal of the union was to pass the cost of administering Tobago from the British crown to the more prosperous colony of Trinidad. On 17 November 1888, the Act was proclaimed, and the union took effect on 1 January 1889. The islands were united under a single administrative structure, which was based in Port of Spain, and a single governor, who had formerly been the governor of Trinidad. The last vestige of self government, the Financial Board, consisted of three elected members, two members appointed by the governor, and a commissioner also appointed by the governor. The governor was able to dissolve the board without input from the people of Tobago. On the legal front, the Supreme Court in Trinidad gained authority over Tobago and had the power to appoint magistrates. Tobago's status was downgraded to that of a ward in 1899, with the warden of Tobago as the chief government official on the island. The lack of Tobagonian representation on the Legislative Council led to calls for someone to be appointed to the council to represent the interests of Tobago. In 1920, Governor John Chancellor invited T.L.M. Orde, manager of the Louis D'Or Estate in Tobago, to serve on the council, but Orde declined the invitation because it would have required lengthy absences from the island. A.H. Cipriani, a Trinidad resident who owned large coconut estates in Tobago, was appointed to the position instead. Between 1920 and 1925, Tobago's interests were represented by residents of Trinidad. Black Tobagonians were willing to serve on the council, but the prospect was not acceptable to the political establishment. === Representation === In 1925, the Legislative Council was expanded from 21 to 25 members, including seven elected members. Its one elected member gave Tobago its first elected representatives since 1877, when Crown colony government had been instituted. Voting was limited to literate men who were 21 or older, and came with property and income requirements. Requirements for candidates were even higher. The elections took place on 7 February 1925. Only 5.9% of the population were eligible to vote, and in Tobago only 547 out of 1,800 actually voted. James A.A. Biggart, a black Tobagonian pharmacist, was elected to represent Tobago in the Legislative Council. Biggart held the Tobago seat until his death in 1932. A white planter and businessman, Isaac A. Hope, won the by-election to succeed Biggart. In the 1938 elections Hope was replaced by George de Nobriga. The County Council Ordinance of 1946 divided Tobago into seven wards, each represented by two councillors. The introduction of universal adult suffrage in 1946 saw the election of A.P.T. James to the Legislative Council. James was a strong advocate for Tobago and pushed for increased infrastructural development. He was successful in getting pipe-borne water, schools, health centres, a deep-water harbour, and, in 1952, electricity. He advocated for increased representation for Tobago in the legislature, for separate representation in the West Indies Federation, and, later, for full independence. James lost the 1961 general elections to A.N.R. Robinson, a founding member of the ruling People's National Movement (PNM). === Economy === After the union with Trinidad, the economy of Tobago remained underdeveloped. Most of the population consisted of peasant farmers who supplemented their income working on the coconut and cacao estates that replaced sugar as the island's main export crops. Wages were extremely low, which allowed the plantation owners (primarily a group of fifty to sixty white families) to derive \\"substantial profits\\" even when commodity prices were very low. In the 1930s, white planters began renting their estate houses and outbuildings to winter visitors, and later invested in hotels and guest houses. In the 1950s, tourism began to replace agriculture as Tobago's main employer and driver of economic activity. == Independence and internal self- governance == In 1956, Crown colony government in Trinidad and Tobago was replaced by internal self-government. The 1956 general elections were a victory for the newly-formed People's National Movement, led by Eric Williams. Williams was appointed chief minister, but the governor remained head of the Executive Council. With the formation of the West Indies Federation in 1958, the Williams administration acquired more direct policy control over Trinidad and Tobago. In 1958, a Department of Tobago Affairs was created, headed by a permanent secretary. In 1962, Trinidad and Tobago became an independent nation. In 1964, the Department of Tobago Affairs was raised to a cabinet- level position, and the Ministry of Tobago Affairs was created, in part to deal with the added responsibility of recovery from Hurricane Flora, which had devastated the island of Tobago in 1963. === Economic development === In 1957, Williams put forward the Tobago Development Program, an economic development plan designed to correct \\"many years of neglect and betrayal\\" of Tobago by the Trinidad-based administration. Successfully developing Tobago was seen as an important way to make the case for a leading role for Trinidad and Tobago in the West Indies Federation; by showing it was able to successfully advance Tobago's development, Williams intended to show how it could do the same for the other smaller members of the federation. While the Williams administration increased the development spending in Tobago relative to the previous administration, only about 3% of the 1957 budget was allocated to projects in Tobago. Between 1958 and 1962, Tobago's share of the development budget was also less than 7%, despite the goal that Tobago's development should be given high priority. === Hurricane Flora === On 30 September 1963, Tobago was hit by Hurricane Flora, resulting in 30 deaths. About half of the island's housing was damaged to the point of being uninhabitable. The main export crops–coconuts, cocoa and bananas–were badly damaged, as was a large part of the fishing fleet. Despite government investments in agricultural rehabilitation, the importance of the agricultural sector declined while tourism expanded. The number of hotel and guest house rooms increased from 185 in 1960 to 448 in 1972, to 651 by 1982. === Secession movement === Starting in 1969, Rhodil Norton, a medical doctor and president of the Buccoo Reef Association (an association of tour guides), began calling for Tobago to secede from Trinidad and Tobago. His calls drew strong opposition from Trinidadian society and the ruling PNM government, including Basil Pitt, the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Tobago West seat. Other Tobagonians, while not advocating secession, supported the idea that Tobago was not treated equitably and that the central government had failed to keep its promises to Tobago. Despite claims that Tobago was neglected, Tobagonians were well represented in government—both Pitt and Robinson (the MP for Tobago East) held ministerial positions in the PNM government, while the Prime Minister, Williams, held the portfolio of the Ministry of Tobago Affairs. In response to these calls for secession, the government expanded its investments in Tobago. Despite this, talk of secession continued. The Tobago Emancipation Action Committee, chaired by Norton, issued one such call for secession in 1970. This prompted the police to establish surveillance of the group. === Black Power movement === Independence left the economy dominated by the elites—in 1970, 75% of the best land in Tobago was reported to be in the hands of local elites or foreign owners. The continuation of colonial-era practices after independence led to disenchantment with the ruling PNM administration. Inspired by a combination of Marxism and Garveyism, the Black Power movement was a response to both racism and colonialism. The arrest and trial of students from Trinidad and Tobago in the aftermath of the Sir George Williams affair in Montreal, Canada, triggered protests in Port of Spain which soon spread around the country. In Tobago, protestors demanded the end of strip- tease shows for tourists which employed local teenagers, and the restoration of public access to the beaches at Pigeon Point and Bacolet. Between 12,000 and 15,000 people took part in a march to Charlotteville, while school children in Roxborough organised an march to Scarborough. On April 21, 1970, amid ongoing unrest, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago declared a state of emergency and arrested most of the leadership of the Black Power movement. When called upon to help restore order, the Trinidad and Tobago regiment mutinied, but the mutineers surrendered after ten days. === Rise of the DAC === On 20 September 1970, Robinson resigned from the PNM. His resignation came in the aftermath of the Black Power uprising earlier that year, and he cited abuse of power by the Prime Minister among his reasons for resignation. Robinson, who had been accused of putting his support for his party ahead of the interests of the people of Tobago, was freed from obligations to the former. He formed the Action Committee of Dedicated Citizens (ACDC) and joined forces with the opposition Democratic Labour Party (DLP) to contest the 1971 general elections. On 3 April 1971, ACDC reformed as a political party, the Democratic Action Congress (DAC), whose platform included a strong plan for economic development and self-government for Tobago. Over concerns about voting machines and irregularities in the election process, the DLP and DAC boycotted the 1971 elections and the PNM won all the seats in Tobago and Trinidad. In the 1976 general elections, the DAC won both seats in Tobago; Robinson won the Tobago East seat while Winston Murray won Tobago West. Two months after the election, Williams disbanded the Ministry of Tobago Affairs, and transferred its responsibilities back to other government ministries. In Tobago, this was seen as an act of reprisal for the island's abandonment of the PNM. === Internal self-government === With the dissolution of the Ministry of Tobago Affairs, Robinson and Murray made the case in Parliament for internal self-government in Tobago. The main opposition party in Parliament, the United Labour Front, supported these efforts, and, after a long and contentious debate, the Tobago House of Assembly (THA) bill was passed on 12 September 1980. Elections on 24 November 1980 drew 63.5% of eligible voters, and gave the DAC eight of the 12 seats in the Assembly, with the PNM winning the other four. The Assembly met for the first time on 4 December 1980, and Robinson was elected chair of the THA. The establishment of the THA provided internal self-government in Tobago, but the Assembly remained subject to the central government. The THA bill allowed the Assembly to be revoked by a two- thirds majority in Parliament, and left the THA financially dependent on allocations from the central government. A revised bill, Act 40 of 1996, gave permanent status to the THA, created the position of Presiding Officer, and gave the Chief Secretary the right to work directly with the Cabinet on issues related to Tobago. == Robinson era == A.N.R. Robinson served as a Member of Parliament, Cabinet minister, Chairman of the Tobago House of Assembly, Prime Minister and finally President of Trinidad and Tobago. Between 1980 and 2003, Castara–born A.N.R. Robinson played a dominant role in the politics and government of Trinidad and Tobago, first as Chairman of the THA, then Prime Minister, and finally as President of Trinidad and Tobago. In the run-up to the 1981 general elections, the DAC, the ULF, and the Tapia House Movement resolved to work together to contest the election. The three parties fielded their own slates of candidates, but agreed not to contest the same seats. The DAC contested eight of the 36 seats in Parliament, but only won the two Tobago seats. After the election, the three parties formalised their relationship and operated under the banner of the Alliance. The Alliance formed an accommodation with a fourth party, the Organisation for National Reconstruction to contest the 1983 local government elections. On 8 September, 1985, the four constituent parties dissolved and formed a new party, the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR), with Robinson as its political leader. The NAR defeated the PNM in the 1986 general elections and Robinson became the third person to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. The Robinson administration invested heavily in Tobago, completing the Scarborough Deep Water Harbour and expanding the runway at the Crown Point Airport to accommodate larger jets and international air travel directly to Tobago. They also improved ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough. Infighting in the NAR government and the 1990 Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt left the administration weakened, and it lost the 1991 general elections to the PNM, led by Patrick Manning. The NAR was left holding only the two Tobago seats. The 1995 general elections resulted in a 17–17 split between the Manning–led PNM and the United National Congress, led by Basdeo Panday; Robinson's NAR still held the two Tobago seats and with them, the ability to form a coalition government with either party. The NAR chose to work with the UNC and formed a coalition government, with Panday as Prime Minister and Robinson holding the position of Minister Extraordinaire with special responsibility for Tobago. In 1997, Robinson resigned from Parliament and was elected President of Trinidad and Tobago. He retired from the presidency in 2003. ==See also== * History of Trinidad and Tobago * List of colonial governors and administrators of Tobago ==References== Category:History of Trinidad and Tobago Category:Tobago Category:British colonization of the Americas Category:French colonization of the Americas Category:Dutch colonization of the Americas Category:Former colonies of Courland ","title":"History of Tobago"},{"id":"60269441","text":"Josefina del Toro Fulladosa (May 23, 1901 – November 19, 1975) was the first woman to become a library school professor in Puerto Rico and the first woman to serve as director of the University of Puerto Rico library. She was instrumental in developing academic libraries in Puerto Rico and was a strong advocate for the academic status of librarians. ==Early life and education== Josefina del Toro Fulladosa was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the daughter of Emilio del Toro Cuebas (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico from 1909 to 1922) and Josefina Fulladosa. Her mother died when she was four years old; her father encouraged her to pursue her studies. She attended Simmons College in Boston, Massachusetts and received a Bachelor of Science and Librarianship in 1925, becoming the first Puerto Rican graduate.

Brown University School of Public Health assistant professor Lisa Littman created the term to describe surveyed parents' accounts of their teenage children suddenly manifesting symptoms of gender dysphoria and self-identifying as transgender simultaneously with other children in their peer group. Littman speculated that rapid onset of gender dysphoria could be a \\"social coping mechanism\\" for other disorders. ROGD is not recognized by any major professional association, with Littman noting that it is \\"not a formal mental health diagnosis at this time\\". Littman published a descriptive study in PLOS One in August 2018. Criticism was voiced by transgender activists, and two weeks after publication, PLOS One responded by announcing a post-publication review of the paper. In March 2019, the journal concluded its review and republished Littman's revised and corrected version. On the same day as PLOS One announced its post-publication review, Brown University retracted its press release promoting the study. The controversy grew as articles and opinion pieces, both critical and supportive, were published in mainstream media discussing concerns about the study's methodology and the validity of its hypotheses, as well as issues of academic freedom. == Publication == Lisa Littman, an American physician and researcher, coined the term \\"rapid-onset gender dysphoria\\" at the outset of her research for a descriptive study originally titled \\"Rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports\\". Littman's medical specialties are in preventive medicine and public health, as well as obstetrics and gynecology. Her research interests relate to reproductive health, gender dysphoria, detransition, and maternal and child health including prematurity and the use of substances in pregnancy. Littman joined the faculty of the Brown University School of Public Health in 2018 as Assistant Professor of the Practice in Behavioral and Social Sciences. Littman became interested in the possible role of \\"social contagion\\" in gender dysphoria among young people, and conducted a study by surveying around 250 parents recruited from three websites where she had seen parents describe sudden gender transitions in their adolescents. See also She presented preliminary results at a 2017 conference, and a descriptive study was initially published in PLOS One in August 2018. Littman's study described cases of a rapid onset of gender dysphoria based on reports by the surveyed parents, along with information that was collected about the children's peer group dynamics, social media use, and prior mental health issues. Littman speculated that rapid onset of gender dysphoria could be a \\"social coping mechanism\\" for other disorders, such as depression and anxiety caused by adolescent trauma. According to coverage in the news section of Science, the study found that \\"among the young people reported on—83% of whom were designated female at birth—more than one-third had friendship groups in which 50% or more of the youths began to identify as transgender in a similar time frame\\", which the Science coverage described as probably \\"the most explosive of Littman's findings\\". ===Correction=== The paper was met with a strongly negative reaction from transgender activists who stated that it had already been politicized, and that there was self-selection bias of the subjects that Littman surveyed, as she only surveyed the parents and not the young people themselves nor the health professionals caring for them. A critique of the original study's methodology was later published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior. Responding to negative comments, PLOS One announced two weeks after publication that it would open a post-publication review of the study's methodologies and analyses. In March 2019, PLOS One completed its post-publication review, and Littman's corrected version of the paper was published on March 19, 2019. In the journal's blog, PLOS One editor Joerg Heber apologized \\"to the trans and gender variant community\\" for the previous review and publication, saying \\"the study, including its goals, methodology, and conclusions, were not adequately framed in the published version, and that these needed to be corrected.\\" Heber noted that the hypothesized condition of ROGD had \\"not yet been clinically validated.\\" In a notice of correction prefacing her updated version of the study, Littman stated: PLOS Ones editor wrote that \\"the corrected article now provides a better context of the work, as a report of parental observations, but not a clinically validated phenomenon or a diagnostic guideline\\". On behalf of the journal, Heber wrote, \\"Correcting the scientific record in this manner and in such circumstances is a sign of responsible publishing\\", where further scrutiny was called for to \\"clarify whether the conclusions presented are indeed backed up by the analysis and data of that original study.\\" Heber later stated, \\"At its core, the survey of the parents stands as it is... We let the original results stand.\\" === Terminology === The term \\"rapid onset gender dysphoria\\", coined by Littman, first appeared in a July 2016 notice that was posted on four websites, recruiting parents to respond to a research survey that Littman described as \\"Rapid onset gender dysphoria, social media, and peer groups\\". In the title of Littman's poster abstract for the study, published in February 2017, the phrase appeared as \\"Rapid Onset of Gender Dysphoria\\". According to Littman, \\"Rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) is not a formal mental health diagnosis at this time.\\" She wrote: In a formal comment published by PLOS One at the conclusion of its review, Angelo Brandelli Costa wrote, \\"The level of evidence produced by the Dr. Littman’s study cannot generate a new diagnostic criterion relative to the time of presentation of the demands of medical and social gender affirmation.\\" Costa suggested, \\"Several procedures still need to be adopted to generate a potential new subcategory of gender dysphoria that has not yet been clinically validated. One of these procedures is the assessment of mental health professionals trained according to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines, interviewing not just the family, but the youth (longitudinally).\\" == Reactions == The 2018 publication of the paper led to controversies that included criticism and defenses of the study's methodology by social activist groups and by professional organizations. Disputes also arose among socially conservative and liberal opinion writers about academic censorship. === Institutional reaction === On the same day that PLOS One announced its review, Brown University took down a press release they had earlier posted about the paper. Responding to critics, Brown University President Christina Paxson and Provost Richard Locke said they had not infringed on academic freedom and stated that Brown's commitment to only \\"publicize research that unassailably meets the highest standards of excellence\\" required Brown to retract the press release after PLOS One opened an investigation on the paper in question. They said that \\"given the concerns raised about research design and methods, the most responsible course of action was to stop publicizing the work published in this particular instance. We would have done this regardless of the topic of the article.\\" === Social and political commentary === The reactions to Brown's removal of the press release from their website included criticism by a former dean of Harvard Medical School. Aside from questions about the scientific validity of the condition, the political implications of the alleged condition were a source of heated discussion. The hypothesized condition was called \\"a poisonous lie used to discredit trans people\\" in the op-ed section of The Guardian, while it was called an explanation for the experiences of multiple parents in the op-ed section of the Wall Street Journal. Publications such as The Conversation and Slate condemned what they saw as politicization of science by social conservatives, while Madeleine Kearns, a contributing writer at National Review, described the alleged condition as \\"particularly concerning\\" and called for further study. In Psychology Today, Rutgers University psychology professor Lee Jussim described the PLOS-mandated rewrite of the paper as an \\"Orwellian correction\\" where no errors had existed, merely \\"adding some additional discussion about limitations to the work and some minor reframing\\", but said the process of peer review had improved the paper. === Professional commentary === Following publication of the original report in PLOS One, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) released a position paper on the proposed term \\"rapid onset gender dysphoria\\" and the research, stating that the term is not recognized by any professional association, nor listed in the DSM or ICD lists of disorders and diseases. They said in summary \\"it is nothing more than an acronym created to describe a proposed clinical phenomenon that may or may not warrant further peer-reviewed scientific investigation.\\" They affirmed the need for academic freedom and scientific exploration without censorship, and that much is still unknown about the factors contributing to the development of gender identity in young people, and said it was \\"premature and inappropriate\\" to use \\"official-sounding labels\\" that might influence professionals or the public to reach conclusions about how or when adolescents decide to come out as transgender. WPATH concluded by warning against the use of any term intended to cause fear about an adolescent's possible transgender status with the goal of avoiding or deterring them from accessing the appropriate treatment, in line with the Standards of Care appropriate for the situation. The Gender Dysphoria Affirmative Working Group (GDA) of professionals involved in transgender health wrote an open letter to Psychology Today calling the study \\"methodologically flawed and unethical\\", saying it proceeded from \\"an overt ideological bias\\", and citing previously published criticism of the study stating that it had multiple biases and flaws in its methodology. They said the survey drew subjects from \\"websites openly hostile to transgender youth\\", and failed to account for this bias, instead basing its conclusions on the beliefs of surveyed parents who presupposed the existence of ROGD. Noting that Littman had not interviewed the teens, and had no experience working with transgender youth, the GDA criticized conclusions in the initial publication of the study about how teens arrived at a trans identity, saying onset may only have been \\"rapid\\" from parents' point of view because teens often delay coming out in hostile environments or when fearing criticism. The Pediatric and Adolescent Gender Dysphoria (GD) Working Group, a group of professional clinicians and researchers which has criticized gender-affirming guidelines adopted by organizations including the Endocrine Society and American Academy of Pediatrics, said ROGD \\"warrants further study.\\" The group pointed to \\"the rise in the number of teens and young adults coming to identify as transgender without any significant prior history of gender dysphoria\\", and to both anecdotal reports and research indicating that many suffered from \\"mental health disorders in addition to gender dysphoria.\\" The group expressed \\"concern that there may be elements of social contagion at work.\\" ==References== Category:Academic controversies Category:Medical controversies in the United States Category:Transgender studies ","title":"Rapid onset gender dysphoria controversy"},{"id":"60269523","text":"Mauro Martino is an Italian artist, designer and researcher.

Linden, is a Scottish poet, literary magazine editor and political activist. From 1969 to 2004, he published and edited the poetry magazine Aquarius, which, according to The Irish Post, made him \\"one of the leading figures on the international poetry scene\\". The journal was significant in the growth of British, Irish and international poets, and has been described as Linden's \\"crowning gift to literature — the nurturing and developing of poetic talent\\". ==Early life== Linden was born as an illegitimate child to Irish parents in Motherwell, Scotland. He was baptised as John Edward Glackin, but became Edward Linden upon being adopted by Mary Glenn and Eddie Linden (the latter being related to his mother through marriage), whom he came to regard as his parents. He grew up in the mining town of Bellshill, 2 miles from Motherwell and 10 miles south of Glasgow. In 1944, Mary died, and her widower Eddie, a miner, remarried a Scottish Presbyterian woman who disliked the young Edward. She failed to have him put in an asylum, so instead had him sent to an orphanage run by the Sisters of Charity. He never knew his biological father Joe (Joseph) Waters, but did know his biological mother, Bessie (Elizabeth) Glackin. Linden was educated at Holy Family in Mossend and St Patrick's in New Stevenston. At the age of 14, he was \\"released\\" from the orphanage, and often slept rough. He was put to work in a coal mine, and after being fired from this job, worked in a steel mill. He was also employed as a ticket collector and porter at Hamilton West railway station. Linden was rejected for national service conscription in the army as he was deemed underweight and suffered from a duodenal ulcer. Having been raised as a Roman Catholic, he also struggled with his homosexuality, and even sought medical treatment from doctors, but abandoned this after falling out with the staff. ==Political activism== Linden's political and literary awakening came when he joined the Young Communist League. \\"At that time, the Communist Party had education classes - not just Marxist classes, but in Dickens, in Shakespeare - that was another discovery for me. Then there was the Workers' Educational Association. This was my way of getting away from that place and that life,\\" he later recalled. According to his biographer John Cooney, \\"Linden sought freedom to explore his capabilities, away from what he felt were the dual Calvinist and Jansenist suffocations of the west of Scotland.\\" Linden is said to have \\"wavered\\" in his communism following Moscow's suppression of the Hungarian Uprising of 1956. In 2001, he said he was \\"a lifelong socialist\\". In August 1958, by then in his early 20s, the young Edward, who would be known as Eddie, moved to London to work as a porter at St Pancras railway station. That year, he met the Catholic priest Anthony Ross, who helped Linden come to terms with his homosexuality and encouraged him to take part in peace protests: he became involved with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Catholic Worker. This led to friendships with the journalist Douglas Hyde and Jesuit priest Thomas Roberts. Upon Ross's death, Linden wrote an obituary of him for The Guardian. An April 1959 article by Hyde in The Catholic Herald outlined the origins of the Catholic Nuclear Disarmament Group, for whom Linden would become secretary. He later noted: > It was some time at the end of the 1950s when I first came across a little > bookshop in Glasgow called the Freedom Bookshop. This was run by an > eccentric Cockney, Guy Aldred, who was then editing a paper called Freedom. > I saw a book entitled I Believe by Douglas Hyde. Also that day in that shop > I picked up the American Catholic Worker produced by a remarkable person > named Dorothy Day. The paper identified itself with the cause of peace and > reconciliation. The book told a story of a man who had dedicated his life to > Communism. At the time I was disillusioned but was still loosely attached to > the Communist Party and the Young Communist League. These two items were to > lead me back to a reconversion to Christianity of much greater social > awareness. In 1959, Linden arranged a meeting in Highbury Place for the Catholic CND which was attended by novelist Pamela Frankau, founder of the British version of The Catholic Worker Barbara Wall and John O'Connor, secretary of Pax Christi, the Catholic peace movement. According to Linden, \\"the whole idea was to publicise the immorality of the bomb\\": the group were affiliated the national CND, and a letter was sent to General de Gaulle to protest the French test explosion. The first Catholic banner was seen on an Aldermasteron March in 1959, with 200 people: 600 associate members were part of the organisation. By 1966, Linden had become less politically active, and gone to study at the Catholic Workers' College in Oxford; he has latterly been described as a Catholic who finds it difficult to believe in God. Meanwhile, in 1963, he co- founded the Simon Community, a charity in aid of the homeless, with Anton Wallich-Clifford, a probation officer at Bow Street Magistrates Court. ===Party membership=== Aged 16, Linden joined the Independent Labour Party, which had disaffiliated from the Labour Party some years previously, despite having played a key role in the latter's early years. The ILP had lost all of its MPs by this point, however, and Linden describes it as having been \\"in its dying days\\". It was his involvement with the Communist Party that led to him moving to London, but after several years, he came to the realisation that he was not a communist. He would go on to join the Labour Party and, aged 84, stated, \\"I've been a Labour man all my life\\". In spite of his early inclinations towards the radical left, he did not support the left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who led the party from 2015 to 2020, and voted for the centre- left candidacy of Sir Keir Starmer in the contest to succeed Corbyn. Linden declared himself \\"delighted\\" with Starmer's subsequent election as Labour leader. ==Literary career== ===Aquarius=== Linden had begun to organise poetry readings at the Lamb & Flag in Covent Garden, and in 1969, he started the poetry magazine Aquarius, which featured emerging writers. He was helped by the poet John Heath-Stubbs, and a donation from his friend, playwright Harold Pinter; it has been said that Linden was the inspiration for the character of Spooner in Pinter's play No Man's Land. Fellow poets George Barker and Peter Porter also allowed their work to be published for free. The first issue featured contributions from Heath-Stubbs, Barker, Stevie Smith and Kathleen Raine. The magazine was published every few years and ran to 26 issues in all. Amongst others, Aquarius published works by Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, Tom Scott and Kathleen Jamie. Writing in the Times Literary Supplement, James Campbell says that \\"the actual editing\\" was undertaken by figures such as Barker, Heath-Stubbs and Douglas Dunn, the latter being another Scottish poet. Linden raised the funds to keep the magazine going through the years, having started it with £4 capital and a loan from a friend. He was also helped by leading poet John Betjeman, who sent £5 for \\"good old Aquarius\\" every Christmas (adjusted for inflation, this sum of money would have been of higher value whilst Betjeman was alive). A poetry reading at the Houses of Parliament was organised by Linden in April 1976, chaired by Labour MP Jock Stallard, featuring Heath-Stubbs and Dannie Abse, whose brother Leo was then a Labour MP. Abse's work was published in several editions of Aquarius, including the Welsh issue. A number of editions were similarly themed, including Irish, Scottish, Australian and Canadian issues; others honoured Heath-Stubbs, Roy Fuller, Hugh MacDiarmid and The Poetry of the Forties. Linden was also a member of the General Council of The Poetry Society for many years, and in 1990, he was elected to its Executive Council. In 1991, the existence of Aquarius was said to be under threat, prompting a question in the House of Commons from Scottish Labour MP Brian Wilson to the Minister for the Arts, Tim Renton. However, this led to an Arts Council grant of £2000, and the magazine continued, with the publication of Aquarius Women in 1992. This special edition devoted to contemporary women's writing was guest edited by Hilary Davies, featuring contributions by Michèle Roberts, Jackie Kay, U.A. Fanthorpe, Carol Ann Duffy, Elspeth Barker, Marilyn Hacker, Helen Dunmore, Maureen Duffy, Fay Weldon and Elizabeth Jennings. Profiling Linden for The Guardian in 1993, John Ezard commented, \\"For several generations of writers he has been part of the cultural furniture\\". During the period in which Aquarius was published, Irish broadcaster Frank Delaney said that Linden was \\"a butler to literature\\", and journalist Auberon Waugh called it the best poetry magazine in Britain. In 1991, it was reported that the Conservative Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, was a subscriber. Linden edited Aquarius from his flat — which was described by The Guardian as a \\"spartan bedsit in Maida Vale\\" — until 2004. Throughout his activities in literature and politics, Linden was often known as Eddie S. Linden, the middle initial standing for \\"Sean\\". A Festschrift, Eddie's Own Aquarius, edited by Constance Short and Tony Carroll, was published in tribute to Linden himself in 2005. Marking his 70th birthday, it featured tributes from friends and contributions from writers who had appeared in the magazine, amongst them poets Seamus Heaney, Alan Brownjohn, Roger McGough, Dannie Abse, Brian Patten, Elaine Feinstein, Alasdair Gray, Paul Muldoon, Tom Paulin, illustrator Ralph Steadman, politician Clare Short (a cousin of the book's co-editor Constance), artist Craigie Aitchison, academic Sir Bernard Crick, former CND chair Bruce Kent, writer James Kelman and emeritus Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion. Heaney, who knew him in London, dedicated 'A Found Poem' to Linden. ===Poet=== As well as publishing poetry in Aquarius, Linden also wrote and gave readings of his own poems, such as 'City of Razors', which recalls the sectarian violence of his youth in Glasgow. He had been writing verse since his teenage years, and after moving south, was encouraged by Barker and Porter. He had known Barker's son Sebastian at Oxford, and in 1965 met his mother, the writer Elizabeth Smart, who adopted him as a protége; she was complimentary about the letters Linden wrote, and after Smart's death, he remarked that \\"She was a mother to me.\\" He was also friends with the novelist (and subsequently Hollywood screenwriter) Alan Sharp, who based the character of Sammy Giffen on Linden in his book The Wind Shifts, published in 1967. In 1980, City of Razors, a collection of Linden's poems, was published. It won praise from Pinter, Gavin Ewart and Lord Longford. Reviewing the collection, The Guardian said that Linden \\"can be seen to be a poet who shares with Paul Potts a quality of trusting helplessness before the world, a rare and moving state of awareness.\\" In April 1981, continuing his commitment to the renewed anti-nuclear movement, Linden appeared at Poets against the Bomb, an event staged by Kensington and Chelsea CND at Chelsea Town Hall. In a line-up that included performances by Pete Brown, Ivor Cutler, Gavin Ewart, Adrian Henri and Harold Pinter, Linden read his poem 'Hampstead by Night'. Sponsored by the Greater London Arts Association and the Arts Council of Great Britain, it was filmed and is thus a rare example of Linden's performance preserved for posterity. The film was premiered at the London Film Festival. The Penguin Book of Homosexual Verse (1983) included another of Linden's gay-themed poems, 'A Sunday in Cambridge'. A second volume of his poetry, A Thorn in the Flesh, was published in 2011. Linden has given readings of his poems on BBC One, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio Scotland, Radio Clyde and LBC Radio. He has also given live readings at venues in Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales, Paris, New York City, Canada and Boston. ==Tributes== Who is Eddie Linden, a biography written by Sebastian Barker, with illustrations by Ralph Steadman, was published in 1979, covering the story of Linden's life up until the launch of Aquarius. It later inspired a stage play of the same name, which was produced in 1995 at The Old Red Lion in Islington, North London. Written by William Tanner, the play starred Michael Deacon as Linden, receiving good notices and playing to packed houses. In June 1975, Linden was the subject of a portrait by Harry Diamond, who captured Soho artists on camera, and in October 1985, he was photographed by Granville Davies. Both prints are now held by the National Portrait Gallery in London. His 80th birthday was celebrated with a party at Conway Hall in 2015, at which he recited several of his poems. Barker's widow, the poet Hilary Davies, described Linden as \\"loyal and non-judgmental\\", and, comparing him to a meerkat, said he was \\"sociable, communicative, ferreting in corners for choice morsels and then delighting in showing it to the community\\". He was presented with a portrait of himself by London Irish artist Luke Canavan. In 2018, a different oil painting of Linden by Canavan was displayed at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters Annual Exhibition, which took place at the Mall Galleries in London. Linden's character is summarised by his friend Gerald Mangan in a pen and ink drawing of him arriving at the gate of heaven accompanied by Saint Peter, who appeals to a surly God the Father: > \\"He says he's a manic-depressive alcoholic lapsed-Catholic Irish working- > class pacifist-communist bastard from Glasgow. And would you like to > subscribe to a poetry magazine?\\" ==Bibliography== * City of Razors and other poems, Jay Landesman, 1980 * A Thorn in the Flesh: Selected Poems, Hearing Eye, 2011 ==See also== * Catholic Church and homosexuality * List of English-language poets * List of Scottish poets * List of Scottish writers ==References== ==Further reading== * Barker, Sebastian.

She was hired to head the IT systems merger for the different subsidiaries of VTB Bank. She started her career in the IT industry before working as President of Microsoft Russia. She transitioned to VTB Bank in 2007, working as a member of the Management Board, before leaving to serve in the Russian Government as Deputy Minister of Economic Development and also as the head of the Federal Agency for State Property Management. She was hired as Deputy President of VTB Bank in 2016. Her main initiatives as Deputy President include preparing the company for digital banking transformations, including artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology, as well as allowing customers access to their finances without visiting a physical branch location. A 2001 Wall Street Journal report listed her among the Top 30 most influential European businesswomen. == Early Life and education == Olga Dergunova was born in Moscow in 1965, in what was then the Soviet Union. She studied at and graduated from the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, focusing on computer science and economic cybernetics. == Career == === Early career === Before joining Microsoft Russia, Olga Dergunova worked as a sales and marketing director at a Russian IT company. She worked at various IT companies between 1992 and 1994. === Microsoft Russia (1994-2007) === Olga Dergunova was hired at Microsoft's relatively new Russian operation, which had only existed for 18 months. The operation at the time related to the licensing of the company's programs. She joined in part to gain a global perspective on the technology industry. In 1995, Dergunova was promoted to general director of the company's Russian branch, and she became its chair in 2004. At the time that Dergunova entered Microsoft, Russia was slowly being converted from a communist country into a capitalist country, following the fall of the Soviet Union. During this period of time, the two primary concerns of Western IT companies operating in Russia were a lack of demand for their products and the online piracy of their products. Software used to be sold in the country unlicensed, so the idea of licensed software was relatively new to the country. Over the course of her tenure, and in the general Russian market, the piracy of software has declined. However, piracy was still common in the country in the mid-2000s. One of her biggest roles was to explain the concept of intellectual property to Russian consumers, with the goal of decreasing piracy and increasing demand for the company's products. In order to improve the sales of Microsoft products in the country, she lowered the prices of the company's products and hired local residents to sell products to consumers. The programs were also translated into Russian. As a result of local hiring efforts, in 2005 over half of all Russian IT workers worked for Microsoft, according to Microsoft's estimate. With regards to intellectual property enforcement, Dergunova usually focused on larger counterfeit software sellers rather than individuals who download the products for personal usage or for small-scale distribution. === VTB Bank (2007-2012) === In 2007, Olga Dergunova left Microsoft Russia to join VTB Bank's Management Board. This occurred shortly after VTB Bank's initial public offering in London. Her switch to banking also occurred during the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. Her family members, including her husband who works in finance, taught her many terms necessary to operate in a bank. She was hired as a member of the company's Management board. She also worked as the head of the Second Corporate Block, serving the bank's major clients. She worked in this role from 2007 to 2012, before her appointment to the Russian government. === State Property Management Agency (2012-2016) === In 2012, Olga Dergunova was appointed to head the Federal Agency for State Property Management and to serve as the deputy minister of economic development. The agency is responsible for privatizing formerly state-owned businesses as well as managing government properties. The overall privatization efforts sought to close the Russian governmental's budget shortfall caused by the collapse of oil prices, with efforts peaking in 2016. One of the first businesses that Dergunova oversaw that had the potential to be privatized was Sovcomflot. However, that business had not yet been sold by the time she left her position. Another business touted to be privatized was VTB bank; at that point, the government owned 60.9 of its outstanding shares. However, that deal did not happen as well, partly due to the recovery of oil prices generating more revenue for the Russian government to avoid having to sell equity in its businesses. Overall, the privatization efforts sought to raise capital from Western investors in order to combat budget shortfalls due to both oil prices being depressed at the time as well as sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea. However, the agency led by Dergunova did not want to sell off equity in Russian companies at bargain prices, which would have reduced the government's control of the economy without a large enough return on the sale. On the other end of the spectrum was a decree for state-owned enterprises, such as Gazprom, to raise dividends. Due to the high degree of state ownership, a very large portion of those dividends, if not the majority, would flow to the Russian government and reduce its budget shortfall. Dergunova stated that raising dividends would raise as much as 100 billion rubles ($1.7 Billion) in additional government revenue. The lack of an acceptable sell price for equity as well as improving economic conditions in Russia stalled the efforts to privatize the economy. As of March 2019, the Russian government still owns the same 60.9% share of VTB Bank as it did in the past. The government also still owns 100% of Sovcomflot. In January 2016, rumors of Dergunova's departure from her government position surfaced. A report by Russian media outlet, Kommersant, claimed that Dergunova slowed down privatization attempts. On April 12, 2016, Dergunova was officially released from her position, succeeded by Dmitry Pristanskov. === Deputy President at VTB Bank (2016-present) === On June 24, 2016, Olga Dergunova rejoined VTB Bank, this time as the Chairman of its Management Board and as its Deputy President. Dergunova was put in charge of positioning VTB Bank's digital strategies. Her core initiatives include making it possible to do banking digitally without ever having to reach a physical branch location. To that end, she first oversaw the integration of all of the bank's IT systems, utilizing her past experience at Microsoft Russia. The 2017 merger of VTB24, the group's retail banking group, was a big test for merging systems into one comprehensive system. The IT merger put 20 million clients onto one IT system. Merging banking operations was critical to allowing 24/7 access to its banking platforms. At the beginning of her tenure, Dergunova sought to implement artificial intelligence into operations at VTB Bank, utilizing it to calculate credit risk. VTB Bank also used AI to automate the opening of accounts for individual components of companies. She also sought to utilize biometrics in its mobile applications and customer service centers in order to better verify a customer's identity and reduce the potential for fraud. In addition, in 2017, VTB Bank, along with other financial services companies, launched a 5-week Fintech Startup incubator to help develop different technologies. Also at the beginning of 2017, Dergunova sought to launch a new mobile application for VTB Bank, to be launched in early 2019. == Personal life == Olga Dergunova is married and has one daughter, Nina. She met her husband while they were both studying at university together, and they both work in finance together. She likes to play golf, ski, and go camping. == References == Category:Living people Category:21st-century Russian businesspeople Category:Russian politicians Category:Russian women in business Category:21st-century businesswomen Category:1965 births ","title":"Olga Dergunova"},{"id":"60269624","text":"Obrastsovo-Travino () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Obrastsovo-Travinsky Selsoviet, Kamyzyaksky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

He decided to settle in Bangkok and started a company called \\"World Lapidary\\". In 1976 Henry Ho graduated at the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in Santa Monica, California, USA. During this time, he met Robert Weiser, a fellow student and scholar where together they set up the Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences (AIGS) in 1978. ==Career== In 1997, Ho established the Jewelry Trade Center (JTC), Asia’s largest gems and jewelry marketplace. Ho led a conglomerate consisting of Thailand’s leading captains of industries. Bangkok Bank, TV Channel 3 and Central Group, were invited to take part in a venture to develop a plot of land measuring over 4.5 acres in Bangkok’s central business district on the most important business street, Silom Road. Ho also served in several capacities with the Thai Gems and Jewelry Traders’ Association (TGJTA), beginning from 1993 to the present. He served as the Vice-President of TGJTA from 1993-1995, and is an Advisor to the association. Ho also represented the highest and official diamond authority in Belgium, the Diamond High Council (1996 - 1999) by operating their Asian office, offering educational courses and promoting Belgian diamond interests. ==Notable activities== In 1996, Henry Ho created a special diamond cut for the Queen Mother of Thailand, Queen Sirikit, on the occasion of her 60th birthday. The unique diamond design was named The Queen Sirikit Diamond consisting of 60 facets and a combination of the radiant and brilliant cut diamonds to bring out the maximum brightness and dispersion of light to the viewer. Several years after the Queen Sirikit Cut was introduced, Ho created another special diamond for the late King Bhumibol Adulydej on the occasion of his 68th birthday. Patents for both of the above mentioned diamond cuts are held by Ho. In 1995, the Golden Jubilee, the world’s largest faceted diamond of 545.67 carats was purchased from De Beers by a group of Thai business people led by Henry Ho in 1995. It was arranged for the diamond to be given to King Bhumibol as a gift from the people to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the King’s ascent to the throne. The yellow- brown diamond was named the Golden Jubilee, blessed by Pope John Paul II and was received by the King’s daughter, Princess Matia Chari Sirindhom on his behalf in 2000. The diamond is now on display in the Royal Museum at Pimammek Golden Temple Throne Hall in Bangkok as part of the crown jewels. Ho also served as the Honorary Consul-General of Bhutan to Thailand from 1995 to 2008. ==Recent activities== ===The Ruby Heart of Love - World Ruby Forum 2017=== The Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) under the Ministry of Commerce collaborated with the Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences (AIGS) and the Association of Gemmology of France (AFG) to host the first ever World Ruby Forum 2017, an international academic conference aimed to establish ruby as Thailand’s most important exported gem. In conjunction with the World Ruby Forum, Henry Ho’s major activities during the event include the World’s Most Beautiful Ruby Contest and the Ruby Heart of Love supported by leading entrepreneurs.

Then, they are thinking about their past life. A few months ago, their childhood brother Ram (Chutti Aravind) and they both are living in a house for rent. Ram has a little respect on his house owner (Mayilsamy), but they both are not. Then, the film tells that Shiva and Vicky both have a YouTube channel called \\"Nenjamundu Nermaiyundu\\". One day, they went to a mall and did a prank. They both keep the knives on the necks of a big businessman named \\"Jeepakaran\\" (Radha Ravi) and a press reporter named \\"Nisha\\" (Shirin Kanchwala). Then, Jeepakaran realised that the two men are doing a prank and openly told them that both of them are doing a prank. In that anger, Nisha slapped Shiva. Then, Jeepakaran called Shiva and Vicky and asked them why are they doing these pranks, to which they said that they are doing the pranks for money. The next day, Shiva, Vicky, and Ram helped two beggars in Marina Beach, and Nisha sees this. She and Shiva both fall in love themselves, but they both do not know that the other one is loving themselves. The same day, Shiva and Vicky realized that Jeepakaran's PA (Put Chutney Rajmohan) is following them.

His son Anbu (\\"Idhu Adhu Illa\\" Ayaz) wished to be a reporter, but his father wants him to take over his business. An uninterested Anbu joins a TV channel. One day, he overhears a plan of a murder and plans to stop it. Unfortunately, he fails in the attempt because the people had not helped him, and he got killed.

In the second year of the Kan'en Era (1749), cold weather patterns severely damaged rice fields and other produce. Following the poor harvest, the annual rice tax was lowered by regional offices working under the Tokugawa shogunate within the Fukushima Domain and other areas. In neighboring Ko'ori, however, the regional government office raised the tax. This, after local farmers had applied a number of times for the tax to be lowered. Refusing to starve themselves in order to pay the tax, 17,000 people from the 68 villages within the Date district gathered to petition the office of the regional government. They organized through the circulation of a letter originally called the Warada Kaijou (わらだ廻状). The letter came to be known as the Tengu Kaijou Soudou (天狗廻状騒動) or the \\"Tengu's Circulating Letter Revolt,\\" tengu being a legendary creature known, among other things, for their speed. Following the revolt, the tax was lowered, but countless farmers were arrested and tortured. Saitou is said to have returned to the government office and surrendered himself as the ringleader, joining two other farmers who had been accused (蓬田半佐衛門・猪狩源七). The three were brutally tortured and subsequently executed on the riverbed bordering present day Date City and Koori Town on April 17th of the year following the revolt. Saitou was forty-two. This story was printed in the national newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun in 1908, reportedly angering the emperor. In 1918 a stone monument honoring the three men was constructed in the former town of Date (present day Date City). Six decades later, in 1979, a monument marking the site of their execution was erected through the cooperation of Date City, Fukushima City, and Ko'ori Town.

It was announced on March 18, 2019, alongside the 5th- generation iPad Mini. The device is similar appearance wise to the iPad Air 2, but features an upgraded Apple A12 Bionic chip, a slightly larger 10.5-inch Retina Display, support for Apple Pencil (1st generation), Bluetooth 5.0 and faster memory (LPDDR4X). It was discontinued on September 15, 2020, with the announcement of the 2020 iPad Air.https://www.techradar.com/amp/news/new-ipad- air-4-2020 ==Features== ===Hardware=== The third-generation iPad Air features an upgraded, 7MP front camera (used first in the iPhone 7 and up to the iPhone XS), compared to the 1.2MP camera found in the previous generation. However, it retains the same, older 8MP rear camera. The third-generation iPad Air has a 2.49GHz six-core processor, the Apple A12 Bionic chip. That chip has a 66% faster clock speed than the 1.5GHz triple-core Apple A8X in the second-gen. It also has a True Tone display, which allows the LCD to adapt to ambient lighting to change its color and intensity in different environments, and P3 wide color gamut to allow the LCD shows more vibrant colors. This iPad Air retains the Lightning port, keeps the headphone jack, and has a slightly larger battery of 30.2 watt-hours (up from 27.6 W·h), rated by Apple to provide the same \\"10 hours\\" of active use. ==Reception== The third-generation iPad Air received positive reviews. It was praised for its laminated screen, Smart Keyboard case capability, as well as a speedy SoC. However, it only supports the first-generation Apple Pencil, uses the 2017's 10.5-inch iPad Pro design and only has two speakers compared to four on the Pro models. In addition, while the current Pro models provide some support for HDR, the Air 3 does not. ==Hardware Issues== Some devices of this model, which were manufactured between March 2019 and October 2019, have issues where the screen may flicker or flash before permanently dying. As a result of this Apple released a recall program which allows users to send in their device for replacement up to 2 years from the date of purchase. ==Timeline== According to Macworld, Apple products use the convention 1 GB = one gigabyte (one billion bytes), meaning that 16, 32, 64 and 128 GB storage devices contain a total of 14.9, 29.8, 59.6 and 119.2 GiB, respectively. Formatting and apps take up some of this total storage, leaving 11.5, 27.5, 56.5 and 114 GiB available to the user. == References == Air 3 iPad (9) Category:Tablet computers Category:Touchscreen portable media players Category:Tablet computers introduced in 2019 ","title":"IPad Air (2019)"},{"id":"60269875","text":"Sizova Griva () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Novotuzukleysky Selsoviet, Kamyzyaksky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

They were originally from Calicut (today also known as Kozhikode). They later moved near Goa.

Her grandfather was a havildar and her father a tent pitcher in the British army. Both won medals. De Souza had seven brothers and one sister, none of whom attended school. Their mother often worked as a coolie, and therefore their grandmother used to take care of them. She was a Christian but still respected Hindu temples. It is from her that de Souza and her siblings heard the stories and Hindu fairy legends that she later narrated to Mary Frere. ==Life with Mary Frere== In 1865–66, Frere accompanied her father on a three-month tour through the Bombay Presidency of India, where he was the governor. Her mother was in England and not accompany them. Frere and de Souza were the only females in the group. De Souza narrated the stories to Frere in English, and Frere later wrote them down.

Until 1981 she was known only as J. A. Davis. Davis was born Jane Anthony in Warwick, Rhode Island, the daughter of Giles and Sara Robinson Greene Anthony. For a short while in 1838 she attended the Warren Ladies Seminary in Warren, Rhode Island; it has been posited that she studied drawing and painting at that institution. She married Edward Nelson Davis of Norwich, Connecticut, on February 1, 1841, and lived with him in that town for a time. On January 10, 1842, she gave birth to a child. The family moved to Providence, Rhode Island; there she gave birth to another child, her second, on April 26, 1847. In August 1854 she produced her last portrait, of Luella Hodges. She died of tuberculosis eight months later, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence. It was common for women artists of the era to sign their work using only their initials, and Davis was no different in this regard; consequently, it was for many years assumed that she was male. In 1981 collectors Sybil and Arthur Kern identified the artist by name, further confirming their identification with two later reports. She produced miniature portraits, working in watercolor and pencil. Most of her subjects are depicted in three-quarter view, at bust length. Often they are clothed in black. Several characteristics appear in many of her depictions: a ragged part in the hair, bluish coloring of the eyelids, a wide and colored horizontal band below the bust, and negative space between the subject's arms and body. The artist sometimes incorporated flowers into her compositions. Many pieces were signed and dated; some also included the subject's name. Davis is known to have produced over 200 portraits, mostly of residents of the areas in which she lived. Three of her unsigned pieces were at one time attributed to James Ellsworth, and later to Alexander Emmons; three others were attributed to Joseph H. Davis and Eben Davis. An undated portrait by Davis, Lady Seated in a Boston Rocker, is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10731 Another piece, a family portrait, appeared on Antiques Roadshow in 2003, where it was appraised at between $25,000 and $35,000. ==References== Category:1821 births Category:1855 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:American watercolorists Category:Women watercolorists Category:People from Warwick, Rhode Island Category:People from Norwich, Connecticut Category:Artists from Providence, Rhode Island Category:Painters from Rhode Island Category:Painters from Connecticut Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:Tuberculosis deaths in Rhode Island Category:Burials at Swan Point Cemetery ","title":"Jane Anthony Davis"},{"id":"60270118","text":" The Boeing Cargo Air Vehicle is an unmanned, fully electric cargo air vehicle (CAV).

Iran has an embassy in Amman. Jordan has an embassy in Tehran. ==Historical relations== ===Antiquity=== While there had been historical contacts between two nations, for most of Jordanian history, the country fell under various Persian rules, started from the Achaemenid Empire to the Sasanian Empire. Because of this, a lot of Persian cultural heritages and influences can be found in Jordan. Both were also later dominated by Islam, though Jordan went to become a Sunni one in contrast to the Shi'a aligned Iran. ===Pahlavi Iran=== Iranian–Jordanian relations under the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran was cordial, being pro-West oriented and hostile against communism. At 1950s, King Hussein of Jordan inaugurated Jordanian embassy in Tehran, officially established relationship with Iran. However, sometimes relationship went tense, as Iran under the Pahlavi had official relations with Israel, and its distance from the conflict over Palestinian question. Nonetheless, they were able to have a secure and healthy relationship. Hussein also made a number of visits to Iran under Pahlavi. ===Islamic Republic of Iran=== The outbreak of Iranian Revolution and subsequent establishment of an Islamic regime in Iran changed drastically relationship from positive to negative. Jordan immediately backed Saddam Hussein on the Iran–Iraq War of 1980s and Iran severed diplomatic tie with Jordan aftermath. Due to Jordan's support for Iraq, even during the Gulf War, it took a decade before Iran and Jordan could normalize its relations. On 2 and 3 September 2003, King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Tehran, making him the first Jordanian king to visit Tehran since the launching of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. Nonetheless, relations between two countries remain tense, with Iran seeing Jordan's alliance with the West as a threat; and there is little economic cooperation between the two countries. In 2018, Jordan ruled out economic ties, reasoning that Iran is not a member of the World Trade Organization. Jordan often accuses Iran as the cause of instability across the Middle East. ====Syrian Civil War==== Jordan's relations with Iran became even more complicated as Jordan unofficially came out against the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria (an ally of Iran), considering Iranian long-term presence in Syria as a threat to its security. ====Iraq==== During the rule of Saddam Hussein, Jordan maintained a \\"special status\\" with Iraq as it relied on Iraqi oil. Iraq also relied on Jordan during this time for use of its ports, as the UN had placed sanctions on Iraq for the invasion of Kuwait. This support of Iraq resulted in a complete severance of ties between Jordan and Iran on January 31, 1981. Relations since then have remained fairly hostile. ====Jordan's ties with Israel and Saudi Arabia==== Another key reason for tensions between Jordan and Iran is Saudi Arabia and Israel. For many years, Jordan heavily depended on Saudi economic assistance. Jordan also shares similar political structure with Saudi Arabia, both are Arab monarchies with close tie to the West and are both strongly anti-Iranian. Growing Iranian influence brought Jordan and Saudi Arabia closer, with both denounced Iran together in spite of the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Jordan also shares a close tie with Israel, since the Hashemites had unofficial relations with Israel throughout the Cold War until 1994 when the two countries established relations. The Iranian Government, which has been Muslim since 1979, has called for the elimination of Israel and pro-West Arab monarchies; prompting anti-Iranian reactions in both Jordan and Israel. Jordan was also believed to have been working with Saudi Arabia, Russia and Israel in an attempt to curb Iranian involvement in Syria. ====Qatar crisis==== Both Iran and Jordan had called to solve the Qatar crisis diplomatically in hope to limit tensions. Jordan, while has limited tie with Qatar, still maintains its diplomatic presence within the country, since Jordan is dependent on Gulf economically, especially after 2018 Jordanian protests. On the other side, Jordan feared the escalation of tensions between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates might give Iran an upper hand. ==Iranian network intelligence in Jordan== The threat of Iranian intelligence networks in Jordan has increased since the establishment of Islamic Government in Iran. In 2004, Jordanian King Abdullah II accused Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi, as an Iranian agent for providing to Iran ammunitions, weaponry and explosions to attack Jordan. In 2018, a top military commander of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, revealed that Iran has enough network intelligence data over the military movements, bases and its strength of a number of Arab countries in the Middle East, including Jordan; and has threatened to attack if they are provoked. ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of Iran Category:Bilateral relations of Jordan Category:Relations of colonizer and former colony ","title":"Iran–Jordan relations"},{"id":"60270302","text":"Uspekh () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Kamyzyaksky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

The gestures within the Italian lexicon are dominated by movements of the hands and fingers, but may also include movements of facial features such as eyebrows and the mouth. Theories persist as to the exact origin of hand gestures as a method of communication in Italy, however it is likely that they emerged through necessity as a universal, non-verbal method of communicating across different regional Italian dialects. Despite the majority of today’s Italian population speaking standardised Italian, hand gestures have persisted as a method of expression to accompany verbal speech in many regions of Italy, particularly in the Southern regions. Around 250 specific hand gestures have been identified, with the belief that they developed during a period of immigration in which seven main groups are believed to have taken root in Italy: the Carolingians, the Visigoths, the Normans, Saracens, the German tribes, French, and Austrians. Given that there was no common language, rudimentary sign language may have developed, forming the basis of modern-day hand gestures. == Historical background and development == The precise origin of hand gestures as a popular component of Italian communication is still contested. De Jorio interprets the endurance of hand gestures in Southern Italy in particular as a cultural legacy of the Romans, who used the art of chironomia in everyday communication and in oratory. The development of hand gestures is closely connected with the communicative phenomenon, and this non-verbal communication system cannot be formed within a short period. The early urbanization in Italy is believed to be the seed of capitalism there, which creates more opportunities for negotiations and bargains. The increasing demand of communication stimulates the wide use of hand gestures in Italy. In addition, the colonization stimulates the cultural fusion leading to the need of another language to communicate, hand gestures. According to research, Ancient Greek colonization along the Mediterranean coast including southern Italy can be traced back to the early eighth century BC. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, local language did not take a dominant position any longer, because of the arrival of new immigrants and colonizers from other regions of the world. The data indicates the seven main groups: the Carolingians, the Visigoths , the Normans, Saracens, the German tribes, French and Austrians. Additionally, Based on the extant funeral stone from the 5th century BC in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, two soldiers were recorded with the moment of hands shaking. This is believed to be the proof of gestures in Ancient Greek which passed to and affected Italian non-verbal communication generation-to- generation even more than language. To the 21st century, around 250 hand gestures Italians use in everyday conversation have been identified. The irreplaceable role of gesture in medieval societies especially in Renaissance is being acclaimed as the ‘une civilisation du geste’ by Jacques Le Goff. One reason that can explain the rich history of Italian hand gestures and one of them is about the cultural transmission and emotional expression during the period of Renaissance. Renaissance emphasized the restoration of human nature in the classical era with the aim of breaking the shackles of religion. At that time period, people have stronger willing to express themselves and attract the attention from other people with the aim of humanity liberation. By using hand gestures, they can gain a sense of satisfaction from delivering their thoughts. Therefore, Renaissance is a vial time point for the development of Italian hand gestures. Hand gestures were extremely conspicuous in Italy during the early modern period. This may be due to the emergence of highly populated, large city states throughout Italy, such as Florence and Naples, in which people were compelled to take up greater space through their movements and expression in order to be understood. The higher usage of hand gestures in individuals living in, or raised in, Italian cities is still observable in a contemporary context. === The Gesture Frontier === A ‘gesture frontier’ exists in Italy which separates the gestures used commonly in Southern Italy from those used in Northern Italy. This frontier is evident in the differing meaning of the 'chin flick' gesture. In Northern Italy, this gesture generally means 'get lost', whereas in Southern Italy it simply means 'no'. According to Morris, this is due to the ancient Greek colonisation of Southern Italy, as Greeks also use the 'chin flick' gesture to mean 'no'. A study conducted in central Italy proved this gesture frontier to be true; despite the mobility of the Italian population and the existence of nationwide media, the majority of the northern Roman population used the 'chin flick' with the Northern meaning, and the southern Neapolitan population used the Southern meaning. This separation is evident between Northern and Southern Europe as well as within Italy, for instance speakers of English and Dutch generally use gesticulations considerably less in their speech than Italians and Greeks. The heavy use of gestures in communication has historically been considered an indication of a lack of civilisation in Southern European nations by Northern European nations. == Role of gestures in communication == The continuation of hand gestures as a part of the Italian lexicon can be best understood as a form of cultural coding, as Italian children unconsciously imitate their parents and peers’ behaviours, causing them to develop gesticulating during conversation as an involuntary habit. The use of hand gestures has always served a dual purpose in Italian culture; a substantive purpose which contributes expression to verbal communication and indicates emotion, and a pragmatic purpose which can serve as a substitute to verbal communication. In a contemporary context, hand gestures are primarily used amongst Italians as a form of expression to accompany conversation rather than a substitute for verbal communication. The prevalence of hand gestures in communication in large Italian cities is thought to be due to competition, as individuals unconsciously wish to be more visible and take up more space in a busy urban setting by adding physical elements to their communication. === Communication vs Information === Pointing left ==== Communication ==== Communicative postures would be named active postures, since it is given on purpose by individuals. For example, when a speaker is enthusiastic to deliver important information to his audience, he might tries to emphasis on hand gestures rather than the speech. A good example is about the picture of Uncle Sam, who is pointing his index finger directly towards you which is seen as a strong expression. ==== Information ==== Informative gestures or passive postures refer to the hand movements that are not necessary or meaningful to the conversation, such as behaviors in scratching, adjusting clothing, and tapping. Since this part of gesture does not focus on communication, it usually does not involve extra verbal communication. == Classification of Italian hand gestures == There are two main ways to classify the Italian hand gestures. The first way is to distinguish them via the occasions them used, such as religious rites, gladiatorial arenas and daily conversation. Another way is to differentiate the communicative and informative hand gestures in the Italian language system. These two types gestures might occur automatically, whereas informative-communicative dichotomy is used to explore the actual intention of them behind the conversation.left === Religious Rites === In the oldest surviving Annunciation image,icons of the Annunciation, it can be found that the Archangel Gabriel is generally raised his hand before he started to mention something important. And this kind of gesture had been amply manifested by the behaviors of Roman rhetoricians when they were about to emphasis a key point. Until now, this kind of tradition still affects the conversation of Italians to begin an exordium. === Gladiatorial Arenas === Pollice Verso (1872), which popularized the \\"thumbs down\\" gesture. Oil on canvas, Phoenix Art Museum259x259px More recent researches suggest that the use of thumb up and thumb down originates from Rome in the gladiatorial arenas, to decide the destiny of the loser in that fight. The loser may beg for mercy to the crowd, who would decide his fate by showing thumbs up or down. If he received more thumbs-up gestures than the thumbs-down, then the gladiator was to be spared. Thumbs down, on the other hand, signified execution. However, there is still a controversial around scholars about the exact meaning of thumb-up and thumb-down in ancient Rome. === Daily Routine === The habit of talking with one's hands in Italy has been reported to address and reinforce the meaning of expressions. An icon symbol of Italian gesture is the movement of hand with an up-down activity. Under normal conversation, gesturing helps in delivering the meaning and receiving information. For example, when an Italian is begging for a help, he would put his palms together with fingers extended and press. Due to the difference in local context and cultural background, Italian has its own hand gestures system which might no always has the same use in different region even for Northern and Southern region. == Basic gestures == The following section introduces some common and useful gestures used regularly in Italian conversation with words described. * Finger purse (various meanings, often \\"what do you want/what do you mean\\" - Keep your fingers together, with tips touching and pointing upward. Arm is about a foot distance away from the body. Hands can move up and down at the wrist or be held. * Please do me a favor - Put your palms devoutly and press them in front of the chest. * Excellent - Bunch ten fingers together and lift them to the same height as mouth. Then use hand to touch the lips. * Perfect - The thumb and index finger form a circle, with the other three fingers extended and draw a straight vertical line or relaxed. Also called an OK gesture. * Delicious - Put one index finger on the cheek or touch tips of all fingers of one hand together and kiss them while extending the arm away from the mouth. * Think twice - Extend the index finger and point it to one side of the head. * Watch out! - Using your index finger, tugging at your bottom eyelid. * I swear - Form an X in front of the chest by using two index fingers. * See you later - Use one index finger and extend it to draw a small circle in the air. * Eat spaghetti - Index and middle finger imitate a fork picking up spaghetti and turn the elbow downwards. * Dramatic change - Place the palm facing downwards, then flip palm hand over to the facing upwards position. * Let's go - With the palm facing inwards, flatten your fingers except thumb, after that shake hand in an up and down movements several times. *Asking another person for a cigarette - Index and middle finger form a V shape pointing upwards, as the hand is brought towards and away from the mouth. *The Chin Flick - Person quickly tips their heads backwards while making a ntze noise with the mouth. In Southern Italy and other countries in the Mediterranean, means 'no'. In Northern Italy and other countries such as France, means 'get lost'. *“Get lost” - The arm is outstretched, hand is flat. Wrist moves up and down. Used either ironically or maliciously. *Indication of disbelief - heels of hands and fingertips are pressed together to form a round shape, hands move up and down. *“L’ombrello” - The Umbrella - common profanity. One arm bends facing upwards, the other slaps the crook of the bent arm's elbow. == Benefits == The elaboration of hand and daily communication shows some advantages and the use of gestures help the Italian's expression more easy-understanding which is believed by psychologists. There are some reasons to explain that. * Hand gestures reflect the thoughts inside speaker's mind Hand gesture act as a proxy to turn intangible thoughts into hand movements presenting the idea in a direct way. Recently, more researches have improved that there is a link between the cognition and action. For instance, Broca's area a brain region functions an important role in speaking. In addition, this area is active at the same time when there is a hand movement. * Gesturing helps understanding Effective communication, notably teaching, is a central application of cognitive psychology. Explaining processes that occur over time is especially challenging, primarily because of the complexity of the sequence of actions and their causes and consequences. Adding gestures that are crafted to congruently represent the actions to the verbal explanation deepens understanding of the actions and the system as a whole. Gestures are especially effective because they can both resemble and represent and also embody action. As a consequence, gesturing is also regarded as a \\"second language\\". Italians use the hand movements in conjunction with their own language to convey the information, hence oral communication is supplemented by the gestures. * Early hand gestures in childhood predicts a development for children There is a conducted experiment based on the effects about hand gestures to children, it is found that hand gestures used at 14 months was an important indicator of the size of vocabulary at 42 months, significantly outweigh the vocabulary size of normal children who only affected by the parents and child words at 14 months. Not only for language system, early gesturing immersive environment has a potential effect on individual's personality. Until now there is not a supportable evidence to explain the relationship between gesturing habit and biological genes. Whereas, it is found that people who prefer to use gesturing during their conversation tend to be defined with warm, agreeable and energetic characteristic, while less animated speakers are relatively logical, cold and analytical. == References == Category:Hand gestures Category:Italian language ","title":"Gesticulation in Italian"},{"id":"60270443","text":"John William Kneller (October 15, 1916-July 2, 2009) was an English-American French language professor and scholar, and the fifth President of Brooklyn College. ==Biography== Kneller was born in Oldham, England, to John W.

It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. ==History== Esplanaden No. 4 and No. 6 was originally one lot. The house, which had a large garden, was one of the first houses at Toldbodvej (later Rsplanaden). It was from 1750-79 owned by bell-ringer at the Church of Holmen Oluf Bang (1710-1783). The house, a two-storey, timber-framed building, sight bays wide and with a central gateway, was a little pulled back from the road. To the rear of it was another building, also is two storeys and with timber framing. The courtyard featured a small wooden shed and a water pump. The large garden featured to open pavilions and an espalier. . Oluf Bang moved to the corner of Reverensgade and Vingårdsstræde and his house at Toldbodvej was ub i 1779 acquired by sea captain and destiller Christian Rasmussen Lihme (1731-1784) and goldsmith and brewer Jens Sander Schouw (1724-1798), Schouw, who lived in Laksegade from 1763-96, was from 1778 to 1794 also the owner of another house at Toldbodvej. Lihme drowned at New Guinea in 1784. Johannes Caspersen, who had recently married Anna Dorothea Weilbach (1763-1841), purchased the property at Toldbodvej in 1783. Johannes Caspersen's father, Hans Caspersem, who was anchor smith at Asiatisk Plads, had constructed several houses in Christianshavn. Johannes Caspersen lived with his family in the house at Toldbodvej for a few years but then moved to one of his father's houses at Overgaden neden Vandet 33 and sold the property at Toldbodvej to his father in 1785. Hans Caspersen demolished the house at Toldbodvej and divided the property into two lots. The house at No. 4 had been completed by June 1787. Caspersen sold it to destiller Jens Jørgen Fæster (1747-1825) in 1789 but reacquired it in 1792 only to sell it to master tailor Johannes Simonsen Schiøtz (1755-1823) and his brother, miller in Korsør, Niels Simonsen Schiøtz (1760-1820). Esplanaden 6 under construction The building at No. 6 was also completed in 1787. In the courtyard was an 11-bay wooden shed with tile roof, a washhouse and a smithy. Johannes Caspersen and his family were most likely originally meant to move back to the building on its completion but this never happened. Hans Caspersen purchased an old house in Kongensgade (now Wildersgade 38) in 1791, demolished it and constructed a new one for the son. Johannes Caspersen bought it from his father in 1796 and lived there until 1811. The property on Toldbodvej was on 30 June 1791 sold to commander captain Peter Ramshart (1741-1813). A total of nine families lived in the building at the 1801 census. The owner, now with rank of counter admiral, lived there with his second wife Fredericia Christine Schmidt (1752-1810), their four children, the wife's younger sister, servants and a service-runner. A new owner, Christian Michael Rottbøll (1805-1894), an assessor (law), lived in the building with his wife Gunhild Marie (1815-1902) and five children at the time of the 1834 census. The 36-year-odl art historian Niels Lauritz Høyen, was a resident in the rear wing. The property changed hands several times over the next decade. In 1844, it was taken over by the Guard Hussar Barracks on the other side of the street. The barracks closed in 1896. The buildings were demolished when Grønningen was created. ==Architecture== The rear side of the building The main entrance The buildings was probably designed by Andreas Kirkerup. It is constructed in red brick with plinth, cornices and window frames in Bornholmian granite. The building is seven bays wide and has a median risalit. The first floor features three-bay balcony supported by corbels. One of the corbels features a relief of an anchor. The reliefs on the three other corbels are slurred. The lowest floor and high cellar was merged into a new ground floor with mezzanine. ==References== ==External links== Category:Listed residential buildings in Copenhagen Category:Neoclassical architecture in Denmark ","title":"Esplanaden 6"},{"id":"60270489","text":"José de Alcíbar - The Blessing of the Table José de Alcíbar, or Alzíbar (1725/30 - 1803, Mexico City) was a Mexican painter, of Basque origin;Eusko Ikaskuntza active from 1751 to 1801. ==Biography== He may have been a student of José de Ibarra and is known to have worked in the studios of Miguel Cabrera.

The boat's departure and arrival point was Vancouver, British Columbia, though an unauthorised stop was made in Akutan, Alaska, resulting on a U.S. Coast Guard boarding and a charge of a U.S. customs violation. The crew's sight of a grisly, abandoned whaling station in Akutan was compared to the Communist Party of Kampuchea's Khmer Rouge Killing Fields and it was called a \\"pivotal\\" moment that turned Greenpeace on to the idea of saving the whales. ==1975 Greenpeace charter== In June 1975, the Phyllis Cormack was chartered by the Greenpeace Foundation, a Vancouver, B.C. ecological organization, to harass USSR and Japanese whaling; the crew included persons fluent in Japanese and in Russian.

In her seven decade career Teed often depicted groups of people gathered together in social occasions and also landscapes and geological formations. ==Biography== Teed was born in Bristol and attended Badminton School before studying at the West of England College of Art from 1949 to 1954. After she graduated she spent a year teaching at St Brandon's School in Somerset and then, after marrying Peter Teed, spent three years in Australia. In Australia she met the curator John Brock, who was a great influence on her art, and had an exhibition in Melbourne. In 1959 Teed returned to England and lived in first Surrey, before settling in Goole in 1964 when her husband was given a post at Goole Grammar School. Eventually he was appointed headmaster of the school, a position he held for some twenty-one years.

Her first poetry collection, We’ll Work Tomorrow (מחר נעבוד) came out in 2014. The book won the Bernstein Literature Award for 2015. Hakimi edited the children's book Afternoon Kids (Tangier, 2015) by Avihai Nizri, illustrated by Liron Cohen. Her second book, In the Water, is a graphic novel, created in collaboration with illustrator Liron Cohen; it was published in 2016. Hakimi's next book, her first published prose work, is Company. The word in Hebrew, Hevra means company as translated to English – both in the commercial sense and as in 'keeping company' – but it also means 'society'. The book deals with the minutiae as well as all the big questions of a body in the never-ending cycle of 21st century work – from a woman's perspective, outlining the expected aspects of corporate work, with the additional aspects of sexual harassment, taking care of home and children, and other issues, as Hakimi stated: \\"The world of work was planned for the work of men. A woman at work is a priori a strange thing. It isn't just because she has another internal cycle. From salaries to opportunities for advancement, through the issues of everyday maltreatment and harassment – workplaces are still not equal for women.\\" In his review in Ha'aretz, Amos Noy wrote: \\"Great literature is created at the meeting point between experience and language. And 'Company', Tehila Hakimi's new book, is great literature in my opinion.\\" Yoni Livne, writing for ynet, opined, \\"This is what would result if Kubric and Bowie worked in an office.\\" Neta Amit, in the online feminist magazine Politically Corret, wrote: \\"She is telling us... Don't make me choose; I am a woman and a mechanical engineer. A Mizrahi, and a poet. An engineer and an author. This expectation that we must choose – one profession, one identity – is meant to actually fit us into a mold that is comfortable for (the patriarchal, capitalistic) society. To fit you into a box, which will more than likely reduce you, but will enable the 'Company' [society] to embrace you.\\" Hakimi received the Emerging Poets Award from the Ministry of Culture in 2015. Among the reasons cited for the award: \\"Her poems indicate that her watchful eye and her sensitive gaze miss no detail, and give no quarter.

Since then, Hungary and Vietnam have developed further relations, with Vietnamese students and workers often going to Hungary to pursue higher education. During the 1980s, at the height of Cambodian–Vietnamese War, Hungary adopted a neutral policy and remained distanced from the conflict.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán visited Vietnam in 2017. Vietnam considers Hungary an important economic and key partner in Central Europe, due to its diverse ties and rich history. The two countries developed a strategic partnership in 2018, with the Hungarian Prime Minister referring to Vietnam as a success in the Far East. ==Vietnamese people in Hungary== The Vietnamese community in Hungary is small and, despite historic immigration, Vietnamese tend to be less active and well-integrated into Hungarian society.

The term was coined by feminist scholar Cordelia Fine in a 2008 article and popularised by her 2010 book Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences. The concept is now widely used by critics of the neuroscience of sex differences in neuroscience, neuroethics and philosophy. == Definition == Neuroscientist Gina Rippon defines neurosexism as follows: \\"'Neurosexism' is the practice of claiming that there are fixed differences between female and male brains, which can explain women’s inferiority or unsuitability for certain roles.\\" For example, \\"this includes things such as men being more logical and women being better at languages or nurturing.\\" Fine and Rippon, along with Daphna Joel, state that \\"the point of critical enquiry is not to deny differences between the sexes, but to ensure a full understanding of the findings and meaning of any particular report.\\" Many of the issues they discuss to support their position are \\"serious issues for all areas of behavioral research\\", but they argue that \\"in sex/gender differences research... they are often particularly acute.\\" The topic of neurosexism is thus closely tied to wider debates about scientific methodology, especially in the behavioral sciences. ==History== The history of science contains many examples of scientists and philosophers drawing conclusions about the mental inferiority of women, or their lack of aptitude for certain tasks, on the basis of alleged anatomical differences between male and female brains. In the late 19th century, George J. Romanes used the difference in average brain weight between men and women to explain the \\"marked inferiority of intellectual power\\" of the latter. Absent a sexist background assumption about male superiority, there would be nothing to explain here. Despite these historical pseudo-scientific studies, Becker et al. argue that \\"for decades\\" the scientific community has abstained from studying sex-differences. Larry Cahill asserts that today there is a widely held belief in the scientific community that sex-differences do not matter to large parts of biology and neuroscience, apart from explaining reproduction and the workings of reproduction hormones. Although overtly sexist statements may no longer have a place within the scientific community, Cordelia Fine, Gina Rippon and Daphna Joel contend that similar patterns of reasoning still exist. They claim that many researchers who make claims about gendered brain differences fail to provide sufficient warrant for their position. Philosophers of science who believe in a value-free normative standard for science find the practice of neurosexism particularly problematic. They hold that science should be free from values and biases, and argue that only epistemic values have a legitimate role to play in scientific inquiry. However, contrary to the value-free ideal view, Heather Douglas argues that 'value-free science is inadequate science' == Examples in Science == === Prenatal Hormone Theory === Contemporary research continues in a more subtle vein through Prenatal Hormone Theory. According to the Prenatal Hormone Theory, \\"male and female foetuses differ in testosterone concentrations beginning as early as week 8 of gestation [and] the early hormone difference exerts permanent influences on brain development and behaviour.\\" Charges of neurosexism may then be moved against the PHT if these alleged hormonal differences are interpreted as causing the male/female brain distinction and in turn are used to reinforce stereotypical behaviours and gender roles. === Empathising-Systematising Theory === Main article: Empathizing–systemizing theory The notion that there are hard-wired differences between male and female brains is particularly explicit in Simon Baron-Cohen's empathising- systematising (E-S) theory. Empathy is defined as the drive to identify and respond appropriately to emotions and thoughts in others, and systematising is defined as the drive to analyse and explore a system, isolate the underlying rules that govern the behaviour of that system, and build new systems. These two characteristics can be seen amongst young girls and boys. Girls have a tendency to play with baby dolls when they are young, enacting their social and emotional skills. Boys tend to play with plastic cars, illustrating a more mechanical, system-driven mind. This may be of course due simply to the environment and to social norms. However, the empathising-systematising theory posits three broad brain types, or organisation structures: type E, the empathiser; type S, the systematiser; type B, the 'balanced brain'. Given that females are twice as likely to display brain type E, and males are twice as likely to display brain type SAuyeung, B., Wheelwright, S., Allison, C. et al. J Autism Dev Disord (2009) 39: 1509. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-009-0772-x, he labels these brain 'types' the 'female brain' and the 'male brain', respectively. This type of analysis suggests therefore that most (or at least some) differences in skills and occupation between males and females can be explained by virtue of them having different brain structures. Baron Cohen's theory has been criticised because it presents a clear-cut dichotomy between male and female brains, whilst this is not necessarily the case: there are females with 'male brains', and males with 'female brains'. Using the gendered labels makes it significantly more likely that evidence of gendered brain differences will be over-stated in the media, in way that might actively shape the gender norms within society. === Neuroimaging === In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine criticises work by Ruben and Raquel Gur and collaborators. In the context of explaining the under-representation of women in science and mathematics, she quotes them as claiming that \\"the greater facility of women with interhemispheric communications may attract them to disciplines that require integration rather than detailed scrutiny of narrowly characterized processes.\\" This contention is however corroborated by a 2014 studyIngalhalikar, Madhura, et al. \\"Sex differences in the structural connectome of the human brain.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111.2 (2014): 823-828. about the structural connectome. The study used 949 youths to establish novel sex differences, establishing the key difference that male brains are optimised for intrahemispheric communication, while female brains are optimised for interhemispheric communication. Furthermore, the development timeframe of male and female brain are vastly different. However, this study used youths from age 8 to 22, where the brain is still developing so the results may not be conclusive enough. In a 1999 study, Gur et al. found a link between the amount of white matter in a person's brain and their performance on spatial tasks. Fine points out that the sample size of ten people is a small sample size, and the researchers tested for thirty-six different relationships in this sample. Fine argues that results like these should be treated with caution, because, given the sample size and the number of relationships tested, the correlation found between white matter volume and performance in the tasks could be a false positive. Fine accuses the researchers of downplaying the risk of a false positive after conducting many statistical analyses of past research projects, she argues that using their results as the basis of an explanation for why women are under-represented in scientific fields is inadequate here. Fine also discusses a 2004 neuroimaging study by neuroscientist Sandra Witelson and collaborators. This study was taken to support sex differences in emotional processing by Allan and Barbara Pease in their book Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and by Susan Pinker in her book The Sexual Paradox. Fine argues that, with a sample size of just 16, the results could easily have been false positives. She compares the study to a famous 2009 study in which, to illustrate the risk of false positives in neuroimaging research, researchers showed increased brain activity in a dead salmon during a perspective-taking task. === Dispute between Fine and Baron-Cohen === A notable dispute in 2010 between Fine and neuroscientist Simon Baron-Cohen in The Psychologist magazine centred on a study into sex differences in the responses of newborn babies to human faces and mechanical mobiles.Connellan, J., Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S. et al. (2000). Sex differences in human neonatal social perception. Infant Behavior and Development, 23, 113–118. Fine, C. (2010). From scanner to sound bite: Issues in interpreting and reporting sex differences in the brain. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19, 280–283. The research took babies under 24 hours old and showed them a human face, or a mechanical mobile. If they were shown the human face first, they were then shown the mechanical mobile and vice versa. The babies responses were recorded, and judges coded the eye movements of the babies to discern which, if either, of the stimuli the babies looked at for longer. The study concluded that female babies looked at human faces for longer, and male babies looked at mechanical mobiles for longer. Therefore, this theory derived the conclusion that female brains are programmed towards empathy whereas male brains are more inclined towards practicality and building systems. This theory suggested that an individual can be characterised into having a certain \\"brain type\\" where empathising was called the brain type E, and systemising was called the brain type S. However, some individuals can be equally strong at empathising and systemising and therefore, they possess a \\"balanced brain\\". This has the brain type B. Fine criticised the study, arguing that because the babies were shown one stimulus first and then the other, they may have become fatigued, affecting the results of the study. Furthermore, Fine also argued that the panel of judges watching the babies' eye movements may have been able to guess the sex of the baby, for example if the baby was dressed in certain clothing or had particular congratulatory cards present, giving rise to confirmation type biases. Baron-Cohen has countered these criticisms. Baron- Cohen replied to the fatigue argument by explaining that the stimuli were shown in randomised order, so as to avoid the problem of specific stimuli fatigue in either sex. In response to the claim about bias, he argued that the judges were only able to assess the babies’ eye movements by watching a video of the eye area of the baby, through which it would have been almost impossible to derive the sex of the baby. Notwithstanding this, Fine argued that the effort to conceal the babies’ sex from the experimenters in the room with the babies was “minimal”, allowing room for implicit bias, rendering the results unreliable. === Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia === Rebecca Jordan- Young provides a good case study of neurosexism in studies of those with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). Because Prenatal Hormone Theory posits early steroid hormones during fetal development as conducive to sex-typical behaviours, studies of genetic females with CAH are important to test the feasibility of this hypothesis. Jordan-Young conducts a comprehensive review of these studies, finding them to neglect four broad categories of variables that plausibly affect psychosexual development: \\"(1) physiological effects of CAH, including complex disruption of steroid hormones from early development onwards; (2) intensive medical intervention and surveillance, which many women with CAH describe as traumatic; (3) direct effects of genital morphology on sexuality; and (4) expectations of masculinisation that likely affect both the development and evaluation of gender and sexuality in CAH.\\" Complex and continuous interactions between biological factors, medical intervention, and social pressures suggest a more holistic explanation for atypicalities in the psychological make up and behaviour of those with CAH than the conventional explanation that prenatal hormones \\"masculinise\\" the brain. Neglecting these four categories in our methodology of studies into those with CAH then favours the sex difference hypothesis, providing a clear example of neurosexism in scientific research. However, studies of CAH fail to account for unusual childhood experiences, parental expectations or reporting bias. However, this is crucial because accounting for these would allow us to explain typically male behaviour. == Examples in Scientific Communication == The media reporting of the neuroscience of sex differences has also attracted criticism. A high- profile example was the reporting of a 2014 neuroimaging study on sex differences the structural connectome of the human brain. The study used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate white matter connections in the brains of 949 participants ranging from 8-22 years old. The authors claimed to have discovered \\"fundamental sex differences in the structural architecture of the human brain\\". The study was widely reported by media organizations around the world. A content analysis of the media coverage investigated the claims made in the original scientific article and in several different types of media reporting. The analysis showed that information from the scientific article was given \\"increasingly diversified, personalized, and politicized meaning\\" in media outlets and was widely seen to have vindicated traditional gender stereotypes, even though the neuroimaging technique used could only detect structural differences, not functional differences, between the sexes. === The Changing Media Environment === The way scientific information is passed from the scientific community into the public consciousness has changed with the development of technology, social media, and news platforms. The traditional route from study, to media, to public consciousness no longer permits. The advent of the \\"blogosphere\\" and other forms of social media mean that audiences now actively produce and critique scientific alongside other scientists, whether or not this is a benefit or hinderance to the scientific community is yet to be realised given the infancy of these channels. We should, however, remain alert to the problems arising from greater public involvement in our scientific communication, particularly for the understanding of findings. Cliodhna O'Connor and Helene Joffe examine how traditional media, blogs, and their comment sections autonomously project prevailing understanding of sex differences (emotion-rationality dualism and traditional role divisions) onto mute findings, construing men as purely rational and women as highly emotional, noting how both social representation theory and system justification theory may be causing bias in the interpretation of these findings. The findings of their study showed significant scope for parties to apply their own personal and cultural agendas onto the findings, and share these through blogs and comments. In projecting prevailing stereotypes on the mute findings, we have a prime example of how neurosexism can arrive in stages outside the domain of science, raising further concerns for the feminist camp for whilst we can apply the necessary checks and balances in the method of our science, once the information is in the public consciousness they can manipulate and construe research however they see fit. === Communication and Neurological discoveries === The interest and coverage generated by neurological studies on sex differences is an instance of a wider phenomenon. It is possible to see the 'neuro-' prefix being widely used: \\"neuromarketing\\", \\"neuroeconomics\\", \\"neurodrinks\\". One study documented in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience tested the hypothesis that irrelevant neuroscience explanations accompanying descriptions of psychological phenomena causes people to rate the descriptions as better quality. Results showed that irrelevant neuroscience information does indeed cause people to rate explanations more satisfying than without, even in cases where neuroscience was not useful to explain the phenomenon. == Methodological issues == According to Cordelia Fine and Gina Rippon, there are systematic methodological issues in the neuroscience of sex differences that increase the chances of neurosexism. In other words, questions of neurosexism are not entirely independent of questions about scientific methodology. ===Reverse inferences=== A reverse inference infers that activation in a particular brain region causes the presence of a mental process. Fine argues that such inferences are routine in the neuroscience of sex differences, yet \\"the absence of neat one-to-one mapping between brain regions and mental processes renders reverse inferences logically invalid\\". She emphasises that mental processes arise from complex interactions between a multiplicity of brain regions; the inference from correlation to causation is invalid, because the interactions between brain regions and mental processes are vastly complex. The invalidity stems from brain region activation being multiply realisable. For example, the mental processes of experiencing visual art and experiencing the taste of food both activate the nucleus accumbens; activation of the nucleus accumbens then doesn't necessarily cause the mental process of tasting food, since activation could be causing another mental process (e.g. experiencing visual art). ===Plasticity=== Plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change as a result of experiences in one's life. Because of the brain's plasticity, it is possible in principle for social phenomena related to gender to influence the organization of a person's brain. Fine has argued that the neuroscience of sex differences does not do enough to take plasticity into account. In Fine's view, neuroscientists tend to take a snap-shot comparison (looking at current neural differences) and describe the results as \\"hard-wired\\", without considering that the observed patterns could change over time. To examine one possible example of this, consider the 2014 Ingalhalikar et al. study, which used diffusion tensor imaging to find relatively greater within-hemisphere neural connectivity in males’ brains, and relatively greater across-hemisphere connectivity in females’ brains. This was then employed to naturalise sex-specific cognitive differences, which then naturalised their suitability for divergent skill-sets. However, given the aforementioned concept of brain plasticity, the notion that these connectivity differences are exclusively a result of natural biology can be challenged. This is because plasticity introduces the alternative possibility that individuals' sex- specific learned behaviours could have also impacted their brain connectome. Thus, the concept of brain plasticity raises the question of whether the observed brain differences from the study are caused by nature or nurture. === Sample Sizes === Fine has criticised the small sample sizes that are typical of Functional Neuroimaging (FNI) studies reporting sex differences in the brain. She supports this claim with a meta-analysis. She takes a sample of thirty-nine studies from Medline, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases, published between 2009 and 2010, in which sex differences were referred to in the article title. Fine reports that over the entire sample, the mean number of males was 19, and the mean number of females was 18.5. Disregarding the studies making sex-by-age and sex-by-group comparisons (which require larger sample sizes), the average sample sizes were even smaller, with a mean of 13.5 males, and a mean of 13.8 females. She also points out that the second largest study in the group reported a null finding. Small sample sizes are problematic because they increase the risk of False positives. Not only do false positives misinform, but they also \\"tend to persist because failures to replicate are inconclusive and unappealing both to attempt by researchers and to publish by journals\\". == Criticism == Simon Baron-Cohen has defended the neuroscience of sex differences against the charge of neurosexism. In a review of Delusions of Gender, he wrote that: > Ultimately, for me, the biggest weakness of Fine’s neurosexism allegation is > the mistaken blurring of science with politics. The mistake, according to Baron-Cohen, is how Fine ignores that: > You can be a scientist interested in the nature of sex differences while > being a clear supporter of equal opportunities and a firm opponent of all > forms of discrimination in society. According to Baron-Cohen, Fine makes multiple errors when critiquing certain experiments. For instance, in the newborn study which indicated that girls look at a human face for a longer period of time, whilst boys look at a mechanical mobile for longer, Fine argues that the stimuli used should have been presented simultaneously, rather than one at a time due to possible fatigue-effects. However, she fails to acknowledge that counter-balancing was integrated into the experimental design, in order to avoid the possibility of order-effects. Baron-Cohen holds that Fine overlooks certain details in order to fit her social constructivist theory of human gender differences, obtaining a biased outlook. Similarly, Fine attempts to find faults in certain hormone studies. For instance, she challenges whether FT (Fetal Testosterone) in the amniotic fluid does reflect FT in the brain. Baron-Cohen asserts that they would have should they had been able to measure FT in the brain in an ethical manner. Nonetheless, in FT, in the amniotic fluid is the best alternative. Again, this is overlooked by Fine. Another case for criticism considers emerging evidence from recent studies. The first study finds that some pain perception and inhibition genotypes operate differently in men's and women's brains, whereas the second reveals sex-specific patterns of brain cell death during strokes. An important consequence of these results is that such physiological variations between the sexes serve as a basis to justify emerging research into sex-specific treatment methods to cure illnesses such as stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Huntington's Disease in a targeted, improved fashion. The risks of falsely rejecting a potentially valid hypothesis (false negative) of the existence of innate brain sex differences may, in this case, raise serious ethical concerns. This is because the potential to save several more lives with sex-specific treatment may be overlooked if we falsely label all investigations in this area as being neurosexist by nature. === The extreme male brain theory of autism === A further reason to take the hypothesis of sex differences in neural structure seriously is that it may shed light on the phenomenon of autism, according to Baron Cohen. He founds his 'Extreme male brain theory' of autism on the idea that there are some traits recurring more often in male brains and some that are more common in female brains (potentially a result of exposure to high levels of foetal testosterone). According to this theory, if we dub 'male' brain one which performs better on systematising tasks than on empathising, and we define 'female' brain the opposite profile, we can then say that \\"autism can be considered as an extreme of the normal male profile.\\" As 'hyper-systemisers', those with ASD find interest in non-human, rule-based systems. A common trait for autistic individuals is the development of obsessive interests, which can manifest across all levels of functioning. For example, someone with ASD who possesses a lower IQ may become fixated on the collection and organization of objects, whereas those with a higher IQ may form obsessive interest in railway systems or anatomy, for example. This focus upon rigidity governing such interests reflects the hypothesis that the more 'flexible' demands such as reading social cues and empathizing are much more difficult for individuals with ASD. There are interesting implications that follow from this regarding the 'enhancement' of pro-social behaviour in individuals with ASD. Particularly, preliminary studies show how oxytocin nasal spray could improve both social communication and interaction: Baron- Cohen's theory was hinted at originally by Hans Asperger in 1944.‘The autistic personality is an extreme variant of male intelligence. Even within the normal variation, we find typical sex differences in intelligence… In the autistic individual, the male pattern is exaggerated to the extreme’ The extreme male brain theory of autism has many critics, however, who are sceptical of the evidence the theory is based on and its central claims. David Skuse, chair of behavioral and brain sciences at University College London, for example, takes issue with the idea that people with autism lack empathy. He instead claims that people with autism can feel others' pain, but they are slower to process this emotion. Thomas Frazier, director of the Center for Autism at the Cleveland Clinic, makes the point that the relationship between gender and autism is complex and that needs to be taken into account more by those proposing the extreme male theory. He claims that researchers do not account for social conditioning enough and that effects, assosciated with gender, are driven less by innate biological differences and more by cues from parents and siblings about what it means to be a man or a woman. People with autism may, however, ignore those cues more than those without it. == References == ==External links== *Cordelia Fine, \\"Delusions of Gender\\", the book's official site Category:Neuroscience Category:Sexism Category:Gender Category:Gender- related stereotypes ","title":"Neurosexism"},{"id":"60271118","text":"Adventurer's Park is a small amusement park in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in New York City.

It is based on the novel of the same name by A. B. Yehoshua. Bat-Adam also starred in the film, alongside Yehoram Gaon, and wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Tzvika Kertzner. == Background and production == When the novel The Lover (by A. B. Yehoshua) came out in 1977, it was an unprecedented bestseller, and the talk of social salons and the media alike. It powerfully described the loneliness of its characters, as well as all the forbidden relationships between them: Between a married woman and her lover, between the married father and his daughter's friend, and between a Jewish girl and her Arab love interest. When it was announced that the book would be developed into a film, all the major producers, actors, directors and screenwriters in Israel wanted to be involved. However, production company owner Menahem Golan was busy setting up his new American production company, and the project kept running into problems and personnel changes. At the start, Golan approved his house- director, Boaz Davidson's request to direct, with the understanding that he would finish up his current obligations, then work on The Lover. But two years later, he was still delaying the project due to his workload. Golan set out to find a new director, and was faced with a difficult choice. Yehoshua wanted Oded Kotler to direct, but Kotler had never directed a feature before. Another potential director was Dan Wolman, who had experience with adaptations, and several other directors. But Golan also kept putting off the decision. About 15 months before the film was eventually released, Golan saw the film \\"Atalia\\", starring Michal Bat-Adam, and knew he had found his Asia. Bat-Adam agreed to act in the film only if she could also direct it, and Golan agreed immediately. Within a few months the adapted screenplay was completed, and casting began. Bat-Adam wanted actor Yossi Pollack for the role of Adam, and his selection was even announced in the press, but Golan was adamant that Yehoram Gaon - better known as a singer - was the only possible choice. Golan, it seems, owed a debt of gratitude to Gaon, who had advised him to by the movie rights for The Lover. Golan did admire Gaon's acting, nevertheless, especially in his 1976 film \\"Kazablan\\". The widely admired acting teacher Fanny Lubitsch was cast as the \\"all-seeing\\" grandmother, and the rest of the cast joined soon thereafter. But personnel issues continued right up to the start of filming, when the cinematographer David Gurfinkel was brought in at the very last moment. Bat-Adam insisted on rehearsals before the filming began, much like a theater production. The actors expressed surprise, but in the end were pleased with the process. Filming took place mostly in Haifa, and also in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The filming took 8 weeks. The film was cut in two versions - one in Hebrew, and one in English.תיק העיתונות לסרט \\"המאהב\\", גולן גלובוס קנון ישראל, 1986 == Plot summary == Adam (Yehoram Gaon) and Asia (Michal Bat-Adam) are a married couple, who no longer have sex. (The reason for this is not revealed in the film, though it is in the novel.) Asia, who is studying for her PhD, faces difficulty with some of the material, which is in Spanish. Adam, a car repair shop owner, asks a customer, Gavriel (Roberto Pollack) to be her translator in lieu of payment for fixing his car. Gavriel is an Israeli who lives in Argentina, and is visiting in Israel to deal with his dying grandmother's estate. Not realizing how expensive the repairs would be to his grandmother's vintage car, he agrees. After a short time working with Asia, everyone, including Asia and Adam's daughter Daphna (\\"Dafi\\"), realize that the two have become lovers. The year is 1973, and the Yom Kippur War breaks out. Adam pressures Gavriel to enlist, and he disappears, along with his iconic car. The war ends, prisoners are exchanged, and there is still no sign of Gavriel. Adam asks his young Arab worker, Naim, for help – and the two break into the grandmother's apartment, to try and find clues to Gavriel's whereabouts. They discover that the grandmother's health has improved. The grandmother advises Adam to seek Gavriel at night, not in the day. He begins to work with Naim towing cars from accidents. Dafi joins them, gradually dropping out of school, and growing closer to Naim. Around this time, Dafi's schoolmate Tali sets her sights on Adam – she corners him, undresses in front of him, and in spite of his protestations, touches him. They end up having sex, which Adam then says was a mistake and a moment of weakness. One night, Adam finds a piece of metal from the car Gavriel is driving at the site of a hit and run accident. The driver of the car that was hit says the other car had Haredim (ultra-orthodox Jews, recognizable by their anachronistic 17th century black clothing) in it, and sped off towards Jerusalem. Adam goes to a Haredi neighborhood in Jerusalem, Mea Shearim, and finds Gavriel. Gavriel tells him that he was drafted to fight at the front in the war, and escaped with the help of a Haredi group who came to cheer up the troops. At this same time, Gavriel's grandmother passes away, and Asia tells him he should leave and never come back. When the three of them return to the family home, they find Dafi and Naim after getting dressed, after having sex. Adam drives Naim back to his village and fires him. But before leaving, hands him a package filled with money, so that he can go back to school. Naim refuses to take it. He returns home, and Asia tells him about her separation from Gavriel. == Cast == * Asia – Michal Bat-Adam * Adam – Yehoram Gaon * Gavriel – Roberto Pollack * Gavriel's grandmother – Fanny Lubitsch * Daphna (Dafi) – Avigail Ariely * Naim – Awas Khatib * Tali – Noa Aizik == Reception == The film created a media scandal in Israel when it was released, due to the perception that it presents marital infidelity as a positive thing. Bat-Adam described this as \\"a lynching\\", which pushed her to the brink of giving up filmmaking. However, the movie was a theatrical success, and 23 films later, Bat-Adam is known as \\"the queen of Israeli cinema\\". In her review in Haaretz, Rachel Gordin wrote that \\"the film manages to touch on very real points of the viewers' emotions\\" thanks to the character of Naim as portrayed by Awas Khatib, but that \\"it otherwise never really extends beyond the realm of melodrama.\\" Irit Shamgar, in Ha'ir, celebrated the fact that The Lover \\"beat the censorship\\" and was approved for screening, while her colleague Danny Wurt said in his review that the portrayal of the main characters left him unimpressed, though he found the secondary characters of Naim and the grandmother to be more alive and humorous. Yedioth reviewer Nachman Einberger panned the film, claiming it had \\"not one moment of grace\\", while A. B. Yehoshua, the author of the novel the film is based upon, expressed his satisfaction with the translation of his work to film. Yael Israel, reviewer for \\"Al Hamishmar\\", gave the film a positive review, calling it \\"an easy-to-digest and realistic adaptation\\". == References == == External links == * * Category:Films about the Israel Defense Forces Category:Israeli films Category:Hebrew-language films Category:Films directed by Michal Bat-Adam Category:1986 films Category:Films set in Jerusalem Category:Films set in Haifa ","title":"The Lover (1986 film)"},{"id":"60271204","text":"Stan Callaghan (1916-1989) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s and 1940s.

The theory of sanitation syndrome was first advanced by Maynard Swanson in his frequently-cited 1977 paper, \\"The Sanitation Syndrome: Bubonic Plague and Urban Native Policy in the Cape Colony, 1900-1909.\\" In his paper, Swanson argued that in apartheid-era South Africa, powerful White South Africans used medical terms in an attempt to justify segregation. He also asserted that his theory may be applicable to situations outside of his study, and it has since been applied to numerous other instances of segregation. == Background == English administrators of South African cities had long expressed their racially-tinged concerns about the cleanliness of majority nonwhite neighborhoods. In the year 1900, the bubonic plague arrived in several South African port cities, prompting drastic, racially-motivated responses from administrators. For example, the Plague Administration of Cape Town relocated over six thousand Black and Coloured South Africans from their homes within the city into hastily-constructed shelters near a \\"sewage farm\\" in 1901. During that time, there were slightly more cases of bubonic plague among whites than black Africans in Cape Town. The effect of this separation, as well as similar policies across major South African cities, was the highly- segregated urban landscape of South African cities in the twentieth century. == Swanson's Theory == Swanson argued that white South Africans associated the bubonic plague with black Africans because of sanitation syndrome. \\"Sanitizing\\" a neighborhood did not mean improving hygiene, living conditions, and access to medical care. Instead, it meant removing non-white residents from the neighborhood altogether. As a result, administrators were able to fully segregate entire cities. The theory of sanitation syndrome implicated urban whites in creating segregated cities in South Africa, as many of the people causing and complicit with the forced relocations were members of the urban middle and upper classes. It argued that scientific language could be used to justify socially-motivated policies, despite scientific evidence indicating that those policies would not be effective, and how scientific investigation could be directed along political and social goals. This theory has been applied numerous times, such as in Patterson and Packard's White Plague, Black Labor and B. Freund's The African City: A History. The paper has been cited 589 times, according to Google Scholar. == Criticisms == Historians such as Marc Epprecht have criticized the theory of sanitation syndrome as veering towards oversimplification. Specifically, Epprecht criticized how Swanson fails to examine Africans' attitudes towards, and possible participation in, sanitation syndrome. Despite this, authors continue to see \\"sanitation syndrome\\" as a useful and accurate way of thinking about segregation. == References == Swanson, M. (1977).

Map of railways in Watford, showing the old and new Watford stations By 1839, the station is recorded in the Bucks Herald as having a corrugated iron roof, an engine shed and stationary pumping house with a tall chimney, and a footbridge. In its 21 years of operation it also served as a station for royalty; in the short period when the Dowager Queen Adelaide was resident at Cassiobury House (–1849), this station was remodelled to provide her with a royal waiting room, and it was also reportedly used by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on a trip to visit Sir Robert Peel in November 1843, when they travelled by road from Windsor Castle to take a train from Watford to . From 1846, the L&BR; was absorbed into the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The old Watford station closed when it was replaced by the larger Watford Junction station, which opened on 5 May 1858. The new station was located south of St Albans Road in order to accommodate the newly constructed branch line to St Albans and later, the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway and the Watford DC Line. The junction station was rebuilt in 1909, and was extensively redeveloped in the 1980s. ==The building today== The Grade-II-listed Old Station House still stands at 147A St Albans Road, a rare surviving example of architecture from the beginning of the railway age. It is one of two surviving intermediate station buildings in Britain from the early railways, the other being the original station building, built by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway in 1837. Until 2018, the building was occupied by a second-hand car dealership. It currently stands in the middle of a new property development and plans have been announced to convert the building into a craft beer tap room. ==See also== *Watford station – a list of stations past and present ==References== ===Notes=== ==External links== * Category:Disused railway stations in Watford Category:Former London and Birmingham Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1837 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1858 Category:1837 establishments in England Category:1858 disestablishments in England Category:Grade II listed buildings in Hertfordshire Category:History of Watford ","title":"Watford railway station (1837-1858)"},{"id":"60271384","text":"Edgar George Papworth Snr (20/21 August 1809 – 26 September 1866) was an English sculptor. He studied at the Royal Academy of Arts where he later exhibited works; he created sculptures of classical themes, and of notable people of the day. ==Life== Design for a Candelabrum, circa 1826–37, by Edgar George Papworth Snr He was born on 20 or 21 August 1809, the only son of Thomas Papworth (1773–1814), \\"builder, plasterer, and architect\\", who conducted the last stucco and plastering works carried on in London on a large scale. These works were founded by Thomas's father, John Papworth (1750–1799), and were situated in Great Portland Street and Newman Street. John Papworth was \\"master-plaisterer\\" at St James's Palace and Kensington Palace from 1780, and executed much stucco and plastering at the palaces, at Somerset House, and at Greenwich Hospital Chapel. Edgar early exhibited talents for drawing, modelling, and design in sculpture, and at an early age was placed as a pupil with Edward Hodges Baily. He was living at the time at the house of his uncle, the architect John Buonarotti Papworth. He was entered, on 15 December 1826, at the age of seventeen, as a student of the Royal Academy of Arts; in December 1829 he obtained the silver medal for a model from the antique; in December 1831 another silver medal for a figure; December 1833 the gold medal for a group of Leucothea presenting the scarf to Ulysses; and in 1834 he received a travelling scholarship of the academy. In 1836 he sent from Rome a Psyche. He returned home in 1837 in ill-health, but exhibited in 1838 a head of Flora, and another of Psyche. While in Rome he made sketches for a panorama of that city; these he enlarged, and exhibited about 1844 for a short time in a gallery in Great Portland Street. He etched Original Sculptural Designs, which he had executed in Rome, and published them in folio in 1840. John Bunyan's tomb, in Bunhill Fields, London Meanwhile he continued to exhibit, chiefly busts, statuettes, and sketch designs, sent from his studio in Seymour Street, St Pancras. The most popular of his ideal works were \\"Adam and Eve\\", executed for Mr Foster-White, treasurer to St Bartholomew's Hospital; \\"The Woman of Samaria\\", for Mr James Brand; and (1856) \\"The Moabitish Maiden\\", a commission from Albert, the Prince Consort. Among the numerous busts of eminent men he executed those of John Hanning Speke, of Sir Richard Burton, and of Admiral Robert Blake, erected in the shire hall in Taunton. John Bunyan's memorial tomb (1862) in Bunhill Fields, London, was also his work. In the competition of June and July 1857 for the Wellington monument for St Paul's Cathedral his model received the third prize of £300, out of eighty- three designs submitted; that by Alfred Stevens (the design eventually installed) was one of the five receiving £100 each. He exhibited sculptures at the Royal Academy from 1832 to 1866. His works were drawn from historical, literary and genre themes; most are now lost, and are known from titles and illustrations. Titles include \\"The Bird's Nester\\" (1857), \\"An Incident in the Siege of Lucknow\\" (1858), and in 1859 \\"The Young Emigrant\\" and \\"The Bride\\". In his later years his circumstances were embarrassed owing to his extravagant and careless habits. He died on 26 September 1866 at his home in Dorset Square, aged 65, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. ==Personal life== In 1831, Papworth married Caroline Baily, daughter of his first master; she died in 1867.

He was a co-founder of the German Society for Mammalogy and has been considered one of the founders of conservation in Purssia. The Nazi government arrested him for having Jewish ancestry and he died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Wolf was born in 1871 in Dresden. He was baptized Protestant but came from a well-known Jewish physician family of Dr Richard Wolf. He was tutored at home and sent to Switzerland in 1881 to learn French. He went to a boarding school in Weinheim in 1883 and then at Wiesbaden and Dresden. He studied law at Freiburg, Munich and Berlin and earned a doctorate from the University of Leipzig in 1895. After work as a legal clerk, he became a judge at Elberfeld and became a District Judge at Berlin- Charlottenburg in 1912. He was involved in amending conservation laws and in strengthening laws to protect wilderness. He was involved in the creation of the first Prussian Nature Conservation Act of 1920. He worked with the Brandenburg Commission for Nature Preservation but he was removed from all position in 1933 due to his Jewish ancestry.Memorial plaque in Berlin. Location: Wolf was also a keen mountaineer and speleologist and was a member of the Hauptverband Deutscher Höhlenforscher (Association of German Speleologists), serving as its founding president. Wolf began to maintain a database of all the world's caves and for this he had amassed numerous books and documents in his library. After being removed from work, he was aided by Julius Riemer to continue to serve as an editor of the speleologists newsletter, \\"Mitteilungen über Höhlen- und Karstforschung.\\" The Nazi research wing, the SS Ahnenerbe, became interested in caves as potential bomb shelters and on July 6, 1942, they arrested Wolf and deported him to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. He died on January 6, 1943. Recent research suggests that Riemer had been asked by the Gestapo to keep in touch with Benno Wolf to prevent the latter from destroying his database of caves.Kowa, Günter (7-June-2019) Focus Online.

She worked in the fields of domestic violence, child abuse and rape, with the aim of understanding extreme forms of violence in order to develop prevention strategies. == Biography == Cavanagh was born in the Gorbals area of Glasgow to Adeline Martin MacGill, a seamstress, and John Cavanagh, a spirit salesman. She attended Holyrood Secondary School in Glasgow and later studied business at Glasgow College of Commerce and Distribution. She studied at the University of Stirling graduating with a BA in sociology (1975) and an MSc (1978). While employed as a social worker in England, Cavanagh was graduated with a second Master's degree in social work, from the University of Warwick. In 1998 she received a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Manchester in 1998. Cavanagh and her partner Graeme Forbes had two children. In 2008, after a two-year illness, she died from ovarian cancer. == Career == In the 1970s Cavanagh worked as a research assistant, alongside fellow student Monica Wilson, with Rebecca and Russell Dobash on the first study in Britain of violence against women. They examined 12,000 police records and interviewed over 100 women in an attempt to understand the plight of abused women and their children, and responses of the justice system. She used the findings for her MSc thesis, Battered women and social control (1978). Cavanagh began working as a social worker at Leicestershire County Council in 1978 and continued to work in the field of social work throughout the first half of the 1980s. She was appointed guardian ad litem (in litigation) for Derbyshire, where she helped establish a voluntary hostel for women with housing needs, and became the authority's first research social worker. In 1996 she co-edited Working with men: feminism and social work with Viviene E. Cree, a collection of essays exploring gender- blindness in social work policy and literature. In 1986 Cavanagh moved from England to Edinburgh. She later took on a position at the University of Stirling as a part-time lecturer in social work where she played a central role in a large research project on violence, a research evaluation of the first programmes for domestic violence abusers in the United Kingdom. In 1989 Cavanagh and Ruth Lewis were appointed research fellows on Dobashes' project 'Evaluating abuser programmes', which examined court records and interviewed men convicted of violent abuse and their female partners. The same research team examined murder cases in Britain, work which Cavanagh then drew on for her PhD thesis. She was a co-grant holder in the study of Murder in Britain and had sole responsibility for all data from Scotland in this national study. They published their findings in Changing violent men (2000). Cavanagh worked as a lecturer in social work at the University of Glasgow (1993-2004), and as a senior lecturer in social work at the University of Stirling (2004-2008). Beyond her formal roles in academia, Cavanagh worked to raise public awareness, change public policies and practices, and introduce innovations for abused women and their children, and for victims of rape. == References == Category:1951 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Stirling Category:Alumni of the University of Warwick Category:Women social workers Category:Social work scholars Category:People from Gorbals Category:Academics of the University of Glasgow Category:Academics of the University of Stirling Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:Scottish women activists Category:Scottish women academics ","title":"Kate Cavanagh"},{"id":"60271696","text":"Brady catamarans are twin-hulled boats that are designed by Peter Brady of Brisbane, Australia.

This current structure replaced a former building that housed the Empire State Bank. After a fire destroyed the site in 1896, B. Lichtenstein, who owned the property since 1886, commissioned German architects Delemos & Cordes to redevelop the lot. Known for their Renaissance Revival and Classical Revival style, Delemos & Cordes contributed a number of properties to the Ladies Historic District, most notably the Siegel-Cooper Department Store (1896-1898) and Adams Dry Good Store (1902). The team is also responsible for the design of Macy's Herald Square, a landmarked retail space in Midtown Manhattan. ==Architecture== 640 Broadway demonstrates Delemos & Cordes' competency for Neoclassic design. The Broadway facade shows a two- story base with second-story comer show windows, a limestone entrance leading to the upper floors with oval transom, a denticulated hood and paired, grouped and arched fenestration across the upper stories. Classical ornamentation, including cartouches, triglyphs, keystones, molded architraves and foliated capitals ornament the facade. The Bleecker Street facade shows the same two- story brick base, recessed fenestration, a historic wood sash and end bay at the west, similar to the Broadway facade. This side features brick piers with stylized terra-cotta capitals, a decorative wrought-iron fire escape and a bracketed galvanized iron cornice. The Crosby Street side offers cast-iron columns supporting decorative lintels at ground level, with concrete block infill and metal doors. ==History== 640 Broadway was called the Empire State Bank Building in honor of the property's former tenant. The Lichtenstein family held the property until at least 1909, and it remained a mixed use site until 1976. In 1943, owners filed a document with the Department of Buildings indicating that the site housed towel, window cleaner, millinery, gloves, and shoe manufacturers. By 1965, a barber shop occupied the ground floor and the upper stories were used by a dress, buttons and badges manufacturer, and a cloth cutter. A decade later, an offset press, food and vitamin distributor, importer and interior design firm rented space at the site. In 2007, the upper stories were converted to living-working quarters of 2-3 apartments per floor. Winhaven Group purchased the property in 2012 for $32.5 million. Today, the main ground level is occupied by Swatch and the upper stories offer luxury residential units. == References == Category:1890s architecture Category:1897 establishments in New York (state) Category:Neoclassical architecture in New York City 640 Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1897 Category:Commercial buildings in Manhattan Category:Residential buildings completed in 1897 Category:Residential buildings in Manhattan ","title":"640 Broadway"},{"id":"60271860","text":"Joel Huertas Cornudella (born 9 May 1995) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Polish club Wigry Suwałki as a midfielder. ==Club career== Born in Juneda, Lleida, Catalonia, Huertas joined La Masia in summer 2011, from Lleida Esportiu.

He was born in Gandaf in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent and eventually ended up settling in Sehwan Sharif, Sindh. He was spiritual successor of the famous Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, in Sehwan Sharif. Nadir Ali Shah's legacy rests primarily on his having been one of the most notable figures among saints of Qalandariyya Sufi Order with regard to the Islamic preaching, mysticism and asceticism. Additionally he is believed to have contributed significantly to the promotion of human welfare as an essential part of the Qalandariyya Sufi Order of Islam. He was also custodian of the shrine of the Sufi saint Abdullah Shah Ghazi in Karachi. == Early life == He was born in Village Gandaf, District Swabi in 1897 to a Pashtun Syed family. He received his early education from his father Ghulam Shah. == Finding his Murshid == In his early youth, he with the permission of his parents, embarked on the journey of finding his Murshid (spiritual guide). He stayed in different cities of the then Indian subcontinent, of which Lahore, Sirhind Sharif, Delhi, Ajmer and Quetta are worth mentioning. He spent time in the company of many saints and was blessed with their attention and training. At last he saw a dream in which he was instructed by Lal Shahbaz Qalandarhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Shahbaz_Qalandar to come to Sehwan Sharif. It was in the dervish lodge, near the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan Sharif, that he met his Murshid (spiritual mentor), who he was searching for and who was to have the greatest influence on his life, Deedar Ali Shah. Murshid Deedar Ali Shah, who was the then successor of the Qalandariyya Sufi Order and custodian of the Sufi centre named Kafi Sakhi Sarwar, became his spiritual teacher, and later on appointed him as his successor. After Deedar Ali Shah's death in 1931, Nadir Ali Shah became the custodian, taking the name of Murshid Nadir Ali Shah. == Self-restraint == Inspired by love for The Divine, he lived an extremely ascetic life. He gave up solid food altogether, early in his life. In 1946 Indian mystic Meher Baba went Sehwan Sharif to meet him. He called him \\"an advanced pilgrim\\". According to him Nadir Ali Shah stood in a ditch for a period of two years. He would take only liquid food. He would wear faqirs' clothes and a Qalandari cap (a cotton cap with flaps over the ears). Nadir Ali Shah kept fasting for fifty consecutive years. During all these years, he fasted all the day and prayed all the night. He would hold his both hands joined together, with palms upward, for hours at night, the way Muslims make dua or supplication to God. == As a Spiritual Master == Nadir Ali Shah was the most distinguished disciple of Murshid Deedar Ali Shah, who belonged to the Qalandariyya Sufi Order of Islam, established by Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. Deedar Ali Shah was custodian of Kafi Sakhi Sarwar in Sehwan Sharif. After Deedar Ali Shah's death in 1931, Nadir Ali Shah became the Murshid (spiritual leader) of this Sufi Order. He held this position for 43 years until his death in 1974. As a Murshid, he inspired a large number of people to reform their lives and many of them gained eminence for their devotion to God and service to humanity, which included feeding the poor and hungry. Like his predecessors Murshid Nadir Ali Shah was called as Ruler or Governor of The Brotherhood. He was succeeded after his death by Murshid Arif Ali Shah in 1974. British author and Literature Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul, during his travel to Pakistan in 1979, visited the Sufi Centre of Nadir Ali Shah in Sehwan Sharif and recognised the community of his disciples as a group of friendly, delighted people with brightness in their eyes, who \\"knew they served the poor and God\\". They had chosen a \\"life of sacrifice and service\\". Many of his disciples attained spiritual height. Nadir Ali Shah was also custodian of the shrine of the two grandsons of Abdul Qadir Gilani. The shrine of Muhammad ibn Abdul Razzaq Gilani and Ahmed ibn Abdul Razzaq Gilani is located in the west of the Sehwan city, also called as Pir Pota Mazar or Dargah Masoom Pak. Thousands of people participate in their Urs or annual death anniversary, which is celebrated every year on 10th of Rabi' al-Thani. Nadir Ali Shah was also custodian of the shrine of the Sufi saint Abdullah Shah Ghazi, located in Karachi. The Shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi was built, expanded and beautified during his era in 1950s. He built a Mosque, a Langar Khana, a Qawwali Hall and a Guest House in its premises as well as the lengthy stairway leading up to the shrine, which is situated on the top of a sandy hill. A devotional connection has always been observed between the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi in Karachi and the Nadir Ali Shah's dervish lodge, Kafi Sakhi Sarwar in Sehwan Sharif. == The Dervish Lodge == (Location Located just a short walk from the Qalandar's shrine in Sehwan Sharif, it is an ancient spiritual institution and abode for the dervishes of the Qalandariyya Sufi Order of Islam. It is commonly called as Kafi. Etymology Kafi is referred to a Khanqah or a teaching and dwelling place for the Qalandari dervishes. Other names of this dervish lodge are Kafi of Murshid Nadir Ali Shah and Kafi Sakhi Sarwar (due to the vicinal worship place of Sultan Sakhi Sarwar). History The Kafi is as old as the era of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. The custodian of Kafi is called Murshid (spiritual guide) and the disciples are called malangs (dervishes) and sawalis (aspirants). The Murshid traces his spiritual descent from Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. The malangs are well organised and devoted to their cause. As of 1980s, their number was over two hundred and fifty, some of whom were in the service of the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi and some of the other shrines as well. Among them are highly educated and well-to-do people, who have chosen a \\"life of sacrifice and service\\". Hundreds of thousands of followers are also affiliated with the Kafi across the globe. The shrines of the nine Murshids who have passed away so far are inside the Kafi. They were held in high regard for their services and hence \\"became rulers or governors of the brotherhood\\". The last Murshid was Nadir Ali Shah, who died at the age of seventy-seven. The current incumbent is Murshid Arif Ali Shah, a highly educated and certified MBBS doctor. He was the most distinguished disciple of Nadir Ali Shah, so the throne and the crown were handed over to him shortly after the death of his predecessor. Teachings The Qalandari Tariqa or Sufi order proposes struggle with the self, purification of the heart and feeding of the soul. This is accomplished with prayers and remembrance, along with Khidmat (service to humanity). Services The Kafi works as a spiritual institution, where spiritual education and training of Qalandar's devotees has been going on for the last more than seven hundred years. For centuries, the dervish lodge had the honor of the Caretaking of the Sacred Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, which also included keeping the shrine in good repair. It had also the privilege of supplying free food and water to the pilgrims and visitors who came to Sehwan Sharif. After Murshid Deedar Ali Shah's death in 1931, his spiritual successor, Murshid Nadir Ali Shah assumed the charge of the Kafi, as well as the privilege and right of the repair of the sacred Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and the provision of food and water to the pilgrims. He held this prestigious office for forty three years. He was known for his generosity and hospitality. He worked throughout his life for the alleviation of hunger and remarkably expanded the Free Food and Water Program, first to all the poor population of the town and its suburbs and then to the other cities, including Karachi and Quetta. The Kafi started serving a nutritional meal twice a day to thousands of people daily. Among the daily routine work of the dervishes, besides observing prayers and the all-night remembrance of God, was the hard work and toil with which they managed the Kafi and arranged the food and water for the pilgrims and the poor population of the town and its suburbs. According to Ali Ahmed Brohi, a notable writer and scholar, this service continued throughout the year. According to him, in the deadly heat of Sehwan, kneading thirty maunds (1200 kilograms) of flour and feeding bread to large number of people daily was such a difficult task, which could only be managed by Qalandar's devoted malangs, no one else had this opportunity. Provision of water was no easy task at that time, as it involved drawing water from the river Indus, a few miles away from the centre of the town, filling it in large leather bags, loading it onto bullocks, trekking it back, through some of the hottest weathers in the world, and then to fill the leather cisterns and earthenware vessels in the sacred Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and the Dervish Lodge. Nadir Ali Shah also built a pilgrim hostel for the travellers. He was honoured and held in high esteem by his people and his popularity outstripped that of his predecessors. To the north of Dervish Lodge is Kafi Sakhi Sarwar, named after Sultan Sakhi Sarwar who worshipped here for forty days and prayed in The Divine Court for a permanent Langar (free food facility), which was accepted and the Langar continued here forever. Once a well-wisher advised Murshid Nadir Ali Shah that wheat was going to be expensive and it would be difficult to get even fifty rupees a maund, so it should be arranged in advance. Murshid smiled and told him that \\"this Langar is running in the name of Allah and He is also responsible for the provision. Even if a grain of wheat is found at the price of fifty rupees, the Langar will continue till the Day of Judgment\\". == Teachings and Impact == Being a Murshid of the Qalandariyya Sufi Order of Islam, Nadir Ali Shah emphasized on devotion to God, seeking of knowledge, tawakkul, sabr, purity, humility, brotherhood, forgiveness and Khidmat (service to humanity). His teachings influenced large number of people across the world. == Philanthropy == Murshid Nadir Ali Shah remarkably expanded the volunteer work of his dervish lodge. In 1930s, he laid the foundation of a volunteer organisation for the alleviation of hunger and malnutrition. For this purpose, he started a Langar khana (Free Meal Service Program) in Sehwan Sharif, for the pilgrims as well as the general public. In addition to fighting malnutrition and hunger, the programme was also intended to combat age, gender and socioeconomic inequalities in access to food. This Langar khana continued to serve free food to thousands of men, women and children daily, irrespective of their age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and belief. He also expanded the Free Meal Service Program to the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi in Karachi. == Herbal Medicine == Nadir Ali Shah was an expert physician in Herbal Medicine. People from far away places would come and seek treatment from him. == Spiritual Lineage == As with any other major Sufi order, the Qalandariyya proposes a Silsila (an unbroken spiritual chain) of transmitted knowledge, going back to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad through one of his companions, which in the Qalandariyya case is Ali (d. 661). Thus Nadir Ali Shah's spiritual lineage is traditionally given as follow: # Murshid Nadir Ali Shah (d. 1974), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Deedar Ali Shah (d. 1931), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Shamsher Ali Shah (d.1926), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Qutub Ali Shah (d. 1914), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Mehboob Ali Shah (d. 1900), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Khaki Shah (d. 1869), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Aman Ali Shah (d. 1853), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Darbar Ali Shah (d. 1841), \\"taught by\\" # Murshid Roshan Ali Shah (d. 1826). This uninterrupted chain is traced back to Prophet Muhammad via Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and Ali. == Death and Burial == Nadir Ali Shah died in the early hours of Tuesday, 8 October 1974 (21st Ramadan 1394 AH) at the age of 77 years. His funeral prayer was held in the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and was attended by large number of people. The funeral prayer was led by Qazi Muhammad Murad. He was laid to rest alongside his spiritual mentor Murshid Deedar Ali Shah in Sehwan Sharif. == Legacy == Murshid Nadir Ali Shah was succeeded after his death by Murshid Arif Ali Shah in 1974. He left behind hundreds of thousands of followers in Pakistan and across the world, who are known for their devotion to God and service to humanity. The Langar khana (Free food facility) of Nadir Ali Shah is located in the dervish lodge of Nadir Ali Shah, also called Kafi in Sehwan Sharif. This charity center provides meal to thousands of men, women and children daily and virtually feeds the entire poor population of the town as well as the travelers. Dozens of Malangs (devotees) participate in preparing and distributing the food on regular basis. Several free drinking water Sebils have been set up in Sehwan Sharif by the devotees of Nadir Ali Shah, where cold water is freely dispensed to thousands of people daily. Apart from this, the centre also provides free accommodation to the travellers in the travellers' lodge. == In Poetry and Prose == Famous poets of Pakistan, in different periods, have paid homage and expressed their love to Murshid Nadir Ali Shah by writing and saying numerous Qasidas (panegyrics) and Manqabats (devotional poems) in national and regional languages such as Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Balochi and Pashto. Noor Jehan, Shaukat Ali, Ahmed Khan, Khyal Muhammad are among the singers who have commemorated and paid tribute to him in their Qawwalis. EMI Pakistan released an album of devotional songs in his remembrance, titled \\"Qawwali Hazrat Syed Nadir Ali Shah\\" on his 40th death anniversary. == Shrine == The Dargah (shrine) of Nadir Ali Shah is located in the dervish lodge of Nadir Ali Shah which is situated in southeast of the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. The iconic white and green dome is made of ceramic tiles. The hemispherical dome rests on the square building, the corners of which are decorated with four minarets, made of mosaic ceramic tilework resembling traditional patchwork of ralli. The walls of the shrine are also covered from outside by the same mosaic tilework, making horizontal lines of white, red, green, yellow, blue and black ceramic tiles, from top to bottom, giving an expression of pure delight. On the interior delicate glasswork adorns the lofty ceiling and the dome. The walls are decorated from inside with the turquoise ceramic tiles and delicate glass work. Quranic verses have been carved in the glasswork on the northern wall. Large number of people visit the shrine daily and pay tribute to Nadir Ali Shah. Before his death in 1974, Nadir Ali Shah appointed his disciple and nephew Dr Syed Muhammad Arif Shah as his successor. == References == Category:Sindhi Sufi saints Category:Sufism in Pakistan Category:1897 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Sufism in Asia ","title":"Nadir Ali Shah"},{"id":"60271956","text":"The ION CubeSat Carrier is a free flying CubeSat deployer and technology demonstrator, developed by Italian company D-Orbit.

Panas did her education in northern Italian cities before she worked as a teacher. It was not until a short while following her teaching career that she decided to become a nun and so entered a convent in secret after her parents and priest uncle exhibited opposition to her desire. In the convent she served as novice mistress and served as an abbess on two separate occasions and was even elected to a prominent religious council despite her several severe illnesses during the late 1950s. The beatification process for Panas launched in 1983 in the Fabriano-Matelica diocese and she became titled as a Servant of God. The cause gained greater traction on 10 October 2016 after Pope Francis signed a decree that recognized her heroic virtue and named her as Venerable. ==Life== Agnese Pacifica Panas was born on 15 January 1896 in Alano di Piave in the Belluno province to Antonio Benvenuto Panas and Maria Biasotto as the fourth of six children. Panas had three sisters preceding her: Clelia and then both Angelina and Adele who died in their infancies. In her own childhood she fell ill which caused her mother distress since she still was mourning the loss of Angelina and Adele; her mother entrusted her to the intercession of the Madonna di Monte Berico (venerated in the north) and Panas managed to recover. Her artisan parents lost their jobs due to the industrialization in the region and so were forced to emigrate to the United States of America in 1902. Panas was left in the care of her paternal priest uncle Angelo who was a chaplain in Asiago and later the archpriest for Enego and who was living with his nurse sister Maria. Her schooling began under the Canossians in Feltre and later continued in Vicenza and on 5 August 1906 she made her First Communion. Panas remained in her uncle's care (receiving her initial education and religious formation from him) until her parents returned in 1910. Her parents returned with two new children Maximina and Rosa who had been born in the United States. In 1910 she moved to the Saint Alvise college in Venice and also attended the Nicolò Tommaseo Institute there before she graduated in 1913. It was following her graduation that she began teaching in the Conetta neighborhood of Cona close to Venice and it was there in 1914 that she met Father Luigi Fritz who would begin serving as her confidante and spiritual director until the end of their lives (which occurred within weeks of each other). It was also around this stage that Panas began keeping a journal and made the resolution that she would never write unless it was about or for Jesus Christ. Panas made her intentions known to her uncle and parents that she wished to become a professed religious due to her maturing vocation. Her uncle and her parents opposed this and attempted to dissuade her but Fritz encouraged her and helped her leave her home so that she could enter the Fabriano convent on 11 October 1917. Panas assumed the religious habit on 19 April 1918 and became named as \\"Maria Costanza\\" before making her initial profession on 8 May 1919. Her solemn profession was made into the hands of the abbess on 9 May 1922. Panas was later elected on 19 May 1927 as the novice mistress and later on 22 June 1936 was elected as abbess; she retained that position until 1952 though was voted abbess once more in 1955 and held the position until her death. Panas began to feel the effects of ill health in the 1950s such as deteriorating sight but in 1959 grew ill. But on 19 February 1960 her health declined due to crippling arthritis that forced her to her bed for the remainder of her life. Panas also suffered from asthma and phlebitis in addition to a series of heart problems and often suffered from nausea due to high fevers she often had to struggle with. Panas was also elected in the 1950s to the Capuchin Poor Clare Federation for the central provinces despite her serious ill health which started to trouble her since around 1955. Her ill health continued to decline at a gradual pace over time and she offered her sufferings for Pope John XXIII and for a good outcome to the Second Vatican Council which had been opened in late 1962. Learning about the death of her friend Fritz just a short time before her death caused her distress and the pope's illness also caused her distress. Panas died in her room at 11:00am on 28 May 1963. Her remains were later relocated from their burial site in mid-1977. Saint Padre Pio - despite never having even met Panas but who knew about her - referred to her as \\"the beloved creature of God\\" and perceived her holiness to \\"shine like a star\\". ==Beatification process== The beatification process was launched on 23 May 1983 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) edict and titled Panas as a Servant of God. The diocesan investigation into her life and reputation for holiness opened in the Fabriano-Matelica diocese on 10 October 1983 and was closed sometime later on 17 April 1988 before all documentation collected was sealed in boxes and sent to the C.C.S. in Rome who would begin their own investigation based on the evidence submitted. The C.C.S. issued a decree that validated the diocesan process on 12 November 1993 as having complied with their regulations for conducting causes. The postulation - officials in charge of the cause - compiled and submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for further investigation in 1998. This dossier was the accumulation of all evidence collected during the diocesan investigation and was a position paper designed to assess her reputation for holiness based on documents and witness interrogatories. Theologians met and approved the cause after having reviewed the dossier on 12 May 2015 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 4 October 2016. Panas became titled as Venerable on 10 October 2016 after Pope Francis confirmed that she had lived a model life that demonstrated heroic virtue. Her beatification depends upon the papal confirmation of a miracle which is in most cases a healing that neither science or medicine can explain. The Ancona archdiocese investigated one such case from 2010 until 2019 and sent its findings to the C.C.S. in Rome for further medical assessment. The current postulator for this cause is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni. ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN Category:1896 births Category:1963 deaths Category:20th- century Christian nuns Category:20th-century Italian educators Category:20th- century Italian people Category:20th-century Italian women Category:20th- century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Capuchin Poor Clares Category:Italian Roman Catholic abbesses Category:Italian Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Italian schoolteachers Category:People from the Province of Belluno Category:Poor Clare abbesses Category:Roman Catholic religious educators Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis Category:20th-century women educators ","title":"Maria Costanza Panas"},{"id":"60272345","text":"Javier \\"Javi\\" Pérez de Lucía Burgos (born 29 March 1996) is a Spanish footballer who most recently played for Los Angeles FC in Major League Soccer. == Career == ===Youth & College=== Pérez joined Valencia aged 5-years old and played at youth levels through the club for 15 years.

Its objective was the assassination of Robert Mugabe at his residence in Maputo, Mozambique. == Background == The Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) had been monitoring Robert Mugabe's movements in Maputo, Mozambique. He was the leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) liberation movement in exile. The initial plan involved a 4 Reconnaissance Regiment (4RR) boat team using zodiacs from a South African Navy submarine to infiltrate a Rhodesian SAS team into Maputo to attack the residence of Mugabe on the Avinida Don Maria Secunda. A reconnaissance mission to Maputo was conducted of potential landing sites and routes to the target were conducted prior to the operation. MV Johan Hugo, a South African collier which routinely visited Maputo was used to infiltrated two undercover intelligence operatives, Major Wilson and Lt. Peter Sutcliffe, operating as South African Railways and Harbour officials. The mission proposed for a Rhodesian SAS team to be delivered to the beach landing by two zodiacs piloted by members of 4RR, launched offshore off Inhaca Island from a South African strike craft. The strike craft would then return to Durban and the raid team would be recovered by a South African submarine which would return them to Durban as well. The operation would be known as Lark 1 and Lark 2. == Order of Battle == ===South African forces=== * Operations Commander – Captain Peter Fougstedt * 4 Reconnaissance Regiment – Cmdt Malcolm Kinghorn (Mission Commander) * SAS Johanna van der Merve - Cdr Evert Groenewald * SAS PW Botha - Cdr Errol Massey-Hicks ===Rhodesian forces=== * Ten members of Rhodesian SAS Zebra Group – Major Grahame Wilson (Raid Commander) * CIO operatives == Operation == ===Lark 1=== During November 1978, the South African submarine left Durban first and on arrival off Maputo had to wait two days for weather conditions to improve before launching the zodiac's of the 4RR boat team to conduct an onshore reconnaissance by two members of the SAS. After a short but successful reconnoitre of the landing site, they returned to the submarine. The submarine would later rendezvous with the strike-craft and transferred the boat team and SAS raiders to the craft. The strike-craft launched the raid boats and crews and they head west to the Maputo shoreline. One of the raid boats was damaged en route to the landing site and could not keep up endangering the raid timetable. A decision was made and the boats returned to the submarine which then towed them until it could meet up with the strike-craft which had been recalled from its return trip to Durban and re-embarked them for reuse in any further mission. ===Lark 2=== The second chance began late December when the submarine SAS Johanna van der Merve left Cape Town but soon experienced engine issues and had to limp into East London for repairs. With repairs completed it resume its mission and headed up the coast to Mozambique. The strike-craft left Durban on Christmas Eve and headed north too. The two met up and the strike-craft launched the raiding boats which made it to the landing beach. The target was confirmed as being at home by their CIO contact and the raiding party headed to their target while the raiding boats remained 50m offshore. The raiding party found Mugabe's home empty including no staff. Waiting there as long as they could, the raiding party then returned to the beach and were picked up by the two boats and eventually made contact with the submarine. The submarine towed the boats back to the strike-craft and they were re-embarked and both vessels returned to Durban. == Aftermath == Poor intelligence on the ground in Maputo was the only reason the mission was not successful. The use of the navy vessels, the launch of the zodiac's to shore, the raid on the home and the retrieval of the raiders had gone as planned. == References == Category:Conflicts in 1978 Category:Military history of Mozambique Category:Battles and operations of the South African Border War Category:Cross-border operations of South Africa Category:Operations involving South African special forces Category:1978 in Mozambique Category:1978 in Rhodesia Category:1978 in South Africa Category:Failed assassination attempts Category:Military operations of the Rhodesian Bush War involving South Africa ","title":"Operation Lark"},{"id":"60272600","text":"The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (abbreviated NFID) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to educating the public and medical community about infectious diseases.

The reserve is the only wildlife sanctuary in Gauteng that offers Big five game free walks and is available for visitors to explore. It covers an area of approximately 21,000 hectares. Dinokeng is the language of the baTswana and baPedi people, translated as “a river place” and the reserve is named for the many rivers that flow through it on their way to joining the Limpopo and Orange rivers. ==History== The Dinokeng Game Reserve is part of the Gauteng government's “Blue IQ\\" project (an entity of the Gauteng Department of Economic Development). The initiatives for conservation taken by the Gauteng Provincial Government has led to the establishment of the Dinokeng Game Reserve that has promoted the concept of ecotourism in Dinokeng. Back in 1997, at the time, the Premier of Gauteng, Tokyo Sexwale, announced a project to develop “Big Five” wild animal sanctuaries in the northeastern part of Pretoria. The main purpose of the government to build Dinokeng Game Reserve is to create tourism through the use of local natural resources, thereby increasing the employment rate and living conditions of local people. The goal is to promote local socio-economic development through the development of “all Africa” destinations, especially those that are historically disadvantaged. The government will help with this project and will work with local landowners to attract private sector investment and ultimately achieve a self-sufficient tourism-based local economy. The Gauteng Provincial Government and more than 170 landowners have developed the concept that ecotourism can be a source of sustainable rural employment for rural communities. The formal planning of Dinokeng and negotiations with landowners began in early 2000. The Dinokeng Game Reserve was officially opened on September 22, 2011, Big five animals such as leopard, lion, elephant, and buffalo were gradually introduced。Until 2018, a group of black rhinoceros wasintroduced into the reserve, making it the Big 5 Reserve in the true sense. ==Geography and Climate== Dinokeng Game Reserve is located in Hammanskraal, west of Pretoria, and northeast quadrant of Gauteng, 130 km (81 mi) from Johannesburg, close to the western N1 and N4 motorways. It covers an area of approximately 21,000 ha (52,000 acres). It has latitude of 25°40'00\\"S and 25°10'00\\" desert longitude 28°15'00\\"E and 28°40'00\\"E including the current 18,500 ha (46,000 acres). The Dinokeng area experiences summer rainfall patterns in the form of thunderstorms, which are changeable and varied. Most of the rainfall occurs during the summer, and from December to February, temperatures rise to more than 20 degrees. Rainfall varies from 350 mm (14 in) to 750 mm (30 in) per season. The UVB sunburn index is highest at this time of the year, thereby it is recommended to apply sunscreen regularly. In winter, from May to August, the temperature is relatively mild, sunshine is sufficient, but the temperature difference is large in one day, cold in the morning and evening, and sometimes may drop to zero. During a year, the temperature varies between 0° and 40° with a long-term daily average of 21°. The South area of Dinokeng has a relatively mild climate with hot summers and usually rains in the afternoon. It is cool to very cold in winter. The Dinokeng Game Reserve is free of malaria. Temperature range: 0–40 °C (32–104 °F). ==Wildlife== Bird at Dinokeng Game Reserve In addition to the Big five animals(lion, leopard, elephant, cape buffalo and rhinoceros), there are cheetahs, giraffes, zebras, brown hyenas, wildebeests, red hartebeests, tsessebe, eland, kudu, impalas, antelopes, ostrich, monkey, hippopotamus, crocodiles. And more than three hundred species of birds, including, Ostriches, Guineafowl, Turacos, Herons, Avocets, Plovers, Jacanas, Hornbills, Kingfishers, Woodpeckers, Bulbuls, Starlings, thrushes, weavers, Waxbills, osprey, the endangered blue crane and a pair of breeding martial eagles. Among them, martial eagles have been classified as vulnerable species by ICUN. Also, Dinokeng Game Reserve is one of South Africa's main bird watching sites, second only to the Ndumo Game Reserve in the St Lucia area in terms of the number of birds. Due to the unique environment, the relative positions of water, grass and bushes are very close, which attracts various species of birds. ==Tourism== Many adventure tourism companies are located in the metropolitan areas of South Africa, which is an important part of the South African urban tourism market. Dinokeng is one of the popular tourist destinations in Gauteng that offers the natural, historical and cultural sites for the visitors. There are four famous tourist hubs, Dinokeng Central, A Birder's Paradise, the Roodeplaat Dam, and the Dinokeng Game Reserve. Boat cruises, self-drive tours, professional game-drives, cultural tours, fishing, spa treatments, hot air ballooning, and restaurants are available here. In the Dinokeng Game Reserve, users of self-driving routes can choose from three different picnic sites along the route. These picnic sites are built and maintained by private landowners who do not charge for use unless they want visitors to leave these locations. Like most picnic spots in the game reserve, in order to provide a tighter jungle encounter, they are not fenced. During the game drives, visitors are asked to use the cars in the protected area instead of their own because those cars minimize the damage and erosion of the soil. In order to avoid excessive interruptions to animals, people are allowed to do game drives only at certain times, one is when the animal is awake in the morning, and the other is when the animals return to the shelter in the evening. Dinokeng Game Reserve tries to make travel more than enjoyment but to integrate learning and promote attitude and behavioral change. There are many posters of endangered species in the reserve, to appeal to locals and tourists to protect animals. Camping visitors are expected to use existing camping camps to prevent the felling of trees. One measurement, Dinokeng Game Reserve has taken is to use a hot air balloon to show visitors from an aerial perspective. When visitors saw wildlife activities and some documentaries filmed, it helped them to connect with nature. People who encountered this experience will more likely assume responsibility for protecting the natural environment. ==Conservation== Dinokeng game reserve partnered with the South African government to enforce laws that protect the natural resources of protected areas. Most employees in Dinokeng Game Reserves are from local residents living in protected areas and local residents from the communities surrounding the Reserve. At Dinokeng, it implemented different actions that helped spread environmental awareness to surrounding communities and visitors. Wildlife and Ecological Investment (WEI) conducted ecological surveys and biodiversity monitoring in the Dinokeng Game Reserve. Protected areas use the data collected and analyzed by WEI to review changes in protected areas, and management can gain insight into the operation and health of protected areas. In addition, baseline data can contribute to future professional research or management decisions. === Lion Conservation === In fact, there are just two large enough wildlife sanctuaries to self-regulate, Kruger National Park and Kgalagadi Park in South Africa. All other reserves such as the Dinokeng game reserve must be managed by people to maintain a predator-prey balance and avoid inbreeding. The Dinokeng game reserve is a member of the Lions Management Forum (LiMF), a community of reserve managers from all over the country who shares management experience, discusses and finds a management solution that is suitable for long-term subsistence of lions. Although the Dinokeng game reserve has successfully managed the total number of lions through selective contraception, the reserve must address the existence of too many young men. In a vast ecosystem, nature will provide solutions. As sexual maturity, young males will be driven out by the dominant males, and eventually, they will find new pride for themselves. But this natural rule is not applicable to the small reserves, such as Dinokeng. Pressure from the dominant male lion has caused young males to try to escape from the reserve. This can cause serious damage to the perimeter of the reserve. At Dinokeng game reserve, managers make decisions based on evidence and apply ethical principles to determine the management scheme for lions. They value the overall ecosystem approach rather than species-specific approaches, consistent with regional and international laws, policies, guidelines and strategies. === Cheetah Conservation === The cheetah is the second most threatened carnivore in South Africa after the African wild dog. They are listed as endangered species in South Africa. Cheetahs have disappeared from 76% of Africa's historical geographic regions and almost all of Asia's vast historical regions. In the past 13,000 years, cheetahs have been killed because of threats to livestock and human security. Over time, due to crop cultivation and urban development, the cheetah population has been insufficiently spaced. Most importantly, wildlife and humans do not coexist well. One way to deal with this problem is to establish wildlife sanctuaries and isolate humans from animals to ensure the safety of both parties. The challenge with this solution is the limitation of natural gene flow. Wild cheetahs appear in three locations in South Africa. First, huge reserves, such as Kruger National Park and Kgalagadi, with a large enough gene pool with more than 600 cheetahs in total, so they do not require human intervention and management. Second, in the farmland on the border of Botswana, the free-roaming population is 350–400. Third, there are about 340 scattered cheetahs distributed in 54 reserves including the Dinokeng game reserve. Each protected area has an average of 6 or 7 cheetahs, which means that inbreeding is a problem that needs to be avoided. Therefore, the Dinokeng game reserve is part of the EWT (Endangered Wildlife Trust) Cheetah Metapopulation project. The purpose of the Metapopulation project is to prevent this inbreeding and to ensure the long- term viability of cheetahs in small fenced reserves, also ensure the long-time genetic and demographic integrity of the collective population. ==Administration== Dinokeng Game Reserve has a Public-private partnership because it requires some local landowners to work with the South African government to open up the land into a wildlife area that combines tourism and conservation. Public funds are used for the planning, management, and coordination of the Dinokeng project, while private landowners are able to retain ownership of the land. Environmental management frameworks (EMF), as a strategic environmental spatial planning effort is accepted as a key component of the municipal spatial planning process and aims to promote sustainable development through a holistic planning platform. Regional planning initiatives such as EMF projects and regional space development frameworks work in the same space and thus contribute to strengthening the planning framework. EMF processes form a more integrated planning platform by bringing together stakeholders in both physical and virtual environments. In the case of Dinokeng Game Reserve, EMF is also concerned with the goal of pointing the plan to a self-sustaining tourism economy. In order to ensure the sustainable development of various natural activities, EMF has established resources and set parameters. This initiative directly or indirectly influence the planning decisions for natural resources. ==References== ==External links== * *Martial Eagles Mating A sighting of the largest African eagle, mating at a nesting site in Dinokeng Game Reserve.

The dish is common in central Luzon, most notably in the province of Pampanga. Angkak may also be omitted, especially in western central Luzon, resulting in a white-colored version. Burong isda variants are usually named after the fish they were made with; e.g. burong bangus for burong isda made with bangus (milkfish). Shrimp versions of the dish are known as burong hipon or balao-balao. Burong isda is very similar to other fermented fish and rice dishes of Asia, including narezushi of Japanese cuisine and pla ra of Thai cuisine.

Economic protests also took place in the Gaza Strip. The deadliest incident of civil unrest in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein resulted in its Prime Minister being replaced. Sustained civil disobedience in Sudan resulted in the overthrow of president Omar al-Bashir in a military coup d'état, on the 3 June 2019 Khartoum massacre of protestors, and the transfer of power from a military junta to a combined military–civilian Sovereignty Council that is legally committed to a 39-month transition to democracy. The alternative names \\"New Arab Spring\\" and \\"Arab Spring 2.0\\" refer to similarity with the preceding Arab Spring wave of pro-democracy protests which took place in 2010–2012. ==Context and background== Tesbih Habbal and Muzna Hasnawi, Syrian editors writing in The Nation in October 2019, argued that the 2018–2019 sustained street protests in the Arab world starting with Sudan in December 2018, Algeria in February 2019, Egypt and Iraq in September and October 2019, Syria and Lebanon in October 2019, constituted a second wave of the process that started with the 2010–2011 Arab Spring. Syrian protestors in October held signs stating, \\"Syria—Egypt—Iraq: You've revived the spirit of the Arab people, from the [Atlantic] Ocean to the [Persian] Gulf!\\" Habbal and Hansawi described the process as having \\"profoundly changed the political consciousness of the region\\", overcoming fear of political activity and \\"setting a crucial precedent for challenging the persistence of authoritarianism\\". Habbal and Hansawi argued that the October protests in Syria \\"[proved] that even ruthless repression and tyranny cannot deter the resistance.\\" Habbal and Hansawi argued that the new wave of protests frequently included usage of the slogan \\"Al-shab yurid isqat al- nizam!\\" (The people want the fall of the regime!) used during the 2010–2011 Arab Spring. ==Timeline by country== === Morocco === The Moroccan protests from 2018–2020 were not isolated and stemmed from problems that have existed since the Arab Spring came to Morocco. The riots and civil unrest were specifically resulting from the Hirak Rif Movement in 2016 and 2017 followed by a lack of reform on behalf of Mohammed VI of Morocco. The aftermath of the Hirak Rif protests in 2016 and 2017 has led to the imprisonment, detainment and trial of what is thought to be more than 400 protesters, journalists and political activists. After a lengthy trial period, which took until April 2019, to uphold the prison sentences of dozens of activists for up to 20 years. Several activists were sentenced to 20 years in prison including the leader of the protests Nasser Zefzafi. The upholding of these sentences sparked outrage among the relatives of the accused and brought thousands to the streets in protest of corruption and government indifference for the current standard of living. In May of 2019 after renewed protests and demonstrations over the sentencing of Hirak Rif protesters the King pardoned an unknown number of protesters as a part of a royal pardon. It was the Kings way of marking 20 years on the throne but many see this as an excuse to suppress demonstrations and cool tensions with the protesters but give the impression that he is not making any concessions. The internet has allowed Moroccan citizens to express their discontent with the government and recently soccer stadiums have become a major outlet for the expression of discontent. One such chant: 'Fbladi Delmouni' has gone viral since erupting from numerous stadium protests and has gained worldwide attention. The mostly young football crowds gather in the tens of thousands in Moroccan soccer club stadiums. Football stadiums offer protesters a sort of free haven to voice their cries for the injustices they face. Fbladi Delmouni literally translates to: \\"In my country they oppress me.\\" There are a number of different chants with lyrics that sometimes change significantly from one parody to the other, however the reoccurring them of criticizing the government and the poor standard of living is present. These issues at its core, while they were exacerbated by the Death of Mouhcine Fikri, are due to the lack of a suitable standard of living for the Moroccan people. Massive projects have been taken underway to improve the infrastructure and development of the country but the young and poor people feel that their needs are still being ignored. One such project is to be Africa's first high speed train running from Casablanca to Tangier. The extensive renovations in the Rabat airport is another such project. The problem with these recent developments is that the majority of Moroccans that live in poverty do not benefit from them. Many of the nations poor live in rural areas in the countryside and do not benefit from flying in new airports or using high speed trains. Many still suffer from the poor quality of transportation within major cities like the bus system in Casablanca. and connecting smaller cities and towns within Morocco. Moroccans lack basic access to food and water and 22% of the country is unemployed. These recent projects have exacerbated the economic disparity between social classes in Morocco and generate more social unrest among the poor. One recent protest started in late 2017 and continued strong into 2018 over the lack of food and water. In Sidi Boulalam, a small village outside Essaouira, a stampede occurred when supplies arrived to the marketplace which resulted in the trampling and death of at least 15 people. It is worse in the interior of Morocco in places like Zagora, a small village in the southeastern desert of Morocco, where for the past 15 years people have been surviving off drinking imported bottled water. ===Jordan=== The 2018 Jordanian protests started as a general strike organized by more than 30 trade unions on the 31st of May 2018 after the government of Hani Mulki submitted a new tax law to Parliament. The bill followed IMF-backed austerity measures adopted by Mulki's government since 2016 that aimed to tackle Jordan's growing public debt. Although Jordan had been relatively unscathed from the violence that swept the region following the 2011 Arab Spring, its economy had taken a hit from the surrounding turmoil and from an influx of a large number of Syrian refugees into the country. Jordan also hosts a large contingent of Iraqi and Palestinian refugees, further straining its finances. The UNHCR places Jordan as the world's second largest host of refugees per capita. The day following the strike on May 31, the government raised fuel and electricity prices responding to an increase in international oil prices. This led to crowds of protesters pouring onto the 4th circle, in Amman, near the Prime Ministry's offices that night. Other Jordanians also gathered across the country in protest of the measure in unprecedented large numbers. On 1 June King Abdullah intervened and ordered the freeze of the price hikes; the government acquiesced but said the decision would cost the treasury $20 million. The protests continued for four days until Mulki submitted his resignation to the King on 4 June, and Omar Razzaz, his Education Minister, became Prime Minister. Protests only ceased after Razzaz announced his intention of withdrawing the new tax bill. The protests have not been led by traditional opposition groups like the Muslim Brotherhood or leftists, but by diverse crowds from the middle and poor classes. Although some protesters set aflame tires and blocked roads multiple nights, protests were largely peaceful and few casualties were reported. They were staged after daylight hours as it was during the month of Ramadan. ===Tunisia=== The 2018 Tunisian protests were a series of protests occurring throughout Tunisia. Beginning January 2018, protests erupted in multiple towns and cities across Tunisia over issues related to the cost of living and taxes. As of 9 January, the demonstrations had claimed at least one life, and revived worries about the fragile political situation in Tunisia. The Popular Front, an alliance of leftist opposition parties, called for continued protests against the government's \\"unjust\\" austerity measures while Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed denounced the violence and called for calm, claiming that he and his government believe 2018 \\"would be the last difficult year for Tunisians\\". ===Iraq=== 2 October 2019 in Iraq The 2018–2019 Iraqi protests over deteriorating economic conditions and state corruption started in July 2018 in Baghdad and other major Iraqi cities, mainly in the central and southern provinces. During the nationwide protests erupting in October 2019, Iraqi security forces killed over 500 people and over 27,000 have been injured, leading Iraq's president Barham Salih to call the actions of security forces \\"unacceptable.\\" Some police have also been killed in the protests. The protests are the deadliest unrest in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein, with the death toll reaching 511 by 2 January 2020 and 669 by 13 January 2020. ===Algeria=== 10 May 2019 in Bejaia Province, Algeria The 2019 Algerian protests, also called Revolution of Smiles or Hirak Movement, began on 16 February 2019, ten days after Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his candidacy for a fifth presidential term in a signed statement. These protests, without precedent since the Algerian Civil War, have been peaceful and led the military to insist on Bouteflika's immediate resignation, which took place on 2 April 2019. By early May, a significant number of power- brokers close to the deposed administration, including the former president's younger brother Saïd, had been arrested. ===Egypt=== The 2019 Egyptian protests consisted of protests by thousands of people in Cairo, Alexandria, Damietta and five other Egyptian cities starting on 20 and 21 September 2019 in which the protestors called for President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to be removed from power. Security forces responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets and, , arrests had been made, based on data from the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms and the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information. Prominent arrestees included human rights lawyer Mahienour el-Massry, journalist and former leader of the Constitution Party Khaled Dawoud and two professors of political science at Cairo University, Hazem Hosny and Hassan Nafaa. The wave of arrests was the biggest in Egypt since Sisi formally became president in 2014. Human Rights Watch called for all those arrested for peacefully expressing their opinions to be released immediately. Amnesty International described the Sisi government being \\"shaken to its core\\" by 20–21 September protests and that the authorities had \\"launched a full-throttle clampdown to crush demonstrations and intimidate activists, journalists and others into silence\\". Two thousand people, including Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) representatives, protested in Khartoum on 26 September in support of Waleed Abdelrahman Hassan, a Sudanese anti-Islamist student detained by Egyptian authorities, who gave a forced confession on MBC Masr television. The SPA stated, \\"the era when Sudanese citizens were humiliated inside or outside their country has gone and will never return\\". The Sudanese Foreign Ministry summoned the Egyptian ambassador and Waleed Abdelrahman Hassan was freed on 2 October 2019. ===Gaza=== The 2019 Gaza economic protests, dubbed as We Want to Live protests, began on February, initiating with the popular call \\"We want to live\\" by a group of politically unaffiliated media activists. The group has been nicknamed the 14 March movement. The protests aim at high costs of living and tax hikes in the Gaza Strip. ===Lebanon=== 19 October 2019 in Beirut The Lebanese protests are a series of protests that constitute a reaction against sectarian rule, stagnant economy, unemployment, endemic corruption in the public sector, legislation (such as banking secrecy) that is perceived to shield the ruling class from accountability. It is suspected that the direct trigger to the protests were due to the planned imposed taxes on gasoline, tobacco and online phone calls such as through WhatsApp, as protests started breaking out right after unanimous Cabinet approval of the WhatsApp taxes, due to be ratified by 22 October. In contrast to the 2005 Cedar Revolution, and similarly to a process started in the 2015–2016 Lebanese protests, the 2019 protests were non-sectarian, crossing the Sunni–Shia Muslim sociological and religious divide and bypassing traditional political party alignments. ===Libya=== Street protests took place in August and September 2020 over issues of poor provision of services in several cities in Libya, including both cities controlled by the Government of National Accord (GNA) in the west (Tripoli, Misrata, Zawiya) and by the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east of Libya (Benghazi). The de facto LNA-associated government led by Abdullah al-Thani offered its resignation on 13 September 2020 in response to the protests. ===Sudan=== ====Revolution==== The Sudanese Revolution was a major shift of political power in Sudan that started with street protests throughout Sudan on 19 December 2018 and continued with sustained civil disobedience for about eight months, during which the 11 April 2019 Sudanese coup d'état deposed President Omar al-Bashir after thirty years in power, 3 June Khartoum massacre took place under the leadership of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) that replaced al-Bashir, and in July and August 2019 the TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change alliance (FFC) signed a Political Agreement and a Draft Constitutional Declaration legally defining a planned 39-month phase of transitional state institutions and procedures to return Sudan to a civilian democracy. In August and September 2019, the TMC formally transferred executive power to a mixed military–civilian collective head of state, the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, and to a civilian prime minister (Abdalla Hamdok) and a mostly civilian cabinet, while judicial power was transferred to Nemat Abdullah Khair, Sudan's first female Chief Justice. ====Later protests==== *Late-2019 Sudanese protests – a continuation of street protests during the 39-month planned transitionary institution period ===Syria=== *2020 Suweida protests – In southwest Syria, hundreds of protesters gathered on the streets, demanding for the removal of President Assad’s government amid worsening economic conditions. ==Summary of conflicts by country== {class=\\" sortable collapsible\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10%;\\"Country !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10%;\\"Date started !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15%;\\"Status of protests !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:35%;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Outcome !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10%;\\"Death toll !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15%;\\"Situation -   Ended in February 2018 2018 budget repealed  1  2018 Tunisian protests -   Ended on 7 June 2018 Prime Minister Hani Mulki resigns and is replaced with Omar Razzaz. * Tax bill withdrawn   2018 Jordanian protests -   Ongoing as of July 2020 Resignation of the Iraqi Prime minister Adil Abdul- Mahdi (remained as caretaker for two months) 669  *2015–2018 Iraqi protests *2019–20 Iraqi protests -   Ongoing as of July 2020 Ousting of Omar al- Bashir in a military coup d'état *April 2019: Seizure of power by Transitional Military Council *June 2019: Khartoum massacre *September 2019: Executive power transferred to military–civilian Sovereignty Council and civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok *October 2019: Judicial power transferred to Chief Justice Nemat Khair  246  *Sudanese Revolution *Transitionary period protests -   Temporary Suspension since 20 March 2020 Resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika under pressure added by the military  3 2019–20 Algerian protests -   Ongoing as of October 2019  Protests repressed by Hamas security forces   2019 Gaza economic protests -   Protests ended on 27 September 2019; prisoners unreleased as of November 2019   2019 Egyptian protests -   Ongoing as of December 2019  Prime Ministers Saad Hariri and Hassan Diab resign.  11  2019–20 Lebanese protests -   Ended on 15 June 2020  Sacking of Prime Minister Imad Khamis.   2020 Suweida protests - - colspan=4; style=\\"text-align:right;\\"Total death toll and other consequences: 926+ (combined estimate)  *2 heads of state and 3 heads of government left office as part of the events. - colspan=6 } ==See also== *Arab Winter *Hirak Rif Movement *2019 Sudanese coup d'état *2019–20 Iranian protests *List of protests in the 21st century ==References== Category:2010s coups d'état and coup attempts Category:2019 in Africa Category:2019 in Asia Category:2019 protests Category:Arab Winter Category:History of North Africa Category:History of the Middle East Category:Intifadas Category:Protest marches Category:Revolutionary waves ","title":"2018–2020 Arab protests"},{"id":"60272966","text":"Roberta is a Canadian short drama film, directed by Caroline Monnet and released in 2014.\\"Festival de Namur: Caroline Monnet, compétitrice des courts\\".

The coup was staged by a group of military officers and led by the Defense Minister and Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief, Field Marshal Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab, against the government of President Gaafar Nimeiry. ==Background== In 1983 President Gaafar Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state under Sharia law, including the non-Islamic majority southern part of the country. The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished on 5 June 1983, terminating the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972, which ended the First Sudanese Civil War. This move directly initiated the Second Sudanese Civil War in 1983. ==Coup== Andrews AFB in Maryland, arriving for a state visit to the United States on 21 November 1983, sixteen months before the 1985 coup. The Sudanese Armed Forces took control of the country on 6 April 1985 after more than a week of civil unrest, caused by increasing food prices and growing dissatisfaction with the government of President Nimeiry, who himself came to power in the 1969 coup d'état. Nimeiry was in the United States at the time of the coup. The coup was announced over the radio. The radio studios in Omdurman were heavily guarded by soldiers, who withdrew only after the announcement was made. Reportedly, there were two casualties during the coup, killed in a brief shootout as soldiers seized the state security headquarters in the capital Khartoum. ===Announcements from the new government=== In a military communique read on the radio on 7 April, Dahab claimed the military had seized control of the country because of \\"the worsening situation and the political crisis, which worsens continuously\\". In a later communique read on the Radio Omdurman, Dahab promised political, economic and social changes. He also guaranteed freedom for the press, political organizations and religious communities. In the same communique, Dahab also promised the opening of a \\"direct dialogue\\" with the rebels in the south (predominantly Christian and animist), and the achievement of national unity \\"within the framework of equality in rights and duties\\". Dahab had issued a seven-point program which dismissed President Nimeiry and his government, suspended the Constitution and the Parliament (Central People's Assembly), dissolved the governing SSU party and declared a \\"temporary\\" state of emergency and martial law. Dahab said that the military had seized control of the country for a limited period of time, and that power would be returned \\"back to the people\\" within six months. ==Reactions== Following the announcement of the coup, tens of thousands of people poured into the streets of Khartoum, celebrating the coup. The red, green, white and black flag that Nimeiry made the flag of Sudan after the 1969 coup was pulled down by demonstrators; they also destroyed pictures of Nimeiry, including one in the reception area of the Khartoum Hilton Hotel. Shortly after the coup, Nimeiry left Washington, D.C. and arrived in Cairo. He was met at the Cairo International Airport by senior Egyptian officials (President Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal Hassan Ali and Defense Minister Field Marshal Abd Al- Halim Abu-Ghazala). Initially intending to try to return to Khartoum, Nimeiry had been dissuaded from doing that by the pilot of his Boeing 707 presidential jet and by Mubarak, on the grounds that the trip would be too dangerous. While Egyptian officials said that they were \\"very concerned\\" about the situation, the new military government of Sudan was quickly recognized by the government of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya under Col. Muammar Gaddafi, a foe of pro-Western Nimeiry. Ba'athist Syria under the presidency of Hafez al-Assad also welcomed Nimeiry's ouster. ==References== Category:Military coups in Sudan Coup d'etat Sudanese coup d'etat Category:1980s coups d'état and coup attempts Category:April 1985 events in Africa ","title":"1985 Sudanese coup d'état"},{"id":"60273010","text":"Allen Butterworth (1939–1974) was a British archaeologist and museum curator. ==Biography== Butterworth was born in Stockport.

The film is inspired by the Finnish painting by Hugo Simberg, The Wounded Angel Angel of the North is the first Finnish long feature directed by a French film-maker. == Plot == Angel of the North is based on Hugo Simberg's painting: The Wounded Angel. It depicts two teenagers carrying a wounded angel on a stretcher in a barren landscape. Since its creation in 1903, this work, elected \\"the most beloved\\" by the Finns, has become a national enigma because the painter has never provided an explanation for it. For 89 minutes, people of all ages and all walks of life ponder and give their personal explanation : children, artists, farmers, a priest, a paramedic, a handicapped person, a therapist... It raises questions about death and the afterlife, Nordic melancholy, art, the existence of angels and hope. The scene of the painting is reconstructed with actors, and at the end of the film, like a sequel to the painting, the angel is taken by the two boys on a boat to a distant shore.

Sofia Anne Stanley (28 January 1873 – 24 September 1953) was the first female police officer and the first commander of the Metropolitan Police's Women Patrols from 1919 to 1922. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Stanley was born Sofia Dalgairns in Palermo to the Scottish civil and mechanical engineer, David Croll Dalgairns (1839–1885) and his wife Annie Marie Christine Waygood (1852–1891). Stanley was raised a Presbyterian, although converted to High Church Anglicanism as an adolescent. Whilst very young she worked as the headmistress of St Mary's School in Poona and married Henry Johnson Stanley, an engineer for the Madras Railway, at St Mary's Church in Osterley in November 1899.Martin Fido and Keith Skinner, The Official Encyclopedia of Scotland Yard (Virgin Books; London, 1999), pages 253-254 They had one daughter, Theodora Christine (1902–1986), who became an architect, and later moved to Switzerland by the time of her mother's death. ===Policing=== Stanley became interested in police work in 1914 when she was visited by a former police officer in the Indian Civil Service. Then living in Southsea, she became a Women's Patrol Leader in Portsmouth for the National Union of Women Workers (since 1918 known as the National Council of Women of Great Britain). In March 1917 the Union appointed her as a Supervisor of its Women's Patrols in London where she raised the number of women patrolling full-time from 37 to 80.\\"Women Police Wanted - A Successful Bristol School\\", Western Daily Press, 23 July 1917, p. 3. She regularly reported the Patrols' activities to Sir Edward Henry, Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, comparing it favourably with the work of the Women's Police Service (WPS). The Metropolitan Women Police Patrols were officially launched on 17th February 1919. Its officers were not given the power to arrest and operated based on the style of Stanley's patrols rather than the WPS, which the Commissioner believed had links to the Suffragette Nina Boyle. Stanley was put in control of the patrols with the specially-created rank of Supervisor. By February 1919 fifty women had been recruited, rising to 112 by 1922. The Geddes Axe recommended their complete abolition but Stanley worked with the first woman MP to take her seat, Nancy Astor, to force the Home Secretary Edward Shortt to leave a cadre of 20 women. However, one of the Patrols' early officers Lilian Wyles complained against Stanley's tactics, leading to a disciplinary enquiry which found Stanley guilty of intriguing against Shortt and then attempting to cover this up. As a result she was dismissed and her role as the head of women in the Met given instead to Bertha Clayden. ===Later life=== In later years, Stanley moved to Calcutta where she took up a role with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. She also assisted the local police in opposing child prostitution and brothels. In 1939 she returned to the England, where she died at 27 Queen Anne's Grove in Bedford Park from injuries sustained in a traffic accident.

It served in the East African Campaign in 1916–17. ==Origin== 134th (Cornwall) Heavy Battery was formed in July 1915 by Nos 1 (Padstow) and 2 (Penzance) Heavy Btys of the Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall's) Royal Garrison Artillery, a coast defence unit of the pre-war part-time Territorial Force.Frederick, p. 696.Frederick, pp. 699–702. It went to Woolwich about 250 strong on 12 August, from where it supplied reinforcements to RGA units fighting on the Western Front, at Gallipoli and in Egypt. On 20 November the battery was ordered to mobilise as a howitzer battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery for service in the East African Campaign. With a strength of 124 all ranks it embarked at Southampton on 26 December 1915, arriving at Mombasa on 1 February 1916. At Maktau it took over four Indian Army pattern 5.4-inch howitzers, which were drawn by oxen.134th Hvy Bty War Diary December 1915–December 1917, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, WO 95/5314/14.'Allocation of Heavy Batteries RGA', TNA file WO 95/5494/2.Hordern, p. 221.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 318.Drake, p. 173.134th Hvy Bty at Great War Forum. 633 Company Army Service Corps was formed on 12 January 1916 as the Ammunition Column (Motor Transport) for the battery.'Allocation of Mechanical Transport Companies ASC', TNA file WO 95/5494.Young, Annex Q. ==Service== 5.4-inch howitzer and crew at Morogoro, 1916–17. ===Latema Nek=== On 5 March the battery received orders to join in the Kilimanjaro offensive with 2nd Division of the East African Expeditionary Force. It moved out via the Serengeti rail head and on 9 March took part in a demonstration against Salaita Hill (where the Imperial forces had been repulsed the previous month). Its first position was out of range of the enemy positions because of inaccurate maps. However, it moved forward and engaged the hill with Lyddite shells until the infantry reached the top. Next day it crossed the drift on the Lumi River and on 11 March it fired in support of an attack on Latema Hill (the Battle of Latema Nek). After the German withdrawal the battery bivouacked at Taveta and then at Himo until May.Anderson, pp. 114–6.Hordern, pp. 243–5; Note I, p. 248. On 21 May the battery began a long march along the Pangani River as part of the Force Reserve. It also manned the ammunition column for the 13th Howitzer Bty (a section of 11th (Hull) Heavy Bty, RGA), whose 5-inch howitzers were towed by lorries but relied on oxen for ammunition supply. For part of June the gunners were employed in road-making, then marched with the force reserve in a wide turning movement. Once back on the road the battery had to wait for its lorries to bring up supplies while its smiths and fitters worked to repair the German light railway. It spent July camped at Lukigura Bridge and then Msiha. The battery was never deployed 'in action' during this whole time, though it was sometimes under fire from longer-ranged German guns.Drake, pp, 165–73.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 323–4.Hordern, p. 289. Breech of a 5.4-inch howitzer. ===Morogoro camp=== During August the battery supported the 1st East African Brigade, which was to attack Ruhungo, but flanking moves caused the Germans to retire and the guns were not needed. During the month the battery moved via Turiani and Dakawa to the Mgerengere River. On 28 August it reached Morogoro. Here the offensive was halted by rain, exhaustion and German defences on the River Mgeta, so the force camped and reorganised. The battery commander was appointed post commandant of Morogoro and the battery carried out garrison duty in the town until 20 December, while the motor transport section brought up supplies and ammunition for the force.Anderson, pp. 143–8.Drake, pp. 175–8.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 325–6, 330.Hordern, p. 348.Sibley, pp. 109–13. German East Africa 1914–18. ===Tanganyika=== On 20 December the battery left Morogoro on a three-day march to Duthumi, where it stayed for the rest of the month. On 31 December it moved into prepared positions about behind the front line trenches and established an observation post (OP) on Kitoho Hill. The following day it opened fire to support the Nigerian Brigade's attack , but having ranged on the German trenches, the forward observation officer (FOO) with the Nigerians could see nothing, though reporting heavy rifle fire from a flank. That position was shelled, and the enemy were seen leaving. The battery then 'searched' the ground in front of the Nigerians, lifting its fire as they advanced. When the infantry reached the Mgeta river they found the bridge commanded by two Maxim gun positions; they withdrew a little and two of the battery's guns opened fire on these machine guns while the remainder fired on trenches and a wooded donga. At 16.30 the battery was ordered to advance towards the river as soon as the Nigerian Brigade considered it advisable. The battery could only get forward, and prepared to fire from this position at long range. However, the enemy were in retreat and the battery camped for the night. During the engagement one of the battery's guns suffered a premature shell burst, which blew away of the muzzle, killing one gunner and wounding three others.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 338–40.Drake, p. 191. The battery remained at Duthumi until 14 February 1917, when it was ordered to march back to the railway, arriving at Mikesse on 18 February. Here it handed in one of its remaining 5.4-inch howitzers and proceeded to Dar es Salaam. On 1 March it was ordered to send a detachment of one officer and 21 men with one howitzer to Lindi. The detachment boarded the SS Barjora and arrived at Lindi on 5 March, establishing their gun position on Kitolo Hill as part of the defences for Lindi. The rest of the battery moved from Dar es Salaam back to Morogoro at the end of March for training. At Lindi the detachment had no transport for their howitzer, but they crewed a 4-inch gun for the Royal Marine Artillery and a 3.7-inch trench mortar, and did some mortar and Grenade training for parties from the King's African Rifles (KAR), West Indies Regiment and 5th Light Infantry of the Indian Army. Territorial gunners training with a 5-inch howitzer before World War I. On 28 May 134th (Cornwall) Bty at Morogoro handed its two remaining 5.4-inch howitzers over to 11th (Hull) Heavy Bty for training, and took over a 5-inch howitzer from that battery. It then returned to Dar es Salaam and on 11 July took the Barjora to Lindi, where the detachment also handed in its 5.4-inch howitzer. Leaving some men to operate a Stokes mortar battery, the rest of 134th Hvy Bty (32 all ranks) with their 5-inch howitzer, were taken by a Tugboat to Mingoyo, where they bivouacked at Lower Schaadel Farm with an escort from the KAR. They adapted two Flat wagons so that the howitzer and its limber could be moved along the German light railway, hauled by local porters.Drake, p. 210. ===Advance from Lindi=== The Lindi Column began probing forward at the beginning of August and from 1 to 11 August there was a prolonged action against the enemy at Tandimuti Hill, with the howitzer firing in conjunction with the monitors HMS Mersey and Severn firing from offshore. The battery then advanced about along the rail line to a new camp, and on each of the next few days moved out to various positions for shoots on Narunyu on the bank of the Lukuledi River. On 27 August the 5-inch was registered on various targets with the aid of an observation aircraft, and then took part in a general bombardment, firing 10 rounds at each of the registered targets. That evening the 5.4-inch howitzer was brought up from Lindi to rejoin the battery. On 29 and 30 August both howitzers and the Stokes mortars fired at targets to try to get the enemy to reveal their positions, despite a large number of misfires from the old 5.4-inch. On 31 August the 5-inch bombarded Nirunge Hill, from where an enemy patrol had been harassing the KAR picquets. On most days in September one or both howitzers went out to shell Kilossa Ridge or the enemy-held bomas and trenches in front of Narunyu.Anderson, pp. 233–5, 243.Sibley, pp. 130–1. The Lindi Column was now reinforced. On 15 September, 11th (Hull) Hvy Bty's last 5-inch howitzer arrived from Morogoro for 134th Hvy Bty, together with the rest of 134th's men who had been at Morogoro and two of its Napier lorries.Drake, p. 213. Lindi Column resumed its advance against Narunyu on 23 September, with one column making a two-day flank march to cross the Lukuledi while the battery bombarded the German positions. The flank move caused the Germans to abandon their positions. The roads were impassable for the heavy lorries, so the two howitzers with the force reserve (one 5-inch had blown out an oil pipe in its recoil mechanism) had to move up on their railway trollies to the end of the line at Mtua (28 September) and then be dragged forward by porters while light Ford cars brought up ammunition. On 30 September the guns were in position but the Germans had already retired out of range. Thereafter the battery took part in No 3 Column's pursuit, still dragged by porters until the Napiers caught up on 2 October. On 5 October the battery bombarded the high ground across the Nyengedi River, exchanging fire with a German gun. Daily firing continued as the column obtained a bridgehead, and then pushed the German rearguards back.Anderson, pp. 243–8. ===Mahiwa=== Between 15 and 18 October, the Lindi Column fought the Battle of Mahiwa, one of the bloodiest battles of the whole campaign, with the battery firing a large number of rounds in support of the failed attack.Anderson, pp. 248–9.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 347–9.Sibley, pp. 131–4. However, the German force had also lost heavily, and it began a retirement towards Portuguese Mozambique, harried by a few howitzer rounds each day, though spotting fall of shot in the dense bush was problematic because of wireless difficulties with the Royal Naval Air Service observation aircraft. The battery reached Ndanda on 16 November.Anderson, pp. 253–6.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 349.Sibley, pp. 134–5. ===Return to England=== German East Africa had been cleared, and the remaining German forces adopted guerrilla tactics in Mozambique. The Allied forces had to reorganise for this phase of the campaign, and 134th Hvy Bty's slow-moving howitzers returned to Nyangao on the Lukuledi by the end of the month. In December the Lindi force was broken up and all of its exhausted and sickly British and Indian units were sent home. On 10 December 134th Hvy Bty was ordered back to Lindi. It boarded the SS Salamis for Dar es Salaam, where its remaining guns were handed in.Anderson, p. 257.Drake, p. 234.Farndale, p. 251.Sibley, p. 137. On 19 December 1917, 134th (Cornwall) Heavy Battery, with 5 officers and 59 other ranks, embarked on the SS Caronia at Dar es Salaam en route for Durban and then England. 633 MT Company remained in Africa as a transport company. ==546th Siege Battery, RGA== 6-inch Mk XIX gun of an RGA siege battery. Once they returned to England, the veterans of 11th (Hull) Heavy Bty had reformed as 545th Siege Battery, RGA, and served as a 6-inch gun battery on the Western Front in the final months of the war.Drake, pp. 256–96. Similarly, the men of 134th (Cornwall) Hvy Bty were reorganised into 546th Siege Battery on 27 February 1918. This was one of only two TF siege batteries formed during the war, the other being the 309th formed by the Honourable Artillery Company. The 546th was also the last RGA siege battery to be sent overseas during World War I, reaching the Western Front on 22 August 1918.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', TNA file WO 95/5494. On 25 August 546th Siege Bty was equipped with four 6-inch guns (probably the modern Mk XIX version issued to 545th BtyDrake, p. 263.) and it served with Second Army until the Armistice with Germany.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M.

They were among the first teachers to be trained by B. K. S. Iyengar outside India. The main part of the book is on asanas, yoga postures. This is accompanied by an introduction to yoga, and sections on pranayama (yoga breathing), the philosophy of yoga, the surrender of the self including meditation, and recommended courses of asanas for different conditions. The book presents the asanas with a combination of a brief text and photographs of Mira and Shyam on a single page or a double-page spread. The book has been well received by critics, who have called it \\"an influential classic textbook\\" and a \\"backlist bestseller\\". The authors have been portrayed in some of the asanas illustrated in the book in a set of Indian postage stamps. ==Context== At the time of the book's publication, Silva, Mira, and Shyam Mehta were teachers of Iyengar Yoga at the Iyengar Yoga Institute in Maida Vale, London. Silva, mother of Shyam and Mira, records that she had a crush fracture of the spine at age 25, leading to osteoarthritis. Yoga with B. K. S. Iyengar relieved the pain, and she went on to work helping people with physical problems to practise remedial yoga. Shyam and Mira learnt yoga from Iyengar from an early age. Shyam states that yoga has given him determination and the ability to concentrate on office work. Mira had a scoliosis which she gradually overcame with yoga, eventually becoming a full-time yoga teacher. Silva ran the first yoga teacher training program approved by the Inner London Education Authority, from 1970. Mira has been called \\"the most senior [Iyengar] Yoga teacher outside India, recognised as an authority in all its aspects: asana, pranayama, philosophy and therapy.\\" ==Book== ===Publication history=== Yoga the Iyengar Way was published in paperback by Dorling Kindersley (London) in 1990. It was reprinted in 2006 by A. A. Knopf (New York) and distributed by Random House, who describe it as a \\"backlist bestseller\\". The book has been translated into Dutch, French, German, Korean, and Spanish. ===Topics covered=== The book is arranged with an introductory section, three main parts, and an appendix. * The introductory section contains a foreword by B. K. S. Iyengar; a short biographical preface by the authors; a short introduction to yoga in general; and a note on Sanskrit transliteration. * Part I is the main part of the book, with some 140 pages covering about 100 asanas. * Part II covers techniques for the mind, including pranayama (yoga breathing) and the philosophy of yoga. * Part III describes the surrender of the self and meditation, dhyana. * The appendix defines courses of asanas considered suitable for different conditions, with a set of remedial programmes. ===Approach=== The book closely integrates text and photographs, showing how to enter the pose, here Utthita Trikonasana, how to work within it, and how to use props such as yoga bricks to work correctly if the pose is found difficult. The effect is \\"rather more approachable\\" than Iyengar's own presentation. Each asana is described with a combination of short paragraphs of text and photographs (about half in colour) of Shyam or Mira Mehta. The book is in a large format, , close to A4 size, allowing for a large photograph of each asana together with several smaller ones showing details and stages for entering the pose. Some of the key Iyengar Yoga asanas such as Utthita Trikonasana are given a double-page spread; others get a single page. Each pose is named in Sanskrit (in a pale colour, giving the effect of a decorative frieze at the top of the page) and in transliteration with diacritic marks. Below that is an explanation of the meaning of the Sanskrit words, and a brief summary of what the pose achieves. Utthita Trikonasana is described in three steps, each with a small photograph the width of a column of text. A pair of small detail photographs show how to hold the ankle or to use a yoga brick for support. A 'focus' section instructs points to note in the pose. An inset photograph in the main image gives a back view, complete with detailed instructions in the caption for the attention needed to the back in the pose. A final 'Work in the posture' section instructs on the movements required to achieve a good posture in the asana. ==Reception== The scholar of religion Andrea Jain, in her study of the sociology of yoga, describes the Mehtas as \\"a family of senior Iyengar Yoga teachers.\\" Yoga Matters calls Yoga the Iyengar Way \\"an influential classic textbook.\\" The journalist and yoga teacher Ann Pizer, writing on Very Well Fit, rated it the best overall runner-up yoga book of 2019, writing that \\"the photos may look a little dated because of the unitards. However, they're almost preferable to the 'sexy' photos so often seen in more recent books.\\" Pizer comments that many practitioners see the book as a complement to Iyengar's own Light on Yoga, and that the combination of big colour illustrations and \\"explicit alignment points\\" actually make it rather more approachable. The yoga teacher and journalist Marina Jung, writing in Australian Yoga Life, called the book a \\"bestseller\\" and \\"highly influential throughout the world\\". The book's authors and their exemplary asanas are commemorated in a set of Indian postage stamps. Mira and Shyam appeared on a set of 4 stamps issued by the Indian Department of Posts in 1991: Shyam wearing blue in Bhujangasana on a 2 rupee stamp, and in Dhanurasana on a 5 rupee stamp; Mira wearing red in Ustrasana on a 6.50 rupee stamp, and in Utthita Trikonasana on a 10 rupee stamp; the images, all redrawn from photographs in the book, were described as \\"perfect postures\\". ==References== ===Primary=== These references indicate the parts of the Yoga the Iyengar Way text being discussed. ===Secondary=== ==Sources== * Category:1990 non-fiction books Category:Modern yoga books ","title":"Yoga the Iyengar Way"},{"id":"60273726","text":"Htoo Khant Lwin ( player profile at the-afc.com; born 26 October 1998) is a footballer from Burma, and an defender for Yangon United.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. ==Production== The design was built by Pacific Seacraft in the United States from 1974 to 1999, but the company went out of business in 2007. The design was acquired by Seacraft Yachts, who commenced building the design again, starting with serial number 351. Over 250 examples of the design have been completed. ==Design== The Dana 24 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a cutter sloop rig, a spooned and slightly raked stem, a nearly vertical transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller, a bowsprit and a fixed long keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 2GM20F diesel engine of . The boat's galley is located on the port side of the cabin and has a stainless steel sink and a two-burner gimballed kerosene stove. The table can swing up and stow when not in use. A second table stows under the forward \\"V\\"-berth. The head is a marine type, with a shower. It has a privacy door and is located aft on the starboard side. Additional sleeping space is provided by the dinette settees, which extend under the forward \\"V\\"-berth for extra leg room. Ventilation is provided by a forward hatch and opening bronze ports. There is an anchor chain locker, just aft of the bowsprit. The cockpit has two genoa winches and a mainsheet traveler, which is mounted at the transom. ==Operational history== In a review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"This cruiser incorporates some ingenious interior details that help provide more space. The vee berth forward is not separated from the cabin, but has storage under. In addition, the table for the opposing settees is stored under the vee berth and slides out and around the compression post supporting the cabin-top mounted mast. The setees double as berths, and additional length is attained by extending the foot of the berths under the forward berth.\\" A 2008 review in Sailing Magazine note \\"Part of the Dana 24's appeal is its traditional appearance, from its beefy bow pulpit and sweet sheerline to the chrome bronze deck hardware and teak loop handrails on the cabinhouse. This classic feel extends belowdecks, where the saloon exudes the warmth of hand-rubbed oiled teak, with teak joinery and cabinets above a teak-and-holly sole.\\" A 2010 review note, \\"Bill Crealock the designer of the Dana was simply a genius. When he designed the Dana back in the early 1980s he was about 65 years old and he used all his hard earned experience gained from a lifetime of creating and sailing yachts. The Dana may well have been one of the last yachts designed without the aid of a computer.\\" In a 2016 review in Blue Water Boats, Rosie Mac wrote, \\"Like all good boats, the Dana 24 is well balanced, fast for her size and seakindly. Her shallow draft allows for exploration in cruising grounds larger yachts cannot, and her design, now over 25 years old, is well proven with a number of ocean crossings to her credit. Yet for all her offshore capabilities she is one of a select few that can go home on a trailer.\\" ==See also== *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Achilles 24 *Challenger 24 *Columbia 24 *Islander 24 *Islander 24 Bahama *Nutmeg 24 *San Juan 24 *Seidelmann 245 *Shark 24 ==References== ==External links== *Video review Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Boats designed by W.

Libya has an embassy in Rabat and Morocco has an embassy in Tripoli, which was attacked by ISIS militants in 2015. ==History== Libya and Morocco share a relatively close bond dated from antiquity. Both are Maghreb nations and used to be under Arab conquest, as well as later adoption of Islam. However, subsequent contact between two was derived by various historic incidents: Morocco went on to develop into an independent Arab-Berber kingdom with a distinct identity; while Libya went to become part of the Ottoman Empire. The end of Ottoman Empire saw both Libya and Morocco falling under colonization, Libya was ruled under the Italians and Morocco under the French and Spanish . Libya would become the first among Maghreb nation to regain independence, as for the result of the World War II and Italian defeat; while Morocco would have to wait until 1956 to gain complete independence from France and Spain. Since then, Libya and Morocco established relations. Two countries were initially together being monarchies, with King Idris of Libya and Mohammed V of Morocco shared strong personal relationship. However, a massive wave of pan-Arabism came together affected both countries, which caused the fall of Libyan Senussi family; but its Moroccan counterparts were able to survive amidst turbulent relations. Since then, Morocco and Libya entered a tense chapter, as Libya fell under Muammar Gaddafi. Personal hostilities between two rulers soon escalated into national conflict. Gaddafi meddled on Western Sahara issue, supported Polisario; Hassan II of Morocco's secret relations with Israel caused tensions between two nations. At 1987, Gaddafi was found to have planned for a possible assassination against Hassan II, which was never materialized. Nonetheless, two countries maintained a poor relationship, and distrust from Gaddafi toward Hassan II and later, Mohammed VI of Morocco, prompted Gaddafi to have his own view distance from the Moroccan King; despite two countries used to form a political alliance at 1984 (disbanded after 1986 meeting between Hassan II with Shimon Peres). Tensions between Libya and Morocco cooled down with the re-integration of Libya to global community, but distrust between two countries still ran high. When Mohammed VI visited Libya in 2001, Gaddafi was found to have called him \\"my son\\", which was seen as an insult to Moroccan Royal family. Morocco continued to maintain a unique pro-Western orientation policy while Libya under Gaddafi maintained a pseudo and unstable policy. This divergence would remain until 2011. ==After Libyan Revolution== The 2011 Libyan War occurred as Libyans showed disdains against Gaddafi's dictatorship, and the product of Arab Spring, Morocco also suffered protests. However, Morocco was quick to throw support to Libyan revolutionaries against Gaddafi Government and denounced him in Arab League; as well as King Mohammed VI offered political reforms. After the war ended with Gaddafi's death, Morocco expected a great hope of growing tie between two countries. However, violence within Libya soon escalated into the 2014 Libyan War, which torn down much of the country. Morocco, once again, acted as a partner to solve diplomatic problems within various Libyan rival factions, brokering the UN-led faction deal in 2015 to form a unity Government. Recently however, Morocco has developed its fear toward Algeria's growing influence in Libya, and has attempted to gain hand over the country, as Algeria is Morocco's rival in North Africa. ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of Libya Category:Bilateral relations of Morocco ","title":"Libya–Morocco relations"},{"id":"60273876","text":"Valforêt is a commune in the Côte-d'Or department in eastern France.

CBC News. Eye tracking data showed that the participants tended to focus more on the eyes of white faces and the lips and noses of black faces. Given the importance of eye contact in social interaction, this result indicates that the black faces shown were being processed as members of a group rather than as individuals. Kawakami's work has also shown that people are more tolerant of racist actions than they claim. In one study, her team showed that although only 17% of people said they would be willing to partner with someone who made a racial slur, 63% of people who actually heard the slur subsequently partnered with that person.

She is mixed-race and grew up between the U.K. and Malaysia. She is of Malaysian descent on her mother's side and spent a lot of time there growing up. Ngan says that her multicultural upbringing contributed to her wanting to write diverse stories. Ngan has always been interested in intercultural relations, which she names as one of the reasons why she studied geography at the University of Cambridge, specializing in cultural geography. There, she first developed the idea for what would become her debut novel, The Elites. After graduation, she started working for a social media agency in London. Aside from writing, she is also a fashion blogger and teaches yoga. Her third novel, Girls of Paper and Fire, is inspired by her Chinese-Malaysian heritage. She currently lives in Paris. == Career == Ngan is represented by Taylor Haggerty at Root Literary. === Standalones === Her debut novel, The Elites, was published by Hot Key Books in September 2013, about a teenager who has to protect the city as a warrior because of her genetically superior DNA. Ngan names 2001 book Mortal Engines by Philip Reeve as well as the works of writers Patrick Ness and Paolo Bacigalupi as some of her influences for the novel, due to their \\"original\\" and \\"exotic\\"-feeling settings. A second novel, The Memory Keepers, about a futuristic London in which memories are currency, and following a boy who steals memories and sells them on the black market. It was published in 2014, also by Hot Key Books. Ngan had the idea for writing the novel during a family holiday in Seville, where she found herself wishing to be able to bottle up the memories and relive them again and again, a concept which ultimately served as the basis for the premise of the novel. === Girls of Paper and Fire series === Her third novel, Girls of Paper and Fire, the first in a trilogy of the same name, is set in a world in which a Demon King chooses among eight human concubines and two of them, Lei and Wren, fall for each other. Ngan says the first spark of the story originated from the idea of wanting to write about two courtesans of a demon king who fall for each other instead of for him. The novel tackles topics like sexual assault, homophobia, and the commodification of women's bodies. As a sexual abuse survivor, Ngan states that it was important for her to tackle the topics in a sensible manner, in order to prepare teens for the world and not to shelter them. It was published by Jimmy Patterson Books in November 2018. Girl of Paper and Fire debuted on the New York Times Bestseller list. The second novel in the series, Girls of Storm and Shadow, picks up right after the events of the first, following Lei and Wren as they travel the kingdom to gain favors from rebel clans after the assassination of the Demon King. Girls of Storm and Shadow was released in November 2019. The last and final novel, Girls of Fate and Fury, is scheduled for publication in 2021. == Bibliography == === Girls of Paper and Fire series === # Girls of Paper and Fire (2018) # Girls of Storm and Shadow (2019) # Girls of Fate and Fury (forthcoming 2021) === Standalone === * The Elites (2013) * The Memory Keepers (2014) == References == == External links == * Category:Living people Category:Writers from Hertfordshire Category:21st-century Malaysian writers Category:21st-century Chinese writers Category:1990 births Category:Women writers of young adult literature Category:British expatriates in Malaysia ","title":"Natasha Ngan"},{"id":"60273979","text":"The Church of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin Pyotr Potapov (, also written as Peter Potapov), is the hypothetical architect of the Church of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin on Pokrovka.

His literary work made him a leading figure in the circles of the Russian-Jewish intelligentsia. Originally a vocal proponent of the assimilation of Jews into Russian culture, Levanda became a strong supporter of their emigration to Palestine following the 1881–82 pogroms across the Russian Empire. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Lev Levanda was born to a poor Jewish family in Minsk, Byelorussia. After spending three years at a state-sponsored school for Jews in his hometown, he entered the Vilna Rabbinical School in 1849, graduating in 1854 with a teacher's diploma. He thereafter returned to Minsk and was appointed a teacher at the government-run Jewish school. He taught there until 1860, when he was appointed adviser on Jewish affairs (uchonyi evrei) to the Governor-General of Vilna, Mikhail N. Muravyov, a position he held until his death. In this role he assisted with programs to study Jewish life and edited Russian-language state textbooks for Jewish children. Levanda was instrumental in exposing false witnesses in a ritual-murder trial of several Jews from the shtetl of Shavl in 1861. ===Vienna=== Upon his arrival in Vilna, Levanda participated in the publication of the first Russian-language Jewish journal, ' ('Dawn'), edited in Odessa by Osip Rabinovich, as well as its successor, Zion. His first novel, Shop of Imported Far-East Groceries, appeared in the pages of Rassvet in 1860. Levanda's The Warehouse of Groceries: Pictures of the Jewish Life, a work of belles lettres, was serialized in Rassvet, and published as a book in 1869 (a Hebrew translation was published five years later). A supporter of the Russification of Eastern European Jewry, in 1864 Levanda was appointed editor of the region's official newspaper, Vilenskie gubernskie vedomosti ('Vilna Provincial News'), with a mandate to justify Muravyov's russifying campaign. Following the banning of Rassvet and Zion, he began to contribute under a pseudonym to a number of liberal Russian newspapers in St. Petersburg and Vilna, including the Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti. In a series of articles, Levanda argued that the acquisition of civil rights hinged on the assimilation of the Jewish masses into Russian culture. In the 1870s and 1880s, he contributed to the Russian Jewish journals ' (Еврейская библиотека, 'Jewish Library'), ' ('Russian Jew'), and Voskhod ('Sunrise'). In 1876 he published a collection of sketches under the title \\"Ocherki Proshlavo,\\" followed later by a number of stories, such as \\"Chetyre Guvernera,\\" \\"Lyubitelski Spektakl,\\" and \\"Iz Dobravo Staravo Vryemeni,\\" in Russkii evrei, Yevreiskoe Obozrenie, and Voskhod. He published over twenty articles on Jewish life in Poland with the title \\"Privislianskaia khronika\\" in Russkii evrei. Other works of this period include \\"Essays of the Past\\" (1875), originally published in 1870 in '; \\"Tipy i Siluety\\" ('Types and Silhouettes', 1881); and the historical novels The Wrath and Mercy of the Tycoon (1885) and Avraam Yosefovich (1887). He published his best-known work, Goriachee vremia ('Seething Times'), set in the northern Pale of Settlement against the background of the Polish Uprising of 1863, in three instalments between 1871 and 1873 in Evreiskaia bibliotek. In the novel, young Westernized Jews were urged by the hero, Sarin, to abandon Polish orientation (after 500 years of unhappy experience with the Poles) and become Russians. The book was released as a book in 1875 under the title Goriachee vremia: Roman iz poslednego pol'skogo vosstaniia ('Seething Times: The Novel of the Last Polish Uprising'). ===Final years=== Levanda's political views changed dramatically following the 1881–82 pogroms across the Russian Empire, and the Russian state's hostile indifference to them. With the subsequent rapid growth in Polish anti-Semitism, Levanda began writing about the rebuilding of a Jewish state in Palestine. He became a leading activist for the Hibbat Zion movement and maintained close links with Leon Pinsker, author of the influential Zionist manifesto Auto-Emancipation. In \\"The Essence of the So-Called 'Palestine' Movement\\" (1884), Levanda discussed the ideas of Jewish self-determination as a \\"practical solution\\" to a \\"vicious cycle,\\" and in 1885 published an important reconsideration of the position of the Jews in Russia, entitled \\"On 'Assimilation'\\". At the end of 1886, he first showed signs of a mental disorder—exacerbated by rumours of an imminent pogrom in the nearby town of Maladzyechna—as a result of which Levanda ceased his writing activities. In early 1887, his condition began to deteriorate sharply, showing signs of major depressive disorder; as a result, in May 1887, he was transported to St. Petersburg, but first refused to leave the house and was placed in a St. Petersburg psychiatric hospital only after his friend Isaac Leib Goldberg promised to take him to Palestine. He died in hospital less than a year later. ==References== Category:19th-century Russian novelists Category:1835 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Imperial Russian novelists Category:Jewish educators Category:Jewish Russian writers Category:Lithuanian Jews Category:Writers from Minsk Category:Russian historical novelists Category:Russian male novelists Category:Russian nationalists Category:Russian Zionists Category:Vilna Rabbinical School alumni Category:Writers from Vilnius Category:Yiddish-language writers ","title":"Lev Levanda"},{"id":"60274061","text":"Events from 2020 in England ==Incumbents== *Monarch – Elizabeth II == Events == === January === *9 January – Five members of prison staff are injured when they are attacked by two inmates at Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire; the Metropolitan Police subsequently announces that the incident is being treated as a terrorist incident. *10 January – Gemma Watts, a 21-year-old woman from Enfield, north London who disguised herself as a 16-year-old boy to sexually assault teenage girls she had groomed online, is sentenced to eight years imprisonment after pleading guilty at Winchester Crown Court to charges involving four girls.

He received the Tennessee History Book Award in 1991 for his first book, The History of Belle Meade: Mansion, Plantation and Stud. He is a past president of the Tennessee Historical Society and in 2016, was given an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from The University of the South. He is a former executive of a company founded by his grandfather, the National Life and Accident Insurance Company and was on the boards of trust of Vanderbilt University and Montgomery Bell Academy, a prep school for boys in Nashville. ==Family history== Wills' grandfather was businessman William Ridley Wills, one of the founders of the National Life and Accident Insurance Company in Nashville in 1902. In 1925, the company launched radio station WSM on the fifth floor of its building and created the country music broadcast, the Grand Ole Opry. The grandfather built a home in Nashville called \\"Far Hills\\", which, after his death in 1949, became the permanent residence for the Governor of Tennessee. Wills' father, Jesse Ely Wills, was a graduate from Vanderbilt University, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1922. While a student there, Jesse Wills and his older cousin, William Ridley Wills (who had the identical name of Jesse's father), were members of \\"The Fugitives\\", a literary movement of the 1920s that included Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom, Donald Davidson and Cleanth Brooks. Jesse Wills' sonnets were published in the poetry magazine, The Fugitive in 1923. Jesse Wills became board chairman of the National Life and Accident Insurance Company. He helped establish the \\"Fugitive Room\\" as a depository for Fugitive papers and manuscripts as part of a wing of Vanderbilt's Joint University Libraries building. Ridley Wills II's mother was Ellen McClung Buckner. His maternal grandmother was Elizabeth Buckner, the granddaughter of Gen. William Giles Harding. Wills married Irene Weaver Jackson in 1962. ==Career== Ridley Wills II went to work for the family firm, National Life, after graduating from Vanderbilt in 1956. He had worked his way up to senior vice president by the time the firm was taken over by American General Life and Accident Insurance Company in 1982. At that point, Wills said, \\"the culture changed, and they began doing things differently.\\" He added, \\"I decided to leave, but I was only 49 years old. I had to figure out what to do next, so I decided I'd raise money for organizations I cared about, serve on their boards, and start writing books.\\" As of 2020, he has written 27 books, primarily histories and biographies relating to the city of Nashville. Wills served on the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust and was board chair of Montgomery Bell Academy for nine years. He is a past president and trustee for the Tennessee Historical Society and in 1991 received the Tennessee History Book Award given by the Tennessee Library Association for his work, The History of Belle Meade: Mansion, Plantation and Stud.

From 1903 to 1905, he worked as a gold miner in West Africa, but he then returned to Cheshire. He became the chair of the Crewe Labour Party and also of the town's trades council. In 1908, he was elected to Crewe Town Council, serving until 1917. He was also chair of the Railway Workers' Joint Trade Movement. During World War I, Williams served on the Cheshire Appeal Tribunal, and in 1917 he became the full-time Lancashire District Organiser of the National Union of General Workers, working closely with J. R. Clynes. Although this entailed moving to Manchester, he was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Northwich at the 1918 United Kingdom general election.

He was ordained as a priest in 1938. He studied theology at Keizersberg Abbey (French Mont César) near Leuven, Belgium, where the Liturgical Movement began. Among his teachers were Bernard Capelle (1884–1961) and Bernard Botte (1893–1980). Nocent entered military service before his ordination and later during the Second World War when he served in a military hospital and later a military chaplain. Beginning in 1952, Nocent lectured at the Centre international Lumen Vitae in Brussels. He continued his studies at Louvain University and in Paris at the École pratique des hautes études. He finished his degree there in 1959 with a thesis under the direction of Gabriel Le Bras (1891–1970) and titled Un Fragment de sacramentaire de Sens au Xe siècle. La liturgie baptismale de la province ecclésiastique de Sens dans les manuscrits du IXe au XVIe siècles.Published in: Miscellanea liturgica in onore di S.E. il cardinale Giacomo Lercaro. Vol. 2. Rome–Paris–Tournai 1967, p. 649–794). He then went to Rome to teach at the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm. Together with Salvatore Marsili (1910–1983) Cipriano Vaggagini (1909–1999), and Emmanuel Lane, he founded the Pontifical Liturgical Institute. Nocent became a consultant to the Second Vatican Council in 1964 and in 1969, consultant to the Congregation for Divine Worship. In 1983, he co-founded the liturgical periodical Ecclesia orans with Anscar Chupungco. For decades, Nocent was a sought-after speaker on the topic of post-conciliar liturgical reform. He spoke in Italy, Canada, the United States, Cameroon, Senegal and Togo. Many bishops considered him to be an eminent specialist in his field. Nocent was an amateur violinist and Vice President of the Arthur Grumiaux Foundation. == Works == In his works, Nocent approached the New Testament from the standpoint of sin and reconciliation. For instance, he identified three different interpretations of classical passages in Matthew that are related to the liturgy and the sacrament of penance: juridical, ecclesiological, and demonological. He explained how the juridical interpretation, which holds that the supreme and universal power over sin in the church has been given to Peter and to the apostolic college, is no longer accepted. Nocent also opposed the moderate and balanced position of the Vatican Council. In a book called L'avenir de la liturgie published in 1961, he criticized the mentality that permeated after the Sacrosanctum Concilium. This involved what he called as attitude that favored iconoclasm and the burning of old idols. Nocent described it as too impatient and based on a view that confused idle routine with legitimate tradition. During the Second Vatican Council, he was a member of the committee for the revision of the Lectionary. In this capacity, he participated in the move for the massive introduction of Scripture in the missal, citing that it constituted a renewal in the Church's liturgical reform. His position on liturgical movement has also been described as \\"validism\\", which holds that what matters is not that the liturgical ceremonies have meaning or the sacraments express grace which they signify. For Nocent, all that matters is for the sacraments to be valid, for the formulas to be correct, and for the gestures to be rubrically exact. This, for him makes worship mechanically efficient, resulting to less trouble for worshippers receiving grace. The position aimed to address the interior and subjective worship. == Books == *Contempler sa gloire. 3 vols. Paris 1960–1965. **(German) Das heilige Jahr. 3 vols.

Originally developed as a feature film adaptation, the idea was re- imagined as a television series for Netflix when the service had given the production a series order for a first season. Filming takes place in multiple locations in Andalusia Spain, such as Antequera, where the headquarters of the fictional Order of the Cruciform Sword was filmed. The series is narrated and led by Portuguese actress Alba Baptista in the role of Ava Silva, a quadriplegic orphan who discovers she now has supernatural powers which force her to join an ancient order of warrior nuns. The series marks Baptista's English-language debut. The cast also features Toya Turner, Thekla Reuten, Lorena Andrea, Kristina Tonteri-Young and Tristan Ulloa. The series debuted on July 2, 2020 on Netflix, to generally positive reviews. In August 2020, the series has been renewed for a second season. ==Premise== Warrior Nun revolves around the story of a 19-year-old woman who wakes up in a morgue with a new lease on life and a divine artifact embedded in her back. She discovers she is now part of the ancient Order of the Cruciform Sword that has been tasked with fighting demons on Earth, and powerful forces representing both heaven and hell want to find and control her. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Alba Baptista as Ava Silva * Toya Turner as Sister Mary / Shotgun Mary * Thekla Reuten as Jillian Salvius * Lorena Andrea as Sister Lilith * Kristina Tonteri- Young as Sister Beatrice * Tristan Ulloa as Father Vincent * Olivia Delcán as Sister Camila ===Recurring=== * Joaquim de Almeida as Cardinal Francisco Duretti * Peter de Jersey as Kristian Schaefer * Lope Haydn Evans as Michael Salvius * Sylvia De Fanti as Mother Superion * Emilio Sakraya as JC * May Simón Lifschitz as Chanel * Dimitri Abold as Randall * Charlotte Vega as Zori * Guiomar Alonso as Areala de Cordoue * William Miller as Adriel ===Guest=== * Melina Matthews as Sister Shannon Masters * Frances Tomelty as Sister Frances * Fred Pritchard as Diego * Alberto Ruano as Mateo * Sinead MacInnes as Sister Crimson ==Production== ===Development=== On September 28, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Simon Barry was set to serve as showrunner for the series. Barry is also credited as an executive producer alongside Stephen Hegyes with Terri Hughes Burton serving as a co-executive producer for the series. Production companies involved with the series are Barry's Reality Distortion Field and Fresco Film Services. The series premiered on July 2, 2020. On August 19, 2020, Netflix renewed the series for a second season. ===Casting=== Sometime after the series order announcement, it was confirmed that Alba Baptista, Toya Turner, Tristan Ulloa, Thekla Reuten, Kristina Tonteri-Young, Lorena Andrea, and Emilio Sakraya would star in the series. On April 1, 2019, it was announced that Sylvia De Fanti had joined the cast as a series regular. ===Filming=== Filming for the first season took place on location of Andalusia (Spain), in the town of Antequera (where the headquarters of the Order of the Cruciform Sword is located) Marbella, Ronda, Málaga, and Sevilla, from March 11, 2019 to July 5, 2019. The El Tajo Gorge was featured in one of the scenes. ==Episodes== ==Release== On June 17, 2020, Netflix released the official trailer for the series, and the first season was released on July 2, 2020. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 70% based on 33 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Though Warrior Nun heavy handed set-up weighs it down, committed performances and excellent fight choreography may be enough for those looking for more pulp with their pulpit.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roxana Hadadi of The A. V. Club wrote: \\"The script can sometimes lean too much on mythological and religious exposition... but the actors have such good chemistry that their various pairings work, and the smartly choreographed fight scenes are well-placed.\\" Hadadi said that \\"Warrior Nun is undoubtedly familiar\\" influenced by the likes of Veronica Mars, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Alex Garland's Devs, but that when the show really clicks it becomes \\"its own distinct experience rather than simply a derivative facsimile of those inspirations.\\" She praised the performances, particularly Toya Turner as Shotgun Mary, and gives the show a grade B-. Nicole Drum of ComicBook.com gave the review 3 out of 5, and wrote: \\"Warrior Nun is a truly wild journey that manages to ask some tough questions while equally embracing its silliness, its action, and the absolute absurdity of it all. The show may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is one hell of a fun ride.\\" While the majority of critics praised the choreography of the series, many took issue with the pacing of the plot and the extensive exposition of the plot. Robyn Bahr, of The Hollywood Reporter notes, \\"Thematically, Warrior Nun is nothing you haven't seen before, and aesthetically, nothing you ever want to see again...leak, dour and trudging, the series contains none of the kitschy, blasphemous fun of its title.\\" Critic Steve Murray notes that Warrior Nun has \\"both potential and problems in equal measure\\"; supposing that the series is trying to recreate the feel of Buffy the Vampire Slayer but with less witty dialogue and creativity. Reviewer Danielle Broadway of BlackGirlNerds states that, although the program has good intentions, Warrior Nun \\"fails to live up to expectations\\". Broadway says the elements of a good series are there, but \\"if the plot, pacing, and character development (don't improve), there will be no resurrection for Season 2\\". ==ReferencesCategory:2020s American drama television series Category:2020s American supernatural television series Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:American fantasy drama television series Category:American action television series Category:Dark fantasy television series Category:Martial arts television series Category:Angels in television Category:Demons in television Category:Nuns in fiction Category:English-language television shows Category:English-language Netflix original programming Category:Television shows based on comics Category:Television series about orphans Category:Television about magic Category:Television shows filmed in Spain Category:Television shows set in Spain Category:Television shows set in Andalusia Category:Television shows set in Vatican City ","title":"Warrior Nun (TV series)"},{"id":"60274447","text":"Hugo Leal Melo da Silva (born 6 August 1962) more commonly known as Hugo Leal is a Brazilian politician as well as a syndicalist and trade union president.

He fought a duel with an opposing Whig agent. ==Early life== Levinz was the eldest son of Sir Creswell Levinz of Evenley, Northamptonshire, a prominent lawyer, and his wife Elizabeth Livesay, daughter of William Livesay of Lancashire. His uncle William Levinz was professor of Greek at Oxford, and another uncle Baptist Levinz was Bishop of Sodor and Man. He was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1681 and matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, where his uncle William Levinz was president, on 26 August 1688, aged 17. In 1689, he transferred to Inner Temple and in 1693 he was called to the bar. He married Ann Buck, daughter of Samuel Buck of Gray's Inn on 4 June 1693. He succeeded his father in 1701 to his estates. one of which carried with it an electoral interest at Retford. ==Career== Levinz became one of the leaders of the Tories Nottinghamshire. He stood as a Tory for East Retford at the second general election of 1701 but was defeated and his petition was dismissed. At the 1702 English general election he was defeated again but this time his petition prevailed and he was returned as Member of Parliament for East Retford on 28 November 1702. He was a very active member and was a teller on several occasions in Parliament. At the 1705 English general election, he was returned again for East Retford, but was unseated on petition on 17 January 1706. He was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for the year 1707 to 1708. He was returned again as MP for East Retford at the 1708 British general election, when the Whig forces were divided over the ravages of the deer in Sherwood Forest. He fought a duel on 14 January 1709 with William Jessop, legal adviser and election manager to John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, in which Jessop was wounded. Levinz voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election he stood for Nottinghamshire where he was successfully returned. He was busy again in Parliament and was listed as a ‘worthy patriot’ who had helped to detect the mismanagements of the previous ministry. In 1712 he was elected a Commissioner to inquire into crown grants. He presented an address from Nottinghamshire in favour of the peace in August 1712, and he voted against the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. At the 1713 British general election he was returned unopposed for Nottinghamshire. He supported the government but demonstrated his Hanoverian loyalty when it was said in August 1715 that he was ‘as zealous to put the laws in execution against Roman Catholics as anybody’. Levinz was returned unopposed at the 1715 British general election. He contributed £100 towards the cost of raising a Nottinghamshire regiment in the 1715 Jacobite rebellion. He was defeated in a close contest at the 1722 British general election of which he wrote ‘the methods of menaces and promises have been so extravagant and the corruption so open and avowed’. In 1727 he threatened to join Sir Robert Clifton in contesting both East Retford and Nottinghamshire, with influential Whig support, but in the end he made an agreement with the local Whig leaders not to stand himself for the county if they would not oppose his nominee at East Retford. In 1732, both the Whig Members for Nottinghamshire vacated their seats at the same time, and Levinz compromised again. He was returned for one of the vacancies and a Whig candidate for the other at the by-election on 30 May 1732. Levinz’ son William came of age in 1734 and at the 1734 Levinz made an agreement with the Whigs so that his son was returned at Nottinghamshire in his place. ==Death and legacy== Levinz died in May 1747 leaving a son and two daughters. ==References== Category:1670s births Category:1747 deaths Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Alumni of St John's College, Oxford Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1708–1710 Category:British MPs 1710–1713 Category:British MPs 1713–1715 Category:British MPs 1715–1722 Category:British MPs 1727–1734 ","title":"William Levinz (MP)"},{"id":"60274557","text":"The Georgetown Herald was a weekly newspaper published in Georgetown, Ontario from 1867 to 1992. ==History== Isaac Hunter, the son of John Hunter, Postmaster of nearby Ashgrove, established the newspaper in 1866. Isaac launched the paper for the 1400 strong village on May 3, 1866 after dissolving his 18 month partnership with Robert Matheson, the two having worked on the Canadian Champion and County of Halton Intelligencer. This was not an amicable split, with the Herald attacking the Reform politics of the Champion in its early days, until financier of the Herald William Barber stepped in. Isaac had launched the paper as one aligned with Colonel George King Chisholm and the Conservatives, the Colonel being the son of Oakville’s founder, its first mayor, and recently elected to the seat for County of Halton. It was not the first newspaper founded in Georgetown and not without its own share of troubles. During the first three decades, the paper passed through a number of different editors/proprietors, including Mr. Hunter until 1869, Joseph & Richard Craig, Nelson Burns (1871), Thomas Starret (1874), and two of its longer overseers, Robert D. Warren for fifteen years (1876) and Walter Biehn for thirty-three (1940), before he sold it to the Thompson Newspaper Chain. A fire in 1871 did only minor damage to the paper’s offices, though destroyed much of Main Street. In April 1918 the Herald could not escape another fire, which gutted the offices destroying its records and presses, the press itself crashing through the top floor into the basement. Thanks to their connection to the Acton Free Press and editor Henry P. Moore they did not miss an issue. The paper itself was four pages, printed on one side, with a Thursday morning publishing originally before moving to Wednesdays. An annual subscription was $1 pre-1916, $1.50 afterwards, up to $7.50 by the 1970s. Being a paper-making town, the early advertisements concerned the mills and their products, such as the Barber brothers’ industries. Local news was refer to as “Local Intelligence” and County Council proceedings would be transcribed with crowd reactions, or an advertisement for a marriage license by the paper’s founder, Isaac Hunter. The paper’s acquisition in 1886 by Robert D. Warren saw it move to 103 Main Street South in 1890 to share a building with the Georgetown branch of the Bank of Hamilton. Warren had been born near Acton on April 28th, 1863, an active member of the Baptist denomination. He married Clara E. Bessey of Esquesing Township in 1901, and before his career as a publisher had been a schoolteacher and clerk. During his life he served as Warden of Halton County and Reeve for Georgetown. He also operated Herald Steam Printing House, which opened in 1888. Aside from the Herald, Warren bought out the Halton Conservator, which ran from 1901 until 1906. Joseph M. Moore, likely connected to the Moores of the Acton Free Press, became foreman in 1891, bringing in a linotype machine in 1928, and partner and owner until his passing in 1939. Walter Biehn (1915-2005) owned the paper starting in 1940, through the 50s and 60s, with his wife Mary writing the local events column, “Chatting”. Mary ran the business while Walter fought in the Second World War. Walter also found time to be a town councillor, Chairman of Georgetown Board of Education, and Lion’s Club member. The paper came to an end after the February 19th, 1992 edition, with publisher Robert Malcomson and editor Colin Gibson at the helm. After 125 years of serving the Halton Hills communities, the Thompson Newspapers chain cited “poor financial result and limited prospect for improvement” as reason why. ==See also== *List of newspapers in Canada ==References== ==External links== *The Georgetown Herald (1867-1982) - INK/ODW Newspaper archive Category:Weekly newspapers published in Ontario Category:Publications established in 1867 Category:1992 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Publications disestablished in 1992 Category:Defunct newspapers published in Ontario Category:1867 establishments in Ontario Category:Defunct weekly newspapers ","title":"The Georgetown Herald"},{"id":"60274568","text":"Robert Lee Hess (December 18, 1932 – January 12, 1992) was an American scholar of African history, and the sixth President of Brooklyn College. ==Personal life== Hess was born in Asbury Park, New Jersey, to Henry and Ada (Davis) Hess.

She organized a group of insurgent women, the pétroleuses, who burned plantations and called on citizens to face local authority to free an unjustly convicted black sailor. == Early life == Lumina was born in 1848, the year slavery was abolished in Martinique, in Rivière-Pilote, a small island town, daughter of a former enslaved woman, recently liberated by abolition, Marie-Sophie, known as Zulma. At a time when slaves were illiterate, Lumina had access to education and literature, reading newspapers and becoming interested in French politics on the island. She was registered under the name of Marie-Philomène Sophie. Later, the administration would give the mother and daughter the surname of Roptus. Thus, Marie-Philomène Sophie became Marie-Philomène Roptus, but everyone calls her Lumina (diminutive of Philomène) Sophie (of her mother's name). According to the records, her mother was already the head of the family when Lumina was only 6 years old. Her family is basically composed by women like grandmother, aunts, cousins and nieces. They lived in a lease where they grew bananas, cocoa and coffee, where men worked in the fields and women took care of the household, children, sewing and cooking. With the death of the grandmother, the family scattered. Installed in another lease, Lumina helped the mother in the harvest, learned to sew, went with her to the market, and proved quite precocious for politics. While working on crops, she saw the precarious way of life of most workersIn 1870, Lumina was 21 years old and was already an independent, strong-willed young girl, often seen in the village markets and the town of Rivière Pilote. Around this time , she met Emile Sidney, the son of a liberated family before slavery, which keeps her informed about the daily lives of the rural population, abusive taxes, contempt and lack of access to education. == The revolt == In 1870, Leopold Lubin, a black sailor, a member of a family of bricklayers, had a violent argument with Augier Maintenon, a young European, assistant commissar of the French Navy and chief of the town's naval service. The case was brought to court and Leopold was convicted of libel and assault, which the population soon saw as a case involving racism. In solidarity, a movement led by Lumina rises, where she petitions and raises money to pay the costs of Leopold's defense. Racist provocations are made by members of the local trade, including one of them who was in Leopold's jury and is proud to have condemned him. This was not the first case of injustices perpetrated by the island's justice system. White flags (a nostalgic symbol of royalty and white supremacy) were hoisted in the streets in provocation and a farmer accused of raping an ex-slave and abandoning his body was convicted with only a fine. Angered by the constant provocations, the rural workers are organized around Lumina. In September of 1870, in Rivière Pilote's market, Lumina met with the other demonstrators, shouting for the liberation of Lubin. On September 22, the population of southern Martinique and especially that of Rivière Pilote exploded in revolt with Lumina as one of the insurgents. She was in her second month of pregnancy and marched toward the public jail with the crowd behind her. In the ensuing chaos, Emile and several other men of the movement disappeared or were found dead. Lumina took the fight but the revolt was quickly defeated; she was captured on September 26, 1870 and sent to Fort Desaix. == Prison and death == Several charges of insurrection and revolt were made against Lumina, whom the governor of Martinique called \\"the fiercest, the most fearsome of the hooligan gang leaders.\\" Her first trial was from March 17 to April 17, 1871. She is presented as a woman seeking to \\"dominate men.\\" The governor identifies her as the \\"flame of revolt\\" and she was sentenced to life imprisonment in Saint- Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana. Her judgment was not fair, for it was all done in French, and she spoke only Creole. His son, Théodore Lumina, was born in prison and was separated from his mother at birth, dying about seven months later. In 1877, Lumina was forced to marry a former prisoner and farmer from French Guiana, 14 years her senior, and Lumina died two years later from illness and ill-treatment, in September 15 1879. == Legacy == In 2005, the French playwright wrote a play staged in France and in its territories on the life of Lumina and its history has been remembered by local artists. A high school in Martinique was named after her. In 2008, a biography written by Gilbert Pago collected facts and dates about her life and struggle. == See also == * Haitian Revolution == References == Category:1879 deaths Category:1848 births Category:History of Martinique Category:Pages with unreviewed translations ","title":"Lumina Sophie"},{"id":"60274634","text":"Natacha Valla (born January 1, 1976) is a French economist and Dean of the Sciences Po School of Management and Innovation.
