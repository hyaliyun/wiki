She was First Lady of Colorado during her husband Richard Lamm's three terms as Governor of Colorado (1975–1987), and unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate as the Colorado Democratic candidate in 1998. She wrote a weekly column for The Denver Post from 1979 to 1996 and later published three books. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. ==Early life and education== Dorothy Louise Vennard was born in New York City in 1937. She has one sister. She grew up in Palo Alto, California, where her father worked as a civil engineer. She earned a BA at Occidental College in Los Angeles. After college, she began working out of Denver as a stewardess for United Airlines. She met Richard Lamm at a party in 1959; they married in 1963. She then began working as a psychiatric social worker. In 1967 Lamm earned her Master of Social Work at the University of Denver. ==Political career== ===First Lady of Colorado, 1975–1987 === Lamm was the First Lady of Colorado during her husband's three terms as governor from 1975 to 1987. She used her position as a platform to advance issues such as reproductive rights, equal pay for equal work, and child care. From 1976 to 1977 she chaired the Governor's Task Force on Children and served as a member of the Colorado Commission on Women. After a women's magazine published excerpts from the journal she had kept during her husband's gubernatorial campaign, she proposed a weekly column for The Denver Post. Her column, in which she discussed her personal life and aired her political, social, and feminist views, ran from 1979 to 1996. ===Political appointee=== President Bill Clinton named Lamm as a member of the official United States delegation to the 1994 United Nations Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo. Clinton also named her as a delegate to the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995. ===1998 campaign for United States Senate=== In 1997 Lamm declared her intention to run for United States Senator from Colorado on the Democratic ticket. Her opponent would be Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who had won the Senate seat as a Democrat in 1992 (defeating Richard Lamm for the Democratic party nomination), but who had changed his party affiliation to Republican in 1995. She won the Democratic state primary in August with 57 percent of the vote, to 43 percent garnered by State Representative Gil Romero. Lamm's campaign called for improvements in the state's fiscal, educational, and environmental policies in order to benefit children. The Washington Post wrote: > Lamm held up a thick stack of papers at debates, calling it Campbell's book > of missed votes. She blasted Campbell for conflicting votes on issues > including abortion, corporate tax breaks and gay rights. [Richard] Lamm, who > lost the 1992 Democratic primary to Campbell, hired a gymnast named \\"Flip- > horse\\" in September to perform back hand springs at campaign stops. Lamm raised $1.64 million for her campaign, which included revenue from fundraisers that she held with Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Clinton. Campbell raised $2.9 million and received endorsements from former president George H. W. Bush and 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole. In the November election, Campbell garnered 62 percent of the vote, compared to 35 percent for Lamm. ==Other activities== In 1999 Lamm began teaching at the University of Denver as the 1999/2000 Leo Block Fellow, giving courses on population, leadership, and risk-taking. She then became an adjunct professor in the Community Track at the university's graduate school of social work, giving courses on community organization and political advocacy. She retired from teaching in 2006. In recent years, Lamm has volunteered in a program for Somali immigrant children, and mentors young women considering careers in politics. ==Affiliations and memberships== Lamm is a founder of the Women's Foundation of Colorado, and was the group's first board president. She is also a founder of the Democratic Women's Caucus of Colorado. As of 2014, she was a member of the foundation board of the Rocky Mountain Farmers' Union, and the Capital Campaign Committee for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. ==Awards and honors== She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. The Women's Foundation of Colorado named its annual Dottie Lamm Leadership Award for high school students in her honor. She was the recipient of the 2014 Empathy Award from Volunteers of America. ==Personal life== She married Richard Lamm, then a lawyer and accountant, in Denver in 1963. They have a son and daughter. Both she and her husband enjoy scuba diving, skiing, and mountain climbing. She has climbed 35 of the fourteeners in Colorado. In August 1983 Lamm was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. She wrote about her surgery and chemotherapy treatment at length in her newspaper column, encouraging women to go for mammogram screening, and received many letters of support. ==Bibliography== * * * ==References== ==Sources== * ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Listing of Dottie Lamm columns for The Denver Post Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Colorado Democrats Category:Writers from Denver Category:University of Denver alumni Category:University of Denver faculty Category:Occidental College alumni Category:Writers from New York City Category:Writers from Palo Alto, California ","title":"Dottie Lamm"},{"id":"56704332","text":"Lee Roy Abernathy (1913–1993) was a Southern gospel music musician, songwriter, and performer. ==Biography== Abernathy was born on August 13, 1913, in the Atco community of Cartersville, Bartow County, Georgia. He married Louise Ammons, and they had three children, Hugh, Linda, and Susan. ==Music== Abernathy's first musical experience came with his father’s group, the Atco Quartet, at the age of five. His parents instilled a love for quartet music and the tradition of gospel singing conventions, where he learned to read shape notes. He was able to sing harmony with the quartet while standing on a Coca-Cola crate. He studied music under James D. Vaughan, J. M. Henson, and Adger M. Pace. In the 1930s, he founded the Modern Mountaineers, performing live on Atlanta's WSB (AM). In 1936, he wrote \\"Good Times Are Coming Soon,\\" a reelection campaign song for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He wrote many gospel songs, including \\"He’s A Personal Savior\\", \\"A Newborn Feeling\\", and \\"I Thank My Savior for It All\\", but his signature song was \\"A Wonderful Time Up There\\". Some pastors objected to its jazz beat, which influenced the early career of Elvis Presley. Abernathy disregarded the criticism, believing that he had written the song as a result of divine inspiration. The song was later called the \\"Gospel Boogie\\" and was recorded by numerous quartets, as well as Johnny Cash, Johnny Mathis, and Pat Boone. Boone's recording of the song reached number four on the Billboard charts in 1958. Abernathy wrote \\"Burning of the Winecoff Hotel\\" following the tragic Winecoff Hotel fire in Atlanta in 1946. He was a frequent guest of the hotel and would have been at the hotel on the night of the fire, but had gone home when a friend gave him a gasoline ration stamp. Abernathy became the pianist for the Homeland Harmony Quartet in 1947. He also performed with the Rangers Quartet, Jubilee Quartet, Miracle Men, Happy Two, and Abernathy All Star Quartet. Happy Two appeared on WAGA-TV television in Atlanta beginning in 1951 and continued for seven years. ==Political life== Abernathy launched a campaign for Georgia governor in 1958. He finished a distant third in the Democratic party primary behind William Bodenhamer and the eventual winner, Ernest Vandiver. ==Death and legacy== Abernathy continued to teach piano and voice lessons until his death on May 25, 1993. He was buried at Cherokee Memorial Park in Canton, Georgia. He is a member of the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame. In 1989 he received the Mary Tallent Pioneer Award from the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.

For example, anxiety is perceived as an emotion but if dysfunctional or debilitating, it may be considered a disorder (see anxiety disorder). From there, anxiety can be divided down into a plethora of categories such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and social anxiety. People with social anxiety tend to be shy, refrain from speaking up, lack self-esteem, and defer attention.Stein, M. B., & Gorman, J. M. (2001). Unmasking Social Anxiety Disorder. Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, 26(3), 185–189. If severe, social anxiety can be detrimental. Debilitating fears restrain some from performing everyday activities such as public speaking, test taking, or sexual intercourse (see social anxiety disorder). There are a number of evolutionary theories on how social anxiety may have developed, the most prominent of which is exclusion theory. == Biological adaptation to living in small groups == There is a suggestion that people have adapted to live with others in small groups. Living in a group is attractive as there are more people to provide labor, protection, and a concentration of potential mates.Baumeister, R., & Tice, D. (1990). Anxiety and Social Exclusion. Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 9(2).Buss, D. (1990). The Evolution of Anxiety and Social Exclusion. Journal Of Social And Clinical Psychology, 9(2), 196-201. Since much of evolutionary theory is concerned with reproduction, the benefit of exposure to potential mates within a group cannot be overemphasized. But first, one must gather enough resources to be of a certain status to attract a mate. Working together to gather these resources, is thus, is a major attraction. Any perceived threat to group resources would leave an individual on guard, as would any potential position of status that might bring conflict with others.Gilbert, P. (2001). Evolution and Social Anxiety: The Role of Attraction, Social Competition, and Social Hierarchies. Psychiatric Clinics, 24(4), 723-751. Finally, living in groups offers health benefits. === Resources === Resources have served as a symbolic form of one's status, allowing the individual to survive and acquire mates. Searching for resources as a collective group may have given access to a substantial amount of capital. Social anxiety might stem back to when people had to negotiate or defend their resources, thereby initiating some kind of 'alert'. Suppression of these negative reactions ultimately helps the individual avoid conflicts which might lead to lack of resources at their disposal, expulsion from the group, or even death. In effect, anxiety in this way is adaptive because it helps people understand what is socially acceptable and what is not. The threat of exclusion of resources could lead to death. === Mates === The aspect of a partnership will be covered in depth in the \\"sex, partnership, and familial relations\\" section. However, it is important to note how access to resources and compatibility within a group impacts an individual's mate selection. Due to the vulnerability of human mothers and babies after birth, a father had to protect both individuals. While they spent less time with the offspring, they were investing more time mastering the external environment for the safety and security of mother and child.Bögels, S. M., & Perotti, E. C. (2011). Does Father Know Best? A Formal Model of the Paternal Influence on Childhood Social Anxiety. Journal of Child and Family Studies, 20(2), 171-181. Fathers may be confronting external forces threatening resources or social status. Having resources to nourish mother and child attracts potential mates. Maintaining a harmonious relationship among the community helps to access those original resources. Without mates and other relationships to sustain and support an individual, the person faces potential exclusion and isolation. === Health benefits === At a basic level, being confined to a particular group of people limits exposure to certain diseases. Studies have suggested that social affiliation has an impact on health and the more integrated and accepted we are, the healthier we are.Wilkinson, R. G. (1999). Health, Hierarchy, and Social Anxiety. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 896(1), 48-63. == Theories on social anxiety == Buss- Social Anxiety may have developed from fearful temperament and either excessive socialization of a child to the point that they are hyperaware of inappropriate social situations or underdeveloped social skills.Buss, A. (1980). Self-consciousness and social anxiety. San Francisco: Freeman. Aron- Genetic inheritance of a high level of sensory- processing sensitivity.Aron, E. (1999). High sensitivity as one source of fearfulness and shyness. In J. Schulkin & L. A. Schmidt (Eds.), Extreme fear, shyness, and social phobia (pp. 251-272). New York: Oxford University Press. Seligman- prepared by evolutionary history to have anxiety (fear) towards objects and situations which were previously perceived as a threat by our early ancestors.Seligman, M. (1971). Phobias and preparedness. Behavior Therapy. 2, 307-320. Trower and Gilbert- social anxiety as a way to maintain cohesion in a society Trower, P. & Gilbert, P. (1989). New theoretical conceptions of social anxiety and social phobia. Clinical Psychology Review, 9, 19-35. Gilbert- Social anxiety triggered by competition (status and resources) Leary and Kowalski- fostering social inclusion and reducing the risk of exclusion/rejection Leary, M. R. & Kowalski, R. M. (1995). Social Anxiety. New York: Guilford. === Exclusion theory === One of the leading theories regarding social anxiety is exclusion theory. At its simplest, social anxiety might be regarded as a basic human need to 'fit' into a given social group. Someone might be excluded due to their inability to contribute to a group, deviance from group standards, or even unattractiveness. Based on the above section outlining the benefits of living in a group, an individual would want to avoid social isolation at any cost. Anxiety may serve as anticipation to an event that may lead to social exclusion. An example that has been put forth puts the mother-infant relationship into play. When an infant is put down and mother leaves, the infant cries out until the mother comes back. The theory put forth claims the infant ensures social inclusion by the mother's return.Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and Loss: Vol. 1. Attachment. New York: Basic Books.Bowlby, J. (1973). Attachment and Loss: Vol. 2. Separation Anxiety and Anger. New York: Basic Books. Another example offers a new perspective on the classic Oedipus Complex. The Oedipus Complex has traditionally referred to an inherent desire to kill one's father and sleep with their mother. This motivation is disbanded due to fears of castration. Perhaps a more practical interpretation of the Oedipus complex is an interpretation through exclusion theory. Instead, the infant fears being abandoned and excluded from the family. The same conclusion can be applied to children who wish to sleep with their parents at night; they fear social exclusion rather than a desire to be intimate with a parent. > \\"It is doubtful how often parents make explicit verbal threats of castration > to their children, but they do often make threats of leaving the child, > putting the child away somewhere, giving the child away to the police or > other strangers, and so forth.\\"Baumeister, R., & Tice, D. (1990). Anxiety > and Social Exclusion. Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 9(2), > 186-187. Ultimately anxiety as interpreted by exclusion theory emphasizes people's needs to be accepted by other people. Knowing what is and is not seen as attractive to the self and other individuals allows one to prevent rejection, criticisms, or exclusion from others. Indeed, there is a reason that adultery, mate poaching, and murder are prominent reasons for group exclusion, as they impact the fitness (reproductive and physical) of the group. == Sex, partnership, and familial relations == As referenced before, living in a group gives an individual access to resources and partners. Humans are physiologically sensitive to social cues and therefore detect changes in interactions which may indicate dissatisfaction or unpleasant reactions. People can enhance how others view them by wearing particular clothes, accomplishing academic achievements, playing a certain sport, etc. All of these variables are attributes of how attractive an individual is perceived. == Function, traits, and signals of anxiety == Overall, social anxiety may serve as a way for people to anticipate certain actions that might bring social exclusion. People with social anxiety might display characteristics of self-blaming and self-derogating, have high perceived social standards, poorly defined social goals, a heightened sense of self-focused attention and retreat from social situations to avoid social 'mishaps'.Hofmann, S. G. (2007). Cognitive factors that maintain social anxiety disorder: A comprehensive model and its treatment implications. Cognitive behaviour therapy, 36(4), 193-209. Eye gaze avoidance is another major trait, as it typically signals that the individual is not a threat.Bulley, A., Miloyan, B., Brilot, B., Gullo, M. J., & Suddendorf, T. (2016). An Evolutionary Perspective on the Co-occurrence of Social Anxiety Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder. Journal of Affective Disorders, 196, 62-70.Schneier, F. R., Rodebaugh, T. L., Blanco, C., Lewin, H., & Liebowitz, M. R. (2011). Fear and avoidance of eye contact in social anxiety disorder. Comprehensive Psychiatry, 52(1), 81-87.

The crime was a part of a Soviet forced settlement program and population transfer that affected several million members of non-Russian Soviet ethnic minorities between the 1930s and the 1950s. Officially the deportation was a response to the Balkars' supposed collaboration with occupying German forces. Later, in 1989, the Soviet government declared the deportation illegal. ==Historical background== In August 1942 five districts of the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (KBASSR) were occupied by German troops. Nalchik, capital of the KBASSR, was occupied on October24, 1942. When the Soviet military forces withdrew they failed to remove or destroy local factories. Most agricultural resources were also untouched; for example 315,000 sheep, 455,000 cattle and 25,000 horses were left for the advancing Germans. Local authorities attempted to organize several partisan groups, but, as the families of the partisans were not evacuated, these groups fall apart. Only one unit, consisting of 125 people was effective. In early 1943 the KBASSR was liberated by the Soviet Army. Nalchik was liberated by troops of the 37th army together with local partisans. Despite this, according to Soviet reports in May 1943 there were 44 groups of anti-Soviet rebels, 941 people, on KBASSR territory; these included former Communist Party members. == Causes of deportation == === Stalinism === It is believed that the reason for the deportation of the Balkars, in a broad sense, was the Stalinist system, which depended on the repression of the Soviet people. More specifically Kabarda and Balkaria had acquired a reputation for political unreliability during the repressions of the 1920-30s. During this period, from a Kabardino-Balkarian population of 359,236, 17,000 were arrested for political reasons, 9,547 of them were tried, and 2,184 shot. Repression continued during the prewar and war years. Many notable people were arrested and sentenced: H. Appaev — Chairman of the Chegemsky district Executive Committee, Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR; S. Chumakov — head of the CPSU, A. Mokaev — Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the KBASSR; A. Nastev — Chairman of the Elbrus District Administration, Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. All of them were rehabilitated in the 1950s and 1960s. === Accusations of betrayal === Head of the NKVD Beria saw only \\"a small contribution\\" from the Balkar people in the fight against the Nazis, and even a \\"betrayal\\" amounting to a \\"failure to protect Balkar Republic, Elbrus\\". Z. D. Kumekhov, an ethnic Kabardinian and First Secretary of Communist Party's Local Committee, sent \\"a report with descriptions of the current situation in Balkar's areas of the KBASSR\\". It is believed that it was prepared for him by the NKVD. The paper contained detailed descriptions of the activities of gangs in the KBASSR including collaboration with German troops. Supposedly assisting the Soviet Army, many groups attacked local civilians and farmers. The NKVD reported that there were 1,737 people in these gangs. Kumekhov's report ended with the words \\"Based on the above, we find it necessary to resolve the issue of the possibility of resettlement of the Balkars outside the KBASSR.\\" In a top- secret telegram to Stalin, Beria described the necessity of deportation is proved as follows:According to P. M. Polyan deportations, including that of the Balkars, were not preventive actions, but \\"revenge\\" for real or imagined war crimes against the Soviet Union. ==Deportation== Lavrentiy Beria arrived in Nalchik on 2 March 1944. In the early morning of March 8, 1944, two days earlier than planned, Balkar's population was ordered to get ready to leave their homes. The entire operation lasted about two hours. The entire Balkar population was evicted without exception. 17,000 NKVD troops and 4,000 local agents participated in this operation. By 9 March, 37,713 Balkars were deported in 14 train convoys. They arrived at their destinations in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic by 23 March. After the end of World War II, Karachai and Balkar officers of the Red Army were discharged and later also deported. Official Soviet documents reveal that 562 people died during the deportation. Many more died during the harsh years in exile and in labor camps. In total, it is estimated that 7,600 Balkars died as a consequence of the deportation, amounting to 19.82 percent of their entire ethnic group. == Remembrance and legacy == Victims of Deportation Memorial, Nalchik, KBR, Russia Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, delivered a secret speech at the Party Congress on February 24, 1956, condemning these Stalinist deportations. Like the other rehabilitated people, the Balkars were then allowed to return from exile to their homeland. They found their homes and farms pillaged and in ruins. While 64 million roubles were allocated to assist the Balkars in rebuilding their housing, they were never given full financial compensation for their lost property or suffering in exile. The 1959 Soviet census counted 42,408 Balkars. This is a population 10,000 below what was expected before the deportation. Some Balkars maintain that their status of autonomy is still not resolved. ==See also== *Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush *Deportation of the Crimean Tatars ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1944 in the Soviet Union Category:Ethnic cleansing in Europe Category:Forced migration in the Soviet Union Category:Political repression in the Soviet Union Category:Russian special forces operations Category:Mass murder in Asia Category:Crimes against humanity ","title":"Deportation of the Balkars"},{"id":"56704496","text":"The BYD G5 is a compact sedan that was produced by the Chinese automaker BYD. ==Overview== The BYD G5 debuted at the April 2014 Beijing Auto Show and was launched in September 2014.

He is an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In addition to publishing more than 60 academic papers, he has written or co-written 16 popular science and skeptical non- fiction books. He writes for several newspapers and journals on sociological and fringe science topics, including Psychology Today, Skeptical Inquirer, and British magazines The Skeptic and Fortean Times. He is an expert in fields such as mass hysteria and mass psychogenic illness and is frequently consulted by media during current events of sociological phenomena such as incidences of suspected mass hysteria or panic. ==Academic work== Bartholomew first obtained a radio broadcasting certificate studying at SUNY Adirondack in 1977 followed in 1979 by a bachelor degree in communications at Plattsburgh. By 1984 he had been awarded a masters degree in American sociology at SUNY. In 1992 he gained a masters in Australian sociology from Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia followed by a doctorate in sociology from James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. Finally in 2001 he gained his teaching qualification from Upper Valley Teachers Institute in social studies. Bartholomew has also lived and worked in Malaysia and in 2009 worked in sociology at International University College of Technology. In April 2010 he took up a teaching position at Botany Downs Secondary College in Auckland, New Zealand. He is currently an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In 2012, Bartholomew published Australia's forgotten children: The corrupt state of education in the Northern Territory: A case study of educational apartheid at an aboriginal pretend school in which he uncovered human rights abuses of indigenous Australian aboriginal children who were being exposed to harmful asbestos in the Northern Territory with the knowledge of the Northern Territory Department of Education. Bartholomew's principal area of academic contribution is in the field of mass psychogenic illness, previously known as mass hysteria, both historical and present day cases, an area he has been studying for over 25 years. He has written extensively about 600 notable instances including the Salem witch trials, the 2011 Le Roy illness, which Bartholomew has described as \\"the first case of this magnitude to occur in the U.S. during the social networking era\\", and present-day manifestations, most of which he has said have yet to be studied in-depth by sociologists. In 2016, Bartholomew investigated the 2012 case of an outbreak of hiccups in Danvers, Massachusetts (originally Old Salem village), in which 24 young people were stricken with apparently uncontrollable hiccups. After requesting and reviewing state documents from the original investigation, he concluded the most likely explanation was a psychogenic conversion disorder affecting the (predominantly) girls involved. He publicly stated the Massachusetts Department of Public Health had \\"knowingly issued an inaccurate, incomplete report...They have an obligation to issue accurate diagnoses, and patients have a right to know what made them sick\\" and filed official complaints of malpractice. Bartholomew has also drawn attention to the role of the internet in acting as an \\"echo chamber\\" for spreading moral outrage; for example on social media, pedophile allegations used as political weapons by supporters of the far right against liberal celebrities, which mirrors earlier public outrage which took the form of the Red Scare (particularly McCarthyism) and the Lavender scare against homosexuals in US government positions. Bartholomew is frequently interviewed as an expert on topics as diverse as the \\"Pokémon Panic\\" of 1997, the spread of UFO conspiracy theories, the 2016 clown panic (which he suggested was a moral panic fueled by social media in response to a fear of strangers and terrorism), the viral spread of online fads such as Pokémon Go, and the suspected sonic attacks on embassies in Cuba and China which began in 2017, about which he said: In 2020 he co-authored Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria, a book on the sonic attack controversy in Cuba with Professor Robert W. Baloh, a neurologist at the UCLA Medical Center. The authors document dozens of similar examples of disorders that have essentially the same features as \\"Havana Syndrome\\", but were given different labels, from the 18th century belief that sounds from certain musical instruments were harmful to human health, to contemporary panics involving people living near wind turbines. In March 2020, Bartholomew was invited to attend a medical conference in Havana, Cuba, on the \\"attacks\\", where he repeated the claim that stress-induced mass psychogenic illness was the most likely cause. ==Publications== ===Academic papers=== Bartholomew has written over 60 academic papers including: * Protean nature of mass sociogenic illness (2002) with Simon Wessely, British Journal of Psychiatry * A social-psychological theory of collective anxiety attacks: the \\"Mad Gasser\\" reexamined (2004) with Jeffrey S.

Primarily the CLOUD Act amends the Stored Communications Act (SCA) of 1986 to allow federal law enforcement to compel U.S.-based technology companies via warrant or subpoena to provide requested data stored on servers regardless of whether the data are stored in the U.S. or on foreign soil. ==Background== The CLOUD Act was introduced following difficulties that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had with obtaining remote data through service providers through SCA warrants, as the SCA was written before cloud computing was a viable technology. The situation was highlighted from a 2013 drug trafficking investigation, during which the FBI issued an SCA warrant for emails that a U.S. citizen had stored on one of Microsoft's remote servers in Ireland, which Microsoft refused to provide. The legal challenge led to the Supreme Court in Microsoft Corp. v. United States. The FBI contended that Microsoft had full control of the data and should be compelled to turn it over in response to the warrant, but Microsoft argued that the SCA did not cover data stored outside the United States. The challenge identified that while the FBI could request a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) to aid in data discovery during cross- border law enforcement, the process to acquire a new MLAT if one is not in place, or to process a request through an existing MLAT, can be slow and impede law enforcement efforts. Congress, primarily led by Senator Orrin Hatch, had attempted to create legislation prior to the CLOUD Act to amend the SCA with the concerns of Microsoft and other technologies companies with respect to foreign privacy rights. The \\"Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act\\" (LEADS Act) in 2015 and the International Communications Privacy Act (ICPA) in 2017 were both previous bills intended to amend the SCA but which failed to gain passage. The CLOUD Act is a culmination of these prior bills. Principally, it asserts that U.S. data and communication companies must provide stored data for a customer or subscriber on any server they own and operate when requested by warrant, but provides mechanisms for the companies or the courts to reject or challenge these if they believe the request violates the privacy rights of the foreign country the data is stored in. It also provides an alternative and expedited route to MLATs through \\"executive agreements\\"; the executive branch is given the ability to enter into bi- lateral agreements with foreign countries to provide requested data related to its citizens in a streamlined manner, as long as the Attorney General, with concurrence of the Secretary of State, agree that the foreign country has sufficient protections in place to restrict access to data related to United States citizens. The first such agreement was with the United Kingdom. There is a FAQ appended to the white paper published by the U.S. Department of Justice. ==Support== The CLOUD Act had support of the Department of Justice and of major technology companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google. The bill was criticized by several civil rights groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch. These groups argued that the bill stripped away Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, since the government could enter into data rights sharing agreements with foreign countries and bypass U.S. courts, and affected users would not have to be notified when such warrants were issued. Some of these groups feared the government would not fully review requests from foreign countries for their citizens' stored on servers in the U.S., potentially allowing such data to be used in bad faith in those countries. ==Passing== After being introduced in the 115th United States Congress as H.R.4943, the act was included as section 105 of H.R.1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, an omnibus spending bill, which passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law, P.L. 115-141, on March 23, 2018. On April 17 2018, the Supreme Court, based on concurring briefs submitted by the Department of Justice, vacated the United States v. Microsoft Corp. and remanded it back to lower court to do the same, as the Department of Justice was able to secure a new warrant under the CLOUD Act and was no longer pursuing the initial warrant, rendering the case moot. ==International reactions== The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) viewed the CLOUD Act as a law in possible conflict with the GDPR.Don't Get Spooked by the CLOUD Act The German data protection watchdog has warned against the use of US based Amazon Web Services for storing sensitive data for the federal police. The law has been viewed as a parallel to China's National Intelligence Law. ==References== Category:Acts of the 115th United States Congress Category:United States federal computing legislation Category:Privacy of telecommunications Category:Privacy law in the United States ","title":"CLOUD Act"},{"id":"56704582","text":"Anne Montagu, Viscountess Mandeville (1604 - 14 February 1642), was born Lady Anne Rich, the daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, an English colonial administrator who opposed the policies of Charles I prior to the English Civil War.

The Earl of Warwick was an English colonial administrator, admiral, and Puritan. ==Marriage and family== On 1 July 1625, aged around 21, Anne Rich married Edward Montagu, then Lord Kimbolton. This was Montagu's second marriage; he had previously been married to Susanna Hill, who died after less than two years without having any children. In 1626, when his father was created an earl, Montagu became known as Viscount Mandeville. Through his wife's father, the Earl of Warwick, Montagu began to have Puritan sympathies and to oppose the policies of King Charles I of England. During the Civil War, Montagu became an important commander of Parliamentary forces. Viscount and Viscountess Mandeville had three children: *Lady Anne Montagu (died 1689), who married Robert Rich, 5th Earl of Warwick, and had children *Lady Frances Montagu, who married Henry Saunderson *Robert Montagu, 3rd Earl of Manchester (1634-1682).

Chekhov in My Life, published posthumously in 1947.Avilova's biography at Russian Writers (dictionary), pp. 19-20 // Русские писатели 1800–1917: Биогр. слов. – М., 1989.-Т.1.-С.19-20. ==Biography== Lydia Alekseyevna Strakhova was born in the Klekotki estate, Tula Governorate, Russian Empire, into the family of a local gentry. After graduating from a gymnasium in 1882, she worked for a while as a school mistress, then in 1887 got married and moved from Moscow to Saint Petersburg and started writing. A frequent guest at the house of the editor and publisher Sergey Khudekov (her sister Nadezhda's husband), she was introduced to many well-known authors of the time. In 1889 she met Anton Chekhov and became his regular correspondent, receiving regular advice on the literary technique and style, as well as occasional help with making her stories published. In 1890, assisted by Alexander Sheller-Mikhaylov, Avilova debuted as a published author with a short story called \\"Two Beauties\\" (Две красоты). Since then her work started to appear regularly in the periodicals like Sever (North), Detskoye Chteniye (Children's Reading), Niva, Russkiye Vedomosti, Syn Otechestva, Novoye Slovo. In 1896 Avilova's first story collection Lucky Man and Other Stories (Счастливец и другие рассказы) came out, to be followed two years later by her debut novel Inheritors (Наследники). Her second novel Deceit (Обман) was published by Vestnik Evropy in July 1901.L.A. Avilova. Stories. Commentaries // Писатели чеховской поры: Избранные произведения писателей 80--90-х годов: В 2-х т.-- М., Худож. лит., 1982. Т. 2. In 1906 Avilova returned with her family to Moscow and in the course of the next ten years published several books, including The Power and Other Stories (Власть и другие рассказы, 1906) and First Grief and Other Stories (Первое горе и другие рассказы, (1913), most of them dealing with childhood and child psychology, and much indebted to Chekhov's legacy. In 1914 Avilova became a member of the Russian Literary Society and in 1918 joined the Union of Writers. In 1922 she visited her ailing daughter in Czechoslovakia and became close to the local circle of Russian emigres, but decided to return to the Soviet Union in 1924. \\"Where there is no Russia, there is no myself,\\" she wrote. In 1929 she was elected an honorary member of The Soviet Chekhov society. Lydia Avilova died in Moscow on 27 September 1943. She was buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery, but the location of her grave has been lost since. The interest in Avilova's literary legacy enjoyed a revival in the 1980s when several of her books were re-issued in the USSR. ===Avilova as memoirist=== Chekhov in 1889, the year he and Avilova met for the first time Avilova's final work, a book of memoirs called A.P. Chekhov in My Life (А.П. Чехов в моей жизни, originally \\"The Love Affair of My Life\\", Роман моей жизни), completed in 1939 and published posthumously, in 1947, caused much controversy. It was based upon the premise that the two \\"had had a secret love affair which lasted a decade and nobody was aware of.\\"Foreword to the Memoirs. Literary Heritance, Vol. 69 // ...[Р]оман, о котором никогда никто не знал, хотя он длился целых десять лет. - Предисловие к воспоминаниям — ЛН, т. 68, стр. 260. Avilova claimed that Chekhov's \\"About Love\\" (1898) was a thinly veiled comment on their secret relationships and that the two discussed this fact in their correspondence, one of his letters (which was among the ones she had destroyed) having been even signed \\"Alyuokhin\\", which was the name of this story's protagonist. Maria Chekhova reacted with skepticism to this revelation. \\"These memoirs are lively and exciting, and many of the things she states in them are undoubtedly true... Lydia Alexeyevna seems to be totally sincere when describing her own feelings to Anton Pavlovich... When it comes to his own feeling towards her, things start to look a bit too 'subjective',\\" she wrote in her book From Distant Past.Чехова, М.П. Из далекого прошлого, стр. 166—167. Ivan Bunin, on the other hand, never doubted the memoirist's sincerity. He wrote: \\"Avilova's memoirs, brilliant, highly emotional, written masterfully and with great tact, became a revelation to me. I knew well Lydia Alexeyevna, a gifted woman with a rare sense of humour, who was also a very honest and shy person... Never did I suspect though, that they had this sort of relationship.\\"И. А. Бунин. Собр. соч. в 9-ти т. Т. 9. М., 1967, стр. 230. In one of her retrospective reviews, making a collective portrait of Chekhov, Tolstoy and Gorky, Avilova wrote: \\"... As for Chekhov, I would not call him either a great man or a great writer ... He was a likeable, talented author, an intelligent man and an intriguing character. Gorky: a brilliant writer and highly original man. Tolstoy: a great writer, a great thinker and a great man. Think of a talent breaking through the personality, struggling to lift it up to its own level, and that is Chekhov. Think of a talent and personality which are equally strong and bright; they express themselves in different ways, but, intertwining, merge into one. That is Gorky. But when both the literary gift and the personality are not just great and powerful, but also perfect, soaring well above mankind and near to God's level, then that is Tolstoy.\\" ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Imperial Russian women writers Category:Russian women novelists Category:Russian women short story writers Category:Russian children's writers Category:People from Tula Governorate Category:Women children's writers Category:19th-century Russian women writers Category:19th-century Russian writers Category:20th- century Russian women writers Category:19th-century Russian short story writers Category:20th-century Russian short story writers ","title":"Lydia Avilova"},{"id":"56704733","text":"Inge Senoner (born 21 February 1940) is an Italian alpine skier.

Arthur Hippler characterized the day-to-day social organization of Hunters Point as \\"matrifocal\\". The Big Five first became active in the early 1960s, confronting poverty and discrimination in Hunters Point, filling the void left by weak religious leaders. Pat Womack identified them as \\"strong Black women who took a stand\\" alternate URL They won fame by marching in 1973 in Washington DC for funds that had been promised to complete the housing to replace temporary housing in Hunters Point, not leaving until they had secured a $30 million grant. Streets and landmarks in the neighborhood have since been named in their honor. ==Biographical sketches and legacy== The Big Five are identified in a 1996 oral history as Julia Commer, Bertha Freeman, Osceola Washington, Elouise Westbrook, and Rosalie Williams. One source from 2007 identifies Ruth Williams as one of the Big Five instead of Bertha Freeman. A second source from 2011 states the Big Five includes Beatrice Dunbar instead of Rosalie Williams and identifies Julia Commer as \\"Julia Coleman\\". A third source from 1972 states Ardith Nichols was one of the Big Five instead of Rosalie Williams.

It was designed by Artúr Meinig for Count Gyula Andrássy, who was the second Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary and first Hungarian prime minister. The legend says that the count built the castle in honour of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (also called Sissi) but it is not proven that she ever stayed in Tiszadob. ==History== The castle and the surrounding park was built between 1880 and 1885. The architect, Artúr Meining built the castle, showing the characteristics of neo-Gothic and Romantic style. The building has 4 entrances in accordance with the 4 seasons, 12 towers for the 12 months, 52 rooms for the 52 weeks of the year and 365 windows for the 365 days of the year. Meinig got his inspiration from European castles, one of the most obvious example for that is the ceiling of L shaped large salon on the ground floor, which is the exact copy of the ceiling stucco of the Cartoon Gallery room of Knole Castle in Kent, England. The castle was raided by savages from the nearby town, Polgár in 1918 during the Aster Revolution. They destroyed not only the furniture but all the paintings, Venetian mirrors, ceramics, books. Locals say that the count never returned to Tiszadob after the incident. The Andrássy era ended in 1945. First it was an army hospital for the Romanian army. Many soldiers still rest in the park of the castle. Later, in 1948 the state confiscated the castle and from 1950 it became an orphanage and worked as one until 2007. ==Renovation== A large renovation was carried out to the order of Szabolcs- Szatmár- Bereg county's local government between 2011-2014. The renovation was funded by both the Hungarian government and the European Union, and cost approx. EUR 7,1 million. The aim of the refurbishment was to enable Tiszadob and the Andrássy Castle to host a range of cultural attractions. It reopened its gate to visitors in 2015 and since it offers a variety of programs for the locals and tourists. ==Piano Feast in the East== Adrienne Hauser founded a piano festival called Piano Feast in the East in 1998. Since then the most prestigious Hungarian and international musicians gather and perform every August.

Walter J.

When Mitchell became a judge, his son James C. Mitchell took over operations for the Times Crescent and remained owner of the paper until his death in 1989. The newspaper went by the name Crescent from its inception until January 14, 1898, when it was renamed to The Times Crescent. The paper ran under this name until March 24, 1966, when it was briefly changed to The Times-Crescent The Charles County Leaf. On May 27, 1971, the paper returned to its previous name, but with a dash between the words: Times-Crescent. Finally, in 1989, the Times underwent its final name change and became The Charles County Times- Crescent, which is its name to this day.

This species is the basalmost ankylosaur known to have had a proper tail club. ==Discovery and naming== Holotype skull shown from above and below In June 2008, farmer Li Meiyun on a construction site at Huzhen in Jinyun County discovered the remains of an ankylosaur. Between 2008 and 2014 excavations took place by a joint team of the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, the Jinyun Museum and the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum. In 2013, five ankylosaurian skeletons were uncovered. A new species was to be based on two of these, while preparation of the other finds continued. In 2018, the type species Jinyunpelta sinensis was named and described by Zheng Wenjie, Jin Xingsheng, Yoichi Azuma, Wang Qiongying, Kazunori Miyata and Xu Xing. The generic name combines Jinyun with a Greek peltè, \\"small shield\\", a usual suffix in the names of ankylosaurians. The specific name refers to the provenance from China. The holotype, ZMNH M8960, was found in a layer of the Liangtoutang Formation dating from the Albian-Cenomanian, about one hundred million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton, with a complete skull, but lacking most of the hindlimbs, apart from the right humerus and the left thighbone. The paratype is ZMNH M8963, a skeleton lacking the skull but including the left lower leg and a complete tail club. It was found at two to three metres distance from the holotype. ==Description== Restoration The describing authors indicated a number of distinguishing traits. Some of these were autapomorphies, unique derived characters. Behind the nostril two additional openings are present, in ankylosaurids named the \\"C1\\" and the \\"C2\\", which in the case of Jinyunpelta are on a level with the centre of the nostril. On the front upper edge of the maxilla a triangular depression is present. The postorbital bone does not contribute to the rear edge of the eye socket. In the lower jaw, the front part of the prearticular bone is positioned beneath the rear part of the splenial bone. Obliquely above and to the inside of the inner condyle of the thighbone a distinct tendon scar is present. Additionally, Jinyunpelta shows a unique combination of traits that in themselves are not unique. The combined upper side of the nasal bones is pierced by two paired oval openings. The antorbital fossa, with ankylosaurs the remnant of the antorbital fenestra, extends over the contact point of the maxilla, lacrimal bone and jugal bone. The prefrontal bone extends to below, touching the maxilla. At least some dorsal vertebrae have an elongated centrum, 30% longer than wide. The tail club is hexagonal in top view, with the widest point located near the rear edge. ==Phylogeny== Holotype tail club In 2018, Jinyunpelta was, within the Ankylosauridae, placed in the Ankylosaurinae. This would imply that it was the oldest known ankylosaurine. A cladistic analysis showed that it was also the basalmost known ankylosaurine, placed below Crichtonpelta in the evolutionary tree. It would then furthermore be the oldest and basalmost ankylosaurid that is with certainty known to possess a tail club; previously this had been Pinacosaurus dating from the Campanian. The size of the tail club shows that this trait must have been developed early-on in the evolution of ankylosaurids. Additionally, Jinyunpelta was the most southern known ankylosaurid from Asia. ==See also== * Timeline of ankylosaur research *2018 in paleontology ==References== Category:Ankylosaurids Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of Asia Category:Fossil taxa described in 2018 ","title":"Jinyunpelta"},{"id":"56705040","text":"Andrea Hannos (born May 8, 1973) is a former Canadian professional road and track racing cyclist who first entered sport in track and field, specializing in the long and triple jump.

These Hellenistic communities descended from Greek migrants. Southern Italy was so thoroughly hellenized that it was known as the Magna Graecia. Each of the polities struck their own coinage. Taras (or Tarentum) was among the most prominent city states. By the second century BC some of these Greek coinages evolved under Roman rule, and can be classified as the first Roman provincial currencies. ==Themes and design== Location of ancient Greek colonies (names with red labels) in Italy and neighbouring regions A common theme in the Italiote coinage was to include portraits of gods or other mythological figures. Some featured animals and other symbols. For instance, the coins of Sybaris (Thurium) portrayed goddess Minerva. Inhabitants of Kroton (Crotone) adorned their coinage with images of Hercules. The city of Posidonia (Paestum) had received its name from Greek god Poseidon whose portrait they struck in their coinage. The city was founded by Sybarite colonists, and observes of Posidonian coinage included a symbol of their parent city, the bull. Taras, the most prosperous city state, struck coinage with dolphins and seahorses. The winged seahorse refers to Poseidon. A certain unusual coin from Neapolis (Naples) portrayed a bull with a human face. One theory for its origin is that it may have celebrated some sort of an alliance with the Romans. The city of Gelas in Sicily was founded by Rhodian settlers. It was originally known as Lindii after their home town Lindos, but the city was renamed after the river Gelas. They struck coinage with depictions of the local river god. Some tyrants in Magna Graecia advertised their victories in the Olympic Games by striking coinage that referred to these specific achievements. Style of figures in coins can be compared to pottery from the region. This gives clues about when the pottery in question was made. Furthermore, ages of the cities such Sybaris are well known. ==Weight standard== The weights of silver coinage were inherited from Corinthian merchants. Commercial ties between Corinth and Taras were tight-knit. This brought the Persian weight standard for gold coinage to Magna Graecia. Phocaean standard had also been in use in the region. Later, Aeginetic standard appeared and was briefly used. It had been brought to southern Italy by Chalcidian settlers. Cities in the region eventually adopted the Attic standard. Sicilian (or Macedonian) talent was used for gold rather than a heavier talent used in mainland Greece. ==Magna Graecia== The region of Magna Graecia included originally Greek cities such as Cumae, Herakleia, Kaulonia, Kroton, Lokroi, Neapolis, Metapontum, Sybaris, Taras, Thurii and Rhegion. The cities of Taras, Metapontum, Sybaris and Kroton were founded between c. 750 BC – c. 650 BC, and it is likely that they brought their knowledge of recently invented minting straight from their home cities. ===Taras=== Tarantine coin portraying a mounted soldier Coins of Taras from the 4th century BC picture a mounted cavalryman equipped with a shield. At that time no other Greek military equipped cavalry with shields. It can be deduced that the influence of Taras may have been responsible for the spread of shielded cavalry to other Greek polities. Throughout the Greek world it was common that weight standards of Hellenistic coinage decreased in weight over time. One explanation is that, as worn money circulated back to the issuing state, the worn coins were recoined. More noticeable reductions in weight can be occasionally attributed to a single event. During the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) coinage of Taras decreased in size noticeably, and the war also impacted coinage of certain other Greek polities in Italy. Silver coinage of Taras, Kroton, Herakleia, Thurii and Metapontum were 7.9 g in weight before the war, but decreased in weight and size to 6.6 g. Subsequent issue of Tarantine coins also suffered from debasement of five percent. This downward evolution was significantly affected by the financial strain caused by warfare for the Greek polities. For instance, countering the expansion of Rome caused considerable pressure for the Italiote city states. ==Sicily== Naxos was the oldest Greek city on the island. Chalcidean settlers founded the city in 735 BC. It was also the first city on the island to issue coinage. The city grew rich from producing wine, and it honoured the god Dionysos on their first coinage. Satyrs were another common theme on their coinage. Katana, founded in 730 BC by colonists moving out of the city of Naxos, was known for its masterful engravers whose work resulted in very fine coinage. Dionysios I, tyrant of Syracuse, destroyed the city of Naxos in 403 BC. Survivors from Naxos founded the city of Tauromenion in 358 BC. Himera and Zancle were two other early issuers of coinage on the island of Sicily. They were also founded by Chalcidean settlers. Nacona was a small Greek town in Sicily the existence of which, at an unknown location, is confirmed by coins bearing the legend \\"NAKONAION\\", or \\"ΝΑΚΩΝΑΙΩΝ”.James Millingen, Ancient Coins, pp. 33-35; Sestini, Lett. Num. vol. vii. pl. 1. During the 4th century BC coinage became scarce. Punic coins and Corinthian staters were the principal currencies in circulation. Carthaginian expansion in Sicily caused this disruption of the local monetary system. However, native Sicilian coinage lost even more ground during the 3rd century BC and largely disappeared. The Second Punic War was the cause of this latter disruption. Only rarely bronze coins were struck. The Second Punic War had similar effects in the Southern Italy. ===Syracuse=== In the 6th century BC Syracuse began minting their own coinage. They used Attic-Euboic weight standard, and it was rapidly adopted by the other polities of Sicily. In the 5th century a strong government and widely militarized society ruled by tyrants left behind abundant coinage. ==Roman provincial currency== By 210 BC Rome was controlling all of the Greek cities in the region. At the beginning of the next century a clear Roman influence on the Greek coinage can be noticed. Both iconography and style of the coins had changed. Greek coinage from this period can be classified as the first instances of Roman provincial currency. ==See also== *Coinage of the Social War (91–88 BC) *Greeks in Italy *Sicels ==References== ==External links== *List of the Greek city states and their coins Category:Ancient currencies Category:Ancient Sicily Category:Coins of ancient Greece Category:Coins of ancient Rome Category:Coins of Italy Category:Magna Graecia ","title":"Greek coinage of Italy and Sicily"},{"id":"56705097","text":"John Morrow (Born Belfast, Northern Ireland; 1930 – 2014) was a Northern Ireland short story writer and novelist.

In that year Dabrowski and Uszacki led a group of employees from the Plage and Laskiewicz factory, who in 1928 formed the Lubelski Klub Lotniczy (Lublian Aviation Club), referring to the Ptapta as the LKL I. The factory allowed use of their workshop and the LOPP provided funding and loaned an engine. It flew for the first time either on 21 September 1928 by Antoni Mroczkowski or 10 October. With a light load it could be flown aerobatically. The largely aluminium-alloy framed Ptapta was a biplane with a larger span and chord upper wing. Both upper and lower wings were built around two duralumin spars, with wooden ribs and fabric covering. They were rectangular in plan apart from slightly angled tips and mounted with marked stagger. Only the upper wings carried ailerons. The upper and lower wings were braced together with a single interplane strut with flared ends on each side and the upper wing was attached to the fuselage centrally by a pair of transverse cabane inverted V-struts to the spars. Its Walter NZ 60 five- cylinder radial engine was installed, with its cylinders exposed for cooling, in a pointed nose where the oval section duralumin fuselage structure was covered in dural sheet. A long cut-out in the fuselage with dural decking ahead of it contained the two open tandem cockpits. The forward position was under the wing trailing edge, in which a cut-out provided a better field of view and eased access. Elsewhere the fuselage was fabric covered. The Ptpta's fin was triangular in profile and carried a deep, rectangular rudder. A triangular tailplane carried rectangular elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement; it was placed at the top of the fuselage and braced from below by a single strut on each side. The Ptapta had conventional, tailskid landing gear of the divided type, with mainwheels on cranked axles from the central fuselage underside, with trailing struts acting as radius arms and vertical main legs equipped with rubber shock absorbers. ==Operational history== Some six weeks after its first flight the Ptapta took part in the Second National Lightplane Contest, again flown by Mroczkowski. It finished in eighth place. In the summer of 1929 the Ptapta was modified by the removal and covering-over of the front cockpit and its replacement by a large fuel tank to allow an attempt on the lightplane distance record. The extra fuel gave a calculated range of though, as the record was soon broken by others, yet more fuel was required. A newer, , Walter NZ engine was also fitted. Before attempting the record flight the Ptapta took part in October 1929 in the First Tour of Southwestern Poland and then, flown by Władysław Szulczewski, made a trial endurance flight which was curtailed by bad weather. A record attempt was made on 30 April 1930 but ended immediately in the destruction of the very heavily loaded aircraft, which stalled on take-off from Poznań. Other accounts of this loss give different dates and places. ==Specifications (two-seater) == ==References== Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:1920s Polish sport aircraft ","title":"DUS III Ptapta"},{"id":"56705107","text":"is a Japanese volleyball player.

He was also a Member of Parliament from the Bács-Kiskun County regional list of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) from 2004 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2014. ==Biography== Garai was born in Berettyóújfalu on 15 June 1955, as the son of teacher István Garai Sr. and health visitor Erzsébet Szabó. He finished his elementary studies in Szank and secondary studies in Kiskunfélegyháza, where graduated at the Móra Ferenc Secondary School in 1973. He earned his degree of general practitioner at the Medical University of Szeged (today a faculty of the University of Szeged, SZTE) in 1979. He started his professional career in the local hospital of Kiskunfélegyháza. He made a special examination of internal medicine in 1985. He was elected to the local council of Kiskunfélegyháza in 1985, serving in this capacity until 1990. He chaired its health and social committee. He joined the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) in 1988. After Mihály Korom resigned from his parliamentary seat (Bács-Kiskun County Constituency VIII) under social pressure on 30 May 1989, Garai was nominated the ruling communist party's candidate for the position. He won the two by-elections held throughout in 1989, but turnout was too low to make the ballots valid in both cases. Garai was a founder of the local organization Democratic Youth Federation of Kiskunfélegyháza (Fédisz), which initially was established as an autonomous regional branch of the Hungarian Democratic Youth League (DEMISZ) in Kiskunfélegyháza, the short-lived successor organization of the Hungarian Young Communist League (KISZ). Its first congress elected Garai as leader of the organization. Meanwhile, he also joined the newly established Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) in October 1989, the legal successor of the MSZMP. The Fédisz transformed itself as a party to the 1990 parliamentary election. They made an electoral coalition with the local Regional Democratic Youth Alliance (Tedisz) from Kiskunmajsa, the two parties had only one individual candidate, István Levente Garai, who ran in the Kiskunfélegyháza constituency and came to the fourth place. During the 1990 municipal election, he was elected to the local representative body of Kiskunfélegyháza as the list leader of Fédisz, where he chaired the health, social and family protection committee, and was also a member of the culture, education and youth committee. Garai participated in the 1994 parliamentary election as a candidate of the Socialist Party and secured an individual mandate, representing his hometown Kiskunfélegyháza. He sat in the Social and Health Committee until the 1998 parliamentary election, when he lost his parliamentary seat against Fidesz candidate Sándor Endre. Garai was again defeated by Endre in the 2002 parliamentary election, while MSZP became the governing force. However, Garai secured a mandate two years later from his party's Bács-Kiskun County regional list on 27 August 2004, when replaced Csaba Tabajdi, who was elected to the European Parliament. He worked for the Social and Family Committee until 2006 and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for a brief time. He was a member of the Health Committee from 2004 to 2014. Meanwhile, Garai served as deputy mayor of Kiskunfélegyháza between 2002 and 2010, and was considered a strong local ally of mayor József Ficsór (SZDSZ). During the 2006 parliamentary election, Garai defeated Endre after two unsuccessful attempts and became MP for Kiskunfélegyháza again after eight years. In the 2010 parliamentary election, he lost to Krisztián Kapus (Fidesz). He became a Member of Parliament through the Socialists' Bács-Kiskun County regional list. Garai was nominated to the MSZP's candidate for the mayoral position of Kiskunfélegyháza in the 2010 local elections, after Ficsór retired from politics, but he was again defeated by Kapus. Garai functioned as MP until the 2014 parliamentary election, when he ran as a joint candidate of the Unity parties in Kiskunfélegyháza (Bács- Kiskun County Constituency IV), but came only to the third place after Sándor Lezsák (Fidesz) and László Kollár (Jobbik). ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1955 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Hungarian physicians Category:University of Szeged alumni Category:Members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Category:Hungarian Socialist Party politicians Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1994–1998) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2002–2006) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2006–2010) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2010–2014) Category:People from Berettyóújfalu ","title":"István Levente Garai"},{"id":"56705430","text":"Cuvillier Verlag is a German-based international publisher for dissertations, habilitation, scientific monographs and brochures.

After a training as a screen printer he educated himself as an industrial engineer through a correspondence course. He was not allowed to study painting since he was lacking the \\"Abitur\\" educational achievement, but Gerhard Kettner, president of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, provided him with a teaching assignment for screen printing anyway. Götze painted in his spare time, but he was not allowed to exhibit because of regulations in East Germany - formally he was a printmaker, not a painter. Because of these restrictions he filed an application for an exit permit 1985 which was granted in 1988. He immediately moved from Dresden to Munich, West Germany, where he opened up a printshop for artists. He is also co-owner of a garment company. == Works == Terragraphy No. 643: Warumungu (Tennant Creek, Australia) In 1989 Götze started to work on a project called \\"Erde\\" (\\"Earth\\"). He collects soil samples at extraordinary sites of human history around the world and applies them to paper, lime mortar or other backgrounds, making use of a standardized, self- developed technique he calls \\"terragraphy\\": He grinds the soil, mixes it with a binder and then applies it making use of a technique similar to screen printing. All backgrounds are square and of identical size. For each site the resulting works of art are given an individual name that reflects the importance of the site. According to Götze, the pictures capture th \\"spirit and energy\\" of the place where the soil was gathered. German theatre researcher Christopher Balme described Götzes role during the emergence of his works as that of a \\"medium in a shamanistic sense\\". During the course of the project, Götze visited various European and North American countries as well as e.g. Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Madagascar, New Zealand, South Africa, Tibet and Venezuela. In addition to the prints Götzes uses photos of the sites to contextualize the prints. Between 1990 and 2001, Götze compiled and published 13 artist's books depicting the \\"Erde\\" works, one site per book. For the book about New Zealand he cooperated with local artist Christina Wirihana. In 2014 he designed an album cover for German jazz trio Kolb Schindler Schubert. Götze runs a studio in Sendling. He is a member of the Neue Gruppe, an association of Munich artists regularly exhibiting at the Haus der Kunst museum. In 2018 Götze has been awarded the Seerosenpreis, a yearly award assigned to visual artists by the city of Munich. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === * 2009: Bild der Erde (Berlin, Federal Foreign Office) * 2011: Das Bild der Erde (Munich, vernissage in the Center for Advanced Studies at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) * 2017: Erde und Licht (, Chiesa Bianca di Maloja) === Group exhibitions === * 2009: Made in Munich: Munich Editions 1968-2008 (Munich, Haus der Kunst) * 2012: Possible Water (Tokyo, Goethe-Institut Tokyo, with i.a.

A patrol of German and Norwegian police troops had been tipped off that weapons were hidden in Haglebu and came up from Eggedal on a search. On the southern shore of Haglebuvannet, the German force divided to search both sides of the lake. On the western side, the Germans received machine-gun fire from the Norwegian resistance movement (Milorg) and soon came under attack on the eastern side as well. After about four hours, during which the Norwegians repulsed the German assaults, Milorg carried out an orderly withdrawal before German reinforcements arrived. Albeit a small battle and local in nature, it had a large effect on the course of the war in Norway. The battle marked a defeat for Norwegians who collaborated with the Germans. This may have contributed to the collaborators' acceptance of the German surrender, which prevented further fighting between Milorg and the collaborators.Strande, 1977 p. 162.

She earned a PhD in immunology in 1998 from the University of Leeds for research investigating the effects of pleiotropic cytokines on liver cells. == Research and career== Since 2007 Cruickshank has worked in the Department of Immunology at the University of Manchester. She uses in vitro and in vivo approaches to characterise crosstalk between immune cells, commensal bacteria, pathogens and epithelial cells. These experiments make use of infectious models, including Toxoplasma gondii and Trichuris muris, to understand immunity regulation in the skin and gut. By identifying how the skin and gut recognise and respond to the microbiome, they are starting to understand how it affects cell function. Cruickshank won the Northwest BioNow award for her test for the management and assessment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. BBC Radio 4 broadcast in 2018 in the series The Life Scientific Sheena Cruickshank's reflections on her life and career. Her brother was passionate about science and particularly marine biology which inspired her to have an interest in science from an early age.

Kip's great-grandparents, Samuel Kip and Anna Herring, who owned the Kips Bay farm at the time of the American Revolution. Kip was born on January 15, 1845, in New York City. He was the son of Elbert Samuel Kip (1799–1876) and Elizabeth (née Goelet) Kip (1808–1882). Growing up, Kip lived with his parents, his sister Margaret (who died young), and the family's servants in a house overlooking Washington Square in Manhattan. Both of his parents inherited a substantial amount of property and never worked during their lifetimes. On his father's side Kip was a descendant of Jessé de Forest and Hendrick Hendricksen Kip, founder of the Kip family of Kips Bay, Manhattan. During the American Revolution, his great-grandparents Samuel Kip and Anna Herring owned the famous Kips Bay Mansion, the oldest house in Manhattan until it was taken down in 1851. On his mother's side, Kip was a great-grandson of Peter Goelet, a wealthy New York merchant and progenitor of the Goelet family real estate fortune. Kip attended Columbia University as an undergraduate, graduating in 1865. While at Columbia, Kip served as the President of the Peithologian Society, a student debating society. He received his LLM from Columbia in 1867. ==Career== 1912 Newspaper Article about the Havemeyer Family, the family of George G. Kip's wife Anna Kip was a partner in the law firm DeWitt, Lockman and Kip, based at 88 Nassau Street, for a number of years, along with George Gosman DeWitt and John Thomas Lockman. In 1882 he represented his cousins Robert Goelet and Ogden Goelet (builder of Ochre Court and father of Mary Goelet) before the New York Supreme Court in a legal battle that erupted over control of trusts set up by Peter P. Goelet and Jean B. Goelet for their nephews. Kip's firm was known for its work defending the estates of New York's old Dutch families. In the 1880s, Kip moved his family and servants to Ruremont, an 11-acre country estate on Madison Avenue in Morristown, New Jersey, a street then known as \\"Millionaires Row.\\" In 1902, the Town and Country Life magazine wrote that Ruremont, “with its smooth lawns and well-ordered gardens and greenhouses,” was “one of the most attractive places in Morristown.” Kip was a member of the exclusive Holland Society of New York, the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, the University Club of New York and The Metropolitan Club. He also maintained an extensive correspondence with preservationist John Muir, of whom he was a friend and financial supporter. ==Personal life== Morristown Memorial Hospital Building donated by Kip On May 23, 1867, Kip was married to Anna Margaret Geissenhainer (1847–1893) in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania by the Rev. George W. Schumucker. Anna was the daughter of the Rev. Augustus T. Geissenhainer and Amelia (née Havemeyer) Geissenhainer. She was also the niece of three-term New York City mayor William Frederick Havemeyer. Her mother and uncle were children of William Havemeyer, founder of the sugar refining company that would become the Sugar Trust (later Domino Sugar). Through her father, Anna was also a second cousin of the New Jersey congressman Jacob Augustus Geissenhainer. Together, George and Anna were the parents of three children: * Charles Augustus Kip (1870–1940), married Marie Gilmour Bryce (1878–1940). * Elbert Samuel Kip (1874–1950), married Alice Alden Bushnell (1872–1952), a granddaughter of the industrialist and oil trader Daniel Bushnell. Alice's nephew, Joseph Bushnell Ames, was a prolific novelist during the early 20th century, and her first cousin, Mary Warden Harkness, was the wife of Charles W. Harkness. Another one of Alice's nephews, Peter Ashmun Ames, a member of the Cairo Gang, was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army in Dublin on Bloody Sunday while working as an agent for the British MI5. * Anna Elizabeth Kip (1880–1918), married A. Paul Olmsted (1882–1948), the son of Charles Sanford Olmsted, the Bishop of Colorado. His wife died suddenly of heart failure on April 5, 1893, and in 1898 Kip funded the construction of the Anna Margaret Home for Convalescents, the main building of the new Morristown Memorial Hospital, in her honor. Kip died at his home in Morristown on June 27, 1926. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==External links== * Category:1845 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Goelet family Category:American lawyers Category:American socialites Category:American upper class Category:Columbia Law School alumni ","title":"George Goelet Kip"},{"id":"56705936","text":":Not to be confused with the author of Tesla: Man Out of Time Margaret Cheney (born 1955) is an American mathematician whose research involves inverse problems.

Founded in 1958, Cantina Terre del Barolo is one of the most historic cooperative wineries still active in Piedmont.G. Parusso, 2009, pp. 74-75 ==History== ===Genesis of the project=== The territory of Langhe has always been a land of renowned wines, however the first decades of the twentieth century were characterized by difficult periods: the two world wars, the phylloxera epidemic and periods of economic depression due also to a market of grapes characterized by more and more strong speculations to the detriment of winemakers. The idea of founding a cooperative winery in Castiglione Falletto is due to the intuition of Arnaldo Rivera, son of winegrowers in the area. Already his father founded a cooperative winery in the twenties but didn’t have the hoped success, anyway Arnaldo Rivera had the mind to repeat the company. Before even developing the project to involve local winegrowers, as a primary school teacher of the country as it was, he proposed almost like a game to their students to set up a sort of cooperative of the hens with the purpose of financing the year-end school tour with the sale of the eggs. This didactic experiment, so-called “the hens' cooperative”, carried out as a capital for each student, was successful and at the end of the school year, its dissolution was unanimously approved with the consequent sale of all the hens.G. Parusso, 2009, p. 52 In the 1958 Rivera he succeeded in overcoming the widespread distrust of cooperative associations since in the first half of the twentieth-century various wine consortia had also failed due to a lack of dynamic market.As the famous producer Bruno Giacosa declared in his Lectio Magistralis: «There was also the market of grapes in Alba, of which I, like the many farmers who brought the grapes there, I do not have a good memory, because the mediators always waited until the last moment before buying, so the winemakers were forced to sell at any price so as not to bring back the full cart. It was a bit sad, especially when there was not much demand for grapes from the bottlers. Instead, we preferred to go directly to the farms, also because so we could choose the grapes that we liked directly on the spot. After buying the grapes, I also gave a hand in the cellar, where it was still produced a bit 'of wine that was then sold in bulk to those same companies that also bought grapes. Making wine made more money, but it was really good because otherwise there was a risk of not selling it.» While continuing his activities as an elementary teacher and mayor of Castiglione Falletto, the project of a new wine cooperative involved him in the development of local resources and helped to safeguard the interests of the wine sector in the area, avoiding further speculation. Rivera was able to convince many winegrowing friends in difficulty but also mayors of other municipalities and then public bodies and banks to obtain the necessary funding.G. Parusso, 2009, pp. 65-66 ===The foundation of Cantina Terre del Barolo=== On December 8, 1958, with a deed of incorporation drafted in the hall of the Town Hall of Grinzane Cavour in front of the notary Italo Ferrero, Cantina Terre del Barolo was founded with headquarters in Castiglione Falletto and the founding members at the time of foundation, represented by President Arnaldo Rivera, were twenty-two.The founding members of the Terre del Barolo cooperative were: Battista Alessandria, Giuseppe Ardito, Pietro Bosco, Enrico Bosso, Luigi Brignone, Alfredo Castagno, Pietro Castagnotto, Giuseppe Destefanis, Enrico Fava, Giuseppe Molino, Angelo Moscone, Giovanni Negro, Francesco Porasso, Paolo Porello, Giovanni Rabino, Arnaldo Rivera, Francesco Rivera, Giuseppe Roddolo, Andrea Roggero, Luigi Roggero, Renzo Roggero, Giovanni Veglio. The works for the construction of the plant, designed by the engineer Biagio Soave and the architect Elio Celato, left after in 1959 on land partly purchased by the diocese and partly by the peasants and, in the meantime, the members of the association rose to over three hundred. In January 1961 the first ordinary assembly met to approve the first balance sheet which amounted to Lire 187,915,461 with revenues of Lire 2,666,913. ===Growth during the difficult seventies=== In 1968 the budget of Cantina Terre del Barolo exceeded one billion lire and the plant was expanded to accommodate new oak barrels but also new spaces for the grapes provision, whose sale by the winegrowers partners no longer represented a problem as in the past. Despite the economic crisis of the early seventies, the cooperative winery began to be known by participating in various trade fairs in Alba but also in Turin, Milan, Genoa, Parma, Verona and was also organized a first distribution network. In 1970 the Terre del Barolo cooperative winery also received two Diplomas with a Gold Medal, following participation in the 2nd National Competition of Italian Wines held in Milan. In 1974 the Cantina Terre del Barolo reached almost five hundred members and, despite the less abundant vintages, production and sales were destined to rise. ===The eighties=== At the beginning of the eighties, the cooperative winery received in New York the prestigious American award “Italian Barrel Wine” for a 1979 Nebbiolo d'Alba decreed as one of the best Italian wines. The number of members settled at 550, with a budget that was close to seven billion lire. In 1983 the twenty- five year activity was celebrated and Arnaldo Rivera, in a speech during the ceremony said that «a social entity that acts democratically sharing the income in relation to the participation of members can be a winning idea, breaking down the prejudice that men are destined to be armed against each other in the name of individual privilege and egoism». In December 1986 Arnaldo Rivera resigned and after his death in 1987, took over Francesco Conterno who held the office of president until 1990, taking care to complete the process of renewal already started with Rivera, that included also the purchase of new equipments, the creation of an internal analysis laboratory and the modernization of the offices. ===The cooperative from the nineties to today=== Since 1990 Matteo Bosco became the new president of the cooperative and the members were reduced to about four hundred, although nevertheless achieving satisfying results about production and quality; important renovations and expansion of the cellar and refining rooms were also carried out.G. Parusso, 2009, p. 127 The flood of the Tanaro in 1994 damaged many municipalities and territories in the area, so the cooperative deliberated the granting of financial contributions in support of the most affected members. Since 2001, the cooperative has decided to set up an annual award to be awarded only to women distinguishing themselves for success in their professional field and the first woman to be awarded was Carla Fracci. In the following years, the Terre del Barolo Award was awarded to Luciana Littizzetto, Margherita Hack, Micol Fontana, Elena Sofia Ricci, Dacia Maraini and Enza Sampò. Under the leadership of the new president Paolo Boffa the Cantina Terre del Barolo in 2017, on the eve of its sixtieth anniversary, has commemorated its founder by creating a special selection of Barolo DOCG called ARNALDORIVERA. ==The wines== The cooperative winery mainly produces red wines produced exclusively from the Langhe grapes, respecting the DOC and DOCG regulations, including an organic line. The main wines are classified as Barolo, Nebbiolo, Barbera, and Dolcetto, to which is added a small production from the native Pelaverga and Nascetta wines. An Alta Langa DOCG \\"Metodo Classico\\" sparkling wine, a Barolo Chinato and a Barolo Grappa complete the range. ==Certifications== ===Quality=== • BRC (GSF Global Standard Food) • ENI EN ISO 9001: 2008 • IFS (International Food Standard) • ISO 22000: 2005 • ISO 22005: 2008 • Biological ===Environment=== • ISO 14001: 04 • EMAS ==See also== * Arnaldo Rivera * Barolo * Langhe ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * Official website: http://terredelbarolo.com Category:Italian companies established in 1958 Category:Italian brands Category:Wineries of Italy Category:Food and drink companies established in 1958 ","title":"Terre del Barolo"},{"id":"56706288","text":"The Women's team tournament of the 2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships was held from 29 April to 6 May 2018.

Name is derived from tit (sjenice in Croatian) and the municipality of Lasinja. On 21 September 1897, residents of Sjeničak Lasinjski rose in rebellion (known as Sjeničak rebellion, Croatian: Sjeničarska buna) against (perceived) Hungarisation and loss of privileges previously granted to them as border guards. A number of young men from the village, Dr. Gojko Nikoliš being one of them, went to Spain to fight as members of the International Brigade in 1936-1937. Sjeničak Lasinjski suffered significant demographic losses in the World War II with 352 of its residents perishing. Out of those, 137 were civilian victims of fascism, 68 were fallen partisans and 111 succumbed to typhoid.Dušan Baić \\"Kotar Vrginmost u NO borbi 1941-1945.\\"/\\"District of Vrginmost during National Liberation War 1941-1945: Sjeničak Lasinjski\\", pages 60-623, 1980 ==Culture== The first Serbian Orthodox Parish in the village, which included the village of Prkos Lasinjski, was established in 1715.

Pictures Brasil and Globo Filmes. Starring Xuxa Meneghel and Pedro Malta with the participation of the voice actors Flávia Saddy, Bernardo Coutinho, Guilherme Briggs, Gustavo Pereira, Milton Gonçalves. The film follows Guto, a 7-year-old boy who gets help from his guardian angel - Xuxinha - to fight junk-eating monsters that come from the planet XYZ, which is located in a distant galaxy, and will live in Pumzão Stream, right in the neighborhood where Guto and his friend Jonas live. The Pumzão is the ideal place for the invaders, who eat garbage and want to transform the Earth into a dump. The two will go through innumerable adventures and rely on the help of the wise homeless philosopher Euclides Arquimedes, Detective Txutxucão, and Jonas. But the great help comes from Heaven: Guto and Jonas' guardian angels: Xuxinha and Biel. The great heroine is the blonde, who gives up her angelic powers to save Guto and the planet. Still in 2004, Xuxa Meneghel considered the possibility of producing a cinematographic animation later that year. The project had the first title \\"Adventures of Xuxinha\\", but the project was canceled. Almost a year after the first announcement in 2005, Xuxa announced the launch of its first animated film. Betting on a new formula, TV hots left its traditional movie format and bet on an animation. Xuxinha e Guto, was the film is the first Brazilian animation released in 3D format. He performed poorly at the box office, grossing just R$ 2,948,878 million reais across Brazil, with 596,218 the worst box office performance of a Xuxa movie since Xuxa Requebra (1999). The film has received negative reviews from specialist critics. A sequel, came to be considered, but was canceled due to the film's box office failure. == Plot == Like every 7-year-old, Julian (Pedro Malta) seeks answers and explanations for the existence of some spiritual beings. This is the case with the guardian angels. Xuxa Meneghel, always convinced of their existence, the elves and God, tells the nephew how he met his guardian angel, called Xuxinha. When Xuxa grew up, she had to go her way without the help of a faithful protector. Xuxinha was given the job of protecting another small man, Guto. Perhaps the most damned of all, the angel always had to do the impossible to save him from the confusions and dangers in which he entered. Xuxinha also counts on the aid of Biel, angel of the guard of Jonas, the great companion of adventures of Guto. One day, the country is invaded by Xyzígenas, garbage-eating monsters from the planet XYZ, located in a distant galaxy. Knowing that Earth's inhabitants used to throw debris into the streams, polluting all the rivers of the planet, they decided that it was the best place for domination there. The first resident to believe in the invasion was the wise Euclid Archimedes. All but the detective dog Txutxucão, Guto and Jonas discredited him. Together, they resolve to fight these stinking monsters, who have dominated the entire punch stream. Xuxinha and Biel also resolve to investigate the case, not knowing that this involvement would bring definitive consequences to the life of the angel. == Cast == *Xuxa Meneghel as Herself and narrator *Pedro Malta as Juliano Narração *Flávia Saddy as Xuxinha *Bernardo Coutinho: Guto *Gustavo Pereira as Jonas *Guilherme Briggs as Detective Txutxucão / Monsters / Fireman *Milton Gonçalves as Euclides Arquimedes *Pedro Henrique Albuquerque as Biel *Ana Lúcia Menezes as Babies *Emília Rey as Sarita Malaguenha and Vozeiros *Felipe Grinnan and Vozeiros *Fernanda Baronne as Dona Rô and Vozeiros *Alexandre Moreno as Grilo and Policial xyz 2 *Joaquim P.O'rey as Fael *Júlio Chaves as Pai de Jonas *Lina Rossana as Velha *Lúcio Mauro Filho as Sr.Sid *Luiz Carlos Persy as Robot / Doctor *Marcelo Coutinho as Police Officer / Police Officer xyz 1 / Driver / Vozeiros *Márcia Coutinho as Vozeiros *Márcio Simões as Smart Mice *Mário Monjardim as Galileu Newton *Paulo Goulart as São Pedro *Pedro Lima as Guel *Tom Cavalcante as Douglas Wender *Adriano Santos as Police Officer / Firefighter / Douglas Wender / Father of Jonas / Doctor *Cinthia Delmaschio as Stand in Xuxa Meneghel ==Production== Still in 2004, Xuxa Meneghel considered the possibility of producing a film animation later that year. The project had the first title \\"Aventuras da Xuxinha\\", and would have as heroine a blonde girl, true miniature of the hots. But the project was budgeted by Ancine (Agência Nacional do Cinema), with a forecast of an expense of R$7.5 million reais, which Xuxa and its production considered very high, so the project was postponed to the year 2005, and in its place the TV hots debuted Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida at the end of that year (2004). Almost a year after the first announcement, on June 24, 2005 Xuxa announced the release of his first animated film titled Xuxinha e Guto Contra os Monstros do Espaço, which premiered in cinemas all over Brazil in December of that year. Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço the film is the first Brazilian animation in second and third dimension. Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço had a team of 70 animators from Twister studio, it was generated in computer, totally digital technology. The film is equated with Disney animations, but it did not cost 1% of the budget for such productions. The final value reached R$6 million reais, which was hosted by TV Hots itself, which boasts of the animation hub created for this production. As in the four previous films of Xuxa, the direction is of Moacyr Góes, the animation director Clewerson Saremba and the production, of Diler & Associates. It took a year to get ready. It is therefore a mixture of cartoon and live action scenes (with actors acting). Betting on a new formula, TV hots Xuxa Meneghel abandons its traditional film format and this year reaches theaters in an animation. Director Clewerson Saremba explains that the film was drawn and animated completely on the computer. \\"The process of animation was based on that of conventional studios.The difference was to change the role for the computer when drawing\\". It was not by accident that Xuxa and the producer of his films Diler Trindade decided to bet on the animation this year. Clearly, there is an attempt of renewal since, every year, its productions have been earning less at the box office. Xuxa explained that he agrees with the participation of animation characters to reduce production costs: With a script signed by Flávio de Sousa, the film is faithful to what the presenter believes. \\"We do not care about being educational. That's up to the school, not the TV Shows and Films,\\" he says. Still, the theme of the film is ecology and the importance of recycling. Despite the small participation in front of the cameras, Xuxa says that he throbbed a lot in the production of the drawing. \\"I'm a little annoying. Sometimes she thought that Xuxinha looked fat or sneaky, she had to change. Ten seconds of film took a week to be redone. A lot of things have been thrown in the trash, hours of work.\\" The character Xuxinha has been present in the DVDs and TV Shows of Xuxa since 1997, In the same year, the character Guto was created to represent the male children's audience of the new line of baby cleaning products. Xuxa and Pedro Malta are the only real appearances in the film, the other characters are made in computer graphics and dubbed by voice actors. ===Music=== The soundtrack of the film of the same name, released in 2005 by Som Livre.

If it works out, in the next one I will participate more in the scenes\\". on December 17, Xuxa checked the result of the film for the first time alone.

His father, Timofei Dryomin (born 1968), was a struggling businessman. Dryomin has an older brother, Bogdan (born 1992). Their parents divorced when the younger son was less than a year old. Both children were baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church. Their mother was devoutly religious, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia when Dryomin was in the eighth grade. As a youth, Dryomin participated in boxing at school and won medals in city competitions. In 2013, Dryomin and his friends swore a blood brother oath to the allegiance of Adolf Hitler to lead racial holy war. However, Dryomin quickly realized the wrongfulness in such white nationalist views and has since disavowed such beliefs. He was a member of the gopnik subculture and joined \\"Aurora Gang\\", a youth street gang, and was nicknamed Batei Aurora, after the street he grew up on. This gang engaged in petty crime including underage drinking, vandalizing cars, shoplifting, and street fights. In 2014, Dryomin supported himself by growing and dealing marijuana and hashish from his rented apartment. He was caught by police and sent to live with his grandmother. It was then that he turned away from his life of hooliganism due to fear of being killed or incarcerated, and started to create music. == Career == In 2015, Dryomin attended a concert by Russian rapper Pharaoh and was inspired to make his own rap songs. His stage name Face was invented with his brother and is meant to characterize his many-sidedness and constant metamorphosis in his work. He released his debut EP Проклятая печать (en. Cursed Seal) on SoundCloud on October 30, 2015. A video was released for one of its tracks, \\"Гоша Рубчинский\\" (en. \\"Gosha Rubchinskiy\\"), a homage to the fashion designer of the same name, on January 3, 2016. Face released three EPs in 2016: Vlone, Mayhem, and Playboy. He released the EP Revenge in 2017. He released two full-length albums, Hate Love and No Love, in 2017, as well as non-album singles \\"Бургер\\" (en. \\"Burger\\") and \\"Я роняю запад\\" (en. \\"I'm Dropping the West\\"), the latter a sarcastic take on Russian patriotism with a music video that features the rapper riding a bear and standing on a burning American flag. Face's songs are often profane, sexually explicit, and contain references to drugs, which has led to socially conservative law enforcement in Russia to cancel his concerts. In response to this censorship, he released a politically-charged album, Пути неисповедимы (en. Mysterious Ways), on September 2, 2018, that criticizes the corruption and social problems in Russia, which he has described as a \\"third world country.\\" Face had received offers from President Vladimir Putin's public relations officials to produce pro-government content for the Kremlin, but turned it down. His latest album, Slime, was released on February 1, 2019 and spawned the singles \\"Woof\\", \\"Мой калашников\\" (en. \\"My Kalashnikov\\"), and \\"Спасательный Круг\\" (en. \\"Lifebuoy\\"). He also released the titicular soundtrack song for the Mikhail Idov drama film Юморист (en. \\"The Humorist\\") === Artistry and image === Dryomin's hip hop influences include American rappers such as A$AP Rocky, Kanye West, Playboi Carti, Lil Pump and Lil Uzi Vert. Outside of rap, he also enjoys soul artist Marvin Gaye, and rock bands Best Coast, and Nirvana. Dryomin has several tattoos, including the words \\"Hate\\" and \\"Love\\" below each of his eyes, the word \\"Numb\\" on his forehead, the Playboy bunny and Vlone logos on each of his forearms, and the words \\"Rock\\" and \\"Star\\" on the back of each hand. == Personal life == Dryomin has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and experiences panic attacks. He received treatment for mental illness for two weeks at a psychiatric hospital. He references this event in his song \\"Burger\\": \\"I'm so fucking crazy, I was in the loony bin.\\" The video for the song was partially filmed outside a psychiatric hospital named after former Moscow mayor Nikolay Alekseyev. Dryomin moved from Ufa to Moscow with his brother Bogdan in April 2017. He has been dating Russian YouTuber Maryana Ro since September 2017. In 2018, Dryomin had been considered to be drafted into the Russian Armed Forces but was declared as unfit for military service because of medical reasons that include mental illness. == Discography == === Albums === * 2017 Hate Love * 2017 No Love *2018 ' (en.

It is also called style Rocaille or Rococo style. The Italian architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli is the key figure of this trend, which is still given the name 'Rastrellian Baroque'. The Russian architect Savva Chevakinsky is also a renowned figure representing this style. == Style == Unlike the former Russian Baroque styles such as Petrine Baroque, the Elizabethan Baroque tended to appreciate the Muscovite Baroque, and maintained the very essence of Russian architectural elements like the five cupolas shaped like onions. The Elizabethan Baroque tended to create the architecture of grandeur in order to glorify the might of the Russian Empire. Rastrelli designed majestic palace complexes in Saint Petersburg and its environs: the Winter Palace, the Catherine Palace, and the Peterhof Palace. These palaces are characterized by gigantic proportions, golden splendour decorations, the use of two or three shades of colour for their façades, the refinement added by their gilding, give these buildings a particular style. The festive character of Rastrelli's work left its mark on all the Russian architecture of the middle of the eighteenth century. His most spectacular work is the Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg, the model he had made demonstrates the ambition of the original project that was not completed: the immense pyramidal steeple was never built. Rastrelli was influenced by the French architects Germain Boffrand and Robert de Cotte; the great architects of Central Europe, from Balthasar Neumann (Würzburg) to François de Cuvilliés (Munich), from Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann (Dresden) to Fischer von Erlach (Vienna, Salzburg); the monasteries in Moscow; not to mention the reminiscences of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Italian Baroque. He adapted the Italian Baroque taste to the immensity of the landscape of St. Petersburg, his art is made of an amalgam of all these styles, which he has managed to transcend into an original synthesis, more Russian than European. Apart from some interiors, it is not quite correct to regard this style as Rococo; for example, the fronts of the Winter Palace by Rastrelli, with exuberant coloured stuccos marked by mighty colonnades and delicate window openings, possess the solidity of the mature Baroque rather than the curvilinear lightness of the Rococo. The Elizabethan Baroque style is also found in the works of Muscovite architects of the mid-eighteenth century, particularly those of Dmitry Ukhtomsky and Ivan Fyodorovich Michurin. In St. Petersburg, with the empress Elizabeth Petrovna, a host of architects competed in the realisation of palaces: , Savva Chevakinsky, Andrey Kvasov, among others. The Swiss architect Pietro Antonio Trezzini was the specialist in the field of religious buildings. With the exception of some constructions by Andrey Kvasov, Antonio Rinaldi, Johann Gottfried Schädel and Rastrelli's Saint Andrew's Church in Kiev, the style is rarely seen in Ukraine. After the death of the empress Elizabeth Petrovna, the construction orders were passed to Antonio Rinaldi, who had previously worked for the small courtyard of the Oranienbaum Palace. He refused to imitate the grandiose achievements of Rastrelli and introduced the Rococo style into the architecture of the court. In the years following 1760, Rinaldi, like other renowned architects, abandoned the Baroque style and turned to the aesthetics of Classicism. == Gallery == File:Saint Petersburg Saint Nicholas Naval Cathedral IMG 6929 1280.jpgSt. Nicholas Naval Cathedral File:Nicholas Naval Cathedral detail Saint Petersburg.jpgDetail of St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral File:Церковь священномученика Климента, папы Римского (Москва) 05.jpgSt Clement's Church, Moscow File:Krasnye vorota.jpgRed Gate in Moscow File:Ямбург 0033 Екатерининский собор.jpgSt. Catherine Cathedral, Kingisepp File:St. Petersburg - The Church of the Resurrection in the Catherine Palace - Церковь Воскресения Христова в Екатерининском дворце - panoramio (2).jpgWest façade of the Catherine Palace File:Ukhtomskychurch.jpgPalace Chapel of the Catherine Palace File:Зимний Дворец.....jpgDetail of the Winter Palace File:Stucco-wall.jpgStucco wall of the Winter Palace File:Grand Cascade at the Peterhof Palace (21118700966).jpgGrand Cascade at the Peterhof Palace File:Every little detail is golden.JPGGrand Cascade and the church File:Петергоф Большой дворец Церковный корпус сбоку.jpgChurch at Peterhof Palace File:Palais de Peterhof - église - détail.jpgDetail of the church at Peterhof Palace File:St'Andrei church (17258848551).jpgSaint Andrew's Church in Kiev File:Андріївська церква на Андріївському узвозі, №23 у Подільському районі м.Києва. 4.JPGDetail of St. Andrew's Church File:Iconostasis in St. Andrew's Church.JPGIconostasis in St. Andrew's Church == References == Category:Baroque architecture in Russia Category:Baroque architecture in Ukraine Category:Baroque architecture in Latvia Category:18th century in the Russian Empire ","title":"Elizabethan Baroque"},{"id":"56707200","text":"Patricia Clark Kenschaft (born 1940) is an American mathematician.

In addition, Jha has pioneered clinical management guidelines for concussions through working with others in his field, internationally. Neilank Jha also established the first academic journal dedicated to the research of concussions. == Early life and career == Neilank was born in Edmonton, Alberta and grew up in Regina, Saskatchewan where he had a passion for playing hockey. At age twelve, he moved to India, where he lived in an ashram until he was seventeen. Through his monastic experience in South Asia, Neilank Jha practiced asceticism, sleeping on the floor and owning only two sets of clothes. Upon his return to Canada, Neilank pursued his undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, medical school and neurosurgical residency at McMaster University, and spinal surgery fellowship at the University of Toronto. At McMaster University, Neilank Jha was the chief resident in neurosurgery in 2010 when his mother, herself a nurse, suffered a concussion after falling down a flight of stairs. Her CAT scan was normal and she was diagnosed with a concussion and discharged from the hospital a few hours later and advised to return to work in a few days. She was unable to return to work as a nurse due to “persistent cognitive challenges and headaches”. Months later with no explanation for her persistent symptoms, no objective diagnostic tool or proven treatment she remained off work. This experience resulting in Neilank dedicating his life to concussion management and research, a departure from his extensive training in operating on the brain and spine. Neilank has become an advocate for patients with concussions and has urged professional sports leagues to invest in R&D; and better protocols to protect current and future athletes while also committing resources for retired athletes.\\" Neilank has encouraged the responsible management of concussions in both athletes and non-athletes. == Research == Neilank Chaired an International Concussion Conference in Toronto in September 2015 and published a white paper entitled ‘Solving the concussion crisis’, co-authored by others in the field.

The series order was reportedly for a first season of nine episodes. The pilot episode aired after the 90th Academy Awards as a \\"sneak peek\\" on March 4, 2018. Production companies involved in the series include Baldwin's company El Dorado Pictures. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporters Lacey Rose, Baldwin went on to elaborate on his reasons for committing to the program. He explained how the limited number of episodes allowed for greater freedom and discretion when it comes to selecting guests. He specified the type of guests they were looking for saying, \\"The idea of doing a TV show was never really that attractive to me—because when we do the show for radio, it's one kind of reality. The minute you put a camera on people, they change...Why don't we try it and see if we get people who are more camera-ready? I wouldn't mind interviewing Jennifer Lawrence or somebody if we could find an angle that was different or fresh.\\" Notable personalities that Baldwin mentioned as possible guests included Stephen King, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, and Bruce Springsteen. On May 15, 2018, it was announced that the series, now retitled The Alec Baldwin Show, would officially premiere in the fall of 2018 and air on Sundays at 10 PM On October 9, 2018, it was announced that the first formal episode of the series was scheduled to premiere on October 14, 2018, and that Robert De Niro and Taraji P.

On November 6, 2018, it was announced that ABC was moving the series from Sunday nights at 10 PM to a new time slot on Saturdays at 10 PM. The show was expected to return in its new time slot on December 8, 2018. On January 4, 2019, it was reported that ABC was pulling the show from its schedule and replacing it with reruns of other shows beginning the following night. ===Marketing=== On March 2, 2018, ABC released the first clips and photographs from the series. ==Episodes== ===Pilot=== ===Season 1 (2018–19)=== ==Reception== The series has been met with a negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 0% approval rating, with an average rating of 3.72 out of 10 based on 7 reviews. Upon airing, the pilot episode was met with a mixed response from critics. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned Sundays with Alec Baldwin a score of 47 out of 100 based on five critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In a positive review, Verne Gay of Newsday offered the pilot praise giving it two and a half stars out of four commenting on its potential, saying, \\"Baldwin is the sort of star—either actor, talk show host, POTUS, whatever—who elicits passion. Some people love him, others not so much. There's no middle ground and never has been, and into this no man's land he steps, along with future guests. Nobody's neutral about him, and their neutrality will be tested as much as his. The show's potential will rise or fall in those edgy encounters when they come, and they certainly should. That passion could ultimately be Sundays chief asset.\\" In a more negative critique, Kelly Lawler of USA Today said of the pilot, \\"Baldwin, who had a short-lived talk show on MSNBC in 2013, is a decent interviewer, but the talk never gets too deep or reveals new insights about his subjects\\" and that he \\"tries his level best, but the show is too slight to really click.

It has a single thin, more or less hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty small yellowish-green and red flowers. The plants grow in winter-wet areas, often in shallow water and unlike the similar M. cupularis do not turn black as they dry. == Description == Microtis orbicularis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, almost tubular leaf long and about wide. Between three and thirty yellowish-green and reddish flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem , reaching to a height of tall. The flowers are about long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear, about long, wide, pressed against the ovary and hidden below the labellum. The petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, about wide and spread apart below the dorsal sepal. The labellum is more or less round, shallow cup-shaped, fleshy, long and wide. Flowering occurs from September to December. ==Taxonomy and naming== The dark mignonette orchid was first formally described in 1907 by Richard Sanders Rogers from a specimen collected from a swamp near Myponga. In 2002, David Jones and Garry Brockman changed the name to Hydrorchis cupularis but the change has not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. The specific epithet (orbicularis) is a Latin word meaning \\"orbicular\\" or \\"having the form of a small circle\\", referring to the shape of the labellum. ==Distribution and habitat== Microtis orbicularis grows in swamps and seasonally wet depressions, sometimes with the base of the plant submerged. It is found between Dongara and Cape Le Grand in Western Australia, in coastal areas of eastern South Australia as far west as the Eyre Peninsula, in the south-west of Victoria and on the north coast of Tasmania. ==Conservation== Microtis orbicularis is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == Category:Prasophyllinae orbicularis Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1907 ","title":"Microtis orbicularis"},{"id":"56707977","text":"Marjorie Ruth Thorpe is a Trinidadian academic, lecturer, former diplomat and the first woman to have chaired the Public Service Commission (PSC) in Trinidad and Tobago.\\"Quiet service\\", Trinidad and Tobago Newsday, 25 July 2013.\\"‘Pres picked a woman to head PSC’\\", Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, 4 August 2013.

In November 1781 she carried to England the first news of General Cornwallis's defeat. The Royal Navy registered her under the name Cormorant. In 1783 the navy renamed her Rattlesnake. It paid her off and sold her in 1786. ==Privateer Rattlesnake== Rattlesnake was probably drawn by John Peck of Boston, Massachusetts, and probably built at Plymouth in 1780. She was very lightly built and was reputedly very fast. Rattlesnake had the appearance of a miniature frigate, with detached quarterdeck and forecastle. Rattlesnake was commissioned on 12 June 1781 under Commander Mark Clark (or Clarke).http://www.awiatsea.com/Privateers/R/Rattlesnake%20Massachusetts%20Ship%20[Clark].html#B000003T American War of Independence at Sea: Rattlesnake Massachusetts Ship (Clark).

On 19 July 1782 Cormorant recaptured Marine. On 2 July Marine, Rendel, master, had put Torbay, having been chased near Plymouth by a French privateer while Marine was sailing from Darmouth to Ireland.Lloyd's List №1377. On 30 July Cormorant captured the 10-gun naval cutter west south west of Cape Clear. She was armed with ten 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 50 men under the command of lieutenant de fregate LeFer. She was nine days out of Brest and taking dispatches to the combined fleets. Before he struck Le Fer threw overboard the dispatches, her logbook and papers, and eight guns. She then arrived at Cork.Lloyd's List №1386. In August 1783 the Navy renamed Cormorant Rattlesnake, and Commander John Melcombe recommissioned her. ==HMS Rattlesnake== On 3 November 1783 Rattlesnake sailed for the Mediterranean. On 10 November 1784, Rattlesnake, Captain Melcombe, was escorting the merchantman Countess of Tuscany to Gibraltar when they encountered an Algerine naval squadron of nine ships under the command of an admiral. The Algerine admiral pretended to believe that Rattlesnake was not a British warship and compelled both vessels to put into Algiers. There the Dey of Algiers detained them for five days before releasing them, without apology. On 29 November 1785 Commander Thomas Hamilton replaced Melcome. ==Fate== In July 1786, Rattlesnake was paid off.

In July 2016, an Airmont, New York man and father of 5 named Binyamin Gottlieb, alleged to having had a history of forcing gets, introduced the pair to Joe Levin, an informant whose real name was Avraham Lehrer.Whitehouse, Kaja (September 13, 2016). \\"Divorce Mediator Busted for Husband Kidnapping Plot\\", New York Post Levin, who advertised himself as a private investigator and divorce consultant to the Orthodox community was later described by defense attorneys as a \\"small-time fraudster\\" who disliked members of the Satmar sect. The three held a meeting in Rockland County, New York where a payment of $25,000 was discussed, and the possibilities of kidnapping Masri in Pennsylvania or Ukraine, a country that Masri intended to travel to for Rosh Hashanah, in order to torture him there into giving the get. Gottlieb delivered the payment, and discussed the possibility of luring the victim to Puerto Rico. On August 9, 2016, a second meeting of the three near Zenta Road in Kiryas Joel that was recorded by Levin for the FBI, narrowed down the plot to Ukraine. During a meeting of the three held 3 days later, the venue was changed back to the United States, and the two men gave Levin an additional $20,000 for planning.Zavadski, Katie (September 7, 2016). \\"Murder-for-Divorce Plot Ensnares Hasidic Rabbi in New York\\", Daily Beast Goldberg subsequently met Levin in Israel, where the former expressed his desire to not only kidnap Masri but also to kill him.Gajanan, Mahita (September 7, 2016). \\"Rabbi and Orthodox Jewish Man Plotted to Kidnap and Murder Husband to Get Divorce for his Wife, Officials Say\\", Time Woodbury Commons promenade On August 25, 2016, Liebowitz met up with Levin at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, New York to pay him an additional $12,000 that he had demanded. Levin called Goldberg, who was in Israel at the time, and spoke to him in Modern Hebrew over speakerphone about the \\"wedding in America,\\" understood by the FBI to be a reference to the kidnapping that was to take place in the U.S.: using a Hebrew term that refers to caring for the dead. After a brief silence, Goldberg responded, On September 2, 2016, Levin met Liebowitz at Woodbury Commons, and from the conversation they had he appeared to know exactly what Goldberg had planned, even though Liebowitz did not understand the Modern Hebrew language. Liebowitz opined that Masri, a taxi driver who occasionally traveled to Montreal could \\"miss a night, or even two or three\\" before his family grew concerned. Liebowitz added: Liebowitz then laughed and said he would carry on as if he knew nothing, letting the blame fall to Goldberg and the wife's family. Although Leibowitz later questioned the need to kill the victim instead of merely torturing him, Levin suggested they change the operation from a kidnapping to a murder. == Arrests and convictions == On September 6, 2016 Goldberg and Liebowitz met with Levin at a hotel in Central Valley. Levin told the two that \\"Masri was half dead already,\\" and they agreed to \\"do the bullet.\\" Goldberg said he would need proof of death to present to the beth din in order to declare the marriage over. Liebowitz asked Goldberg: As Levin promised to give Goldberg a video of the victim with a bullet in his head, the FBI burst in and arrested Goldberg and Liebowitz. At a news conference the following day, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara referred to the plot as \\"chilling.\\" On September 11, 2016, Binyamin Gottlieb was arrested as he boarded a flight to Ukraine at John F.

However, the Tupanvirus virion presents a large cylindrical tail (~550 nm × 450 nm diameter) attached to the base of the capsid. Some particles can reach up to 2.3 μm because of the variation in tail size. == Genome == The genome contains roughly 1.5 million base pairs of double-stranded DNA, coding for 1276–1425 predicted proteins. Many genes that encode for processes found in cellular organisms are found in Tupanvirus genome. As a giant virus, Tupanvirus present the largest translational apparatus within the known virosphere. The analysis of tupanviruses constitutes a new step towards understanding the evolution of giant viruses. == Host == Tupanviruses are able to infect protists and amoebas, but probably pose no threat to humans. ==References== Category:Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses Category:Unaccepted virus taxa Category:Mimiviridae ","title":"Tupanvirus"},{"id":"56708592","text":"Hyperaspis is a genus of lady beetles in the family Coccinellidae.

Oman has an embassy in Damascus; while Syria has an embassy in Muscat. Both are members of the Arab League (Syria was temporarily suspended in 2012), and despite the ongoing civil war occurring in Syria, Oman has not closed its embassy in Syria and both countries maintain diplomatic relations, in sharp contrast to other Arab states of the Persian Gulf who have cut off diplomatic ties with Syria and closed their embassies. == Syrian Civil War == Following the outbreak of the currently ongoing Syrian Civil War, gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain were quick to declare their support for the Syrian opposition against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, setting out to isolate the Syrian government by cutting off diplomatic ties, closing down their embassies, expelling Syria from the Arab League and imposing heavy economic sanctions. A notable exception in the policies of the gulf states was Oman, who not only refused to close down their embassies and cut off diplomatic ties, but also refused to support the Syrian opposition, with Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah stating that Oman’s role in the conflict would strictly be constrained to humanitarian assistance in sharp contrast with Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In August 2015, Oman invited Syrian delegation headed by Foreign Minister Walid Muallem to Muscat to meet with his Omani counterpart, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah. In October of that same year, Omani Foreign Minister traveled to Damascus, meeting with the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad himself to discuss Syria's ongoing civil war and defeating terrorism while assuring Oman's commitment to Syrian unity and sovereignty, with foreign minister Alawi saying that Oman \\"continues to exert every possible effort to help find a solution that would end the crisis in Syria,\\". In July 2019, Oman's foreign minister, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and foreign minister Walid Muallem on 7 July. Following the closed-door meeting, the Omani foreign ministry reported that Alawi had delivered a greeting from the Sultan of Oman to the Syrian President and talked about boosting efforts to \\"restore stability and security in the region”, as well as strengthening the Omani- Syrian relations.

Initially, the seminary was a four-year course offering coursework at the middle school level along with coursework on Tenrikyo doctrine and rituals. Since its establishment, Tenri Seminary has gone through a number of reorganizations.Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department (1986). The Teachings and History of Tenrikyo. Tenri, Japan: Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. p. 176. In 1908, the seminary was reorganized into the six-month Special Course (別科 Bekka) while Tenri Middle School continued as a separate organization. In 1938, the two-year Graduate Seminary program was established and two new courses were added – the Preparatory program which would educate graduates of Tenri Middle School and Tenri Girls School, and the Asian program which would train ministers for mission work in Asia.The Teachings and History of Tenrikyo, 176. In April 1941, the seminary underwent another reorganization. The most notable change was that the Special Course, which had trained 128,000 ministers over 65 sessions, was discontinued and replaced by the shorter, three-month Spiritual Development Course (修養科 Shūyōka). From that year onward, five programs were offered – Graduate, Junior, Preparatory, Asian, and Spiritual Development. Eventually the Preparatory and Asian Courses were discontinued and the Spiritual Development Course became a separate organization supervised directly by Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.The Teachings and History of Tenrikyo, 176-7. In April 1977, the five-year Daini Junior Seminary (第二専修科 Daini Senshūka) program was established but was eventually discontinued.The Teachings and History of Tenrikyo, 177. ==Programs== As of 2018, Tenri Seminary offers three two-year programs – Junior Seminary (専修科 Senshūka), Graduate Practical Training Program (本科実践課程 Honka jissen katei), and Graduate Research Program (本科研究課程 Honka kenkyū katei).Tenri Seminary.

The Graduate Practical Training Program combines academic study (of Tenrikyo theology, Tenrikyo history, other major religions) with pastoral work (door-to-door missionary work and church management). This program is open to Tenrikyo adherents who have graduated from the Junior Seminary or a four-year college and enrolls approximately 30 students each year. The Graduate Research Program focuses on the academic study of religion and of Tenrikyo theology. During the program, each student works on and completes a thesis pertaining to Tenrikyo theology. On a regular basis, Tenri Seminary publishes the Tenrikyōkō Ronsō (天理教校論叢), a collection of papers written by lecturers and students of the Graduate Research Program.

In his next match a week later, his first in the Plunket Shield, he took 6 for 38 in the first innings against Auckland. ==ReferencesCategory:1937 births Category:2006 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Canterbury cricketers Category:Wellington cricketers Category:Cricketers from Wellington City ","title":"Neville Huxford"},{"id":"56708834","text":"Hyphessobrycon brumado is a species of tetra fish belonging to the family characidae, inhabiting South American river of Rio Brumado and the Rio de Contas drainage. ==Description== Hyphessobrycon brumado is a long, slender fish, similar to many of its kin.

The broader meaning encompasses a synthesis of technological prowess, know-how and spirit of Japan's manufacturing practices. The spirit includes a sincere attitude towards production with pride, skill and dedication and the pursuit of innovation and perfection. It is currently a buzzword in Japan and many Japanese people believe that monozukuri has led Japan to a dominant position in the world market. == Overview == The Japanese word is a combination of 'mono' meaning thing and 'zukuri' meaning the act of making. It simply means craftsmanship or manufacturing and has come to be used as a buzzword in industry and mass media to embody the Japanese spirit and history of manufacturing. It is a word of Japanese origin and has only recently, since the latter half of the 1990s, come to mean manufacturing and production. Its usage was popularized after the promulgation of the Basic Act on the Promotion of Core Manufacturing Technology on March 19, 1999. ==Basic Act on the Promotion of Core Manufacturing Technology== The Basic Act on the Promotion of Core Manufacturing Technology Act No. 2 was established on March 19, 1999, to support the development of the manufacturing industry.

In 2015, she co-founded the startup Careship in Berlin, Germany as an online marketplace for in-home senior care. Albert helped raise $4 million in investor funding in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. Careship has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. == Careship == When Albert's grandmother became sick in 2014, her family had great difficulty finding a suitable caregiver. In response, she co-founded the startup Careship with her brother Nikolaus Albert to create a virtual marketplace for in-home senior care. Careship uses an online “matchmaking algorithm” to connect families needing senior care with qualified self-employed caregivers. Caregivers can help with common tasks such as cooking, shopping and cleaning. On the platform, caregivers set their own price and Careship handles billing and coordinating insurance payments. Albert and her brother raised $4 million in investor funding for Careship in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. The marketplace was initially only offered in Berlin but has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. They would like to expand into Austria in 2018. The business model used by Careship and similar services is controversial. Product testing organization Stiftung Warentest examined cleaning services in October 2014 and came to the conclusion that the service matched the online promise only in four out of ten cases. == Biography == Albert is from Vienna, Austria. She studied business administration in the Netherlands and Switzerland, receiving a BSc in International Business Administration in 2012 and a MSc in Strategic Management in 2013. Before co-founding Careship with her brother, she worked as a business economist for internet holding company Rocket Internet.

With its earliest beginnings in 1860, it has been published under the Herald banner since 2005. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media. ==History== The Barossa and Light Herald began publication on 10 May 1951 after Leslie Tilbrook (who had owned the Kapunda Herald since September 1923) sold the newspaper. A new publication was then created by the merger of: # Kapunda Herald (1860-1951): This publication began life as the Northern Star (1860-1863), the first English-language newspaper in regional South Australia. It then transformed into the Kapunda Herald and Northern Intelligencer (1864-1877) when it changed ownership. By 1878, and with another new owner, the title was simplified.Major shareholders were David James M.P., F. W. Young M.P., W. D. Taylor, and C. B. O'Reilly. # Barossa News (1908-1951): The first newspaper to provide any significant local news coverage to the Barossa towns, the Barossa News, was established by John Birdseye Cant, a Western Australian printer and newspaperman. Initially just 500 copies were printed, but after a few years the circulation had risen to 2,500. In 1981, the newspaper then absorbed the Eudunda Courier (9 February 1922–15 April 1981). The newspaper was later taken over by the Rural Press in the 1990s and was a part of the Fairfax Media group. In May 2005 the title was again shortened, this time to simply Herald, though the longer variants of the previous name (Barossa Herald, Barossa and Light Herald, or Barossa & Light Herald) are commonly used as well. ==Distribution== In 2012, the Herald claimed the largest circulation for a country newspaper in South Australia at 21,400 copies distributed weekly. By 2018, the average issue readership for the print version was calculated to be 29,000 Like other Rural Press publications, the newspaper is also available online. ==Digitisation== The State Library of South Australia carries microfiche copies of older versions of the newspaper. ==References== ==External links== * Herald website * Australian Community Media statistics Category:Newspapers published in South Australia Category:Publications established in 2005 ","title":"Barossa and Light Herald"},{"id":"56708984","text":"The list of shipwrecks in October 1835 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded or otherwise lost during October 1835. ==1 October== ==2 October== ==3 October== ==4 October== ==5 October== ==6 October== ==7 October== ==8 October== ==9 October== ==10 October== ==11 October== ==12 October== ==13 October== ==14 October== ==15 October== ==16 October== ==17 October== ==19 October== ==20 October== ==21 October== ==22 October== ==23 October== ==24 October== ==25 October== ==26 October== ==27 October== ==28 October== ==29 October== ==31 October== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1835-10 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in October 1835"},{"id":"56708987","text":"Weinzierl is a surname of German origin.

It occurs in the northern subtropical and in the tropical or equatorial waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. ==Description== Taonius belone is a large species of glass squid, which reaches a mantle length of up to 660 mm, the mantle being rather leathery in texture. It has short arms which have narrow protective membranes which widen near the arm bases where they join up to create an internal umbrella. Each arm has two rows of suckers which become denser towards the tips; there are at least 21 pairs of suckers on each arm, with the largest suckers around the 8th pair. The largest suckers each have 20–30, wide, tightly set teeth that cover entire margin of the ring; the smaller distal suckers have only 6-8 teeth while the suckers located near the arm bases have teeth which are merged and present a smooth surface except for few distal undulations. On the tentacular club the largest two suckers are in the middle two rows of the club manus and these have one or two enlarged, hook-like teeth with no other teeth present; the other enlarged suckers in the middle rows of the club have two large hook-like teeth which were nearly equal in size with 4-5 smaller secondary teeth. The suckers in the lateral rows of the manus are laterally compressed, each sucker bearing two long, curved teeth on distal and pointed teeth on the lateral margin of the sucker ring. The tentacular stalk has two rows of locking suckers on distal two-thirds to three-quarters on the stalk with an indistinct carpal cluster at base of manus. The mantle has a smooth skin and where it meets the funnel there are no tubercules. It has elongated, lanceolate fins which have a length equivalent 44% of the mantle length and at their anterior ends they are widely separated. The gladius protrudes out between the posterior ends of the fins to form a tail. ==Distribution== Taonius belone was originally collected in the Indian Ocean at 10°8'S, 97°14'E. SInce the type specimen was collected and described this species has been recorded off southern Japan, in the Philippine Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, and throughout the central equatorial Pacific. Its known distribution suggests that it is distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, but actual records are few and far between. ==Habitat and biology== Taonius belone is a large pelagic and oceanic squid, referred to as mesopelagic. It has planktonic paralarvae and the eye of this species changes during ontogenetic development. In waters off Hawaii, T. belone undertakes a downward vertical migration as it matures. The paralarvae have laterally compressed eyes at the ends of stalks and they can be found in the upper 400 m of the water column, while the larger juveniles occur at depths between , and the subadults which have hemispherical, stalkless eyes inhabit depths below 700 m. ==Taxonomy== Taonius belone was originally described as the nominate subspecies of a species then known as T. borealis, i.e. T. b. borealis. The other was T. b. pacifica. Both these taxa were considered to be members of the genus Belonella but this is now considered to be synonymous with Taonius. They are now thought of as sister species with T.belone in the tropical Indo-Pacific and T. borealis in the North Pacific. == References == Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1906 ","title":"Taonius belone"},{"id":"56709201","text":"Strathblock Castle, Uphall, West Lothian, Scotland, was a motte-and-bailey castle.

Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia XZ2 Compact at a press conference held at the annual 2018 Mobile World Congress event on February 26, 2018. It features Qi Wireless Charging, Dynamic Vibration System, 4K HDR Video Recording and has the standard 3.5 mm Headphone Jack removed. ==Hardware== ===Design and Build=== The Xperia XZ2 comes with the new \\"Ambient Flow\\" design. It consists of a new 7000-series aluminum alloy chassis that has a curved edge all around the device, and 2.5D scratch-resistant front and arched back glass panels made of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5, resulting in a symmetric and curvier design aesthetic. The most defining change in the Xperia XZ2, as well as the Xperia XZ2 Premium and XZ2 Compact, is the placement of the camera on the back. It is now symmetrically arranged on the top-center of the device, as opposed to being placed on the top left side like on previous Xperia smartphones. The NFC antenna is placed along the Triple Image Sensing System, the MotionEye camera module and the now US-enabled fingerprint sensor, symmetrically aligned near the top-center axis of the device. The front houses the improved dual front-firing stereo speakers, one on the top bezel along with a 5 MP front camera, ambient light and proximity sensor and notification LED, and the other on the bottom bezel in an elongated slit along the edge of the glass and frame. The Xperia XZ2's dimensions are in height, with a width of and a depth of and weighs approximately . The device comes in 4 colors: Liquid Black, Liquid Silver, Deep Green and Ash Pink. ===Display and Performance=== The Xperia XZ2 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, built on a 10 nm process technology with 8 custom Kryo 385 processors (4x 2.7 GHz and 4x 1.7 GHz), 4/6 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and uses the Adreno 630 for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 64 GB and comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, with both featuring LTE Cat. 16 with 3x carrier aggregation, a 4x4 MIMO antenna design with a total of 8 antennas. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 400 GB in a hybrid SIM 2 slot setup. ==Camera== ===MotionEye=== Sony debuted in the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the world's first three-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones. Known as the Sony IMX400, the sensor features a RAM chip sandwiched in between the sensor and control circuitry layers which serves as a large and fast buffer to where the sensor can temporarily offload a significant amount of captured data before transferring it to the phone's internal memory for processing. This enables the camera to record super slow-motion videos at 960 fps, at a steady 720p resolution. Recording at super slow motion is limited to 0.18 seconds per buffer though, due to limitations. The Xperia XZ2 borrows the Motion Eye Camera from the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZ1. It comprises a 19 MP 1/2.3” Exmor RS for mobile sensor with a 1.22 μm pixel pitch, f/2.0 aperture and 25 mm wide G Lens. It also features 4K HDR video recording, a world's first for Sony, which supports SteadyShot video stabilization alongside the standard 1080p/30 fps, a high-speed 1080p/60 fps and a 120 fps recording in 720p options. The front selfie camera has a 5-megapixel sensor (1/5\\") with 23 mm, f/2.2 lens, a 90-degree wide angle lens and SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization). ===Triple Image Sensing technology=== The Xperia XZ2 has the Triple Image Sensing technology that started with the Xperia XZ as standard. It is composed of the image sensing (CMOS sensor with PDAF), distance sensing (Laser AF sensor) and color sensing (RGBC-IR sensor) systems, featuring a hybrid autofocus that utilizes Phase Detection (PDAF) to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds, and also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking. It also has a laser autofocus sensor for fast tracking and locking focus on a subject, as well as an RGBC-IR (RedGreenBlueClear-InfraRed) color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the surrounding environment. It also has SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization first seen in the Xperia XZ. The Motion Eye Camera in the Xperia XZ2 also has Predictive Capture. When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of four photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in RAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960 fps super slow-motion videos. ===3D Creator=== The Xperia XZ2 is also capable of capturing 3D objects without the need of a dual-camera setup, a feature that was first implemented into the Xperia XZ1. It utilizes the IMX400's built-in DRAM to offload captured data before being combined and built up in the proprietary 3D Creator application, creating a near-perfect rendition of the subject, be it a face of a person, a whole head or any object the user may wish to capture. The user is then given the option to use the rendered 3D image on the included animated figures for a more creative approach or have it 3D-printed by Sony's approved 3D printing companies, all within the app itself. ==Battery== The Xperia XZ2 is powered by a non-removable 3180 mAh battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C port with support for USB 3.1 and Qi Wireless Charging. It also has Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan. ===Battery Care=== The Xperia XZ2 also comes with Battery Care, Sony's proprietary charging algorithm that controls the charging process of the phone through machine learning. It recognizes the user's charging habits for a certain period and automatically adjusts itself to the pattern, for example an overnight charge, by stopping the initial charging to about 80-90 percent, and then continuing it until full from where it left off the next day. This effectively prevents the unnecessary damage to the battery's cells from excessive heat and current due to overcharging, further increasing the battery's life span. ==Audio and Connectivity== The Xperia XZ2 is the first Xperia device that has no standard 3.5 mm audio jack, which has resulted in a somehow mixed reaction from users and critics alike. To make up for the removal, the XZ2 has improved wireless audio connectivity along with Sony's famed LDAC, an audio coding technology they've developed in-house, which is now a part of the Android Open Source Project, that enables the transmission of 24bit/96 kHz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX and Low Energy, NFC, 4x4 MIMO antennas for fast WI-Fi and cellular upload/download speeds, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, MirrorLink, screen casting via Miracast and Google Cast, DLNA, GPS (with A-GPS), GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. The Xperia XZ2, like most new smartphone nowadays, has no FM radio. ==Software== The Sony Xperia XZ2 was launched with the Android 8.0 Oreo operating system, along with Smart Stamina battery saving modes and Sony's proprietary multimedia apps. On October 12, 2018, the latest Android 9.0 Pie started rolling out in OTA updates along with monthly security updates to users worldwide. ==Variants== Sony Xperia XZ2 H8266 • GSM GPRS/EDGE: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz • UMTS HSPA+: 800 (Band VI), 800 (Band XIX), 850 (Band V), 900 (Band VIII), 1700 (Band IV), 1900 (Band II), 2100 (Band I) MHz • LTE Bands: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 26, 28, 29, 32, 38, 39, 40, 41, 66.

Wang Huizu or Wang Hui-tsu (1731–1807) was a Chinese scholar-official, jurist, historian and moralist in Qing dynasty China. He was a commentator on social and local governance issues, and he was also an administrator who preached benevolence in judicial affairs. == Early life == Wang Huizu was born on 21 January 1731 in Hsiao- Shan, in Zhejiang province, which is situated in the lower-Yangzi valley. This region was marked by the presence of Jiangnan, a city which was the center of Chinese literacy and an intellectually flourishing area. Wang Huizu's father, Wang K'ai, was the warden of a prison in Honan. Wang's mother was K'ai's concubine. Therefore, it could be said that Wang Huizu belonged to the local literati elite. However, Wang K'ai died in Canton in 1741, putting Wang and his mother into a precarious.situation. As a result, the young Wang was forced to struggle in poverty. == Life and career as an official == In 1747, at the age of sixteen, Wang Huizu passed the local-level examination and therefore gained the status of shengyuan (\\"born official\\"). He taught at school in the wake of this success and got married in 1749. Thank to his new status, he became in 1752 the private secretary of Wang Tsung-min, his father-in-law who was a district-magistrate. Wang Huizu specialized into judicial affairs, which was the most lucrative choice for a private secretary. He continued to work as a secretary in judicial matters for thirty-four years, but served sixteen different officials in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. In 1768, Wang Huizu completed the Provincial-level exam which gave him the status of Juren (\\"recommended man\\") after having failed height times. After three avorted attempts, he finally passed the highest level of the Civil Service Examination in 1775, reaching the status of Jinshi (\\"presented scholar\\"). This new status allowed him to be appointed magistrate of the district of Ning-yüan in Hunan province in 1786. He was re-appointed magistrate in 1788 in the neighboring district of Hsin-t'ien, and re-appointed again in Daozhou in 1790, always in Hunan province. He was dismissed from his post in 1791 because of what he presents in his autobiography as an intrigue against him. In fact, Wang was asked by his superiors to examine four human skeletons in the county of Guiyang, but he didn't find the requisite medical examiner in the imparted time, which offered a reason to the provincial magistrate to struck off Wang Huizu from the public administration. Afterward, he remained for a moment in Changsha but finally retired in his home district in 1793 where he focused on his work as a scholar. Wang Huizu became paralyzed in 1795 and died on the first of May 1807. == Scholarship == === The jurist === Wang Huizu wrote two guides of public administration which had become paramount for Chinese officials until the end of the Qing empire. The first one, Tso-shih yao-yen, was printed by Wang's friend, Pso T'ing Po, in 1785. The second, Hsueh-chih i-shuo (\\"Views on Learning Governance\\"), was published in 1793. In this second piece, Wang focused on county government and compared county magistrates to medicine men, wooden puppets or fragile glass screens: all these evocative comparisons reflect the officials' inability to manage an economically and demographically expanding society. Wang Huizu even stated in the preface of his book that he would make a critical study on the routine of Chinese local administrators. He expressed the idea that the scholar is much closer to the people than the administrator and that the official should rely on scholars if he wants to act efficiently, notably regarding the diffusion of Confucian moral values. He also underlined the importance of the hearing of people's plaints as one of the key for a good governance, notably because this activity creates a direct link between the magistrate and the civilians under his jurisdiction. In that respect, Wang Huizu thinks that magistrates should comment on plaints in public session rather than in private session in order to be heard by the community and to prevent the same trouble from coming back. Wang's work has been very influential for all the Chinese officials after him, there is no denying that his guides have a significant moral dimension. For instance, Wang advocates a compassionate vision of justice. He notably gives the counter-example of a particularly strict magistrate named Zhang, who sentenced a cheater at the civil service examinations to be cangued publicly. the latter asked for his sentence to be adjourned because of the examinations. As the magistrate refused, the cheater's bride committed suicide, and when the young man was released, he committed suicide as well. Therefore, Wang concludes that sentences should be softened by the principle of human compassion (qing). === The historian === Wang Huizu developed, throughout his life, a strong interest in history. His originality as an historian is that he understood the importance of practical devices, like indexes, as historical tools. His taste for history might have been originated by the Han-shu (history of former Han dynasty) he bought in 1769 in Beijing. Indeed, he certainly hadn't had the opportunity to become familiar with history before this time given his quite modest social origins. In the wake of this first purchase, Wang bought copies of all the twenty-four dynastic histories and compiled all the biographies encountered in these texts into an index in sixty-four volumes. This index called Shih-hsing yün-pien and published in 1783 became vital for the study of Chinese history during the Qing era. He also completed his most prominent piece by two other indexes called Chiu-shih t'ung hsing-ming lüeh and Liao Chin Yuan san-sih t'ung hsing-ming lu both dealing with homonyms found in the histories of the Chinese dynasties. They were respectively printed in 1790 and 1801.Between 1796 and 1800, Wang Huizu worked on Yuan shih pên-chêng, a historical criticism of the history of the early Yuan dynasty. === Autobiography === In 1795, Wang Huizu began to write his autobiography titled Ping-t'a meng-hen lu (\\"Traces of Dreams from a Sick Bed\\"). He first published it in 1796 but continued to enrich it regularly until 1806 and his sons even continued to fill it in after their father's death. This autogiography provides information on the life of the literati class in China but also on public administration, notably Wang's role as a magistrate. He advocates for mediation in the resolution of conflicts rather than lawsuits. If we take the example of formal adjudication, Wang Huizu tells us that when he was in Ning-yüan county in 1787, out of the two-hundred plaints he received each day, only ten usually led to a formal lawsuit. This shows that, in a majority of cases, arbitrage was used to ensure civil justice, this was a convenient mean to maintain social peace. Although, many literati got involved into literature, notably into poetry, this was not the case of Wang Huizu. However, he was in contact with other Chinese scholars such as the historian Zhang Xuecheng and Zhu Yun, who originated the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries under the Qianlong emperor, Shao Chin-Han, Liu Chu-kao or the bibliophyle Pao T'ing-po. === The moralist === Wang Huizu was also a moralist, he notably originated a handbook for the management of family-life called Shuang jietang yongxun (\\"Simple Precepts from the Hall enshrining a Pair of Chaste Widows\\"). Wang wrote that the two women who inspired his model of the virtuous, chaste wife were his mother and his father's second wife. The book was dedicated to educating his sons as future patriarchs. He underlines that the equilibrium of a family, especially the virtue of its women, depends on the zunzhang yueshu (\\"family elder's discipline\\"). ==References== Category:Qing dynasty essayists Category:Chinese jurists Category:Writers from Hangzhou Category:1731 births Category:1807 deaths Category:Qing dynasty historians Category:Historians from Zhejiang ","title":"Wang Huizu"},{"id":"56709250","text":"Timothy Jerrell Cunningham (December 21, 1982 - 2018)CDR Timothy J. Cunningham was a Harvard-educated doctor with the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. As an epidemiologist, he was a team leader in the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and was named in 2017 as part of the Atlanta Business Chronicle's 40 Under 40 list. He also was the co-author of 28 publications on topics about sleep deprivation, pulmonary disease and more. Cunningham graduated from Morehouse and earned his S.M. and Sc.D. from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. On February 12, Cunningham left work early, complaining of not feeling well. His parents drove from Maryland to his house in Atlanta and found his phone, keys, wallet, car and his beloved dog, Mr. Bojangles. There was a $10,000 reward being offered by his family in partnership with Crime Stoppers Greater Atlanta. Cunningham's remains were discovered Tuesday, April 3, 2018 in the Chattahoochee River in northwest Atlanta, police spokesman Carlos Campos said. According to Fulton County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jan Gorniak, the preliminary cause of death was drowning. A positive ID of the remains was made using dental records. == Disappearance == On February 7, Cunningham resigned from a special USPHS deployment team tasked with deploying to areas in need by sending an email to Commander Richard Dunville. “I thought he sounded exasperated,” Dunville told police. “In fact I would have encouraged him to stay on through June, when he would have received a service award, but he sounded too ready to leave.” His supervisor Janet Croft told police that Cunningham left work quickly saying he felt ill on the morning of February 12, shortly after he learned he had been passed over for a promotion. On the morning of February 12, 2018, Cunningham's mother received a text message from him at around 5:21 a.m. \\"Are you awake?\\" he asked. She did not respond, as her phone was in silent mode. \\"I wish I had that opportunity to answer that text,\\" she said later. He tried calling again, at 9:12 a.m. that day, but didn't leave a message when she didn't answer. A day before Cunningham disappeared he told his neighbor's husband that his wife should erase his cellphone number from her phone. == The search == While police interviewed those closest to Cunningham, local parks and cemeteries were searched on foot, and a helicopter scanned the area. There was no sign of Cunningham until the first week of April, over a month since he first went missing. Sgt. Cortez Stafford, a spokesman for the Atlanta Fire Department, said the department had previously searched the area of the river where the body was found on February 23. At that time, Stafford said, there was no sign of a body. \\"It could have been there or it could have moved there later. There's just no way to tell due to the rise and fall of the river,\\" he said. \\"It was very difficult terrain, very difficult to access the location of where Mr. Cunningham was found,\\" Stafford said. \\"It was in a remote area that's not easily accessible by walking trails, by vehicle or by people just being around there.\\" Cunningham's parents had been told that a body had been found four times since Cunningham initially went missing. They felt \\"heart-wrenching agony\\" each time, they said, only to learn it wasn't their son. \\"It takes you to a place that the light is not shining in,\\" Terrell Cunningham said. \\"I won't call it a dark place, but they are lows. This is extremely hard.\\" On April 3, 2018, two fishermen notified police after they spotted a body buried in mud and tangled in debris on the banks of the Chattahoochee River. There were no signs of trauma on the body, such as cuts or bruises, despite its state of advanced decomposition consistent with having been submerged, according to Fulton County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jan Gorniak. According to Maj. Michael O'Connor of the Atlanta Police Department, Cunningham was wearing his \\"favorite jogging shoes\\" when he was found, and three crystals were in his pocket. He was known to be a crystal enthusiast and avid jogger. \\"We may never be able to tell you how he got into the river,\\" O'Connor said. An autopsy confirmed that Cunningham drowned. The death was later ruled a suicide by drowning after toxicology reports were completed. == Personal struggles == === Medical issues === According to investigators, Cunningham's parents informed them that he was taking medication for a chronic disease, but did not provide details about the disease or when he was diagnosed. ==== Sexuality ==== Cunningham's best friend, Nell Reed, who lives in Texas, told police that Cunningham had struggled with his sexuality, and had had a “breakdown” back in 2010. “She said that Tim talked to her about his feelings toward men and that he didn’t consider himself gay,” the case file states. However, Cunningham told Reed that he had recently gotten back in touch with an old classmate from Morehouse College. “She said the person had been coming to Tim’s house and that Tim began to question whether the person was playing with his feelings,” police said. The classmate told investigators that he had subsequently blocked Cunningham's number. “He said he didn’t want to be confrontational because they moved in the same social circles but it was obvious to him that Mr. Cunningham was making light advances,” police wrote in the investigative file. On Feb. 9, Cunningham saw his former classmate on a date with a woman, and the two shook hands. Cunningham invited the man to go out for breakfast the next morning, but he declined. Cunningham's sister stated, however, that she believed Cunningham was interested in two female coworkers. == Impact on family == “I feel like I’m in a horrible ‘Black Mirror’ episode,” his sister, Tiara Cunningham, told the New York Times, referencing the dystopian sci-fi television show. “I’m kind of lost without him, to be quite honest.” She told the Washington Post that she speaks with her brother often, but their conversation Feb. 12 left her concerned. “He sounded not like himself,” she said. He did not reply to a text message she sent later, and their mother, Tia-Juana Cunningham, was not able reach him either. Terrell Cunningham also had concerns about recent interactions with his son, whom he described as focused on a host of professional and personal issues. “The tone and the numerous exchanges gave us reason to be concerned about Tim,” he said. “And I don’t know if it’s an instinct you have because it’s your child, but it was not a normal conversation, and I was not comfortable.” == Remembrances == On April 21, Morehouse College hosted a memorial service for Cunningham, which was attended by approximately 600 people. Cunningham had earned his undergraduate degree at Morehouse in 2004. The memorial was a celebration of Tim's life, his passion for public service, and his drive to succeed. “It wasn’t just a career or job for him,” Capt. Marcella Law with the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion told the crowd. “Tim felt that it was his calling to use his gift and change lives.” ==References== Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2018 deaths Category:American epidemiologists Category:1982 births Category:Date of death unknown Category:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention people Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Formerly missing people found dead Category:Harvard School of Public Health alumni Category:Morehouse College alumni Category:Missing person cases in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Timothy J.

Built at the Hall Brother's shipyard at Port Blakely, Washington (state), U.S.A. in 1892, she was 184 feet long with a 39-feet beam and 15.4 feet depth, and 778 tons in weight. She had three separate incarnations. Initially a four-masted schooner for the West Coast lumber trade, she was dismasted in April 1913 in a hurricane, and abandoned. Her recovered hull was sold to the Government of Fiji and fitted out with machinery becoming the suction dredge, Lady Escott. In 1917, she was made seaworthy and re-rigged as a four-masted barquentine—once again as the Lyman D. Foster—for owners based in Auckland, New Zealand. The Lyman D. Foster was last seen leaving Nukuʻalofa, Tonga on 26 March 1919 bound for San Francisco, with cargo of copra. On 29 October 1919, the vessel was posted as 'missing' by Lloyds, and remains so a century after her disappearance.thumbLyman D. Foster as a barquentine, Brodie Collection, State Library of Victoria, Photographer George Schutze (1885-1946). 363x363px == As a schooner == Port Blakely 1905. The schooner Lyman D. Foster is second from right. (Photographer. Wilhelm Hester (b.1872 d.1947), from Wilhelm Hester Photographs Collection, University of Washington) 356x356px The Lyman D. Foster was built at the Hall Brother's shipyard at Port Blakely, Washington (state), U.S.A. in 1892 as a four-masted schooner. She was named after the son of Samuel Foster, a provision merchant from San Francisco who invested in vessels. She was used primarily to carry lumber from the US West Coast to Australia, and coal and other cargoes on the return journey, but visited other ports in the Pacific, including Suva, Honolulu, and Shanghai, typically carrying lumber on the outbound leg. She was owned by G. E. Billings of San Francisco, and flew the flag of the United States of America. === Voyages === ==== Murder of Captain Dreyer (1896) ==== The Lyman D. Forster left Puget Sound on December 22, 1895, laden with lumber, for Shanghai. On 25 February 1896, Captain Dreyer was suddenly attacked by the cook, without warning. Except for that, there are differences between the two versions of what happened.Port Blakely 1904. The Lyman D. Foster is the four-masted schooner on the left. (Photographer. Wilhelm Hester (b.1872 d.1947), from Wilhelm Hester Photographs Collection, University of Washington) In one version—widely reported in Australia newspapers and said to have been reported via the steamer Tsinan—when the captain entered the donkey-room at 9:30 a.m., the cook attacked the captain with the galley axe. The steward went to the captain's assistance, and in trying to wrest the axe out of the cook's hands, was also cut in several places about the head. The cook then suddenly drew a revolver, and shot the captain twice in the left breast. The captain ran on deck, and informed the mate, who armed himself with a pair of handcuffs and revolver. The cook dodged about the galley and attacked another sailor with his axe, cutting him in about eight different places. The mate fired two shots into the galley. In the meantime, the cook soaked the gallery in kerosene and set fire to it. The cook was then subdued, handcuffed, and tied to the main mast. Using the pumps, the fire was extinguished. When the crew returned on deck, they found the cook had untied the rope with which he had been secured and, before anyone could catch him, he said \\"Goodbye,\\" and committed suicide by jumping overboard. Captain Dreyer was mortally wounded, and died on the following day. This version of events was also reported by the Truth (Sydney) with an explicit anti-Chinese bias. However, there was a subsequent case at the U.S. Consular Court in Shanghai (United States v. Linn and Gertzen, 1896) and - from the report in the San Francisco Call of 21 March 1896 - it is apparent that there is another, less sensational, version of events surrounding Captain Dreyer's murder. Under that other version, the cook used a carving knife to stab Captain Dreyer in the back, Dreyer died quickly, and the cook (Linn) and his assistant (Gertzen) survived to face trial for murder. The Lyman D. Foster returned to Puget Sound from Shanghai under the temporary command of the mate. ==== Captain Killman and his family ==== The next master of the Lyman D. Foster was Captain Daniel O. Killman, who retained command until the ship was abandoned in 1913. Much is known of Killman's life at sea because he wrote an autobiography \\"Forty Years Master: a life in sail & steam\\". His nickname amongst seafarers was \\"Crazy Killman\\", not so much due to his mental state but his single-minded determination. Unusually, Killman's wife, Minnie, and his daughter accompanied him on voyages. His eldest daughter, Catherine Sudden Killman (named for Killman's previous command, the barquentine Catherine Sudden), spent most of the first fourteen years of her life at sea aboard the Lyman D. Foster. During that time she visited many countries and ports. As an adult, she recalled that she had made five trips to Australia and, at the age of eight, had seen a bullfight at Mazatlan, Mexico. Captain Killman instructed his daughter while at sea and she had to study hard. She went on to become a school teacher in Tacoma. ==== Explosion (1904) ==== Although the Lyman D. Foster relied on her sails for propulsion, like many ocean-going sailing vessels of the time, she was fitted with a steam boiler and donkey-engine. This engine reduced the manual labour needed to operate the vessel, by powering winches and pumps. Leaving Puget Sound on a voyage to Sydney in 1904, the schooner was towed out from Whatcom—her loading port—and was abreast of Cape Flattery, when there was a terrific explosion. The boiler of the donkey engine had burst and completely wrecked the deck house in the vicinity. The donkey engine Itself was also smashed to pieces, one portion crashing into a lifeboat and damaging it beyond repair. The cook of the vessel was the only man hurt by the explosion. He was picked up among the wreckage, and was found to be badly scalded. The schooner immediately put back to Seattle, where the injured man was landed, and the necessary repairs made before continuing the voyage, === Wreck and abandonment === Bound from Puget Sound to Suva with a cargo of a million feet of lumber, the Lyman D. Foster was caught in a hurricane off Turtle Island, in the Lau Group, on 15 April 1913. Three eyewitness accounts of the hurricane exist. The first is a nearly contemporaneous account given by a steward from the schooner, as reported in the Daily Telegraph (Sydney) of 16 May 1913: The second account is that of Captain Killman, as reported in the Tacoma Daily Ledger of 3 August 1913—and so written just over four months after the event—which is quoted in the notes accompanying his autobiography. The third is the one written many years after the event, also by Captain Killman, which is included in his autobiography. The three accounts differ only slightly and are aligned concerning the sequence of events. The hurricane struck the Lyman D. Foster between noon on 15 April 1913, when the wind began steadily increasing in force, and the following early morning. According to Captain Killman, the first damage to the ship occurred at around 9:00 p.m. when the a foresail blew away, and around 10:30 p.m. waves began breaking over the deck of the ship. The schooner was carrying a portion of its cargo of lumber on the deck. Waves breaking over the deck shifted this deck-cargo and soon carried it over the sides of the ship. Approximately a third of the cargo was lost. in this way. Next, the main-mast broke in two and the loose part went over the side, unfortunately tearing way the chainplates in the process. The damage put great strain on the fore-mast, which also broke. The mizzen-mast broke next and—relatively gently—came to rest on the deck, but in doing so damaged the steering gear. By the morning, the rudder was gone. The crew had no sleep that night but did manage to cut away the broken mizzen-mast. Daylight revealed the extent of the damage; all the masts, the rudder and all the boats had been lost, together with a third of the cargo. The schooner was still afloat, but only just. The ship had taken on a lot of water. She had drawn 17-feet when leaving port fully laden but was now drawing 22-feet and so sitting very low in the water. None of the crew of eleven was seriously injured. With no land in sight and no life-boats, the crew had no immediate choice but to stay with the floating hulk of the Lyman D. Foster, despite the risk that swelling of the wet lumber cargo would damage the hull. They did however still have some charts—they were able to establish that they were drifting toward Fiji—some canned-meat and canned-fruits, and the remainder of the cargo of lumber. They also had 800 gallons of fresh water on board. Captain D. O. Killman and the other ten members of the crew built two makeshift scows, using wood from the cargo and nails and other materials that they retrieved from the ship. They caulked the scows using rope and molten beeswax and made some sails. The crew sighted a steamer but that ship did not see them, possibly because, without masts and low in the water, the Lyman D. Foster would not be visible at a distance. On 1 May 1913, an island was sighted about 20-miles distant and it was decided that this was their best opportunity. The ship was abandoned at 8a.m. and it took the rest of the day to reach the island of Kabara—pronounced [kamˈbara]. Both scows were in great peril crossing the coral reef to reach the calmer water of the island's lagoon The scow under Captain Killman reach land first. the second one under the mate arrived only after darkness fell and then only thanks to some Fijians from Kabara who assisted it across the reef in darkness. All the crew of the Lyman D. Foster had survived their ordeal by safely reaching Kabara. From there they proceeded to Levuka by cutter, arriving on 5 May 1913. After reaching Australia aboard a steamer, Captain Killman accepted command of the schooner H.K.Hall in Sydney. === Salvage and sale === Once the Lyman D. Foster had been abandoned by its captain and crew, it became possible for other ships to attempt to recover the ship. The Lyman D. Foster, towed by the Union Co. steamer Waipori, arrived at Suva on 13 May 1913. She had been anchored at the island of Totoya after having been recovered on 4 May 1913 and towed to that island by the inter-insular steamer Ripple. The tow had been difficult as the Lyman D. Foster handled badly with its damaged rudder and was carrying water as well as the remaining part of her cargo of lumber. The owners of the Ripple claimed salvage. This was disputed by the master of the Lyman D. Foster on the grounds that the recovery had taken place inside territorial waters, and so the Ripple's owners were only entitled to a reasonable towage fee. In the meantime, the Receiver of Wrecks under a colonial ordinance, sold the salvaged cargo but retained the proceeds until the interested parties arrived at an understanding or obtained a decision from the Court. The hull of the Lyman D. Foster was bought by the Government of Fiji, for a bargain price of £240 at auction, with the remaining cargo sold for £4,244. Government engineers had identified a means of docking her locally by a temporary modification to the slip. Her owners had thought that she was too big to place on the slip at Suva, and it would have been very costly to send her to Sydney to be docked. == As the dredge Lady Escott == A dredge was needed for harbour improvement works and land reclamation at Suva. When Mr. C. W. Harris, engineer in charge of the Suva harbour works, saw what remained of the Lyman D. Foster in Suva, he decided that she was suitable for the purpose, and bought the vessel for the Fiji Government. The hull was docked on the slip in Suva, found to be in good condition, repaired, and fitted out with machinery, to become the suction dredge known as the Lady Escott. The dredge was named for the wife of the then Governor of Fiji, Sir Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott. By 1916, the shipping losses during World War 1 had resulted in a huge increase in the value of ship's hulls and, when the government no longer needed the dredge, it was put up for sale by tender. By June 1917, the dredge had been sold to the Kaipara Steamship Company of Auckland, New Zealand. In the 1920s, there was a Fiji Government yacht also named after Lady Escott. The second 'Lady Escott' foundered on 11 January 1930, after breaking its moorings in a storm. == As a barquentine == The Union Company steamer Karori towed the hulk 1200 miles from Suva to Auckland, arriving in August 1917. While under tow, the hulk was in the charge of Captain John Francis Place, an early European settler of Fiji. The hulk was in the Calliope Dock by late September 1917. The dredging machinery was removed and—once again named the Lyman D. Foster—the vessel was made seaworthy again. She was fitted with the four masts from the American schooner E. B. Jackson, which went ashore at the entrance to Apia Harbour and became a total wreck. It was planned to replace the fore-mast with an iron mast—in good condition—taken from the old ship America. The Lyman D. Foster was re-rigged as a four-masted barquentine. The newly rigged barquentine left Auckland and returned from San Francisco with a cargo of 'case-oil', arriving in Auckland on 5 July 1918. On this first voyage as a barquentine, her master was Captain Andrew J. Lockie, a New Zealander, who later commanded the ill- fated SS Canastota. The Lyman D. Foster left Auckland again on 5 August 1918, to pick up a cargo of copra from Tonga, which she reached on 24 August 1918, bound for San Francisco. She left San Francisco on 12 December 1918 and completed her second voyage on 29 January 1919, when she returned to Auckland. On the second voyage, the master was Captain Frederick Ferdinand Nilsson, a Swedish-born experienced master, who was some years earlier the master of the barque Manurewa (later lost with all hands in April 1922). Nilsson resided with his wife and family at Stanley Point in Auckland, New Zealand. == Disappearance and Aftermath == The Lyman D. Foster left Auckland on 1 March 1919, on her third voyage as a barquentine, under the command of Captain Nilsson. She called at Nukuʻalofa, Tonga, to pick up a cargo of copra, a material known for its propensity to spontaneously combust. On 26 March 1919, the ship left Nukuʻalofa, bound for San Francisco, and was never heard from again. At the time of her disappearance, her crew was 12 men. As sailing ships relied upon the prevailing weather and could not reliably maintain a set speed, initially, it was thought that the Lyman D. Foster had been becalmed. When ships began to arrive in San Francisco that had left Tonga well after the Lyman D. Foster, it became apparent that the Lyman D. Foster had been lost with all hands. The Lyman D. Foster was posted as 'missing' by Lloyds, on 29 October 1919, and remains so a century after her disappearance. No trace of her was ever found. The wages of the crew—£175 3s.—were still owing and it was necessary to determine a date for the loss of the ship in order that those wages could be paid to the dependents of the crew members. The Auckland Magistrate's Court sat on 23 November 1920 to determine the matter.

Xp11.2 duplication is a genomic variation marked by the duplication of an X chromosome region on the short arm p at position 11.2, defined by standard karyotyping (G-banding). This gene-rich, rearrangement prone region can be further divided into three loci - Xp11.21, Xp11.22 and Xp11.23. The duplication could involve any combination of these three loci. While the length of the duplication can vary from 0.5Mb to 55 Mb, most duplications measure about 4.5Mb and typically occur in the region of 11.22-11.23. Most affected females show preferential activation of the duplicated X chromosome. Features of affected individuals vary significantly, even among members of the same family. The Xp11.2 duplication can be 'silent' - presenting no obvious symptoms in carriers - which is known from the asymptomatic parents of affected children carrying the duplication. The common symptoms include intellectual disabilities, speech delay and learning difficulties, while in rare cases, children have seizures and a recognizable brain wave pattern when assessed by EEG (electroencephalography). == Symptoms and signs== Information on the clinical symptoms and features is taken from the Human Phenotype Ontology database and the Unique database. All affected individuals needn't show all the symptoms. Some of the most noted features are: * Intellectual and Learning Disabilities * Speech delay * Early puberty * Significant weight and height problems * Lower-extremity anomalies (anomalies of the legs and/ or feet) * Epileptic Seizures * Unusual pattern of EEG with centro-temporal focal spike waves in children * Minor facial features === Intellectual and Learning Disabilities === Among people who need support with their learning, at least 3% are believed to carry the duplication. It is noted that affected members of the same family with the same Xp11.2 microduplication generally have similar learning profiles. Children with small duplications of 0.5-1.3 Mb seem to have a mild learning difficulty, while others with the typical duplication of around 4.5 Mb generally have a borderline, mild or moderate learning disability. An extreme case with a very large duplication of 55 Mb has shown to have a severe intellectual disability. === Speech Delay === Speech is very commonly affected and usually the first sign. Both speech and comprehension seem to be affected, to various degrees of extent. Low facial muscle tone underlies difficulty in making certain sounds of speech. Nasal or hoarse voice are also observed. Babies are known to be unable to suck from breast in their infancy due to weak facial muscles. === Early Puberty === Early puberty occurs in 80% of the affected children or adults, with girls starting their menstrual cycles as early as age 9 and boys showing signs of puberty at age 8.5. One boy from Unique had completed puberty by age 13. === Weight problems === Affected children show tendency to be overweight. This might indicate metabolism issues. === Lower-extremity Anomalies === Anomalies of lower limbs or feet are common in people with an Xp11.2 duplication, affecting about 71% cases. Features include flat feet, arched feet (pes cavus), clubfoot (talipes), narrow feet, webbed or joined toes/fingers (syndactyly), 5th finger clinodactyly, 5th toe hypoplasia, and tapering fingers. === Unusual EEG Pattern === A typical pattern of electrical activity in the brain of affected children, described as ‘subclinical seizures’ has been noted. A peculiar electroencephalographic pattern characterized by rolandic-like spikes and/or continuous spike wave during slow sleep (CSWS), also called centro-temporal focal spike, exists in childhood. === Minor Facial Features === The common unusual features include a short or flat groove between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), a large, high or deep nasal bridge, bushy eyebrows and/or uni-brow (synophrys), and thin lips. ==Cause == Using array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) to screen 2,400 individuals with isolated or syndromic mental retardation for copy number variation, Giorda et al. (2009) identified 8 (0.33%) unrelated individuals, 2 males and 6 females, with a microduplication at chromosome Xp11.23-p11.22. The rearrangement was familial in 3 patients. A female patient shared a 4.5-Mb duplication with her affected mother and sister, and an unrelated male patient shared a 4.5-Mb duplication with his affected mother and sister. A third unrelated male inherited a smaller 0.8-Mb duplication from his unaffected mother. Three additional individuals had de novo 4.5-Mb duplications, and 2 more had partially overlapping de novo 6.0- and 9.2-Mb duplications. Paternal origin of the duplication was demonstrated in all de novo female cases. Six affected females had selective inactivation of the normal X chromosome, whereas 3 had random X inactivation. Breakpoints could be identified in 8 individuals. The recurrent duplication was flanked distally by a segmental duplication (D-REP at 47.8-48.2 Mb) containing a cluster of genes and pseudogenes of the synovial sarcoma X breakpoint (SSX) and proximally by a complex repeat (P-REP at 52.1-53.1 Mb) rich in SSX, melanoma antigen and X antigen (XAGE) genes. Sequence analysis of the junctions demonstrated that the recurrent 4.5-Mb duplications were mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) or Alu-mediated recombination. The majority of these recombinations occurred between flanking complex segmental duplications. Region of duplication and copy number variation can be further confirmed by Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) and PCR. == Genetics == The duplication at Xp11.2, especially the Xp11.22-11.23 region is syndromic and is implicated in X-linked mental retardation. The chromosomal duplication can be de novo or familial. Familial carriers of small duplication (<1 Mb) show X-linked recessive inheritance. All other affected individuals with larger duplication present dominant expression and comparable clinical phenotypes irrespective of sex, duplication size, and X-inactivation pattern. Xp11.22 comprises approximately 5 Mb of DNA (chrX:49,800,001–54,800,000, hg19). A number of pathogenic deletions and duplications involving Xp11.22 have been described in individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability and/or autism. These phenotypes have been attributed to changes in the copy number of several genes including HUWE1, KDM5C, IQSEC2, TSPYL2, SHROOM4, PHF8 and FAM120C. === HUWE1 === The HECT, UBA and WWE domain-containing protein 1 (HUWE1) is a HECT family ubiquitin ligase located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22 with growing genetic links to cancer and intellectual disability. Expression of the HUWE1 gene is found in several mouse tissues including cortex, hippocampus, tongue, eye, kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and fibroblasts. Increased copies of HUWE1 are associated with non-syndromic intellectual disability. Missense mutations in HUWE1 occur in multiple families with intellectual disability, including families with Juberg-Marsidi- Brooks syndrome. Patients with missense mutations in HUWE1 share clinical features with patients with a duplication of HUWE1. This suggests both increased and decreased HUWE1 function could be associated with intellectual disability, but evidence from an in vivo model system supporting or refuting this possibility remains absent. === KDM5C === KDM5C (Lysine-Specific Demethylase 5C) also known as jumonji, A/T-rich interactive domain 1C (JARID1C) is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22-p11.21. The gene encodes a 1560 amino-acid protein that belongs to the JARID1 subfamily of Arid DNA- binding proteins. The protein possesses H3K4me3-specific demethylase activity and is shown to function as a transcriptional repressor through the RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST) complex. The mutations in KDM5C cause Claes-Jensen type syndromic X-linked Intellectual Disability characterized by moderate-to-severe ID, speech abnormalities and other clinical findings such as seizures and aggressive behavior in some individuals. There is also a report of a mutation in a patient with autism spectrum disorder. A study showed that Kdm5c-knockout mice exhibit adaptive and cognitive abnormalities similar to those in human X-linked intellectual disability and concluded that histone methylation dynamics sculpt the neuronal network. === IQSEC2 === IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 (IQSEC2), also known as BRAG1 or IQ-ARFGEF, is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22 and encodes guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins (ARFGEF). It is expressed in the neurons and is involved in cytoskeletal organization, dendritic spine morphology, and excitatory synaptic organization. Mutations in IQSEC2 are widely associated in cases of X-linked non-syndromic mental retardation, with some carrier females reported with learning disabilities. This gene is known to play a significant role in the maintenance of homeostasis within the neural environment of the human brain. A change of guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity may influence the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and neuronal development in the brain by reduced activation of the ARF6 substrate or a defect in the GTP- binding activity. Two intragenic duplications predicted to cause termination mutations on the X-chromosome involving IQSEC2 were identified in two de novo cases, and one nonsense mutation was described in three additional male patients presenting severe intellectual disability and additional clinical features including neonatal hypotonia, delayed motor skills, seizures, strabismus, autistic-like behavior, stereotypic midline hand movements, microcephaly, little-to-no walking, little-to-no language skills, significant behavioral issues, and mildly abnormal facial features. A novel de novo mutation in the IQSEC2 gene identified through diagnostic exome sequencing showed significant developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, vision impairments, plagiocephaly, autistic-like features, absent language skills, and abnormal MRI findings. IQSEC2 gene plays a larger role in the cause of X-linked cognitive impairment than previously thought. Additional consideration is warranted with regards to the syndromic nature of its phenotypic association. === TSPYL2 === Testis-Specific Protein Y-encoded (TSPY) Like 2 (TSPYL2) codes for a member of the TSPY-like/SET/nucleosome assembly protein-1 superfamily and is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22. The encoded protein is localized to the nucleolus where it functions in chromatin remodeling and as an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression. Consistent with a possible role for Tspyl2 pathways in neurodevelopment, Xp11.2 microduplication incorporating the TSPYL2 locus has been reported in male patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. === SHROOM4 === Shroom Family Member 4 (SHROOM4), also known as KIAA1202, encodes a member of the APX/Shroom family, which contains an N-terminal PDZ domain and a C-terminal ASD2 motif. It is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22 and is mainly associated with the Stocco dos Santos X-linked mental retardation syndrome characterized by cognitive disabilities. The encoded protein may play a role in cytoskeletal architecture. Symptoms of SHROOM4 gene mutations in the original family described by Stocco dos Santos include severe intellectual disability, bilateral congenital hip luxation and short stature. The SHROOM4 gene was also found to be disrupted in two unrelated females with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Other features included delayed or no speech, seizures, kyphosis and hyperactivity. Carrier females displayed seizures and depression. No mutations in SHROOM4 were identified in more than 1000 control X chromosomes. == See also == X-linked Intellectual Disability == References == == External links == * NCBI Map Viewer Category:Rare genetic syndromes Category:Genetic diseases and disorders ","title":"Xp11.2 duplication"},{"id":"56709443","text":"The Africa Volleyball Championship for Clubs Winner's Cup is an annual international club handball competition run by the African Volleyball Confederation.

In terms of foreign-policy, Roosevelt for years had developed a system whereby he made all the major decisions.Warren F. Kimball, \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt and World War II,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 34#1 (2004) pp 83-99. online Secretary of State, Cordell Hull was relegated to ceremonial roles.Julius W. Pratt, \\"The Ordeal of Cordell Hull.\\" Review of Politics 28.1 (1966): 76-98. online Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. had the loudest voice in financial matters, and was deeply engaged in foreign policy, especially regarding Lend Lease, China, Jews and Germany. Although Roosevelt himself was quite pragmatic about moral issues, the image he presented to outsiders, especially the British, grated on their sensibilities. British foreign minister Anthony Eden told his war cabinet, \\"Soviet policy is amoral; United States policy is exaggeratedly moral, at least where non-American interests are concerned.\\" Robert Rhodes James, 'Anthony Eden: A Biography (1986) p 264 In military affairs, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was headed by Admiral William D. Leahy, a close personal friend of the president for decades. It dealt directly with their British counterparts in a new organization, the Combined Chiefs of Staff, which was based in Washington. Military decisions were made through the joint Chiefs and the combined chiefs, and they issued the orders to the theatre chiefs. The chiefs were in command of all Allied forces in their geographical zone. This was a new concept in military history, one promoted by General Marshall and accepted reluctantly at first by the British. In terms of British-American military teamwork, the key theaters were the Mediterranean and the West European--SHAEF. US general Dwight D. Eisenhower Headed the Mediterranean Theater 1943-44, then moved to SHAEF.Forrest Pogue, The Supreme Command (1954) pp 56-65 online Historians have always paid special attention to the Roosevelt-Churchill friendship. They also have explored how the two men dealt with Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator.Herbert Feis, Churchill-Roosevelt-Stalin: The War they waged and the Peace they sought (1957).William Hardy McNeill, America, Britain, and Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941-1946 (1953) Roosevelt and Churchill met in person 11 times. They exchanged 1700 cables and letters and they even made some international phone calls. Roosevelt also sent top aides, especially Harry Hopkins and to a lesser extent W. Averell Harriman.Robert E. Sherwood, Roosevelt and Hopkins (1948) Harriman accompanied Churchill to the Moscow Conference in 1942 to explain to Stalin why the western allies were carrying out operations in North Africa instead of opening the promised second front in France. Harriman was appointed as Ambassador to the USSR in 1943.W. Averell Harriman, Special Envoy to Churchill and Stalin, 1941–1946 (1975). Churchill ran a coalition government, with all parties represented. He dominated his War Cabinet. Clement Attlee, the leader of the Labour party, was Deputy Prime Minister and handled practically all domestic affairs. He did so very quietly, usually backstage. Churchill, like Roosevelt, relied on charisma and a very strong public image, to rally public opinion. Churchill handled all the top foreign policy decisions himself, with his Foreign Minister Anthony Eden taking charge only of lower visibility issues.James, Anthony Eden (1986) p 247 Churchill made himself Ministry of Defence, And repeatedly interfered and reshaped and argued with his chiefs of staff. Historians generally agree with the quality of Churchill's wartime leadership, often emphasizing his remarkable success in obtaining American support. Richard Wilkinson, who is more critical than most historians, nevertheless argues: :No one else in Britain could have approached Churchill's achievement in winning the support of President Roosevelt and his fellow citizens....He displayed a profound and sincere admiration for America. His courtship of Roosevelt was a marvellous mixture of flattery, bonhomie, and the reiteration of those values which the USA and Great Britain shared and therefore of the threat which Nazism posed to both democracies. Churchill appealed to America's interests and to her sentiments.Richard Wilkinson, \\"Winston As Warlord: A Critical Appreciation.\\" History Review (2011), Issue 71, pp 26-31. The British sent two ambassadors to Washington; each achieved very positive reputations for handling American leaders and influencing American public opinion.H.C. Allen, Great Britain and the United States (1954) pp 787-89. Lord Lothian served in 1930-40. On his death Lord Halifax took charge, 1940-46. Halifax as Foreign Minister (1938–40) had been a leader of the appeasement movement before 1939, but then reversed himself and took an aggressive anti-Hitler position. The US Ambassador 1938-40 Joseph P. Kennedy was a defeatist who in 1940 warned Roosevelt that Britain was doomed. Roosevelt could not remove Kennedy because he needed Irish support in the major cities in the 1940 election, Kennedy endorsed Roosevelt then retired, to be replaced by low-key Republican John Winant, who did well in London, 1941-46.David Mayers, FDR's Ambassadors and the Diplomacy of Crisis: From the Rise of Hitler to the End of World War II (2013)Bert R. Whittemore, \\"'A Quiet Triumph': The Mission of John Gilbert Winant to London, 1941.\\" Historical New Hampshire 30 (1975): 1-11. After the declarations of war, foreign-policy issues were no longer high on the political agenda. Appeasement was dead in Britain; isolationism was dead in the United States. After the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, foreign-policy was rarely discussed by Congress, and there was very little demand to cut Lend Lease spending. In spring 1944, the House passed a bill to renew the Lend Lease program by a vote of 334 to 21. The Senate passed it by a vote of 63 to 1.H.G. Nicholas, ed., Washington Dispatches 1941-1945: Weekly Political Reports from the British Embassy (1981) pp. 113, 148, 238, 262, 338, 351, 359 ==Top level conferences== ===Atlantic Charter 1941=== Roosevelt and Churchill met secretly at Placentia Bay in Newfoundland in August 1941, and issued a policy statement that became the foundation document for the Allies who later joined the war against Germany.-- A country had to join to gain admission to the United Nations. The Atlantic Charter defined the Allied goals for the post world war. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war—no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people, self-determination; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations. Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, which became the basis for the modern United Nations. The Charter was a powerful propaganda weapon, but Churchill, profoundly committed to maintaining British Empire, claimed it did not apply to British possessions.Theodore A. Wilson, The First Summit: Roosevelt and Churchill at Placentia Bay, 1941 (1991) excerpt Churchill's insistence on full control was signaled when he did not bring along his foreign minister Anthony Eden.James, Anthony Eden p 247 ===Arcadia, 1941-42=== The Arcadia Conference was held in Washington, from December 22, 1941 to January 14, 1942, bringing together the top British and American military leaders. Churchill and Roosevelt and their aides had very candid conversations that led to a series of major decisions that shaped the war effort in 1942–1943.David Jay Bercuson and Holger H. Herwig, One Christmas in Washington: Roosevelt and Churchill forge the grand alliance (2006), online free The decision was made to invade North Africa in 1942, to send American bombers to bases in England, and for the British to strengthen their forces in the Pacific. The Conference established the Combined Chiefs of Staff, headquartered in Washington, which approved and finalized all military decisions. It also created a unified American-British- Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) in the Far East; it fared poorly. Finally the conference drafted the Declaration by United Nations, which committed the Allies to make no separate peace with the enemy, and to employ full resources until victory.William Hardy McNeill, America, Britain and Russia: Their Cooperation and Conflict 1941–1946 (1953) pp 90–118 ===Quebec Conference, 1943=== At the Quebec Conference, 1943 held in Canada in August 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and the Combined Chiefs plotted strategy against Germany. They began planning the invasion of France, codenamed Overlord using a report by the Combined Chiefs. They also discussed an increase of the bombing offensive against facilities Germany was using in France and the Low Countries. They decided to continue the buildup of American forces in Britain prior to an invasion of France. Churchill kept drawing attention to the advantages of operations in the Mediterranean theatre. They agreed to use more force to force Italy out of the war, and to occupy it along with Corsica. Military cooperation was close and successful. The Prime Minister of Canada was the host, but no Canadians attended the secret meetings.Charmley. Churchill's Grand Alliance: The Anglo-American Special Relationship 1940–57 (1996) ===Casablanca Conference 1943=== From January 14–24, 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill and the Combined Staff met in Casablanca, Morocco. They decided on the major Allied strategy for 1943 in Europe, especially the invasion of Italy and planning for the invasion of France. They blended British and American offensive concepts.Brian P. Farrell, \\"Symbol of Paradox: The Casablanca Conference, 1943.\\" Canadian Journal of History 28.1 (1993): 21-40. At Roosevelt's demand, they agreed on a policy of \\"unconditional surrender.\\" This policy uplifted Allied morale, but it also made the Nazis resolve to fight to the bitter end.Alan F. Wilt, \\"The Significance of the Casablanca Decisions, January 1943,\\" Journal of Military History (1991) 55#4 pp 517–529 in JSTOR A major problem was to establish a working relationship between the two main French allies, Henri Giraud, the French high commissioner in North Africa, and General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French. Roosevelt strongly disliked de Gaulle, while Churchill championed him. The final decision was to split control of liberated French areas between the two Frenchmen. By 1944, de Gaulle prevailed, but he never forgave Roosevelt and always distrusted Anglo- Saxon collaboration as hostile to French interests.Arthur Layton Funk, \\"The 'Anfa Memorandum': An Incident of the Casablanca Conference.\\" Journal of Modern History 26.3 (1954): 246-254. online ==Lend Lease== The Americans spent about $50 billion on Lend Lease aid to the British Empire, the Soviet Union, France, China, and some smaller countries. That amounted to about 11% of the cost of the war to the U.S.. It received back about $7.8 billion in goods and services provided by the recipients to the United States, especially the cost of rent for American installations abroad. Lend Lease aid was usually not dollars that the recipient could use for any purpose.The total of dollars given to the British Empire for small war-related purchases was $588 million. Allen (1946) p 253. Instead it was supplies and services counted by the dollar value of military and naval munitions as well as civilian supplies such as freighters, oil, food, chemicals, metals, machinery, rent and shipping services. The total given to the British Empire, 1940-45 was $30.0 billion. This includes supplies to India, Australia, and the other dominions and colonies. Russia received $10.7 billion, and all other countries $2.9 billion.Allen (1946) p 250. The question of repayment came up, and Roosevelt repeatedly insisted the United States did not want a postwar debt problem of the sort that had troubled relations after the first world war. A small fraction of goods that were still useful – such as merchant ships – were returned to the United States. The recipients provided bases and supplies to American forces on their own soil. The cost, including rents, was called \\"Reverse Lend Lease\\", that is, aid given to the United States. It came to $7.8 billion overall, of which 86% came from the British Empire.Allen (1946) p 258, 260; McNeill p 781. Canada operated a similar program on behalf of Great Britain, and Britain itself operated a similar one for the Soviet Union. In terms of repaying Washington after the war ended, the policy became one of fair shares. In the end, no one paid for the goods it received, although they did pay for goods in transit that were received after the program ended . Roosevelt told Congress in June 1942:McNeil, America, Britain and Russia (1953 pp 137-50. : The real costs of the war cannot be measured, nor compared, nor paid for in money. They must and are being met in blood and toil.... If each country devotes roughly the same fraction of its national production to the war, then the financial burden of war is distributed equally among the United Nations in accordance with their ability to pay. ==Military cooperation== Combined Chiefs of Staff in Quebec – August 23, 1943. Seated around the table from left foreground: Vice Adm. Lord Louis Mountbatten, Sir Dudley Pound, Sir Alan Brooke, Sir Charles Portal, Sir John Dill, Lt. Gen. Sir Hastings L. Ismay, Brigadier Harold Redman, Comdr. R.D. Coleridge, Brig. Gen. John R. Deane, General Henry Arnold, General George Marshall, Admiral William D. Leahy, Admiral Ernest King, and Capt. F.B. Royal. The Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) was the supreme military staff for the United States and Great Britain during World War II. It set all the major policy decisions for the two nations, subject to the approvals of Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D Roosevelt. It controlled forces from all the Allied nations in all theaters, including the Pacific, India and North Africa. Representatives of allied nations were not members of the CCS. Instead the usual procedure included consultation with \\"Military Representatives of Associated Powers\\" on strategic issues. ===Technical collaboration=== Technical collaboration was close, as the two nations shared secrets and weapons regarding the proximity fuze and radar, as well as airplane engines, Nazi codes, and the atomic bomb.Paul Kennedy, Engineers of Victory: The Problem Solvers Who Turned The Tide in the Second World War (2013)James W. Brennan, \\"The Proximity Fuze: Whose Brainchild?,\\" U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings (1968) 94#9 pp. 72–78. ==India== Serious tension erupted over American support for independence for India, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected.Andrew N. Buchanan, \\"The War Crisis and the Decolonization of India, December 1941–September 1942: A Political and Military Dilemma.\\" Global War Studies 8#2 (2011): 5-31. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism.Kenton J. Clymer, \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt, Louis Johnson, India, and Anticolonialism: Another Look.\\" Pacific Historical Review 57#3 (1988): 261-284. online The politically active Indian population was deeply divided.Yasmin Khan, The Raj at War: A People's History of India's Second World War (2016) One element was so insistent on the expulsion of the British, that it sided with Germany and Japan, and formed the Indian National Army (INA) from Indian prisoners of war. It fought as part of the Japanese invasion of Burma and eastern India. There was a large pacifist element, which rallied to Gandhi's call for abstention from the war; he said that violence in every form was evil. There was a high level of religious tension between the Hindu majority and the Muslims minority. For the first time the Muslim community became politically active, giving strong support for the British war effort. Over 2 million Indians volunteered for military service, including a large Muslim contingent. The British were sensitive to demands of the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, since it needed Muslim soldiers in India and Muslim support all across the Middle East. London used the religious tensions in India as a justification to continue its rule, saying it was needed to prevent religious massacres of the sort that did happen in 1947. The imperialist element in Britain was strongly represented in the Conservative party; Churchill himself had long been its leading spokesman. On the other hand, Attlee and the Labour Party favoured independence and had close ties to the Congress Party. The British cabinet sent Sir Stafford Cripps to India with a specific peace plan offering India the promise of dominion status after the war. Congress demanded independence immediately and the Cripps mission failed. Roosevelt gave support to Congress, sending his representative Louis Johnson to help negotiate some sort of independence. Churchill was outraged, refused to cooperate with Roosevelt on the issue, and threatened to resign as prime minister if Roosevelt pushed too hard. Roosevelt pulled back. In 1942 when the Congress Party launched a Quit India Movement of non-violent civil disobedience, the Raj police immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists (including Gandhi), holding them for the duration. Meanwhile, wartime disruptions caused severe food shortages in eastern India; hundreds of thousands died of starvation. To this day a large Indian element blames Churchill for the Bengal famine of 1943.John Hickman, \\"Orwellian Rectification: Popular Churchill Biographies and the 1943 Bengal Famine.\\" Studies in History 24#2 (2008): 235-243. In terms of the war effort, India became a major base for American supplies sent to India, and Lend Lease operations boosted the local economy. The 2 million Indian soldiers were a major factor in British success in the Middle East. Muslim support for the British war effort proved decisive in the British decision to partition the Raj, forming of the new state of Pakistan.Eric S.

In his youth, he worked as a miner and from 1924 onwards as a book printer. He joined the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) in 1920 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1924. He served as member of the district leadership of the KPD in Western Saxony and as chairman of the workers' sports club \\"Fichte West\\" in Leipzig. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Kresse was arrested and spent time in prison and in Colditz concentration camp. After his release, he joined the resistance group around Georg Schumann. Kresse's tasks included rebuilding the underground KPD organization, making contacts with other anti-fascists and committing acts of sabotage against the war production. On 19 June 1944, Kresse was arrested again. He was sentenced to death by the People's Court in Dresden on 21 November 1944, and executed by hanging on 11 January 1945 in Dresden together with fellow resistance fighters Georg Schumann and Otto Engert. After the fall of the Nazi regime, his remains were buried in the Südfriedhof. A street in southwest Leipzig, Kurt-Kresse-Straße, was named after him in August 1945. A sporting field in Leipzig, Kurt-Kresse-Kampfbahn, also bears his name. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Politicians from Leipzig Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Communists in the German Resistance Category:Executed communists in the German Resistance Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:People executed by Nazi Germany by hanging Category:People from Saxony executed by Nazi Germany ","title":"Kurt Kresse"},{"id":"56709737","text":"Duryodhan Mahalingappa Aihole is a Bharatiya Janata Party political activist and member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.

The conservation park occupies land in sections 255 and 256 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Monbulla. It is bounded by roads on three sides - Clay Wells Road (also known as the Robe - Penola road) to the south, Searle Road to the east and Rifle Range Road to the west. A wetland called Green Swamp located in its south-west was described in 1990 as “a semi-permanent wetland of approximately ” while in its south-east corner, there is a “small disused quarry.” It originally acquired protected area status as one of two parcels of land proclaimed as a fauna sanctuary on 19 February 1970 under the Fauna Conservation Act 1964-1965 with the other parcel being located in the Hundred of Penola. On 10 September 1970, Sections 255 and 256 in the Hundred of Monbulla were proclaimed under the National Parks Act 1966 as the Penola National Park. On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the Penola Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 which repealed both of the above-mentioned acts along with other statutes concerned with conservation. The land was reported in 1990 as being previously used for grazing on the basis of the condition of the vegetation and the presence of a well at the edge of the Green Swamp. As of 2016, it covered an area of . In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant for the following reasons: > A fine reserve preserving a range of habitat types representative of the > stranded dune and swale terrain of the lower south-east of South Australia. > The Park incorporates both dune and swale with associated seasonal swamp. > Macropus rufogriseus, Trichosurus vulpecula, Tachylglossus aculeatus and > Rattus leutreolus. The diverse avifauna is augmented by a winter influx of > waterbirds. In 1990, the conservation park was described as follows: > …underlain by consolidated calcarenite dunes, overlain with red, weakly > structured sandy soils and unconsolidated stranded dunes of bleached sands > with a yellow-grey B horizon. Two large wetland areas have a marl base and > black organic soils. River red gum flats have sandy, mottled-yellow duplex > soil. In 1990, the following vegetation associations were present: # A “woodland or open woodland of brown stringybark” occupied the dunes. #A river red gum woodland with an understorey of “annual grasses and herbs and scattered shrubs” was present on “the flats associated with the wetlands.” #“Isolated stands” of swamp gum and rough barked manna gum were present on “the edges of the wetter areas.” #The north-west of the conservation park which was subject to periodic inundation supported “a large area of low heath.” #”Water-ribbons and yellow marsh flower” were present in the wetlands. As of 1990, visitation consisted of use “mainly by local residents and schools groups” and “occasional” use for “bush camping.” The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== * ==External links== *Penola Conservation Park official website *Penola Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website *Penola Conservation Park webpage on the Birds SA website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast Category:South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ","title":"Penola Conservation Park"},{"id":"56709763","text":"Underwater photographer documenting a surface supplied dive. thumb Media diving is underwater diving in support of the media industries, including the practice of underwater photography and underwater cinematography outside of normal recreational interests. Media diving is often carried out in support of television documentaries, such as the BBC series Planet Earth or movies, with feature films such as Titanic and The Perfect Storm featuring underwater photography or footage. Media divers are normally highly skilled camera operators who use diving as a method to reach their workplace, although some underwater photographers start as recreational divers and move on to make a living from their hobby. Equipment in this field is varied with scuba and surface supplied equipment used, depending on requirements, but rebreathers are often used for wildlife related work as they are normally quiet, release few or no bubbles and allow the diver a lengthy bottom time with a reduced risk of frightening off the subject. ==Applications and scope of work== Media diving is professional underwater photography and filming, and related underwater work, often in support of television documentaries or films with underwater footage. Media divers are likely to be skilled camera operators who trained as divers to expand the scope of their operations, though some have started as recreational divers and later turned professional. Media divers are the diving personnel who are employed or contracted in support of underwater media work, and include photographers, camera operators, sound and lighting technicians, journalists and presenters. They are not the divers who may be needed to prepare the underwater location using engineering and construction skills and equipment, or the use of explosives, which is classified as commercial diving work. In jurisdictions where media diving is considered commercial diving work this distinction falls away, but the code of practice to be followed may still differ according to the actual work of the dive. The media diver will prepare, clean, and maintain recording equipment such as high definition video cameras in underwater housings, with special underwater lighting, and remote cameras, plan and research dives and expeditions, dive, and shoot footage. Additional tasks commonly include maintaining generators, compressors, diving gear, boats and other diving support equipment. Rebreather skills may be necessary to reduce the impact of diver presence on wildlife, as open circuit scuba is noisy. Remotely operated underwater vehicles may be used for access to depths beyond those accessible to divers. A safety diver is required whenever performers are in the water or the action requires performers to fall into the water. ==Qualification and registration== The qualifications legally required for media diving vary considerably across the world. In some jurisdictions the occupation is simply considered to be an aspect of professional diving, and as it is an activity of employment, the practice falls under occupational health and safety legislation. In other countries there is no legislation specifying requirements. The UK HSE recognises the risks associated with media diving by issuing a code of practice for media diving, and requires media divers to have an approved qualification appropriate to the specific equipment to be used during an operation. The requirements for actors and performers taking part in a recording session or live performance may differ from those for media divers, and may include recreational diving certification, for example to EN 14153-3/ISO 24801-3 Level 3 \\"Dive Leader\\" In such operations the performers may not be included as part of the diving team for safety purposes. ==Procedural requirements== As is the case for other professional diving, the diving contractor may be required to keep an operations logbook in which certain information on the diving operation is recorded. Such information would usually include details of the diving contractor, the members of the dive team, the site location, water and weather conditions, the dive profile, the purpose of the dive, equipment used, and any reportable incidents that may have occurred during the dive. A diving project plan will be drawn up by the diving contractor based on information provided by the client, and will include a risk assessment and a detailed plan for the diving operations. ==Legal status== *The Australian/New Zealand Standard 2299 Occupational diving operations; Part 4: Film and photographic diving covers media diving in those countries, and provides requirements and guidance for producers, contractors and employees. *In the UK the status of media diving and the required qualification are specified in Media diving projects: Diving at Work Regulations 1997: Approved Code of Practice and guidance, and Diving at Work Regulations 1997: List of Approved Diving Qualifications *In South Africa, media diving is considered to be a branch of commercial diving, and requires the same qualifications for the same mode and depth range. ==References== Category:Professional diving ","title":"Media diving"},{"id":"56709786","text":"Live With Royal Northern Sinfonia is a 2017 live album featuring Lanterns on the Lake with the Royal Northern Sinfonia orchestra.

He stood out for the beauty of his voice and the purity of his singing. Nevertheless, he acted coldly and never knew how to enliven the stage. The role which made him most honoured was that of Theseus in Œdipe à Colone. Chardin was a composer, and we know of him several small operas that he wrote for the , such as: le Pouvoir de la nature, in one act, 1786; la Ruse d’amour, in one act, 1786; le Clavecin, 1787; Clitandre et Céphise, 1788. In 1787 he had l’Anneau perdu et retrouvé performed at the Comédie-Italienne. He is also known for the music of a melodrama entitled: Annette et Basile. Chardin was one of the first to set music to Florian's romances Estelle and Galatée. His oratorio Retour de Tobie was given at the Concert spirituel the same year. Chardin wrote the recitatives of Paisiello's Le Roi Théodore à Venise,Le Roi Théodore à Venise on Gallica when this work, translated by Moline, was performed at the Opera on 11 September 1787. It is also necessary to add to the list of his dramatic productions l'Amant sculpteur, opéra comique in one act which was performed at the Théâtre-comique et lyrique in 1790. When in 1792, Piis and Barré established the Théâtre du Vaudeville, they hired Chardin as a \\"teacher\\" of their young artists, and as a composer and arranger of the music for their plays. This job did not prevent Chardin from continuing to be part of the Opera staff, but it did give him the ability to place a relative, perhaps his brother, J. Chardin, in the orchestra of Vaudeville, where he played the cello parts. Having warmly embraced the party of the Revolution, Chardin was captain of an armed company of the when he died at age thirty- seven. Five days after his death, the vaudevillist Piis sent these verses about Chardin to the Journal des Spectacles : ::Opera loses a good artist, ::Music, a good harmonist, ::Vaudeville a good supporter, ::The god Comus a good guest; ::But what causes everyone a more severe pain, ::The Republic, in him, loses a good citizen. == Sources == * François-Joseph Fétis, Biographie universelle des musiciens, Paris, Firmin-Didot, 1881, (). == References == == External links == * Louis-Claude-Armand Chardin, dit Chardiny on Gallica Category:1755 births Category:1793 deaths Category:People from Fécamp Category:French opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:French operatic baritones Category:18th-century French singers ","title":"Louis-Armand Chardin"},{"id":"56709826","text":"Roxborough is a town in Trinidad and Tobago, Located at the southern shore of the Island of Tobago, it has a population of 2,089 (2011). ==History== The settlement was named after the cocoa plantation Roxborough Estate. == See also == *List of cities and towns in Trinidad and Tobago ==References== Category:Populated places in Trinidad and Tobago Category:Trinidad (island) ","title":"Roxborough, Trinidad and Tobago"},{"id":"56709839","text":"Matthew Smith Anderson (1922-2006) was professor emeritus of international history at the London School of Economics. ==Selected publications== * Britain's Discovery of Russia 1553-1815 (1958) * War and Society in Europe of the Old Regime, 1618-1789.

Luft joined the SED in 1958. From 18 November 1989 to 18 March 1990 she was economy minister in the Modrow government. From 1994 to 2002 she was member of the Bundestag for the PDS. From 1963 to 1971 Luft was registered as a Stasi informant under the code name IM Gisela. == Life == === Provenance and early years === Christa Hecht was born into a working-class family at Krakow am See, a small market town in the flat countryside to the south of Rostock in northern central Germany. Her father worked as a master machinist. at the VEB Mathias-Thesen-Werft Wismar ship building business in Wismar. Her mother was in charge of a schools kitchen. Her father was away for years at a time during the war, but after 1944 he came safely home, and while she was still small the family moved to Wismar in connection with her father's work. She attended junior school in Bobitz between 1945 and 1952, and then upper school at Grevesmühlen, still in the Rostock area. Like most of her contemporaries, she joined the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend)\\" / FDJ) in 1952, remaining a member till 1964. Shortly before the end of her penultimate year at secondary school she was one of four students - two boys and two girls - picked out by the school director to complete her schooling at the prestigious Workers' and Peasants' Faculty attached to Halle University in the central part of what had become, in October 1949, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany - formerly the Soviet Occupation Zone). Her selection held out the possibility of the chance to travel abroad in the future - which in the context of the time and place meant the Soviet Union or the other fraternal socialist member states of the recently launched Warsaw Pact. It was to facilitate the possibility of international exchange that at Halle much of the teaching took place not in German but in Russian. She was also required to attend an interview before arrangements could be finalised, which from a western perspective seems to have been intended to verify her \\"political reliability\\". She was able to confirm that she had no close relatives beyond the increasingly impenetrable \\"inner frontier\\" in \\"the other Germany\\", and knew to keep her indignation to herself when asked almost casually how she felt about the church. Inwardly she thought the matter was none of the business of her interviewers, but the reply she gave, as she would recall it many years later, was restricted to the observation that she enjoyed listening to organ concerts. Before agreeing to the move she had obtained her parents' advice on it, and during her time at Halle she used to return home on the train to the north of the country regularly. She would later tell an interviewer that early on she nurtured ambitions of working in Veterinary medicine, but during her time at Halle it became clear that this was not an option: her ambition and enthusiasm switched to Economics, albeit always with a special focus on foreign trade. Passing her Abitur (school final exams) as a student at the Workers' and Peasants' Faculty in 1956 opened the way to university level education, and she enrolled as a student at the College of Foreign Trade (\\"Hochschule für Außenhandel\\") in Berlin-Slaken, then moving on to the Berlin Economics College (\\"Hochschule für Ökonomie Berlin\\"/ HfÖ) at Berlin-Karlshorst where her teachers included Helmut Koziolek, and from where she emerged in 1960 with a degree in Economics. === Staying on at the Berlin Economics College (\\"Hochschule für Ökonomie Berlin\\" / HfÖ) === Following her graduation she stayed on at the HfÖ as a research assistant, working for her doctorate which she received in 1964. Her doctoral dissertation concerned \\"The key influences of socialist international division of labour and foreign trade on the beneficial impact for societal labour (investigated using an East German example)\\" (\\" Die wesentlichen Einflüsse der sozialistischen internationalen Arbeitsteilung und des Außenhandels auf den Nutzeffekt gesellschaftlicher Arbeit (untersucht am Beispiel der Empfängerröhrenindustrie der DDR)\\"). Her supervisors were Gertrud Gräbig and Manfred Funke. Between 1964 and 1968 she stayed at the HfÖ as an academic employee, with co- responsibility for creating a new academic discipline, that of \\"socialist foreign trade\\" (\\"Leitung des sozialistischen Außenhandels\\"), under the direction of Erich Freund, the founding director back in 1954 of the \\"Foreign Trade Academy\\" (\\"Hochschule für Außenhandel\\") and co-chairman (from the East German side) of the Committee for inter-German trade. She travelled to the west with this working group in 1966 for a study visit to the Krupp heavy- industry conglomerate in Essen: they also visited Bremen for a meeting with Carl Katz, the co-chairman (from the West German side) of the Committee for inter-German trade. In 1968 Luft received her habilitation, a higher academic qualification which would have opened the way to a full-time academic career, though her own career trajectory would include a parallel political channel. Her lengthily entitled dissertation again addressed the interface between political socialism and foreign trade (\\"Zur bewussten Ausnutzung der dialektischen Einheit ökonomischer und psychologischer Marktfaktoren beim Export der DDR nach dem sozialistischen Wirtschaftsgebiet sowie nach kapitalistischen Industrie- und Entwicklungsländern - Das Wesen der Verkaufspsychologie im sozialistischen Außenhandel\\"). Her habilitation was supervised by Gertrud Gräbig and Horst Tiedtke. Remaining at the HfÖ, in 1968 Luft received a full-time teaching contract in the newly developed academic discipline, \\"socialist foreign trade\\" (\\"Leitung des sozialistischen Außenhandels\\"). Between 1967 and 1970 she worked as assistant dean (\\"Prodekanin\\") for distance learning at the Foreign Trade faculty. In 1971 she accepted a full professorship in Socialist Foreign Economics (\\"für sozialistische Außenwirtschaft \\") the HfÖ. Between 1973 and 1977 she served as director of the Socialist Foreign Economics section. She was also a regular visitor to \\"the Academy for Foreign Trade and Tourism \\"(\\"Hochschule für Außenhandel und Touristik\\") at Maribor, a city in the northern part of what was at that time known as Yugoslavia. She held a guest professorship at the academy in Maribor which was a partner institution of the HfÖ. Between 1978 and 1981 she was a deputy director of the \\"International Institute for the Economic Problems of the Socialist World System\\" (\\"Internationalen Instituts für ökonomische Probleme des sozialistischen Weltsystems\\") attached to the Moscow-controlled Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (\\"Совет экономической взаимопомощи\\" / Comecon). She was able to build on her contacts with comrade- academics from other socialist countries, representing The Institute at international gatherings and at conferences organised by the United Nations in Geneva and New York City. After returning the German Democratic Republic, between 1982 and 1987, she again served as dean in the Foreign Economics section at the HfÖ. With the Soviet Union investing heavily in modernising its own engineering and heavy industry sectors, the traditionally complementary economic relationship between the Soviet Union and East Germany was becoming more overtly competitive, and economic pressures were forcing the East German government to try and diversify its trading relationships. As a representative of the largest Economics teaching and research institution in the German Democratic Republic, Luft participated during this time in a succession of international congresses at which she made presentations: venues included Athens, Madrid and New Delhi. From 1985 Christa Luft was involved in setting up regular one and two term study visits for HfÖ students of Foreign Economics at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (\\"Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien \\"). She also initiated a collaboration programme with East European specialists at the Sorbonne (university) in Paris. Out of this there emerged a series of bilateral colloquia in Paris, Lyon and Berlin. In 1987 Christa Luft was appointed a corresponding member of the (East) German Academy of Sciences. By 1988 the HfÖ in Berlin-Karlshorst had been renamed as the Hochschule für Ökonomie Bruno Leuschner. On 28 October of that year Christa Luft was appointed rector of the institution which had by this time been the focus of her professional and academic life for three decades. The accelerating pace of social and political changes over the next year would mean that she stayed in post for slightly more than one year. ===National politics=== In 1989 Christa Luft entered politics at a time of national transition. Between 18 November 1989 and 18 March 1990 she served as first of the three vice-chair of the East German Ministerial Council and as Minister of Economics in the Modrow government. During this time she participated alongside Hans Modrow, in January 1990, in the final Comecon meeting. The meeting was held in Sofia and made the important decision to migrate member states towards a system of trade based on freely convertible currencies, and thereby implicitly put an end to the system of fixed exchange rates within the Eastern bloc. Less than a month later she was in Bonn taking part on the first and last joint cabinet meeting between the East and West German governments, again discussing currency exchange rates, this time between East and West Germany. (There was still little appreciation of the speed with which reunification could and would take place later that same year.) The first (and as matters turned out last) free and fair general election ever held in East Germany took place on 18 March 1990. One result of the new approach was that the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), struggling to reinvent itself for a democratic future as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), received only 66 of the 400 seats in the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). It was the first time since the foundation of the German Democratic Republic back in October 1949 that the SED) and its proxies had not commanded a comfortable majority in the chamber. Christa Luft was one of the 66 SED/PDS members, elected for the Karl-Marx-Stadt (previously and subsequently Chemnitz) electoral district. She served as chair of the parliamentary budget committee. Nevertheless, with her party excluded from the governing coalition under Prime Minister Lothar de Maizière, she no longer held ministerial office. The Economics Ministry now went to Gerhard Pohl of the centre-right CDU party. During her time as a national politician Christa Luft retained her links with the HfÖ, in charge of the \\"East European Economics\\" (\\"Osteuropawirtschaft\\") teaching chair till 1 October 1991, which was when the Berlin senate, a couple of days ahead of reunification, closed down the entire institution. ===After reunification=== Between 1 October 1991 and 31 October 1994 Luft was a member of the governing executive and a lecturer at the \\"Berlin Institute for International Education\\" (\\"Institut für Internationale Bildung Berlin e.V.\\") of which she was a co-founder. The focus was to educate a generation Russian speaking economics experts from Russia and the surrounding post-Soviet successor states, especially from Bulgaria and also from China. During this time she accepted a number of invitations to appear as a guest lecturer on the East German experience of political and economic transformation. Within Europe she delivered such presentations at St. Gallen, Mülheim an der Ruhr and the Free University of Berlin. Farther afield she also shared her insights in China and in Vietnam. As part of the unification process 144 members of the East German Volkskammer, including 24 of the PDS members, transferred to the enlarged Bundestag of a reunited Germany. Christa Luft was not one of them. However, she stood for election in the 1994, when the PDS experienced a modest recovery, increasing the number of its seats from 17 to 30. Luft's candidacy, which was as a \\"directly elected\\" member for the Berlin-Friedrichshain-Lichtenberg electoral district, was successful, with 44.4% of the first preference votes: between 1994 and 2002 she served as a PDS member of the Bundestag. Between 1998 and 2002 she served as chair of the PDS group in the chamber and as the party's parliamentary spokesperson on Economics and budgetary matters. === Later years === Christa Luft regularly wrote a column on politics and economics in Neues Deutschland between 2002 and 2012, in a feature that also included regular contributions from Harry Nick, Robert Kurz and Rudolf Hickel. She remains engaged as a commentator and author. == Memberships == Christa Luft has been a member of the Learned Leibnitz Society since 1993. She is a member of the German Association for East European Studies (\\"Deutsche Gesellschaft für Osteuropakunde\\") and of the OWUS (\\"(Offener Wirtschaftsverband von kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen, Freiberuflern und Selbständigen e. V.)\\"). She was the first chairperson of the OWUS. Between 2002 and 2008 Christa Luft chaired the Kuratorium (loosely, \\"board of trustees\\") of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation. For the subsequent five years, till 2013, she was an elected member of the foundation's executive committee. ==Stasi shadows== During her time as a member of the East German parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") at the end of 1989 Luft volunteered to undergo a check to see whether and how she might feature in the surviving Ministry for State Security (Stasi) files. Nothing incriminatory was identified. Luft herself had denied having had any contact with the security services. At this stage there was little appreciation of the size of the Stasi operation nor of the extent to which - despite desperate attempts during the final days of the communist régime to burn the evidence - detailed records of Stasi activities over the previous forty years had survived. Subsequently, after further delving in the Stasi archives revealed that back in 1963, when she was 25, she had signed an undertaking to provide unspecified items of information to the authorities, she stated that she had no recollection of the matter (\\"Daran erinnere ich mich nicht\\"). During the early 1990s Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski disclosed to (West) German intelligence that Christa Luft had had links with the HVA The HVA was the department of the Ministry for State Security that dealt with \\"foreign\\" intelligence. In reality it had concentrated on West Germany. Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski was a senior politician and trade official with Stasi connections in East Germany. He provided a large amount of information to western intelligence after the collapse of East German's power structure/ He said that Luft had been handled by a Stasi officer known as Manfred Süß, but this turned out to be incorrect. Luft was a member of the Bundestag between 1994 and 2002: the nature and extent of any past associations she might have had with the Stasi were naturally of interest to the parliamentary authorities. An investigation by the Parliamentary Committee for Election verification, Immunity and Procedure resulted in a careful and detailed report which was published in June 1998. It was established that between 1963 and 1971 Christa Luft had been registered under the cover name \\"IM Gisela\\" in connection with an operation undertaken by the Stasi's Main Directorate for Reconnaissance (\\"Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung\\" / HVA) section. She had been recruited shortly before receiving her doctorate. On 31 October 1963 she had signed a handwritten \\"declaration of obligation\\" statement, of the kind frequently used for informants (\\" inoffizieller Mitarbeiter\\") recruited by the Stasi. Later in 1963 she had delivered several (three) \\"background reports in support of the unmasking of an alleged western spy. However, this was only a 'dummy case' case, used to test her reliability\\". Luft never denied the existence of the assignment, although her recollections of it, at a detailed level, were differently nuanced: :\\"It was 1963. Two men came to my student lodging and showed me their identity badges. I had no idea what the badges were. They asked me: 'Is it right that you're about to receive your doctorate, and you love the college where you study and are maybe interested in staying on there?' I answered, 'Yes'. 'That is what we thought. Well, we suspect there is someone from somewhere or other in the west who is an intelligence agent who is taking a very close interest in the college. Could you maybe meet up with him sometime and see what he wants?' I was without suspicion and I was very attached to my college. [I had no sense of being pressured or blackmailed.] ... so there I was, where I had been told, in the Coffee/Milk Bar in central Berlin for the tea dance. And there he was sitting at a table .... to cut a long story short, yes. ... What was he doing there? what were his interests? he likes drinking cognac and Pipapo, that sort of stuff ....

The investigating Parliamentary Committee reported in addition that Luft had declared herself, \\"from 1965, prepared to act as a 'cover address' for receiving postal items on behalf of the Mfs. From the available papers [the enquiry could find no sign that] she ever actually had forwarded anything to them\\", however. They thought she had probably contributed by identifying people who might be recruited for MfS \\"operational work\\". The enquiry reported that \\"from the middle of 1966 till 1971, the point of formal termination on Stasi operations in connection with \\"IM Gisela\\", no documents had been provided evidencing \\"IM activity\\" by Luft. By 1995 the Stasi records had been archived and citizens had a statutory right to access them, whether for purposes of academic research or simply to understand what personal information the East German security services had held on their movements and contacts. In June 1995 Christa Luft made a personal application to the Gauck Commission (as the relevant agency was then known) to try and find out what information the Stasis had held on her. In respect of her \\"IM Gisela\\" cover name there were no significant surprises. However, she was unnerved to find out that in 1977 the security services had launched a surveillance operation (\\"Operative Personenkontrolle\\" / OPK) against her. Luft's work had given her far more access to foreigners than most East German citizens, and there had been concerns that she might betray state secrets to the West German intelligence services. She was particularly troubled to learn that in 1977 the security services had arranged to obtain a duplicate key to her apartment. The key had remained in the hands of the Stasi till the organisation dissolved in 1990. After that it had been handed over to the Stasi Records Agency with all the other papers. Luft was indignant that no one from the records agency had bothered to tell her that they were holding a copy of her front door key. == Awards and honours == * 1981 Patriotic Order of Merit in bronzeBerliner Zeitung. 28.

It was written in 1940 and published later that year by Bermann-Fischer. The English translation by H. T. Lowe-Porter was published in 1941 by Alfred A. Knopf. It was one of Mann's last novellas, followed only by The Tables of the Law in 1944 and The Black Swan in 1954. Set in India, the story is a jocular retelling of an ancient folk legend.Kontje, Todd (2011). The Cambridge Introduction to Thomas Mann, pp. 96–98. Cambridge University Press. ==Background and themes== Mann subtitled the novella An Indian Legend. He was inspired to write it after reading a book on the Indian goddess Kali by the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer in which Zimmer recounted the old folk tale which became the basis of The Transposed Heads. Mann began writing it in January 1940 and finished in August of that year. He dedicated the published work to Zimmer adding the words \\"Returned with thanks\\". Both its setting and its source marked a unique departure from Mann's oeuvre. He described it as his \\"first approach to the French surrealist sphere\\", an oblique reference to the work of Jean Cocteau whom Mann knew through Cocteau's friendship with his son Klaus. Although the tale is a tragic one, Mann recounts it in a tongue-in- cheek style.Rieckmann, Jens (2004). \\"The Gaze of Love Longing and Desire in Thomas Mann's The Transposed Heads and The Black Swan\\", pp. 245–256 in A Companion to the Works of Thomas Mann. Boydell & Brewer. According to Jens Rieckmann, despite its exotic setting, the themes of The Transposed Heads—\\"sensuality, metaphysics, entangled identities, and the problem of love and individuality\\"—were central to Mann's work. Another theme in the story is the femme fatale archetype that can also be seen in several of Mann's works, including Little Herr Friedemann and Castorp's nightmarish visions of female cannibals in The Magic Mountain. Sita, the central female character of The Transposed Heads, is a seemingly innocent girl who causes the death of both the men who love her. She becomes a human manifestation of Kali, the goddess of time and creation but also of destruction. ==Plot== Shridaman and Nanda are two young friends who are \\"little different in age and in caste, but very unlike in body.\\"Mann, Thomas (1941). The Transposed Heads (translation by H. T. Lowe-Porter), p. 5. Secker & Warburg Shridaman is a learned merchant with strong spiritual qualities and a noble face but a thin, weedy body. Nanda is a blacksmith with a strong and beautiful body but a rather ordinary intellect. Both fall in love with Sita, the daughter of a cattle-breeder. She accepts Shridaman's proposal of marriage but shortly after their wedding, she begins to wonder if she had made the wrong choice. Matters are not helped by the fact that Nanda has remained Shridaman's friend and is a frequent visitor to their house. Soon, both Nanda and Shridaman become aware of what is happening. Six months after the wedding and with Sita pregnant with Shridaman's child, they set off to visit her parents accompanied by Nanda. On the way they stop at a temple to the goddess Kali where Shridaman goes in to pray. In a fit of religious fervor he beheads himself to free Sita to marry Nanda. Nanda then enters the temple and when he finds Shridaman's corpse, he likewise beheads himself. On discovering what has happened, Sita is about to hang herself when Kali appears. She tells Sita to place the heads back on the bodies and she will bring them back to life. However, in her grief and confusion Sita had placed Nanda's head on Shridaman's body and vice versa. Each man now retains his original identity but has a new body. At first the situation seems to be going well. Sita gives birth to Samadhi, a lovable child with very poor eyesight who is nicknamed \\"Andhaka\\" (\\"Little blind boy\\"). Shridaman is pleased to have a perfect body and Nanda is pleased to have the body that has fathered Sita's child. He is also pleased that Sita is having sex with his former body. Nevertheless, they decide to consult the wise man Kamadamana as to which of the two men is actually her husband. He determines that it is the one with the head of Shridaman. In his disappointment, Nanda becomes a religious recluse. Four years have passed. While Shridaman is away on business, Sita takes her son to visit Nanda and show him the child his new body had generated. Sita and Nanda are overwhelmed by passion. On returning to an empty house, Shridaman sets off to find Nanda and Sita. He proposes to them the only solution for a situation where a woman is simultaneously in love with one man's body and another man's head. The two men are to commit suicide, and Sita is to die a ritual death on her husband's funeral pyre. This duly happens with little Samadhi-Andhaka lighting the flames. ==Adaptations== *The Transposed Heads, an opera by Peggy Glanville-Hicks (1954)Murdoch, James (2002).

He played college basketball for Molloy College in the NCAA Division II. ==Early life and college career== Morris had previously gone to high school at St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute in Buffalo, New York. During his senior year there, he was an honorable mention for the All-Western New York team, as well as be named Mr. Defense for having the best defensive abilities of the state that year. However, since he did not have any major school offer him any scholarships, he decided to go to Molloy College, where his father Patrick is an assistant coach for the basketball team. During his first two years at Molloy College, Morris provided decent numbers for the Lions, with his sophomore season having him be an East Coast Conference All-Conference Honorable Mention. Starting in his junior and senior seasons, Morris would grow into more of a star player for the college, with him being named a member for both the All-ECC Third-team and All-Met Second-team in his junior year, as well as a member of the All-ECC First-team in his senior year of college. During his senior year, he became the second-highest scorer for the team, averaging 19.9 points per game during his senior season. ==Professional career== ===Erie BayHawks (2017–2018)=== After getting undrafted in the 2017 NBA Draft, Morris would pay $150 to work out with the Long Island Nets. His workout there would lead to him getting drafted by the Erie BayHawks in the 2017 NBA G League Draft in the second round as the 41st overall pick that year. ===Atlanta Hawks (2018)=== On February 28, 2018, after multiple successful games from Morris with the BayHawks, he signed a 10-day contract with the Atlanta Hawks. Morris made his NBA debut that same day in a 107–102 win over the Indiana Pacers. In his debut, Morris recorded 2 points and 2 rebounds in 11 minutes of action. After his first 10-day contract expired, he signed a second 10-day contract with the Hawks on March 11, 2018. During that night's game, he would end up injuring his ankle, thus sidelining him for up to two weeks. Despite the injury, Morris would ultimately sign with the Hawks for the rest of the season on March 21. He was waived on July 19, 2018. ===Milwaukee Bucks (2018–2019)=== On July 22, 2018, Morris signed a deal with the Italian club Auxilium Pallacanestro Torino.

Strontium atoms (in yellow) fit inside the orbit between the nucleus (in red) and the electron (in blue) of a Rydberg atom. A Rydberg polaron is an exotic state of matter, created at low temperatures, in which a very large atom contains other ordinary atoms in the space between the nucleus and the electrons. For the formation of this atom, scientists had to combine two fields of atomic physics: Bose–Einstein condensates and Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are formed by exciting a single atom into a high-energy state, in which the electron is very far from the nucleus. Bose–Einstein condensates are a state of matter that is produced at temperatures close to absolute zero. Polarons are induced by using a laser to excite Rydberg atoms contained as impurities in a Bose–Einstein condensate. In those Rydberg atoms, the average distance between the electron and its nucleus can be as large as several hundred nanometres, which is more than a thousand times the radius of a hydrogen atom. Under these circumstances, the distance between the nucleus and the electron of the excited Rydberg atoms is higher than the average distance of the atoms of the condensate. As a result, some atoms lie inside the orbit of the Rydberg atom's electron. As the atoms don't have an electric charge, they only produce a minimal force on the electron. However, the electron is slightly scattered at the neutral atoms, without even leaving its orbit, and the weak bond that is generated between the Rydberg atom and the atoms inside of it, tying them together, is known as the Rydberg polaron. The new state of matter was predicted by theorists at Harvard University in 2016 and confirmed in 2018 by spectroscopy in an experiment using a strontium Bose–Einstein condensate. Theoretically, up to 170 ordinary strontium atoms could fit closely inside the new orbital of the Rydberg atom, depending on the radius of the Rydberg atom and the density of the Bose–Einstein condensate. The theoretical work for the experiment was performed by theorists at Vienna University of Technology and Harvard University, while the actual experiment and observation took place at Rice University in Houston, Texas. == See also == *Bose–Einstein condensates *Rydberg atoms == References == == External links == *Creation of Rydberg Polarons in a Bose Gas, original article at Physical Review Letters.

These tools use different mechanisms to bind a predetermined sequence of DNA (“target”), which they cleave (or \\"cut\\"), creating a double-stranded chromosomal break (DSB) that summons the cell's DNA repair mechanisms (non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)) and leads to site-specific modifications. If these complexes do not bind at the target, often a result of homologous sequences and/or mismatch tolerance, they will cleave off-target DSB and cause non-specific genetic modifications. Specifically, off-target effects consist of unintended point mutations, deletions, insertions inversions, and translocations. Designer nuclease systems such as CRISPR-cas9 are becoming increasingly popular research tools as a result of their simplicity, scalability and affordability. With this being said, off-target genetic modifications are frequent and can alter the function of otherwise intact genes. Multiple studies using early CRISPR-cas9 agents found that greater than 50% of RNA-guided endonuclease-induced mutations were not occurring on-target. The Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) recognizes a 20 bp target DNA sequence, which it binds and cleaves to \\"edit\\" the DNA sequence. However, target sequence binding can tolerate mismatches up to several base pairs, meaning there are often thousands of possible binding sites which present several experimental and safety concerns. In the research sphere, off-target effects can confound variables in biological studies leading to potentially misleading and non-reproducible results. In the clinical sphere, the major concerns surround the disruption of vital coding regions leading to genotoxic effects such as cancer. Accordingly, the improvement of the specificity of genome editing tools and the detection of off-target effects are rapidly progressing research areas. Such research incorporates designer nuclease development and discovery, computational prediction programs and databases, and high-throughput sequencing to reduce and anticipate mutational occurrence. Many designer nuclease tools are still in their relative infancy and as their molecular properties and in vivo behaviors become better understood they will become increasingly precise and predictable. == Mechanisms == The CRISPR-Cas9 system works as the adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea. When a virus infects the bacteria, this system incorporates segments of the viral DNA into the bacterial genome. Upon a second invasion, transcripts from these sequences direct a nuclease activity to its complementary sequence in the invading virus so as to destroy it. In order to extrapolate this method into eukaryotes in order to develop a gene editing method, a Cas9 protein, a recognition sequence RNA, and a transactivating RNA are required. The fusion of both the recognition sequence specificity CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivating RNA (tracrRNA) is commonly used in experiments and called a single guide RNA (sgRNA). It performs both functions: the first 20 nucleotides of the sgRNA are complementary to the DNA target sequence (cr function), while the nucleotides following are part of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM; tracr function). Off-targeting nuclease binding originates from a partial but sufficient match to the target sequence. Off-target binding mechanisms can be grouped into two main forms: base mismatch tolerance, and bulge mismatch. === Base mismatch tolerance === While the Cas9 specificity is believed to be controlled by the 20nt sgRNA and PAM, off-target mutations are still prevalent and could occur with as many as 3-5 base pair mismatches (out of 20) between the sgRNA and the target DNA sequence. Furthermore, sgRNA secondary structures could also affect cleavage of on-target and off-target sites. As mentioned above, sgRNA consists of a sequence (~20nt) which is complementary to the target sequences and this is followed by a PAM sequence which activates the endonuclease activity. While it was shown that 10-12 nt adjacent to PAM (called the “seed sequence”) was enough for Cas9 specificity, Wu et al. showed that in a catalytically dead Cas9 only 1-5 base pairs of seed sequence is required for specificity. This was later proven by other studies as well. The Cas9 protein binding is further affected by a number of mechanisms: * The seed sequence determines the frequency of a seed plus PAM in the genome and controls the effective concentration of Cas9 sgRNA complex. * Uracil-rich seeds are likely to have low sgRNA levels and increase specificity since multiple uracil in the sequence can introduce termination of the sgRNA transcription. * Mismatches in the 5’ end of the crRNA are more tolerated as the important site would be adjacent to the PAM matrix. Single and double mismatches are also tolerated based on how to place it. * In a recent study, Ren et al. observed a link between mutagenesis efficiency and GC content of sgRNA. At least 4-6bp adjacent to the PAM are required for a good edit. * While picking a gRNA, guanine is preferred over cytosine as the first base of the seed adjacent to PAM, cytosine as the first in the 5’ and adenine in the middle of the sequence. This design is based on stability linked to formation of G quadruplexes. * A ChIP was performed by Kim et al. showcasing that addition of a purified Cas9 along with the sgRNA caused low off target effects which means that there are more factors causing these effects. It is important to note that DNA methylation of CpG sites reduces efficiency of binding of Cas9 and other factors in cells. Therefore, there is an epigenetic link which will be explored more for the future of epigenome editing. Graphical explanation of DNA and RNA bulge. Variations within the PAM sequence can also affect sgRNA activity, in turn affecting the sgRNA itself. In commonly used Cas9 systems, the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity problems as some regions will have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. A report stated that 99.96% of sites previously assumed to be unique Cas9 targets in human exons may have potential off target effects containing NAG or NGG PAM and a single base mismatch in the seed sequence. === Bulge mismatch === Both off target sites with missing bases (or deletions) and off target sites with extra bases (or insertions) called RNA bulge and DNA bulge respectively, have effects in Cas9 specificity and cleavage activity. Lin et al. mimicked these bulges by adding and deleting bases from the sgRNA sequence such that a base deletion in the sgRNA would yield an RNA bulge and a base insertion would yield a DNA bulge. By studying the mutation rates via NHEJ, they came to the following results: * In case of pure DNA bulges, the mutations were well tolerated (i.e. Cas9 cleavage activity was still prevalent). The regions of bulge tolerance included seven bases from the PAM and the 5’ and 3’ ends of the seed sequence. This resulted in similar or slightly higher (in some cases) mutations as compared to zero bulges. * In case of purely RNA bulges, higher Cas9 activity was induced at many positions as compared to DNA bulges. This characteristic was attributed to the fact that RNA is more flexible than DNA and thus has a smaller binding penalty with RNA bulge resulting in a higher tolerance and higher off target mutations. * Higher GC content of the sgRNA sequence resulted in a higher tolerance and thus, a higher off target mutation rate. * Bulges of 2bp-5bp strikingly were more tolerant and mutation inducing than a single 2bp bulge. == Improvements == Visual depiction of CRISPR-cas9 using a wild-type SpCas9 nuclease CRISPR-Cas9 engineering improvements that reduce off-target effects through required i) co-localization (Cas9 nickases), and ii) dimerization (Fok1-dCas9) === Methods to increase specificity === The widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease is effective, however it induces unwanted off-target mutations at high frequencies. Several engineering and screening methods have been described in an effort to reduce genome-wide off- target mutations including nuclease mutation, protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence modification, guide RNA (gRNA) truncation and novel nuclease discovery. For example, in 2013, Fu et al. reported that by truncating the gRNA from <20 bp in length to 17 or 18 bp the target specificity of the nuclease increased up to 5,000 fold and mismatch occurrences above 3 bases rarely, if ever occurred. ==== Cas9 nickases ==== The spCas9 nuclease can also be mutated in a variety of ways to improve specificity and control. Nuclease domains can be mutated independently of each other into what are known as Cas9 nickases. These nucleases have one active and inactive nuclease domain which result in a complex that performs single strand cleavage. Cas9 nickases can be employed in tandem (known as paired nickases), which perform two single strand 'cuts' on alternate strands. Using this strategy both Cas9 nickases must co- localize, bind and cleave their target, which drastically reduces the probability of off-target indels. Also, the DSBs cleaved by paired nickases have long overhangs instead of blunt ends which provide improved control of targeted insertions. ==== Fok1-dCas9 and dimerization nucleases ==== As monomeric nucleases often involve high levels of off-target effects, dimerization is an attractive strategy. In a dimer system, both nucleases must bind to their individual targets or ‘half-sites’ and then interact and dimerize to initiate cleavage which greatly decreases the probability of off- target effects. A method that incorporates the reliability of dimerization- dependent FokI nuclease domains, used in ZFNs and TALENs, with the simplicity of CRISPR-cas9 has been developed. The FokI nuclease was originally found in Flavobacterium okeanokoites, and will only cleave DNA given dimerization activation. Basically, the researchers fused this nuclease to a CRISPR complex with an inactive Cas9 nuclease (Fok1-dCas9). The gRNA directs the CRISPR complex to the target site but the 'cut' is made by dimerized Fok1. It is estimated that the Fok1-dCas9 strategy reduces detectable off-target effects by 10,000 fold, which makes it effective for applications requiring highly precise and specific genome editing. ==== Nuclease mutation ==== In addition to a gRNA target, Cas9 requires binding to a specific 2-6 nucleotide sequence PAM. In commonly used SpCas9 systems the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity limitations as some regions will not have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. The PAM sequence can be edited to non-canonical NAG and NGA motifs which not only improve the specificity but also reduced off-target effects. A D1135E mutant appears to alter PAM specificities. The D1135E mutant reduces off-target effects and increases the specificity of SpCas9. An additional variant, SpCas9-HF1, also results in favorable improvements to Cas9 specificity. Several combinations of substitutions known to form non-specific DNA contacts (N497A, R661A, Q695A, and Q926A) have been identified. A quadruple substitution of these residues (later named SpCas9-HF1), has extremely low levels of off-target effects as detected by GUIDE-seq experiments. Variants such as SpCas9-HF1 and D1135E, and others like it can be combined, tested and readily added to existing SpCas9 vectors to reduce the rates of off-target mutations. Additionally, many of the engineering strategies listed above can be combined to create increasingly robust and reliable RNA-guided nuclease editing tools. Directed evolution can also be used to reduce nuclease activity on particular target sequences, leading to variants such as SpartaCas (containing mutations D23A, T67L, Y128V, and D1251G relative to wildtype SpCas9). ==== CRISPRi and CRISPRa ==== CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) have also been developed. These systems can precisely alter gene transcription at the DNA level without inflicting irreversible genetic alterations. Furthermore, by directly acting on DNA they are generally more specific and predictable compared to RNAi. Although CRISPRi/a cannot replace genome editing in all experiments, they can act as effective alternatives in some cases. CRISPRi and CRISPRa use a deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) enzyme that cannot cut DNA, but can deliver transcriptional activators and repressors to modulate desired gene expression with high precision. Currently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible. CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences. Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA. The represents a promising technology that if successful would reduce the burden of irreversible off-target mutations. == Detection == Even though one might take careful measures to avoid off-target mutations, and even if one succeeds, a confirmatory screen needs to be done in order to screen for unintended mutations. Currently there are plenty of biased and unbiased methods for such a screen and only two in vitro methods. All of these are listed below: === Targeted, exome, and whole genome sequencing === In case of normal targeted sequencing, the biased approach will yield results only for the intended area of capture, which hinders the search as no unexpected mutations will come up on the screen. While it is easy and cheap, it becomes time consuming and expensive once more target sites are added. Exome sequencing utilizes exome capture to acquire the protein coding regions of the genome. It is unbiased, however, it will not yield off target mutations in the non-coding region of the genome. In case of whole genome sequencing, the entire genome is screened for off target mutations. Currently, this method is expensive and like exome sequencing, whole genome also requires a reference genome to make inferences. === BLESS === An overview of different methods for detection of off target mutations by genome editing. A) BLESS B) GUIDE-seq C) HTGTS D) Digenome-Seq BLESS is the easiest way to detect and quantify off- target mutations by screening for DSBs in the genome. This method relies on direct in situ breaks labeling enrichment on streptavidin. Developed in 2013, BLESS is performed by ligating the DSB ends with biotin i.e. biotinylation. This is followed by separation/collection of said ligated ends using streptavidin. A linked sequence is added to the biotinylated sequences and this final mix is then sequenced to yield the position of the off target mutation. Being unbiased in nature, BLESS gives information about site of mutation within the genome rather than the proteins involved or associated with the DSBs. However, BLESS can only detect mutations at the time of experiment and not the ones which were formed earlier and were repaired. === LAM-HTGTS === Linear Amplification Mediated - High Throughput Genome Wide Translocation Sequencing, or LAM-HTGTS, is a method developed to track translocation events caused by joining between DSBs. Developed to detect off- target mutations from TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9, this technique is based on DNA repair by end joining in DSBs. Once the nuclease is added, it goes on to produce on- and off-target mutations. Along with this there is a bait sequence which also gets cleaved. Therefore, if another DSB occurs on a chromosome other than the bait sequence chromosome, both of them are joined leading to a translocation. Since the bait sequence is known, this translocated sequence is amplified with primers. In case there is no translocation, there is a restriction site within which gets cleaved in order to prevent amplification of only the bait sequence. The amplified DNA is then sequenced to study large genomic rearrangements due to off-target mutations. One drawback is that it relies on simultaneous presence of bait and another DSB. === GUIDE-Seq === Another approach to find off-target mutations due to nuclease activity is the GUIDE-Seq method. GUIDE-seq or Genome Wide Unbiased Identification of DSBs Enabled by Sequencing is based on the incorporation of double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) into DSBs via NHEJ. Its amplification is followed by sequencing. Since two primers will be used to sequence the dsODNs, the regions flanking the DSB along with the DSB will be amplified. Thus allowing mapping the off target mutation. This technique has been applied to identify all previously known off-target sites as well as new ones with frequencies as low as 0.03%. Just like BLESS, however, GUIDE-seq can only detect DSBs present at the time of study. === Digenome-Seq === One of the current in vitro methods, Digenome-Seq utilizes Cas9's property of cleaving the genome to get an unbiased profile of the entire genome. In this method, Cas9 is added to gDNA and the after effects are studied using high-throughput sequencing. Since the fragments are formed due to the same nuclease, the ends of these fragments can be mapped aligned. Two big advantages are that it can be used to study up to 10 gRNAs at once and can identify targets to frequencies as low as 0.01%. The main advantage, however, is that this method is in vitro i.e. the DSBs introduced by Cas9 will not be processed by the DNA repair machinery (unlike BLESS and GUIDE-seq) and thus will include all possible off target mutants. However, it might lead to large number of false positives as well. === CIRCLE-Seq === The latest addition to the in vitro methods in detecting off target mutations is CIRCLE-seq. Licensed by Beacon genomics (along with GUIDE-seq), CIRCLE-seq aims to remove the drawbacks of Digenome-seq such as the need for a large sample size and read depth (~400 million reads) and the high background that makes identification of low frequency cleavage events harder. It adopts a restriction enzyme independent strategy to create and select conversion of randomly sheared DNA. On cleavage, the target DNA forms a stem loop to which adaptors can be added for sequencing. While this proved possible, the other possibility yielded a fold high difference in detection/. In the second case, the sequence is cleaved using Cas9 and when it is cleaved again at the half site, a circular cut is available(which is the reason for the name CIRCLE-seq). Nearly all sites identified by circularization contain both linear detected sites and newer ones suggesting that CIRCLE-seq does not bias between breaks and obtains strong low frequency breaks as well. It further helps to sequence the break site from both sides of cleavage as compared to other methods which have only one read side. === Barcoded libraries of targets === Nucleases such as Cas9 may also be challenged in vitro by randomized libraries of targets. Adapter ligation to quantify cleaved and uncleaved library members allows for unbiased measurement of a nuclease's specificity profile. Measurement of cleavage of barcoded libraries of targets (BLT) with SpCas9 indicated that specificity profiles were guide-specific and depend on the guide sequence as well as the nuclease itself. Unbiased specificity profiles based on each particular Cas9-gRNA complex may then be used to build guide-specific predictive models for in vitro cleavage. == Significance == === Gene therapy === In order for gene editing technologies to make the leap towards safe and widespread use in the clinic, the rate of off-target modification needs to be rendered obsolete. The safety of gene therapy treatment is of utmost concern, especially during clinical trials when off-target modifications can block the further development of a candidate product. Perhaps the most well-known example of modern gene therapy is CAR-T therapy, which is used for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. To limit the rate of off-target cleavage, the therapy uses a highly specific and finely tuned TALEN, which has proven to have little-to-no background off-target interaction. CAR-T immunotherapy is an ex vivo procedure, which means that the patient's immune cells (in this case T-cells) are extracted and edited using designer nucleases. While TALEN system development is expensive and time consuming, research and engineering modifications have drastically limited their rate of off-target interaction. However, patients receiving the treatment are still monitored frequently and will be for the next 15 years so that off-target effects and immunogenic responses can be analyzed and brought into consideration as new gene therapies are brought to clinical trial. ==== CCR5 ZFN-modified autologous helper T cell trials ==== A phase I/II clinical trial enrolled 12 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to test the safety and effectiveness of administering ZFN-modified autologous helper T cells. Through targeted deletions, the custom ZFN disables the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene, which encodes a co-receptor that is used by the HIV virus to enter the cell. As a result of the high degree of sequence homology between C-C chemokine receptors this ZFN also cleaves CCR2, leading to off-target ∼15kb deletions and genomic rearrangements. The impacts of these CCR2 modifications are still not known, and to date there have been no reported side effects. However, CCR2 is known to have many critical roles in neural, and metabolic systems. === Gene Drives === Engineered gene drives using CRISPR-cas9 are currently being tested and have been proposed as strategies to eliminate invasive species and disease vectors. By genetically modifying an organism to express an endogenous sequence-specific endonuclease, a target (such as a fertility gene) can be cleaved on the opposite chromosome. A DSB at the target leads to homologous repair which effectively renders the organism homozygous for the desired target sequence. This strategy, known as a homing drive, can suppress a population by affecting a critical gene or inducing recessive sterility. However, if such a system were released into the wild, the CRISPR-cas9 system would remain function indefinitely. With every subsequent generation, off- target mutations would become increasingly likely and the effects of these mutations on a species would be stochastic. Off-target mutations could disable the suppressive qualities of a gene drive while maintaining the endonuclease expression. In such a situation there would be an increased risk of gene flow between the target species and other species likely leading to undesired outcomes. == Controversy == The increased use of genome editing and its eventual translation towards clinical use has evoked controversy surrounding the true off-target burden of the technologies. === Schaefer et al. 2017 === On May 30, 2017 a two-page correspondence article was published in Nature Methods that reported an unusually high number of off-target SNVs and indels after sequencing mice that were previously involved in an in vivo gene repair experiment. The previous experiment, completed by the same group, successfully restored the vision of blind mouse strain (rd1) by correcting the Y347X mutation in the Pde6b gene using a CRISPR-cas9 system. After completing the experiment two genetically corrected mice were whole genome sequenced and compared to control and known mouse strain genomes. Greater than 1,600 SNVs, and 128 indels were discovered, of which 1,397 SNVs and 117 indels were shared between the two edited mice, suggesting that the off-target effects were not random. Algorithms attempting to predict the location of these off-target mutations failed for an overwhelming majority of loci. In comparison, a 2016 whole exome sequencing study found 19 SNVs and 3 indels in 5 edited mice, while Schaefer et al. found 115 exonic SNVs and 9 indels in just 2 edited mice. Many experts disagreed with the paper and criticized it through journal articles and social media, suggesting that unusual CRISPR treatments were used in the initial paper and the sample size was too low for significance (n=2). Nature Methods has issued two editorial notes on the paper. Nonetheless, off- target rates are consistently found to be more frequent in vivo compared to cell culture experiments, and are thought to be particularly common in humans. == References == == External links == * Controversial CRISPR paper earns second editorial note - Retraction Watch Category:Genome editing ","title":"Off-target genome editing"},{"id":"56710054","text":"Dine Doneff (born 1965), also known as Kostas Theodorou, is a Macedonian composer and multi-instrumentalist. == Biography == Born in West Germany to Macedonian parents and raised in the northern Greek prefecture of Edessa, Dine Doneff (or Kostas Theodorou, according to his Greek citizenship name) has been active as a musician and composer since the mid-eighties. Faced with the choice between school and music, he left his home village and fled to Thessaloniki. He became a self taught musician. By the 90s he was working as an arranger, ensemble director and producer on studio recordings. Alternating between touring abroad, he joined the group Savina Yannatou & Primavera en Salonico in 2001, with four albums released by ECM; from 2002 to 2005 he taught at the Technical Education Institute of Epirus and the University of Macedonia. Later, under the fictional auspices of ‘no bizz productions’, he became the pivot, and inspiration, of “ninety nine (99)”, improvised public rehearsal performances in a small underground theatre in Thessaloniki from 2005 to 2011 involving onstage encounters between Doneff and musicians, dancers, actors, poets and visual artists. Interludes of composing for the theatre and silver screen were interspersed with forays into theatre direction and, under the name of Tome Rapovina, directing and editing short films. From 2014 to 2016, he worked as a composer and actor with the Kammerpiele in Munich and the Thalia Theater in Hamburg. As a result of his appearance as an ECM artist, Dine Doneff together with painter & photographer Fotini Potamia, founded the label “neRED music” following a suggestion of Manfred Eicher, ECM’s founder and producer.

From the corps, the Swedish Army was provided with staff for various commissary positions. The head of the corps was the Quartermaster-General of the Swedish Army. In 1966, the corps was amalgamated with the Swedish Naval Supply Service (Marinintendenturkåren) and the Swedish Air Force's quartermaster officers and formed the Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces. It was in turn amalgamated with the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps in 1973 and formed the Commissary Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces which was disbanded in 1990. ==History== Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps (Arméns intendenturkår) was formed by Royal Decree on 9 April 1880. The creation of the corps was part of the ongoing reform of the Swedish Army's administrative organization. The idea was that through a unified management lay the foundations of good recruitment and better training of administrative personnel. Head of the corps was the Quartermaster-General of the Swedish Army, who also headed the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration's Quartermaster Department which from 1943 was called the Army Administration's Commissariat Department (Arméförvaltningens intendenturavdelning) and from 1954 was called the Royal Swedish Army Supply Administration. In his capacity as chief of the corps, the Quartermaster- General had, at his side, an office or staff, which over time was reorganized and changed its name on several occasions: *1880–1893 – Generalintendentens expedition (\\"Office of the Quartermaster-General\\") *1893–1907 – Intendenturkårens huvudstation (\\"Main station of the Quartermaster Corps\\"), which included the Generalintendentens expedition (\\"Office of the Quartermaster-General\\") as well as the Intendenturkårens chefsexpedition (\\"Head Office of the Quartermaster Corps\\") *1907–1914 – Generalintendentens expedition (\\"Office of the Quartermaster-General\\") *1914–1937 – Intendenturstaben (\\"Quartermaster Staff\\"), which included the Intendenturkårens chefsexpedition (\\"Head Office of the Quartermaster Corps\\") *1937–1966 – Intendenturkåren (\\"Quartermaster Corps\\"), Chefsexpeditionen (\\"Head Office\\") At the time of the formation, the corps comprised all the personnel who handled administrative duties that belonged to the supplies in army units and stores. During the 1890s, the quartermaster staff at the General Staff and the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration's Quartermasters Department (Arméförvaltningens intendentsdepartement) were also included. Initially, the corps was regarded as civil-military, but was awarded military corps status in 1915. In order to gain entry as a member of the corps, one later required completed training in commissariat service. Quartermaster aspirants were trained from 1909 at the corps' military management course; from 1943 at the Swedish Army Quartermaster School (Intendenturförvaltningsskolan). From the corps, the army was provided with staff for the various commissary positions (regimental quartermasters and commissioners, förvaltare and others). The 1907 administrative reform distinguished certain parts of the administration from the area of responsibility of the corps (arms, buildings, healthcare, etc.). Remaining was the responsibility for camp, rations, clothing, horses, certain vehicles, fuels and accounting matters. The Defence Act of 1936 meant in this regard that the motor vehicles were completely removed from the corps. After World War II, the organization of the military administration and its staff corps' were investigated. The result was partly a coordination of the Swedish Army Supply Administration (Arméintendenturörvaltningen) with the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration's Commissariat Department (Marinförvaltningen intendenturavdelning) and the Royal Swedish Air Force Materiel Administration Commissariat Bureau (Flygförvaltningens intendenturbyrå) to the newly established Quartermaster Administration of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1963; and to a corresponding coordination of the Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps (Intendenturkåren) with the Swedish Naval Supply Service (Marinintendenturkåren) (formed in 1904) and the Swedish Air Force's quartermaster officers (which had not previously constituted a special staff corps) to a joint corps, the Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces which was established in 1966. ==Quartermaster-Generals== Quartermaster- General Hilding Kring at the last plenary session of the Royal Swedish Army Supply Administration in June 1963. The Quartermaster-General of the Swedish Army was commanding officer of the Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps and head of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration's Quartermaster Department. He was also Inspector of the Quartermaster Service Troops (Intendenturtrupperna, Int) and regarding the training of these troops, he had similar duties as other branch inspectors. In his capacity as head of the Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps and Inspector of the Quartermaster Service Troops, he was assisted most closely by personnel of the Quartermaster Staff (Intendenturstaben). *1880–1883: ? *1883–1892: Hjalmar Palmstierna *1889–1890: Christer Oxehufvud (acting) *1892–1896: Adam Thorén *1896–1904: Richard Berg *1904–1905: Knut Gillis Bildt *1905–1915: Fredrik Holmquist *1915–1926: Fredrik Frölich *1926–1935: Axel Hultkrantz *1935–1946: Helge Söderbom *1946–1957: Ivar Gewert *1957–1963: Hilding Kring *1963–1966: Folke Diurlin ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Corps of the Swedish Army Category:Military units and formations established in 1880 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1966 Category:Quartermasters Category:Military administrative corps of Sweden ","title":"Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps"},{"id":"56710096","text":"Bieberite (CoSO4 · 7H2O) is a pinkish red colored sulfate mineral high in cobalt content.

While her work was primarily in weaving, her best known piece is the puppet Lamb Chop. ==Early life and education== Stein was born as Ethel Levy on June 22, 1917, to Tanya Levy in New York City. She was raised by her aunt and Uncle, Ella and Abbo Ostrowsky, in Croton-on-Hudson. Stein attended Hessian Hills school and was taught woodworking by sculptor Wharton and painting by painter/muralist/lithographer George Biddle In the latter half of the 1930s, she worked as an assistant at the Educational Alliance Art School where her uncle, Mr. Ostrowsky, was the director. While working there, Stein learned from sculptor Chaim Gross studying with Louise Nevelson. In the late 1930s Stein moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts where she studied with Josef Albers (husband of the weaver Anni Albers) and others who were associated with the Bauhaus movement. It was here that she met her husband, the architect Richard G. Stein, while he was doing his master's at Harvard. He served in World War II, after which the couple settled in Croton-on-Hudson. ==Career== Stein started out as a sculptor. In the 1960s she exhibited as a member of the Vectors artist group in New York City. After meeting Milton Sonday, the curator of textiles at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, she became increasingly interested in textiles and studied the museum's collection of textiles. Stein studied historical textile techniques using a microscope to see how the textile was formed and sketching the treads. She used these techniques, along with her knowledge of loom technology, to experiment to create new and different works. Her woven works included geometric abstract works and figurative images, using bright colours, muted colours and monochromatic black/grey/white. In Ikat, Stein created a technique that combined satin binding pattern with double ikat, such that the resist dyed warp and weft threads created a variation of colour intensity, and the weft- based pattern created a higher contrast than traditional ikat weavings. As a weaver, Stein's professional circle included textile artists such as Lenore Tawney and Mary Walker Phillips. Even into her 90s, Stein wove everyday in her studio. ===Puppets=== Ethel Stein created puppets out of old socks, initially for her son's nursery school, before starting a business of it. She sold the puppets through a Manhattan department store. In 1953, one puppet went to television puppeteer, Shari Lewis, and became known as Lamb Chop. Stein created several puppets for Shari Lewis. ==Death and legacy== Ethel Stein died of complications from pneumonia on Friday, March 9, 2018 in Cortlandt, New York at the age of 100. Jack Lenor Larsen, a textile designer and author said of Stein, \\"Ethel Stein did not shun an audience; rather, she sidestepped the pervasive marketing focus of others.\\" Daniel Walker, of the Art Institute of Chicago, called her a \\"weaver's weaver\\". ==Work== ===Major exhibitions=== Ethel Stein exhibited in group shows at major institutions in the United States including Cooper Hewitt, the American Craft Museum in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as exhibiting in England, the Netherlands and Switzerland. In 2014, Ethel Stein had her first solo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago at the age of 96. ===Public collections=== Cooper-Hewitt ==References== ==External links== *https://vimeo.com/101333309?ref=fb-share – a video produced by the Art Institute of Chicago as part of her exhibition Category:Women textile artists Category:American weavers Category:Artists from N Category:1917 Category:2018 deaths Category:American centenarians Category:Women centenarians ","title":"Ethel Stein"},{"id":"56710299","text":"Shawn Dennis (born 27 October 1965) is a professional basketball head coach for Shiga Lakestars. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Shiga Lakestars  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2017-18  602436 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3rd in Western---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Shiga Lakestars  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2018-19  601842 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"5th in Western---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Shiga Lakestars  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2019-20  412120 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3rd in Western---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- - ==References== ==External links== *Official blog * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Australian expatriate sportspeople in Japan Category:Australian expatriate sportspeople in New Zealand Category:Australian men's basketball coaches Category:Australian women's basketball coaches Category:Shiga Lakestars coaches ","title":"Shawn Dennis"},{"id":"56710381","text":"The 1947 World Table Tennis Championships – Men's Doubles was the 14th edition of the men's doubles championship.

Muslim citizens, mosques and other properties were attacked by mobs of Sinhalese Buddhists, and mobs of Muslims attacked Buddhists Temples and Sinhalese citizens. The Government of Sri Lanka undertook a forceful crackdown on the rioting by imposing a state of emergency and deploying the Sri Lankan Armed Forces to assist the Police in the affected areas. The situation was brought under control by 9 March. Two fatalities and ten injuries were reported among Sinhalese, Muslims and Police. According to the police, forty five incidents of damage to houses and businesses have been reported, while four places of worship have been attacked. The police arrested 81 persons in connection with rioting. Rioting in Kandy District began in Udispattuwa and Teldeniya, later spreading to Digana, Tennekumbura and other areas. It was sparked when a middle-aged truck driver of Sinhalese ethnicity was assaulted by four Muslim youth following a traffic accident. The truck driver died of his injuries four days later. On 5 March Sinhalese mobs began attacking Muslim properties in the region, resulting in widespread damage to property while some groups of local Sinhalese youth organized by Buddhist monks protected mosques from attackers; cricketers Mahela Jayawardena, Kumar Sangakkara, and Sanath Jayasuriya condemned the attacks and nearly 300 mostly Sinhalese volunteers rebuilt a Muslim business in Anamaduwa. The riots, the first large-scale Buddhist-Muslim sectarian violence since similar riots in 2014, prompted the Government of Sri Lanka to declare a State of Emergency for a period of ten days, in addition to the police curfew already imposed on the district. The state of emergency is the first such since 2011. Social media networks including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were blocked in parts of the country in an effort to prevent mobs from organizing their attacks and spreading propaganda. However, the block on the social media networks were uplifted after 72 hours and the cabinet minister, Harsha de Silva further stated that the social media networks have been returned to normal conditions by 10 March 2018. After three days of raid in the main town of Kandy, at least 81 people were reported to have been arrested including the main suspect, Amith Jeevan Weerasinghe by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) of the Sri Lankan police in connection to the incident as the situation has been under controlled by the forces. However, a curfew has been reimposed in the Kandy town until 9 March 2018. The police officers state that the unusual situation which prevailed in the country for few days has been brought under control but tight securities have been imposed in few parts of the nation as the predicted threats have been focused on the Muslim prayers on 9 March 2018 which is a Friday. The riots were denounced by Buddhist monks and many Sinhalese and Buddhist monks rallied to protect and help Muslims and Mosques during the prayers across the country. According to the Government, Independent observers, Muslims and Sinhalese in the area the majority of the rioters came from other areas of Sri Lanka to carry out the riots. The government revealed that about nearly 465 houses, businesses and vehicles were destroyed and promised to compensate for the families who were severely affected due to the communal violence. A few weeks after the end of the anti-Muslim riots, new CCTV footage revealed that some police officials aided the rioters. Further politicians of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's SLPP were seen during the riots and claimed to be trying to calm the rioters while the Government accused them of helping rioters. They were arrested on charges of torching a mosque but were granted bail after it was found that the alleged mosque was not torched. It was confirmed that the deficiencies and ineffective attitudes of the police are to be investigated and questioned by the Sri Lankan government. == Background == Despite mostly coexisting peacefully, many Sinhalese are suspicious of Muslims, believing that their slightly higher birth rates threaten their demographic supremacy, while others view Muslim businessmen as exploiting poor Sinhalese. Some political analysts believe that Sinhalese extremists are trying to transfer remaining hostility against Tamils onto the mostly Tamil-speaking Muslim population. Another factor is increasing Arab influence over Sri Lankan Muslim culture in recent years including the building a number of mosques using money coming from Arab countries and the adoption of the niqab by Muslim women which diverges from traditional dress in the area. Sri Lanka has seen several communally charged incidents between the majority Sinhala community and the country's Muslim minority. Ampara District had experienced tensions since 2017, with Buddhist groups accusing Muslims of forced conversions and vandalising Buddhist archaeological sites. The recent communal violence in Kandy is the first since the Black July violence which occurred in 1983 between Tamils and Sinhalese Buddhists. This violence is also the first time such communal violence has occurred between Muslims and Buddhists in the district of Kandy since the 1915 Ceylonese riots which was incited by the British administration. === Ampara === Late at night on 26 February, a group of youths arrived at a restaurant on D.S. Senanayake Street in Ampara town. The meal served by the restaurant contained elements resembling tablets. The youth shared a video of the owner, a Muslim man, supposedly admitting that the food contained sterilization pills. The owner of the restaurant was physically attacked by a mob, who then spread the word about the incident. The police arrested the restaurant owner as a result of the video. The claim made by the video was later proven to be false; the owner had in fact nodded his head in fear of the angry mob, without actually knowing the Sinhala word (sterilization pills), and thus without understanding the question he had been asked. according to sources Sinhalese mobs are not arrested. === Kandy District === At 2 PM on 22 February 2018, a Sinhalese lorry driver from Ambala, Medamahanuwara was assaulted by four Muslim youths in Karaliyadda, Teldeniya. The victim was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Kandy General Hospital and died on the night of 2 March from his injuries. The victim's assistant (also traveling in the lorry) was assaulted, admitted to hospital, and later discharged after treatment. The motive behind the attack has not been clearly established. Some reports state it stemmed from a road accident where the trucker had damaged the wing mirror of an auto rickshaw the assailants had been travelling in while attempting to overtake it; all four suspects were reported to have been intoxicated. The suspects were arrested by the Sri Lanka Police on the day of the attack and remanded until 7 March. == Riots and violence == === Ampara === An aggressive mob had launched attacks on several shops in the surrounding area of Ampara. Hotels in the vicinity of the mosque were also attacked by the mobs, with the police unable to bring the situation under control. The Special Task Force and police reinforcements were then dispatched from nearby police stations which led to the mob dispersing. Areas with larger Muslim populations in Maruthamunai, Sammanthurai, Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Kalmunai in Ampara District were conducting Hartals, as response against the anti-Muslim riots. The protests resulted in 8 buses being damaged, while Tamil media reporters were protected by the police. 31 Muslims were arrested who were damaging public properties and released after warning. === Kandy District === The first signs of violence were reported from Udispattuwa on the night of 2 March as the body of the victim was being taken to Ambala. Groups set light to tires on the road as a sign of protest against the killing; the police, anticipating violence, deployed 1000 Special Task Force personnel in and around the area, encompassing Moragahamula, Udispattuwa, Teldeniya and Ambagahalanda. Despite these efforts, two Muslim-owned shops in Moragahamula were subjected to arson on the night of 4 March- 28 suspects were arrested for their involvement. General disorderly behaviour and assorted violence associated to the killing by the residents of Teldeniya and outlying areas were also reported. The unrest spread to Digana on the morning of 5 March, when a large mob converged on the town, setting fire to a mosque, shops and houses. In response, police used tear gas and water cannons in an attempt to disperse the crowd, which saw retaliation from the mob through various projectiles while the violence spread to more residences, shops and nearby vehicles. Traffic along the A26 was forced to a halt, and by 3 PM, the police requested the support of the Sri Lanka Army, which deployed 200 troops from the Sinha Regiment base in Digana in the evening. The police then followed up by declaring a state of curfew district- wide in Kandy until 6 AM on 6 March; the same curfew was reimposed on Teldeniya and Pallekele at 8 PM on 6 March, after the body of a 24-year-old Muslim male was discovered within the remains of a shop in Digana. By the evening of 6 March, a total of 4 mosques, 37 houses, 46 shops and 35 vehicles were damaged or destroyed as a result of the riots in both Digana and other locations in the Kandy District; 1 confirmed fatality was reported. On the night of 6 March, mobs were observed in Lewella and Balagolla, moving towards Tennekumbura and the general direction of Kandy- an arson attack on a mosque in Tennekumbura was reported. High ambulance activity was reported from Menikhinna, and 7 people were arrested there for disorderly behaviour and for causing unrest. The curfew put in place on the evening of 6 March was lifted briefly on the morning of the 7th, but soon reimposed. 7 March also saw Muslim residents of Mullegama barricading themselves inside a local mosque after a Sinhalese mob attacked their homes alleging theft of a donation box from a nearby Buddhist temple; the Muslims accused the police of inaction in the face of the mobs. One Sinhalese male was reported to have died and another injured in an explosion of unknown origin in the course of the Mullegama attacks. Some media reported his injuries sustained in an attack carried out by Muslim men. A reaction that a Buddhist monk at the Mullegama temple said was precipitated by a projectile attack against his temple by Muslims earlier in the day. Katugastota also saw anti-Muslim violence and arson, while a mob assembled in the Ambatanna town center after a rumor of a temple being attacked: the mob then proceeded to damage property and engage in rioting. === Other districts === Small incidents were reported in other districts against Muslims. Unknown group burnt a tire in front mosque in Medina Nagar, Vavuniya. However, police and army controlled the situation and gave security to the mosque. Some shops belongs to Muslims were damaged and assaulted on workers on those shops in Ambatenna, Matale. A grenade blast has also occurred in the ongoing communal violence in the nation as a hand grenade has been made to blast by a group of people leaving one dead. The following incident has been reported following few hours after the ban on social media networks. == Response == Sri Lankan police arrested at least 81 rioters including Amith Jeevan Weerasinghe, the leader of the Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalist Mahason Balakaya who is believed to be the leading figure among the rioters alongside Suredha Suraweera who was also arrested. Ampitiye Sumanarathana Thera was also seen alongside Amith during the riot and also demanded the release of those arrested by the police but the thera was not arrested. Sumanarathana thera is known for his active participation in violence against Tamils and Muslims. Further the main suspects were brought to Colombo for further enquiries. A panel of three retired judges are set to be appointed by the Sri Lankan President to probe into the anti-Muslim riots to inquire into the incidents which held in areas such as Digana, Teldeniya. The newly appointed law and order minister, Ranjith Madduma Bandara stated that the current Sri Lankan government is planning to fresh legislation to ensure a code of conduct for the operation of social media networks in Sri Lanka in accordance with the international practices to avoid unethical false claims, rumours which have been spread by many suspicious people through social media. The minister also said that the law enforcement authorities and agencies have arrested people for conducting alleged hate campaigns regarding the ethnic riots between Muslims and Buddhists which prevailed in Kandy for about a week. Poilce raided the Mahason Balakaya office at Naththaranpotha in Kundasale after interrogating Amith Weerasinghe which revealed bottles used to make petrol bombs as well as equipment and propaganda materials such as leaflets, posters, notices, letters, banners, a large number of documents and wristbands, which were used in propagating hate speech. Further the police found computer central processing units (CPUs), several bank accounts, bank slips and several vehicle permits. === Ampara === Obstetricians and gynaecologists denied that pills can cause permanent sterility and stressed the need of surgical procedures such as vasectomy on males and tubal ligation surgery on females to cause permanent sterility. Director General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe also released a statement denying the existence of a method to sterilize a person through pills. Sri Lankan lecturer Dr. Mohamed Najimudeen from Melaka Manipal Medical College in Malaysia has also offered a prize of Rs. 1,000,000 to anyone able to prove sterilization medicines are being added to clothes or food in the country by various individuals. Health minister Rajitha Senaratne also claimed that there are no such medicines ever discovered to sterilize a male. Dr. Razia Pendse, the World Health Organization representative in Sri Lanka issued a state claiming, \\"There is no medication or 'pills' currently known or available that can permanently make a human being sterile. The information on the use of an 'infertility pill' or 'sterilization pill' mixed with food is baseless with no scientific evidence\\". United Nations Population Fund Sri Lanka Representative Ritsu Nacken in her statement noted that the incidents show the lack of access to accurate reproductive health information in Sri Lanka. Sociologists and senior lecturers at University of Sri Jayewardenepura's Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Dr. Praneeth Abeysundara and B.A. Tennyson Perera, called for authorities and media to create awareness and dialogues among community leaders and clerics to counter such paranoia. On 8 March, the country's Government Analyst's Office confirmed the contents of particles alleged to be infertility/sterilization tablets were carbohydrate-based clumps of flour. === Kandy District === The Government urged calm on 5 March, while the Ministry of Education ordered the closure of schools in the Kandy District. It also imposed a State of Emergency (the first since 2011) over the country on 6 March for a period of 10 days, granting the state powers to arrest and detain suspects indefinitely, and deploy armed forces at its will. The CID was tasked with an investigation into the event and its background. The police came under heavy criticism for its failure to impose order and its alleged hesitation in preventing property damage at the start of the riots. Several government and opposition MPs criticized the police and its decision-making, while others called for calm and harsh punishments to perpetrators of racially motivated violence. A group of Sinhalese Buddhist citizens and Buddhist clergy held a protest outside the Digana police station on 6 March demanding the release of all suspects arrested for their involvement in the riots. The government and the opposition party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna alleged an organized, political effort to inflame sectarian tensions in Kandy. The Bodu Bala Sena, at the center of the 2014 riots, accused the public of unfairly linking it to incidents of communal violence in the country as BBS was earlier accused and criticised by the critics and other political leaders for aggravating the violence between Muslims and Buddhists, which was later revealed that Bodu Bala Sena was unnecessarily blamed for the incident. BBS Secretary General Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara visited the assault victim's home on 4 March, and claimed he had urged residents of the area to remain calm. In an effort to prevent mobs from organizing online through social media platforms, internet access to the Kandy District was restricted by order of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC). Access to Facebook was blocked, and the Ministry of Defence instructed the TRC to report on individuals spreading hate speech on social media platforms. The Centre for Policy Alternatives, a think-tank based in Colombo, released a statement claiming videos containing \\"false information\\" that sought to incite sectarian violence were going viral online. Following the violence in Kandy, several foreign tourists have cancelled their visits to the historic Kandy town. This was evident despite the attempts taken by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to provide further updates to the foreign tourists about the country's current situation. But the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority stated that Kandy is returning to the normal situation and foreign tourists could resume their visits to the country. The riots affected both Sinhalese and Muslim communities in the areas with businesses run by Sinhalese in properties rented from Muslims being also burned by the mobs. After the riots ended citizens of Balagalla joined to help the Muslims affected by the riots. Pathadumbara Thalpotha Dhammajothi Thera the Chief Incumbent of the Balagolla Viharaya organized efforts to provide dry rations to Muslim families displaced due to riots. Many Buddhist monks also visited Muslim churches during the Friday prayers in 9 March to express solidarity with Muslims. An organization with the name, Citizens Against Racism has staged a peaceful protests on 8 March 2018 to combat ethnic minority violence in the country. Hundreds of Buddhists monks from the National Bhikku Front also launched a peaceful protest in Colombo accusing the rioters of destroying national unity. In addition Sinhalese and Buddhist volunteers actively participated in reconstruction efforts and one Muslim owned eatery which was set ablaze by rioters was repaired by over 300 volunteers with around 200 being Sinhalese within 12 hours attracting media attention The schools in the administrative Kandy District were re-opened on 12 March 2018 (Monday) following the gradual improvement in Kandy after the communal violence. The schools had been closed for about one week since 5 March 2018 due to the imposition of the state of emergency. ;International response Australia, Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States issued travel advisories warning their citizens to remain vigilant, avoid large crowds and protests, and to follow instructions by local authorities. * Turkey: The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement that expressed concerns over the violence, saying \\"the Sri Lankan government will take the necessary steps to ensure that different religious and ethnic communities continue to live together in peace across the country.\\" The ministry also offered condolences to the families of victims killed in the riots. * United Nations: The UN condemned the attacks, calling for a quick resolution of the situation in a statement released on 7 March. \\"The United Nations urges authorities to take immediate action against perpetrators and to ensure that appropriate measures are swiftly taken to restore normalcy in affected areas\\". UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, \\"We are obviously concerned over reports of the ongoing communal violence and we welcome the government's commitment to addressing the tensions and achieve reconciliation. We urge all Sri Lankans to resolve their difference through dialogue.\\" * United States: The Administration urged the Government of Sri Lanka act quickly against perpetrators of sectarian violence, in a statement released on 6 March. \\"Rule of law, human rights, and equality are essential for peaceful coexistence. It is important that the Government of Sri Lanka act quickly against perpetrators of sectarian violence, protect religious minorities and their places of worship, and conclude the State of Emergency swiftly, while protecting human rights and basic freedoms for all\\". * European Union: In a statement made on 8 March, the EU urged the government to take urgent action against hate crimes. \\"The recent attacks on communities are very worrying. It is important that the Government and the security forces take urgent action against hate crimes and ensure that the perpetrators of such actions are swiftly brought to justice. It is vital that all political leaders, religious and other community leaders condemn violence and make every effort to promote understanding and harmony between communities. The EU trusts that any actions taken under the State of Emergency will be proportionate and respect constitutional rights and freedoms\\". * Canada: The Government of Canada called on the Sri Lankan Government to ensure the safety and security of all minorities. \\"Canada welcomes the Government of Sri Lanka’s condemnation of the violent acts. Canada calls on the government to ensure the safety and security of all minorities, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. As we said at the United Nations Human Rights Council last month, frustrations persist among those trying to heal the wounds of Sri Lanka’s civil war. Ensuring that diversity and pluralism are valued is critical to the work of reconciliation in Sri Lanka\\". * China: The Government of China stated on 8 March that it believes the Government of Sri Lankan and its people are capable of handling the current situation. \\"We have noted relevant reports. This belongs to Sri Lanka's internal affairs. China believes that the Sri Lankan government and its people are capable of handling the current situation, and upholding Sri Lanka's social stability and ethnic solidarity. We also hope that Sri Lanka will take concrete measures to protect the security of Chinese citizens in Sri Lanka\\". ;Celebrity response Sri Lankan cricketers including Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Sanath Jayasuriya strongly condemned the situation, and asked the populace to come together to make the country united again. Former Sri Lankan cricketer, Muttiah Muralitharan pointed that his family members are feeling safe in Kandy and also said that there is no need to worry about the country following the declaration of the state of emergency. Former Sri Lankan president, Mahinda Rajapaksa accused and blamed the government for not acting in a more responsive manner to control the ethnic riots. He further mentioned that some cabinet ministers tried to blame the police officials rather than being responsible to control and manage the unusual situation which has spread in the nation. Further, Mahinda Rajapaksa has also been reported to have met the heads of diplomatic missions of few Islamic countries in order to discuss about the communal violence which erupted in the nation a few weeks ago. In addition, he also went onto visit Kandy on 9 March 2018 to discuss about the current situation in the area following the violence. Indian test cricketer, Ravichandran Ashwin has also deeply expressed his condolences and disarray towards the people of Sri Lanka and pointed out that Sri Lankan people of any cast are generally good. He further mentioned in his Twitter account, Sri Lanka would become great again after sometime. Human rights activist, Meenakshi Ganguly from India has also warned the Sri Lankan government for not taking immediate actions to eradicate communal violences in the nation. == Economic Impact == The riots negatively impacted the Economy of Sri Lanka as well as the local economy of Kandy. In addition to the destruction of many shops employing both Sinhalese and Muslims many tourists cancelled visits to Sri Lanka which heavily depends on the tourism industry. The violence in Kandy affected the Nuwara Eliya season in April where there was a 40% drop in tourist arrivals both local and foreign compared to the last year. Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga planned to invite Ambassadors of the various countries that imposed travel advisories with a site visit for diplomats mainly from the European and Middle Eastern nations on 13–14 May with cultural events and tours to assure them about the country returning to normalcy. == Other events == * The opening match of the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, a Tri-Series cricket tournament between Sri Lanka and India was held under tight security coinciding with the tense situation in the nation following the declaration of the state of emergency. * Despite the violence between Muslims and Buddhists in the island, the funeral of Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thero was held on 8 March 2018 in Colombo. == References == == External links == * Category:2018 in Sri Lanka Category:2018 riots Category:Ethnic riots Category:February 2018 crimes in Asia Category:History of Ampara District Category:History of Kandy District Category:March 2018 crimes in Asia Category:Opposition to Islam in Sri Lanka Category:Persecution by Buddhists Category:Religious riots Category:Riots and civil disorder in Sri Lanka Category:2018 crimes in Sri Lanka ","title":"2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka"},{"id":"56710462","text":"Rumbi Katedza is a Zimbabwean Film Producer and Director who was born on 17 January 1974. == Early life and education == She did her Primary and Secondary Education in Harare, Zimbabwe.

During World War II, Vauck was the director of the agents Referat within the Funkabwehr, the German Armies radio counter-intelligence organisation. As an anti-nazi, Vauck's work on the discovery of the Rote Kapelle anti-fascist resistance group during World War II, burdened him deeply until the end of his life. ==Life== After World War I finished, Vauck undertook study of mathematics and physics at the Technical University of Dresden. In 1922, he passed the exam for a higher education office, and two years later, under supervision of Gerhard Kowalewski, Vauck was promoted to Dr. phil with a thesis titled A generalisation of Bolzano's continuous but non-differentiable function () which is within Mathematics Subject Classification 26 Real functions. Vauck's first career position was as a teacher at the secondary school in Thum and then from 1926 as a teacher at the secondary school in Bautzen. After the war from 1948, he became a teacher in Bautzen and later became a lecturer in physics and electrical engineering at the engineering school in Bautzen. ==Military career== During his military career, Vauck held the rank of Oberleutnant. In the spring of 1942, Vauck was ordered to report to In 7/VI to attend a cryptographic course (General der Nachrichtenaufklärung Training Referat).

On 15 July 1942, the discovery that lead to the full realisation of the size and complexity of Rote Kappelle was made, when a message was deciphered. On that date, Vauck successfully deciphered a message. It had the format: ::KL 3 DE RTX 1010-1725 WDS GBT FROM DIREKTOR TO KENT PERSONAL: that was decoded into; KENT from Director Personal.

Unknown to Vauck, there was also a informer working in Referat 12 in Vauck's team, Corporal Horst Heilmann, who was supplying Harro Schulze-Boysen (Coro) with intelligence. Heilmann tried to contact Schulze-Boysen but was unsuccessful and left a message with his wife to phone him back. Schulze-Boysen eventually did this, but Heilmann was absent. However Vauck answered the phone and when he requested the name of the caller to take a message, and was met with Schulze-Boysen, who was already identified as CORO, the deception was revealed, and Heilmann was arrested. ==References== Category:1896 births Category:1958 deaths Category:20th-century German mathematicians ","title":"Wilhelm Vauck"},{"id":"56710506","text":"Fadzayi Mahere (born 30 July 1985) is a prominent Zimbabwean lawyer and politician.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==History== The Fairweather family settled in Imlay City in the early 1860s, and by 1864 was farming on land south of town. At about that time one family member, James F. Fairweather, started a drygoods business in town. Although settled much earlier, Imlay City was not actually platted until 1870, when the Port Huron and Lake Michigan Railroad constructed a line through the settlement. The arrival of the railroad created a business boom, and in 1871 James Fairweather purchased a lot in town, and by 1874 had this house constructed. In 1879 James F. Fairweather ended his business, sold his home, and apparently moved from Imlay City. The new owner of the house was Jacob C. Lamb, who was born in Burlington County, New Jersey in 1828 and had settled in Dryden, Michigan in 1854. He began farming, and also ran a mercantile business dealing in wool with his brother. By 1867 he was dealing over 250,000 pounds of wool, and in 1871 constructed a grain elevator in Imlay City, and in 1876 an evaporator used to dry fruit. Lamb maintained his house in Dryden until 1878, when he moved into this house in Imlay City. He continued his various business enterprises, and by 1880 ran one of the county's largest businesses, with a yearly income of over $250,000.

The book is an account of the American volunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939. The story centers around several American volunteer fighters and journalists, tracing their motivations for joining the war and their experiences during the war which left many disillusioned. The book explains the involvement of foreign leaders including Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Joseph Stalin, and explains why the Republican faction ultimately lost. Hochschild knew several American volunteers personally, and was partly inspired by them to write the book. Most of Hochschild's archival research on the subject was carried out at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives. Spain in Our Hearts was generally well received by critics. Hochschild's writing in particular, was praised for being compelling and well-researched. Many reviewers also commended the book's balanced perspective that covers the atrocities committed by both factions in the war. In his lukewarm review, William Deresiewicz felt that the book did not provide adequate context for the war, leaving many of the questions the book raises unanswered. ==Background and development== George Orwell's (pictured) Homage to Catalonia spurred Hochschild's interest in the Spanish Civil War Adam Hochschild is an American author and co-founder of the progressive American magazine Mother Jones. Much of his writing focuses on historical social injustices and the individuals who campaigned to end them. Hochschild said of the overarching theme in his work: \\"To me there's nothing more interesting than trying to evoke moments when men and women risked their lives to battle horrendous injustice [...] It's hard for me to imagine spending four or five years working on a book if there isn't some pressing moral issue at the core of the story.\\" A popular historian, Hochschild has stated that his intention is not to provide new analyses of historical events with his books, but rather \\"to bring a period of time alive by focusing on 10 or 12 people who lived through it, and whose lives intersected in some way.\\" Hochschild's previous books include the acclaimed King Leopold's Ghost, an account of the colonial atrocities committed in the Belgian Congo; The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin, an account of the effects of Joseph Stalin's dictatorship on contemporary Russians; and Bury the Chains, an account of the anti-slavery movement in the British Empire. Hochschild was first drawn to write about the Spanish Civil War due to his personal associations with several Americans who had volunteered in the war. Hochschild's interest in the topic was deepened by his high regard for Homage to Catalonia, George Orwell's personal account of his experiences in the war, as well as Hochschild's observation that the war was the only time that many Americans had risked their lives in another nation's civil war. Hochschild began his research for Spain in Our Hearts by spending months reading books and articles about the participation of American volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, so as to determine the main characters in his book. After narrowing down the focus of his book, Hochschild conducted extensive archival research, particularly at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives, whose collection includes the writings of hundreds of the American volunteers. While visiting the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, Hochschild was introduced to the writings of Lois Orr who then became a major character in his book. ===Title=== The title for the book is taken from a quote by French philosopher Albert Camus on the Spanish Civil War: \\"Men of my generation have had Spain in our hearts. It was there that they learned ... that one can be right and yet be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit and that there are times when courage is not rewarded.\\" ==Content== General Francisco Franco was the leader of the Nationalist faction Spain in Our Hearts is an account of the American volunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War. The civil war was fought between the left-leaning Republicans who were loyal to the democratically elected Second Spanish Republic, and the right-wing Nationalists who were led by General Francisco Franco. While the Nationalists were backed by foreign fascist leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the Republicans were not supported by other Western democratic governments due to their communist-leaning ideologies. Despite this, many left-wing Americans volunteered to fight on the side of the Republicans, forming the Lincoln Battalion of the International Brigades. The book is told as a collective biography of several American volunteers and journalists, namely, Robert Hale Merriman, an Economics doctoral student who commandeered the Lincoln Battalion; Lois Orr, a member of the POUM female militia; and journalists Ernest Hemingway, Louis Fischer and Virginia Cowles. George Orwell, a British novelist and volunteer fighter in the POUM militia, and Jason Gurney, a British sculptor who fought in the International Brigades, are also major characters. Merriman serves as the central figure and the book begins with his disappearance during battle in April 1938. Hochschild explains the motivations of the American volunteers, who fought on the side of the Republicans due to their opposition to fascism and their support of communism. Severely lacking in equipment and training, the Lincoln Battalion suffered heavy losses such as in the Battle of Brunete in 1937. While the Republicans received limited aid from Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, the arms embargo that the United States, United Kingdom and France had imposed on Spain meant that they could not buy the weapons needed to fight against the Nationalists, who were being armed by Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. As such, Hochschild explains that many of the Republicans' attacks and strategies were not made for the purpose of direct victory, but instead were meant to convince Western powers to commit to supporting them. Hochschild discusses the impact Texaco chairman, Torkild Rieber, had on the civil war. Rieber was sympathetic to fascist regimes and illegally supplied cheap oil on credit to the Nationalists in direct violation of the American arms embargo. Hochschild explains how Stalinist repressed the non-communist leftists and anti-Stalinist POUM members, which in turn disillusioned many of the American volunteers. George Orwell was inspired by the experience to write Homage to Catalonia, and anti-Stalinism was a key theme in his later works such as Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Hochschild points out that Hitler and Mussolini used the Spanish Civil War to test out weapons and strategies that they would later employ in World War II. This includes the 1937 bombing of Guernica which was the first ever aerial bombing of civilians by a military air force. Hochschild concludes that Western intervention would have prevented the Nationalist victory in the civil war, but ultimately would not have prevented World War II. The book's final chapter details Merriman's death, with quotes from his widow's letters, and ends with an American woman travelling in 2012 to an old battleground site to honor her uncle's death in 1938. ==Critical response== Adam Hochschild in 2017 Spain in Our Hearts received many positive reviews for its \\"exceptional\\" and \\"moving\\" narrative, particularly its prose that historian Michael Kazin described in The New York Times as \\"consistently vivid yet emotionally restrained.\\" In a lukewarm review, Harper's Magazines William Deresiewicz was critical of the book for not providing sufficient background and context to the war, citing its \\"rush narrative\\" that left many questions unanswered. Rich Benjamin, writing for The Guardian, felt that while the book sheds little new information about the war, overall, Hochschild provides new insight into the conflict through his gifted storytelling, deep knowledge of military history and \\"beautiful sense of private hurt.\\" Other reviewers enjoyed the pace of the book and felt that it was well-researched. Many reviewers also praised the book for providing a \\"nuanced\\" and \\"unromantic\\" perspective of the war that does not gloss over the atrocities both sides committed despite Hochschild's clear sympathy for the Republic's cause. *Bakshian Jr., Aram (June 1, 2016). \\"Book Review: 'Spain in our Hearts: American in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939\\".

The book's focus on the perspective of the American volunteers in an \\"often overlooked\\" conflict was described by Kazin as unique and by journalist Bob Drogin as \\"long-overdue\\". Hochschild's revelations on the little-known involvement of Texaco chairman Torkild Rieber in bankrolling the Nationalists was also commended. Author Kevin Baker wanted Hochschild to cover a wider perspective, but conceded that doing so would have meant losing the \\"shining courage and tenacity\\" that Hochschild evokes from his characters' personal stories. On the other hand, the World Socialist Web Site's reviewer considered Hochschild to have a poor grasp on the wider political issues surrounding the Spanish Civil War, asserting that the book perpetuates pro-Stalinist propaganda and understates the Republic's repression of POUM members. The main characters, many of whom are little known, were considered compelling by reviewers. Hochschild's use of writings from the warranging from reports by writers such as Ernest Hemingway and André Malraux, to letters between Martha Gellhorn and Eleanor Rooseveltwas seen as a strength that enhanced the book.

It had interests in many sectors including mechanical and electrical engineering. It was founded in Turin on 17 July 1880, with a share capital of one million lire, with the aim of undertaking the \\"construction and repair of railway material, metal bridges, canopies, mechanical, electrical and aeronautical constructions as well as woodworking. generally\\". ==History== The origins of Savigliano are intertwined with those of one of the first Piedmontese railway companies, the Società della Ferrovia Torino-Cuneo, which had built a workshop for the maintenance and repair of its rolling stock next to Savigliano station. In 1869, with the transfer of ownership of the line to the Società per le Ferrovie dell'Alta Italia (SFAI), the workshop was closed. On 14 December 1879, the municipality of Savigliano signed a memorandum of understanding with the SFAI, pledging to pay a considerable sum of money, and rented the abandoned workshop of the Turin- Cuneo railway to a Belgian company building railway material, enabling it to resume activity. ==Production== On 17 July 1880 the Società Nazionale Officine di Savigliano was founded in Turin, with headquarters in Savigliano, which rapidly expanded to take on 640 employees and make a monthly production of over fifty rolling stock units commissioned by various railway companies such as SFAI, Ferrovie Romane and Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. The elegant sleeping cars produced for the latter were presented at the Turin Exhibition in 1884. In 1889, SNOS merged with the Società Anonima Italiana Ausiliare, a Turin-based company competing with the related facilities located in Corso Mortara near Torino Dora station. This led to a further expansion of production that, on the threshold of the First World War, also embraced electrical and mechanical machinery as well as metal constructions such as bridges and viaducts in many foreign countries. The period between 1915 and 1918 saw Savigliano strongly engaged in war production with activities in the nascent aeronautical sector, war equipment, cannons and ammunition. The post- war period saw the SNOS engaged in extensive production of large metal structures such as the roof of the new Milan Central station, electromechanical cranes for the major Italian ports and electric locomotives for both three-phase alternating current and direct current. The Ethiopian campaign had seen it strongly involved both in war production and in the construction of infrastructure of all kinds but, in the Second World War there was greater involvement in sectors such as radio and telephone field transmissions. Like other large industries, Savigliano's plants had suffered war damage but, by 1948, it had resumed supplies to the State Railways that were commissioning the production of rolling stock of all kinds. ==Takeover by Fiat== Soon afterwards, Fiat took a shareholding in the company and this gradually increased until FIAT had total corporate control. In 1970, the plants in Turin and Savigliano were separated, the latter becoming Fiat Ferroviaria Savigliano. Savigliano was then taken over by a group of large electromechanical companies, including General Electric, Ercole Marelli and Ansaldo. In the 1980s, Savigliano became a leader in the electromechanical sector in Italy and the Mediterranean. After other changes of ownership at the end of the twentieth century it becomes Savigliano SpA and this was followed by divestments and downsizing. ==High-speed trains== Among the most prestigious constructions of the Savigliano railway plant were the prototypes E.444.001-004, the first high-speed electric locomotives of the Ferrovie dello Stato, delivered between 1967 and 1968 with the Savigliano brand, and the electric train ETR.401, progenitor of the Pendolino tilting train family, delivered in 1976 with the FIAT Ferroviaria Savigliano brand following the spin-off from SNOS. ==Other notable projects== * 1887-1889: Paderno bridge * 1883: Bridge over the Villoresi canal - road * 1887: Casalmaggiore railway bridge (Brescia - Parma line) * 1892: Bridge on the Po of Cremona - road and rail * 1916: Ponte della Gerola (Casei Gerola - Sannazzaro de 'Burgondi road) * 1916: Ponte di Zimella * 1917: Biplane C.36 * 1925-1928: Ronciglione bridge * 1926: FS Class E.626 locomotive prototypes * 1927-1939: E.626 locomotives * 1950: Ponte della Becca ==Sale to Alstom== On 1 August 2000, the prestigious plant was sold to Alstom and this marked the final exit of FIAT from the railway sector. ==References== ==Further reading== * (EN) Grey, C.

It became a suburb out of one of the Tygerberg’s original farms. ==History== On 17 October 1714, the Governor of the Cape Colony award the farm Blommesteijn to Theuns Dirksz van Schalkwyk. Van Schalkwyk was a Dutch immigrant. In September 1732, the farm was granted to van Schalkwyk’s daughter Anna Dirksz Brommert (Nee van Schalkwyk). At the same time Anna also received Door de Kraal farm, which previously belonged to Tryntje Theuinisse. These two farms became one and was known as Door de Kraal. Johan Albrecht Dell was the new owner in 1814. Cornelis Valkenburg de Villiers bought the farm in 1866, and his son JH de Villiers inherited it in 1899. He divided the farm in four parts; one part remained Door de Kraal, one part he sold to Hume Pipe Company (This company mined clay in Bellville's Quarry), one part he gave his son JJH de Villiers (it was called de Bron) and the fourth part to PHT de Villiers (it was called Witboom). PHT de Villiers sold Witboom for residential development in 1948. It then became Kenridge.

She is particularly known for her work on Dippers and the preservation of river habitats. ==Career== Tyler gained her PhD in Zoology at University of Cambridge, where she also met and married Lyndsay Tyler, a veterinarian. Tyler's doctoral thesis was on the free-range ponies in the New Forest. Following her marriage, Tyler moved with her family to Wiltshire where she conducted a study of the area's Grey Wagtails and became the most prolific female British bird ringer. The Tyler family moved first to the United Arab Emirates and then to Ethiopia in 1973. In Ethiopia Tyler continued her work on bird ringing and made monthly contributions to the newsletter of the Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society. Tyler also provided articles and illustrations for the conservation journal Agazen, which was used in around 2,000 schools in Ethiopia. The Tylers also led natural history tours of the area. Tyler also returned to her work on Wagtails funded by the British Ornithological Union and investigated ecological factors that affected the distribution of both local and migratory birds in Ethiopia. From May 1976, Tyler, together with her husband and two children, were held captive for 8 months by rebels in Tigray. Despite considerable hardship, Tyler continued to make observations of local bird-life and has credited her ornithological skills with helping her family to cope with captivity. Her observations were published in the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club. On her return to the UK, Tyler and her family moved to Monmouthshire where Tyler worked for Gwent Wildlife Trust and then the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds as the Conservation Officer for Wales. From the 1980s, Tyler was a committee member of Gwent Ornithological Society, regional representative for the British Trust for Ornithology, and joint plant recorder for Monmouthshire for the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre. In the 1990s, Tyler spent five years in Botswana where she worked on nest card-filling for the new BirdLife Botswana.

It was first enabled on October 11, 2017 by introducing a new native 3D media type in Facebook News Feed. Initially the users could only post 3D objects from Oculus Medium and marker drawings from Spaces directly to Facebook as fully interactive 3D objects. The feature was available for desktops and mobile phones that support the underlying WebGL API. On February 20, 2018 Facebook added support for the industry-standard glTF 2.0 file format for Facebook 3D posts. This allowed artists and creators to share 3D content on Facebook from a variety of sources. To make 3D Posts glTF 2.0 compliant, the support for textures, lighting, and physically based rendering techniques was implemented. 3D posts also supported unlit workflows for photogrammetry and stylized art. Facebook has since disallowed users from sharing 3D objects. ==Creating 3D Posts== There were four ways to get a 3D asset to appear in a Facebook Post: * Drag and drop an asset into Facebook's Post composer and publish it. * Share a link to a web page that has Facebook Open Graph Sharing metadata tags. * Share a local asset on an Android device using Android's native Sharing action. * Create a 3D Post programmatically with the 3D Posts API. ==Tools for authoring content== GLB files (binary form of glTF) were required to be loaded in Facebook 3D posts. These files could be obtained by converting from other files formats such as FBX or non-binary glTF.

In 1913, the gardens' bandstand of 1891 was enclosed within a building of glass to form the Kursaal, allowing audiences to enjoy band performances in all weathers. During World War I, the Kursaal served as a reception centre for injured soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who were accommodated in local camps following the Gallipoli Campaign. The Kursaal was later demolished and replaced by the Weymouth Corporation with the Alexandra Gardens Concert Hall, which was opened on 7 June 1924 by the Mayor of Weymouth. The gardens' bandstand was relocated to Nothe Gardens. The hall was requisitioned for military use during World War II and reopened again in 1945.

Lamas convey rainwater from the Murge plateau to the endpoint of the drainage basin they belong to. Lamas are generally confused with rivers or streams. There is a big difference between lamas and streams, since lamas collect only rainwater of their drainage basin, while they are completely dry when there is no rain. Moreover, in lamas water mostly flows underground and just a small amount of the rainwater flows on its surface. As for lamas, surface runoff is greatest in the extreme and uncommon situations of heavy rain. Lamas usually contain fertile soil, that deposited over the millennia due to the erosion and they are usually cultivated. Since they contain fertile soil, they are distinguishable from the nearby typical area of the Murge plateau, that is almost everywhere stony, arid and hard to grow. Lamas also occur in proximity of such notable dolines as Pulo di Altamura, Gurio Lamanna and Tre Paduli. Those lamas prove that the above dolines originated due to karst processes, that is the double action, both mechanical and chemical, of the rainwater conveyed by the lamas. == Characteristics == Lamas are made up of alluvial soil deposited over the millennia and they are very fertile, in juxtaposition with the fractured limestone rocks typical of the Murge plateau. For this reason and for the rainwater frequently flowing through the beds of the lamas, they have been inhabited and cultivated since the Neolithic Age. The existence of lamas is due to the karst processes of Apulia region and Murge. The fractured limestone rocks turn out to be highly permeable to rainwater (limestone itself is not particularly permeable, but if heavily fractured, it becomes extremely permeable). The high permeability of the whole region is responsible for the low surface runoff and the higher amount of water flowing underground. Inside lamas, rainwater also flows on its surface, but in a smaller amount. Rainwater flowing underground follows almost the same path as the lama's. This is due to the capillary fringe (Water table). == See also == * Karst * Murge * Alta Murgia National Park * Pulo di Altamura * Pulicchio di Gravina * Gurio Lamanna == References == == Bibliography == * == External links == * http://www.michelemonno.it/masserie/morfologia.html Category:Geologic formations of Italy Category:Geography of Apulia ","title":"Lama (geology)"},{"id":"56711294","text":"Sir William Cook, 2nd Baronet (c. 1630 - January 1708, of Broome Hall, Norfolk was a member of the East Anglian gentry and Tory Member of Parliament.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/cook- sir-william-1630-1708 ==Life== He was the eldest son of William Cook (died 1681), whose father had acquired Broome Hall by marriage in 1603.

He became a commissioner for assessment Norfolk in 1661 and for Suffolk in 1679, holding both posts until 1680. His marriage settlement dates to 1664 - he married Jane Steward (died 1698), daughter of William Steward of Barton Mills. They had seven daughters. In 1675 he was made commissioner for recusants in Norfolk. He had become deputy lieutenant of Norfolk by 1676 and in 1681 he succeeded to his father's baronetcy. The 1677 session of parliament began to show fracture lines between Charles II's court and Parliament. Cook supported Robert Paston in backing the former, making him a potential pro-Crown candidate in the 1679 and 1681 elections.E. Bohun, Autobiography 24-25. Cook did finally stand for Great Yarmouth in 1685 and won one of its two seats - in the same year he was made a freeman of Great Yarmouth. However, soon afterwards he wrote to William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury: He was appointed to nine minor committees during James II's single Parliament - he was the first man appointed to the committee for the bill for the renewal of the Yarmouth Harbour Act, meaning it was probably he who had introduced it.Bodl. Tanner mss 31, f. 17. In 1688 he agreed that some of the laws penalising Roman Catholics and non-conformists might \\"require a review and amendment\\" but refused to agree to the abolition of the Test Acts. He was thus removed from his deputy lieutenancy and all other local office in February 1688 and in October that year refused to sit on the bench alongside Roman Catholics. In the post-Glorious Revolution elections of 1689 he was returned for Norfolk and also sat for the county in 1690 and 1698. When the House of Commons had to vote on the House of Lords' motion that the throne was not vacant (due to its being occupied by William III and Mary II), Cook voted in agreement. After brief sick leave early in 1690, he returned to Westminster and sat on twenty committees in the Convention Parliament, including ones to repeal the Corporation Act 1661, to inquire into the fall in rents, to adopt new oaths of supremacy and allegiance and to consider abolishing the hearth tax.

She has served as leader of The Left party parliamentary group in the Landtag since 2009, including as sole leader since 2014. She has also been deputy leader of the federal party since 2014. ==Education and personal life== Wissler attended the Dreieich Wingert School from 1987 to 1991 and the Dreieich Ricarda High School from 1991 to 2001. She then completed a degree in political science from 2001 to 2012 at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt. In addition to her studies, she worked as a part-time specialist saleswoman in a hardware store from 2002 to 2007. From 2005 to 2008 she also worked in the constituency office of Bundestag deputy Werner Dreibus. ==Political career== Wissler co- founded the Hessian branch of Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative (WASG) in 2004, and joined The Left when WASG merged into it in 2007. At its founding congress, Wissler was elected as one of the 44 members of the party executive committee. In the 2008 Hessian state election, she was one of six Left party deputies elected. She retained her seat in the 2009, 2013, and 2018 elections. She was deputy leader of the parliamentary group from 2008 to 2009, then became co-leader of the group alongside Willi van Ooyen in February 2009. In 2011, Wissler became leader of the Left party's local branch in the Hessian capital of Frankfurt am Main. She ran for mayor of Frankfurt am Main in the 2012 and 2018 elections. In 2012, she placed fifth with 3.8% of the vote; in 2018, she placed fourth with 8.8%. After Willi van Ooyen's resignation in 2014, Wissler became the sole parliamentary leader of her party in the Hessian Landtag.https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/im-portraet-janine-wissler- klassenkaempferin-im-parlament-12934641.html Wissler is a member of attac and the trade union ver.di. Until 2020, she was a member of the Trotskyist group Marx21. She was a prominent member of the Socialist Left, a socialist faction within The Left, until 2020. In the 2018 Hessian state election, Wissler was one of the party's lead candidates alongside Jan Schalauske. The party won 6.3%, its best result to date, and increased its parliamentary presence from six to nine members. At the 2014 Left party congress, Wissler was elected one of six federal deputy leaders. She received the highest proportion of votes of any candidate. In January 2020, Wissler was among several politicians who received death threats from \\"NSU 2.0\\", a purported successor of neo-Nazi terrorist group the National Socialist Underground (NSU). The threats included confidential information taken from Frankfurt police computers. She was subject to further threats in July 2020. An investigation into a potential far-right extremist network operating within the Hessian police was subsequently launched by the state government. In September 2020, The Left's federal co-leaders Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger announced they would not seek re-election at the October party congress. Wissler subsequently announced her candidacy for the federal co-leadership. Prior to submitting her application, she resigned from Marx21 and the Socialist Left, stating it was customary for candidates to terminate their association with internal factions. ==Political positions== Wissler is considered a member of her party's left wing. She rejects capitalism as an \\"inhuman, cruel system\\". She has stated that a classless society cannot be achieved through parliaments or governments, and that historical progress has always been achieved through revolution. Wissler advocates the Germany's withdrawal from NATO and the alliance's dissolution. She opposes all military missions abroad, even under a United Nations mandate, stating: \\"There are no 'humanitarian interventions'. Wars are never fought out of charity, but out of economic and political interests.\\" She supports raising taxes on the rich to provide greater funding for public services. When asked what she believed the world would look like in fifty years, she stated \\"I wish for a world in which the pursuit of profit does not come first and in which all people can live in peace and social security. If the enormous wealth that exists in the world were distributed fairly, no one would have to live in poverty. But to do that, you have to fundamentally change the balance of power and ownership.\\" In 2020, she stated that her party must stand up for justice, ecology, and peace at home and abroad, acting as a force that \\"supports concrete struggles and represents an anti-capitalist perspective\\". ==Assessment== Wissler was aged 26 upon her election to the Landtag, and quickly attracted a high profile for her rapid advancement at a young age, as well as her controversial positions. She was portrayed as a contrast to then-Minister-President of Hesse Roland Koch, a noted conservative from the right-wing of the CDU. At this time, Oskar Lafontaine recognised her as a great political talent. Wissler is considered a pragmatic and effective parliamentarian. She was a key figure in the unsuccessful attempt to form a red-red-green government in Hesse after the 2008 election. As co-leader of her party's parliamentary group in Hesse, she was described as reliable and conciliatory, able to work constructively across party lines; FAZ reported that deputies from other parties preferred to work with her than her counterpart van Ooyen. The publication described Wissler's speeches as among the most pointed of any deputy, and that \\"she uses all the instruments that parliament has to offer with great virtuosity\\". Within her party, she is well-connected in both the western and eastern states. ==Controversy== Wissler's high profile and radical positions have attracted criticism. The Hessian CDU described her statements about parliamentarism and revolution as \\"particularly worrying\\" and evidence of the \\"partially anti- constitutional\\" nature of her party, claiming they represent its \\"turning away from parliamentary democracy\\". Her election as co-Landtag leader was received with some controversy within her own party due to her association with Marx21 (formerly Linksruck), which is recognised by the Bundesverfassungsschutz as an extremist group. Wissler was accused of \\"falsifying history\\" by members of the Social Democratic Party after claiming that Social Democrats were responsible for the murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. At demonstrations against the opening of the Seat of the European Central Bank on 18 March 2015, she worked as a parliamentary observer and accompanied the Italian \\"rainbow\\" group. According to the police, this group was responsible for riots in the city centre. Wissler subsequently condemned such behaviour, stating: \\"That is definitely not what it should be about. We wanted a peaceful protest against the ECB.\\" ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:German women in politics Category:Members of the Landtag of Hesse Category:Politicians from Hesse Category:The Left (Germany) politicians Category:21st-century German politicians Category:21st-century German women politicians ","title":"Janine Wissler"},{"id":"56711693","text":"The men's 5000 metres at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on 20 February 2017 in Obihiro, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Monday, 20 February 2017  14:35  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } == Records == ==Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=40Pair !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -   4  align=left 6:24.32 -   5  align=left  6:29.67  -   4  align=left  6:31.84  -  4  3  align=left  6:40.26 -  5  5  align=left  6:41.17  -  6  6  align=left  6:41.76  -  7  2  align=left  6:48.37  -  8  2  align=left  6:48.38 -  9  6  align=left  6:50.60  -  10  3  align=left  6:55.90  -  11  1  align=left  7:44.31  } ==References== ==External links== *Results Men 5000 ","title":"Speed skating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games – Men's 5000 metres"},{"id":"56711699","text":"The 1979–80 season was the 34th season in FK Partizan's existence.

Entered service 1936. Bohn advertisement showing a streamlined ocean liner (never built). Metal Progress, 1946.Metal Progress, Vol. 49 (1946), p. 483. The Streamlined Ocean Liner was a design by Norman Bel Geddes for a streamlined steam-powered ocean liner. The shape was compared by Pathé to that of a porpoise, blunt at the front and tapered at the rear. It first appeared in Geddes' 1932 book Horizons and an outline patent was filed in 1933 with a detailed patent following in 1934. An offer was made for the rights to the design in the late 1930s, which Geddes refused, as he still hoped to sell it to an American shipbuilder, but the ship was never built. ==Background== Norman Bel Geddes was one of the first industrial designers in the United States. He was one of the pioneers of streamlining in design, producing ambitious and futuristic projects in the 1930s for vehicles, flying cars, aircraft, and consumer goods, only some of which were realized.Back to the Future: A New Look at Modernist Hero Norman Bel Geddes, Designer of the Original 1939 \\"Futurama\\". Paul Goldberger, Vanity Fair, 22 October 2013. Retrieved 26 March 2018. ==Design== The liner was designed by Norman Bel Geddes and his staff as an \\"office exercise\\", an ambitious or unusual project of the type that Geddes was in the habit of giving to his staff in the gaps between client commissions.Szerlip, p. 215. It would have been long with a displacement of 70,000 tons and accommodated 2,000 first-class passengers and 900 crew. Its streamlined form was intended to reduce the effect of wind resistance and improve speed by an estimated 14 percent. The streamlining was created by the cigar shape of the ship, which hid the oval smoke stacks inside the superstructure along with all the other external features of the ship such as lifeboats, walkways, and sundecks. Behind the rear smoke stack were two small aircraft that would normally be hidden. In good weather, parts of the outer skin, which was part transparent, could be slid back to expose recreation areas or, in the event of an emergency, launch the 24 lifeboats. The only protruding part of the design was the navigator's bridge which was swept back like a monoplane wing in order to reduce wind resistance. The design first appeared in Geddes' 1932 book Horizons,Geddes, Norman Bel. (1932) Horizons.

Also featured in Horizons was a 1932 design for a giant aircraft known as Airliner Number 4 that Geddes saw as a replacement for the ocean liner and which he hoped would cut the travel time from America to England to 42 hours from the four and a half days taken by an ocean liner.Szerlip, pp. 130–132. ==Reception and legacy== In April 1934, the liner was shown on the front cover of Popular Science Monthly with a full page feature inside, in which it was described as one of the \\"Ocean Greyhounds\\".\\"New Streamlining for Big Ships\\", Popular Science Monthly, April 1934, p. 37. Popular Mechanics used the same phrase in 1935, additionally suggesting that the idea of the streamlined ship had been modeled on the air clipper, describing it as \\"like a great airliner with its flying bridge\\".\\"Streamline Ships Modeled After Air Clippers\\", Popular Mechanics, November 1935, p. 702. In 1935, the liner featured in a Pathé newsreel titled \\"The Liner Of Tomorrow!\\" in which the narrator explained streamlining and compared the shape of the ship to that of a porpoise, blunt at the front and tapered at the back, saying: \\"nature evolved this form a long time ago\\".\\"The Liner Of Tomorrow!\\", British Pathé, 1935. Retrieved 2 March 2018. Encyclopædia Britannica pictured the liner in a supplement titled \\"Machine-Made Art\\" (1935), while The New York Sun described it as \\"a vessel so far removed, yet not without its own beauty of line that our work-a-day brain reels before it\\". Despite Geddes' patents, vessels began to appear with a similarity to his such as Raymond Loewy's for the Virginia Ferry Company (1933) and the redesigned (launched 1935) with its aircraft styling. In the late 1930s, theatrical designer Ernest de Weerth visited Geddes on behalf of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and offered to buy all the blueprints, sketches, and rights to the ship for $200,000. Geddes declined, as he still expected to sell the idea to American shipbuilders. In 2015, cultural commentator Bernhard Siegert commented, \\"One can see that it is a manmade machine, yet it nonetheless has taken on the appearance of a thing shaped by wind and water, like a smoothly polished bone. Is it suppose to move on, above, or under water?\\" Papers relating to the project are held in the Norman Bel Geddes Collection at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.Job 248, Streamlined Ocean Liner, 1932–1959.

He attended Caius College, Cambridge from 1672, the year in which he also succeeded his father in the baronetcy. His guardian was Sir Horatio Townshend, but his tutor at Cambridge was Dr Robert Brady. He headed his tenants at the county election in February 1679 but was still too young to replace Sir Christopher Calthorpe as MP for Norfolk in 1679. On 20 April 1680 he married Elizabeth Dashwood, daughter of a merchant from Hackney named George Dashwood - they had four sons and five daughters. One of the younger sons, Thomas, was a Tory MP for Truro from 1713 to 1715. Also in 1680 he became a justice of the peace, followed by deputy lieutenant of Norfolk in 1683. Robert Paston nominated him as a pro-Charles II candidate for Norfolk in 1681, but he lost the election, only to win in 1685. In 1682 he became a freeman of King's Lynn and was one of the Norfolk signatories to the loyal address critiquing the Association. On questioning by the Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk he refused to support repealing the Penal Laws and Test Acts against Roman Catholics. This led to his removal from his deputy lieutenancy and his post as JP in February 1688 and in October that year he was offered a return to the bench but refused, since he would have to sit on the bench with Roman Catholics. After the Glorious Revolution he seems to have become a non- juror.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/hare- sir-thomas-1658-93 He was only 35 at his death and was buried in Stow Bardolph.

He was a wood merchant by profession, and a member of the Spartacus League. In November 1918, during the German Revolution, he was elected to the Leipzig Workers' and Soldiers' Council. Kästner was also a founding member of the Leipzig branch of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1919. When the KPD was banned in 1923–1924, underground meetings were held in Kästner's office. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Kästner's office was once again used for underground gatherings of KPD activists from Leipzig as well as nearby towns such as Chemnitz, Dresden and Riesa, and for printing illegal pamphlets. Kästner was arrested in September 1933; although he was sentenced to two years and eight months' imprisonment, he was interned in the concentration camps Sachsenburg, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald until 1939. After his release, Kästner joined the resistance group around Georg Schumann and maintained contact with resistance fighters in Hamburg, Bavaria and Württemberg.

Largely viewed as a negative process, the barrier effect has also been found to have several positive effects, particularly with smaller species. To reduce a road or railway's barrier effect, wildlife crossings are regarded as one of the best mitigation options, ideally in combination with wildlife fencing. The barrier effect is closely linked to habitat fragmentation and road ecology. Highway 10 in Quebec, Canada ==Effects on wildlife== ===Negative effects=== ====Roads==== Both existing roads and the construction of new highways act as barriers for many species, fragmenting the surrounding habitat to such a degree that connectivity, or the ability for an animal to travel to all areas of its home range, is made practically impossible. Generally, animals with a higher vagility, or ability to travel long distances, are more severely impacted by roads compared to species with smaller home ranges. ====Railways==== While very few studies have analyzed the effect of railways on animal movement, their presence across landscapes in most areas of the world suggests that they likely pose a significant barrier for many species. Most studies relating to this sub-field focus on animal use of drainage culverts underneath railway networks. For example, Rodriguez et al. (1996) found that nearly 80% of culverts in their study received visits by both mammals and reptiles. ====Land-use types==== Although few studies have analyzed the effect of land type on animal movement, those that exist have found man-made clearings and agricultural land to be strong barriers for many species who may only travel within forested landscapes. ===Positive effects=== 12% of studies analyzing the effects of roads on animals have found positive effects, indicating that some species benefit from the presence of roads. The predation release hypothesis, suggesting that roads may indirectly cause increases in abundances of animals whose predators are negatively affected by road, is often attributed to most positive effects of roads on animals. ==Mitigation measures== ===Driver behavior=== Studies have found that reducing the speed at which drivers travel along the road produces less noise, potentially reducing the road's barrier effect. The reduction in noise coming from the highway is assumed to make the road surface less intimidating for animals, potentially allowing crossings to take place. This increase in crossings, however, may result in a subsequent increase in animal-vehicle collisions. ===Animal movement=== Wildlife crossings, such as wildlife overpasses or underpasses, are generally seen as the most effective mitigation measure to help make roads more passable for wildlife while increasing both driver and animal safety. To funnel wildlife towards these crossings, many studies have called for a combination of both wildlife crossings and exclusion fencing, making the crossings under or over the road the only available path for wildlife. With a combination of both wildlife crossings and suitable lengths of fencing, the barrier effect of roads is expected to decrease, allowing animals to access both sides of the road and therefore allowing for important life cycle processes including migration and mating. ==References== Category:Landscape ecology ","title":"Road barrier effect"},{"id":"56711861","text":"Anthony Okpotu (born 3 March 1994) is a Nigerian international footballer who plays for Qatar, as a striker. ==Club career== Okpotu spent his early club football with Lobi Stars and Al-Ittihad Tripoli.

His father was descended from major merchants in Norwich during the Tudor era - Thomas' grandfather had bought Hardwick in Norfolk as his family seat and his father Peter had sat for Norwich between 1628 and 1629. Thomas remained neutral in the Civil War, but Peter raised two foot companies for the Royalists at his own expense during the English Civil War and served in the regiment of Sir Thomas Bridges of Somerset - he is recorded as a Lieutenant of Foot around 1643, possibly rising to Captain by 1645. During the Protectorate he continued to be suspected of Royalist sympathies and around 1650 he married Penelope Rodney (died 1690), daughter of Sir Edward Rodney of Rodney Stoke - the couple had two sons and one daughter. On the English Restoration in 1660 he became a major in the militia and a lieutenant in the volunteer horse, whilst the following year he succeeded his father and the following year he became a commissioner for \\"loyal and indigent officers\\". A baronetcy was created for him on 6 March 1666 during the 2nd Anglo-Dutch War, in which he served as Lieutenant Colonel of Lord Townshend's Regiment of Foot. He was Townshend's second in command and led the defence of Great Yarmouth. He became a commissioner for recusants in 1675 but he and Townshend were both removed from local office in 1676. During the Exclusion Crisis he actively favoured barring James, Duke of York from the succession for his Roman Catholicism. He then stood with Sir John Hobart for Norfolk in autumn 1679, gaining dissenters' support and beating the two pro-Charles II candidates. In his victory speech to the freeholders Gleane promised that: He was appointed to five committees during the Second Exclusion Parliament and was re-elected in 1681. This second election finally broke his finances, however, and in 1682 he erected his own tomb in the chancel of the church at Hardwick, though he was never buried in it. It is inscribed: In 1686 pressure was put on him to pay the £1095 fee for his baronetcy, but Laurence Hyde, 1st Lord of the Treasury quashed this. Matters were so dire just before his death that he had to sell Hardwick to Sir John Holland and his eldest son had to live off a £20 a year pension from the county rates until even that was withdrawn and he was thrown into the Fleet Prison.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/gleane- sir-peter-1619-96 He died in 1694 and was buried at Hardwick.

Henry Roraback in 1906 John Henry Roraback (April 5, 1870 – May 19, 1937) was an American lawyer, businessman, and Republican political boss in the state of Connecticut. He was one of the most influential figures in early 20th century Connecticut, and had a national impact as well. ==Early life== Roraback's father John C. Roraback was a farmer, the descendant of German immigrants from one of several settlements named \\"Rohrbach\\" in Lorraine who had settled in Columbia County, New York around 1700. He moved his family to Sheffield, Massachusetts in the Berkshires around 1846. Henry (as he seems to have been usually called) was born in 1870 in Sheffield, Massachusetts. He was educated in the local Sheffield schools and then attended high school in Great Barrington. At 19 he moved to North Canaan, Connecticut, where a number of his much older siblings were already established. Living with a sister there, he taught school nearby and studied law with his brother Alberto T. Roraback (1849-1923), a lawyer then serving as a county judge. He was admitted to the bar in 1892.Encyclopedia of American Biography (new series), Volume 11, ed. Winfield Scott Downs, New York: The American Historical Company, 1940, p. 142-144. He became a partner in his brother's prosperous practice. ==Political career== Roraback became the chairman of the Republican Town Committee in Canaan and promoted his brother's successful candidacy for the state House of Representatives in 1895. In 1898 he was elected to the Republican State Committee. In 1900 he supported George P. McLean for governor over Donald T. Warner (son of his brother's old mentor Judge Donald J. Warner) and carried Warner's own district for McLean. In 1909 Roraback managed Ebenezer Hill's campaign for the US Senate and nearly unseated Frank Brandegee. In 1910 he managed McLean's successful campaign for the Senate. In 1912 he became Republican state party chairman - a post he retained until his death in 1937. Under Roraback's leadership the Republicans retained the governorship from 1915 to 1931. Roraback's fiscally conservative policies led to Connecticut paying down its state debt. Roraback was elected to the Republican National Committee in 1920, a position he also held until his death. In 1924 he served as the speaker of the Republican national convention and became a member of the executive committee. In 1932 he became one of the vice-chairmen. By that time Roraback was regarded as one of the \\"Old Guard\\" of the party, opposed to reform and strongly opposed to Roosevelt's New Deal.The Coming of the New Deal, 1933-1935, Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003, p. 480 ==Business career== Starting in 1901 Roraback represented the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and was successful in protecting its interests. By 1905 Roraback had taken over and consolidated several small power companies serving Canaan and nearby areas into the Berkshire Power Company with himself as president. He obtained in 1905 a charter for the Rocky River Power Company to develop hydro power on the Housatonic River, rights which finally led to the organization of the Connecticut Light and Power Company in 1917 (with Roraback as president) and the construction of Candlewood Lake to store water and produce hydroelectric power in 1926-8. Roraback also served as president of a number of related power and utility concerns, and as a director of many Connecticut businesses. Around 1910 Roraback organized the New England Lime Company, a combination of a number of area lime kilns. ==Family and death== Roraback married Mary L. Parsons on April 29, 1896. The couple had twins in 1899, but one child died an infant; his son Lewis survived and on his death in the early 1980s donated 1,976 acres of land in Harwinton to the state of Connecticut, now the Roraback Wildlife Management Area. Roraback also had an illegitimate son, John Anthony Craig, by his long-time personal assistant Mary Collins. The Depression caused the Republicans to lose power in Connecticut, and Roraback's control of the party came under increased scrutiny and criticism. A throat infection in 1936 left Roraback in poor health, and he committed suicide on May 19, 1937, shooting himself in the head after a morning hunt with his son. His obituary in Time magazine said, > What Ohio's Marcus Alonzo (\\"Mark\\") Hanna did with the Republican Party > nationally during the single Presidential generation of William McKinley, > whipping Big Business to the Party treasury with fear of Bryan's silver > money, cajoling it with protective tariffs and other favors, Boss Roraback > did with controlled budgets, legislation favorable to industry, in > Connecticut during eight gubernatorial terms.

Ultimately, Robbie forgives her and they reconcile. ==Cast== *Abhishek Bachchan as Robbie Bhatia *Taapsee Pannu as Rumi Bagga *Vicky Kaushal as Vicky Sandhu *Ashnoor Kaur as Kiran *Vishavpreet kaur as Rumi's chachi *Saurabh Sachdeva as Kakaji *Vikram Kochhar as Robbie's brother *Arun Bali as Rumi's Grandfather *Neelu Kohli as Robbie's Mother *Swairaj Sandhu as Robbie's Father *Sukhmani Sadana as Lovely Singh *Rajinder Singh as Lawyer Bhalla *Jasmine Bajwa as Keerat *Rupinderjit Singh as Babloo *Akshay Arora as Rumi's Chacha *Gaurav Amlani as Raja *Toranj Kayvon as Raja's Girlfriend ==Production== The project was originally to be directed by Sameer Sharma, who had shot some portions of the film, but producer Aanand L. Rai was not happy with the rough cut and stopped the shooting. He then approached Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari to direct it, but she could not do it because of her \\"prior commitments\\". In November 2016, it was announced that Anurag Kashyap will now be directing Manmarziyaan written by Kanika Dhillon. Initially, it was reported by the media that Dulquer Salmaan, Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar were cast in the film, but they dropped out of the film. Abhishek Bachchan was then brought in as a replacement for Dulquer Salmaan. Abhishek Bachchan and Anurag Kashyap had differences in the past; one of the reasons being Kashyap's criticism of Bachchan's 2010 movie Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey. They had however resolved their differences and were excited to work together again when the opportunity arose. The movie marked Bachchan's return to acting after a 2 year hiatus. The film was shot in Punjab, while some portions in Delhi and Kashmir. ==Box office== Manmarziyaan was well received at the box office. It had a fair weekend at the box office as it managed to collect 4 crore on opening day. The film saw further jump in collections on Sunday as a result of which 5.70 crore more came in. The worldwide gross of the movie was 40.39 crore. == Reception == Manmarziyan received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the film for its contemporary take on a love story and the overall strong performances from its cast. Taapsee Pannu received universal praise for her performance as the mercurial Rumi. As a love-triangle with a running length of 155 minutes, the subject matter was a venture into conventional Bollywood territory for director Anurag Kashyap. Critic Anupama Chopra noted \\"director Anurag Kashyap, Hindi cinema’s high priest of darkness, turns his ferocious gaze on relationships. Obviously then, this is not the routine Bollywood meet cute. Director Anurag and writer Kanika Dhillon have created a fully realized world that is fueled by Amit Trivedi’s pulsating soundtrack\\" Times Of India's critic Rachit Gupta said \\"The maturity with which Anurag Kashyap’s Manmarziyaan talks about love and relationships is refreshing. The seemingly conventional story of a love triangle, gets original with its treatment and portrayal of love. With characters constantly oscillating between confusion and complex emotions, Manmarziyaan presents a new and updated look at romance and relationships.\\" Raja Sen, writing for Hindustan Times, critiqued the film saying \\"There is authenticity to the texture, but this film could have held more. It is ultimately a disappointment not because of its craft, but because of predictability, self-indulgent pace and its irritating attempt to be both a light crowd-pleaser with a cutesy ending as well as an impassioned, volatile romance.\\" Filmfare movie critic Debesh Sharma adds \\"Shot well by Sylvester Fonseca and edited well by Aarti Bajaj, the film scores on technical fronts as well.\\" The movie received a limited international release with the title \\"Husband Material\\" including a premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2018. The movie received high praise for seamlessly weaving its soundtrack into the story. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack of the film has been composed by Amit Trivedi while the lyrics are written by Shellee except where noted. The first song \\"F for Fyaar\\" was released on 10 August 2018. The second song \\"Daryaa\\" was released on 11 August 2018. The third song \\"Grey Walaa Shade\\" was released on 12 August 2018.

The ninth song \\"Bijlee Giregi\\" was released on 18 August 2018. The tenth song \\"Kundali\\" was released on 23 August 2018. Vipin Nair of The Hindu gave the soundtrack 4/5 stating that though the \\"repetitiveness gets in the way on more than one occasion, the composer still manages to deliver a supremely engaging soundtrack, with ample help from Shellee and a bunch of incredible musicians.\\" The Times of India based Debarati Sen, in her review, said the lyricist-composer combo ensures that the album \\"finds a way to your playlist.\\" == Awards and nominations == { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !

They were detained in Verdun. His father died and he returned to England in 1815. At some point he met Thomas Christopher Banks, genealogist and author of a book on the Extinct and Dormant Baronage of England, who became his adviser. ==The claim== Carlton Terrace, Edinburgh in 1838-39 The (then) Alexander Humphrys applied for a royal licence to take the surname Alexander in honour of his maternal grandfather, John Alexander. This was granted in 1824. Following that, he had himself declared the lawful heir of his mother by magistrates in Edinburgh in 1826. He then proceeded to claim the earldom as the descendant and heir of William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling (c. 1567–1640) on 11 October 1830, styling himself ‘Earl of Stirling and Dovan’. He then moved to claim the Canadian titles and property. These were originally restricted to the direct male line, but Humphrys-Alexander cited a special charter (or ‘Novodamus’) that Charles I had granted in 1639 which obviated this requirement. He was unable to prove the existence of this charter but nevertheless in June 1831, he successfully claimed his Canadian 'property' through the Sheriff of Edinburgh, and was 'invested' with them at Edinburgh Castle on 8 July 1831. He then proceeded to give Banks 16,000 acres of land in Canada and made him a baronet, e.g. Baronia Anglica Concentrata, Vol.1 followed by other attempts to make profitable use of his American interests. ==Trial for forgery== The ambitious scope of Humphrys-Alexander's activities inevitably involved the British government and eventually his claims were challenged, culminating in a celebrated trial in Edinburgh in 1839 in which he was accused of forgery. Eventually at least two of 17 documents were declared to be forgeries, however Humphrys-Alexander himself was acquitted of personal responsibility for making them, after which he left the country to live in Brussels, Paris and eventually America. He died in Washington on 4 May 1859. ==See also== *William Alexander, Lord Stirling ==References== ==Further reading== *Burn, J I (1833): Case of the Right Hon.

Azerbaijani women should be able to make these dumplings as tiny as possible, so that ten of them fit in a tablespoon. Dushbara is usually served with vinegar. * Etli dovga is a variety of dovga. The difference is that etli dovga has lamb meatballs in it. * Gurza is another variation of dumplings filled with meat. This dish is named after a snake which inhabits Absheron peninsula, because when the dough is folded around the meat it resembles the diamond pattern on the back of a gurza snake. Gurza is made of lamb. * Khamrashi is noodle soup. Noodles used for khamrashi are called arishta in Azerbaijani language. Khamrashi can be made with beef, lamb or chicken broth. * Khash is cow's-foot tendon stew or soup. It is a traditional Azerbaijani dish eaten on weekend mornings during winter. Khash has to be cooked for at least 8 hours, until the broth becomes very thick. Cow’s stomach and head may also be used for cooking khash. * Kyufta bozbash, the traditional Azerbaijani dish, is usually eaten during wintertime. It is made of ground beef or lamb formed into medium-sized balls. The word kyufta originates from the Persian word kuftan, which means 'to beat', because the meat for kyufta needs to be beaten before being formed into balls. The word bozbash comes from Turkish- Azerbaijani words boz, which is translated as 'gray', and bash which is translated as 'head'. It is served with a variety of vegetables. * Ovdukh is cold yoghurt and herb soup. Traditionally, it contains cucumber and herbs. Hard-boiled eggs and minced meat can sometimes be added. * Parcha bozbash is a variety of kyufta bozbash. The only difference is that parcha bozbash is made of large pieces of lamb. * Piti is the signature dish of the Sheki region of Azerbaijan. Piti is cooked in ceramic clay pots called dopu. It is traditionally made of chickpeas soaked in water overnight, lamb, onion, saffron, chestnut, dried plum and sheep tail fat. Piti should be eaten in two steps. First comes the soup with bread, then the remaining part. * Sabzi qovurma is a mixture of Persian and Turkish cooking. The word sabzi came into the Azerbaijani language from Iran. It is translated from Persian as 'green', and this word refers to herbs and vegetables. The word qovurma in Azerbaijani and Turkish means 'fried'. Traditionally, this dish is made of stewed meat and herbs, and is usually served with rice. *Sulu khingal is the national Azerbaijani dish, which can be served as either a first or second course. This dish should not be confused with Georgian khinkali, which is completely different. Sulu khingal is made of lamb, pieces of dough and chickpeas. Pieces of dough (called khingal) are cooked in meat broth together with meat. Sulu khingal is served with mint and wine vinegar. == See also == Azerbaijani cuisine == References == Category:Azerbaijani soups Category:Azerbaijani stews ","title":"List of Azerbaijani soups and stews"},{"id":"56712569","text":"The mass media in the Czech Republic refers to mass communication methods through broadcasting, publishing, and the Internet. == Overview == In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful \\"Velvet Revolution\\" (led by Václav Havel and his Civic Forum). In the following years the country, which became Czech Republic in 1993, went through a rapid economic transformation. This also affected the media that, on the other hand, became free of the heavy-handed control of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and was able to develop in a competitive environment (Steve Kettle, The development of the Czech media since the fall of communism Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics, Volume 12, 1996 - Issue 4: Post‐Communism and the Media in Eastern Europe, p. 42). However, before the revolution that set the country free from Soviet control, despite persecution there were illegally published magazines within the samizdat phenomenon, which permitted to circulate dissident ideas among people who possessed positions of cultural power and authority. Among them there was also Václav Havel, the last president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 until its dissolution in 1992. Since the Soviet Union’s dissolution, most Czech media outlets used to be owned by non- Czech western companies, while after the global economic recession of 2008 many were acquired by Czech firms. In early 2014, eight out of the ten most influential figures in the media were Czech or Slovak . In 2017 Freedom House[1] defined Czech Republic's press freedom status as “free\\", while the country ranks 23rd among 180 countries in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index prepared annually by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) . However RSF also underlines the fact that in recent years there have been a “rise of the oligharcs” in the media landscape. According to Freedom House, limits to the country’s media pluralism and independence are presented by concentration of media ownership and ownership by politicians. == Media outlets == === Print and online media === Czech Republic has four main daily newspapers: Lidové noviny (former dissident publication); Mladá fronta DNES (with a centre-right orientation); Právo (with a centre-left political position) and Blesk, all based in Prague. Both Lidové noviny and Mladá fronta DNES are a part of the MAFRA publishing group, owned by Andrej Babiš, the current Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. As of 2018, the MAFRA group is a part of a trust fund along with other Babiš's companies. Blesk, a tabloid newspaper, with more than 1 million readers per average issue is the most-read national daily. Blesk’s publisher Czech News Center also publishes Aha!, another tabloid newspaper which focuses on the news about the Czech celebrities. The daily has a right- wing stance and its major audience is represented by the Czech youth. Overall the country accounts for 7 print news outlets and over 20 online news portals. There has been a decline in circulation on Czech daily newspapers since 2009, which slowed down in 2016. In the same year Seznam Zpravy and Info.cz were launched. The first one, a news site combining daily video, text-based news and video commentaries, was introduced by the country’s leading web portal and second-biggest search engine Seznam.cz and has quickly become the top online news media in the country. On the other hand, Info.cz was launched by the Czech News Center as a news server with the aim of emphasising quality information. Finally, the Czech News Agency (Česká tisková kancelář, ČTK), previously the national state press agency, is the first and main Czech media with domestic and foreign information services. As it is not financed with state budget, its income derives from selling news to subscribers. === Television and radio === Commercial television has a major place in the Czech media landscape and attracts almost half of the total advertising spend. Before the collapse of communism, the only broadcaster in Czech Republic was “Czechoslovak television”, which was transformed into the public service broadcaster “Czech television” in 1992. Czech TV (ČT) operates two terrestrial public broadcast channels: mainstream CT1 and cultural channel CT2, while CT24 (for news) is a digital public channel. The first national commercial licence was granted to Television Nova in 1993. The TV station soon gained a dominant position on the television market managing to keep it so far. Prima televize is the second private national TV channel. Broadcast media regulatory authority is the Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting (RRTV), while public-service ČT is regulated by its own council. == Legal framework == Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are guaranteed by the 1992 Constitution, i.e. Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. In Division Two of the Charter, Article 17, these expression rights are defined: however, the Charter prohibits speech that might infringe on national security, individual rights, public health, or morality. Defamation is still a crime in the country, although in 2005 a Constitutional Court ruling found that value judgements are legally protected. Cross-ownership in the media industry is legally limited under the Law on Radio and Television Broadcasting No. 231 of 2001, which defines the license and regulation policy for broadcasting and the role of Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting. However, these ownership restrictions do not apply to foreign ownership and are considered to be “minimal” by some observers. Other important regulations are the Press Law (No. 46/2000), the Act on Czech Television No. 483 and the Act on Czech Radio No. 484. Both went into force in 1991 and have been amended several times. They provide on the so-called “small” councils that control only Czech Radio and Czech TV (ČT). Moreover, Law No. 106 of 1999 regulates the Free Access to Information, Law No. 45 of 1995 regulates Advertisements and the discipline regarding copyright is provided by Law No. 35 of 1996. == Media freedom and censorship == In 2017 Freedom House defined Czech Republic’'s press freedom status as “free\\", while according to Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index it is ranked 23rd among 180 countries. However in its 2016 report, Freedom House also states that criminal defamation, concentrated media ownership as well as ownership of media by politicians as the main obstacles for media freedom. Despite of the good ranking of Czech Republic in RSF’s media freedom chart, some relevant episodes concerning media freedom and censorship took place in the country: * Legislative ambiguities and contradictions emerged at the time of the banning of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf , in 2000. * In 2003 Karel Srba, a former general secretary of the Czech Foreign Ministry, has been convicted of plotting to murder Sabina Slonkova - – an investigative reporter of daily Mlada Fronta Dnes who had been writing about corruption inside the Ministry. * In 2011, a raid by military police took place in the offices of Czech Television in Prague. * In 2017, a leaked audio recording caught the leader of Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (Akce nespokojených občanů, ANO) party, former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Andrej Babiš, instructing a journalist on how to attack his political rivals. Many European parliamentarians condemned the alleged actions of Mr Babiš, but also stressed that this case resembles more a failure of a single politician, rather than a manifestation of the government’s systematic abuse of media. Moreover, some experts sustain a pro-Russian disinformation campaign is taking place in Czech Republic, which allegedly originates from multiple sources: numerous pro-Russian websites, social media communities, printed periodicals as well as radio broadcasts. == Media ownership == Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, all mass media in Czechoslovakia were governed by the state, state organisations or political parties. Since the Soviet Union’s dissolution, most Czech newspapers used to be owned by non-Czech western conglomerates: until 2007, 70% of Czech magazines and newspapers were owned by German and Swiss corporations. The process of the media returning to Czech ownership started with the 2008 financial crisis. The restructuring of ownership culminated in 2015 when the German Verlagsgruppe Passau, the last major non-Czech European media group in the country, left the market: it sold its local publishing house, Vltava-Labe- Press, to Penta Investments, which owns media holdings both in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. Despite this media ownership turmoil, research shows that journalists are not affected by the ownership change and tend to view journalism ethics and the ability of journalism to exert power more seriously than before. The new ownership structure of Czech media led to an increase in live news coverage, tabloid-style content and so-called “Google journalism”, although investigative journalism is still strong in the country. On the other hand, the increase of the ownership concentration represent a threat to the media pluralism of the country. Andrej Babiš, former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, owns two of the most influential daily newspapers (Lidové Noviny and Mlada Fronta Dnes) and one of the most popular news website (iDnes.cz). However, some experts consider the Czech Republic to be one of the hubs in the EU territory for the few Pan-European media companies controlling large part of broadcasting market in Europe. == See also == * List of newspapers in the Czech Republic * List of radio stations in the Czech Republic * Battle of Czechoslovak Radio == Further reading == * Min J.

Although he ran only twice as a two-year-old in 1900 he showed considerable potential when he dead-heated for first places in the July Stakes. In the following year he was a consistent performer at the highest class who contested all three legs of the Triple Crown. He finished second in the 2000 Guineas and the Newmarket Stakes but disappointed when coming home seventh in the Epsom Derby. He ran second again on his next start, before winning his next three races, culminating in a 40/1 upset victory in the St Leger Stakes. He failed to win again and was retired to become a breeding stallion in France. ==Background== Doricles was a \\"beautiful\\" brown horse bred in the United Kingdom. During his racing career he was owned by his breeder Leopold de Rothschild and trained by Alfred Hayhoe at the Palace House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Doricles was one of the first crop of foals sired by Florizel II, a high class racehorse and a brother to the Derby winners Persimmon and Diamond Jubilee. Doricles' dam Rosalie also produced St Rosalia, an influential broodmare whose descendants have included Kelso, Alysheba, Farma Way, Bel Bolide and Quiet Reflection. ==Racing career== ===1900: two-year-old season=== Doricles made his debut in the 48th Triennial Stakes at Ascot Racecourse and finished third behind Veles and Lord Melton. At Newmarket Racecourse on 3 July, Doricles was ridden by Tommy Loates in the July Stakes over five and a half furlongs and started at odds of 10/1. In a \\"fine race\\" Doricles dead-heated for first place with Veles with Handicapper among the unplaced finishers. ===1901: three-year- old season=== Doricles' owner Leopold de Rothschild On 1 May 1901 Doricles made his three-year-old debut in the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Nemarket and started second favourite behind Veles at odds of 4/1. After racing the leaders for most of the way he made steady headway in the last quarter mile, but was never able to get on terms with the 33/1 outsider Handicapper and finished second, beaten two lengths with Osboch in third. Two weeks later at the next Newmarket meeting the colt was moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs and finished second, beaten a head by William the Third, with the 1000 Guineas winner Aida in third, after what was described as \\"one of the finest struggles ever seen\\". In the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles on 5 June Doricles came home seventh of the twenty- five runners behind Volodyovski. On 23 July at Liverpool the colt started 5/2 favourite for the eleven furlong Saint George Stakes, but was beaten a length into second place by Fortunatus. At Brighton Racecourse on 7 August Doricles recorded his first success for over a year when he won the ten furlong Brighton Cup \\"easily\\" from four opponents. A week before running in the St Leger the colt won again, taking the Champion Breeders' Biennial Foal Stakes at Derby Racecourse by half a length at odds of 4/7. On 11 September Doricles, ridden by Kempton Cannon, started a 40/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field for the 126th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Volodyovski started the 5/6 favourite while the other runners included Fortunatus, Veronese (Prince of Wales's Stakes), Jacobite (Grand Prix de Deauville), Aida and the Irish-bred Revenue. After settling behind leaders for most of the way, Doricles moved into contention in the straight, gained the advantage approaching the final furlong, and fought off the challenge of Volodyovski to win by a neck. Revenue was three lengths back in third place ahead of Pietmaritzburg. Lester Reiff, the rider of the runner- up, lodged an objection to the winner on the grounds of \\"bumping\\", but the racecourse stewards upheld the result. The colt's victory was a first classic success for Cannon and the winning time 3.08.4 was a new record for the race. The Kempton Park Stakes in October attracted a very strong field and saw Doricles finish fourth behind the four-year-old gelding Epsom Lad. Later that month the colt ran in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket and finished third of the three runners behind Osboch and Pietmaritzburg. Doricles ended the year with earnings of £6,955, making him the fifth most successful racehorse of the season. ===1902: four-year-old season=== Doricles remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover his best form. In early spring he was beaten by St Maclou in a Biennial Stakes at Newmarket, and then ran unplaced behind First Principal in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Doricles an \\"average\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== Doricles was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in France at the stud of the Duc de Gramont. The most notable of his offspring was Consols, who sired the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Massine. He died at the stud of Mr. Prat in 1916. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:1898 racehorse births Category:1916 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 20 Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Doricles"},{"id":"56712593","text":"Filotas Pellios (; born 22 March 1953) is a retired Greek footballer.

He was one of the victims of the December murders. == Biography == Hoost studied at the Law School in Suriname with Hugo Pos and Harold Riedewald.Hugo Pos wil de vraagtekens weg hebben, Amigoe, 23 June 1990 In 1970, together with Eddy Bruma and Roy Adama, he founded the trade union Centrale-47 (C-47), after mass strikes in 1969, demanded a new and more progressive type of labor organization. C-47 became largest trade union in Suriname, after the Mother Union, a trade union closely connected with the National Party of Suriname. In 1973, Hoost became Minister of Justice and Police in the first National Party Combination (NPK I) cabinet, headed by Henck Arron, on behalf of the Nationalist Republican Party (PNR). The primary agenda of the PNR was the preparation of Suriname for independence. Once in government, negotiations started with the Dutch government headed by Prime Minister Joop den Uyl. Hoost was part of Surinamese delegation to negotiate the exit out of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. From 1954 until independence, Suriname was, like the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles, officially an equal partner within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but foreign affairs and defense were kingdom affairs. As the Justice minister, Hoost was responsible for the transition of the TRIS (Dutch Forces in Suriname) into the Surinamese Armed Forces (SKM). After independence on November 25, 1975, Hoost became the first Minister of Defense. During the electoral campaign for the 1977 elections, the PNR ended co-operation with the NPS. In 1980, a military coup took place in Suriname under the leadership of Dési Bouterse. In 1981, Hoost, together with other former ministers of the NPK I and II, was arrested on charges of corruption. The detainees were tortured and eventually released without a fair trial. He was finally released in 1982. On March 11, 1982, army officers Surendre Rambocus, Jiwansingh Sheombar and Wilfred Hawker staged a counter-coup. The insurgency failed and Hawker was executed, while Rambocus and others were arrested. Hoost, together with the lawyers John Baboeram and Harold Riedewald, took on the defense of Rambocus at his court-martial. On December 3, the court sentenced Rambus to 12 years in prison with forced labor. In the early morning of 8 December 1982, Hoost, Baboeram, Riedewald and 11 others were arrested and imprisoned in Fort Zeelandia, while Rambocus and Sheombar were transferred from the Memre Boekoe barracks, Santo Boma prison to Fort Zeelandia. An undisclosed number of individuals were executed, including Hoost. The only survivor was trade union leader Fred Derby, who was freed. Hoost is buried at the Mariusrust cemetery. Hoost was married. He was father of three daughters and one son. == Notes == == References == * René de Groot, Drie miljard verwijten: Suriname los van Nederland 1974-1980, 2004, == External links == * Eddy Hoost (21 oktober 1934 - 8 december 1982) Radio Nederland Wereldomroep, 5 April 2007 * Suriname (Case No. 1160) (Committee on Freedom of Association Report; 1983) * Eddie Hoost: 21 oktober 1934 — 8 december 1982 Advocaat, deken van advocaten * Eddy Hoost (1934) advocaat Category:1934 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Assassinated Surinamese politicians Category:December murders Category:Government ministers of Suriname Category:Murdered lawyers Category:People murdered in Suriname Category:Surinamese lawyers Category:Nationalist Republican Party (Suriname) politicians Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Eddy Hoost"},{"id":"56712620","text":"Gennady Andreyevich Sapunov (; born 5 December 1938) was a Greco-Roman wrestler from Russia.

Built on an awkward and steeply sloping site, it is a masterpiece of urban planning. With generous plots accommodating huge townhouses it has accommodated the rich and famous from its outset. ==Background== Detailing on the Moray Estate The ground, extending to 5.3 hectares, was acquired in 1782 by the 9th Earl of Moray from the Heriot Trust.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker The land contained Drumsheugh House and large gardens lying between Charlotte Square and the Water of Leith. In 1822 his son, Francis Stuart, 10th Earl of Moray, commissioned the architect James Gillespie Graham to draw up plans to build over 150 huge townhouses on the land. The houses were set on large plots, even by surrounding New Town standards, and were complemented by a series of private gardens, most notably on the slopes of the Water of Leith. Sales were begun (from plan) by auction on 7 August 1822. Over and above the cost of the plot, purchasers agreed to a build cost of £2000 to £3000 (depending on the plot) and an annual fee of £30. A \\"penalty clause\\" also imposed a fine of £100 on buildings not completed within 30 months. If comparing these prices to the norm, even for the affluent New Town this was perhaps ten times more than might have been expected. While the houses were among the largest ever built, this clearly guaranteed an exclusivity from the outset. While the majority of plots sold well and quickly (some of the corner plots were less popular, mostly being completed in the 1850s) the scheme as a whole was completed in 1858. The final phase included a central section on Great Stuart Street on the east side between Ainslie Place and Randolph Place, and the two corner blocks on Ainslie Place flanking the access to St Colme Street/Albyn Place.1852 OS map As one of the most affluent areas in Edinburgh, it set a trend. Glazing was changed to one-over-one format over almost the entire estate by 1950, but when architectural conservation came to the fore in the 1970's, it was one of the first areas to almost wholly restore windows to their original form. Most basements throughout the estate are now separate properties and many of the blocks are divided into flats. The entire scheme was designed as a residential enclave with the exception of Wemyss Place, which had ground floor commercial properties and a church in its centre. This church, by John Thomas Rochead does not look like a church and blends very well with the street. It was originally St Stephen's Free Church created in 1845 for Rev Gillies. Whilst intended as residential many properties became commercial through the years and by the 1970s these commercial uses exceeded 50%. This has reversed in recent years. The gas lighting was not part of the original design. The current form was created by John Kippen Watson in the 1860s was mainly removed and replaced by modern electric lighting in the 1960s. Edinburgh's New Town Conservation Area Committee restored electric versions of the original lamps in the 1980s and these are highly appropriate in appearance. ==Form== The general form of the estate is as four storey and basement houses, set back behind the front basement area, and with a private garden to the rear. The continuous form necessitates a different solution on the corner blocks: these generally have a ground floor and basement duplex unit accessed from the more important street and flats above accessed from the secondary street. These either have no garden or a detached garden. From the pavement a flight of steps gives independent access to the basement, generally a service area. A short flight of steps rise to the main entrance, usually supported on a stone arch. The buildings are constructed of local Craigleith sandstone with roofs of Scots slate with lead flashings. The typical interior has a grand open staircase built in stone topped by an ornate cupola giving it daylight, and often embellished with ornate plasterwork. The main room for public entertainment was usually the first floor front room. ==Gardens== Horonised pavement, Moray Place Moray Place Gardens The Bank Gardens between the estate and the Water of Leith extend to 4.1 acres and slope steeply and were raised further to level the estate. A virtually inevitable landslip occurred at the back of the Ainslie Place feus in 1825 and had to be rectified by the addition of structural arches by James Jardine. A further landslip in the south-west corner in 1837 required further arches and these were then re-invented as a high level walkway leading to Dean Bridge. However the southern section of the Bank Gardens did not become fully operational until 1840. Over and above the Bank Gardens two other substantial private gardens were created: Moray Place Gardens and Ainslie Place Gardens. Of these Moray Place Gardens is sufficiently large and sufficiently screened to provide tennis courts and croquet lawns. The several garden areas remain the private joint property of the Moray Estate owners (often called the Moray Feuars). The pavements around the gardens are of \\"horonised\\" form. This is created from a series of vertical slivers of granite, created by the squaring of the granite setts on the vehicle surface, thereby making full use of the material. ==Moray Place== Moray Place, Edinburgh Appearing as a circle but actually a duodecagon this is the largest and grandest space within the plan. Technically it is symmetrical around its northwest/southeast axis, but the scale of the form and central gardens makes this impossible to interpret on the ground, and this is only visible from above. Although rear mews were standard at the time of building, the layout only permitted mews on the north-east side (now known as Gloucester Lane). Lord Moray took one of the largest and most prominent houses: 28 Moray Place. Other notable residents included Alexander Kinnear, 1st Baron Kinnear (2), George Deas, Lord Deas (3), Sir David Baxter of Kilmaron (5), Charles Dundas Lawrie (5), John Learmonth (6), John Sinclair, 1st Baron Pentland (6), Charles Hope, Lord Granton (12), Robert MacFarlane, Lord Ormidale and his son George Lewis MacFarlane (14), John MacGregor McCandlish (18), John Hope, Lord Hope (20), Francis Brown Douglas (Lord Provost) (21), Bouverie Francis Primrose (22), Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey (24), George Young, Lord Young (28), Andrew Coventry and his son George Coventry FRSE (29), Thomas Charles Hope (31), Sir James Miles Riddell (33), John Fullerton, Lord Fullerton (33), Baron Hume (34), Robert Kerr, Lord Kerr (38), Robert Christison and his son Sir Alexander Christison (40), William Thomas Thomson and his son Spencer Campbell Thomson (41), Thomas Jamieson Boyd (Lord Provost) (41), James Skene (46), Sir James Wellwood Moncreiff, 9th Baronet (47), John Corse Scott (48), Rev George Coventry (49)Edinburgh Post Office Directories 1835 to 1910 ==Ainslie Place== Ainslie Place, Edinburgh Named after the Earl's wife, Margaret Jane Ainslie, daughter of Col. Sir Philip Ainslie of Pilton, Ainslie Place stands in the centre of the scheme. The format is an oval circus laid on a south-west to north-east axis, between the two halves of Great Stuart Street. The scheme has always been popular with Scottish law lords and eminent physicians. Notable residents include John Millar, Lord Craighill (2), William Blackwood (3), Edward Maitland, Lord Barcaple (3), John MacWhirter (physician) (4), John Cowan, Lord Cowan (4), Mark Napier (historian) (6), Reginald Fairlie (office at 7), John Duncan (surgeon) (8), Alexander Bruce (neurologist) (8), James Ivory, Lord Ivory (9), James Gregory and his eminent sons Donald, William, Duncan and James all at 10, Sir William Edmonstone (11), George Cranstoun, Lord Corehouse (12), John Hay Forbes, Lord Medwyn (17), James Spence (surgeon) and George Burnett, Lord Lyon (21), Neil Kennedy, Lord Kennedy (22), Francis Cadell (artist) and his actress sister Jean Cadell (22), John Rankine (legal author) (23), Dean Edward Ramsay and his brother Admiral Sir William Ramsay (23) in later life (see Darnaway St), Very Rev James Robertson (25) ==Randolph Crescent== The rear of Randolph Crescent and Randolph Cliff as seen from Dean Bridge over the Bank Gardens This street forms the entrance into the estate from the south. Randolph Crescent Garden was originally retained by Lord Moray and Graham's plan showed a large mansion in the centre, probably as a replacement to Drumsheugh House. It was ultimately decided this was not a good location to build. The elevated ground level in the central garden is partly due to the placing of excess soil here during original construction. It facilitated a large air raid shelter being constructed here during the Second World War.Edinburgh: location of air raid shelters 1940 Notable residents include Edward Gordon, Baron Gordon of Drumearn (2), William Mackintosh, Lord Kyllachy (6), Robert Smith Candlish (9), Erskine Douglas Sandford (11), William Campbell, Lord Skerrington (12), and James Stevenson and his daughters Flora and Louisa (13). ==Randolph Cliff== Randolph Cliff, Edinburgh The dramatic entrance to the Moray Estate from Dean Bridge begins with Randolph Cliff, which stands dramatically over the Water of Leith far below. It was one of the final sections to be completed (and quite an engineering feat) and is laid out as flats rather than houses. The corner block as a complex stair to access the main stair, unlike any other block on the estate. ==Randolph Place== Somewhat detached from the rest of the estate, Randolph Place never had the same allure as housing and from the outset seems to have attracted office use. Two famous architects had their offices here: Alexander Hunter Crawford at 10 and Reginald Fairlie at 14.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1910 ==Great Stuart Street== Great Stuart Street, Edinburgh Split into two halves by Ainslie Place, this street is named after the Earl's family name of Stuart and his additional title of Baron Stuart (granted in 1796). It forms the links between the main sections of the estate. Notable residents include Dr Alexander Monro (1), Sir Robert Christison (3), Harold Stiles (9), John Murray, Lord Murray (11), Lt Gen Thomas Robert Swinburne (13), James Warburton Begbie (16), William Edmonstoune Aytoun (16) and William Henry Playfair (17). ==Doune Terrace== Doune Terrace, Edinburgh Named after the Earl's country estate of Doune and family title (from 1581) of Lord Doune, this street links Moray Place to the lower streets around Stockbridge. Notable residents include James Craufurd, Lord Ardmillan (2) and Thomas Balfour, James Kinnear and James Pitman, Lord Pitman (9) . ==St Colme Street== This street is named after the family title of Lord St Colme (granted in 1611) and links Ainslie Place to Queen Street. Notable residents include George Angus (architect) (1), Thomas Guthrie Wright (6), Helen Kerr (6), and Andrew Rutherfurd, Lord Rutherfurd (9). Harold Tarbolton had his office at no.4 and was later joined by Matthew Ochterlony. Lord Rutherfurd employed William Notman to remodel his building in 1835, soon after it was built. ==Albyn Place== Albyn Place, Edinburgh Named after Glen Albyn on the Aberdeenshire estates, this short section is a continuation of St Colme Street linking to Queen Street. Notable residents include William Forbes Skene founded Skene Edwards WS (offices at 5), Aeneas James George Mackay (7), David Mure, Lord Mure (8), Prof Thomas Stewart Traill (10), Prof David Low (11) ==Darnaway Street== Named after the family seat of Darnaway Castle, this short street links Moray Place to Heriot Row, then and still an exclusive Edinburgh address. Notable residents include Thomas Duncan (painter) (1), William Kirk Dickson (3), George Joseph Bell (6), Edward Ramsay (7), Archibald Campbell Swinton and his son George Swinton (7), John Steell (11) and Robert Matthew (12). ==Forres Street== 1 Forres Street, Edinburgh Named after the family estate of Forres, this street connects Moray Place to Charlotte Square. Notable residents include Thomas de Quincey (1), Thomas Chalmers (3), Robert Omond (4), John Montgomerie Bell (4), Ramsay Traquair (4), Sir Alexander Kinloch (5), David Paulin (6) and Archibald Fleming (9), James Maidment (10). ==Glenfinlas Street== Named after the family rural estate of Glenfinlas in the Trossachs, this short street formed the north-west connection to Charlotte Square and appears a completion of the square. Due to boundary/ownership issues between the Moray Estate and Charlotte Square the final block was not completed until the late 20th century (the only block built as an office). Notable residents include John Hughes Bennett (1). ==Wemyss Place== Named after the Earl of Moray's step-mother, Lady Margaret Wemyss, daughter of David Wemyss, 4th Earl of Wemyss Wemyss Place is peripheral to the estate and visually links more to Queen Street and Heriot Row. It is one of the few sections built with a mews (accessed through a central pend). The central block was built as St Stephen's Free Church and in WW2 its open interior allowed use as a drill hall for Edinburgh's Home Guard and rather ridiculously (under the wartime rules) had to be painted in camouflage colours (making it very obvious). Repainted grey after the war it was only restored to natural stone in the late 20th century. Notable residents include George Smith (Scottish architect) (8), William Guy (dentist) and John Smith (dentist) (11) ==References== Category:Areas of Edinburgh Category:New Town, Edinburgh ","title":"Moray Estate"},{"id":"56712841","text":"At the Bardo may refer to: * Near-East museums: ** Bardo National Museum (Tunis), in suburbs of Le Bardo, Tunisia ** The Bardo National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography, former palace a.k.a.

She grew up in a home in which drunkenness and crime were commonplace, and received her first criminal conviction at the age of 19. She was arrested for theft, along with fellow prostitutes Kate Driscoll and Selina Rushbrook, in 1905. She was found not guilty, and the experience appears to have deterred her from a life of crime; she instead became a prostitute. Following the death of her mother in 1906 Argent descended into alcoholism. In 1913 she married Michael John Bumster, the son of the owners of the boarding house in which she was living. The relationship was to be brief, as less than a year later her husband enlisted in the army on the outbreak of the First World War. Lily Bumster, by this time suffering severe tuberculosis, died in late 1916. In her lifetime, Argent attracted little notice beyond official records and local newspaper accounts. Her life was examined by local historian Elizabeth Belcham in her book Swansea's 'Bad Girls': Crime and Prostitution 1870s–1914. ==Early life== Lily Argent was born on 8 October 1886 in Swansea. Her parents were William Argent, a local stonemason, and Margaret Argent née Webb, a servant in an eating house in Cross Street, Swansea; the family lived in Madoc Street, Swansea. Lily was the second of the Argents' six children. Throughout Lily's childhood, Margaret Argent and her sisters Annie Price, Harriet Griffiths and Elizabeth Winter made regular appearances in the courts for alcohol-related public order offences. The young Lily Argent grew up in an environment in which drunkenness, crime and violence was commonplace. She made the first of her many appearances in court in October 1898, when she testified on behalf of her mother in a case in which labourer James Davies was accused of breaking Margaret Argent's leg; Davies denied the charges, claiming that Margaret Argent had sustained the injuries falling over while trying to attack him. ==Adult life== In August 1905, having moved out of the family home in the intervening years, the 19-year-old Lily Argent received her first criminal conviction, a prosecution for drunkenness. As was customary at the time for a first offence, she was discharged on condition she enter the local workhouse. Within weeks she was arrested again and given a 10s fine (about £ in terms) for fighting in the High Street. By this time she had been discharged from the workhouse and was lodging in The Strand in Swansea. As a young woman with no means of support these arrests did not discourage her from crime, and on 17 November that year she was arrested, along with her friends Selina Rushbrook and Catherine Driscoll (both well-known local thieves and prostitutes), for the theft of a sea captain's purse containing £5 10s (about £ in terms). On this occasion, all three were found not guilty of the theft on grounds of insufficient evidence. It appears that this narrow escape finally turned Lily Argent away from a life of crime, and she was never again to be arrested for theft, although she continued to work as a prostitute. In 1906 Margaret Argent died from cerebral softening and eclampsia. Her daughter gradually became an alcoholic, and in May 1909, after not coming to the notice of the authorities for over three years, Lily Argent was again arrested for riotous behaviour and imprisoned for a month. She was arrested yet again for drunkenness in February and December 1910; on the latter occasion, the arresting officer described her as \\"using most abusive and indecent language\\". ==Marriage and death== By this time Argent was living in Michael and Margaret Bumster's boarding-house at 68 Strand, and continuing to work as a prostitute. Along with fellow prostitute Annie Boatwright, she was one of only two unmarried female boarders in an otherwise entirely male establishment. In November 1913 Argent married the Bumsters' son, Michael John Bumster. Their relationship was to be brief; on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Michael John Bumster—who had previous military training—enlisted in the army. On 26 October 1914 Lily Bumster was again prosecuted for assault, the last of her arrests. On 13 December 1916, by this time suffering from severe tuberculosis, Lily Bumster died of cardiac failure, aged 30. She was buried, along with her parents, in the family plot in Danygraig cemetery. == See also == *Contagious Diseases Acts *Inebriates Act 1898 ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:Welsh female prostitutes Category:People from Swansea Category:20th- century Welsh criminals Category:1886 births Category:1916 deaths ","title":"Lily Argent"},{"id":"56713386","text":"Meloria south end Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located in the Ligurian Sea, west of the south entrance of the Port of Livorno, in the southern part of the Meloria shoal. ==Description== Because the Meloria Tower has not been an active lighthouse for a long time, on May 15, 1867 at from the Tower, a high metal structure lighthouse was built.

Married twice, he fathered 15 children. One marriage was to a cousin, Anne Cary, with whom they had 13 children. His second marriage, which resulted in two children, caused a dissention among family members. The youngest son, with the same name as his half-brother, Thomas Mann Randolph, inherited the family plantation, Tuckahoe plantation. Randolph expanded upon the house that began to be built during his parent's short marriage. Orphaned as a young boy, Randolph continued work on Tuckahoe when he came of age. He also purchased Salisbury house, which was used during his lifetime as a hunting lodge. ==Early life== Randolph was the only son of William Randolph III (1712–1745) and Maria Judith Page (died 1744), the daughter of Mann Page of the Rosewell plantation. The Randolph family of Virginia were among the First Families of Virginia. He was the grandson of Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe and descendant of William Randolph (c.1650–1711). Randolph's parents were married in 1736 and her father provided a £2000 sterling dowry that was used to built an \\"elegant new two-story mansion. By 1742, Maria Page Randolph had died. William Randolph died in 1745. William Randolph stipulated in his will of late 1745 that he wanted his good friend Peter Jefferson and his first cousin and Peter's wife, Jane Randolph Jefferson, to take care of his son and two daughters at Tuckahoe Plantation and provide the children a good education until Thomas Mann Randolph came of age. Peter Jefferson also managed the plantation's business affairs. The Jeffersons left their residence at Shadwell, Virginia, with their three daughters and son, Thomas Jefferson, in 1746. Second cousins, Randolph and Thomas Jefferson were close during their childhood at Tuckahoe. The boys were tutored at Tuckahoe on English spelling, grammar, and composition. Thomas Jefferson maintained relationships with his Randolph family members, particularly the Randolphs at Tuckahoe. ==Marriages and children == Tuckahoe Plantation - view of the Whole House. In 1761, Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. married Anne Cary (1745–1789), the daughter of Archibald Cary and Mary Randolph Cary of Ampthill. Anne and Thomas were second cousins. He came of age in 1762. Randolph worked on construction of the mansion sometime between 1760 and 1765, perhaps partially funded by a dowry for his wife. The house came to have an h-shaped layout, with a north wing, hyphen, and a south wing. The mansion was built for a large family and entertaining. Construction was completed by 1769 when Englishman Thomas Anburey visited Tuckahoe. He wrote that the mansion Ann Cary and Thomas Mann Randolph had thirteen children, which include: * Mary Randolph (1762–1828), married David Mead Randolph, she was the author of The Virginia House-Wife (1824) * Henry Cary Randolph, born about 1763 and died as an infant * Elizabeth Randolph, born about 1765, married Robert Pleasants of Filmer about 1785 * Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. (October 1, 1768 – June 20, 1828) an American planter, soldier, and politician, including Governor of Virginia. Married Martha Jefferson * William Randolph, born about 1769, married Lucy Bolling, the daughter of Beverley Randolph about 1794 * Archibald Cary Randolph, born about 1771, died an infant * Judith Randolph, born about 1773, married Richard Randolph of the Bizarre plantation and tried for the Bizarre plantation scandal * Ann Cary \\"Nancy\\" Randolph (1774–1837), wife of Gouverneur Morris. Nancy was harassed throughout her life because of an alleged unwed teenage pregnancy and subsequent suspicion of abortion that was detailed in a sensational murder trial at the time where she was defended by both John Marshall and Patrick Henry who secured her acquittal for lack of evidence. She later claimed a stillborn birth had occurred after a member of her own family relentlessly pursued her in the court of public opinion. * Jane Cary Randolph, born about 1777, married Thomas Eston Randolph of Bristol, England about 1797 *Dr. John Randolph, born about 1779, married Judith Lewis * George Washington Randolph, born about 1781, died an infant * Harriet Randolph, born about 1783, married Richard S. Hackley of New York about 1803 * Virginia Randolph Cary (1786–1852), author of Letters on Female Character (1828) Ann Cary Randolph died in 1789. In 1790, a few months after his first wife's death, the 49-year- old Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. married Gabriella Harvie, the daughter of John Harvie, Jr. She was 17 years of age, and he was more than twice her age. The children of Gabriella Harvie and Thomas Mann Randolph are: * A baby daughter who died while an infant. * Thomas Mann Randolph (1792–1848), was born before 1793 when Randolph died. This son had the same name as the son of his first wife which caused a great deal of division among the family. The children from Randolph's first marriage did not visit Tuckahoe after the second marriage. ==Career== Randolph served during the Revolutionary War where he acquired the name \\"Colonel Randolph\\". He served in the Virginia House of Burgesses, the Revolutionary conventions of 1775 and 1776, and the Virginia state senate in 1776. \\"Mary Randolph at Feeding America\\" He was a member of the House of Delegates from 1784 to 1788 and was County Lieutenant of Goochland County. ==Salisbury house== In 1777, Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. purchased the Salisbury house from Abraham Salle (a Huguenot descendant of Abraham Salle (1670–ca. 1719)). The estate in Chesterfield County, Virginia (14 miles from Richmond, directly across the River from the Randolph-owned Tuckahoe) became a Randolph family hunting lodge. In 1784 Patrick Henry lived at Salisbury during his second term as Virginia governor (1784 to 1786). ==Death== Randolph died on November 13, 1793. The second Thomas Mann Randolph, Gabriella's son, inherited Tuckahoe. After Randolph's death, Gabriella married Dr. John Brockenbrough of Richmond by 1798. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1741 births Category:1793 deaths Category:People from Virginia Category:House of Burgesses members Category:Randolph family of Virginia Category:18th-century American politicians ","title":"Thomas Mann Randolph Sr."},{"id":"56713725","text":"Yorkshire Grey may refer to: *Yorkshire Grey Horse *The Yorkshire Grey, a name of a public house ","title":"Yorkshire Grey"},{"id":"56713769","text":"Istituto Champagnat, Genoa is a school in Genoa, Italy.

The Admiralty purchased her in June and the Royal Navy took her into service to use her as a convoy escort. Then in 1809 it converted her into a storeship. After the Admiralty sold her in 1817, she resumed the Blenheim name and returned to mercantile service as a West Indiaman. She disappeared after 10 November 1821 and was presumed to have foundered. ==Blenheim== Blenehim, of 327 tons (bm), only enters the Register of Shipping in 1806. It gives her master as Lamb, her owner as Hurry & Co., and her trade as Shields–London.Register of Shipping (18105), Seq.№B360. She does not appear in Lloyd's Register. ==HMS Cormorant== The Admiralty purchased Blenheim in June 1804. Blenheim underwent surveying by Perry & Co., Blackwall, between 26 May and 8 June 1804. The Admiralty purchased her in June, and she then underwent fitting at Woolwich between 8 June and 30 July. In June Commander James Stewart commissioned Cormorant for the North Sea. On 20 August 1805 Cormorant captured Liefde. Cormorant sent Liefde, Geret, master, into Yarmouth. Liefde had been sailing from Husum to Amsterdam.Lloyd's List №4249. Lloyd's List reported on 23 August that Cormorant had sent into Yarmouth Vrow Jan___. She had been carrying a cargo of indigo to Embden.Lloyd's List №4247. In October 1805 Commander John Phillimore replaced Stewart.Marshall (1827), Supple. Part 1, p.243. On 11 March 1806 Cormorant and were in company at the capture of Minerva. Phillimore left Cormorant in October, and Commander William Hughes replaced him. On 13 February 1807 Cormorant recaptured the brig Hope. The French privateer lugger Revanche, of Cherbourg, had captured Hope, Blake, master, off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, that day as Hope was returning to London from Madeira. Hope arrived at Portsmouth within the day.Lloyd's List №4127. Hughes sailed Cormorant in March 1807 to the Cape of Good Hope. On 26 January 1808 she captured the Dutch East Indiaman Marianne. Cormorant sent Marian, Kofoed, master, into the Cape on 8 February. She had been sailing from Batavia to Copenhagen.Lloyd's List №4252. The Vice admiralty court at the Cape condemned Marianne and remitted £40,000 to the Registry of the High Court of Admiralty in London.Commander Hughes's share of the proceeds would have been at least £10,000, an amount in excess of 40 years salary. The fewer than 50 able and ordinary seamen, landsmen, and marines would have shared £5,000 equally, which compares with the annual wage for an ordinary seaman of about £22. This was only a partial payment. A second, more minor, disbursement, occurred later. Cormorant also detained and sent into the Cape three American vessels:Lloyd's List №4251. *Bellisarius, Wilde, master, from Batavia *Telemachus, Gallop, master, from Manila *Resolution, Cracraft, master, from Île de France Between October 1808 and July 1809 Cormorant underwent fitting as a storeship. She was recommissioned in April. However, Lloyd's List reported on 24 March 1809 that the sloop-of-war Cormorant had detained Batavia, sailing from Rochelle to New York. Batavias crew regained possession of her, but then the letter of marque detained Batavia again.Letter of Marque, p.69 - accessed 25 July 2017. Irlam came into Liverpool, from where she went on to Barbados.Lloyd's List №4338. A later report credited with the first capture, not Cormorant, and reported that Batavias master, cook, and steward had recaptured Batavia, this time from Irlams prize crew, and had taken Batavia into New York, her original destination.Lloyd's List №4346. In 1813 Mr. W. Kirby was Cormorants master. He sailed her to the Cape in company with , which was sailing to the East Indies. On the way, on 11 June, they boarded Ainsley, Brown, master, which was returning to Liverpool from Africa.Lloyd's List №4791. Cormorant returned to Portsmouth on 18 December. She had sailed from the Cape on 5 September, and from Saint Helena on 23 October. She had been in company with a number of whalers and other vessels, including .Lloyd's List №4831. In 1814 Cormorant sailed to Newfoundland. In 1815 Mr. T. Hodgson became her master.

In 1862, he married Sarah Helen Margaret Graham, daughter of George Templar Graham and Frances Margaret Golightly, and together they had seven children: * Horace Graham Kennedy (born 1863) * George Portalés (died as an infant) * Tristram Edward Whiteside Kennedy (born 1866) * Pitt Shadwell Portalés Kennedy (1868–1911) * Francis Malcolm Evory Kennedy (born 1869), an officer in the Worcestershire Regiment * Theodora (died as an infant) * Caroline Mary Dorothea Kennedy (born 1880) ==Legal career== He was educated at Derry Free Grammar School, becoming an attorney and then, in 1828, High Sheriff of Londonderry City. In that role, he chaired a lengthy and controversial debate between Protestant and Catholic clergyman, winning admiration from both sides. However, in 1829, he was struck off the roll of attorneys, and entered Lincoln's Inn and King's Inns in Dublin, before being called to the bar of Ireland in 1834, aiming to improve legal education standards. In doing this, he opened the Dublin Law Institute in 1839, starting the education of a subject not taught systematically in Ireland for at least 200 years. This campaign to reform legal education was widely supported, and helped by Waterford City MP Thomas Wyse. It was also said to stimulate the academic study of English law at British and Irish universities, sped up the introduction of qualifications, and pointed out ideological rationale at the time that attorneys must attend English law inns before being able to practice on the Irish Bar. In 1846, the House of Commons select committee on legal education, chaired by Wyse, produced a report on legal education, influencing the future of both English and Irish legal education. However, this law school entered troubled times and collapsed in 1845, leading to Kennedy shortly after ending his legal career and becoming a land agent on the 13,500-tenant Bath estates in County Monaghan, where he \\"sternly refused to adopt any of the cruel remedies applied in other quarters\\" during the Great Famine, and allowed tenants to run great arrears. Fewer than one in four tenants were able to read and write, leading Kennedy to establish seven new national schools. This work, and his initiation of the Carrickmacross lace industry, is largely credited to his later election to Parliament. ==Political career== He was elected MP for County Louth as a Whig candidate in 1852 before joining the Independent Irish Party just after the election. Whilst in Parliament, he contributed primarily to debates on landlord and tenant matters, or national and industrial education. Standing in this capacity in 1857, he lost the seat. At the 1859 general election, he stood as a Liberal for King's County, but ended at the bottom of the poll. He was re-elected as a Liberal candidate at a by-election in 1865 and held the seat until he stood down in 1868, after a sectarian campaign waged by Matthew Dease, the successful Liberal candidate. In 1874, Kennedy stood for election in Donegal, but was unsuccessful. ==Later life== Kennedy was also a member of the Dublin Social and Statistical Inquiry Society, visiting Belgium to inspect responses to poverty in that country and then, in 1855 with W. K. Sullivan, publishing a booklet on industrial training. He later, in 1877 and 1878, published two tracts on the reform of law and legal education. Kennedy died in 1885 at his home, Charleville, The Shrubbery, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset and was buried at Cossington village church. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1805 births Category:1885 deaths Category:Irish Liberal Party MPs Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Louth constituencies (1801–1922) Category:UK MPs 1852–1857 Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:UK MPs 1865–1868 ","title":"Tristram Kennedy"},{"id":"56714113","text":"Meloria north end Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located in the Ligurian Sea, north of Meloria south end Lighthouse and north west of Livorno, in the northern part of the Meloria shoal. ==Description== The lighthouse is a cylindrical tower built on the north extremity of Meloria shoal in 1958 in white concrete; it is high with lantern and balcony.

Compared to other members of the Salvelinus genus, it has a deeper body that is more laterally compressed, a shorter caudal peduncle and larger scales. It can be distinguished from other char by the whitish spots on upper flank and caudal and dorsal fins. ==Biology== Salvelinus grayi is benthopelagic, living at 10–30 m (30–100 ft), except during the spawning season. It feeds on water fleas (crustaceans of the order Cladocera). It spawns in November, in shallow rocky areas. ==Conservation== Recorded numbers in Lough Melvin declined from 33 in 1975 and 42 in 1986, to only 12 in 2001, and the species is considered critically endangered. Common rudd introduction and eutrophication are blamed for the decline. In 2003, a plan to relocate some of the fish to a nearby reservoir failed when no fish could be found despite extensive search. Nor was the fish observed to be spawning in its traditional spawning locations. The lake has experienced increasing levels of phosphorus as a result of agricultural activities in its catchment area, and char are notoriously sensitive to phosphorus. Another factor in the fish's decline may be the introduction into the lake of rudd and roach. == References == grayi Category:Endemic freshwater fish of Ireland Salvelinus grayi Category:Critically endangered biota of Europe ","title":"Salvelinus grayi"},{"id":"56714194","text":"\\"Freshwater herring\\" is a term applied to a wide variety of freshwater fish which resemble herring: *Clupeoides papuensis, toothed river herring *Coregonus albula, vendace *Potamalosa richmondia, Australian freshwater herring *Salvelinus grayi, the Lough Melvin charr *Sardinella tawilis, the bombon sardine ","title":"Freshwater herring"},{"id":"56714231","text":"The 1980–81 season was the 35th season in FK Partizan's existence.

In 1887, four years previously, Heinrich Hertz had discovered Hertzian waves (radio waves), electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies. This attracted much attention, and a number of researchers began experimenting with high frequency currents. Tesla's background was in the new field of alternating current power systems, so he understood transformers and resonance. In 1888 he decided that high frequencies were the most promising field for research, and set up a laboratory at 33 South Fifth Avenue, New York for researching them, initially repeating Hertz's experiments. He first developed alternators as sources of high frequency current, but by 1890 found they were limited to frequencies of about 20 kHz. In search of higher frequencies he turned to spark-excited resonant circuits. Tesla's innovation was in applying resonance to transformers.\\"Tesla is entitled to either distinct priority or independent discovery of\\" three concepts in wireless theory: \\"(1) the idea of inductive coupling between the driving and the working circuits (2) the importance of tuning both circuits, i.e. the idea of an 'oscillation transformer' (3) the idea of a capacitance loaded open secondary circuit\\" Transformers functioned differently at high frequencies than at the low frequencies used in power systems; the iron core in low frequency transformers caused energy losses due to eddy currents and hysteresis. Tesla p. 196-197 and fig. 2: Tesla describes the steps in his invention of the high frequency transformer. and Elihu Thomson independently developed a new type of transformer without an iron core, the \\"oscillation transformer\\", and the Tesla coil circuit to drive it to produce high voltages. Tesla invented the Tesla coil during efforts to develop a \\"wireless\\" lighting system, with gas discharge light bulbs that would glow in an oscillating electric field from a high voltage, high frequency power source. For a high frequency source Tesla powered a Ruhmkorff coil (induction coil) with his high frequency alternator. He found that the core losses due to the high frequency current overheated the iron core in the Ruhmkorff coil and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings. To fix this problem Tesla changed the design so that there was an air gap instead of insulating material between the windings, and made the iron core adjustable so it could be moved in or out of the coilW. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 122 He eventually found the highest voltages could be produced when the iron core was omitted. Tesla also found he needed to put the capacitor normally used in the Ruhmkorff circuit between his alternator and the coil's primary winding to avoid burning out the coil. By adjusting the coil and capacitor Tesla found he could take advantage of the resonance set up between the two to achieve even higher frequencies.W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 124 He found that the highest voltages were generated when the \\"closed\\" primary circuit with the capacitor was in resonance with the \\"open\\" secondary winding.

The round \\"spiderweb\\" secondary coil is visible in background File:Tesla electrical oscillator.gifCompact coil designed by Tesla for use as an ozone generator for water treatment Tesla was not the first to invent this circuit. Henry Rowland built a spark-excited resonant transformer circuit (above) in 1889 and Elihu Thomson had experimented with similar circuits in 1890, including one which could produce 64 inch (1.6 m) sparks, In this letter Thomson lists papers he published in technical journals which support his claim to priority in inventing the \\"Tesla coil\\" resonant transformer circuit and other sources confirm Tesla was not the first. However he was the first to see practical applications for it and patent it. Tesla did not perform detailed mathematical analyses of the circuit, relying instead on trial and error and his intuitive understanding of resonance. He even realized that the secondary coil functioned as a quarter-wave resonator; he specified the length of the wire in the secondary coil must be a quarter wavelength at the resonant frequency.\\"The length of the...coil in each transformer should be approximately one quarter of the wave length of the electric disturbance in the circuit, this estimate being based on the velocity of propagation of the disturbaiice through the coil itself...\\" US Patent No. 645576, Nikola Tesla, System of transmission of electrical energy, filed September 2, 1897; granted March 20, 1900 The first mathematical analyses of the circuit were done by Anton Oberbeck (1895) and Paul Drude (1904)., English translation ==Tesla's demonstrations== Columbia College.A description of a similar demonstration which Tesla organized at the Westinghouse exhibit at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in St. Louis is found in The two metal sheets are connected to a Tesla coil oscillator, which applies a high radio frequency oscillating voltage. The oscillating electric field between the sheets ionizes the low pressure gas in the two long Geissler tubes he is holding, causing them to glow by fluorescence, similar to neon lights, without wires. A charismatic showman and self-promoter, in 1891-1893 Tesla used the Tesla coil in dramatic public lectures demonstrating the new science of high voltage, high frequency electricity. The radio frequency AC electric currents produced by a Tesla coil did not behave like the DC or low frequency AC current scientists of the time were familiar with. In lectures at Columbia College May 20, 1891, scientific societies in Britain and France during an 1892 European speaking tour,Thomas Cummerford Martin 1894 The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla, 2nd Ed., p. 198-293 the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia in February 1893, and the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis in March 1893,\\"On light and other high frequency phenomena\\", Thomas Cummerford Martin 1894 The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla, 2nd Ed., p. 294-373 he impressed audiences with spectacular brush discharges and streamers, heated iron by induction heating, showed RF current could pass through insulators and be conducted by a single wire without a return path, and powered light bulbs and motors without wires. He demonstrated that high frequency currents often did not cause the sensation of electric shock, applying hundreds of thousands of volts to his own body, causing his body to light up with a glowing corona discharge in the darkened room. These lectures introduced the \\"Tesla oscillator\\" to the scientific community, and made Tesla internationally famous. ==Wireless power experiments== Tesla employed the Tesla coil in his efforts to achieve wireless power transmission, his lifelong dream. In the period 1891 to 1900 he used it to perform some of the first experiments in wireless power, transmitting radio frequency power across short distances by inductive coupling between coils of wire.Tesla, Nikola (May 20, 1891) Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination, lecture before the American Inst. of Electrical Engineers, Columbia College, New York. Reprinted as a In his early 1890s demonstrations such as those before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago he lit light bulbs from across a room. He found he could increase the distance by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the Tesla coil's LC circuit, transferring energy by resonant inductive coupling. At his Colorado Springs laboratory during 1899–1900, by using voltages of the order of 10 million volts generated by his enormous magnifying transmitter coil (described below), he was able to light three incandescent lamps at a distance of about .The longest Tesla wireless power transmission for which there is credible evidence is probably his 1899 picture of a receiving coil with a 10 watt light bulb lit by power transmitted from his 300,000 watt magnifying transmitter. Tesla did not give the distance, but Marincic has claimed Tesla's lab notes indicate it was at a distance of 1,938 feet (591 m) from the transmitter. This represents a transmission efficiency of only 0.0033%.Tesla was notoriously secretive about the distance he could transmit power. One of his few disclosures of details was in the caption of fig. 7 of his noted magazine article: The Problem of Increasing Human Energy, Century magazine, June 1900. The caption reads: \\"EXPERIMENT TO ILLUSTRATE AN INDUCTIVE EFFECT OF AN ELECTRICAL OSCILLATOR OF GREAT POWER - The photograph shows three ordinary incandescent lamps lighted to full candle-power by currents induced in a local loop consisting of a single wire forming a square of fifty feet each side, which includes the lamps, and which is at a distance of one hundred feet from the primary circuit energized by the oscillator. The loop likewise includes an electrical condenser, and is exactly attuned to the vibrations of the oscillator, which is worked at less than five percent of its total capacity.\\" Today the resonant inductive coupling discovered by Tesla is a familiar concept in electronics, widely used in IF transformers and short range wireless power transmission systems such as cellphone charging pads. It is now understood that inductive and capacitive coupling are \\"near-field\\" effects, so they cannot be used for long-distance transmission. However, Tesla was convinced he could develop a long range wireless power transmission system which could transmit power from power plants directly into homes and factories without wires, described in a visionary June 1900 article in Century Magazine; \\"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\\". He claimed to be able to transmit power on a worldwide scale, using a method that involved conduction through the Earth and atmosphere.US Patent No. 645576, Nikola Tesla, System of transmission of electrical energy, filed September 2, 1897; granted March 20, 1900, reprinted in Scientific American Supplement, Munn and Co., Vol. 57, No. 1483, June 4, 1904, p. 23760-23761Carlson 2013 Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, p. 209-210 Tesla believed that the entire Earth could act as an electrical resonator, and that by driving current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil with an elevated capacitance, the potential of the Earth could be made to oscillate, creating global standing waves, and this alternating current could be received with a capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth., reprinted in Another of his ideas was that transmitting and receiving terminals could be suspended in the air by balloons at altitude, where the air pressure is lower. At this altitude, he thought, a layer of electrically conductive rarefied air would allow electricity to be sent at high voltages (hundreds of millions of volts) over long distances. Tesla envisioned building a global network of wireless power stations, which he called his \\"World Wireless System\\", which would transmit both information and electric power to everyone on Earth.Carlson 2013 Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, p. 337-346 There is no reliable evidence that he ever transmitted significant amounts of power beyond the short range demonstrations above. ==Magnifying transmitter== Circuit of magnifying transmitter at Tesla's Colorado Springs laboratory.Denicolai, 2001, Tesla Transformer for Experimentation and Research, Ch.2, p. 8-10Sarkar et al. (2006) History of Wireless, p. 279-280, archive C2 represents the parasitic capacitance between the windings of coil L3. Tesla's wireless research required increasingly high voltages, and he had reached the limit of the voltages he could generate within the space of his New York lab. Between 1899 and 1900 he built a laboratory in Colorado Springs and performed experiments on wireless transmission there. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it. _Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power_ , Leland I. Anderson, 21st Century Books, 2002, p. 109, . The Colorado Springs laboratory had one of the largest Tesla coils ever built, which Tesla called a \\"magnifying transmitter\\" as it was intended to transmit power to a distant receiver., reprinted in Nikola Tesla, My Inventions, The Philovox, 1919, Ch. 5 republished as With an input power of 300 kilowatts it could produce potentials of the order of 10 million volts,Cheney, Margaret (2011) Tesla: Man Out of Time, p. 187–189 at frequencies of 50–150 kHz, creating huge \\"lightning bolts\\" reportedly up to 135 feet long. During experiments, it caused an overload which destroyed the alternator of the Colorado Springs power company, and Tesla had to rebuild the alternator. In the magnifying transmitter, Tesla used a modified design (see circuit) which he had developed in his New York lab in the period 1895–1898, _My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla_ , Hart Brothers, 1982, Ch. 5, and patented in 1902,US Patent No. 1119732, Nikola Tesla Apparatus for transmitting electrical energy, filed January 18, 1902; granted December 1, 1914Gerekos, 2012, The Tesla Coil, p. 19-20 different from his previous double-tuned circuits. In addition to the primary (L1) and secondary (L2) coils, it had a third coil (L3) which he called the \\"extra\\" coil, not magnetically coupled to the others, attached to the top terminal of the secondary. When driven by the secondary it produced additional high voltage by resonance, being adjusted to resonate with its own parasitic capacitance (C2) The use of a series-fed resonator coil to generate high voltages was independently discovered by Paul Marie Oudin in 1893 and employed in his Oudin coil. The Colorado Springs apparatus consisted of a 51-foot-diameter (15.5 m) Tesla transformer composed of a secondary winding (L2) of 50 turns of heavy wire wound on a 6-foot-high (2 m) circular wooden \\"fence\\" around the periphery of the lab, and a single-turn primary (L1) either mounted on the fence or buried in the ground under it.Carlson 2013 Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, p. 267–268 The primary was connected to a bank of oil capacitors (C1) to make a tuned circuit, with a rotary spark gap (SG), powered by 20 to 40 kilovolts from a powerful utility step-up transformer (T). The top of the secondary was connected to the 100-turn 8 ft (2.4 m) diameter \\"extra\\" or \\"resonator\\" coil (L3) in the center of the room. Its high-voltage end was connected to a telescoping 143-foot (43.6 m) \\"antenna\\" rod with a 30-inch (1 m) metal ball on top which could project through the roof of the lab. By cranking the rod up or down he could adjust the capacitance in the circuit of the extra coil, tuning it to resonance with the rest of the circuit.Carlson 2013 Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, p. 297–299 ==Wardenclyffe tower== In 1901, convinced his wireless theories were correct, Tesla with financing from banker J.

Morgan began construction of a high-voltage wireless station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York., archive Although it was built as a transatlantic radiotelegraphy station, Tesla also intended it to transmit electric power without wires as a prototype transmitter for his proposed \\"World Wireless System\\". Essentially an enormous Tesla coil, it consisted of a powerhouse with a 400-horsepower generator and a 187-foot (57 m) tower topped by a 68-foot (21 m) diameter metal dome capacitive electrode.Carlson 2013 Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, p. 318-327 The circuit he used was a version of the \\"magnifying transmitter\\" he built at Colorado Springs (above). Underneath the surface was an elaborate ground system that Tesla said was needed to \\"grip the earth\\" to create the oscillating earth currents which he believed would transmit the power. By 1904 his investors had pulled out and the facility was never completed; it was torn down in 1916. Although Tesla seems to have believed his wireless power ideas were proven, he had a history of making claims that he had not confirmed by experiment, and there seems to be no evidence that he ever transmitted significant power beyond the short-range demonstrations mentioned above. The few reports of long-distance power transmission by Tesla are not from reliable sources. For example, a widely repeated myth is that in 1899 he wirelessly lit 200 light bulbs at a distance of . There is no independent confirmation of this supposed demonstration; Tesla did not mention it, and it does not appear in his laboratory notes. It originated in 1944 from Tesla's first biographer, John J. O'Neill, who said he pieced it together from \\"fragmentary material... in a number of publications\\". In the 100 years since, others such as Robert Golka have built equipment similar to Tesla's, but long-distance power transmission has not been demonstrated,For example, using Tesla coils Leyh and Kennan only achieved 1.5% power throughput at a distance of 30 meters, only 5 times the transmitter diameter. and the scientific consensus is his World Wireless system would not have worked. Contemporary scientists point out that while Tesla's coils (with appropriate antennas) can function as radio transmitters, transmitting energy in the form of radio waves, the frequency he used, around 150 kHz, is far too low for practical long-range power transmission. At these wavelengths the radio waves spread out in all directions and cannot be focused on a distant receiver. Tesla's world power transmission scheme remains today what it was in Tesla's time: a bold, fascinating dream. ==Use in radio== :\\"[The Tesla coil] was invented not for wireless but for making vacuum lamps glow without external electrodes, and it later played a principal part in other hands in the operation of big spark stations.\\" --William H. Eccles, 1933 quoted in Sarkar, Mailloux, Oliner (2006) History of Wireless, p. 268. Eccles was a contemporary of Tesla. One of the largest applications of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils.Sarkar et al (2006) History of Wireless, p. 352-353, 355-357, archive Aitken, Hugh 2014 Syntony and Spark: The origins of radio, p. 70–73 Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating in the same area their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another. In 1892 William Crookes, a friend of Tesla, had given a lecture on the uses of radio waves in which he suggested using resonance to reduce the bandwidth in transmitters and receivers. By using resonant circuits, different transmitters could be \\"tuned\\" to transmit on different frequencies. With narrower bandwidth, separate transmitter frequencies would no longer overlap, so a receiver could receive a particular transmission by \\"tuning\\" its resonant circuit to the same frequency as the transmitter. This is the system used in all modern radio. With an appropriate wire antenna, the Tesla coil circuit could function as such a narrow-bandwidth radio transmitter. In his March 1893 St. Louis lecture, Tesla demonstrated a wireless system that was the first use of tuned circuits in radio, although he used it for wireless power transmission, not radio communication.Aitken, Hugh 2014 Syntony and Spark: The origins of radio, p. 254-255, 259 A grounded spark-excited capacitor-tuned Tesla transformer attached to an elevated wire antenna transmitted radio waves, which were received across the room by a wire antenna attached to a receiver consisting of a second grounded resonant transformer tuned to the transmitter's frequency, which lighted a Geissler tube.Cheney, Margaret (2011) Tesla: Man Out Of Time, p. 96–97 This system, patented by Tesla on September 2, 1897, was the first use of the \\"four- circuit\\" concept later claimed by Guglielmo Marconi.The \\"four circuit\\" radio system, which Marconi claimed in his 1900 patent, meant a transmitter and receiver which each contained a resonant transformer and thus were divided into primary and secondary circuits. All four circuits were tuned to the same frequency, one side by capacitors, and the other side by the capacitance of the antenna; \\"the use of two high frequency circuits in the transmitter and two in the receiver, all four so adjusted to be resonant at the same frequency or multiples of it.\\" This was identical to the system Tesla demonstrated in 1893. The advantage of this system was that due to the resonant transformers both the receiver and transmitter had much narrower bandwidth than previous circuits. However, Tesla was mainly interested in wireless power and never developed a practical radio communication system. He never believed that radio waves could be used for practical communication, instead clinging to an erroneous theory that radio communication was due to currents in the Earth. archived on tfcbooks Practical radiotelegraphy communication systems were developed by Marconi beginning in 1895. By 1897 the advantages of narrow- bandwidth (lightly damped) systems noted by Crookes were recognized, and resonant circuits, capacitors and inductors, were incorporated in transmitters and receivers. The \\"closed primary, open secondary\\" resonant transformer circuit used by Tesla proved a superior transmitter, because the loosely- coupled transformer partially isolated the oscillating primary circuit from the energy-radiating antenna circuit, reducing the damping, allowing it to produce long \\"ringing\\" waves which had a narrower bandwidth.Marconi describes his discovery of this principle, and admits his circuit used the \\"Tesla coil\\", in Versions of the circuit were patented by Marconi, John Stone StoneUS Patent no. 714,756, John Stone Stone Method of electric signaling, filed: February 8, 1900, granted: December 2, 1902 and Oliver Lodge,US Patent no. 609,154 Oliver Joseph Lodge, Electric Telegraphy, filed: February 1, 1898, granted: August 16, 1898 and were widely used in radio for twenty years. In 1906 Max Wien invented the quenched or \\"series\\" spark gap, which extinguished the spark after the energy had been transferred to the secondary, allowing the secondary to oscillate freely after that, reducing damping and bandwidth still more. Although their damping had been reduced as much as possible, spark transmitters still produced damped waves which had a wide bandwidth, creating interference with other transmitters. Around 1920 they became obsolete, superseded by vacuum tube transmitters which generated continuous waves at a single frequency, which could also be modulated to carry sound. Tesla's resonant transformer continued to be used in vacuum tube transmitters and receivers, and is a key component in radio to this day.\\"Unfortunately, the common misunderstanding by most people today is that the Tesla coil is merely a device that produces a spectacular exhibit of sparks which tittilates audiences. Nevertheless, its circuitry is fundamental to all radio transmission\\" During the \\"spark era\\" the radio engineering profession gave credit to Tesla; his circuit became known as the \\"Tesla coil\\" or \\"Tesla transformer\\". However Tesla did not benefit financially, due to competing patent claims. Marconi had claimed rights to the \\"closed primary open secondary\\" transmitter circuit in his controversial 1900 \\"four circuit\\" wireless patent.US Patent no. 763,772, Guglielmo Marconi, Apparatus for wireless telegraphy, filed: November 10, 1900, granted: June 28, 1904. Corresponding British patent no. 7777, Guglielmo Marconi, Improvements in apparatus for wireless telegraphy, filed: April 26, 1900, granted: April 13, 1901 Tesla sued Marconi in 1915 for patent infringement, but didn't have the resources to pursue the action. However, in 1943, in a separate suit brought by the Marconi Company against the US government for use of its patents in World War I, the US Supreme Court invalidated Marconi's 1900 patent claim to the \\"four circuit\\" concept., archive The ruling cited the prior patents of Tesla, Lodge, and Stone, but did not decide which of these parties had rights to the circuit. By that time the issue was moot; the patent had expired in 1915 and spark transmitters had long been obsolete. Although there is some disagreement over the role Tesla himself played in the invention of radio, sources agree on the importance of his circuit in early radio transmitters.Gerekos, 2012, The Tesla Coil, p. 1 From a modern perspective, most spark transmitters could be regarded as Tesla coils. ==Use in medicine== The three circuits used in electrotherapy apparatus in the early 20th century: (1) Tesla coil, (2) D'Arsonval coil, (3) Oudin coil. In medical coils for safety two capacitors (Leyden jars) were used, one in each branch of the primary circuit, to completely isolate the patient's body from the potentially lethal currents of the supply transformer, in case of an electrical fault. Tesla had observed as early as 1891 that high frequency currents above 10 kHz did not cause the sensation of electric shock, and in fact currents that would be lethal at lower frequencies could be passed through the body without apparent harm. Also read at the 8th annual meeting of The American Electro- Therapeutic Association, Buffalo, New York, Sept. 13-15, 1898 He experimented on himself, and claimed daily applications of high voltage relieved depression.Carlson 2013 Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, p. 217 He was one of the first to observe the heating effect of high frequency currents on the body, the basis of diathermy.Cheney (2011) Tesla:Man Out of Time, p. 103 During his highly publicized early 1890s demonstrations he passed hundreds of thousands of volts through his body. With characteristic hyperbole he called electricity \\"the greatest of all doctors\\" and suggested burying wires under classrooms so its stimulating effect would improve performance of \\"dull\\" schoolchildren. Tesla wrote two pioneering papers, in 1891Tesla, N. \\"High frequency currents for medical purposes\\" in Electrical Engineer, 1891, cited in Saberton, Claude (1920) Diathermy in Medical and Surgical Practice, published by Paul B. Hoeber, New York, p. 131 and 1898 on the medical uses of high frequency currents, but did little further work on the subject. A few other researchers were also experimentally applying high frequency currents to the body at this time. Elihu Thomson, the co-inventor of the Tesla coil, was one, so in medicine the Tesla coil became known as the \\"Tesla-Thomson apparatus\\". In France, from 1889 physician and pioneering biophysicist Jacques d'Arsonval had been documenting the physiological effects of high frequency current on the body, and had made the same discoveries as Tesla., translated by J. H. Kellogg During his 1892 European trip Tesla met with D'Arsonval and was flattered to find they were using similar circuits. D'Arsonval's spark- excited resonant circuits (above) did not produce as high voltage as the Tesla transformer. In 1893 French physician Paul Marie Oudin added a \\"resonator\\" coil to the D'Arsonval circuit to create the high voltage Oudin coil,, p.189 fig. 98 a circuit very similar to the Tesla coil, which was widely used for treating patients in Europe. During this period, people were fascinated by the new technology of electricity, and many believed it had miraculous curative or \\"vitalizing\\" powers.Strong, Frederick Finch (1908) High-Frequency Currents, p. 220-223 Medical ethics were also looser, and doctors could experiment on their patients. By the turn of the century, application of high voltage, \\"high frequency\\" currents to the body had become part of a Victorian era medical field, part legitimate experimental medicine and part quack medicine, called electrotherapy. Manufacturers produced medical apparatus to generate \\"Tesla currents\\", \\"D'Arsonval currents\\", and \\"Oudin currents\\" for physicians. In electrotherapy, a pointed electrode attached to the high voltage terminal of the coil was held near the patient, and the luminous brush discharges from it (called \\"effluves\\") were applied to parts of the body to treat a wide variety of medical conditions. In order to apply the electrode directly to the skin, or tissues inside the mouth, anus or vagina, a \\"vacuum electrode\\" was used, consisting of a metal electrode sealed inside a partially evacuated glass tube, which produced a dramatic violet glow. The glass wall of the tube and the skin surface formed a capacitor which limited the current to the patient, preventing discomfort. These vacuum electrodes were later manufactured with handheld Tesla coils to make \\"violet ray\\" wands, sold to the public as a quack home medical device.The small high voltage coils in these home violet ray wands resembled induction coils more than Tesla coils; they had iron core transformers and mechanical interrupters and produced lower voltages, 30 - 80 kV, than Tesla coils The popularity of electrotherapy peaked after World War 1, but by the 1920s authorities began to crack down on fraudulent medical treatments, and electrotherapy largely became obsolete. A part of the field that survived was diathermy, the application of high frequency current to heat body tissue, pioneered by German physician Karl Nagelschmidt in 1907. During the 1920s \\"long wave\\" (0.5~2 MHz) Tesla coil spark diathermy machines were used, in which the current was applied to the body by electrodes. By the 1930s these were being replaced by \\"short wave\\" (10~100 MHz) vacuum tube diathermy machines, which had less danger of causing burns, but Tesla coils continued to be used in both diathermy and quack medical devices like violet ray until World War 2. In 1926 William T. Bovie discovered that RF currents applied to a scalpel could cut and cauterize tissue in medical operations, and spark oscillators were used as electrosurgery generators or \\"Bovies\\" as late as the 1980s. During the 1920s and 30s all unipolar (single terminal) high voltage medical coils came to be called Oudin coils, so today's unipolar Tesla coils are sometimes referred to as \\"Oudin coils\\". ==Use in show business== The Tesla coil's spectacular displays of sparks, and the fact that its currents could pass through the human body without causing electric shock, led to its use in the entertainment business. In the early 20th century it appeared in traveling carnivals, freak shows and circus and carnival sideshows, which often had an act in which a performer would pass high voltages through his body Performers such as \\"Dr. Resisto\\", \\"The Human Dynamo\\", \\"Electrice\\", \\"The Great Volta\\", and \\"Madamoiselle Electra\\" would have their body connected to the high voltage terminal of a hidden Tesla coil, causing sparks to shoot from their fingertips and other parts of their body, and neon lights and fluorescent tube lamps to light up when brought near them.Many of these stunts are demonstrated and explained in A lyrical description of such a performer appears in science fiction writer Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel . Bradbury has said that this was based on a real performer, Mr. Electrico, part of a seedy traveling carnival, whom he met as a boy in 1932 in Waukegan, Illinois. Bradbury, Ray (December 2001) In his words blog, Ray Bradbury personal website and Weller, Sam (Spring 2010) \\"Ray Bradbury interview, The Art of Fiction No. 203\\", The Paris Review, No. 192, published by Antonio Weiss, New York. They could also light candles or cigarettes with their fingers. Although they didn't usually cause electric shocks, RF arc discharges from the bare skin could cause painful burns; to prevent them performers sometimes wore metal thimbles on their fingertips (Rev. Moon, center image above, is using them). These acts were extremely dangerous and could kill the performer if the Tesla coil was misadjusted. In carny lingo this was called an \\"electric chair act\\" because it often included a spark-laced \\"electrocution\\" of the performer in an electric chair, exploiting public fascination with this exotic new method of capital punishment, which had become the United States' dominant method of execution around 1900. Today entertainers still perform high voltage acts with Tesla coils,Danielle Stamp AKA 'Miss Electra' but modern bioelectromagnetics has brought a new awareness of the hazards of Tesla coil currents, and allowing them to pass through the body is today considered extremely dangerous. Tesla coils were also used as dramatic props in early mystery and science fiction motion pictures, starting in the silent era. The crackling, writhing sparks emanating from the electrode of a giant Tesla coil became Hollywood's iconic symbol of the \\"mad scientist's\\" lab, recognized throughout the world. This was probably because the eccentric Nikola Tesla himself, with his famous high voltage demonstrations and his mysterious Colorado Springs laboratory, was one of the main prototypes from which the \\"mad scientist\\" stock character originated. Some early films in which Tesla coils appeared were Wolves of Kultur (1918), The Power God (1926), Metropolis (1927), Frankenstein (1931) and its many sequels such as Son of Frankenstein (1939), The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), Chandu the Magician (1932), The Lost City (1935), and The Clutching Hand (1936)William Luddington, \\"Mr. Electricity: The Multi-Volted Career of Kenneth Strickfaden\\" in and many later films and television shows. By the 1980s, effects like high voltage sparks were being added to movies by CGI as visual effects in post-production, eliminating the need for dangerous high voltage Tesla coils on sets. The Tesla coils for many of these movies were constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden (1896-1984) who, beginning with his spectacular effects in the 1931 Frankenstein, became Hollywood's preeminent electrical special effects expert. His large \\"Meg Senior\\" Tesla coil seen in many of these movies consisted of a 6-foot 1000 turn conical secondary and a 10 turn primary, connected to a capacitor through a rotary spark gap, powered by a 20 kV transformer. It could produce 6 foot sparks. Some of his last gigs were the reassembly of the original 1931 Frankenstein high voltage apparatus for the Mel Brooks satire Young Frankenstein (1974), and construction of a million volt Tesla coil which produced 12 foot sparks for a 1976 stage show by the rock band Kiss. == Use in education == Small educational Tesla coil kit, 1918 Ever since Tesla's 1890s lectures, Tesla coils have been used as attractions in educational exhibits and science fairs. They have become a way to counter the stereotype that science is boring. In the early 20th century, experts like Henry Transtrom and Earle Ovington gave high voltage demonstrations at \\"electric fairs\\". High school classes built Tesla coils. From 1933 into the 1980s, between movie jobs Hollywood special effects expert Ken Strickfaden would take his high voltage apparatus on the road in an exhibition called \\"Science on Parade\\" and later \\"The Kenstric Space Age Science Show\\" to high schools, colleges, World Fairs and expositions.Goldman (2005) Kenneth Strickfaden, Dr. Frankenstein's Electrician, p. 62-68 These spectacular shows, which reached 48 states, had a seminal influence on the birth of the modern \\"coiling\\" movement. A number of present-day Tesla hobbyists such as William Wysock say they were inspired to build Tesla coils by seeing Strickfaden's show. One of the oldest and best-known coils still in operation is the \\"GPO-1\\" at Griffith Park Observatory in Los Angeles. It was originally one of a pair of coils built in 1910 by Earle L. Ovington, a friend of Tesla and manufacturer of high voltage electrotherapy apparatus. For a number of years Ovington displayed them at the December electrical trade show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, using them for demonstrations of high voltage science, which Tesla himself sometimes attended. Called the Million Volt Oscillator, the twin coils were installed on the balcony at the show. Every hour the lights were dimmed and the public was treated to a display of 10 foot arcs. Ovington gave the coils to his friend Dr. Frederick Finch Strong, a leading figure in the alternative health field of electrotherapy. In 1937 Strong donated the coils to the Griffith Observatory. The museum didn't have room to display both, but one coil was restored by Kenneth Strickfaden and has been in daily operation ever since. It consists of a 48 in. (1.2 m) high conical secondary coil topped by a 12 in. (30 cm) diameter copper ball electrode, with a 9-turn spiral primary of 2 in. copper strip, a glass plate capacitor (replacing the original Leyden jars), and rotary spark gap. Its output has been estimated at 1.3 million volts. ==Later uses== Breit and Tuve's 5 MV Tesla coil used as particle accelerator, 1928 In addition to its use in spark-gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing. In 1926, pioneering accelerator physicists Merle Tuve and Gregory Breit built a 5 million volt Tesla coil as a linear particle accelerator. The bipolar coil consisted of a pyrex tube a meter long wound with 8000 turns of fine wire, with round corona caps on each end, and a 5 turn spiral primary coil surrounding it at the center. It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 megavolts. Although it was used for a short period in 1929-30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a half cycle of the RF voltage. In 1970 Robert K. Golka built a replica of Tesla's huge Colorado Springs magnifying transmitter in a shed at Wendover Air Force Base, Utah, using data he found in Tesla's lab notes archived at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Beograd, Serbia. This was one of the first experiments with the magnifier circuit since Tesla's time. The coil generated 12 million volts. Golka used it to try to duplicate Tesla's reported synthesis of ball lightning. ==References== Category:Nikola Tesla Category:History of electrical engineering ","title":"History of the Tesla coil"},{"id":"56714277","text":"Christine Linda Shawcroft (born April 1955) is a British Labour Party activist and former politician. Shawcroft is a director of Momentum and was elected as the chair of the Labour Party's Disputes Sub-Committee in January 2018. In March 2018, she resigned from her post after she disputed the suspension of a Labour candidate who was accused of Holocaust denial. She later resigned her position on Labour's National Executive Committee. ==Early career== Shawcroft has worked for many years as a teacher in the East End of London. She was elected as a Labour Party member of Tower Hamlets London Borough Council in a 1985 by-election, representing Blackwall, and served for two years as leader of the Labour group on the council, while it was in opposition. She served on the executive of the London Labour Party. From the mid-1990s, prospective Labour council candidates had to be vetted by a selection panel, and Shawcroft was refused permission to defend her council seat in 1998, Liz Davies claiming that this was due to Shawcroft's left-wing views. She was also rejected as a potential candidate for the London Assembly. ==Member of the NEC== In 1998, Shawcroft stood for the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) as part of the Grassroots Alliance slate. The slate took four out of six seats in the constituency section, but Shawcroft was not elected. The following year, she took second place in the vote and finally gained a place on the NEC. She retained her seat at each subsequent election. At the 2001 United Kingdom general election, Shawcroft stood in Meriden, taking second place with 39.2% of the vote. Shawcroft was a leading member of the Labour Representation Committee, a left-wing group within the Labour Party, but resigned in 2012 in protest of it taking control of the Labour Briefing journal. With other opponents of this takeover, she became a director of a new Labour Briefing publication. In 2015, Shawcroft was briefly suspended from the Labour Party after she gave support to Lutfur Rahman, the former Mayor of Tower Hamlets. A supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, and also of Jon Lansman, Shawcroft became a director of Momentum. In January 2018, she was elected as chair of the Labour Party's Disputes Sub-Committee, defeating Ann Black. During the process to choose the next general secretary of the Labour Party in March 2018, following the resignation of Iain McNicol, Shawcroft was vocal in her support for Jon Lansman of Momentum over Jennie Formby of the Unite union, a contest which was proving divisive among supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. She commented on Facebook: \\"Nothing would induce me to support a candidate from a major trade union, they stick it to the rank and file members time after time after time. It’s also time to support disaffiliation of the unions from the Labour Party. The party belongs to us, the members\\". The comments, which were soon deleted, caused consternation among trade unionists and Momentum distanced itself from Shawcroft's statement. In February 2019, she decided not to re-stand for the NEC in the election to be held that summer. At the end of March 2018, after a leak to The Times, she resigned from the Disputes Sub-Committee after casting doubt on the case for a suspension, offering \\"partisan disputes in local parties\\" as an explanation for the dispute. Alan Bull, intended to be a May 2018 council candidate in Peterborough, had in 2015 shared a (faked) article in a closed Facebook group headlined: \\"International Red Cross Report Confirms the Holocaust of Six Million Jews is a Hoax\\" accompanied by a photograph of the gates at Auschwitz, to \\"invite discussion and debate\\". \\"I'm not an anti- Semite, I am not a holocaust denier - I support equal rights for Palestinian people,\\" Bull later said. Shawcroft said she was not fully aware of the facts at the time of sending the email and, if she had been, would have reacted differently. A few days later, after seeing the \\"abhorrent image\\", she wrote on Facebook that she had told the member that he should be sent for training about antisemitism, and that the issue within the Labour Party was being used to attack Jeremy Corbyn. Bull later removed the post. On 31 March 2018, Shawcroft issued a further statement in which she indicated that, while \\"it has been a privilege to serve on the Labour party National Executive Committee for the last 19 years\\", she was resigning from the body \\"with immediate effect\\". She was replaced on the NEC by Eddie Izzard. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Councillors in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Labour Party (UK) officials ","title":"Christine Shawcroft"},{"id":"56714278","text":"East Sweden () is a NUTS 1 region in Sweden.

Houses include: * 5 Tremerton Street, Saint Augustine * 21 Water Street (1905), Saint Augustine * 48 Sevilla Street, Saint Augustine * 178 Bay Street, Saint Augustine * 287 Saint George Street, Saint Augustine * 297 Saint George Street (1914), Saint Augustine * 404 Old Quarry Road (1917), Anastasia Island Henderich also took advantage of the area's natural resources to bring the Mediterranean Revival style to Florida in civic architecture. After the original Flagler Hospital was destroyed by fire in 1916, Mary Lily Kenan (the widow of Henry Flagler) and the hospital's ladies auxiliary raised funds toward construction of a new building. The new Flagler Hospital opened in 1921, designed by Henderich with a stucco shell dash exterior and a red tile roof. In 1925, Henderich designed a masonry structure at 120 Martin Luther King Ave (then Central Avenue) which served as Saint Augustine's first public high school for African-Americans. The Colored School was renamed Excelsior in 1928 and served as Lincolnville's community center for over forty years. It was retired as a high school in 1968 and reopened as the Excelsior Museum and Cultural Center in 2005. Henderich's major Florida buildings include: * Saint Augustine Record Building (1906), 154 Cordova Street in Saint Augustine * Solla-Carcaba Cigar Factory (1909), 88 Riberia Street in Saint Augustine * Plaza Bandstand (1918), Saint Augustine * Saint Johns County Courthouse (1918), southwest corner of Charlotte and Treasury Streets in Saint Augustine * Flagler Hospital (1921), Marine Street in Saint Augustine * Florida Normal and Industrial Institute (1924), West King Street and Holmes Boulevard in Saint Augustine * Hastings High School (1924), 6195 South Main Street in Hastings * Excelsior School (1925), 120 Martin Luther King Avenue in Saint Augustine * Marineland (1937), Anastasia Island * Saint Augustine Visitor's Center ==References== Category:1879 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Columbia University alumni Category:American architects ","title":"Fred A.

She studied textiles, printing and weaving at Musashino Art University. She graduated in 1969. She was married to the late Masakazu Kobayashi, with whom she collaborated. ==Career== ===Early work=== Kobayashi started out as a weaver but became entranced by thread, by the paradox that she described as \\"so gentle\\" and \\"so strong\\".. For the next fifteen years she explored the soft yet strong paradox in wall reliefs and sculptures. This involved using her own off-loom technique where she glued strands of yarn next to each other on a board creating a ribbed texture. On top of this she placed layers of fibre in parallel to this texture, which she built up to create a three-dimensional profile. These pieces dealt with the linearity of fibre, while introducing the element of volume ===Later work=== In 1987 Kobayashi made a shift in her practice,using the same technique of building up using glue, she created a free hanging ring.. While her early work focused on solids, these later works focused on voids. While her early work stayed in her thematic red and what, the later work has shifted some, including pink, which she said was white reflecting red. The scale of many of these pieces is monumental, as she received many architectural commissions during this period ===Themes=== Formal contrasts are at the core of Kobayashi's work; the relationship of horizontal to vertical, of soft to solid straight to curved and ying to yang.. For Kobayashi, the properties of her materials convey metaphysical messages. The cosmos and nature are themes She deals with, as well as \\"singing\\" with thread ==Major Exhibitions== Fiber: Sculpture 1960 – present.Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, USA, Wexner Center for the Arts Columbus, USA, Des Moines Art Center, Iowa, USA, 2015 Tradition Transformed: Contemporary Japanese Textile Art and Fiber Sculpture: Sheila Hicks, Masakazu Kobayashi, Naomi Kobayashi, Chiaki Maki, Kaori Maki, Toshio Sekiji, Hiroyuki Shindo, Chiyoko Tanaka, Jun Tomita.

Due to varied ecology in Madagascar, many different materials were used to weave with and formed various styles of mainly striped cloth. ==Cultural impact== Textiles were an essential part Malagasy social and ethnic identity. Some types of cloth were imbued with supernatural powers. The Sakalava, Mahafaly, and Merina were three Malagasy cultures for which textiles played an important role in statecraft and metaphysical belief systems. Malagasy weaving was associated with women and the female identity. The relationships between weaving, the ancestors, and reburial are issues that reflect a dynamic world of spiritual power, social importance, and symbolism. A Madagascar-wise tale stated that the original union of a man and a woman, the wife brought the cloth and a mat, while the husband provided house building and agriculture. Hence, traditionally, a women's domestic skills, intelligence and industry were judged largely on her weaving. ==Lamba== Traditionally the primary article of clothing woven by Malagasy women was the lamba. Lamba is the term that the highlanders used, other colloquial names exist). It was created by sewing together two pieces to form a rectangle measuring around 2 m x 2.5 m. Warp created stripes adorned this cloth, with the stripes running around the waist horizontally. The Lamba was worn differently depending on the emotional and physical needs of the wearer to: protect from cold, hide timidity, show action and determination, or indicate mourning. It also served as a: blanket, apron, scarf, belt, bedding, turban, kitchen cloth, bag/ suitcase, tent/ shelter, awning, baby carrier or cradle. ==The Five Zones== The differences in weaving can largely be divided by weaving materials, which were indigenous to different areas and create five different weaving zone or areas. Only in one part of the areas, in the central highlands was frequent trading to acquire different materials common. === The East and West Coast=== Raffia was the staple fibre of these peoples of this region who in present times are made up of the: Sihanaka, Tsimihety, Antakarana, northern Sakalava, and the Betsimisaraka. Different groups made different lengths and sizes of raffia garments, all of which were good in the rain, mud and constant humidity of the area ===The Southeast=== Voara family of trees beaten bark, once used by most of the island by the 19th century was considered the specialty of the southeast, along with Harefo reeds that were plaited not woven on looms. The Tanala, Antemoro people, Antambahoaka, Tefasy, Tesaka, eastern Bara people and eastern Betsileo people are the current day residents of these lands ===The Southeast Hinterland=== The spun bark associated the southeast could be made soft and as shimmery as silk. The Hofotra (Abutilon angulatum) species, particularly the Hafo-potsy variety, was used by the Zafimaniry and the eastern Betsileo people. This material was long process that included: fire drying the inner bark, several sessions of hours boiling bark, washing, sun drying, splitting it, tying it end to end, twisting it by rolling on the thigh, weaving it on a back strap loom and beating finished product to make it softer and shinier. ===The South and West=== In the arid South and West of madagascar, cotton, the prime clothing material, and wild silk were the two main fibres. This area is the home of the Bara people, southern Sakalava people, Vezo people, Masikoro,Mahafaly, Tandroy and western Tanosy. The Malagasy define silk by the type of leaves the silk worms eat, which here was the Afiafy and pisopiso trees and well as the most coveted, the tapia, in the Isalo region of Bara's territory. ===The Central Highlands=== The historic home of the Betsileo was indigenous to three types of fibre: Hemp, Banana stem fibre and wild silk of the Tapia trees, however these fibres were of limited distribution. This area used trade to overcome their lack and emerged as one of the most important textile production centres of Madagascar. Through trade and eventually introduction to the local area, mulberry silk emerged as one of the prominent materials of this region along with non-indigenous cotton and pigeon pea silk. The Merina had no indigenous fiber in their area and its inhabitants were prone to famine, so monarchs made it a political strategy to develop trades, particularly weaving in the area. Cocoons collected from the wild silkworm were unraveled than woven into valuable textiles called lambda mena, meaning “red silk' in the Merina kingdom. The name is a misnomer, referring to their \\"red\\" status that recalled royal prestige and ancestral authority, which in the Merina associated with the color red. These cloths were woven in many different color and pattern combinations. Worn by the aristocracy in life, these \\"red\\" textiles were also a focal point of burial, exhumation, and reburial ceremonies designed to free the dead person’s spirit from earthly death and decay. ==References== Category:Malagasy culture Category:Weaving ","title":"Malagasy weaving"},{"id":"56714659","text":"Valère Thiébaud (born 26 January 1999) is a Swiss racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Continental team .

The cast was finished in 1873, but on its way to Washington, the statue was diverted to the State House in Trenton where it ended up in an obscure hallway. In 1880, the mistake was discovered and concerned citizens of Newark petitioned to relocate the sculpture to its original destination in Statuary Hall, and if not there, then to a suitable location in Newark where Kearney was born and raised. The petition was successful and in 1880, the statue was installed to Newark's Military Park on a Quincy granite base designed by Henry Kirke Brown and architect Paul G. Botticher to resemble an embankment in a war fortification.\\" In that same year the statue accepted into the Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C. The statue had somehow become two. In 1993, the Newark statue was knocked of its base and in the process of restoring it a cast was taken and another version of the work was created, this one placed in Kearny, New Jersey, a town named after the general and dedicated on September 10, 1993.

In local oral traditions they appear as \\"white giants\\" who arrived in Darfur from somewhere in the north, which might be a hint to them originally being Berbers. They are credited with the introduction of monumental stone architecture, advanced stone-working techniques and agriculture techniques like terrace farming, irrigation and palm tree cultivation. By the 12th century the Tora culture had been succeeded by the Daju. ==Architecture== While it is unknown if the Tora even existed, the pre-Daju sites ascribed to them are real. The construction methods employed appear to be a local development, different from the architecture of the Chad and Nile region, but still fundamentally African in character. Typical for Tora architecture is the massive masonry which is faced on both sides. Rubble was used to fill the walls, making the structures extremely solid. The largest type of structure are palaces, being as large as 200-400m in diameter. They normally consist of stone huts encircled by a wall and were built on hill-tops. The wall could be divided or coupled to present two separate compounds, with two entrances opposite each other. This probably served to separate males from females. The Tora architecture was adopted by the succeeding Daju kingdom and remained in use in modified form during the rule of the Tunjur and early Keira sultans, but had been replaced by new construction methods including fired bricks by 1700. ==References== ==Literature== *Andrew Mcgregor (2000): ''The Stone Monuments and Antiquities of the Jebel Marra Region, Darfur, Sudan c. 1000-1750. *Andrew Mcgregor (2011): \\"Palaces in the Mountains: An Introduction to the Archaeological Heritage of the Sultanate of Darfur\\" in \\"Sudan&Nubia; No. 15. pp. 129–141.

He studied psychology and was subsequently promoted at the University of Nijmegen. On 24 November 1982, the Association for Democracy was founded, as a direct result of the announcement of reform plans by Dési Bouterse, which he unveiled in a speech on 15 November 1982. It consisted of people who wanted to commit themselves to the return of democracy in Suriname. Trade union actions and student demonstrations were organized, and in Paramaribo there was great unrest. The strike actions were a thorn in the eyes of Bouterse and his Group of Sixteen sergeants, who assumed that the actions were deliberately organized to cause unrest. The military saw Leckie as the instigator of the student protests; therefore he was placed on a list of opponents to be killed. On 8 December 1982, on the personal order of Bouterse, Leckie was captured by the military, brought to prison in Fort Zeelandia, where he, after cruel torturing, was murdered, becoming one of the fifteen victims being killed by the military that day. On December 13, he was buried at the Roman Catholic cemetery in Paramaribo, next to co-victim Jozef Slagveer. According to eyewitness accounts, he had bruises in his face and a bullet hole in his chest. When the graves of the victims were opened for forensic investigation in 2002, the grave of Leckie was opened first. == References == *De Jong, T., I.M. Ahammer, C.F.M. Van Lieshout en G.

Desan is an American academic. She is the Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at the Harvard Law School and, with Sven Beckert, co-director of the Program on the Study of Capitalism at Harvard University. Christine Desan founded and is the managing director of a website, JustMoney.Org, that analyzes money as a legal institution. She serves on the advisory boards for Capitalism and History and The Journal of Law and Political Economy. In 2019, Desan delivered the Adam Smith Lecture on Jurisprudence at the University of Glasgow. ==Education== Desan graduated in 1981 from Princeton University majoring in Religion. She earned her Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy in 1987 from Yale Law School and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. After graduation, she worked in the U.S. Office of the Solicitor General. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. ==Field of interest== Desan's work focuses on monetary history and theory. She argued in her 2014 book, Making Money: Coin, Currency, and the Coming of Capitalism (Oxford 2014), that a profound change in money's design occurred when the British government began to share money-making authority with investors incorporated as a national bank (the Bank of England). That monetary transformation would soon expand to include a powerful financial architecture. Over the decades of the 18th century, the British developed circulating public debt, capital markets, and commercial banking. Those institutions worked synergistically with the Bank of England as it grew into a central bank. Desan identifies that quartet of institutions as central to and characteristic of the modern capitalism that went viral across the globe. According to Desan, the revolution in monetary design included conceptual or ideological shifts that have come to be identified with classical and modern liberalism. A prime example of such change is the revision of older attitudes towards self- interest and usury. By contrast to medieval approaches, the British government institutionalized an orientation towards material self-interest as a legitimate incentive for a public-regarding activity when it incorporated the Bank of England. While the medieval world rejected the motive to profit from making money, the British ordained it patriotic. Likewise, their government encouraged people to lend to the government through public bonds that returned interest to those holding them. Desan is known for pioneering a \\"constitutional approach\\" to money and finance. According to that approach, money and finance are fields of public activity or forms of governance. Observing that modern moneys are anchored at the center by sovereign authority, Desan argues that they are basically public projects: creating a medium allows a government to measure resources and mobilize them. More particularly, Desan observes that political authorities have unique capacity to create a unit of account that will be widely accepted. As \\"stakeholder\\" within a community supported by member resources, a government can pay a member in a credit unit for advance contributions. That unit will hold value insofar as the government agrees to accept the credit unit back in lieu of future contributions. When a unit holds predictable value, demand among individuals to use it in private exchange also increases, accounting for the premium that money offers in cash services. The public definition of money makes it the original \\"safe asset.\\" According to Desan, government authority characterizes modern payments systems even if a government delegates enormous authority to private entities, like the commercial banks that today multiply the monetary base. Desan identifies private banking activity as a design choice within the financial architecture, analogous to minting on demand in commodity money worlds. A medium that measures value and provides a mode of payment is useful to private as well as public actors. By delegating money creation to commercial banks, a government can ensure elasticity in the money supply. The constitutional approach contrasts with many conventions about money, which assume that it arose from barter or private exchange among individuals. Desan's recent work argues that such theories cannot explain how decentralized agents have a commensurable unit in which to work. More generally, Desan critiques neoclassical economics on the ground that it naturalizes existing arrangements and reifies \\"the market\\" as a sphere with a self-evident structure. Her work contends that design features associated with modern monetary systems are distributively non-neutral, contributing to escalating inequality. Desan's earlier work focused on the monetary practice in early America. Before she began working on money, Desan analyzed legislative practices in early America. She coined the term \\"legislative adjudication\\" to refer to the authority that legislatures asserted to respond to claims for money from the public fisc. Those claims were generally made by petition given the sovereign immunity that protected legislatures from suit. ==Activism== While in Brookline, Massachusetts, Desan served for 10 years on a town committee that researched and drafted legislation promoting campaign finance reform and supervised that reform once it was enacted. With Elizabeth Bartholet and James Cavallaro, Desan co-authored and organized an Open Letter to the U.S. Congress Concerning Human Rights Abuses at Abu Ghraib (presented June 16, 2004), signed by 509 law professors. Desan co-signed the 2014 public statement by members of the faculty of Harvard Law School that objected to the \\"Sexual Harassment Policy and Procedures\\" imposed by the central university administration as insufficient to project the values associated with due process. Desan was also a co-signatory to the open letter addressed, on 4 October 2018, to the U.S. Senate that argued against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2017, Desan authored a letter signed by 81 Harvard Law School colleagues condemning President Trump rhetoric that incited violence. Desan supports an initiative to establish a public bank in Massachusetts and serves on the Steering Committee of the Massachusetts Public Banking Group. ==Works== * * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Harvard Law School faculty Category:American women academics Category:Women legal scholars Category:History of currency Category:History of money Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Christine A.

One of the seven founders of La Leche League in 1956, she established the Colorado branch of the advocacy group and drafted state laws on behalf of women who breastfeed their infants in public and in the workplace. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012. ==Early life, education, and marriage== Mary Ann Collins was born in Wisconsin in 1931 and moved to the Chicago area as a child. She earned her B.A. in English literature, minoring in education, at Barat College of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic college in Lake Forest, Illinois, in 1953. After graduation she took some teaching jobs; later she worked as a travel agent. In December 1954, she married Thomas Joseph Kerwin (1930–2008), a graduate of Loyola University. They had six sons, one of whom died in infancy, and three daughters. ==La Leche League== In 1956 Kerwin's sister-in-law, Mary White, invited her to the inaugural meeting of La Leche League at White's home. The idea for a breastfeeding advocacy organization was developed by White and Marian Tompson while they breastfed their infants at a church picnic in summer 1956. At the time, American mothers interested in natural childbirth and breastfeeding received little support from the medical community. In the US, only one in five newborns were breastfed from birth; most were immediately fed from bottles. Other women approached the two to discuss their experiences breastfeeding their infants and the discouragement they had received from pediatricians. White and Thompson decided to start a breastfeeding advocacy group and invited a few women, who invited their acquaintances; the seven founders were White, Tompson, Kerwin, Edwina Froehlich, Viola Lennon, Mary Ann Cahill, and Betty Wagner, all Catholic mothers. Kerwin, expecting her second child at the time, had received help from White and her husband, Dr. Gregory White, a family doctor, to successfully breastfeed her first baby. The women held several meetings at White's house in Franklin Park, Illinois, to discuss the type of information and support breastfeeding mothers would need. They held their first official meeting on October 17, 1956 at White's house, attended by the seven founders and five of their acquaintances who were expecting. Their second meeting drew 30 attendees, and the fourth attracted a standing-room-only audience. The women developed a series of monthly educational meetings, and near the end of the decade began publishing informational material. In 1958 Kerwin co-authored the group's first handbook, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. In 1960 the Kerwins moved to Denver, where they purchased the Cranmer House, residing there for three decades. Kerwin founded the Colorado chapter of La Leche League and also served as chair of the international board. ==Legal career== In 1986 Kerwin earned her J.D. at the University of Denver. She practiced family law and general litigation until retiring. As the Colorado Breast-feeding Task Force Legislation Representative for the Colorado Breast-feeding Coalition, Kerwin drafted several pieces of legislation on behalf of nursing women. The two that were passed into law were the 2004 Breastfeeding in Public Act and the 2008 Nursing Mothers' Act for Workplace Accommodation. In 2006 Kerwin withdrew her draft legislation aimed at protecting a woman's right to pump breast milk in the workplace due to lack of support from the governor. ==Awards and honors== Kerwin was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012. ==References and sources== References Sources * * Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:Breastfeeding activists Category:Colorado lawyers Category:University of Denver alumni Category:Barat College alumni Category:Activists from Wisconsin Category:American health activists Category:Activists from Colorado Category:American women lawyers Category:American women activists Category:Travel agents (people) ","title":"Mary Ann Kerwin"},{"id":"56715269","text":"Southborough Pit is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Tunbridge Wells in Kent.

Her films include LANCE, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind, Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic and Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, which won two Emmy awards. ==Early life and education== Zenovich was born in Fresno, California. She is the daughter of George N. Zenovich, a former California State Senator and Judge of Serbian heritage, and Vera \\"Kika\\"” Zenovich, who was born in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. Her sister is actress Ninon Zenovich (aka Ninon Aprea). The Fifth District Court of Appeals Courthouse in Fresno is named after her father. When he died in 2013, she made a film for the memorial service to celebrate his life. Zenovich graduated from Bullard High School in Fresno, California. Zenovich first studied drama at the University of Southern California and then switched majors, graduating with a degree in Journalism. During college, she worked for Hollywood producer Mike Frankovich and also in the press department of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. Following graduation, Zenovich moved to New York City, where she acted in short films and off-Broadway plays. Zenovich studied acting at the William Esper Studio in Manhattan, furthering her studies with Ron Burrus and Stella Adler. She later acted in several movies including Robert Altman's The Player and actress Talia Shire's One Night Stand. Zenovich’s voiceover work includes Alex Gibney's Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. She is also the voice of a rubber band in the 2011 children's film Bands on the Run. In 1997, Zenovich began working as a segment producer on John Pierson's TV series Split Screen, which was broadcast on the Independent Film Channel. Due to her work on Split Screen, she became interested in becoming a director and working on feature documentaries. ==Career== ===Independent's Day=== Shot in 1996–1997, Zenovich’s first film Independent's Day premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival in 1998. The documentary was inspired by the three filmmakers who founded the aforementioned festival, after being rejected by the more established Sundance Film Festival. Zenovich's documentary explores the struggles of independent filmmakers and includes interviews with Steven Soderbergh, Greg Mottola, Tom DiCillo, Eric Schaeffer, Sydney Pollack, Parker Posey, Roger Ebert, John Pierson, among others. While screening Independent’s Day on the festival circuit, Zenovich met investor Bob Sturm who hired her to work at his new film company Catch 23 Entertainment. Zenovich started out in the development department and went on to become Senior Vice President of Film Development & Production, while continuing to make documentaries on the side. ===Who Is Bernard Tapie?=== Zenovich's next film idea came about in 1997, after a screening at the Directors Guild of America, where French filmmaker Claude Lelouch introduced his film Hommes, femmes, mode d'emploi. Lelouche mentioned that the star of the film, Bernard Tapie, was in jail, prompting Zenovich to find out why. She spent several years going back and forth to Paris, shooting footage for Who Is Bernard Tapie? Unable to get an interview with Tapie, Zenovich filmed herself as she tried to contact the actor/businessman, hoping to get his attention. The 2001 documentary, with Steven Soderbergh as its executive producer, was aired on the Sundance Channel and as an episode of the BBC's Storyville series. Zenovich was also profiled in the New York Times about her quest to make the documentary. ===Estonia Dreams of Eurovision!=== Zenovich also appeared on camera in her following film Estonia Dreams of Eurovision! She traveled to Tallinn, Estonia to document the preparations leading up to hosting the Eurovision Song Contest. The 2003 film was broadcast as part of the BBC series Arena and also on the Sundance Channel. It was produced by Vikram Jayanti. ===Art in Progress (TV series)=== In the early 2000s, Zenovich worked on the series Art in Progress for Gallery HD, an arts channel part of Voom HD Networks. She traveled the world filming profiles of artists as they prepared for major exhibitions. Her episodes include: Tim Noble & Sue Webster: Now Here (in Athens, Greece); Julian Schnabel in Naples; David Lynch in Milan; Vanessa Beecroft in Berlin; Robert Wilson: Video Portraits (in Paris); Takashi Murakami (in Los Angeles); John Baldessari (in Belgium); Damien Elwes (in Santa Monica); and Sam Maloof (in Claremont). ===Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired=== Zenovich came up with the subject of her next documentary film, after reading a story in the Los Angeles Times in 2003. The article questioned whether director Roman Polanski could re-enter the United States, if nominated for an Oscar for The Pianist. Polanski had fled the U.S. in the late 1970s after being accused of sexual assault of a minor. Five years in the making, Zenovich's Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, receiving wide media attention. The film's editor Joe Bini won the award for Best Editing. The documentary received a Special Screening at the Cannes Film Festival. Entertainment Weekly called it \\"A film of rare fascination and power.\\" The film also won two Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming (shared with Joe Bini & P.G. Morgan). Wanted and Desired was selected by the National Board of Review as one of the Best Documentaries of 2008. ===Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out=== Soon after its release, Polanski’s legal team used the film Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired as part of their argument for reopening the 30 year old case. Since her documentary about the film director was being used as evidence, Zenovich decided to continue shooting the story. The result was a follow-up film, Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out. The second documentary was originally meant to examine how the central characters felt about the incident. Zenovich filmed Samantha Gailey and her mother in Hawaii, and also planned on meeting Polanski for an interview. However, two months before the scheduled interview, Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on his way to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Zurich Film Festival. As a result, Zenovich's follow-up film became linked to a big international news story. Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out debuted at the Toronto Film Festival in 2012 and subsequently played at the New York Film Festival, also airing on the Showtime network. ===Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic=== Zenovich's next film, Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic, was made for Showtime and executive produced by Roy Ackerman. The documentary features interviews with Robin Williams, Mike Epps, Bob Newhart, Mel Brooks, David Banks, Whoopi Goldberg and an interview with Pryor's lawyer Skip Brittenham. Zenovich came up with the film's title during her interview with writer David Banks, who stated, \\"With Richard, you have to omit the logic.\\" The documentary premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2013 where Zenovich participated in a discussion with Tracy Morgan, Wyatt Cenac, Walter Mosley and Jennifer Pryor. The panel was moderated by writer Jacob Bernstein. Omit the Logic won the NAACP Image Award for Best Television Documentary. The film's editor Chris A. Peterson was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Editing. ===Fantastic Lies=== In 2014, Zenovich addressed another controversial story, the 2006 Duke Lacrosse scandal. The resulting film, Fantastic Lies, was aired on ESPN's 30 for 30 series and earned positive reviews. The documentary premiered at SXSW Film Festival in 2016, also receiving nominations for Best Sports Documentary and Best TV/Streaming Documentary at the Critics Choice Awards. ===Water & Power: A California Heist=== In 2016 Zenovich took on the California water crisis.

It was founded in 1840 as Reale Opificio Borbonico di Pietrarsa (Royal Bourbon Factory of Pietrarsa). From 7 October 1989 the workshops, closed at the end of 1975, became the home of the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa. ==History== The Officine di Pietrarsa, or Reale Opificio was conceived in 1840 by decree of Ferdinando II di Borbone as a plant capable of producing war and civilian material using iron from the Mongiana ironworks. A first factory had been built between San Giovanni a Teduccio and Portici in 1832, using land previously occupied by a coastal artillery battery. In 1842, therefore only two years after the decree had been issued, the first building and ancillary rooms had already been completed, where about 200 workers worked among turners, adjusters, forgers and carpenters under the direction of the Captain of the Artillery, Don Luigi Corsi and other army officers who assisted him. It is no coincidence that the Captain Corsi was chosen as director; he was already known to Ferdinand II for his invention of the famous \\"incendiary balls\\", a sort of shells that were inextinguishable in the water and for this reason they are very efficient in dripping down the enemy ship. Captain Corsi was born in Lucera, near Foggia on February 16, 1802. He was the son of Colonel Dionisio Corsi, a cavalry officer and Intendant General of the Province of L'Aquila, and Donna Filomena Carrascon, herself from a family of distinguished military officers (see Carascon). On 22 May 1843 Ferdinando II issued an edict in which he said among other things: \\"It is Your Majesty's will that the factory of Pietrarsa takes care of the construction of the locomotives, as well as the repairs and needs for the locomotives themselves, the accessories of the wagons and wagons that will travel the new Naples - Capua railway\\". The goal was to free himself from foreign dependence on the production of the equipment required for the extension of the Ionian and Adriatic lines, started on the shore of the Tyrrhenian Sea. On 28 June 1844 the overhaul of the first two steam locomotives that had been built in England began. They were named Impavido (Fearless) and Aligero (Lightening). A similar locomotive, Bayard, had been built in England by R. B. Longridge and Company in 1839 and a replica is displayed in the museum. ===Production=== In 1845, production of steam locomotives began. They were designed and partially built in England but assembled on site. There were seven locomotives, which used component parts built in England, similar to the previous models purchased in 1843 that had inaugurated the first Italian railway line, the Naples–Portici railway. They were named Pietrarsa, La Corsi, Robertson, Vesuvio, Maria Teresa, Etna and Parthenope. In 1853, the work force of Pietrarsa reached about 700 people. On 18 May 1852, in the metallurgical department, a gigantic statue of Ferdinando II was produced as a monobloc iron casting. At about 4.5 metres high, it was one of the largest works of this kind produced in Italy. It is still exhibited in the museum. In 1856 Pietrarsa was the first factory in Italy to produce rails with puddled iron from Mongiana. However, their cost was high, owing to the high price of coal imported from England. The cost of locomotives with tenders produced at the plant was acceptable and Pietrarsa was one of only two industrial plants in Italy able to produce steam locomotives at the time. The expansion of the factory continued until the end of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, supplying material of all kinds to the railways of the kingdom. In June 1860 Pietrarsa employed 1,125 people. This comprised 850 permanent workers, 200 casual workers and 75 artillerymen to keep order. At the time, it was the largest Italian engineering factory. ===Visiting dignitaries=== The plant had several important visitors including that of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who expressed his intention to use Pietrarsa as a model for the Kronstadt railway complex. In 1849 the plant was visited by Pope Pius IX. ===Ironworks commission=== In 1861 the Minister of the Navy Luigi Federico Menabrea established a Commissione delle ferriere (Commission of the ironworks) whose minute investigation analyzed the status of all the relevant industrial activities located on the territory of the Kingdom. The final report of the triennial investigation was published in 1864 under the care of the engineer Felice Giordano. The report showed that the costs of production of the locomotives of the two most important plants of the time (Sampierdarena and Pietrarsa) were more or less equivalent or slightly higher than those of the foreign industry. The meticulous analysis of costs and activities performed by Giordano quantified in detail the remuneration of skilled workers by category and the raw material costs of imported metal semi- finished materials. The costs at Ansaldo and Pietrarsa were shown to be substantially equivalent but the pre-eminence of these companies ended with the Bourbon regime and its protectionist policies. The higher production costs of steel products produced in the territory of the Kingdom stemmed from their foreign origin as well as the high cost of supplying the indispensable British coal. Between 1861 and 1863 the Pietrarsa factory went into a difficult phase of its life. A report by the engineer Grandis, commissioned by the Savoy government, negatively portrayed the activity and profitability of the plant, even advising its sale or demolition. A decision was made to rationalize the steel and production sector and this choice favoured the northern industry. On 10 January 1863, the Pietrarsa plant with its contents was leased, for 30 years in the sum of 45,000 lira by the Minister of Finance of the Minghetti government to a company established by Iacopo Bozza. This resulted in job reductions, strikes and serious disorder, leading to bloody repression. On 6 August 1863 a charge of the Bersaglieri caused 7 deaths and 20 serious injuries. The first deaths were Luigi Fabbricini, Aniello Marino, Domenico Del Grosso and Aniello Olivieri. After this, the lease was renounced and, on 20 September 1863, the government granted a new lease on the plant for 20 years to a new company, called Società nazionale di costruzioni meccaniche. This was run by the knight Gregorio Macry, the Duke Luciano Serra, the Marquis Cesare Pallavicino and the knights Maurizio Baracco and Giuseppe Carabelli. The rent started at 45,000 lira and increased every 5 years to reach a maximum of 70,000 lira. Also, the concession provided for the right to dismiss staff deemed not necessary. From 1863, Pietrarsa incorporated l'Officina dei Granili, producing metal structural works, railway carriages and mechanical parts. ===Commission report=== According to the final report of the Ironworks Commission, before 1863 the Pietrarsa workshops occupied an area of 33,600 square metres and had 850 workers. The equipment was of great importance as it was able to put on the production line at the same time 8 marine boilers or 24 locomotive boilers. The department of ironworks was equipped with 12 puddling ovens and 5 rolling mill trains, one of which was specialized for rails. The foundry department had a 12.5 tonne reverberatory furnace and 10 ovens of various types with capacities of 8.5 tonnes and 250 kg for a complex of 36 tonnes of workable iron. The foundry also had a bronze department with a 1,880 kg reverberatory oven, a 600 kg oven and various other small ovens and crucibles. The equipment was completed by three steam hammers (of 4,500, 3,500 and 800 kg) and 4 large cranes as well as all accessory equipment. ===Contraction and expansion=== A locomotive for freight trains built at Pietrarsa earned a gold medal at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. However, the drastic downsizing of Pietrarsa's labour force continued until only 100 workers remained. In 1877 the state finally intervened and took over the management directly under the direction of the engineer Passerini. This revived the company's fortunes and reversed the decline in production capacity. From 1877 to 1885, about 110 locomotives were produced, over 800 freight wagons and nearly 300 passenger carriages as well as spare parts for rolling stock. Following the Conventions of 1885 and the establishment of large railway networks, the Pietrarsa workshops were assigned to the Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean Network) and remained part of it until 1905 when, following railway nationalization, the factory became part of the primary infrastructure of the new Ferrovie dello Stato becoming one of the large repair workshops specializing in particular in steam locomotives. ==Review== According to data provided by the official list of locomotives and railcars in service and under construction at 30 June 1914, published in 1915 by Ferrovie dello Stato, Pietrarsa produced, between 1867 and 1888, hundreds of steam locomotives with tenders for Rete Mediterranea (the Mediterranean Network), Rete Adriatica (the Adriatic Network) and their constituents. Of these, 192 were taken over by FS and registered as classes 120, 155, 185, 190, 200, 206, 215, 265, 268, 385, 391 and 420. However, after 1888, orders for the construction of locomotives were directed to foreign factories or to northern Italy and Pietrarsa was downgraded to a maintenance and repair plant. New railway traction systems (electric and diesel) gradually displaced steam and led to the slow but inexorable decline of the plant until a closure order was issued on 15 November 1975. The last steam locomotive to be repaired (640.088) left the workshops on 2 December of the same year. After a long period of neglect, the decision was made to transform Pietrarsa into a railway museum, housing it in the same environment that had been the oldest Italian locomotive factory. The inauguration of the Museum took place on 7 October 1989 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Italian railways. Later it was closed again and, after a long period of renovation, the museum was reopened on 19 December 2007. ==References== ==Further reading== * Felice Giordano, L'industria del ferro in Italia:relazione per la Commissione delle ferriere ist. dal Ministero della Marina, Torino, Tipografia Cotta e Capellino, 1864.

The equipment was introduced in 1928 and was the standard light bridge used for loads up to class 5, i.e. providing rafts or a bridge capable of transporting loads up to 5 tons of weight. The initial version was followed by a Mk II but without change of capacity. In 1938 the Mk III version of the bridge was introduced with significant changes and an increase of load capacity to 9 tons, i.e. load class 9. The Mk III version of the bridge was easy and quick to erect, which led in 1939 to its becoming the standard light bridging equipment, initially of the British armies, and the Allied armies during World War II. The Mk III equipment was capable of providing class 5 and 9 pontoon rafts, or a class 9 bridge. The equipment provided anchoring facilities and a full width trackway. It performed well even in fast currents and could be maintained and kept in use indefinitely. The FBE Mk III was used extensively during World War II by both British and American forces as the standard class 9 bridge. The FBE was widely used in both the European and South-East Asian theatres of war. ==Configuration and deployment== A 25-pdr field gun and jeep being transported on a class 5 FBE Mk III decked raft ferry down the Kalapanzin River from Buthidaung, January 1945.The equipment provided the following capabilities: * Class 3 Tracked Raft, F.B.E. (ramp and deck parallel to the length of the boat). * Class 5 Bridge, F.B.E., Mk. II. * Class 5 Decked Raft Ferries, F.B.E. Mk. II and Mk. III. (ramp and deck perpendicular to the length of the boat). * Class 9 Bridge, F.B.E., Mk. III. Bridges are constructed by joining rafts together. The connectors have limited articulation, which permits the FBE Mk II bridge to carry a load of class 5 while an FBE MK III bridge can carry a vehicle of load class 9 (approximately 10 tons). The trestles are set up at each end and fix the end of the bridge to the bank. Anchors are placed at different positions along the length to anchor the bridge from being swept away by a changed current. ==Parts== Layout and parts of FBE Mk IIIFolding Boat Equipment bridge consists of the following parts: * Folding boats. These could be used singly as an assault boat in combination of two to four boats to form a raft or ferry, or connected together with a deck trackway to form a bridge. * Superstructure. For both rafts and bridge. * Trestles. Used to anchor each end of the bridge. * Anchors and anchor stores. * Rafting gear and folding dinghies for assault boats. ===Folding Boat=== FBE boat in use as a ferry with outboard motor fitted on a fabricated frame. Each folding boat was 21 feet 10 inches long and 6 feet 8 inches wide, collapsible and could be carried flat on four-wheeled trailers or in bridging lorries. Three flat boats fitted on a trailer. Sixteen soldiers were required for manual carriage and launching a single boat.

If triplet-triplet annihilation occurs between two molecules in their excited states one molecule transfers its excited state energy to the second molecule, resulting in one molecule returning to its ground state and the second molecule being promoted to a higher excited singlet, triplet or quintet state. Triplet-triplet annihilation was first discovered in the 1960s to explain the observation of delayed fluorescence in anthracene derivatives.Parker, C. A., Hatchard, C. G., Delayed Fluorescence from Solutions of Anthracene and Phenanthrene. Proc. R. Soc. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 1962, 269 (1339), 147.Parker, C. A., Hatchard, C.

Commun., 1967, 6 (15), 744. ==Photon upconversion== As triplet-triplet annihilation combines the energy of two triplet excited molecules onto one molecule to produce a higher excited state it has been used to convert the energy of two photons into one photon of higher energy, a process known as photon upconversion.Singh-Rachford, T. N., Castellano, F. N., Photon Upconversion Based on Sensitized Triplet-Triplet Annihilation, Coord. Chem. Rev., 2010, 254, 21-22, 2560-2573.Gray, V., Moth- Poulsen, K., Albinsson, B., Abrahamsson, M., Towards Efficient Solid-State Triplet-Triplet Annihilation Based Photon Upconversion: Supramolecular, Macromolecular and Self-Assembled Systems, Coord. Chem. Rev. 2018, 362, 54-71. To achieve photon upconversion through triplet-triplet annihilation two types of molecules are often combined: a sensitizer and an emitter (annihilator). The sensitizer absorbs the low energy photon and populates its first excited triplet state (T1) through intersystem crossing. The sensitizer then transfers the excitation energy to the emitter, resulting in a triplet excited emitter and a ground state sensitizer. Two triplet excited emitters then can undergo triplet-triplet annihilation, and if a singlet excited state (S1) of the emitter is populated fluorescence results in an upconverted photon.

The Łańcut Castle Museum began the Ulma- Family Museum's construction in 2013, and the new Museum opened on 17 March 2016. On 30 June 2017, pursuant to an agreement of 23 June 2017 entered into by Subcarpathian Province and Poland's Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, the Museum was incorporated as an independent legal entity, to be operated jointly by the two parties. The Ulma-Family Museum is entered in Poland's Register of Cultural Organizations as No. RIK 103/2017. ==History== The decision to build the museum was taken by the Subcarpathian Regional Assembly in June 2008. A space of 500 square meters was allocated for a restoration of the Ulma family home and for an exhibition hall, lecture hall, and research facility. Construction cost 6.5 million złotych. In its first year of operation, the Ulma-Family Museum hosted 50,000 visitors. ==The structure and its surroundings == The designers created a semi-glazed facade that conceals a mystery that visitors will discover. The building juts into the square. The front of the museum is a universal symbolic representation of a house, reminiscent of the history of pre-war Markowa. It suggests both the times of the Shoah, and unchanging form and persistence in the face of historical adversities. The exhibition covers some 120 square meters.2. The wall in front of the museum displays plaques with names of Poles who saved Jews. In the square before the museum are illuminated tablets with the names of those who died saving Jews. Due to limited space, the names of only those who were active in present-day Subcarpathian Province are given. Next to the museum itself, a garden is being created that will commemorate with illuminated plaques the Polish cities and towns where Jewish residents were rescued by the 6,700 persons recognized as the Polish Righteous among the Nations. Some 1,500 such places have been identified. The memorial garden will incorporate the monument to the Ulma family, erected in 2004, that stands in the Markowa open-air museum. == Exhibit == The museum commemorates all the Poles who, at the risk of their own lives, saved Jews condemned by the Germans to extermination. It was named after Markowa's Ulma family (Józef Ulma, his wife Wiktoria, and their six children), who were murdered by German gendarmes on 24 March 1944, along with the eight Jews whom they had been sheltering. Other Polish Markowa residents succeeded in saving 21 Jews. Due to limited space, the exhibit mainly contains audiovisual material and texts. According to Joerg Hackmann, the general impression the exhibit conveys is that of innocent Polish martyrs with underlying religious tones of beatification. The role of Jewish self agency is also not addressed in the exhibition.Hackmann, Jörg. \\"Defending the “Good Name” of the Polish Nation: Politics of History as a Battlefield in Poland, 2015–18.\\" Journal of Genocide Research 20.4 (2018): 587-606.

With his historical detection reaction from 1904, the lactose content of dairy products can be visualized. This is useful because many people are lactose intolerant and avoid dairy products. Countless pharmacy students, but also physicians, laboratory assistants, and recently also chemistry teachers know the Wöhlk test. Since its discovery in 1904 until the 1960s, the Wöhlk test has mainly been used to detect the reducing disaccharide lactose in urine in medical laboratories. Although there were already a number of wet-chemical detection methods to identify sugars, such as the Fehling or Benedict test, those analyses could only differentiate between reducing and non-reducing sugars. Since both glucose and lactose molecules have an aldehyde group in the open-chain form, the result was positive in both cases. Only the Woehlk test allowed a safe differentiation between glucose and lactose.http://www.chemistryviews.org/details/education/10821368/150_Years_Alfred_wohlk.html Thus, a relatively harmless milk congestion (lactosuria) could be differentiated from a dangerous gestational diabetes. With lactose, the tested urine develops a significant red color, with glucose, only a yellow dye develops, and with sucrose, the color does not change. Until recently there were no or only insufficient ideas about the constitution of the Woehlk and Fearon dyes and their formation. Based on the reactions known in the chemistry of carbohydrates, a structure was created which is consistent with previous experimental observations and has the corresponding features of a chromophore. It was assumed that in the Woehlk and Fearon test for lactose and maltose, the reaction of ammonia and methylamine occurs via the formyl group in C1 and the hydroxyl group in C5 forming a partially saturated heterocyclic pyridine ring. == References == Category:1868 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Danish chemists ","title":"Alfred Wöhlk"},{"id":"56715988","text":"Konflit, formerly Konflit Dramatik, are a Canadian rap rock band, most prominent in the 2000s.Johanne Melançon and Lucie Hotte, Introduction à la littérature franco-ontarienne.

At the end of the Crimean War he went on a trip to Europe, where he explored several museums and exhibitions and decided to expand his father's collection. He began to actively buy up contemporary paintings and sculptures, mainly from France and in large part directly from the artists or their dealers. In a very short time he managed to expand the collection significantly - despite (or perhaps because of) his lack of age, experience and knowledge he appreciated modern artists such as Theodore Rousseau, Jules Dupré, Delacroix, Jean-François Millet, Constant Troyon Courbet and Corot and brought the Barbizon school to the attention of Russian audiences.

From 2013 to 2018 he was on the board of Telia Company. Since April 2019 he has been an expert on Sweden's immigrants' integration issues for Moderate Party commission New Swedish Model. == Career == While back in primary school, Särlaskolan in Borås, Lorentzon was telling classmates that he wanted to sell one matchbox to every Chinese person and became a billionaire. In high school he attended the technical department of Sven Eriksonsgymnasiet where he liked to visit every party but always put education first: Before a test he lied that got sick and have to stay home. In 1990 he joined Chalmers University of Technology where he studied Industrial Economics and later finished with a degree of Master of science and engineering. Simultaneously in Gothenburg he attended economics courses at Business School and had internship at Volvo Torslanda. In 1995 he started an internship at a telephone company Telia, After building a great relationship with his boss he moved to San Francisco and got to work in the AltaVista office. In Silicon Valley he met skilled web-entrepreneurs and found a job at a investing company called Cell Ventures, where met a Swedish clothing line called Joy owners' son — Felix Hagnö. Hagnö told Lorentzon that it is hard for a small company to find consumers online and they decided to solve this problem. In September 1999 Lorentzon and Hagnö founded Netstrategy which would later become the leading European marketplace Tradedoubler. The company soon became commercially profitable and socially acclaimed: in 2001 it won the Swedish Guldmusen prize for \\"IT-rookie of the Year\\", in 2002 the Swedish Trade Council in the United Kingdom prize \\"Achievement Award\\" for Swedish companies that have been the most successful in the UK during the past year, in 2004 Swedish \\"Export Hermes\\" prize as the best Swedish exporting company. It was then when Lorentzon learned negotiation with possible investors. He moves to Germany. Web sales are on peak and in 2005 he sold his Tradedoubler option for US$70 million. He admits the role of luck in this success. He moved back to Sweden after ten years abroad. In March 2006 Tradedoubler bought advertising service Advertigo that was created by young Daniel Ek. The two quickly became friends and found they both experienced depression because of unexpected wealth and a lack of purpose. One year later since moving in a new apartment in April 2005 Lorentzon has bought only a mattress and an IKEA chair. He studied Economics in Stockholm School of Economics and took courses in rhetoric and argumentation in Stockholm University. During April 2013 — March 2018 Lorentzon has served as a member of the board of directors at Telia, his first job where he also owned 230 thousands shares. He said that he stepped down due to lack of interest although before Telia tried to sell its entire holding in Spotify prior to their stock exchange listing that would harm the company. He is one of investors for student.com — a service that helps students find accommodation. === Spotify === In April 2006 Ek and Lorentzon decided to start a new company that they won't sell. Martin left the board of Tradedoubler and sent one million euros to Ek. In June of 2006 Spotify was registered — A music streaming service that earns profit from online advertising, a business that they both knew very well. Martin spent his own money on developers' salaries, offices and renting music licenses. They tried to attract investors' money, but Martin was not satisfied with the conditions on which they were offered to cooperate. Because of these unplanned expenses, Martin's share in Spotify turned out to be the largest — his option is estimated at more than US$ 4 billion, he holds 43.3% voting rights and owns 12.7% shares. Hagnö who decided to help the new idea of the former colleague owns 6.6% of the shares worth US$1.5 billion. Lorentzon was a Chief Executive Officer 2006 — 2013 and a Chairman of board of directors 2008 — 2016, until Ek took these roles. In interviews they claim that they are best friends and there has not been a day since 2006 when they didn't speak at least once a day. Martin is responsible for developing the company's future goals and development strategy, budget, salaries, verification of legal and annual financial reports. == Political views == In 2013 he joined Prince Daniel's Fellowship project and now visits upper secondary schools, universities and university colleges around Sweden to inspire young people to get involved in entrepreneurship. In 2016 he was elected as a member of Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences under the Department of Education and Research, which promotes contact and exchange between business, research, and government. In April 2013, media debated Lorentzon's relationship with Swedish tax office. Lorentzon's companies that are affiliated with Spotify and Telia are situated in Offshore financial centres: Rosello is registered on Cyprus, Amaltea is in Luxembourg. In 2005, he re-registered TradeDoubler on Cyprus and thereby reduced the tax payment by $9 million. In 2006 he paid 1.4 million euro as taxes. Spotify was also re- registered by that time in Luxembourg, where income tax is low. According to media reports, Martin owes the Swedish tax office 6 million euro for 2007–2010, during which he filed a zero-income declaration. He responded by claiming that it is difficult to attract venture capital to his ideas in Sweden, as well as pointing to the taxes he and his company pays in Sweden. As a result, in 2014 Lorentzon was named International Swede of the Year and in 2015 got an award Affärsbragden (The Business Achievement) from the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. In the spring of 2015 Lorentzon was given an honorary doctorate at Chalmers University of Technology. In April 2019 Lorentzon was assigned an immigrants' integration issues expert in a Moderate Party commission New Swedish Model created by Ulf Kristersson. ==Personal life== Martin Lorentzon was born on 1 April 1969 in the south of Sweden in the village Åsenhöga in the Gnosjö region of Småland province. In February 1970, his family moved to Borås, and he grew up in the Hestra quarter. His mother, Brita (born 21 September 1936), worked as a teacher, and his father, Sven, (born 1 July 1932) as an economist.

During this period motive power was confined to steam locomotives, some of which by mid-century were capable of top speeds of , with average express journey speeds of . The 1880s saw the development of electric power and its application to rail transport. Electric power offered several advantages over steam; it is more efficient, allowing more rapid acceleration, and a higher power output when necessary. Its disadvantage is the high initial cost of the infrastructure involved, such as the power production and distribution system needed. 1879 saw the demonstration of an experimental system by Werner von Siemens in Berlin, which was followed by an electric tramway at Lichterfelde, in 1881, and heavy rail applications in 1890 (the City and South London Railway) and 1895 (the Baltimore Belt Line). In 1899 a consortium of ten of the largest and wealthiest companies in Germany joined together to form the \\"Research Association for High-speed Electric Railways\\"(de) (Studiengesellschaft für elektrische Schnellbahnen, or St.E.S.) to examine the possibilities of high-speed electric rail travel. == Research Association for High-speed Electric Railways== The St.E.S consortium, which included Siemens & Halske, the engineering company AEG, and the Deutsche Bank, was founded on 10 October 1899 and given leave to electrify a length of the Royal Prussian Military Railway between Marienfelde, near Berlin, and Zossen, a distance of . The line was electrified with three-phase power at 10 kV/50 Hz, using three overhead lines on poles that were about high located at the side of the track. This work was completed by the spring of 1901. ==The three-phase railcar== The society commissioned two railcars for testing. These were built by , a Cologne rolling-stock manufacturer and consortium member, with Siemens and AEG supplying the electrical equipment. The cars were of standard size, with a capacity for 50 passengers, mounted on two six-wheel bogies, the outer axle being motorized. The power was drawn down from the three power cables running along the side of the track by three vertical catenaries, mounted on two towers fore and aft on the roof of the carriage. The electrical system was rated at 6–14 kV, operating at 25–50 Hz, giving a power equivalent of . The summer of 1901 saw a series of test runs, culminating in record-breaking speeds of . These tests revealed weaknesses in the trackbed, which had to be re-laid. Following this, in the autumn of 1903, a series of high-speed runs were achieved; of , by the Siemens railcar, on 6 October, and , by the AEG railcar, three weeks later, on 28 October 1903. This set a land speed record for rail vehicles (electric) which stood for the next 51 years.Zossen.de The tests had shown what was possible with electric motive power, but the three- phase system was too complex, and the cost of installation too prohibitive, for general use across the rail network. With this the St.E.S was wound up and the infrastructure dismantled. However advances in technology, particularly in semiconductors, are believed to offer new possibilities with the three-phase system. ==See also== *Three-phase AC railway electrification ==Notes== ===References=== * Category:Rolling stock innovations Category:Land speed record rail vehicles Category:German inventions Category:Electric rail transport ","title":"Experimental three-phase railcar"},{"id":"56716446","text":"Canon Edward Paroissien Eddrup (1823 – 13 November 1905) was a Church of England clergyman who spent most of his career in Wiltshire, England.

It is a prequel to the 2016 video game Bombshell. Ion Fury runs on a modified version of Ken Silverman's Build engine and is the first original commercial game to utilize the engine in 20 years, the previous being World War II GI. ==Plot== In Ion Fury, the player assumes the role of Shelly \\"Bombshell\\" Harrison, a bomb disposal expert aligned to the Global Defense Force. Dr. Jadus Heskel, a transhumanist cult leader, unleashes an army of cybernetically-enhanced soldiers on the futuristic dystopian city of Neo D.C., which Shelly is tasked with fighting through. ==Development== Ion Fury is built on EDuke32, a fork of the Build engine which supports modern operating systems while also implementing a broader range of features. The source code of Ion Fury is part of the EDuke32 source port. ==Lawsuit== In May 2019, it was announced that the band Iron Maiden would be suing 3D Realms for $2 million for \\"[the] misappropriation and use of a virtually identical imitation of the Iron Maiden trademark\\". 3D Realms quickly responded on Twitter, stating that these are \\"frivolous claims anyone who has played Ion Maiden would find more over the top than Shelly’s 'Loverboy', her signature 18-round triple-barreled revolver\\". The lawsuit claims that Ion Maiden \\"has the same look and feel\\" to the Android/iOS game Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast previously released on July 5, 2016. It also lists several alleged similarities, including the name \\"Ion Maiden\\", the font used for the game title, the main character Shelly 'Bombshell' Harrison and Steve Harris, the skull symbol, and the Eddie character. However, several of the allegedly similar elements cited in the lawsuit were present in a previous 3D Realms game, Bombshell, released on January 29, 2016, including the main character name and the skull symbol. According to Scott Miller, founder of 3D Realms, \\"The name Ion Maiden comes from the basic weapon used by the same female hero in her first game, Bombshell.\\" On July 11, 2019, 3D Realms announced that the title of Ion Maiden was changed to Ion Fury. Also announced was that voice actor Jon St. John, best known for the character Duke Nukem, was confirmed to be voicing the game's main villain. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Ion Fury received positive reviews with an averaging of 78 score on Metacritic. IGN gave the game a score of 7.5/10, saying it \\"authentic throwback to Duke Nukem 3D that certainly hails to the king but can't quite dethrone him.\\" PCGamesN's Chris Capel called it \\"probably the best Build engine game ever\\" and \\"challenging, funny, cleverly designed, and shockingly attractive.\\" GameRevolution's Alex Santa Maria called it \\"an updated take on Duke Nukem 3D that goes above and beyond nostalgic pandering to become one of the better first-person shooters in recent memory.\\" Game Informer's Javy Gwaltney called it \\"everything that I've wanted from a modernized take on the arcadey shooters of the 90s. The pitch-perfect movement, the enemy variety, creative weaponry, and fantastic level design all add up to a superb shooter campaign.\\" === Awards === Ion Fury won Player's Choice Indie of the Year 2019 at IndieDB. ===Controversy=== On August 16, 2019, less than a day after the official release, Discord chat logs from members of Voidpoint were shared, displaying purportedly transphobic remarks by the developers. Additionally, two text messages were found in the game that some called homophobic; one a parody of Olay soap, another a hidden text string from a disgruntled anonymous developer insulting his coworkers. Following multiple requests for a comment on the situation by gaming news sites and retro gaming-focused YouTube personalities, Voidpoint and 3D Realms apologized and pledged to institute a zero-tolerance policy on \\"disparaging language.\\" They also pledged to remove two lines of in-game text. Additionally, $10,000 of Ion Fury's initial sales were donated to the Trevor Project. The developer response yielded mixed reactions, including a considerable increase in negative reviews on the game's Steam page, many of which accused the developers of censorship. On August 26, 2019, the developers reversed their stance and stated that they would only remove one of the messages, containing a slur, but no other content.

He spent 25 years as an engineering professor at Zhejiang University and won two national science and technology awards, before entering politics and being sent to Hong Kong in 1985 to prepare for the British colony's return to China. During his tenure as Beijing's chief spokesman in Hong Kong, he fiercely clashed with Chris Patten, the last British governor in Hong Kong, over the latter's effort to implement political reforms over Beijing's objection. Their public dispute dominated news headlines in Hong Kong. After the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, Zhang returned to Zhejiang University to serve as its Party Secretary. He oversaw the school's merger with three other universities and used his Hong Kong connections to raise funds for the university. == Early life and scientific career == Zhang was born in 1936 in Changting County, Fujian Province. After graduating from high school in 1954, he was admitted to Zhejiang University (ZJU) in Hangzhou, where he studied optical engineering. At the university he met his future wife Yang Huiyi (), a student from Shanghai. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1956, and was hired by the university as a faculty member after his graduation in 1958. In the 1960s, he and his colleagues designed a solar telescope. After the delay caused by the Cultural Revolution, it was put into production in the 1970s and won a National Science and Technology Prize (second class) in 1982. He co-founded the laser program at Zhejiang University in 1973 and won another National Science and Technology Prize (second class) for a solar spectrometer, for which he designed the mechanical components. He was promoted to party secretary of ZJU's Optical Engineering Department in 1978. == Career in Hong Kong == In 1983, Zhang was appointed deputy party secretary of Hangzhou, beginning his political career. After the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, which announced that Great Britain would transfer sovereignty over Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997, Zhang was assigned to the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua News Agency, the de facto Chinese embassy in British Hong Kong, to work for the preparation of the handover. He served as deputy director, then director of the Hong Kong branch's publicity department, before being promoted to deputy director and spokesman of the branch in 1988. When Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, attempted to implement political reforms prior to the handover, Zhang publicly feuded with Patten, and their dispute dominated news headlines in Hong Kong. Zhang accused Patten of violating the Sino-British agreement and called him \\"a prostitute who still wanted an arch to be erected to honour her as a chaste woman\\". == After Hong Kong == After attending the Hong Hong handover ceremony on 1 July 1997, Zhang returned to Hangzhou. He was appointed Party Secretary of Zhejiang University and oversaw the merger of Hangzhou University, Zhejiang Agricultural University and Zhejiang Medical University into ZJU. He hired the famous writer Jin Yong as president of ZJU's Institute of Humanities, and used his connections to solicit major donations from Hong Kong businesspeople such as Run Run Shaw and Tin Ka Ping. In 2005, a number of alumni and other donors established the \\"Junsheng Scholarship\\" in his honour to sponsor students from poor families. As of 2018, the scholarship had a fund of 30 million yuan and had supported more than 2,300 students. He also taught as a part-time professor at Sun Yat-sen University, Communication University of China, in addition to Zhejiang University. == Views on democracy == During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Zhang was sympathetic toward the pro-democracy students. He reportedly gave the go-ahead for the Wen Wei Po, Beijing's mouthpiece in Hong Kong, to publish an editorial with only four words: \\"deep grief\\" and \\"bitter hatred\\" after the government crackdown, but survived the ensuing purge of officials who supported political reform. On the other hand, Zhang was critical of the localism movement in Hong Kong. He said the localist activists were too young to understand the history of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, and advocated \\"national education\\" for students in Hong Kong. He dismissed the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement in 2014 and criticized its pro-democracy leaders for having \\"never done anything good for Hong Kong\\". == Death == On 19 February 2018, Zhang died in Hangzhou from cardiac arrest, at the age of 81. Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam expressed her sadness and praised Zhang's contributions to the establishment of the Hong Kong special administrative region. Chris Patten also gave his condolences. The South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's major English-language newspaper, published an editorial calling Zhang \\"a good friend\\" of Hong Kong who \\"always had the city’s best interests at heart\\". Pro-establishment Hong Kong lawmakers Chan Yuen-han and Tam Yiu-chung praised Zhang as \\"learned\\", \\"open to different perspectives\\", and principled, whereas Cheung Man-kwong, former lawmaker of the Democratic Party, said \\"Zhang, representing Beijing, made very stern criticisms against the pan-democrats.\\" == References == Category:1936 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Politicians from Longyan Category:Zhejiang University alumni Category:Zhejiang University faculty Category:Engineers from Fujian Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Fujian Category:Optical engineers Category:Sun Yat-sen University faculty Category:Communication University of China faculty Category:Chinese diplomats Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Fujian Category:Educators from Fujian ","title":"Zhang Junsheng"},{"id":"56716556","text":"During the 1929–30 Scottish football season, Celtic competed in the Scottish First Division. ==Results== ===Scottish First Division=== ===Scottish Cup=== ==References== Category:Celtic F.C. seasons Celtic ","title":"1929–30 Celtic F.C. season"},{"id":"56716574","text":"The 1931 Cal Aggies football team represented the Northern Branch of the College of AgricultureUniversity of California, Davis was known as Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture from 1922 to 1959. in the 1931 college football season.

Only seven years earlier, UH had been an all-white institution, not integrating until the 1962-63 academic year. \\"Blazing the Trail\\", by Robert D. Jacobus, in University of Houston magazine (Fall 2015) In 1971, less than three years after that Homecoming ceremony, she was found dead in the back of a stranger's car. Her death was believed to be a murder, and no one was ever found guilty for her death. A park at the university is named in her honor. == Personal life == Eusan was born on October 11, 1948 in Galveston County, Texas. Her parents, Ida Mae (Boudreaux) Eusan and Wilbur Thirkield Eusan, Sr., were working class. Eusan and her four siblings grew up in San Antonio, Texas. She graduated from Phillis Wheatley High School in 1966 and immediately enrolled at the University of Houston. == University of Houston == At the University of Houston, Eusan was involved in the Spirit of Houston marching band and worked as a reporter and photojournalist. She majored in education and journalism. She helped organize the Committee on Better Race Relations at UH, which aimed to \\"promote racial harmony among the students on the university’s campus.\\" One year later, Eusan co-founded African Americans for Black Liberation, which replaced to COBRR. That organization was started with hopes to bring together other races and surrounding communities, including the surrounding Third Ward neighborhood and nearby historically black university Texas Southern University. The group also fund raised for scholarships and created summer programs for black youth. Eusan was a charter member of the Epsilon Lamba chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first black sorority at the university. She also co-founded SHAPE (Self Help for African People through Education) Community Center in the Third Ward. On November 22, 1968, Eusan was crowned UH's second black Homecoming queen over five other white candidates in the Astrodome. The African Americans for Black Liberation ran her campaign. The Daily Cougar, the student newspaper, endorsed her candidacy. She continued to advocate for civil rights and black pride as Homecoming queen. In the weeks leading up to the Homecoming game, Eusan received death threats and white fraternities mocked her in minstrel shows. Through the mocking, Eusan stayed positive. In an interview with the Houston Chronicle two weeks later, Eusan said, \\"This was the first time black students on the campus have banded together and really been effective against overwhelming odds.\\" In February 1969, Eusan and 100 other members of the AABL marched to UH President Phillip G. Hoffman's office and presented a list of 10 demands, which included: * Creation of an African-American studies program * Hiring more black faculty and staff * Efforts to recruit and retain black students * Pay equity and better conditions for menial workers * Support for inner-city youth programs Hoffman agreed to some of the group's demands. The same year, the University started the African-American studies program the AABL requested. Twice, Eusan was arrested for demonstrating. In 1969, she was charged with destruction of public property for her role in a riot on the UH campus. The charges were later dropped. In 1967, she was arrested during a demonstration for better conditions for children in the Sunnyside neighborhood. == Murder == After graduating from UH in 1970, Eusan got a job reporting with Voice of Hope, the media arm of HOPE Development, Inc., in the Fifth Ward. She contributed to Black Enterprise magazine and worked as a secretary. Eusan planned to attend graduate school in North Carolina. The last time anyone saw Eusan was, she was waiting at a bus stop in windy, rainy weather on the evening of September 10, 1971. On September 10, 1971, a car driven by Leo Jackson, Jr. collided with a police vehicle. In the back seat, police found Eusan's body; she had been stabbed several times. Jackson claimed that Eusan had been \\"hysterical\\", assaulted him, and then stabbed herself, and that he was on his way to the hospital. Jackson had been arrested 14 times prior to the incident for charges including rape and armed robbery. Jackson was charged with Eusan's murder, but in 1972, a jury acquitted him. Since then, no one has been charged in connection with Eusan's death. == Legacy == Eusan was buried in the African American Cemetery on the east side of San Antonio. A public memorial service was held at UH. The sorority Eusan helped charter, Alpha Kappa Alpha, is still active at the university. The SHAPE Community Center is still active in the Third Ward. The center mobilized voters to elect Houston's first black mayor, organizes an annual Pan African Cultural Festival, and contributed to efforts to build the Third Ward Multi-Service Center. Three years after Eusan's death, the University of Houston Board of Regents named a park in her honor, called the Lynn Eusan Park. Until the 1980s, the park was home to the university's live mascot, a cougar named Shasta, who resided in a cage. In 2013, the university built a modern stage for the park equipped with lights and a sound system. The park is a hub of student life and activity at the university. == References == Category:1948 births Category:1971 deaths Category:American murder victims Category:University of Houston alumni ","title":"Lynn Eusan"},{"id":"56716642","text":"The Book of Swindles (Piàn jīng 騙經), also known by its longer title, A New Book for Foiling Swindlers, Based on Worldly Experience (Jiānghú lìlǎn dùpiàn xīnshū 江湖歷覽杜騙新書), is said to be the first Chinese short story collection about fraud.Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk, \\"Translators' Introduction,\\" in Zhang Yingyu, The Book of Swindles (Columbia, 2017), p. xiii. Written and compiled by Zhang Yingyu 張應俞, it was published in Fujian province in or around 1617, and most of its stories are set during the latter part of the Ming dynasty. To each story the author adds a commentary that in some cases offers a moral lesson and in some cases shows appreciation for the artistry of the swindler, often praising the cleverness of the con and blaming its victim. Modern editions have been entitled both The Book Against Swindles (Fangpian jing) and The Book of Swindles (Pian jing). A selected English translation, The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection, translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk, was published by Columbia University Press in 2017. == Background and themes == The first edition of 1617 has the full title A New Book for Foiling Swindlers, Based on Worldly Experience (Jianghu lilan dupian xinshu), suggesting that it is a guide to avoiding swindles and to negotiating the risky world of the traveling merchant, a life that an increasing number of people were leading in the growing commercial economy of the late Ming. It can just as well, however, be read as a guide to carrying out such scams oneself. == Types of swindle == The Book of Swindles is divided into twenty-four categories of swindle: == Author == Zhang Yingyu, style name Kui Zhong (夔衷), is an obscure figure. The Book of Swindles is the only known work to appear under his name, and no other records of him are known.

Ceton is best known as one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party, which later provided the core of the Communist Party of the Netherlands. ==Background== His father, Huijg Ceton, was descended from an English or Scottish soldier who had been stationed in Schoonhoven around 1620. His family were convinced they were descended from Huguenots and turned the name into 'Seton' or 'Ceton'. They traditionally worked as coppersmiths. His mother, Maria Sterk, came from a family of artisans and farmers. However Ceton's father broke with tradition becoming a teacher at the public primary school in Bodegraven. Ceton decided to follow his father into teaching. In September 1890 he enrolled as a student at the Dutch National School for Teachers in Haarlem. Although he was considered one of the best youngsters of his year he failed to get his teaching certificate as a primary school teacher in April 1894. In October he successfully retook the exams and started in January 1895 as a teacher at the public primary school in Alphen aan den Rijn. By studying in his spare time he gained full qualifications as of teacher in October 1898. Then on 1 June 1899 he was employed as a schoolteacher at School 130 Amsterdam, later Kastanjeplein school in Oosterparkbuurt. ==Approach to pedagogy== As a young teacher, Ceton opposed too strong an emphasis on book wisdom. He took the school children on long nature walks advocated this form of pedagogy during meetings of teachers from the Oude Rijn area. He wrote about butterflies for the magazine De Levende Natuur (Living Nature) of Eli Heimans, Jasper Jaspers and Jac. P. Thijsse. This interest nature led him to resist the existing form of Christian education, and more generally the social relations in society. The Calvinist dominance in the local area led the municipalities to marginalize public primary education. His friend, C. Bijkerk, a teacher in Oudshoorn and later an activist with the Social Democratic Workers' Party, publicly campaigned against this in the local magazine De Rijnbode, also exposing the deplorable social conditions of the working class. Ceton became departmental secretary of the Nederlandsch Onderwijzers Genootschap (Dutch Education Association). ==References== Category:1875 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Communist Party of the Netherlands politicians Category:Dutch educators Category:Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands) politicians Category:People from Bodegraven ","title":"Jan Ceton"},{"id":"56716686","text":"Ahtanum Creek is a tributary of the Yakima River in the U.S. state of Washington. It starts at the confluence of the Middle and North Forks of Ahtanum Creek near Tampico, flows along the north base of Ahtanum Ridge, ends at the Yakima River near Union Gap and forms a portion of the northern boundary of the Yakama Indian Reservation. The name Ahtanum originates from the Sahaptin language, which was spoken by Native Americans in the region. The North Fork enters the Middle Fork just upstream from its confluence with the South Fork. These three forks have sources in the Cascade Mountains. The creek has had several different official names since Europeans settled the region, all of which have been variant spellings of Ahtanum. The current spelling has been in place since 1916. Seasonal flooding associated with snow melting in the spring is common. ==History== Native Americans, including the Yakama Tribe inhabited the region surrounding Ahtanum Creek long before the arrival of Europeans. The band living along the creek, known as Ahtanumlema (″People of the water by the long hill″), were considered to be one of the more important groups within the tribe. St. Joseph's Mission.While the creek still lied within Oregon Territory, Catholic Fathers Louis D'herbomez and Charles Pandosy were sent to the area by François Norbert Blanchet, who was Bishop of the Archdiocese of Oregon City at the request of native leaders. Father Pandosy first served in missions near Richland and Ellensburg before constructing St. Joseph's Mission in 1852 with Father D'herbomez along Ahtanum Creek near what is now Tampico. This location was chosen because of its location within the main summer camp of Chief Kamiakin. The missionaries and Yakamas worked together to build the first irrigation canals in the area. The relationship between the two groups was such that Kamiakin and others brought their children to the mission to be baptized. In 1854, Father D'herbomez was replaced by Father Pierre-Paul Durieu who would compile a dictionary of the Sahaptin language. The original mission was burned down in 1855 during the Yakima War by U.S. soldiers who believed the missionaries were conspiring with the Yakama Tribe. The mission was rebuilt in 1867. Union Gap was established as Yakima City along Ahtanum Creek near its confluence with the Yakima River in the 1860s and became the county seat in 1870. In 1885, the Northern Pacific Railway established North Yakima (which later became Yakima) four miles north of present-day Union Gap because the railroad considered the then-current settlement to be too swampy and too close to nearby ridges. North Yakima was incorporated and became the county seat in 1886. A wildfire burned near the North Fork of Ahtanum Creek in 2009. ==Human use== Water is pulled from Ahtanum Creek to irrigate of land upstream of the gauge in Union Gap. Fishing is popular along the creek, with fly fishing, baitcasting, spinning all being successful. The upper portion of the creek's watershed lies within Ahtanum State Forest, which is managed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. The forest has an area of that has numerous campgrounds. Seasonal hunting and snowmobiling are also popular. ==Ecology== Being located in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range, Ahtanum Creek has a riparian zone that serves as an important habitat for animals living in the region. Endangered species that utilize the creek include steelhead trout, bull trout, Chinook salmon, and coho salmon. The Yakama Tribe completed a restoration project at La Salle High School. This project included strengthening three areas of the creek bank that were prone to erosion and reintroducing native plant species such as coyote willow. Along with this, two backwater channels were created and of soil were removed from the flood plain. These changes reconnected that stretch of the creek with its flood plain and provided areas for young fish to be reared. The North Yakima Conservation District installed fish screens on five water diversions between 2002 and 2006. ==See also== *Kamiakin's Gardens *St. Joseph's Mission ==References== Category:Yakima, Washington Category:Rivers of Washington (state) Category:Rivers of Yakima County, Washington Category:Yakima River ","title":"Ahtanum Creek"},{"id":"56716697","text":"Murray David Maitland Keddie (27 May 1929 – 18 February 2018), known as David Keddie, was a prominent Essex businessman, broadcaster, benefactor, magistrate, Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Essex in 1986.. ==Early life== Keddie was educated at Summer Fields School, Summertown, Oxford, and Malvern College (at that time housed with Harrow School, as Malvern College was requisitioned by TRE for World War II effort).

He died in 1903 under great pressure when Cheng was only ten years old. Cheng' s mother was a seamstress and also worked hard to ensure her son is able to go to school. However, severe economic conditions forced Cheng to quit school when he was 15 to help his mother raising his younger sister. Cheng moved to Suzhou with his family and his new bride in 1915 as he accepted a teaching position to teach Wu (the Shanghainese dialect).

Aside from long working hours, Cheng spent a lot of time reading Chinese classics, writing short stories and buying old books during his time in the watchmaker shop, which has crucially influenced his later literary career according to a biographer he was closed to. Cheng took night classes to learn English, which allowed him to read foreign novels by writers like Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant and Alexandre Dumas fils. Later, he came across Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in the Shi Wu Bao Newspaper, which inspired him to write detective stories of his own. Cheng Xiaoqing published his first detective story titled \\"The Shadow in the Lamplight\\" in The Merry Magazine in 1914. He later entered this piece in a Shanghai newspaper contest and won. == Later life == In 1946, Cheng became the editor of detective magazine The New Detective, but because of the lack of story sources, the magazine then shut down. After the publication was stopped, Cheng became a teacher working in The No.1 Middle School in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. Ten years later, Cheng began to write adventure fiction; for example, one of the most famous movies in 1958 called \\"The Case of Xu Qiuying\\" was created based on Cheng's fiction. However, during the period of Cultural Revolution, Cheng was criticized and denounced by the public, thus he had to stop writing. He died of stomach illness in 1976 when he was 83 years old. == Works and accomplishments == ===Literatures=== Cheng Xiaoqing is known as the \\"Grand Master of China's Detective Fiction\\" as well as the \\"Conan Doyle in Eastern World.\\" His first story \\"The Shadow in the Lamplight\\" (灯光人影) was published by Shanghai Newspaper when he was twenty-one years old and it was well received by its readership. Later, he started to publish more famous detective stories such as \\"Cat's Eye\\"; \\"The Shoe\\"; \\"The Other Paragraph\\"; \\"The Odd Tenant\\"; \\"The Examination Paper\\" and \\"On the Huangpu\\", which were all collected in the Huo Sang Series. Other detective works like \\"One Summer Night\\"; \\"At the Ball\\" and \\"The Ghost in the Villa\\" were published in different magazines. In addition, Cheng Xiaoqing also wrote detective novels such as The South-China Swallow (Jiang Nanyan) and Blood Fingerprint. ===Movies=== Cheng Xiaoqing's literary creation was famous in the 1920s, but main movie activities began in the 1930s. In 1926, his novel \\"The Heart of the Mother\\" was edited by Chen Zhiqing into a screenplay, which is his works' first entry into the movie. Then in 1931, Cheng Xiaoqing officially started writing scripts for major movie companies. It is clearly to be seen from the adaptation, Cheng Xiaoqing does not completely rewrite the novels; rather, he redesigned the plots based on film features and audience psychology in order to attract more viewers. == References == === Citations === === Sources === * Luo Xueyan. \\"程小青侦探小说创作心理初探\\".

Described by the author as a deeply personal experience, the book talks about her roots and how she found her voice, as well as her time in the White House, her public health campaign, and her role as a mother. The book is published by Crown and was released in 24 languages. One million copies were donated to First Book, an American nonprofit organization which provides books to children. It sold more copies than any other book published in the United States in 2018, breaking the record in just 15 days. ==Background== The memoir was published on November 12, 2018. According to an anonymous source reported by The Atlantic, Barack Obama has said Michelle had help from a ghostwriter. In 2020, The New York Times confirmed the book was written by a ghostwriter. ==Synopsis== The book's 24 chapters (plus a preface and epilogue) are divided into three sections: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More. The Preface of the book sets the stage for Michelle Obama's story to open by sketching a scene in her post-First Lady life. Becoming Me traces Obama's early life growing up on the South Side of Chicago with her parents - Fraser and Marian Robinson - in an upstairs apartment where she got her first piano lessons and learnt to be an independent girl under the nurturing care of her parents. There, Obama shared a bedroom with her brother Craig. The book continues through her education at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. While this section talks considerably at length about Obama's Princeton experience and Sidley Austin, Harvard Law school's experiences are mentioned marginally by comparison. Becoming Us departs from the beginning of the Obamas' romantic relationship and follows their marriage, and the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. The book shares Obama's balance between her position as the first African American First Lady of the United States of America, her motherly duties, and marital commitments. The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States. Becoming More takes the readers through Barack Obama's presidency, Michelle Obama's focus on her Let's Move campaign, and her role of \\"head mom in chief\\" to her two daughters - Malia and Sasha Obama, along with the other aspects of the Obama's life as first family. The Epilogue talks about the last day of Obamas in the White House which was also Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony and Michelle Obama's reflection on Optimism. She also expresses her lack of desire to ever run for office. ==Book sales== Total book sales, including hardcover, audio and e-books editions, sold around 725,000 copies in the United States and Canada during its first day, making it the second best-selling debut for any book in 2018. Bob Woodward's Fear: Trump in the White House holds the record after selling around 900,000 copies during its first day. However, Barnes and Noble reported that Becoming surpassed Fear in first-week sales and had more first-week sales of any adult book since Go Set a Watchman in 2015. The book sold 1.4 million copies in its first week. After 15 days, the book became the best-selling book in the US for the year 2018. By March 26, 2019, Becoming had sold 10 million copies. == Reception == The review aggregator website Book Marks reported that 18% of critics gave the book a \\"rave\\" review, while 73% of the critics expressed \\"positive\\" impressions, based on a sample of 22 reviews. It was an Oprah's Book Club 2.0 selection. The book was given over 42,000 ratings and over 41,000 reviews on Goodreads and received 4.55 out of 5 stars. Hannah Giogris, a writer from The Atlantic, used the words \\"refreshing\\" and \\"striking\\" to describe the book. The audiobook edition won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2020. == Soundtrack == American musician Questlove curated a soundtrack for the book, called The Michelle Obama Musiaqualogy. == Tour == In November 2018, Michelle Obama went on a national book tour conducted in arenas, often to sold-out crowds starting in Chicago at the United Center. Obama previewed the book and tour on Chicago's Windy City Live daytime television show at her alma mater Whitney M. Young Magnet High School on Chicago's Near West Side. The initial tour included 12 venues in 10 cities, but expanded with its popularity; as of February 2019, another 21 cities had been added, including six in Europe and four in Canada. ==Film== In May 2020, a documentary film based on the book was released on Netflix, following Obama through her book tour. The documentary features footage of Obama's travels behind-the-scenes of the tour and clips of her interviews onstage with moderators including Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Colbert. == References == == External links == * *Official website for Japan *Interview with Michelle Obama on Becoming, conducted by Oprah Winfrey, November 13, 2018, C-SPAN Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:American memoirs Category:Books by Michelle Obama Category:Crown Publishing Group books Category:Political memoirs ","title":"Becoming (book)"},{"id":"56717084","text":"Sara Grace Wallerstedt is an American fashion model.

Sodium sulfosuccinate esters are organic compounds with the formula NaO3SCH(CO2R')CH2CO2R where R and R' can be H or alkyl groups. They comprise a large class of surfactants and emulsifiers used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and cleaning agents. They are colorless salts. These materials can be further classified into monoesters (R' = H, R = alkyl) and diesters (R and R' = alkyl). ==Synthesis== They are produced by treatment of maleic anhydride with alcohols.

Athena with cross-banded aegis The statue was found in 1880 during Carl Humann's excavations of Pergamon in the space to the west of the north stoa of the sanctuary of Athena, near the Lady of Pergamon. This area may have been the art collection (museion) of the Attalid kings. When the statue was found, there were still traces of paint on it: the aegis had parts in light and dark blue, the snakes were red, and there were other bits of colour on the hem. These traces of colour can no longer be perceived, except for a painted band on the soles of her shoes. The statue is largely intact, except for the right arm and one fold of her drapery. The left arm has been reconstructed from a number of fragments. The head was only found several months after the body and was more heavily corroded than the rest of the statue. It was made separately and inserted into the main statue. The head was looted by the Russians and is now lost; a plaster cast sits in its place. Athena wears a girdled Doric peplos, which leaves her arms free and falls to her hips. Especially on the right hand side, it is characterised by elegant flowing folds. The unusual, cross- strapped form of the aegis is the source of the statue's common name. It is formed of two separate strips which run under the arms and cross in front of the bosom and in the same space at the back. These strips are probably meant to imitate the design of furs. On the lower edge of the strips of the aegis there are small curves, from which small serpents emerge. These are partially carved in free relief, and are shown winding around themselves, tying themselves into knots, and striking out. Where the aegis crosses, there is a Gorgoneion, which turns away evil, depicted as a brooch. Her hair falls in gentle locks. It is tied back from the face and held in a bun at the back of the head. From the surviving top portion of the missing right arm, it is clear that it must have been bent. Since the head is also turned slightly to the right and downwards, it has been suggested that the goddess held a small Nike or a lance in her hand. Her left hand might have held a lance or perhaps a helmet (vehemently denied by many archaeologists). The statue follows classical models of around 430/20 BC, but it was actually made in the Hellenistic period, around 150 BC, and lacks the self-centred harmony and calm of its models. The posture of the head and right arm in connection with the placement of the weight-bearing right leg further to the rear suggest a jerky movement. The left leg is bent, with the knee extending further forward. The way her clothing sits also suggests a tense restlessness. In composition and execution, the statue blends the classical model with the new ideas of the Hellenistic age. Aspects of her clothing seem to derive from the Great frieze of the Pergamon altar. There is also a connection to the Statue of Athena, which Myron made on Samos and which many archaeologists have wished to see this as a copy of. == Bibliography== * John Boardman: Griechische Plastik.

Lotus tenellus is included in a more broadly circumscribed L. glaucus by some authors, which extends its distribution to the Canary Islands. ==Description== Lotus glaucus is a perennial herbaceous plant, usually forming dense mats, but sometimes somewhat shrubby. The leaves are unstalked (sessile) with five pinnate leaflets. In L. glaucus subsp. glaucus, the two basal leaflets are 1.5–4.5 mm long; a short axis (rhachis), up to 2 mm long, separates the basal leaflets from the other three leaflets, which are 2–8 mm long, longer than the basal leaflets. The leaflets of L. glaucus subsp. salvagensis are generally longer, up to 13 mm. The stems and leaves have straight hairs which lie flat along the surface. The density of these hairs varies; some plants have dense hairs and appear silvery, others have fewer hairs and are greener. The flowers are arranged in umbels, usually with one to three flowers per umbel, occasionally up to five. The petals are initially orange to reddish, sometimes deep yellow, turning reddish-brown after fertilization. The upper petal (the standard) is shorter than or as long as the keel petals, which are 10–15 mm long. The wing petals are 9–14 mm long, usually shorter than the keel. The fruit pods are straight. ==Taxonomy== Lotus glaucus was first described in volume 3 of the first edition of Hortus Kewensis, dated to 1789. The title page gives the author of the work as William Aiton, although it is generally agreed that the descriptions were written by Daniel Solander or Jonas Carlsson Dryander. Some sources ascribe the name Lotus glaucus to Solander or to Dryander. However, the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, at Article 46.8, Example 37, explicitly states that the names in this edition of Hortus Kewensis are to be attributed to Aiton. Lotus glaucus is placed in Lotus section Pedrosia, sometimes recognized as a subgenus or as a separate genus. The taxonomy of the species placed in this section is described as \\"problematic\\". L. glaucus belongs to a group that can be divided into different numbers of species. In 2006, Sandral et al. accepted three species – L. glaucus, L. tenellus and L. dumetorum – while noting that it was equally possible to treat L. glaucus as including the other two species. Other sources accept two species, sinking L. tenellus into L. glaucus, but recognizing L. dumetorum. ===Subspecies=== Sandral et al. recognize two subspecies: *Lotus glaucus subsp. glaucus – Madeira; peduncles usually three to four times as long as the subtending leaves *Lotus glaucus subsp. salvagensis – Salvage Islands; penduncles at most as long as the subtending leaves; leaflets usually larger They also examined specimens from Fuerteventura, which may belong to the same species, possibly as an additional subspecies. However, they noted that \\"it is difficult to make a precise decision on its taxonomic identity\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Lotus glaucus sensu stricto is native to Madeira (subsp. glaucus) and the Salvage or Savage Islands (subsp. salvagensis), and possibly also Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands if specimens collected from there belong to this species. When L. tenellus is included in L. glaucus, its distribution is extended to the coastal zone of Tenerife and Gran Canaria. ==References== glaucus Category:Flora of Madeira Category:Flora of the Savage Islands ","title":"Lotus glaucus"},{"id":"56717241","text":"Good Epidemiological Practices or Good Epidemiology Practices (GEP) was a set of guidelines produced by the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) in 1991 to improve epidemiologic research practices. It was then adopted by the tobacco industry around 1993 as part of its \\"sound science\\" program to counter criticisms of the industry on health and environmental issues such as secondhand smoke. It failed to make much impact on the US and European regulators, but may have had more influence in its later manifestations in Asia and particularly China. The complexities of creating Good Epidemiological Practices developments have been examined by University of San Francisco researchers Stanton Glantz and Elisa K. Ong in papers such as \\"Tobacco Industry Efforts to Subvert the IARC's Second hand smoke study\\" published in The Lancet. They argued that these were industry programs designed to manipulate the scientific standards of proof, and an attempt to set risk- evaluation standards that could be forced through by legislation, and imposed on the agencies (EPA, OSHA, etc.) to hamstring the agencies' ability to regulate. ==Tobacco's GEP== In February 1993, an executive of Philip Morris USA, Ellen Merlo, wrote a memo to her CEO William Campbell outlining their strategies to discredit the 1992 report by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that identified secondhand smoke as a Group A human carcinogen, and to counter what she described as \\"junk science\\". Their public relations firm, APCO Associates, launched a \\"sound science\\" coalition in the United States, and The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC) was formed three months later in May 1993, with Garrey Carruthers the chairman. George L. Carlo, a science entrepreneur who worked with Federal Focus Inc., prepared one of the early draft documents. At this time the legislative and public activist attacks on the tobacco industry had escalated, and they blamed this on the \\"twisted science\\" used by the EPA. In Europe the UN's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) was about to release a similar report, which the tobacco industry also needed to counter. Helmut Reif, Tom Borelli and Mitch Ritter at Philip Morris's Science & Technology division thought the CMA's GEP could be improved to help PM develop standards for secondhand smoke epidemiological studies. This initiative to \\"constructively improve\\" epidemiology would enlist the assistance of the industry's consultants, and they could then run an \\"offensive strategy\\"—essentially another proactive effort by the industry to shape the scientific process. Joanna Sullivan, Philip Morris's main PR in Europe, advised her American superiors (June 1994) on how GEP might be used to combat the IARC's report, since this would give United Nations weight to the claim that second-hand smoke was potentially cancerous to non-smokers. By establishing the standards of epidemiology and by using their influence in Congress to have GEP mandated by legislation, they hoped to design a set of established procedural standards for epidemiology. The innovation here, was that they aimed to attack the techniques relied on by the EPA and IARC scientists. In the past, they had focussed attacks on specific adverse scientific findings and reports. GEP was designed to directed an attack on the techniques of epidemiology itself. They may have had little hope that this would be widely accepted by the majority of epidemiologists or by the regulators, but it made possible a vigorous public relations campaign in the media to challenge and denigrate any adverse findings. ===Panels and Conferences=== Initially Philip Morris utilised a small panel of trusted epidemiologists who regularly serviced the industry when it needed to defend against some adverse finding. They were requested to improve on the Chemical Manufacturer's Association's GEP. Later they extended this mandate by conducting seminars on GEP and good risk-assessment practice around the world. The tobacco industry itself needed to remain invisible and so they needed the front provided by third-party think-tanks and old allies. The main organisation hired to run the GEP program was Federal Focus Inc., a PR company set up during the second term of the Reagan Administration by two top Agency officials, Thorne Auchter, who had been the Director of the OSHA (Occupational Safety & Health Administration) and James J. Tozzi who had been Reagan's \\"Deregulation Czar\\" as head of the OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs), at the OMB (Office of Management & Budget). These two and the head of the EPA (Anne Gorsuch Burford) were among the 20 or so top Agency executives forced (or encouraged) to resign over Reagan's regulatory scandals. Jim Tozzi's technique at the OIRA was to block regulators from regulating by denying their agencies funding unless they cancelled one regulation before adding another. (Tozzi and Auchter also ran Multinational Business Services, and the Institute for Regulatory Policy). The main tobacco law firm, Covington & Burling (C&B;) was also involved both in promoting the idea and in recruiting scientists willing to participate, usually only when assured that payment would be laundered through the law firm. C&B; lawyer John Rupp initiated similar activities in Italy and Germany. The total expenses for this program in 1997 were about $300,000. The GEP program \\"experts\\" that Auchter and Tozzi enlisted were pre-screened by Philip Morris Issues Managers and Federal Focus, and the results they produced were pre-tested at a number of conferences (which often didn't carry the GEP name). The first, known as the Lansdowne Conference, was held at a US conference center with only a few of their most trusted scientist helpers. They then widened the advisory pool and held a London Conference where Philip Morris opened the operation to British- American Tobacco and the other companies. They established what became known as the London Principles. A German conference soon followed. Generally GEP failed to influence policy makers in America and Europe, so it was tried in Asia through conferences of the Asian WhiteCoats group (collectively known as 'ARTIST') and with other recruits in Kuala Lumpur, Hong-Kong, Yokohama, Beijing, and then Guangzhou. ===The inadvertent whistleblower=== Ted Sanders, who ran the Scientific Affairs operations for Philip Morris in Europe, provides us with an excellent overview of how the Philip Morris GEP unravelled in a long letter of complaint to Cathy Ellis, his executive overseer in Brussels (Apr 3 1998). ==References== Category:Epidemiology Category:Tobacco industry Category:Politics and technology Category:Environmental law in the United States ","title":"Good Epidemiological Practices"},{"id":"56717276","text":"Sara Negri (born January 21, 1967) is a mathematical logician who studies proof theory.

It premiered on 24 August 2020 on Star Plus. It stars Rajshree Thakur, Manav Gohil and Rati Pandey. == Plot == The story revolves around a mature couple, Preeti Jindal and Keertan Tibrewal (K.T.), business partners, and wedding planners in a marriage bureau named \\"Shaadi Mubarak.\\" While Preeti is a widow, Keertan's marriage is trouble. The story revolves around these two individuals who are completely different from each other but nicely complement each other. Thus begins a unique tale of self-respect, friendship and love. Preeti organizes her son Tarun's wedding single-handedly during the COVID-19 pandemic with necessary precautions for it. Later in the party, when Rajasthani film industry ex-film star Keertan Tibrewal aka K.T., arrives, he takes all the limelight. On the other hand, Preeti, who sacrificed her voice for her son as she took an oath when Tarun was just seven years to cure him and promised to break her silence when Tarun gets married, breaks it. Keertan decides to gift his mother a new almirah and sets his eyes on one commissioned by Preeti. Later, Preeti faces a miserable condition and decides to sell the almirah that she bought for Tarun to Keertan as Tarun wants a car. At the same time, Tarun and Rati find themselves under pressure to pay the car's full amount in a day as his pre-booking would be canceled, and the advanced money will be taken. While Rati and Tarun meet her boss, Rati steals their boss Chanda's expensive diamond ring, and Preeti is accused of the theft. Despite knowing it, to save their jobs, Preeti takes the humiliation but later confronts the two over her insult. Tarun ousts Preeti from the house, and Juhi brings Preeti to stay at her in-laws. While Kusum is initially reluctant to let Preeti stay, the two soon form a friendship. In Preeti's absence, Rati complained to Tarun about doing the household chores. Keertan meets Chanda at his residence who tries to get intimate with him. Chanda vents out her anger on Keertan for not accepting her. It is also revealed that Keertan's wife left him and ran away with her lover two years after their marriage. An emotional Keertan storms out of the house. Preeti and Kusum get a surprise grand celebration for Mother's Day from their kids. Preeti opens up about wanting to start a job and earn money and respect. Preeti decides to work in a marriage bureau. Kusum and her family help Preeti create a CV to attend interviews but has a hard time finding a job because of her age. Keertan comes to Kusum's house and asks Preeti to become his business partner. Preeti says she needs more time to think, and after Tarun and Rati's hurtful comments, Preeti resolves to work independently. However, after certain circumstances she agrees to work with him. Tarun surprises Rati by gifting her a brand new car. Elsewhere, Preeti and Keertan gear up for the inauguration of their new office. Preeti and her family arrive at the new office, but Keertan's mom doesn't like that she is a middle-class woman. Later, during the puja, Preeti Keertan chooses the name for their company \\"Shaadi Mubarak\\". Preeti receives a warning from Neelima for partnering up with Keertan for the new venture. Keertan tells Preeti that he didn't do anything without making a plan, but Preeti is still worried. Keertan comes late to work, and Preeti is worried when no one else is there besides the two of them. On the other hand, Tarun is left speechless after learning about a new employee in his office, none other than Priyanka. Keertan gets a surprise visit from Rati as she is looking for a job better than the one given by Chanda. Rati is left speechless after seeing that Shaadi Mubarak's co-owner is Preeti and insults her but gets humiliated after being unable to answer Preeti's questions. While Keertan trusts Preeti with his debit card she is told to give the advertisement company money as Keertan has promised he would give the next day. Preeti goes to the ATM but accidentally takes to much out. She gets accused of theft as Keertan does not remember giving Preeti his card leaving her upset. When Neelima talks about Preeti, Keertan realizes his mistake and apologizes to her. Elsewhere, an angry Priyanka lashes out at Juhi as she knew that she loved Tarun. When Preeti reaches Kusum's house, she finds that her in-laws are back with Tarun and Rati. Tarun again humiliates and disrespects Preeti, but she justifies her purpose for working with Keertan. Kusum takes a stand for Preeti and scolds Tarun. He is left with no choice and issues a challenge to Preeti. She refuses to accept his challenge but agrees after Tarun says that he will never talk again if she doesn't accept. Preeti and Keertan get many phone calls after their advertisement got released and are in for a major surprise as the business tycoon, Mr. Nathmal, contacts them for his daughter's wedding. When they reach his place, they meet up with Rati, but Mr. Nathmal tells her to leave as Chanda didn't show up for the project who, in turn, rebukes Rati for failing to convince him. Keertan and Preeti discuss the wedding plans for Mr. Nathmal's daughter's wedding. Rati complains to Tarun that Preeti dealt with Mr. Nathmal and Chanda yelled at her because of Preeti. Rati asks Tarun to \\"love\\" Priyanka so she could give all the information about Shaadi Mubarak so that Rati won't get fired from her job. Preeti and Juhi make preparations for Amit's arrival. Preeti video calls Kusum and sneakily shows her Priyanka and Amit talking to each other. When Preeti and Kusum talk about marriage, Preeti lies about how much her husband loved her while, in reality, he mistreated and hated her. Kusum's, on the other hand, was a love marriage, and they eloped. Priyanka and Amit's marriage is confirmed, and everyone celebrates. Priyanka gets a message from Tarun saying that he feels terrible about what he did at the office the other day. Preeti and Keertan start to talk about love, but some of their wounds get opened. Keertan and Preeti's memories become harsh, and Preeti runs off. Keertan gets this feeling that \\"love\\" has also hurt Preeti. After getting some strength, Preeti goes back and continues with the topic of \\"love.\\" After Kusum explains love to them, Preeti gets an idea for Mr. Nathmal's daughter's wedding. Meanwhile Tarun pretends to be nice to Priyanka. Preeti and Keertan design a presentation with their ideas on the computer. However, when they arrive at Mr. Nathmal's house they discover the computer isn't turning on. Chanda comes in with Rati who present K.T. and Preeti's idea. Preeti confronts Chanda while Rati insults Preeti but, Keertan stands up for her. Mr. Nathmal gives the deal to Chanda. Keertan realises someone fiddled with the computer and decides to find the culprit. Rati surprises Tarun with a celebration for his work. It is revealed the Priyanka is the one who got onto the computer and deleted the presentation because Tarun asked her to do so. It is also shown that Rati doesn't care about Tarun and is making him do all the work to bring Preeti back home and make her do all the household chores. Keertan brings in a technician to fix the computer and learns the software was deleted. Preeti scans through the keyboard and finds a broken fake nail stuck in the keys. She shows it to Keertan, and they find out that this person has stolen the idea was wearing fake nails. Neelima tells K.T. that maybe Preeti is the one who leaked the information to Chanda, but K.T. disagrees. Preeti shows the broken nail to Juhi who recognises the nail as Priyanka's but the latter changes her nails after overhearing their conversation. Keertan and Preeti meet their new client, Mrs. Goplani while Priyanka visits Tarun. Tarun proposes to Priyanka, but she refuses as Tarun is already married, and she is about to be married as well. Keertan and Preeti arrive at Mrs. Goplani's where K.T. decides to wait for their delivery and Preeti goes inside to speak with Mrs. Goplani. However Preeti is insulted due to her complexion leaving her shattered. She tells Kusum about her problem. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Rajshree Thakur as Preeti Jindal: Juhi and Tarun's mother.

Second-Generation DNA sequencing has enabled cost effective, high throughput and unbiased analysis of the transcriptome. Normally, RNA-seq is only capable of capturing a snapshot of the transcriptome at the time of sample collection. This necessitates multiple samplings at multiple time points, which increases both monetary and time costs for experiments. Methodological and technological innovations have allowed for the analysis of the RNA transcriptome over time without requiring multiple samplings at various time points. == Background == While DNA encodes all of the functional elements of life, the information encoded must be converted into functional form. Following the central dogma of molecular biology, messenger RNA encodes genetic information for producing proteins, which, alongside functional RNA carry out the majority of cellular processes required for life. Changes in RNA abundance may be used as a measurement of changes in cellular behavior, such as heat stress, infection by virus, or oncogenesis. Knowledge of how the transcriptome changes during cellular processes allows for greater understanding of the exact mechanisms underlying these processes. Originally, transcriptome-wide RNA abundance could only be assessed using methods such as DNA microarrays or serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). These methods are prohibitive in differing regards; microarrays, while cheap, provide inconsistent results and SAGE is based on sanger sequencing, which provides limited throughput. Using second generation sequencing, instead of measuring relative hybridization of sequences to probes in the case of microarrays or sequencing short segments in the case of SAGE, a researcher can simply sequence the bulk RNA within a sample and measure relative abundances of specific types of RNA by comparing the number of times each RNA molecule was sequenced in a given sample. Normally, in a traditional RNA-seq, microarray, or SAGE experiment RNA is extracted from a biological sample such as cultured cells, and the RNA is analyzed using the chosen method. The data obtained from such an experiment corresponds to abundance of RNA under the given experimental conditions at the time of harvest. For many applications, such as comparing the abundance of mRNA molecules between cells exposed to a drug and those not exposed to the drug, this type of experimental approach is sufficient. However, many cellular processes of scientific and medical interest are processes which occur over time, such as cellular differentiation or phagocytosis. Studying such processes requires analysis of RNA abundance across a series of time points. == Methods == Comparison of Time Resolved RNA- seq methods. Time series samples requires samples from both before and after all-time points, as well as sequencing of all biological samples separately. Affinity purification reduces the number of biological samples required, but increases the number of sequencing runs required. Nucleotide conversion requires the fewest biological samples and sequencing runs overall. h = hours. === Time series samples === ==== Sample preparation and data processing ==== The simplest approach towards assessing RNA abundance over time is to simply use multiple samples which are treated in exactly the same way, except for the duration of treatment. For example, to investigate a biological process which is estimated to occur for an hour, a researcher might design an experiment where the process is triggered for five minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, one hour, and two hours in separate cell culture samples before harvesting the cells for RNA-seq analysis. The researcher would then have measurements of the transcriptome at each of these time points, and comparing between these samples would indicate which cellular processes are activated and deactivated over time. ==== Strengths ==== This method is the most common for measurement of RNA over time in cell culture models, mainly due to its simplicity. Each biological sample need only be processed in exactly the same way, and the factor of time is easily adjusted in most experimental protocols. Furthermore, since each time point is its own sample, more RNA can be harvested and sequenced for a study. ==== Weaknesses ==== The requirement of multiple samples for time-resolved data collection increases the cost of the experiment as well as introducing a greater potential for technical errors. While the price of massively parallel sequencing has decreased greatly since its introduction, it is still prohibitively expensive for many laboratories to conduct large scale RNA-seq studies. This issue is compounded by additional time points increasing the number of samples by a multiple of the number of time points; using two time points rather than one doubles the number of samples required in an experiment. Consequently, many studies which use time series RNA-seq become limited in either their sample size, which reduces statistical power, or the number of time points, which reduces their time resolution, or both. Finally, by requiring a greater number of biological samples, there is greater risk for human error to affect the results, which may lead to spurious conclusions === Affinity Purification === Comparison of metabolic labelling workflows. ==== Sample preparation and data processing ==== In this approach, cell culture samples are cultured with tagged nucleotides which allow for selective purification of newly synthesized RNA molecules. One popular approach is pulse labeling with 4-thiouridine (4-sU), a uracil analogue that is incorporated in newly synthesized RNA molecules. In this type of experiment, a researcher would supplement cells with 4-sU at the time of the experiment or shortly beforehand. When the experimental treatment presumably affects RNA expression, newly synthesized RNA would be labeled with 4-sU. Newly synthesized RNA is labeled with a reactive thiol group, making it possible to link useful molecules to the RNA. Biotin is a popular molecule for use in this type of assay, as it is inexpensive and binds incredibly strongly and selectively to streptavidin. Incubation of biotinylated RNA with beads containing streptavidin allows for the selective purification of newly synthesized RNA. From here, newly synthesized and total RNA are sequenced separately and compared for differences. ==== Strengths ==== Affinity purification makes use of the incredibly popular biotin-streptavidin system for fractionation of biological materials. Binding of biotin to streptavidin is incredibly strong (Kd < 10−14 mol/L). It is also highly specific, which results in minimal background signal from non-specific binding events. Furthermore, time resolution is obtained in a single biological sample, resulting in reduced biological variability compared to using separate samples for each time point. ==== Weaknesses ==== The weaknesses of this method are mainly centered around efficiency. One major difficulty is uptake of 4-sU into cultured cells. If 4-sU is given too early, then it will be incorporated into RNA that was not synthesized before the cell began responding to the experimental conditions. If it is given too late, then early stages of the cellular response are not captured by the experiment. The rate of uptake of 4-sU can be measured, but this requires additional experiments to determine optimal dosage and time. Furthermore, these parameters need to be measured in the specific cell lines of interest, as different cell lines may take up 4-sU more slowly than others. RNA is known to be prone to degradation in vitro. It is common for experimental protocols involving RNA to include a number of steps to reduce chances of Ribonuclease contamination or spontaneous degradation of samples, as RNA quality affects RNA-seq results. Metabolic labeling involves a number of additional steps that must be performed in the laboratory on RNA that is in solution. Since metabolic labeling requires that the RNA be kept unfrozen in liquid solution, some level of spontaneous degradation is unavoidable, although it is usually not to such an extent that results are affected. Of greater risk is the chances of ribonuclease contamination, which would render a sample useless, wasting time and resources. It is important for researchers working with RNA in any capacity to minimize unnecessary handling of RNA due to these risks. One additional drawback of using this method is, given equivalent sample size, more sequencing runs are required compared to a time-series experiment. This is because multiple RNA samples corresponding to the initial time point must be sequenced. Research suggests that 4-sU labeling may result in transcriptional changes on its own, which would affect any results obtained using this method. === Nucleotide Conversion === ==== Sample preparation and data processing ==== Nucleotide conversion works by converting some nucleotides in newly synthesized RNA into others, which can be detected through sequencing. Timelapse-seq is an example of such an approach. As in affinity purification, cells are incubated with 4-sU. After extraction of RNA from samples, they are treated with 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine and sodium periodate, which converts 4-sU into trifluoroethyl cytosine, a cytosine analogue that is sequenced as a cytosine nucleotide instead of uracil. During sequence alignment and data processing, the U-to-C conversions are used to quantify the number of transcripts that are newly synthesized compared to bulk RNA. ==== Strengths ==== This method shares many strengths with affinity purification; notably the fact that multiple samples are not required for a time-series. This method eliminates the need for multiple sequencing runs for multiple time points, as all RNA is run together on the sequencing instrument and labeled RNA is separated from nonlabeled in silico. This reduces sequencing costs significantly, as now time resolution may be obtained without the need for additional samples or additional sequencing runs. Furthermore, by sequencing multiple time points together, technical variability introduced by sample processing is further reduced in addition to the reduced biological variability provided through the 4-sU experimental strategy. ==== Weaknesses ==== As with strengths, this method shares many weaknesses with affinity purification methods. Notably, 4-sU uptake and increased sample handling. Since Timelapse-seq relies upon synthetic chemistry methods to convert nucleotides, incomplete reactions result in an underestimation of the abundance of newly synthesized RNA and may result in variability between samples. === Nascent Transcript Sequencing === ==== Sample preparation and data processing ==== Unlike metabolic labeling, nascent transcript sequencing (NET-seq) directly sequences transcripts that are still undergoing transcription by RNA polymerase II. This method allows for the study of the dynamics of transcription elongation, which is not possible with metabolic labeling techniques. For a NET-seq experiment, cells are treated as with a standard RNA-seq experiment until they are lysed. Lysis is performed such that RNA-protein complexes remain intact, and RNA polymerase II is immunoprecipitated from the lysate. RNA that was undergoing transcription from DNA is still attached to RNA polymerase and is subsequently eluted from the polymerase and sequenced. ==== Strengths ==== Since NET-seq extracts transcripts that have not completed transcription, it is possible to obtain single-nucleotide resolution on the most recently synthesized nucleotide of transcripts. This is valuable in the study of phenomena such as transcriptional kinetics. Furthermore, it allows for the study of unstable transcripts which are degraded shortly after transcription. The general approach of immunoprecipitating RNA-binding proteins has great utility in understanding other areas of RNA biology, such as splicing. ==== Weaknesses ==== This method relies upon immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase II. There are a number of issues with immunoprecipitation, including non-specific binding interactions which may result in the immunoprecipitation of off-target RNA molecules. The temporal resolution of NET-seq is limited to transcription elongation. While comparing relative abundances between transcripts using NET- seq is possible, it is not the intention of the method. == Future Directions == Aside from time-series sampling, there are currently no methods for comparing more than two time points. Metabolic labeling experiments are only capable of comparing RNA abundances before and after pulse-labeling. It is of interest to be able to observe modifications to the transcriptome over a series of time points in a single sample, as this would provide increased time resolution in studies. Existing methods of metabolic labeling are of interest for this; if multiple different metabolic labels were used at differing time points this may allow for intermediate time points to be investigated. However, such approaches must be developed with care, as biases in labeling methods and sample processing steps could contribute to misleading results if data from different methods are compared to one another. Metabolic labeling with 4-sU has been reported to affect cellular phenotype. In current practice, this is unavoidable and is tolerated as the obtained data still fit current biological models, as well as the fact that 4-sU samples are compared with 4-sU samples in most cases. However, this has the potential to result in spurious conclusions, especially if there is any interaction between the effect of 4-sU and the chosen experimental condition. It is not possible to distinguish differences in RNA levels as being due to the experimental conditions being studied or being the result of 4-sU treatment. Identification of labeling chemicals that do not affect cellular phenotype would eliminate these issues altogether. == References == Category:DNA Category:DNA sequencing methods ","title":"Time-resolved RNA sequencing"},{"id":"56717368","text":"Sergey Prokopyev may refer to: *Sergey Prokopyev (cosmonaut), *Sergey Prokopyev (Volleyball Player) ","title":"Sergey Prokopyev"},{"id":"56717423","text":"Take No Prisoners is the 11th full-length album by R&B;/soul singer-songwriter Peabo Bryson, released in June 1985.

In 1925, he left Suriname for the Netherlands to study at the grammar school and later Leiden University, and continued his studies in Paris. In 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, and because Pos was Jewish, he tried to escape. His second attempt was successful and Pos managed to reach California via Finland, Russia and Japan. He then decided to go to the United Kingdom to enlist in the army. In 1944, Pos joined the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, and prosecuted \\"minor war crimes\\" for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Japan. Pos was back in the Netherlands in 1948, however he decided to return to his native country of Suriname in 1950 where he was appointed as judge and attorney general. Pos also taught at the Law School in Paramaribo. Eddy Hoost, the first Minister of Justice of an independent Suriname, asked Pos to return to Suriname to head the Constitutional Court of Suriname. Pos accepted the offer, however the court was not established until 4 October 2019. Pos started to publish under his own name after his retirement . ==Writer and Poet== He wrote poems under the pseudonym \\"Ernesto Albin\\" in the magazine Soela (1963-1964) and a number of plays, including the self-directed Vive la Vida (1957) and radio play Black and White. He published several collections of quatrains, which were later collected in Een uitroep zonder uitroepteken' (\\"an exclamation without exclamation mark\\") (1987) and various other collections. In his 1982 play De Tranen van Den Uyl (English: The Tears of Den Uyl), Pos writes about the December murders. Harold Riedewald, and Eddy Hoost were not just former students of Pos during the time he was teaching at the Law School in Suriname, but also personal friends. The play is about a fictitious meeting between the Surinamese reporter Jozef Slagveer and his Dutch counterpart Han de Graaf, in which the events after the independence of Suriname are discussed. Pos did not write the play as a drama, but as a means of remembrance. Even though he lived in diaspora, he mentally remained in his land of birth. In his first collection of stories Het doosje van Toeti (\\"The box of Toeti\\") (1985), he looks back on his childhood years in Paramaribo and his crossing to Holland. The stories from his second collection, De ziekte van Anna Printemps (\\"The Disease of Anna Printemps\\") (1987) take place everywhere around the globe. This cosmopolitanism can also be found in the collection of essays and travel reports that appeared on the occasion of his 74th birthday, Reizen en stilstaan (\\"Travel and residence\\") (1988), in which he also reflects on the moral implications of the judgments he had to express as a representative of the colonial authority over colonized people. ==Notes== ==Sources== * Bert Peene, 'Hugo Pos'.
