It shows changes in fluid pressure, temperature, entropy, flow rate etc.) with the compressor operating at different speeds. A compressor increases the pressure of a fluid passing through it, so that the exit pressure is higher than the inlet pressure. Due to this property, compressors are used in a wide range of machines, such as refrigerators, cars, jet engines and industrial processes. Compressor characteristic curves are plotted between various parameters and some are as follows ==Pressure ratio vs. non-dimensional flow rate== Performance of a compressor is usually specified by curves of delivery pressure against mass flow rate for various fixed values of rotational speed and inlet temperature.Klassen, H.A., \`Performance of low pressure ratio centrifugal compressors with four diffuser designs\`, NACA, TN 7237, March 1973.Nahimo, T. Et al., \`Effect of Reynolds number on performance characteristics of centrifugal compressors with special reference to configurations of impellers\`, ASME paper No.74-GT-59, 1974.Yahya ,S.M, ‚ÄùTurbine, Compressors & Fans‚Äù,4TH ED.McGraw Hill,2011. These performance characteristic curves are usually plotted with dimensionless variables. For this, we start with implicit functional relationships for all the variables as F (D, N, \\\\dot{m}, p_{01}, p_{02}, RT_{01}, RT_{02}) = 0 Horlock, J.H., Axial Flow Turbines, Kruger Publishing Co., 1973.Horlock, J.H., Axial Flow Compressors, Kruger Publishing Co., 1973. Where D = characteristic linear dimension of the compressor N = rotational speed \\\\dot{m} = mass flow rate p_{01} and p_{02} = stagnation pressure at compressor inlet and outlet T_{01} and T_{02} = stagnation temperature at compressor inlet and outlet R = characteristics gas constant By making use of œÄ-theorem, we obtain the non-dimensional groups (œÄ terms) as \\\\frac { p_{02} } { p_{01} }\\\\ , \\\\frac { T_{01} } { T_{02} }\\\\ , \\\\frac {{\\\\dot{m}} {\\\\sqrt {RT_{01}}}} {{D^2} {p_{01}} }\\\\ , \\\\frac {{N} {D}} {\\\\sqrt {RT_{01}}}\\\\ When we are concerned with the performance of a machine of fixed size compressing a specified gas and D may be omitted from the groups and we can write F \\\\left( \\\\frac { p_{02} } { p_{01} }\\\\ , \\\\frac { T_{01} } { T_{02} }\\\\ , \\\\frac {{\\\\dot{m}} {\\\\sqrt {T_{01}}}} { p_{01} }\\\\ , \\\\frac { N } {\\\\sqrt {T_{01}}}\\\\ \\\\right) = 0 Figure 1. Pressure ratio vs.Non-dimensional mass flow Though the terms \\\\frac {{\\\\dot{m}} {\\\\sqrt {T_{01}}}} { p_{01} }\\\\ and \\\\frac { N } {\\\\sqrt {T_{01}}}\\\\ are truly not dimensionless, they are referred as 'non-dimensional mass flow' and 'non-dimensional rotational speed' for practical purpose. The stagnation pressure ratio \\\\frac { p_{02} } { p_{01} }\\\\ is plotted against\\\\frac {{\\\\dot{m}} {\\\\sqrt {T_{01}}}} { p_{01} }\\\\ in the form of family of curves, each curve of a family being drawn for fixed values of \\\\frac { N } {\\\\sqrt {T_{01}}}\\\\ as shown in Figure 1. ==Pressure rise vs. flow rate== The plot between pressure rise and flow rate is same as pressure ratio vs. mass flow rate with a small difference as in here we take pressure difference between inlet and outlet of the compressor instead of their ratio. {\\\\Delta p = f(Q)}\\\\ {\\\\Delta p = f(\\\\dot{m})}\\\\ ==Loading coefficient/pressure coefficient vs. flow coefficient== First we have to know about the loading, pressure and flow coefficient which are as follow- Loading coefficient ~ {\\\\Psi^\\\\prime} = \\\\frac {{g} {h}} {u^2}\\\\ Pressure coefficient ~ {\\\\Psi} = \\\\frac {p_{02} - p_{01}} {{\\\\rho} {u^2}}\\\\ So we can see that {\\\\Psi} ~ {\\\\alpha} ~ {\\\\Psi^\\\\prime} Where u = impeller tip speed h = head and also Flow coefficient {\\\\phi} ~ {\\\\alpha} ~ \\\\frac { Q } {{N} {D^3}}\\\\ So assuming a function to relate Loading coefficient and the Flow coefficient {\\\\Psi} = f ({\\\\phi}) A compressor gives its best performance while operating at its design point but it is also expected to operate away from the design point. Therefore, knowledge about its behavior at off-design operation is also necessary. The quantity (tan \\\\beta_2 + tan \\\\alpha_1) can be assumed constant in a wide range of incidence. This is justified in view of small variations in the air angles at the rotor and stator exits. Therefore, writing Figure 2. Velocity triangle for compressor Stator and Rotor \\\\alpha_1 = \\\\alpha_3 A = tan \\\\beta_2 + tan \\\\alpha_3 Where U = blade peripheral velocity V_1 and V_2 are absolute air velocity at the rotor inlet and outlet V_{r1} and V_{r2} are relative velocity at rotor inlet and outlet V_3 = absolute air velocity at the stator outlet \\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2, \\\\alpha_3, \\\\beta_1 and \\\\beta_2 are the angles shown in the following Figure 2. If the design values are identified by the superscript {\\\\Psi}^{\\\\ast} = 1 - A{\\\\phi}^{\\\\ast} At off-design conditions {\\\\Psi} = 1 - A{\\\\phi}^{\\\\ast} {\\\\Psi} = 1 -(1- A{\\\\Psi}^{\\\\ast}) \\\\frac {\\\\phi} {{\\\\phi}^{\\\\ast}}\\\\ This equation also gives the off-design characteristic of an axial-flow compressor. The figure shown below depicts theoretical characteristic curves for some values of the constant A . For positive values of A , the curves are falling, while for negative values rising characteristics are obtained. Figure 3.Off design compressor characteristic curve ===Theoretical characteristic curve=== Theoretical characteristic curve of the compressor is the plot to show behavior of the fluid without considering losses due to shock and frictionFerguson, T.B., The Centrifugal Compressor Stage, Butterworth, London, 1963.Whitfield, A. and Wallace, F.J., \`Study of incidence loss models in radial and mixed flow turbomachinery\`, Instn. Mech. Engrs. Conference Publication, 3, paper No. C55/73, 1973. as it passes through the compressor at different constant speeds. The curve as shown in Figure 3. is plotted between pressure coefficient {\\\\Psi} and flow coefficient {\\\\phi} for different values of A as shown in fig. From fig. It is clear that as the flow coefficient {\\\\phi} increases the pressure gained per unit mass flow rate of the fluid decreases and due to this pressure coefficient {\\\\Psi} at higher mass flow rate will be low. Figure 4. Actual compressor characteristic curve ===Actual characteristic curveWatanabi, I. and Sakai, T., \`Effect of the cone angle of the impeller hub of the mixed flow compressor upon performance characteristics\`, SAE paper No. 996A, 1965.Whitfield, A. and Wallace, F.J., \`Performance prediction for automotive turbocharger compressors\`, Proc. Instn. Mech. Engrs. 1975.=== Actual characteristic curve of the compressor is the modified version of the theoretical characteristic curve. In this we take care of both shock and friction losses as shown in the Figure 4. As seen in the figure the steepness of the curve increases at higher mass flow rates because since there will be higher frictional losses at high flow coefficient (Darcy's friction law). ==Surging== Figure 5. Surging Surging is the complete breakdown of steady flow in the compressor which occurs at low flow rate. Surging takes place when compressor is operated off the design point and it affects the whole machine and this is aerodynamically and mechanically undesirable. It can damage the rotor bearings, rotor seals, compressor driver and affect the whole cycle operation. It results in high temperature, high vibration and leads to flow reversal.Greitzer, E.M., \`Surge and rotating stall in axial flow compressors\`, ASME J. Eng. Power, Vol. 98. No. 2, April 1967.Tsui, Chih-Ya et al., \` An experiment to improve the surge margin by use of cascade with splitter blades\`, J. Eng. Thermophys,, Vol. 1, no. 2, May 1980. ===Surge process=== Assuming the compressor operates at point A ( p_A, {\\\\dot{m}}_A ) on the characteristic curve (let at constant speed N_4 ) as shown in Figure 5. Now if the flow rate is reduced to {\\\\dot{m}}_B by closing a control valve on the delivery pipe, the static pressure upstream of the valve is increased. This increased pressure ( p_B ) is then matched by the increased delivery pressure (at B) which is developed by the compressor. Now further reducing the flow (to {\\\\dot{m}}_C and {\\\\dot{m}}_S ), the increased pressures in the delivery pipe are again matched by the compressor delivery pressures at C and S on the characteristic curve. On the characteristic curve at the flow rates below ·πÅS provides lower pressure as seen in the fig. at D and E. But now the pipe pressures due to further reduction of flow by valve (let at point D) will be higher than the pressure at D and E. This unbalance between the pipe pressure and the compressor delivery pressure only exist for a very short time. This is because there is higher pressure in the pipe than the gas pressure produced by the compressor and due to this reversing of the flow takes place and it leads to a complete break-down of the normal steady flow from the compressor to the pipe. ===Surge cycle=== Due to flow reversal, pressure in the pipe falls and the compressor regains its normal stable operation (let at point B) delivering the gas at higher flow rate ( {\\\\dot{m}}_B ). But the control valve still corresponds to the flow rate {\\\\dot{m}}_D . Due to this compressor's operating conditions will again return to D through points C and S. And due to lower compressor pressure, the pressure falls further to p_E and the entire phenomenon from point E to D repeats again and again and this cycle EBCSDE known as the surge cycle. ===Surge point=== Surge points are the peak points on the characteristic curves (as in Figure 5.) left of which the pressure generated by the compressor is less than the pipe pressure and these points initiates the surge cycle. These points on the curves are shown in the fig. by point S. ===Surge line=== Surge line is the line which connects the surge points (S) on each characteristic curve corresponding to different constant speeds. The stable range of operation for the compressor is on the right hand side of the surge line. ===Surge control line=== Surge control line is the line which works as the indicating line for the surge control mechanism so that surge can be prevented in the system and proper steps can be taken. The line can vary for different surge control systems as it is up to the system to decide the margin between operating point and the surge point. ===Surge margin=== Surge margin is the indicator to show that how close is the system to the surge. It is different for the different surge control system as they employ different surge control lines.Cumpsty, N. A. (1989). Compressor Aerodynamics. Longman. The basic surge margin can be defined as Surge margin = \\\\frac {{\\\\dot{m}_O} - {\\\\dot{m}_S}} {\\\\dot{m}_O}\\\\ Where {\\\\dot{m}_O} = mass flow rate at surge control line at a particular constant speed {\\\\dot{m}_S} = mass flow rate at surge line at the same constant speed. ==Stalling== Figure 6. Stalling process Stalling is the separation of flow from the compressor blade surface as shown in the Figure 6. At low flow rates the angle of attack increases over the critical or maximum angle that the aerodynamic profile can sustain, and due to this there occurs the flow separation on the suction side of the blades which is known as positive stalling. If the flow separation occurs on the pressure side of the blade then it's known as negative stalling and this occurs due to negative attack angle. But generally positive stalling is taken into consideration. In the compressor at high pressure stages if there occurs a deviation from design point (at which compressor is designed to operate) the angle of attack exceeds its stalling value and stall cells (which are the regions where fluid starts to whirl at a particular location and doesn't move forward) to form at hub and tip of the blade. The size of these cells increases with decreasing flow rate. If the flow rate is further reduced these cells grow larger and it affects the whole blade height and this causes significant drop in the delivery pressure and at very low flow rate, flow reversal takes place which is known as surge. It also results in drop in stage efficiency of the compressor and its delivery pressure.Howell, A. R. (1942). The present basis of axial flow compressor design: Part 1, Cascade theory and performance. ARC R and M. 2095. == Other compressor phenomena== Following are some other characteristics of the compressor ===Choke/Stonewall point=== Choking is the condition which occurs in the compressor in which it operates at very high mass flow rate and flow through the compressor can't be further increased as mach number at some part of the compressor reach to unity i.e. to sonic velocity and the flow is said to be choked. In compressor maximum volume flow rate is limited by cross-section at the inlet. This condition can be seen in the right side of the Figure 5. in which constant speed lines descends steeply. The point on constant speed line at which choking occurs is known as choke point or stonewall point. ===Choke line=== Choke line is the line joining the choke points on different constant speed lines in the Figure 5. In simple words, the operation on right side of choke line is very inefficient, but is possible if the exit static pressure is low enough and blade instabilities such as choke flutter are avoided. ===Constant efficiency lines=== Constant efficiency lines are the elliptical shaped curves in the compressor characteristic curve along which the efficiency of the compressor remains constant. ===Maximum allowable speed=== This is the maximum speed at which compressor can work properly(shown as N_4 in Figure 5.) and beyond this speed limit stresses and vibrations in the compressor crosses the prescribed limit and this can damage the compressor and to control this, compressor's speed is lowered. ===Minimum required speed=== This is the minimum speed at which compressor should operate (shown as N_0 in Figure 5.) and below this limit compressor can't increase the pressure of inlet fluid and goes into idle condition. ==References== Category:Gas compressors ","title":"Compressor characteristic"},{"id":"35830443","text":"G√°bor Csap√≥ (born 20 September 1950) is a Hungarian former water polo player who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics and in the 1980 Summer Olympics. ==See also== * List of Olympic champions in men's water polo * List of Olympic medalists in water polo * List of world champions in men's water polo * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in water polo ==References * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian male water polo players Category:Olympic water polo players of Hungary Category:Water polo players at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Water polo players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Hungary Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Hungary Category:Olympic medalists in water polo Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics ","title":"G√°bor Csap√≥"},{"id":"35830445","text":"Tiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar or Thiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar (, ) is one of the Nayanars, 63 devotees to the Hindu god Shiva who are revered as saints in Shaivism. His life is recorded in traditional hagiographies like Periya Puranam (13th century CE), Tiruto·πá·π≠ar AntƒÅdi (10th century CE) and Thiruthondar Thogai (8th century CE). The saint was serving the Shiva devotees by reading their facial expressions and understanding their actual needs. This service earned him the name Tiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar: Thiru is an honorific term in Tamil; Kurippu means \\"expressions\\" in general, and \\"facial expressions\\" in particular; and Thondar means \\"voluntary servant\\". ==Biography== Tiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar was born in a Vannar family at Kanchipuram, the ancient capital of the Pallava dynasty, which is located 76 km south-west of Tamil Nadu's modern capital of Chennai. This religious centre of South India is regarded as one of the seven holiest cities for the Hindus in India, and is also considered the land of devotees, poets, philanthropists, saints, and savants. The saint was a single minded staunch devotee of Shiva and served the devotees of Shiva by reading the faces of Nayanars. He derived utmost satisfaction in washing the clothes of Saiva devotees. The devotees of Shiva appreciated the selfless washing services of the saint and considered him as the selfless launderer. He was not only physically washing the dirt from clothes but also spiritually washing the three blemishes of the human being. Shiva decided to relieve Tiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar from the miseries of rebirth and wanted him to bless with salvation. Before this he wanted the Nayanars to go through tough times and wanted to put saint's devotion and faith by trials and testing. On an eventful day, Shiva appeared before the saint in the guise of a ripened Saiva devotee with thin frame and wearing old and dirty rags. The saint stopped him and volunteered to wash his rags. The old devotee also agreed that the clothes deserve good washing. However he also claimed that the clothes are the only possession and it protected him against the chilly weather during night time. Therefore the old devotee insisted that the clothes need to be duly washed and delivered before sunset. Tiru Kurippu Thonda, without hesitation, agreed to complete the washing service before evening. The poor man even left a warning: if the washing is delayed, the act of delay would harm his body. At that time there was enough sunlight and therefore the saint was hoping to complete the service before sunset. All of a sudden the climate become cloudy till evening and soon there was heavy rain. The saint was developing the signs of desperation and hopelessness. Soon he was wailing and weeping with grief. Even he felt guilty and attempted to break his head on the washing stone. The devotion and faith of Tiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar melted Shiva and he appeared before him and valued his act with benign grace. The determination shown by the saint earned him a place in the abode of Shiva. During the Tamil month Chithrai, the nakshatra (also known as nakshatram) () of Swathi is observed as Tiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar's puja day in all Shiva temples. ==References== Category:Nayanars ","title":"Tiru Kurippu Thonda Nayanar"},{"id":"35830478","text":"Barbullush is a settlement in the former Bushat municipality, Shkod√´r County, northern Albania.

Thompson (born March 10, 1965), is a judge of the Louisiana 26th Judicial District Court for Bossier and Webster parishes, who is a Republican former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 8, a position which he held from January 2012 to January 2015. A resident of Bossier City, Thompson ran without opposition in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on November 4, 2014, to succeed the retiring Division B Judge Ford E. Stinson Jr., a Democrat, on the 26th District Court. ==Background== A graduate of Jena High School in Jena in Central Louisiana, Thompson obtained degrees in real estate and insurance from the University of Louisiana at Monroe (1988) and the Juris Doctor from Tulane University Law School in New Orleans (1995). He was affiliated with Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. While living in Monroe, he was from 1989 to 1992 the ULM (then Northeast Louisiana University) Associate Director of Development. He was also a reserve officer with the Monroe Police Department and an insurance agent for Troy & Nichols Mortgage Company. After obtaining his law degree with honors from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, he relocated to Bossier City to engage in the practice of law and is active in the bar association. He is a member of the large Cypress Baptist Baptist Church of Benton. He is affiliated with the National Rifle Association and was a district director of the Norwela Council of the Boy Scouts of America. In 2004, he was the president of the Bossier Chamber of Commerce. Thompson and his wife, the former Toni Estelle Hurst, reside in Benton, the Bossier Parish parish seat, where the 26th Judicial District Court convenes. The couple has two children, Lillie and Rowe Thompson. ==Political life== Thompson was elected to the House in 2011, when the term-limited incumbent, fellow Republican Jane H. Smith of Bossier City, ran instead, unsuccessfully, for the Louisiana State Senate. Thompson defeated fellow Republican, Michael Durrell \\"Duke\\" Lowrie (born April 1970), 4,991 (56.8 percent) to 3,803 (43.3 percent). Smith, meanwhile, was defeated by the Republican businessman Barrow Peacock of Shreveport for the Senate seat vacated by B. L. \\"Buddy\\" Shaw. In 2008, Thompson was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 4th congressional district. The seat opened when the incumbent Jim McCrery stepped down to become a lobbyist. Thompson finished in third place in the primary. The position went to the Republican physician and businessman John C. Fleming of Minden, who held it until 2017. In the spring of 2012, Representative Thompson amended an anti-bullying bill sponsored by Patricia Smith, a Democrat from Baton Rouge. Conservative opponents of the bill claimed the measure is at odds with freedom of speech rulings by the United States Supreme Court. Thompson offered an amendment, which removed those sections of the bill that specify prohibitions against bullying in regard to only sexual orientation, disabilities, and race. Smith said that the Thompson amendment effectively killed the focus of the legislation, and she withdrew it from further consideration. Thompson opposed bullying in schools for any reason and worked to protect the educational opportunities of all children. Representative Thompson served on the House Education, Homeland Security, Ways and Means, and Military and Veterans Affairs committees. He also sits on the Joint House and Senate Committee on Homeland Security. Thompson was a leader in the Louisiana legislature to address the over 17 million pounds of propellant improperly and illegally stored at Camp Minden near Doyline, Louisiana. Mike Johnson, a Republican lawyer from Benton, was unopposed in the special election held in February 2015 to choose Thompson's successor in the House. Johnson is not the U.S. representative for the 4th congressional district. ==Court activities== In 2017, plaintiffs James Wheat and Danny Brinson, after their arrests in Bossier City for violating a state statute forbidding panhandling, filled a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Bossier Parish Sheriff Julian Curtis Whittington and all judges of the 26th Judicial District Court, including Chief Judge Parker Self and Judge Thompson. Wheat and Brinson allege that Bossier Parish unjustly jails defendants who cannot pay for bail or the required $40 fee to the office of the public defender. Nor does Bossier Parish permit defendants to seek a lowering of the bail amount, which is instead automatically set by the court. The suit claims that the parish has for years violated a \\"bedrock principle of our legal system that a person cannot be detained or imprisoned solely for their inability to pay a fee. Such an incarceration violates the substantive due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution.\\" ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Alexandria, Louisiana Category:Politicians from Monroe, Louisiana Category:University of Louisiana at Monroe alumni Category:Tulane University Law School alumni Category:Louisiana lawyers Category:Insurance agents Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:Louisiana state court judges Category:Politicians from Bossier City, Louisiana Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Baptists from Louisiana Category:People associated with the Boy Scouts of America Category:People from Benton, Louisiana ","title":"Jeff R.

Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine is a cancer treatment, research and education institution with six locations in the St. Louis area. Siteman is the only cancer center in Missouri and within 240 miles of St. Louis to be designated a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Siteman is also the only area member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit alliance of 30 cancer centers dedicated to improving the quality and effectiveness of cancer care. In 2020 and 2015, Siteman received the highest rating possible - exceptional - by the NCI for cancer research. At Siteman's reviews leading to the ratings, researchers presented their findings in genomics, cancer imaging, cancer prevention and disparities, and the use of the body's immune system to fight cancer. In 2020, Siteman was named the No. 11 U.S. cancer center (tie) by U.S. News & World Report. The recognition is part of the overall ranking of its parent institutions, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, which is No. 18 on the newsmagazine's ‚ÄúU.S. News Best Hospitals Honor Roll,‚Äù and Washington University School of Medicine, which is tied for No. 6 on the newsmagazine's \\"2021 Best Medical Schools: Research\\" list. Siteman treats more than 75,000 individual patients, including 12,000 newly diagnosed patients, every year. ==Locations== Siteman's main facility is at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis‚Äô Central West End neighborhood. Five other St. Louis-area sites offer specialized cancer care in suburban locations: ==History and leadership== In 1999, Alvin J. and Ruth Siteman committed $35 million to the development of the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The commitment was the largest gift ever received by Barnes-Jewish and Washington University in support of cancer research, patient care and services, education and community outreach. Timothy Eberlein, M.D., has been director of the center since its inception. John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., is deputy director. In 2001, the NCI designated Siteman as a Cancer Center, which signaled that the institution had demonstrated significant scope and quality in its cancer research programs. The designation came with $850,000 per year in federal research grants. The NCI named Siteman a Comprehensive Cancer Center in 2005, recognizing its broad-based research, outreach and education activities, and awarded the center a five-year, $21 million support grant. The NCI renewed the designation in 2010 and awarded another five-year grant, totaling $23 million. The grants fund programs and specialized services that promote multidisciplinary research, as well as shared scientific resources and seed awards that enable investigators to develop and pursue new research opportunities. Alvin J. Siteman announced in 2010 that he would donate $1 million annually to an endowment fund at the center to advance cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment programs that might not receive federal funding. ==Patient care and services== More than 350 Washington University research scientists and physicians provide inpatient and outpatient care at Siteman. The center also offers patient and family support services, including discussion and education groups. In 2018, Siteman announced it would build a second proton therapy unit at its S. Lee Kling Proton Therapy Center. The first opened in late 2013. ==Research== Scientists and physicians affiliated with Siteman hold more than $145 million in cancer research and related training grants. The results of basic laboratory research are rapidly incorporated into treatment advances. This process is enhanced by patient access to more than 500 therapeutic clinical studies, including many collaborative efforts with other leading cancer centers throughout the country. In 2013, three scientists affiliated with Siteman, Washington University School of Medicine and the McDonnell Genome Institute were included on the Thomson Reuters list of ‚ÄúHottest Scientific Researchers of 2012‚Äù: Richard K. Wilson, Ph.D.; Elaine Mardis, Ph.D.; and Li Ding, Ph.D. The list recognized the 21 most-cited researchers of 2012. Robert Fulton, a fourth scientist from Washington University School of Medicine and the McDonnell Genome Institute, also made the list. ===Research advances=== Researchers affiliated with Siteman and/or Washington University School of Medicine have pioneered important advances in cancer research, prevention, education and treatment. Highlights and ongoing studies include these projects: 2019 ‚Äî Tailoring brain cancer treatment * Researchers have identified distinct molecular signatures of glioblastoma in men and women that help explain why more males get this type of brain cancer and generally have lower survival rates than females. The research suggests that tailoring treatments to men and women with glioblastoma based on the molecular subtypes of their tumors may improve survival for all patients. 2018 ‚Äî Personalized brain cancer vaccines * In a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a glioblastoma vaccine, some patients \\"lived significantly longer\\" - up to seven years longer - than most people who are diagnosed with the brain cancer. Researchers developed personalized vaccines for each patient, removing as much of the brain tumor as possible, then combining pieces of the tumor with cells from the patient's immune system. This \\"trains\\" the immune cells to attack tumor cells. 2017 ‚Äî CAR-T cell therapy and using Zika virus to fight brain cancer * In a clinical trial at Siteman, at least 16 of 20 people who received a new treatment called CAR-T cell therapy saw their cancers disappear after treatment. The patients had previously failed standard therapies. The therapy, Axicabtagene ciloleucel, received FDA approval on Oct. 18, 2017. * While Zika virus causes devastating damage to the brains of developing fetuses, it one day may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer. Joint research from Washington University School of Medicine and UC San Diego School of Medicine shows that the virus kills brain cancer stem cells, the kind of cells most resistant to standard treatments. 2016 ‚Äî Chemotherapy for brain tumors * Neurosurgeons using lasers to treat brain cancer discover that the technique breaks down the blood-brain barrier for about four weeks, allowing them to use chemotherapy to treat the tumor. A clinical trial is still ongoing, but Eric C. Leuthardt, M.D., considers the initial results promising. 2015 ‚Äî Melanoma vaccine and urine test for kidney cancer * In a proof of concept study, a research team led by Beatriz Carreno, Ph.D., shows that personalized medicine can \\"wake up\\" the immune systems of melanoma patients. Further study needs to be done to see if the customized vaccines can prevent recurrence in patients with advanced melanoma. * A urine-based screening test is found to be more than 95 percent accurate in identifying early-stage kidney cancer, according to a study led by Evan Kharasch, M.D., Ph.D. 2014 ‚Äî Breast cancer vaccine and cancer goggles * A breast cancer vaccine developed by William Gillanders, M.D., is shown to activate the immune system to fight tumor cells and slow down cancer progression. The vaccine, which targets mammaglobin-A, a protein expressed in breast tumors, involved very few side effects. * High-tech goggles developed by Samuel Achilefu, Ph.D., help surgeons see cancer cells in real time. The technology, which includes a digital display, infrared light and use of an intravenous dye, could negate the need for follow-up surgeries due to undetected cancer cells. 2013 ‚Äî Endometrial cancer and leukemia * In separate studies, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine and the McDonnell Genome Institute help identify major genetic mutations that promote endometrial cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. The research, part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, provides new information that could change treatments for patients and aid drug development. 2012 ‚Äî Leukemia, breast cancer research and cancer prevention * Siteman leukemia doctor Lukas Wartman, M.D., who was diagnosed with the disease himself, goes into remission for an unprecedented third time after Timothy Ley, M.D., and his colleagues at the McDonnell Genome Institute sequenced Wartman's cancerous and normal genes. Researchers also analyzed his RNA. By doing so, his treatment team, which includes John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director of Siteman, discovered that a normal gene might be contributing to the growth of Wartman's cancer by producing mass amounts of a certain protein. They found that a drug used to treat a type of kidney cancer was able to inhibit the gene. * Scientists including Matthew Ellis, M.B., Ph.D., use whole genome sequencing to compare differences between the DNA of breast cancer tumors and healthy cells in 46 women. While revealing the complexity of the disease, the analysis suggests routes to personalized medicine that may have a greater probability of healing patients. * Building on his research for the Nurses Health Study and Growing Up Today Study, Graham Colditz, M.D., Dr.P.H., continues to examine links between cancer and alcohol use, diet, exercise and other factors and what individuals and communities can do to reduce disease risk. In a 2012 paper, Colditz argues that half of all cancer cases can be prevented, thereby saving more than 280,000 people in 2011, and that individuals, medical and health experts, government officials and others must start taking already known steps to reduce cancer's impact. 2011 ‚Äî Blood-related cancers * Siteman completes its 5,000th hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a common therapy for patients with blood-related cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma or another blood- related cancer. 2010 ‚Äî Pediatric cancers * Washington University School of Medicine and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital announce their joint Pediatric Cancer Genome Project to identify the genetic changes that give rise to some of the world's deadliest childhood cancers. The team plans to decode the genomes of more than 600 childhood cancer patients who have contributed tumor samples. 2008 ‚Äî Genetic sequencing * For the first time, scientists decode all the genes of a cancer patient and find a suite of mutations that might have caused the disease or aided its progression. Timothy Ley, M.D., Elaine Mardis, Ph.D., Richard K. Wilson, Ph.D., and their colleagues at McDonnell Genome Institute say the finding could lead to new therapies and could help doctors make better choices among existing treatments, based on a more detailed genetic picture of each patient's cancer. Though the research involved acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the same techniques can also be used to study other cancers. 2007 ‚Äî Nanotechnology and radiation therapy * Gregory Lanza, M.D., Ph.D., Samuel Wickline, M.D., and researchers in their labs announce the development of nanoparticles, significantly smaller than the width of a human hair, aimed at attacking cancer by locating and \\"latching on\\" to tumors. Used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging, the nanoparticles could help physicians monitor cancerous tissue and deliver medicine directly to the tumor, not to the rest of the body. * Researchers led by Daniel Low, Ph.D., and Parag Parikh, M.D., develop a machine called the 4D Phantom that follows a patient's complex breathing pattern to deliver radiation therapy to tumors that move, such as those in the lung. 2006 ‚Äî Photoacoustic imaging * Lihong Wang, Ph.D., announces his work on photoacoustic imaging, a new technique that uses light and sound to create detailed, color pictures of tumors and organs. The noninvasive imaging technique, which can be performed without the dangers of radiation exposure associated with X-ray and CT scans, also may help doctors detect cancer earlier than ever before, its developers say.√ü 2003 ‚Äî Breast cancer * Thalachallour Mohanakumar, Ph.D., and other researchers at Siteman develop and test on mice a prototype vaccine that causes cancerous tumors to stop growing, then to shrink. The vaccine, which is being developed to fight breast cancer in humans, helps the immune system target a protein found in 80 percent of breast tumors. 2001 ‚Äî Imaging and the immune system's role in controlling cancer * Research led by Joanne Mortimer, M.D., shows that positron emission tomography (PET) scans can often identify within two weeks which women with advanced breast cancer are likely to respond to hormone therapy, a gentler alternative to chemotherapy that is usually just as effective. * Robert D. Schreiber, Ph.D., and colleagues publish the first evidence that the immune system plays a role in controlling cancer, a process called immunosurveillance. In 2007, they find in mice that some cancers are kept in a state of \\"equilibrium,\\" which leads them to suggest that one day immunotherapy may convert cancer into a chronic but controllable disease. * Molecular oncologist Howard McLeod announces research on a genetic mutation that affects how well patients will respond to chemotherapy. The findings may make possible a blood test that would determine what dose, or even which drugs, would be most effective for each patient. 1998 ‚Äî Biopsies * Ralph G. Dacey Jr., M.D., performs the world's first magnetic stereotactic surgery to biopsy a human brain tumor using an indirect route to the tumor. The route is designed to avoid regions that would normally be entered when a surgeon manually inserts a surgical tool straight at a site. The investigational computerized system allows surgeons to carefully manipulate surgical tools inside the brain through the use of a catheter driven by precisely controlled magnetic fields. 1994 ‚Äî Genetic screening test for thyroid cancer * Led in part by Helen Donis- Keller, Ph.D., researchers for the first time develop genetic screening tests that detect a rare, lethal form of thyroid cancer in the preclinical state, permitting early treatment in children predisposed to the disease. It was the first surgical prevention of cancer based on genetic test results. 1979 ‚Äî Bone marrow transplants * As part of a clinical trial, leukemia patients at Washington University in St. Louis and four other medical centers receive transplants of their healthy bone marrow cells to determine how effective the procedure is in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The new technique would later be called autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Mid-1970s ‚Äî Imaging * Michel Ter-Pogossian, Ph.D., leads the research that will turn the PET scanner from an intriguing concept to a medical imaging technique used by hospitals and laboratories everywhere to scan the working brain. 1954 ‚Äî Growth factors and cancer * Rita Levi- Montalcini, Ph.D., and Stanley Cohen, Ph.D., isolate for the first time nerve growth factor, a potent substance that promotes nerve cell growth.

He has a worldly perspective and travels to Europe for extended periods of time with his wife and children. He is the male protagonist of this story. :: Nancy Gale: A resident of East Rodney Maine. She spent almost the entirety of her life in this small coastal town (a kind of local celebrity). Nancy is known for her beauty, humility and charm. She takes great joy in dancing. :: Mr. Gale: Nancy‚Äôs father. He spends his life taking care of her once she is ill. :: Uncle Ezra: Nancy‚Äôs uncle who lives four miles outside the city of Boston on a farm with his wife. He is a hard working, stern older man. He carries a lot of affection for his niece. He hosts Nancy when she visits Boston. :: Mr. Daniel Carew: Tom Aldis‚Äô friend who hurts his ankle while the two are in East Rodney, Maine. We never hear him speak. * Plot Summary: : The first section of the story is centered on the relationship between Nancy Gale and Tom Aldus throughout their lives. It begins in Boston several months after Tom spent time with Nancy‚Äôs family in East Rodney, Maine. Tom was forced to spend time on the island as his friend sprained his ankle and could no longer travel. Tom and Nancy share a deep connection, which hints at romance but is never explicitly stated (Tom spends much time emphasizing Nancy‚Äôs great beauty). This is Nancy‚Äôs first visit to Boston (she is staying with her Aunt and Uncle Ezra four miles outside of the city). Tom gets permission from Ezra to spend the day with Nancy in the city. He is beguiled by her excitement at the city and helps her purchase gifts for several of her family members back home. She then attends a dance class with Tom‚Äôs aunt, a woman she finds extremely elegant and poised. Nancy informs Tom that a young woman whom he was involved with in East Rodney the previous summer is now seeing another suitor. As the two say good-bye, Tom hopes they will see each other soon. The second section of the story begins 15 years after their day together in Boston. The two have not spoken this entire time. Tom is now married with children. Tom laments his desire to have written to Nancy many times, once during his engagement and another when he left the US for Europe for an extended period of time. He did, however, send her many books. Tom is traveling to East Rodney to survey land purchased by his father. When he arrives he is excited to see Nancy. He attends a ball and is greeted by Nancy‚Äôs father who informs him that she has been ill with a serious form of rheumatoid arthritis for quite sometime. She is no longer capable of leaver one room in her house. She spends her days giving dance lessons and giving extra help to students from the local school who are having learning troubles. She remains the life of the town. Tom is deeply saddened by this information and travels the next day to visit her. Upon seeing her, he is immediately happy and remembers their lifelong friendship (which he thinks has not changed at all). She expresses how happy she is to see him, but does not spend a lot of time complaining of her situation. The next section of the story begins several months later. Tom has now built a new house on his fathers land (which he was originally going to sell). There is no longer any mention of his wife or children. He has also purchased Nancy a form of wheel chair, which she uses to leave her house and visit Tom outside in the beautiful weather. Everyone in the town is happy that she is able to move about ‚Äì even if she can no longer walk. The story ends with Tom and Nancy sharing an emotional moment in which she says ‚Äúthere never has been a day when I haven‚Äôt thought of you‚Äù. Her last line emphasizes the emotional and possibly romantic bond that the two share, even after so much time has passed. :: : === \\"Fame‚Äôs Little Day\\" === * Characters : Mr. Abel Pinkham: male protagonist of this story. He is the owner and founder of Pinkham Maple Sugar Company in Vermont. He feels extremely attached to his life in the countryside of Vermont. :: Mrs. Mary- Ann Pinkham: Wife of Abel Pinkham. Also very fond of her life in the countryside. Well to do, but extremely humble (just like her husband). Loves cooking. :: Mr. Fitch: Well off business partner of Mr. Abel Pinkham and resident of New Jersey with his wife. He has a reputation for being an honest businessman and an extremely loyal friend. * Plot Summary: : This story is much shorter than the first. It begins with a short description of why Mr. Pinkham‚Äôs visit to New York City was featured in the newspaper by a particular reporter. The story then focuses on the rest of Mr. and Mrs. Pinkham‚Äôs business trip to New York City. The two stay in an extremely fancy hotel. They do not have friends in the city and are very uncomfortable with the noise and fast-paced nature of city life. They soon find out that they have been featured in the Tribune newspaper, which brings both of them extreme joy and pride. Mrs. Pinkham decides to cut out the article and send it to her daughter, Sarah. In the second chapter of the story, Mr. Pinkham partakes in a business deal with Mr. Fitch. Mr. Fitch purchases a very large order of Maple Sugar (as he knows Mr. Pinkham‚Äôs product is the best). The two men share a quick exchange about the various papers that Mr. Pinkham and his wife are featured in. Mr. Fitch jokes that he is in such prestigious company. Later than day Mr. and Mrs. Pinkham go to purchase the several newspapers that in which the two are discussed- they find that one newspaper even created a fake interview with Mr. Pinkham and a reporter. Mr. Pinkham wants to take his wife to the circus, but she fears that it is not dignified enough for the two of them to be scene there. She is slightly embarrassed by her out of season clothing, but her husband reassures her that she is beautiful. He decides that they should to spend their hard-earned money in any way that they choose, so they hire a carriage to take them around (despite protests from Mrs. Pinkham for the two to take the cheaper route). The final chapter of this story takes place in the Ethan Allen Hotel in which the elderly couple is staying in New York City. The two lament just how wonderful the city is and how much flattery they have received throughout their stay. Shortly after, the original reporter who wrote about them in the paper greets them at the door of their hotel. He does not introduce himself, but rather bows to them out of respect. He is intimidated by their new exuding self-confidence and decides not to ask Mr. Pinkham to speak at a business venture the next day. Mr. and Mrs. Pinkham decide that this man was of no consequence- they have become extremely egotistical. === \\"A War Debt\\" === * Characters Tom Burton: The male protagonist of the story. Lost both of his parents at a very young age and was raised by his grandmother, Mrs. Burton. He enjoys traveling and frequently takes extremely long trips. :: Mrs. Burton: The sole family member of Tom Burton, she lives in Boston during the winter. :: Dennis: Works for Tom and Mrs. Burton at their home in Boston. :: Mr. Bellamy: elder plantation owner in Virginia. Lives with Wife, Mrs. Bellamy on their worn down plantation in Virginia. Went to Harvard with Tom Burton‚Äôs grandfather. :: Mrs. Bellamy: Mr. Bellamy‚Äôs wife. She is crippled and unable to walk. * Plot Summary The first chapter of this story begins with Tom Burton on a walk in Boston. He thinks of how it is too early in the winter season to have moved to the city, but his grandmother is stuck in her old ways. She is his only living family and he loves her dearly. He has recently returned from a three-year trip to find his grandmother much older and dependent on him. He is now living with her in Boston with no plans to take any long-term vacations in the near future. He then goes to have tea with her and the two enjoy a day of gossip, tea and food. The Second chapter of this story continues with Tom and his grandmother eating dinner. The two discuss their days and enjoy one another‚Äôs company. As soon as Dennis, their servant leaves the room Tom‚Äôs grandmother rushes to a secret cabinet to show Dennis a piece of silverware. Tom is confused by her impatient/nervous demeanor but follows her nevertheless. She pulls out a silver cup with two handles and tells Tom that it was stolen during the war. She says that her father purchased it from someone who had taken it from the rubble of someone‚Äôs home in Virginia. She laments that she has been struggling with feelings of guilt since she received it from Tom‚Äôs father - who we learned died shortly after purchasing the cup along with Tom‚Äôs mother. She asks Tom to return it to its rightful owner. Tom accepts the challenge to travel to Virginia to find the family to which the cup belongs. His only clue is the crest that is on the cup, which reads ‚ÄúJe vous en prie Bellamy!‚Äù. He learns that it belongs to the Bellamy‚Äôs, a once very wealthy and powerful Virginian family. He begins to plan for his trip. The third, and shortest, chapter of this story gives a short description of the train ride that Tom takes to Virginia. He is upset by the lack of order that exists between White and Black people on the train. Upon arrival he immediately notices a beautiful girl speaking with her friends. He becomes slightly infatuated with her and they make eye contact while he listens to her and her friends discuss the upcoming horse races. Tom then travels by horse to the Bellamy estate. Mr. Bellamy, the owner of the house, immediately greets him. Tom introduces himself as Burton‚Äôs grandson, who Mr. Bellamy went to Harvard with. Mr. Bellamy takes tom into his home to meet his wife. The two are introduced and Tom is invited to stay for dinner. He is also asked to stay in their granddaughter's room, as she is absent. Tom takes a walk around the estate and observes the old slave quarters- it seems he is slightly saddened by it. Tom returns to the main house for dinner. Mrs. Bellamy is carried to the table, as she is crippled. They enjoy the dinner of fish and the bird that Tom shot earlier in the day. It is apparent that the house was once such a great place, but the war took many of the family‚Äôs riches. Mr. Bellamy is dressed in a slightly tattered suit. After Mrs. Bellamy leaves for bed, Mr. Bellamy and Tom decide to smoke. Tom goes to get his pipe and brings Mr. Bellamy the silver cup. Mr. Bellamy is overjoyed at the return of this object that he is brought to tears. He tells tom that his family calls this cup, ‚Äútheir lucky cup‚Äù. The two men greatly enjoy each other‚Äôs company and are extremely nostalgic for the past. Tom feels he has found a true friend and that he has replaced his grandfather in Mr. Bellamy‚Äôs mind. They smoke and drink for a while before they go to sleep. The next morning Tom joins Mr. Bellamy on a walk around the property. Both of them are sad at how the land has been ruined by the war. Several African American families approach Mr. Bellamy, and it is apparent that he has been helping them with food and the like for a while. He sends them to the kitchen area to get help. Tom gives Mr. Bellamy his gun and Mr. Bellamy accepts it from both Tom and his grandfather. They hope to see each other again and Tom hopes to be treated as a son for both Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy, as they lost all their kids in the war. Tom soon realizes that the portrait hanging in the main entrance to the house of Mrs. Bellamy is familiar as it looks like girl he saw his first day in Virginia. He learns that she is their granddaughter. :: :: : === \\"The Hiltons Holiday\\" === * Character List: : John Hilton: Male protagonist of the story. Owner and farmer at Hilton Farm.

We learn that William was quite talented at sewing and knitting as a child. Some time passes and Israel returns to his regular life. His sister leaves- and Israel hires a summer hand for help. The two have quite a strained relationship as Israel finds the boy to be lazy but it works out. The next chapter of this story begins two months after the passing of Martha Haydon. William and his son are sitting on the porch of his house discussing the lack of order in his house. William says that he feels his father is angry at him for something and wishes to apologize. Israel, however, says it is simply that he is still grieving his wife. He says that he cannot maintain the state of the house the way his wife used to. William invites his father over for dinner and to see Maria Durrant, a woman that could possibly work for him as a housekeeper. Israel met her a while ago when William‚Äôs wife was sick and thinks she is one of the most able women he has ever met. When they meet, they immediately take to each other. The next morning Maria ignores Israel‚Äôs request to begin work in the afternoon, and decides to start early. She leaves William‚Äôs house and arrives at Israel‚Äôs farm. There she notices the terrible state of the garden and decides to bring it back to the state in which it was when Martha tended to it- Israel told her earlier in the evening that he wanted to do this himself but was having trouble. :: The fourth chapter of this book takes place entirely in Mr. Haydon‚Äôs kitchen. Martha Durrant is mending some clothing, when a visitor surprises her. The visitor is an old acquaintance of both Maria and Israel by the name of Polly Norris. She is an extremely irritating woman who is not completely sane of mind. She frequently visits people to ask for help. The two gossip a while. Polly informs Maria that there is a rumor going around that she has been at the farm for too long. People are beginning to think that she wants to marry Mr. Haydon. Polly then quickly changes the subject as she realizes that Maria is upset. She asks Maria for an old work robe to use and Maria quickly leaves the room. Their visit ends shortly after and Maria begins to cry uncontrollably. She feels that this is the first time that she has been happy in a long while. She thinks that she now has to leave the farm and go back to her brother‚Äôs house. She works extremely hard in his hotel- tending for guests and her cruel sister-in-law, and does not receive any thanks. Israel comes inside the house and Maria tells him that she needs to leave. He refuses and surprisingly tells her that he has been talking to William and they have decided that he should marry Maria, if she will accept him. She accepts his proposal without saying anything. :: The final chapter of this story takes place after church one Sunday. Maria and Israel are now married. Maria thinks to herself how lucky she is that she has such a loving husband. The two begin to discuss the late Martha. Maria is extremely kind when discussing her. She continually complements her ‚Äòpredecessor‚Äô and so does Israel. Maria suggests that they should invite one of Martha‚Äôs oldest friends to the house for tea, as Martha used to. When the guest arrives a day later, Israel overhears the two ladies talking about how sad he was when Martha died. Maria comments that she is so lucky to have met him, but sad that she is not as significant as Martha. The guest comments that she has never seen Israel so happy since he was a young man. After the guest leaves Israel comes inside and tells Martha that he is so happy to have met her, that she is a ‚Äúgood wife‚Äù- replacing Martha with Maria once and for all. :: :: :: === \\"Little French Mary\\" === * Characters : Old Captain Weathers: Older man in Dulham.

She is waiting for a visitor on a beautiful June day, Cynthia Pickett. The two are not such great friends but recently have become closer. For this reason, there is still much formality between the two of them when they meet. Persis is described as being a slightly sour woman, but she enjoyed the company of Cynthia. Cynthia arrives and the two discuss a meeting with Mrs. Timms. Cynthia is unsure if she should go, but Persis ensures her that Mrs. Timms is so excited to see them both. Cynthia tentatively agrees- she doesn't want to overstay her welcome at Persis‚Äô house and decides to leave. When she leaves, Persis is saddened that she did not get to close the gate herself, something she enjoys doing. :: In the next chapter, both women walk to visit Mrs. Timms at her house in Baxter. Both are dressed in some of their finest clothing, Persis in black cashmere and Cynthia in a black dress. Persis has brought a homemade jelly as a gift for Mrs. Timms. Cynthia is embarrassed that she did not think to bring a gift and discusses again how she is unsure that Mrs. Timms initially wanted her to come to her house. But Cynthia is now thankful that Persis convinced her to go with. Persis asks Cynthia to mention a recipe of Mrs. Timms once they arrive so as to complement her. Cynthia agrees to try and mention it to Mrs. Timms. The two ladies begin to walk fast as they are late and a stagecoach is approaching them! :: The two women settle in the back of the stagecoach and begin conversing amongst themselves. All of a sudden they begin talking with a stranger sitting next to them. They learn that she is going to visit a friend she met at a religious conference. The ladies discuss their particular sects of religion. After a short while they pass a house that Persis recognizes as that of Ms. Ezra Beckett, the stranger comments that that is the woman she is going to visit! The stagecoach comes to a halt and the stranger exits. A confused Ezra, who does not remember meeting this woman, greets the stranger. The stranger tries to convince Ezra of their meeting, and Persis and Cynthia look on. The bus drives away, and the ladies say they will tell Mrs. Timms this story when they arrive. Persis once again reminds Cynthia to mention the recipe to Mrs. Timms. :: The two ladies arrive at Mrs. Timms house. She takes a while to answer the door. When she does, she is surprised to see both Persis and Cynthia there. She invites the ladies into a parlor room and sits on a chair slightly too far away for their to be a good rapport during the visit. They discuss a few subjects, but the visit seems impersonal. Mrs. Timms does not offer them a tour of the house, nor does she ask them to make themselves comfortable. The whole visit is extremely short and cordial. The ladies leave and are both slightly speechless about how poorly the meeting went. Persis even wishes Mrs. Timms some ill. They decide to visit Mrs. Nancy Fell and tell her they just felt like traveling. They leave slightly saddened by Mrs. Timms. :: In the final chapter of this story, Cynthia and Persis are riding home from their visits with Nancy and Mrs. Timms in the same stagecoach that they took that morning. They discuss how pleasant their visit with Nancy was. She was extremely hospitable and fed them well. Persis quotes from the bible to emphasize the pleasantries of their visit. They comment again on how rude Mrs. Timms was during their meeting- saying that she could have turned them away if it was inconvenient for her at that moment. They pass Ezra Beckett‚Äôs house again and find the stranger from earlier sitting peacefully in the window. Ezra comes outside to tell the driver that they need to send for the girl‚Äôs bags, confusing all of the passengers who had seen the strange exchange earlier in the day.

The contractor comes to ask John packer if he would like to sell him two timber trees in his backyard. John is extremely irritable and refuses to sell them to the offer of $75. He says that he doesn't care if they fall down and he can manage them himself, to which the contractor objects. John then decides to leave and notices two people looking at him from inside the house. The contractor claims that he will not raise his offer. :: In the next chapter, John enters his home after a day's work outside to find his wife, Mary Hannah and his daughter Lizzie in the kitchen. It is clear that Lizzie has been crying and he cannot understand why she is upset. After Lizzie leaves the room, Mary tells her husband that Lizzie had been watching him talk earlier with Mr. Farris and thought that he was going to sell the trees. Lizzie is extremely attached to the trees, as they are kind of a landmark to the family and the town in general. Mary makes her husband a mean before he heads out to the town center. John thinks to himself that he should keep the trees, as the women of his house love them so dearly- the town does as well. We learn that Mr. Farris is a sneaky businessman who has taken advantage of many people in times of need- paid them less than deserved for their timber. Mr. Farris is upset that he has not signed the business deal with John. He looks at the trees and thinks to himself how important they are to everyone: lovers, children and friends. In this next chapter of the story, two new characters are introduced Chauncey and Joe Banks. While Mr. Ferris and John talk on the shore, these two other men fish out in the water. They complain that there is no more fish. Chauncey wants to stop for the season, but Joe wants to stay out longer. It begins to snow. They begin to discuss the matter of the timber trees between Ferris and John. Chauncey tells Joe that he needs to sign a petition in town to keep the trees. Joe says that although John is an unpleasant man, he is not a bad person and they think he will decide in their favor. They fear that the petition will do no good. :: The next morning is Christmas Eve, and John decides to take his fishing boat out to think over the tree matter alone. He thinks to himself that the $80 would be so helpful if his daughter were to marry Joe. When he gets to the fishing dock he sees Joe and reluctantly invites him to come fishing with him. Joe declines and John takes out the boat alone. He thinks to himself about his family and about the trees. Despite his rough exterior he does have a need to be accepted by the community. This makes his decision even more difficult. Before he gets a chance to decide he sees Mr. Farris driving his woodchoppers towards the trees. He tries to get to shore, but knows that he will not be able to do it in time. He laments that he has been a fool and knows he must keep the trees. He hopes that Lizzie will stall Mr. Farris. :: The next chapter begins with Joe and Lizzie at the Packer farm on Christmas. They all hear a loud noise and Joe tells John that the whole town has come to celebrate him for stopping Farris from cutting down the trees! The whole town comes to the party and they all celebrate.

She is the widow of Captain Lunn. When her husband died, he lost his fortune, so presently she has no money. However, she is an extremely thrifty woman and, therefore, is very good at saving money. When her husband died, she was much younger than him. Her friends now are more interested in her behavior as she has taken an interest in three Captains of the fishing town: Captain Shaw, Crowe and Witherspoon. The author then introduces herself for the first time in the book. She thinks that it is important to describe all three captains. She tells us that Captain Witherspoon is an extremely small man with a very large ego- he is very outgoing. Captain Crowe is extremely tall and clumsy. He lacks confidence and is very shy. Captain Shaw is the most pleasing of the three as he has a larger shipping business, as he owns a tugboat. His sisters, however, are not happy at the idea of him marrying again and so this has made it very difficult for him. All three are in love with Maria. She likes Witherspoon the best as he is a hopeless romantic and extremely good with children. She thinks he is the best company for her. :: The next chapter begins with Captain Shaw visiting Maria at her home one evening. He arrives and moments later there is another knock on the door. To everyone‚Äôs surprise, Captain Crowe arrives at her house. He is dressed in his best coat, and Shaw feels embarrassed for not having dressed up. The two men exchange pleasantries, with hints of criticism and jealousy. Maria quickly interrupts them and changes the conversation to avoid confrontation. Soon there is another knock and Witherspoon arrives with gifts of fish. All three men hoped to visit Maria alone. After they leave they all say to themselves in private that they should figure out a way to impress Maria. :: The next chapter takes place in a fishing warehouse. Witherspoon is there to air it out when he runs into Crowe. The two reminisce about the old fishing days. Now there are not enough fish to go around and business has turned sour. They lament that they never expected to see their town become this way. They begin to talk about Maria Lunn and gossip about which man she might choose. Witherspoon says he is sad that he is alone- that he never expected to remain single for his life. They discuss their competition in Mr. Shaw who has the most money, but they feel he is not right for Maria Lunn. :: In this chapter, Maria has just returned from a trip to a funeral for her cousin who passed. She thinks to herself how kind this cousin was to her- gave her money and the like. Maria is on her way to church wearing her Sunday best.

Many of the townspeople are surprised to both see her at church and at her decision to waste no time in gaining the affections of the minister. Rumors begin to spread about her engagement to the minister, yet she is unscathed by the negativity as many people support her decision. She has especially offended Crowe‚Äôs sisters who feel Maria misled their brother. :: In this final chapter of the story, each of the three captains pay a visit to Mrs. Lunn to propose to her. Shaw pleads with her with his wealth and power, but she refuses him. Crowe is refused before he even has a chance to ask. However, when Witherspoon arrives and begins to share his feelings, the two share a mutual understanding that they should be together. The business with the minister is settled- he will be a paid boarder at their house.

Based in Austin, Texas, his service on the Railroad Commission extended from 1995 to 2005; as chancellor, from 2005 to 2010. ==Background== A native of Waco, Texas, Matthews received his higher education later in life, having graduated with a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies in 1994 from the University of Texas at Dallas. In 1999, he received a master's degree in public administration from Texas State University in San Marcos, then known as Southwest Texas State University. In 2006, he was awarded a Ph.D. in higher education administration from the University of Texas at Austin. ==Political career== From 1984 to 1986, Matthews was the mayor of Garland, Texas, a nonpartisan position in which he worked to reduce the tax rate and to cut municipal expenditures. In 1986, he lost a race for county judge in Dallas County. In 1994, he unseated veteran Democratic Railroad Commissioner James E. Nugent. Matthews outpolled Nugent, 2,046,614 votes (49.8 percent) to 1,978,759 (48.1 percent). Another 84,769 votes were cast (2.1 percent) for the Libertarian Rich Draheim. In 2000, Matthews won reelection to the Railroad Commission without Democratic opposition. He received 3,633,901 votes (77 percent), with the remaining 23 percent split between two minor party contenders. As railroad commissioner, Matthews supported more exploration for natural gas to meet future electricity needs. ==TSU system chancellorship== Early in 2005, Matthews stepped down from the Railroad Commission to succeed Lamar Urbanovsky as the university system chancellor. Matthews served on the Texas Turnpike Authority under appointment from Republican Governor Bill Clements. He is a former director, president, and chief executive officer of the Texas Municipal Power Agency. Originally established in 1911 to supervise the normal schools of Texas, the TSU system, which Matthews headed for five years, consists of nine institutions: Texas State University-San Marcos, Angelo State University in San Angelo, Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Lamar University in Beaumont, the Lamar Institute of Technology, Lamar State College-Orange, Lamar State College-Port Arthur, Sul Ross State University in Alpine, and Rio Grande College of Sul Ross State University. These schools enroll more than seventy thousand students. ==Personal life== Matthews is the former president of Housing Administrators, Inc., president and CEO of M Mortgage Company, a director of Southern Bank and Trust/Texas Commerce Bank, and the owner/operator of Matthews Investments. He is a former member of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and the National Coal Council. Matthews has been active in Rotary International, the Lion's Club, Young Men's Christian Association, and the Boy Scouts of America. He served as chairman of the Garland Chamber of Commerce and received the highest honor of the Garland business community, the Tall Texan Award. He and his wife, the former Julia Freeman (born January 19, 1945), a native of McAllen, Texas, reside in rural Aquilla near Hillsboro, Texas. They have four children. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Railroad Commission of Texas Category:Mayors of places in Texas Category:Texas Republicans Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:People from Waco, Texas Category:Politicians from Austin, Texas Category:People from Garland, Texas Category:People from Hill County, Texas Category:People associated with the Boy Scouts of America Category:Educators from Texas ","title":"Charles Matthews (Texas politician)"},{"id":"35830950","text":"Attila Sud√°r (born 11 April 1954) is a Hungarian former water polo player who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics and in the 1980 Summer Olympics. ==See also== * List of Olympic champions in men's water polo * List of Olympic medalists in water polo * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in water polo ==References * Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian male water polo players Category:Olympic water polo players of Hungary Category:Water polo players at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Water polo players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Hungary Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Hungary Category:Olympic medalists in water polo Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics ","title":"Attila Sud√°r"},{"id":"35830965","text":"The Manufacturers‚Äô Agents National Association (MANA), was founded in 1947 and is the largesthttp://www.manaonline.org/?cat=31 North American association of manufacturers‚Äô reps. ==Scope and operations== MANA is a 501(c)6 not-for- profit, horizontal, industry-independent organization for reps and their principals.

They also include data for the Grand Slam tournaments and the year-end championships. The table is sorted by: 1) total number of titles (a doubles title won by two players representing the same nation counts as only one win for the nation); 2) highest amount of highest category tournaments (for example, having a single Grand Slam gives preference over any kind of combination without a Grand Slam title); 3) a singles > doubles > mixed doubles hierarchy; 4) alphabetical order (by family names for players). ;Key {class= style=font-size:90%;width:18% -F3E6D7;\\" Grand Slam tournaments -bgcolor=#ffffcc Year-end championships -bgcolor=#d8cef6 Virginia Slims event } ===Titles won by player=== {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:90% - !width=30Total !width=200Player !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 F3E6D7;\\" !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef - align=center  efefef;\\"16 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè ‚óè  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"  ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"9  efefef;\\"7  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"13 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè  ffc;\\"  ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"3  efefef;\\"9  efefef;\\"1 - align=center  efefef;\\"5 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"  ‚óè  ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"3  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"5 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"  ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè   efefef;\\"5  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"4 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"4  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"4 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè  ffc;\\"  ‚óè ‚óè  ‚óè  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"1  efefef;\\"1 - align=center  efefef;\\"4 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"4  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"4 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"4  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"3 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè ‚óè ‚óè  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"    efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"3  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"2 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"2 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"2 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"‚óè  ‚óè   efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"2 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"2 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"2 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"1 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"‚óè  ffc;\\"    efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"1 - align=center  efefef;\\"1 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"  ‚óè   efefef;\\"1  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"1 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"  ‚óè   efefef;\\"1  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"1 align=left  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  f3e6d7;\\"  ffc;\\"   ‚óè  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"1  efefef;\\"0 } ===Titles won by nation=== {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:90% - !width=30Total !width=200Nation !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef !width=37 bgcolor=#efefef - align=center  efefef;\\"35 align=left  f3e6d7;\\" 3  f3e6d7;\\" 2  f3e6d7;\\" 1  ffc;\\" 1  15  13  efefef;\\"19  efefef;\\"15  efefef;\\"1 - align=center  efefef;\\"14 align=left  f3e6d7;\\" 0  f3e6d7;\\" 1  f3e6d7;\\" 2  ffc;\\" 0  3  8  efefef;\\"3  efefef;\\"9  efefef;\\"2 - align=center  efefef;\\"6 align=left  f3e6d7;\\" 1  f3e6d7;\\" 0  f3e6d7;\\" 0  ffc;\\" 0  1  4  efefef;\\"2  efefef;\\"4  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"4 align=left  f3e6d7;\\" 0  f3e6d7;\\" 1  f3e6d7;\\" 0  ffc;\\" 0  0  3  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"4  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"3 align=left  f3e6d7;\\" 0  f3e6d7;\\" 3  f3e6d7;\\" 0  ffc;\\" 0  0  0  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"3  efefef;\\"0 - align=center  efefef;\\"1 align=left  f3e6d7;\\" 0  f3e6d7;\\" 0  f3e6d7;\\" 0  ffc;\\" 0  1  0  efefef;\\"1  efefef;\\"0  efefef;\\"0 } ==See also== * 1972 World Championship Tennis circuit * 1972 Grand Prix tennis circuit ==References *Women's Tennis Association (WTA) official website *International Tennis Federation (ITF) official website Virginia Slims Circuit Category:WTA Tour seasons ","title":"1972 Women's Tennis Circuit"},{"id":"35831047","text":"The Spectacle Island Game Sanctuary is a protected area in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, Canada.

During the latter he commanded the 16th Infantry Brigade in North Africa and the Middle East, and later commanded the 26th Indian Infantry Division in the Burma Campaign, gaining the approval of Field Marshal Sir William Slim. ==Early life and First World War== Born in Kings Norton, Birmingham, on 28 June 1893, the eldest of three sons of Daniel Alexander Napier Lomax and Emma Annette Morris, Cyril Lomax was educated at Marlborough College and attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Welch Regiment in September 1912. He was posted to the regiment's 2nd Battalion, then serving in Bordon, Hampshire, as part of the 3rd Brigade, part of Major-General Samuel Lomax's 1st Division. Shortly after the First World War began Lomax's battalion, along with the rest of the division, was sent to France, arriving at Le Havre on 14 August. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 November 1914, and served with his battalion throughout 1915 and 1916. In August 1916, by which time he had been awarded the Military Cross, Lomax was appointed second in command of a 20th (Service) Battalion, Manchester Regiment, a Kitchener's Army unit, with the rank of temporary Major. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel in June 1917 to command the battalion. He was mentioned in despatches five times throughout the war. ==Between the wars== Having been awarded the Distinguished Service Order during his period in command, Lomax left the 21st Battalion of the Manchester Regiment in June 1919 and reverted from the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel to his substantive rank of captain. In December 1919 he was appointed adjutant of the Welch Regiment. In April 1923, he relinquished his appointment as adjutant of the 3rd battalion and returned to his regiment and in March 1924 was appointed adjutant of the 6th battalion The Welch Regiment. In March 1928 Lomax finished his spell as adjutant of the 6th Battalion The Welch Regiment. In November 1932, Lomax was promoted to Major and in January 1935 he was made a brevet lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1936 and given command of the 2nd Battalion The Welch Regiment in India. From March to October 1938, Lomax also commanded of the Delhi Independent Brigade Area with a local rank of brigadier. Lomax was promoted full colonel in July 1939 and was also given command of 16th Infantry Brigade, taking over from Brigadier John Evetts, in Palestine, during the final stages of the Arab revolt in Palestine, with the temporary rank of brigadier. ==Second World War== In September 1940, a year after the Second World War began, Lomax's brigade was sent to Egypt to join Western Desert Force. For Operation Compass in December the brigade was attached to the Indian 4th Infantry Division which had been short a brigade. They saw action in a successful attack on the Italian positions at Sidi Barrani. In mid- December the 4th Indian Division was sent to East Africa and 16th Brigade most of the ensuing period in reserve until mid February when it was withdrawn back to Egypt to join the reforming 6th Infantry Division. For his services from December 1940 to February 1941 Lomax was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The 16th Brigade was ordered forward in mid June 1941 as reinforcement to the forces advancing north against Vichy-controlled Syria and Lebanon. They experienced hard fighting until the Vichy surrender on 11 July. In September, the 70th Infantry Division (the re-designated 6th Division) was shipped to Tobruk to replace the besieged 9th Australian Division. During Operation Crusader the brigade's battalions were involved in the break-out from Tobruk to link with the New Zealand Division on the night of 26 November. However, a permanent relief of Tobruk was not achieved until a week later. In February 1942, 70th Division was ordered to India. The 16th Brigade set off in March but following the fall of Singapore, the Royal Navy's most important remaining base in the East at Trincomalee in Ceylon was felt to be under threat from the Japanese and the brigade was diverted to Ceylon where it was attached to 34th Indian Infantry Division. Lomax was appointed Fortress Commander in June 1942 and given the rank of acting Major-General in July. In March 1943, Lomax travelled to India to take command of 26th Indian Infantry Division. He was immediately ordered to the Arakan to replace Major-General Lloyd who had incurred the Army commander's displeasure (Noel Irwin). Part of the problem had been that after an encouraging start the campaign had gone into reverse and Irwin had committed more and more brigades until Lloyd's divisional headquarters had ended up with nine brigades under command, far too many to control effectively. Finally Irwin introduced Indian XV Corps HQ under William Slim to take control. By 8 May after heavy fighting the British were back to the point they had started at the previous December but the front had been stabilised. Slim later wrote of Lomax: In October 1943, Slim was made commander of Fourteenth Army and Lomax spent a month as an acting lieutenant general in charge of XV Corps pending the arrival of the new commander, Philip Christison. When the Japanese launched their HA-GO offensive in February 1944, Indian XV Corps had Indian 5th and 7th Infantry Divisions forward with 36th Infantry Division and Lomax's Indian 26th Infantry Division pulled back in reserve. The Japanese tactic was to infiltrate to cut off the forward divisions' line of supply and so force their capitulation. Army commander Slim had anticipated this and ordered that the forward divisions should fight where they stood and be supplied by air. Meanwhile, the reserve divisions were to fight their way forward and so crush the Japanese between them. By mid March, the 26th Indian Division, with responsibility for the eastern half of the front, had linked up with 7th Indian Division. Heavy fighting continued as XV Corps strove to take the important Maundaw-Buthidaung road. Finally, on 5 May, Lomax's division captured Point 551, the key hill, to seal the victory. Lomax's rank of Major-General was made substantive in December 1944. In January 1945, Lomax was given the task of capturing Ramree Island. After landing two brigades on the north end of the island on 21 and 22 January, they had fought their way south to Ramree town by 9 February and resistance ceased by 17 February. Having commanded his division for two years, Lomax was rested and saw no further action before the war came to an end. ==Post-war== Returning to the UK Lomax became GOC East Anglian District. His final assignment was as President of the No.1 Commissions Board, relinquishing the appointment in August 1949 and retiring from the army the following month.

It was published by Harper and Brothers in 1902 in New York, New York. It tells the story of a young boy named Pony Baker who, throughout the book, attempts to run away from his home where he lives with his mother, father, and five sisters. The setting of the story is \\"fifty years ago\\" in the Boy's Town of Ohio, the state where Howells was born and raised. == Plot summary == The story begins with Frank Baker, who is known as \\"Pony\\" after one of the boys in Boy's Town calls him by that name, so that he could be distinguished from his cousin Frank Baker. Pony lives in the Boy's Town with his mother, father, and five sisters, whom his mother always wants him to play with. Pony's mother is very overprotective of Pony, which makes her a bad mother when it comes to having fun. Pony's father has done some things that have given Pony the right to run away as well, but it seems to Pony that they were mostly things that his mother had put his father up to, and that his father would not have been half as bad if his mother had not influenced him. One day however, Pony almost loses all his patience after the way his father reacts to Pony being pushed down from third reader to second reader at school. That morning, Pony is asked by his teacher to read to the class, but because it is hot and because Pony was being lazy, he read very poorly despite the fact that Pony is actually a very good reader. His performance causes the teacher to push him down to the second reader. Before class is dismissed, Pony gathers his books and walks out of school towards home. His father advises him to go back to school that afternoon, which continues to upset Pony. Pony heads back to school that afternoon with a plan to run off as soon as school is over. At recess the boys hear word of Pony's plan to run away that very night. After school, the boys tell Pony how he must run away and how they will help him. An older boy named Jim Leonard suggests that Pony go with the Indians and that the Indians would like him and then adopt him into their tribe. Jim offers to find out if there are any Indians living nearer that the reservation that is about 100 miles away from the Boy's Town. === Jim Leonard's Hair-Breadth Escape === Jim Leonard lives with his mother on a rise of ground near the river in a log cabin while his stable sits on the flat by the water. One year in the spring, a freshet comes about that is the worse anyone can remember. Jim spends all day on the bank with the men watching the bridge. Jim plans to stay up all night with the old men, but realizes there is nothing for him to do, so he goes home. When Jim gets home, he is concerned with whether or not his mother will be awake to whip him for being gone all day and missing supper. He decides to go to the stable-loft and falls asleep. Jim wakes up to the daylight and realizes that the flood has torn the stable apart and left him floating on the roof in the water. The current quickly pulls Jim, the roof, and a rat that is on the roof out into the middle of the river where he begins to yell for help at the houses on the shore. At that moment, the bridge begins to rush towards him. Jim continues to yell for help until both fire companies arrive. At this point, Jim decides to name the rat Bolivar, and that he will save it and keep it as a pet. Fireman Blue Bob is able to grab the roof when it breaks apart and saves Jim Leonard, but the rat falls into the water. Blue Bob says that he never saw a rat on the roof with Jim and many other people say that there never was a rat on the roof with Jim, and that he made it up. === The Scrape That Jim Leonard Got the Boys Into === Late in the summer of that same year Jim tells Pony Baker and the boys that he knows of a watermelon patch that the owner had no use for, and the other boys demand to know where it is. Jim tells them that the patch belongs to Bunty Williams and he dares the boys to come with him to get melons. The boys set off with Jim to the watermelon patch on a sunny morning in September. On their trip through the river and the woods, Jim begins to hesitate and act as though he does not want to show the boys where the watermelon patch is. The boys encourage him to keep going and offer to help him get there when he begins to complain of a toothache. Finally, Jim rushes ahead of the boys to the patch that is about the size of an acre. The boys begin to praise Jim for leading them to the patch, but he does not participate in eating the melons and looks on while complaining of a toothache. While the boys break open the melons, Pony does not take any of them. For some reason, Pony thinks it looks wrong to take and eat them from the patch. So, Pony stands off to the side and Jim stands there with him while they watch the rest of the boys enjoy themselves. Pony then thinks he sees someone come out of Bunty Williams' house, which is half a mile away, with a dog and a hoe in their hand. Pony makes Jim look and Jim shrieks that it is Bunty with a dog and a gun. The boys immediately run towards the woods as if Bunty had caught them stealing his melons. The boys reach the river and run through to the other side, but Jim Leonard is missing. The boys reach the shore and begin to brag about what they would have done if Bunty had caught them and what they would do to Jim if he were with them. Pony begins to be afraid that the boys would hurt Jim Leonard if they found him. Pony decides to walk home and leaves the boys behind kindling a fire to dry their clothes, which are wet from the river. Pony then climbs the riverbank and finds Jim hiding in a hole peering down at the other boys. Jim is crying and complaining of his toothache. He is afraid to go home and get beaten by his mother. Jim and Pony leave to buy some crackers and apples to eat and go down to a pump where they drink water until they are full. They run back to the riverbank where the other boys cannot see them and build a fire of their own and bake some potatoes. As Jim begins to tell stories of Indians, Pony wonders why Bunty would have chased them if he had given up the watermelon patch, but never gets the chance to ask Jim. Pony begins to feel very sick and asks Jim to help him get home. Jim asks Pony not to tell his parents of what happened today and Pony agrees. When Pony gets home, his mother finds out what happened at the watermelon patch and that Jim Leonard put the boys up to it. The doctor comes and makes Pony feel better. The chapter ends with Pony's mother wishing that there were no such boy as Jim Leonard in the Boy's Town. === About Running Away to the Indian Reservation on a Canal-Boat, and How the Plan Failed === As much as his mother hated Jim Leonard, Pony likes Jim and believes everything that Jim has said in spite of what had happened at the watermelon patch. Jim finds out that the closest Indian reservation is close to Lake Erie and that the best way to get there was by canal-boat. Pony does not like the idea of living so long among the Indians that he would not remember his father and mother when he would see them again, but does not tell Jim for fear of being made fun of. The next morning at school the boys hear word that Pony is planning to run away on a canal-boat to see the Indians. The boys tell Pony that he should use Piccolo Wright's father's boat to go to the reservation. The boys go to the boat and plan to travel with Pony at night and walk home. The fellows then here a shout from afar and know it to be Piccolo's father. They all run away as fast as they can and reason that they should not use the boat in fear of getting in trouble with Piccolo's father. === How the Indians Came to the Boy's Town and Jim Leonard Acted the Coward === A group of Indians come through the Boy's Town while being moved out west by the government. The boys are excited by the arrival of the Indians and Jim tries to persuade Pony to run away with them. Pony does not want to tell Jim that he has pretty much given up the idea of running away. Things at home had gotten much better since the incident with Piccolo's father, which causes Pony to want to stay home. Jim continues to try and persuade Pony to go with the Indians until a stray arrow skims Jim's foot. Pony helps Jim home and decides against running away with the Indians and about gives up the idea of running away altogether. He has a great Fourth of July and begins to think about his cousin Frank's story about the Fourth of July a year before. === How Frank Baker Spent the Fourth at Pawpaw Bottom, and Saw the Fourth of July Boy === Jake Milrace rides up to Frank while he is sawing wood for his mother. He asks Frank to come with him to Dave Black's house for the Fourth of July. His mother allows him to go and the two ride off together to Dave's house. When they get to Dave's, his parents do not appear to have been expecting their arrival. Dave is out in the pasture hauling rails and the boys help him throughout the heat of the day. After dinner and work, the three boys head to the swimming hole in the creek. The boys stop to eat berries out of a mulberry tree on their way. While in the tree, a light flashes into Frank' eyes and blinds him. Dave yells out at a boy in the cornfield, who had shined the light, but the boy disappears into the woods and the boys keep eating. The boys then head to the swimming hole when a thunderstorm strikes while they are on the edge of the woods. The boys decided to take off their clothes and take a shower-bath and begin to play Indians. Jake then yells at the same boy, a naked white figure, that they had seen earlier, but Frank explains that there is no other boy besides the three of them. Jake then claims to see the boy again in the barn door of the barn they are playing around. Again, the other boys do not see him. Jake then claims to see the boy again before he disappears into the woods. The storm clears out and the boys decide they no longer want to go swimming and decide to build a raft instead. While in the water, the raft gets stuck and causes Dave to fall into the water as well as the other boys who almost fall right on top of Dave. Frank gets caught in a tree at the bottom of the water and claims to have seen the same boy under water surrounded by light, but the other two did not see him. The boys spend the afternoon playing castaway sailors on the raft. Frank and Jake eventually grab their horses and head back to the Boy's Town. When they get to Frank's house, Frank's mother feeds them baked chicken and bread. The two then go out and tell of the boys about their time at Pawpaw. While watching fireworks, Frank tells his story to his mother, Pony, and Pony's father about the boy at Pawpaw who tricked them all day. The chapter closes with Pony's mother and father arguing about whether or not the Fourth of July boy at Pawpaw had really been seen by the three boys that day. === How Pony Baker Came Pretty Near Running Off With the Circus === Right before the circus comes to town at the end of July, Pony's mother and father are walking home and Pony throws a snowball at his mother's head as a light joke. While Pony laughs, his mother grabs him and boxes his ears. His mother begins to cry and her reaction causes Pony to cry too because he did not mean to frighten his mother. This makes Pony want to run away again. On the morning of the circus the boys watch the circus procession at the corporation line. Later that day, Pony helps carry water to the circus horses when a circus man approaches him. Jim Leonard speaks to the man on behalf of Pony and says that Pony wants to join the circus. The man tells Pony to wait on his doorstep at one o'clock in the morning and the circus procession will pick him up. === How Pony Did Not Quite Get Off With the Circus === Jim Leonard tells all the boys how Pony is going to run off. That night, Pony's father takes him and his sisters to the circus. His mother and father are very nice to him and this makes Pony's heart ache when he thinks about leaving them. After supper, Jim Leonard comes over and helps Pony pack his belongings. Pony gets into bed early and his mother comes to see him and apologizes for boxing his ears. Pony begins to cry and wraps his arms around her neck. Pony eventually falls asleep and wakes up to the sound of the circus band. He gets dressed as quickly as possible and rushes to his front steps where he sees the circus magician. Pony tries to get back into the house, so the magician cannot find him. As he reaches for the doorknob there is no door there. Pony curls into a ball in hopes that the magician will not see him. Then his father and the doctor are standing by him looking down at him. The doctor claims Pony has been walking in his sleep. Pony wakes up finding it to be morning. Pony is relieved that the circus is so far away, but becomes ill for two or three days. Pony is never actually sure if he waited on the front steps that night and seen the circus magician or not. Jim Leonard tries to help him figure out if it was a dream or not. Jim tells Pony that he wishes he had not overslept, so that he could have come said good-bye to Pony, like he said he would. === The Adventures that Pony's Cousin, Frank Baker, Had with A Pocketful of Money === Pony likely would have never tried to run off again had it not been for Jim Leonard. His mother never liked Jim and always wanted Pony to go off with his cousin Frank. Pony wanted to ask Frank whether or not he should run away, but was ashamed to ask Frank, especially after hearing the story of how Frank delivered $2,000 from the city to the Boy's Town. When Frank was eleven, he went into the city with his mother, who was leaving to go on Frank's uncle's boat to see his grandmother along with his sisters. While in the city, a merchant from the Boy's Town needs to give $2,000 to someone who is going back home to send to his partner. When the merchant finds that Frank is going back, he stuffs the money into Frank's pocket for him to deliver. On the way home, Frank's carriage is damaged and he and his brother are forced to stay 16 miles away from home for the night. A bad thunderstorm occurs that night and Frank does not sleep because he wants to protect the money and make sure his sleeping brother is safe and breathing. Frank eventually falls into a deep sleep and does not wake up till daytime the next day and finally reaches home. Frank leaves his house after supper to take the money to the merchant's partner in town. He gives the money to the merchant's partner, he counts it, and Frank heads back home to see his father sitting on the front porch. His father tells Frank that people who have large amounts of money seem to care more for it than they do their own brothers, and they believe the things that money can buy are more precious than the things it cannot. His father then tells him to get some rest. === How Jim Leonard Planned For Pony Baker To Run Off On a Raft === It is September when Jim tells Pony that he should run off again, and that if Pony did he would run off too. The plan is to take the boards off the shanty in the woods and build a raft and float down to the city. When schools starts, Jim and Pony are great friends and ask the teacher if they can sit next to each other at school. After school, the two hang out in the hay-loft of Pony's barn. Jim persuades Pony that they are going to need to hide provisions for when they sneak away. The first day, Jim eats the food that Pony brings and the next day, Pony's dog Trip eats the food that Jim brings. Jim tells Pony that he must train Trip not to follow him into the barn. Pony then spends time teaching Trip not to do so. It makes Pony's heart ache to do this to Trip, but he had to do it because Jim Leonard said so. They continue to eat the provisions that they had stored in the hay. Jim then tells Pony that he must leave first and that Jim will follow him as soon as the river rises. Pony does not like the idea because he thinks Jim is backing out. The plan is for Pony to sleep next Friday in the barn and to leave early the next morning. Everyone afternoon from then on Pony brings bread-and-butter with meat and hides it in the hay while Jim would bring eggs to store as well. Friday comes and Jim tells Pony that he will sleep in the barn with Pony that night and help send him off the morning. The two dig out the provisions and find there are chickens in the eggs and the meat has gone bad. Jim tells Pony that if he cannot stay with Pony that night that he will come at six the next morning to wake Pony and send him off. === How Jim Leonard Backed Out, and Pony Had to Give Up === Pony finds Jim's constant changing of the plans to run off very odd, but does not say anything in fear of being called a cowardly-calf. Pony does not want to run off but does not see how he can help it. On Friday, Pony looks at Trip while he is standing at the barn doors and rushes towards the house to catch Trip who runs and jumps into his arms. His mother calls him in and asks why Pony is acting so quiet. She then asks if it is because Pony had a falling out with Jim Leonard and comments that she does not care for the boy. At that moment, Pony realizes he does not like Jim very much himself. Pony sneaks out that night to the barn with the lantern in his hand. When Pony gets to the loft, rats seem to swarm around him, but do not bother him. Pony is not able to fall asleep and soon begins to cry. As Pony's mother gets ready for bed, she realizes that Pony is not in his bed and that the lantern is missing. Pony's father heads into town to search for Pony, but none of the older boys had seen him, but say that Jim Leonard may know where he is. Pony's father goes to Jim's house, but his mother explains that he has been asleep for hours. He returns home and searches the house with Pony's mother who expects that the worse has happened to Pony. Finally, Pony's father goes out to the barn and hears Pony sobbing. Pony's father brings Pony back to the house where his mother holds him and kisses him while she cries. Pony explains to his mother what Jim Leonard had put him up to. At daybreak Pony's father remembers that he left his candle out in the barn when he was searching for Pony and he rushes out to get it in hopes that the barn has not burned down. While at the barn, he sees Jim Leonard sneaking towards the barn door. Pony's father pounces on Jim, grabs him by the collar, and takes Jim home where he tells his mother how he put Pony up to sneaking away. Pony gets sick for a week and his father talks with him and asks why Pony would want to run away from his home where they all love him so much. Pony explains how miserable he would have been had he run away from home and hopes that it will serve as a lesson for him. It also serves as a lesson for Pony's parents, who let Pony do more things and his mother does not baby him so much. Pony thinks this is because she is trying to be a better mother to him and, possibly, she does not baby him so much because Pony has a newborn baby brother for his mother to worry about instead, a brother who was born a week after Pony tried to run off. ==Main characters== *Frank \\"Pony\\" Baker: the main character of the story. He is a young boy who is little, dark, and round, with a thick crop of black hair. Nicknamed \\"Pony,\\" so he would not be confused with his cousin of the same name. *Pony's mother: Pony's overprotective mother whose actions demonstrate that she thinks Pony is too little to take care of himself. *Pony's father: Pony's father whose actions towards Pony often seem to be things that Pony's mother puts him up to. *Jim Leonard: Pony's closest friend in the story who continually attempts to persuade Pony to run away from home. *Frank Baker: Pony's cousin who is a responsible and kind young man. He often takes great care of his younger brothers and younger boys in the Boy's Town. Pony's mother tries to get Pony to spend time with Frank instead of with Jim Leonard. *Jim Leonard's mother == Themes == Throughout the book Pony plans, and is persuaded to plan, ideas of running away from his family and home. Before and after each time Pony attempts to run away, he realizes how caring and loving his family is. By the end of the book, he realizes that the things that made him want to run away are like nothing to him now and that if he had not been at home he would be miserable. The book demonstrates that even though occurrences at our homes make us mad at times, they are nothing that should make us want to leave our families because we belong in our homes with the ones we love. In addition, the book points that parents are better mothers and fathers when they do not baby their children. Rather, they should allow their children to grow and become independent individuals. The Flight of Pony Baker is autobiographical both in its use of incidents from Howells's own boyhood and in its reflection of his mature understanding of how those incidents had formed a psychological pattern‚Äîone that Freud would certainly have called a 'nuclear complex.' Indeed, Howells shows an intuitive knowledge not only of 'Oedipal' fears and desires, but of the psychological process by which a boy moves beyond them into the 'latency period.' In a Freudian sense, the 'flight' of Pony Baker, who is nine years old, may be interpreted as an escape from the turmoil of early childhood psychosexuality. Literally, the 'flight'‚Äîwhich never actually happens‚Äîrefers to Pony's recurrent urge to run away from home; and the novel opens with two chapters about 'why he had a right to run off' because of his parents', and especially his mother's, mistreatment of him. Pony's na√Øve complaints mask a deeper conflict between his 'savage' impulses and his mother's 'civilizing' rules, which she imposes upon him directly and also indirectly by prevailing upon Pony's lenient father to support her. The rewards for Pony's resolution at the conclusion of the story are the prerogatives of growing up. Pony finds, to his pleasure, that his parents 'let him do more things,' and that his mother does not 'baby him so much before the boys.' Having become 'civilized,' he can now be trusted. Having repressed his boyish self, as figured in the \\"low down\\" Jim Leonard, Pony is ready to model himself on his manly namesake, cousin Frank Baker, who is 'one of those fellows that every mother would feel her boy was safe with.' Like the other boy-book boys, Pony Baker moves from the 'savage' into the 'civilized' realm. == The Boy Book == \\"Credit for recognizing the boy book as a type is usually given to W.D. Howells, who observed in his review of Aldrich that 'no one else seems to have thought of telling the story of a boy's life, with so great desire to show what a boy's life is, and so little purpose of teaching what it should be.' Five years later Howells steered Mark Twain toward the conception of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) as 'a book for boys, pure & simple.'\\" Howells later contributed to the subgenre of realism with A Boy's Town (1890) and The Flight of Pony Baker (1902). == Relationship with Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer == \\"Jim Leonard, the mischievous friend of Howells' protagonist, has been correctly described as 'a cross between Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn'; and there is no mistaking the genesis of such chapters as 'How Jim Leonard Planned for Pony Baker to Run Off on a Raft.' But Jim is an anti-hero‚Äîa coward and a bully whose escape plans always fail, who leaves Pony in a lurch, and who faces humiliation when he is spanked by his mother. The 'strange thing,' comments the narrator, '‚Ä¶was that he could have such a boy as Pony Baker under him so' (77). Jim's foil, the good Frank Baker, is presented as a role model (166), not as a figure of fun like Tom's brother Sid.\\" == Notes  External links  References == * * * Howells, William Dean.

In 1966, Annie Gautrat (Stone) was taking part in the \\"Miss Beatnik\\" competition where √âric Charden was a member of the jury. They were acquainted after the competition and got married the same year. Already having separate musical careers, they decided to form the duo known as Stone et Charden in 1971. They became hugely popular with \\"L'Avventura\\" in 1972 and with \\"Made in Normandie\\" in 1973. \\"L'Aventura\\" sold over one and a half million copies and was awarded a gold disc. Soon artistic, mediatic and family tensions resulted in a divorce and break-up of the duo with each member pursuing a separate sole musical career. The two came for a reunion in 1990 with some releases and remakes. They also took part in 4th annual \\"√Çge tendre et T√™tes de bois\\" tour in 2009-2010.

The derby is also sometimes referred to as the Belfast derby. They are the two most successful and most supported clubs in Northern Irish Football. They traditionally face each other on Boxing Day each year which usually attracts the largest Irish Premiership attendance of the season. They regularly play each other in the league, and have contested more cup finals together than any other two clubs. They also make up two of the three clubs (along with Cliftonville) that have competed in every season of the Irish League's top flight since its inception in 1890 ‚Äì neither club ever suffering relegation. Although Linfield and Glentoran have been the two most successful clubs in the domestic game to date, Linfield has won all three of the current major domestic trophies more than any other club. They have won more than twice as many league titles as their rivals, with Linfield having won 53 league titles to Glentoran's 23. Linfield has also lifted the Irish Cup a record 43 times to Glentoran's 22, and has won the League Cup a record 10 times to Glentoran's seven. ==History== The term \\"Big Two\\" did not always refer to Linfield and Glentoran. Up until 1949, the big two were considered to be Linfield and Belfast Celtic as they had traditionally been the most successful teams in Northern Irish football. Given the traditional political following of both clubs (Linfield, like Glentoran, with a mainly unionist following, and Belfast Celtic with a mainly nationalist following), sectarian violence between supporters of both clubs was common. This culminated with a riot on 26 December 1948 at Windsor Park that saw three Celtic players injured by Linfield supporters, including striker Jimmy Jones who sustained a broken leg. Belfast Celtic left the Irish League at the end of the season and Glentoran became Linfield's biggest rivals. Both teams are predominantly Protestant; however, Glentoran has fielded Catholic players and had Catholic fans for much of its history. Linfield fielded relatively few Catholic players prior to the 1980s, which led to an accusation that the club held a policy of not signing Catholic players ‚Äì similar to Scottish team, Rangers. However, the existence of such a policy has been disputed by some, including well-known local journalist Malcolm Brodie. Support is traditionally split geographically with Linfield based in the south of the city and Glentoran in the east. Although both based in Belfast, they are separated by the River Lagan and are in two different counties. Linfield is based in County Antrim and Glentoran is based in County Down, although Glentoran and other County Down-based sides compete in the County Antrim Shield. The first game of which there is any record between Linfield and Glentoran took place on 1 October 1887. A friendly match played at King's Field, Westbourne in Ballymacarrett was won 3‚Äì1 by Linfield (then known as Linfield Athletic), with goalscorers Torrans (2) and Vance, and Glentoran's goalscorer unknown. The two teams played each other competitively for the first time in the inaugural Irish League season, with Linfield winning 7‚Äì0 at Musgrave Park on 18 October 1890, and 6‚Äì0 at Ulsterville Avenue on 21 March 1891. The first game at The Oval took place on 8 October 1892, and the first game at Windsor Park on 2 September 1905. Linfield previously played at a ground in Ulsterville Avenue, Belfast, before moving to Windsor Park, which is situated within walking distance of their old ground. Also the home of the Northern Ireland national football team, they have played at Windsor Park ever since. In 1941, during World War II, The Oval ‚Äì including terraces, offices, kits and club records ‚Äì was destroyed in a bombing raid on the nearby Harland & Wolff Shipyard. Glentoran approached Distillery to play at Grosvenor Park, which they did until The Oval was rebuilt in 1949, with help from other Irish League clubs, most notably Distillery and Cliftonville. Glentoran considered leaving senior football to become a junior club, but after being lent kits from Distillery and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, they were only victorious over Linfield on one occasion.http://www.glentoran-fc.co.uk/oval%20history.htm Since Belfast Celtic folded in 1949, the intensity of the Big Two rivalry has increased due to the fact that Glentoran has been the only club that has generated a support base similar in size to Linfield's, and because a number of Belfast Celtic fans started to support Glentoran due to the dissolution of their club. In the 1985 Irish Cup final at the Oval, Glentoran supporters released a cockerel (Glentoran's club emblem), and a pig that had been painted blue onto the pitch to insult fans of Linfield. In 2005, Linfield fans broke through a gate in perimeter fencing onto the pitch of The Oval and threw missiles at Glentoran fans in the main stand.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/4477177.stm The BBC and Ulster Television were ordered to give police footage they had filmed of the game after 9 fans were charged with the violence. 9 police officers and 2 Glentoran fans were injured in the violence.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4563397.stm Both sides share rivalries with North Belfast clubs Cliftonville and Crusaders. The two however are less successful than the Big Two and see each other as their main rivals, contesting the North Belfast derby. They also both traditionally shared a rivalry with Lisburn Distillery, but since Distillery's relocation from Grosvenor Park to Lisburn, and their downturn in on-pitch fortunes, the rivalry has ebbed. ==Trophy dominance== Linfield and Glentoran have been the two most successful clubs in Northern Irish football to date, regularly being the two main contenders for the major domestic honours. They have won more league titles, Irish Cups, and League Cups than any other clubs. Linfield hold the record for the most League titles (53), Irish Cups (43), and League Cups (10). In comparison, Glentoran have won 23 league titles, 22 Irish Cups, and 7 League Cups. Almost half (46.8%) of the 139 Irish Cup competitions to date have been won by one of the two clubs, with at least one of the clubs reaching the final on 90 occasions (64.7% of all finals), winning the cup a combined 65 times. Of those 90 finals, the two clubs have met in 15 of them ‚Äì making it the most common final. Linfield have won eight of the head-to-head final meetings compared to Glentoran's seven wins, with the most recent final meeting between the two clubs occurring in the 2006 final, when Linfield won 2‚Äì1 to lift the Cup for the 37th time. Almost two-thirds (64.4%) of all Irish League titles have been won by one of the Big Two. Of the 118 completed league seasons, the title has been won by either club on 76 occasions. The duo also make up two of the three clubs that have appeared in every season of the Irish League since its inception in 1890; the other club being Cliftonville. ===Statistics=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align: center;\\" ! width=\\"60\\"Winner ! width=\\"80\\"League ! width=\\"80\\"Irish Cup ! width=\\"80\\"League Cup ! width=\\"80\\"Co.

Tuned exhausts are designed so that reflected pressure waves arrive at the exhaust port at a particular time in the combustion cycle. ==Two-stroke engines Expansion chambers === Exhaust system for a motor scooter with an expansion chamber in the middle section (inlet is shown at the top right of the picture and muffler/outlet is above the expansion chamber). In two-stroke engines where the exhaust port is opened by being uncovered by the piston (rather than by a separate valve), a tuned exhaust system usually consists of an expansion chamber. The expansion chamber is designed to produce a negative pressure wave to assist in filling the cylinder with the next intake charge, and then to produce a positive pressure wave which reduces the amount of fresh intake charge that escapes through the exhaust port (port blocking). === Uniflow scavenging === An alternate design of two-stroke engines is where the exhaust port is opened/closed using a poppet valve and the intake port is piston- controlled (opened by being uncovered by the piston). The timing of the exhaust valve closure is designed to assist in filling the cylinder with the next intake charge (as per four-stroke engines). An opposed piston engine uses uniflow scavenging, however this design uses piston-controlled cylinder ports with one piston controlling the inlet port and the other the exhaust port. Similarly, split-single engines use uniflow scavenging, with the piston in one cylinder controlling the transfer port (where the intake mixture enters the cylinder) and the other piston controls the exhaust port. ==Four-stroke engines== Aftermarket extractor manifold In a four-stroke engine, an exhaust manifold which is designed to maximise the power output of an engine is often called \\"extractors\\" or \\"headers\\". The pipe lengths and merging locations are designed to assist in filling the cylinder with the next intake charge using exhaust scavenging.The Design and Tuning of Competition Engines, Philip H. Smith, pp137-138 Locations where exhaust pipes from individual cylinders merge together are called \\"collectors\\". The diameters of the exhaust system are designed to minimise back-pressure by optimising the gas velocity. Extractors/headers usually have equal length pipes for each cylinder, whereas a more basic exhaust manifold may have unequal length pipes.

The layout of a 4-2-1 system is as follows: four pipes (primary) come off the cylinder head, and merge into two pipes (secondary), which in turn finally link up to form one collector pipe. Compared with a 4-1 exhaust system, a 4-2-1 often produces more power at mid-range engine speeds (RPM), while a 4-1 exhaust produces more power at high RPM. === Cylinder pairings === The purpose of a 4-2-1 exhaust system is to increase scavenging by merging the exhaust paths of spectific pairs of cylinders. Therefore, the cylinder pairings are defined by the intervals between firing events, which is determined by the firing order and‚Äî for engines with an unevenly spaced firing order‚Äî the firing interval. For an inline-four engine with a typical firing order of 1-3-4-2, pairing cylinders 1 & 4 and cylinders 2 & 3 is considered \\"non-sequential\\", since the paired cylinders do not follow each other in the firing order. This non-sequential arrangement results in an even spacing of 360 degrees between the firing interval in each cylinder pair. A sequential pairing would result in uneven spacings, such as 180 degrees and 540 degrees for pairings of cylinders 1 & 2 and 3 & 4\\\\. This sequential pairing is used by many motorcycle engines. For a V8 engine with a typical crossplane design, 4-2-1 exhausts are often called \\"Tri-Y\\" exhausts. Traditionally, only cylinders within the same bank were paired, resulting in spacings of 90-630 degrees (sequential), 180-540 degrees or 270-450 degrees. Typically, the 270 interval is favoured, requiring different pairings in each bank; e.g. 1 & 2 and 3 & 4 in one bank, but 1 & 3 and 2 & 4 in the other - naturally such exhausts are sensitive to the specific firing order in use. Even spacings of 360-360 degrees are only possible if a cross-over exhaust manifold is used to pair cylinders from separate banks. === Pipe lengths === The combining of exhaust pressure pulses from each cylinder dictates the lengths of the pipes necessary. Generally, longer pipes will help produce more power at higher engine rpm, and shorter pipes favour low-rpm torque, thereby altering the power band. However, the gases tend to cool as they pass through longer pipes, which reduces the effectiveness of the catalytic converter. In a turbocharged engine, the key factor in the length of the exhaust pipes is providing evenly- spaced pressure pulses to the turbine of the turbocharger. ==See also== Two- stroke engines * Expansion chamber * Exhaust pulse pressure charging * Kadenacy effect Four-stroke engines * Exhaust system * Exhaust manifold * Scavenging (automotive) * Pressure wave supercharger ==References== Category:Exhaust systems ","title":"Tuned exhaust"},{"id":"35831286","text":"Henry Tilney is the leading man in Jane Austen's 1817 novel Northanger Abbey. The younger son of a local landowner, Tilney is comfortably placed as a beneficed clergyman on his father's estate. ==Character== Tilney, with his teasing yet kind-hearted mentorship of Catherine, has been considered the nicest of Austen's heroes.G.

The Mitchell Center regularly invites leading visiting artists and creative thinkers from throughout the world to the UH campus to show their work, develop new projects, lead workshops, and teach courses. The Mitchell Center commissions and produces new works across the visual, performing, and literary arts. The center was founded in 2003 and forms an alliance among five departments at UH: the School of Art, the Moores School of Music, the School of Theatre and Dance, the Creative Writing Program, and the Blaffer Art Museum. ==History== The Mitchell Center was founded in fall 2003 as a collaborative force uniting the arts programs on the University of Houston campus. The Mitchell Center was founded with a contribution from philanthropist and business man, George P. Mitchell with the desire to impact the creative arts programs at UH in honor of his late wife, Cynthia Woods Mitchell, a strong lover of the arts throughout her life. The Mitchell family and UH worked closely together to create a program that would connect the schools of Art, Music, Theatre and Dance as well as Blaffer Museum and the UH Creative Writing Program. . An endowment of $20 million was given with $16 million designated for the programs and $4 million to renovate the School of Theatre and Dance facility, creating new studios, a lobby for the Wortham Theatre, and offices for the newly established Mitchell Center. The newly renovated building was renamed the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts. In December 2005, Karen Farber was hired as the first full-time director. . ==Residences and Special Projects== Mitchell Center invites artists for inter-disciplinary residencies on a semester basis. The residencies provide an opportunity for new and dynamic collaboration and vary in length and type based on the artist and the project. Projects can be research based, public art, academic, or part of a larger thematic initiative. Past artists include: Terry & Jo Harvey Allen Philip Glass Liz Lerman ETHEL Fritz Haeg Big Dance Theater The Art Guys Ronald K. Brown Negativland Dick Hebdige Mark Doty Joan Tower Center for Land Use Interpretation Marc Bamuthi Joseph SIMPARCH Jeremy Deller ==Education and the Interdisciplinary Art minor (IART)== In 2008, the Mitchell Center created a new minor called the Interdisciplinary Arts Minor (IART), which is available to UH students from all colleges and majors. IART courses are each sponsored by two or more UH departments and taught by a range of faculty and visiting scholars and practitioners. The minor includes academic study in the historic & contemporary examples of interdisciplinary arts and provides opportunities for students of all majors and academic fields to engage in interdisciplinary projects, utilizing the funding & resources of the Mitchell Center. Mitchell Center also supports an annual Curatorial Fellowship position at Blaffer Art Museum and offers annual scholarships to graduate students who are interested in cross-disciplinary collaboration and who are studying in the fields of Art, Creative Writing, Music, and Theatre. The Mitchell Center also hosts a series of lectures and conversations with renowned visitors (artists, writers, choreographers, academics, and musicians) to discuss how collaboration has influenced their artistic development. These conversations are meant to encourage communication about cross-disciplinary works and promote deeper engagement and exploration. In 2007, the Mitchell Center developed the Faculty Affiliate Network (FAN) to connect the arts with other areas of the UH campus. FAN is meant to create direct communication between visual artists, performers, and writers and colleagues of the UH faculty and staff for collaboration, dialogue, and sharing of expertise. ==See also== *Lacy M.

Ideological credo of Javid is revealed in the play, a mystic flaw is strongly expressed and the poet's thoughts about a problem of human's happiness followed by the imperialistic war are reflected in the poem. Initially the tragedy was staged in 1920, by Abbas Mirza Sharifzadeh. It is noted that, at the beginning of the 1920s the play had a great success. ‚ÄúIblis‚Äù is considered as the first verse play of Azerbaijan, which was put on the stage. It is also noted that the play is significant not only for its complex philosophic character, and also for a romantic style. The play was published in 1924, for the first time. Later, it was published in 1927, 1959, 1969, 1982, 2001 and 2005. In the Small Soviet Encyclopedia of 1931, the work was called a poem.

Azerbaijan State Academic Drama Theatre. 1922. Stage director Abbas Mirza Sharifzadeh Events take place in the Near East during World War I. Arif - the main hero of the play ‚Äì is very humane and romantic young man. With the help of Iblis image, Huseyn Javid created a character of people, who sell their souls to the devil for money. According to the author, souls of these people aren‚Äôt free, they are in captivity of the devil and the devil rules the souls of people, for whom the material welfare is considered the main stimulus. Arif was puzzled with occupational wars, violence of people, crime and betrayal, but by the grace of the God he sees the salvation of humanity, believes in his confluence with the free world. But, eventually Arif obeys to the Satan, becomes a murderer of his wife and brother and also becomes a greedy for gold and wealth. He could not only reunite with the dreamed world, but also became shabby. Arif, who lived with great ideas, couldn‚Äôt become higher than a simple man and finally drag out a miserable existence. ==History of staging== Abbas Mirza Sharifzadeh, the first actor of \\"Iblis\\" role For the first time, the play was put on the stage of the State Theatre on December 21, 1920 by Abbas Mirza Sharifzade. ‚ÄúIblis‚Äù is considered as the first verse drama of Azerbaijan, which was put on the stage. The first staging of ‚ÄúIblis‚Äù is considered as a significant event in the theatrical life of Azerbaijan. Then, the theatre used all available facilities in order to make a colorful romantic spectacle. Despite minor technical means, the theater achieved interesting views for war, fire scenes, effective disappearance and appearance of personages. A scene of feast in the last act was also very interesting. Ballet was broadly used in the play. Iblis‚Äôs piece was played by Sharifzade himself. Critics noted that this character created by Sharifzade, didn‚Äôt remind of the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù Mephistopheles at all. And whereas the poet was far from a presentation of the Devil‚Äôs appearance, which was typical for the Eastern folklore (where it was often described as blind in one eye). It is considered that Iblis created by Sharifzade was strict, magnificent, angry, embodying evil and revenge, spreading fear and confusion, was pathetic and ironic. And when Iblis assumed the aspect of human, the actor played a piece of an experienced old man, inclined to philosophic thoughts seeming humane, calling sympathy of surrounding him people. It is also noted that ‚Äúa romantic ardor, by which a quite complex philosophic subject matter of the play is revealed in the theatre‚Äù called ‚Äúwarm sympathy of the spectators‚Äù. In December, 1920 a premiere of the play was held in Tashkent with a staging of Uzbek State Troup in Azerbaijani. For the second time the tragedy was played in Azerbaijan State Drama Theatre a year later, in 1921, with that very staging. Then it was staged by such stage directors as Alexander Ivanov (in 1922) and Alexander Tuganov (in 1926). Theater expert Ilham Rahimli noted that these stagings had either positive or negative moments. Poster of the spectacle staged on May 26, 1922 in honor of Ismayil Hidayetzade and Aghasadyg Garaybeyli. Azerbaijan State Academic Drama Theatre Already in the first years of the Soviet power's existence, the play was translated into Uzbek language. In 1923, the play was staged in Uzbek language. It was noted that in 1921-1924's the play was staged in Uzbekistan by efforts of Hamza ‚Äì a cultural figure of Uzbekistan. Influence of this play on development of theatrical art in Uzbekistan and in other republics of Middle Asia was also mentioned. In 1924, the play was put on the stage in Tashkent. The last staging of the play, during the author's lifetime, was held in 1925. In 1983, while preparing for the 100th anniversary of Huseyn Javid, Azerbaijan State Academic Drama Theatre included ‚ÄúIblis‚Äù tragedy in their repertoire. Artistic council of the theatre entrusted the staging of the spectacle to Mehdi Mammadov. Mehdi mammadov's ‚ÄúIblis‚Äù possessed a philosophic and psychological depth. The spectacle was staged ‚Äúin a style of a synthesis of monumentalism and modernism‚Äù. The stage director showed the essence of the tragedy's subject matter on the basis of international political relations, because of which it is considered that the spectacle was ‚Äúoriginal, fresh, compositionally grandiose and majestic‚Äù. It was also noted that, an eternal conflict between good and evil, humanity and the Devil's home was expressed through Huseyn Javid's poetry. The Devil's home was expressed through a modern threat of atom and hydrogen bomb. Aydin Azimov's ‚Äúhorror influencing‚Äù music, which is based on tremolo string and ostinato beats of timpani, dissonances of woodwind and brass instruments of orchestra created panicky condition of humanity before the terrible. ==Analysis of the play== Huseyn Javid, author of the play As it was pointed out, in the play Huseyn Javid protests against devastating wars and their inspirers, unmasks rotten philosophy of non-resistance to evil, and also ‚Äúna√Øve hope of people for triumph of good beginning in the capitalistic world‚Äù. It is considered that the dram was written under a perceptible influence of Goethe‚Äôs ‚ÄúFaust‚Äù, but a literary critic Ali Nazim calls it ‚ÄúFaust‚Äôs‚Äù imitation. After publication Javid's drama was compared with Pushkin. In investigations of 1937, a tendentious character was given to its popularity; for instance, in B.V.Chobanzade‚Äôs work he is referred to Ali Nazim‚Äôs citation about Huseyn Javid as ‚Äúhe was the one of rare talents in the whole Soviet Union‚Äù. It is also considered that critics directed to anti- humanistic nature of imperialism were sounded in the dram. It is noted that humanistic ideas of the author were realized in Iblis's image ‚Äì an image of ‚Äúevil‚Äù, the unmasker of human's betrayals and crimes. Huseyn Javid denies a well-known belief about that ‚Äúthe devil is the source of all human troubles‚Äù in his work. The poet says, no, all misfortunes come from human's self- interest, from ‚Äúruthless kings‚Äù, ‚Äúemirs, shahs, tsars and beys of any country‚Äù, form ‚Äúpriests of different religions‚Äù. Poet and publicist Mikayil Rzaguluzade thinks that Javid attempted to solve the issue abstractly, in non- social plan, without revealing imperialistic reality of wars and bloody battles in concrete historical images. It is also noted that there were a lot of Pan-Turkism mistakes of the author, too. Even before the author's arrest, it was stated that Javid's conversion to a peculiar combination of rationalism and subjectivism, social idealism and mysticism were also marked in ‚ÄúIblis‚Äù. According to literary critic Ali Nazim, the main heroes of the drama ‚Äì Arif, Vasif and Iblis ‚Äì were different variations of pivotal image of Javid's creativity. It was also outlined that this is also the image of \\"Turkish bourgeois intelligentsia of war-time and pre-revolutionary period, which is spiritually a dualist\\", which is an embodiment of all socio-psychological and ideological-political reality of Javid's group of intelligents. Nazim writes that in play Javid ‚Äúcomes out in a mask of the Demon on one hand, and in form of Arif, - on the other.‚Äù Hamid Arasli noted that, the influence of the Turkish poet Tevfik Fikret is quite perceptible in a language, visual methods and techniques of this tragedy, and that the ‚ÄúIblis‚Äù play revealed a new stage in the history of Azerbaijan's dramaturgy, besides with ‚ÄúSheikh Sanan‚Äù play. ==Screening== In 2007, a film of a film-director Ramiz Hasanoglu called ‚ÄúJavid‚Äôs life‚Äù and written according to the screen script of Anar ‚Äì People's Writer of Azerbaijan ‚Äì was released. A tragic destiny of Huseyn Javid (plays Rasim Balayev) against the background of his works, such as ‚ÄúSheikh Sanan‚Äù, ‚ÄúSiyavush‚Äù, ‚ÄúLame Teymur‚Äù were shown in the film. Character of Iblis (plays Mammad Safa), a negative hero, became prevailing personage of the film. As it was decided, this character had to be played by one of the actors as a symbol of universal evil, but proceeding from the author's ideas about the multi- faced evil, Iblis appears or in the image of a mystic devil, or an investigator of NKVD, or a lazy priest and or a terrorist-murderer. Sowing death around him, the Iblis himself remains immortal... In the film, evil bursts into Javid's life, attempting to break it, trying to get it under its own control, make it an acquiescent tool of its evil will. There was shown that neither the arrest, nor a forcible separation with dears and the death itself couldn‚Äôt crack Javid down. As the script writer notes, a conditional and symbolic form of the play can be realized in ballet or rock-opera genres, but not in a movie. That is why the idea of eternal evil was used as a basis of the film and the destiny of Javid was thread on it. According to Anar, universality of this idea embodied in the images of such personalities as Stalin, Mussolini and Baghirov. == References == Category:Tragedy plays Category:Azerbaijani plays Category:1918 plays Category:Plays set in Azerbaijan ","title":"The Devil (Javid play)"},{"id":"35831355","text":"Thes is a genus of beetles in the family Latridiidae, containing the following species:Rucker, Wolfgang H.

The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of B9 IV or B9 V. The IV luminosity class would indicate the star is in the subgiant stage, while a V class means it is a main sequence star like the Sun. In the latter case, it is close to entering the subgiant stage at an estimated 93% of the way through its lifespan on the main sequence. Rho2 Arae has more than three times the mass of the Sun and shines with 238 times the Sun's luminosity.

It was first released on May 28, 2012, in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States by Interscope Records. Its lead single, \\"212\\", preceded its release on December 6, 2011. Its second single, \\"Liquorice\\", was released on December 4, 2012. Banks also released music videos for every song, including the non-singles \\"1991\\" and \\"Van Vogue\\". The EP was not eligible for the UK Albums Chart, but the title track charted at number seventy-nine on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached 133 on the US Billboard 200 on the issue dated June 16, 2012, and number twelve on the Rap Albums chart, number seventeen on the R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and number one on the Heatseekers Albums chart. On release, 1991 received positive reviews from music critics. ==Background== Under the name Miss Bank$, she released her first recording \\"Gimme a Chance\\" on the Internet in February 2009. The recording was accompanied by \\"Seventeen\\", a track produced by the American DJ Diplo which sampled the Ladytron song \\"Seventeen\\". Later that year, Banks signed to the XL Records label and began working with the producer Richard Russell. She left the label later that year due to conflicting ideas. After leaving XL Recordings, Banks dropped the Miss Bank$ name and became Azealia Banks, which preceded a move to Montreal. Using YouTube as a portal, Banks uploaded several demo tracks, including \\"L8R\\" and a cover of \\"Slow Hands\\" by Interpol. In September 2011, Banks released her first single \\"212\\" as a free digital download from her website; it was released officially on December 6, 2011, as the lead single from one of Banks' future releases. ==Release and promotion== Originally scheduled for release on April 17, 2012, 1991 was delayed following the musician's change of management on April 13. The EP's artwork and track listing was published online on May 15, with confirmation that 1991 would be released first on May 28 in the United Kingdom. The project was to be released digitally on May 29 and physically on June 12 in the United States, she announced on Twitter. In 2013, 1991 was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), having shipped 35,000 units in Australia. The original track listing had three tracks: the single \\"212\\", \\"1991\\" and \\"Grand Prix\\". Following the delay, it was extended to a four-track EP, with the tracks \\"Liquorice\\" and \\"Van Vogue\\" in place of \\"Grand Prix\\". Banks confirmed on Twitter that she has re-written \\"Grand Prix\\", produced by Lone, and it will feature on her debut studio album Broke With Expensive Taste under the new title of \\"Miss Camaraderie\\". The EP's lead single, \\"212\\", was first released in the United Kingdom on December 6, 2011. The track, which samples and credits \\"Float My Boat\\" by Lazy Jay, had some chart success in Europe, reaching number seven on the Irish Singles Chart and number twelve on the UK Singles Chart. \\"Liquorice\\" was released as the second single on June 14, 2012. == Critical reception == 1991 received mostly positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 84, based on nine reviews. AllMusic editor David Jeffries was amazed by Banks' lyricism and called the EP a \\"short house-rap blast\\". He said Banks \\"acts as if she had been raised at a classic N.Y.C. loft party, one where you kept dancing and dissing\\", and found the production \\"nostalgic ... as if this EP fell through the cracks of the Paradise Garage's sweaty disco floorboards and then evolved in some alternative and fierce universe\\". Chris Dart of Exclaim! was also impressed by her quick rapping and argued that she \\"manages a feat that takes most rappers the better part of a career to master: the perfect marriage of bangin', club-friendly beats and smart, crisply delivered lyrics.\\" In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau called \\"212\\" the highlight of an EP whose music is minimalist yet skillfully crafted: \\"quick-tongued, lascivious, catchy, and delighted with itself ... there hasn't been a more pleasurable record all year and probably won't be‚Äînot even by her.\\" In a less enthusiastic review for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes said the four tracks on 1991 \\"spin hip-hop backwards and forwards\\", although he felt it was too short. Alex Macpherson of Fact felt the EP is somewhat inconsistent, but he compared Banks favorably to Missy Elliott and stated, \\"while the quality of the music remains disproportionate to the hype, it does make her bratty rejection of the rap establishment feel that much more thrilling.\\" Pitchfork journalist Lindsay Zoladz called it \\"another example of Banks' versatile skills\\", but lamented how \\"the half-statement of 1991 reminds us that Banks is still an artist in her development stage.\\" 1991 was ranked by Rolling Stone at number 30 in the magazine's list of 2012's 50 best albums, while Time named it the 9th best album of 2012. In a year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review, Christgau ranked 1991 as the 11th best album of 2012 and the title track as the year's 13th best single. == Track listing Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !

The senatorial districts (except those in New York City) were made up of entire counties. 128 Assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts to a one-year term, the whole Assembly being renewed annually. The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all in the same county. The City and County of New York was divided into four senatorial districts, and 16 Assembly districts. At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Whig Party. ==Elections== The New York state election, 1851 was held on November 4. Of the eight statewide elective offices up for election, six were carried by the Democrats, and two by the Whigs. 16 Democrats and 16 Whigs were elected for a two-year term to the State Senate. 65 Whigs and 63 Democrats were elected to the State Assembly. ==Sessions== The Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in Albany on January 6, 1852; and adjourned on April 16. Jonas C. Heartt (Whig) was elected Speaker with 63 votes against 59 for Israel T. Hatch (Dem.). Ira P. Barnes was elected Clerk of the Senate by resolution, with a vote of 16 to 15; Senator Dan S. Wright (W) did not vote. The same vote was given for Charles Lee as Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate. Doorkeeper of the Senate A. N. Beardsley was elected with the casting vote of Lt. Gov. Sanford E.

Unusually for a star with a Bayer designation, it was not catalogued by Bayer in his Uranometria. It was instead first catalogued by Nicolas Lacaille, in his Coelum Australe Stelliferum published in 1763. This star gained the Bayer designation of Rho1 Arae in Bode's Uranographia, published in 1801. Rho1 Arae is one of the dimmest stars with a Bayer designation, having an apparent visual magnitude of just +6.275 According to the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, this means the star is just barely visible to the naked eye in dark rural skies. Based upon parallax measurements, it is about distant from the Sun, give or take a 50 light-year margin of error. This is a spectroscopic binary system, which means that the presence of an orbiting companion is indicated by shifts in the spectrum. However, because the primary component is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of , it is difficult to obtain reliable orbital elements. The orbital period has been estimated at 0.439 days. The spectrum of this system matches a stellar classification of B3 Vnpe, which may indicate the primary is a B-type main sequence star. The 'e' suffix indicates the presence of emission lines, indicating this is a Be star. For Rho1 Arae, the emission lines are prominent and variable. Rho1 Arae has a peculiar velocity of relative to its neighbors, making it a runaway star system. A scenario that it was ejected from the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association as a result of a past supernova explosion seems unlikely because of its binarity. ==References * HR 6274 * HIP 82868 * Image HD 152478 Category:Ara (constellation) 152478 Category:Emission-line stars 082868 Arae, V846 6274 Arae, Rho1 Category:Durchmusterung objects ","title":"Rho1 Arae"},{"id":"35831513","text":"Duke Wu of Qi (; died 825 BC) was from 850 to 825 BC the eighth recorded ruler of the State of Qi during the Western Zhou Dynasty of ancient China.

Based in Great Bend and Barton County, Kansas, the Rebels were one of the thirteen founding member corps of Drum Corps International.A History of Drum & Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; Drum Corps World, pub.; 2003 ==History== In August 1947, musician John Taff and the Rev. Joseph Tockert of the St. Rose Catholic Church started a drum and bugle corps for the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of the St. Rose Parish to operate under the sponsorship of the Knights of Columbus. The corps had its first public performance on November 26, 1947. When American Legion Argonne Post 180 took over the corps' sponsorship in 1949, membership was opened to all area youth, and the name was changed in recognition of the Legion Post, which had been named after the Argonne Forest, the site of major U.S. military action during World War I. In 1955, Bill and Mary Lou Fryberger became the corps directors for several years. Shortly after the Frybergers left, Glenn Opie became the corps director, a post he would hold through 1973. In 1974, Jenny and Bob Allford were co-directors of Argonne. H.Gene Specht became the director in 1975 and 1976. Jerry and Jan Becker became corps directors in 1977 and would continue until Argonne folded in 1988. Argonne competed with others in the Great Plains area in the 1950s and 1960s. They also competed in numerous VFW and American Legion, championships, and, in 1955, the Rebels won the first of thirteen Kansas State American Legion championships. From the mid-1950s, Argonne was also a major corps on the national scene. They were a finalist in the American Legion Nationals in 1955, '56, '61, '63, '65, '71, and '72; a finalist at VFW Nationals each year from 1968 through 1972; and were Legion National Champions in 1971, '72, and '73. In 1971, two organizations were started with the intent of giving drum corps more control over their activity, which was then largely governed by the veterans organizations. The Midwest Combine was made up of the Blue Stars, Cavaliers, Madison Scouts, Santa Clara Vanguard, and the Troopers; and the United Organization of Junior Corps (also known as the \\"Alliance\\"), was formed by the 27th Lancers, Garfield Cadets, Boston Crusaders, Blessed Sacrament Golden Knights, and Blue Rock. In 1972, the ten corps from the Midwest Combine and the Alliance were joined by the Anaheim Kingsmen, the De La Salle Oaklands, and the Argonne Rebels as founding members of Drum Corps International (DCI), which remains as the sanctioning body for junior corps in North America. At the first DCI World Championships, held in Whitewater, Wisconsin on August 17 and 18, 1972, the Argonne Rebels finished in fifth place. The brass was instructed by Sandra Opie and was considered to be the premier brass section in drum corps; on several occasions, they received a perfect score of 5.0 for Content Analysis. In 1973, the expectations for Argonne were extremely high; not only had the corps finished in fifth place at DCI, but most of the members would be returning for the new season. When the expected new musical arrangements were not received from the arranger, the corps turned to Frank Minear, lead trumpeter for the Stan Kenton band, who had offered to write charts for the corps. Minear's arrangements of \\"Fanfare For The New\\" and \\"M√°laga\\" were transcriptions straight from the Kenton band's arrangements. When combined with Ken Norman's arrangement of \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\", the 1973 Argonne Rebels had what was almost unquestionably the most technically complex musical program that had ever been performed by a drum and bugle corps up to that time. Unfortunately, although things were changing under the new Drum Corps International, technical difficulty was not yet taken into consideration in judging a corps' performance. Additionally, the arrangements made getting the sounds to the fans in the stands in proper synchronization difficult at best, so that the field show was redesigned in mid-season by Drum Corps Hall of Fame senior corps designer Vince Bruni. Although Argonne would finish in eleventh place at DCI World Championships at Whitewater, the season was a disappointment for the members whose early expectations had been so high. Although future DCI Hall of Fame members Truman Crawford, Bernard Baggs, and Don Angelica addressed the corps immediately after the show and attempted to console the members, the corps would never recover from the blow. With the Opies' departure from the corps and Sandra Opie's move from instructor to judge, the corps' brass would never again approach its excellence of the early 1970s. In 1974, Argonne would drop to thirty-third at DCI. The corps would recover somewhat, finishing twentieth in 1975 and eighteenth in 1976, but it would fall to the lower levels of Open Class in 1977, '78, and '79 and would cease operations following the 1979 season. The Argonne Rebels would return as a Class A corps in 1983 but would leave the field for good following the 1984 season. Although the Argonne Rebels have not been in field competition since 1984, its organization still exists to serve the alumni, since more than 3,000 youth from Great Bend and Barton County marched in the corps during its more than forty years of competition. During the Summer of 2015, a special exhibit remembering the Argonne Rebels was presented at the Great Bend Public Library. It was created under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution's ‚ÄúMuseum on Main Street‚Äù program and is sponsored by the Kansas Humanities Council. Additionally, a reunion of Argonne Rebels alumni was held on July 11, and on the 14th, the annual Drum Corps International show \\"Drums Across Kansas\\" moved from Wichita to Great Bend and renamed the \\"March of Champions\\" to honor the two-time American Legion champion corps and its alumni. ==Show summary (1962‚Äì84)== Pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist { style=\\"text- align: center;\\" - !

In 1994, she created, produced and hosted The Aspen Institute Television Show, which \\"featured guests from government, business and media for discussions about leadership.\\" In 2001, Susman hosted The Myth of Superwoman, a conference that focused on the balancing act women face in their personal and career lives. Widespread interest in this issue led her to produce and host Superwoman Central, a public television show that aired on Houston PBS in 2005. In 2007, Susman created and produced Balancing Your Life, a program broadcast nationally on PBS that addressed the challenges of managing career and family. Filmed on location throughout the country, the program featured interviews with prominent and professionally diverse guests, including Chris Evert, Frances Beinecke, Nell Merlino, Janet Gurwitch, Cindy Pawlcyn, Consuelo Mack, Eileen Collins, Sue Naegle, Kuki Gallman, Kavita Ramdas, Maria Blanco and Dana Buchman. Her interview with Rosanne Cash was nominated for a 2007 Lone Star EMMY Award for Outstanding Achievement Interview/Discussion. Susman edited Danger Pay: Memoir of a Photojournalist in the Middle East, written by her late sister, Carol Spencer Mitchell (1954-2004). The memoir was published in November 2008 by University of Texas Press, and was selected by the 2009 University Press Books Committee as an outstanding-rated title essential to most public and secondary school libraries.

During her tenure as director at Art In Embassies, Susman focused on developing innovative new partnerships in both the public and private sectors expanding the profile, collection, and outreach efforts; bringing artists to South Africa, Rome, Berlin, London, Bern, Doha and The Hague, among others; forming partnerships with the Institute of American Indian Arts to create a portfolio of work for new American Embassies; and furthering Ambassadors‚Äô outreach in their respective host country communities. She also expanded the program by partnering with Ambassador Patrick Gaspard to bring U.S. artists to South Africa, fulfilling the program's mission to create international dialogue and transform lives through art. This relationship led to an opportunity for Ambassador Gaspard to participate with other ambassadors and artists in a program at the Aspen Institute titled Cultural Diplomacy: Why Art Matters, which Susman facilitated. From 2011-2012, Susman served on the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts for the John F.

The game is popular in game theory because the conclusions can be applied to real- life networks. == The game == * n players * each player i has utility U_i(x) for amount x of bandwidth * user i pays w_i for amount x of bandwidth and receives net utility of U_i(x)-w_i * the total amount of bandwidth available is B We also use assumptions regarding U_i(x) * U_i(x)\\\\ge0 * U_i(x) is increasing and concave * U(x) is continuous The game arises from trying to find a price p so that every player individually optimizes their own welfare. This implies every player must individually find \\\\underset x{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}}\\\\,U_i(x)-px. Solving for the maximum yields U_i^'(x)=p. == Problem == With this maximum condition, the game then becomes a matter of finding a price that satisfies an equilibrium. Such a price is called a market clearing price. == Possible solution == A popular idea to find the price is a method called fair sharing. In this game, every player i is asked for amount they are willing to pay for the given resource denoted by w_i. The resource is then distributed in x_i amounts by the formula x_i=\\\\left(\\\\frac{w_i}{\\\\sum_jw_j}\\\\right)*(B). This method yields an effective price p=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_jw_j}{B}. This price can proven to be market clearing thus the distribution x_1,...,x_n is optimal. The proof is as so: == Proof == \\\\underset{x_i}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}}\\\\,U_i(x_i)-w_i \\\\implies \\\\underset{w_i}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}}\\\\,U_i\\\\left(\\\\frac{w_i}{\\\\sum_jw_j}*B\\\\right)-w_i \\\\implies U^'_i\\\\left(\\\\frac{w_i}{\\\\sum_jw_j}*B\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum_jw_j}*B-\\\\frac{w_i}{(\\\\sum_jw_j)^2}*B\\\\right)-1=0 \\\\implies U^'_i(x_i)\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{p}-\\\\frac{1}{p}*\\\\frac{x_i}{B}\\\\right)-1=0 \\\\implies U^'_i(x_i)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{x_i}{B}\\\\right)=p Comparing this result to the equilibrium condition above, we see that when \\\\frac{x_i}{B} is very small, the two conditions equal each other and thus, the fair sharing game is almost optimal. ==References== Category:Game theory ","title":"Bandwidth-sharing game"},{"id":"35831727","text":"Bull's Wood is a 12 hectare nature reserve east of Cockfield in Suffolk, England.

The default web browser is Epiphany, the default browser for the GNOME desktop environment, although other browsers are available or can be built using the native Upkg package manager. Typical applications found on the paldo Live/Install CD and in the repository have included: * Epiphany * Tomboy * OpenOffice.org * Totem * Pidgin * Gedit Subsequent to the 1.22 stable release, paldo adopted a rolling release format and by April 2011 paldo stable included GNOME 3.0, the Linux 2.6.38.3 kernel, and had already moved to systemd, a few weeks earlier than Fedora. ==Package management system== paldo uses the Upkg package manager to update/upgrade the system and to install applications. Upkg was uniquely developed for the paldo project and is responsible for the distribution's character as a mixed source and binary based operating system. Written in C#, Upkg uses the Mono runtime to build packages from source, or to install pre-built binaries, using XML specifications that can be customized by the user. It relies on the command- line interface rather than a graphics-based user interface implementation commonly found in many desktop-oriented Linux distributions. Upkg provides dependency resolution, package indexing and automatic menu additions, although its processing time to upgrade the system and install packages, even those available through the online paldo repository, has been found to be relatively long.Linton, Susan. \\"Feature: Paldo\\", \\"linux.com\\", 11 December 2007.

It was started as a quarterly publication, but from the April/May 1976 issue its frequency became bimonthly. The magazine was based in Boston. ==Background== After the publication of Prairie Fire: the Politics of Revolutionary Anti-imperialism, the Weather Underground Organization (WUO) continued to establish a media presence by publishing a quarterly magazine entitled Osawatomie. Osawatomie debuted in March 1975 and gave the WUO an outlet to solidify the organization, its purpose, and its politics. It was also the WUO's attempt to establish the organization in a position of leadership of the New Left. The magazine was named Osawatomie in honor of John Brown, a white abolitionist who, in 1856 in Osawatomie, Kansas, led a small group of anti-slavery forces in an armed fight to prevent the state of Kansas from becoming a slave state and with whom the WUO is symbolically linked through the tradition of militant white anti-racism. == Description and History == Each issue of Osawatomie included editorials, book reviews, a \\"Toolbox\\" section in which certain communist ideas were explained in everyday language, and news about other anti-imperialist struggles around the world. Each issue also included a \\"Who We Are\\" section which gave a brief history of the WUO in which the Organization claimed responsibility for \\"over 25 armed actions against the enemy,\\" in this case, the U.S. Government. The \\"Who We Are\\" section also outlined the five key points of the WUO program which included eliminating U.S. imperialism from the Third World; peace, by opposing \\"imperialist war and U.S. intervention;\\" fighting racism by building an anti- racist base among the working class and supporting self-determination for oppressed peoples; struggling for freedom of women against sexism; and fighting for socialism by organizing the working class. After the completion of Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-imperialism, the Organization established a larger print shop in Boston which included a darkroom and plate-making facilities. Like Prairie Fire, Osawatomie was printed clandestinely. Unlike the apartment print shop where Prairie Fire was printed, the Boston print shop was out in the open. To prevent the neighbors from discovering the true nature of the print shop, they were told that the business was a small travel agency that had their own press [this needs confirmation]. Each issue of the magazine was between 28 and 32 pages, cost between 25 and 50 cents (including postage), and was distributed to news organizations, activists, and subscribers. Once the initial distribution was completed, the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee would reprint the magazine for a wider circulation. ==Purpose== As a publication of the WUO, Osawatomie gave little attention to any of the bombings that were attributed to the Organization. While they were reported on, they were not given front-page status. Instead, the magazine focused on controversial issues central to the Left. Another focus of the magazine was that of organizing a mass movement as opposed to bombings of government buildings carried out by a select few. For members of the WUO, Osawatomie was a magazine of conflicting viewpoints. For Bernardine Dohrn, the magazine was a way to reenergize the movement at large. For others, it was a significant shift in politics, moving the Organization away from Third World movements and focusing on communist populism. For some, the magazine brought up the question of why the organization was still underground. The production of the magazine was a way to do more than the bombings; however, some didn't see the need for it to be done underground. Publishing the magazine was far from the militant struggle against oppression that originally pushed the Organization underground. Others saw the magazine as speaking for certain members of the group instead of the group as a whole. By its sixth and final issue, Osawatomie mirrored the internal struggles of the WUO in its pages. The program points of the WUO as outlined in the \\"Who We Are\\" section shifted from struggle against anti-imperialism to that of class struggle and shifted from organizing other whites against anti-racism to organizing a multiracial working class. With the dissolution of the WUO, Osawatomie ceased publication. == Magazine Content and Format == Osawatomie followed the same basic format for each issue and included several recurring sections. ===Who We Are=== Each issue of Osawatomie included a section titled \\"Who We Are\\" in which the Weather Underground Organization establishes its identity and describes what they are working towards. The section took up approximately one half of a page and included information from which the name Weather Underground Organization was derived; a line from the song \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" by Bob Dylan which said, \\"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.\\" They also used this space to outline the program points for the Weather Underground Organization. They were listed as *US imperialism out of the Third World. *Peace. Oppose imperialist war and US Intervention *Fight racism. Build and anti-racist base within the working class. Support self-determination for oppressed peoples. *Struggle against sexism and for the freedom of women. *Organize the working class. Fight for socialism. Power to the people. This section in each issue concluded with this final sentence: \\"In a single sentence, the program means this: Mobilize the exploited and oppressed people to wage the class struggle against US Imperialism, the common enemy.\\" Beginning with Vol. 1 No. 4, the first program point included a second sentence, \\"Independence for Puerto Rico.\\" In Vol. 1 Nos. 2-4, the section was found on the second page of the magazine (the inside front cover). In Vol. 2, the section was relocated to Page 27, the inside back cover. === Where We Stand === In each issue, the magazine included a section called \\"Where We Stand\\" which detailed the politics of the Central Committee, the governing committee of the Weather Underground Organization. Some of the subjects covered in this section were anti-imperialism and the need to organize against it (Vol. 1. No. 2, Vol 2. No. 1 and Vol. 2 No. 2), Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and how it led to the publishing of Prairie Fire (Vol. 1, No. 3), and the women's movement (Vol. 1 No.3). Each essay in this section was attributed to the Central Committee except for Vol. 1 No.3 in which a copy of a speech given by Bernardine Dohrn was reprinted and Vol 1. No. 3 which was also signed \\"Celia Sojourn for the Central Committee, WUO. Celia Sojourn is a pseudonym, but it is not known for whom (needs Berger reference). ===Toolbox=== Most issues included a \\"Toolbox\\" section in which terms central to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism were explained in everyday language. Some of the terms discussed were class struggle (Vol 1. No.2), socialism (Vol 1. No. 3), surplus value (Vol. 1, No. 4) and self-determination (Vol. 2 No. 1). ==References * Osawatomie, Summer 1975, No. 2 Category:Bimonthly magazines published in the United States Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct political magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1975 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1976 Category:Magazines published in Boston Category:Weather Underground ","title":"Osawatomie (periodical)"},{"id":"35831779","text":"Omar Zoboli (born 1953, Modena) is an Italian oboist and professor at the Musikhochschule Basel \\\\- Switzerland ==Studies and competitions== He studied Oboe under Sergio Possidoni, Heinz Holliger and Paul Dombrecht.

He was educated at Eton College before studying at New College, Oxford, switching to history after a year of mathematics and obtaining a first-class degree in 1907. He joined the Indian Civil Service, winning the Boden Sanskrit Scholarship during his probation, and worked in India from 1909 onwards in various capacities. He took the opportunity to retire in 1924 after working in India for 15 years, and returned to England. Thereafter he spent his time on the study of Sanskrit, later learning sufficient Tibetan and Chinese to make use of material available in those languages. Although Johnston seems only to have published one article in India (on a group of medieval statues), his later works show that he had noted local Indian practices in agriculture and other areas, since he made reference to these in his analysis of Sanskrit texts. Between 1928 and 1936, he published an edition and translation of the Buddhacarita (\\"Acts of the Buddha\\") by the 2nd-century author A≈õvagho·π£a; this was described by the writer of his obituary in The Times as his \\"magnum opus\\". In 1937, he was elected Boden Professor of Sanskrit and Keeper of the Indian Institute at the University of Oxford, also becoming a Professorial Fellow of Balliol College. He started cataloguing the Sanskrit manuscripts acquired for the Bodleian Library by an earlier Boden professor, A. A. Macdonell, helped improve the museum of the Indian Institute, and worked on the manuscripts held by the India Office Library. He published several articles on a variety of topics. Johnston married Iris May, daughter of Sir Henry May. Johnston's brother predeceased him and he then took his brother's children into his household. His family moved to safety in the United States during the Second World War while he stayed in Oxford, serving as an Air Raid Warden and in the Home Guard. He died on 24 October 1942 at the age of 57. ==Reputation== His obituary in The Times described his death as \\"a heavy loss not only to his friends and to Oxford but to Sanskrit studies everywhere.\\" Writing in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, his predecessor as Boden Professor, F. W. Thomas, said that \\"friends and orientalists\\" will have \\"widely deplored\\" his death, since he was \\"favourably situated for a long continuation of the highly congenial work to which he had brought a vigorous competence.\\" Thomas added that Johnston was \\"accessible and helpful\\" to his war-time students. == References == Category:1885 births Category:1942 deaths Category:British orientalists Category:Boden Professors of Sanskrit Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford Category:Fellows of Balliol College, Oxford Category:Indian Civil Service (British India) officers ","title":"Edward Johnston (orientalist)"},{"id":"35831817","text":"Duke Cheng of Qi (; died 795 BC) was from 803 to 795 BC the eleventh recorded ruler of the State of Qi during the Western Zhou Dynasty of ancient China.

Covaci became a Catholic priest and then a protopope in Diosig and after in Oradea, where he was proposed by the priests to the episcopate. On September 16, 1748, Pope Benedict XIV named him auxiliary bishop of the Latin Rite Oradea Diocese, in charge of its Romanian Greek-Catholic parishes and was consecrated titular bishop of Tegea in the Byzantine Rite by Manuil Olshavskyi, Vicar Apostolic of Mukacheve. This arrangement did not satisfy the diocese's Romanians, who wanted an independent diocese, a separate cathedral, Romanian schools, their own seminary and monastery, and better pay for their priests and archpriests. Covaci pressed these demands, and in 1756 he asked Empress Maria Theresa, through the Lieutenant Council, to establish \\"popular schools\\" in Oradea, Beiu≈ü and Va≈ücƒÉu. The Empress responded positively to this request as it can be seen in the Sematics of the Latin Diocese of Oradea in 1765, p. 164\\\\.

The marsh has two regions, the Great Sippewisset Marsh to the north and Little Sippewisset Marsh to the south, separated from each other by a narrow tongue of land (Saconesset Hills). The marsh extends into an estuary in which the intertidal zone provides a dynamic environment that supports a diverse ecology, including threatened and endangered species such as the roseate tern (Sterna dougallii). The ecology of the salt marsh is based in and supported by the microbial mats which cover the ground of the marsh. ==Description== The Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh The Sippewissett Salt Marsh houses a diverse, laminated intertidal microbial mat around 1 cm thick. The mat is characterized by regular influx of sea water, high amounts of sulfide and iron, and the production of methane. The mat contains four or five distinctly colored layers. The color of each layer can be attributed to the microbial community composition and the biogeochemical processes they perform at each of the layers. The mats are often coated by green macro- and microalgae that adhere to the surface. The top, green-brown layer is composed of cyanobacteria and diatom species. A blue-green intermediate layer is formed by Oscillatoria species. Purple sulfur bacteria are found in the pink central layer. Below the pink layer, an orange-black layer is formed predominately by a single species of purple sulfur bacteria, Thiocapsa pfennigii, and spirochetes. The thin, bottom layer is made up of green sulfur bacteria belonging to the genus Prosthecochloris, though this layer is not always present. Below the mat is iron sulfide-rich sediments and remnants of decaying mats. ==StructureGreen layer=== The top 1 mm of the green layer is often gold due to the dominant cyanobacteria and diatom species. Specific cyanobacteria identified are Lyngbya, a sheeted cyanobacterium, and Nostoc and Phormidium, which are filamentous cyanobacteria, and Spirulina spp. Diatom species identified include Navicula. Below this top gold layer extends 5 mm and is dominated by Lyngbya and Oscillatoria species The green layer is also composed of green sulfur bacteria which oxidize sulfur during their growth and are strict photolithotrophs. ===Pink layer=== The pink layer extends 3 mm below the green layer. The color is due to the presence of carotinoids which are the primary pigments of the phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria. Amoebobacter, Thiocapsa, Chromatium, and Thiocystis are among the species of purple sulfur bacteria identified. Purple sulfur bacteria can use a number of different electron donors for their anaerobic phototrophic growth, including: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen. Their diverse use of many electron donors makes this layer stand out in the microbial mat community. ===Black layer=== The bottom layer makes up the lower 2 mm of the mat before the depth drops below the chemocline. The black color is due to the high amounts of iron sulfide generated by the green sulfur-reducing bacteria. The layer consists mostly of green sulfur bacteria belonging to the Prosthecochloris, which are a small group of prosthecate bacteria containing many knobby projections. Organisms in this layer decompose organic matter formed by the upper layers, thus recycling the matter. ===Gray layer=== The thin, bottommost layer lies below the chemocline and contains fewer organisms than the slightly thicker black layer. The gray color is due to the presence of pyrite. Here, the empty shells of diatoms can be found. Microbial species here are dominated by methylotrophic methanogens which generate the methane observed in the salt marsh. This layer is not active year-round; the organisms are largely dormant in the winter. ==Metabolism== The metabolism of the organisms throughout each layer of the microbial mats are tightly coupled to each other and play important roles in providing nutrients for the plants and animals that live in the marsh. The cyanobacteria and diatom algae present in the mat are aerobic photoautotrophs whose energy is derived from the light with oxygen as the electron acceptor and use hydrogen gas and iron as electron donors. Purple sulfur bacteria are anaerobic or microaerophilic photoautotrophs, and use hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen as electron donors.

It is a story that primarily follows two characters, Bennett and Lloyd, and the unlikely love that blossoms between them. It is one of three romantic novels by this author who typically wrote about more serious topics. ==Plot summary== The story opens with Ward Bennett, an explorer of extraordinary will, and his men making an attempt to reach the North Pole, enduring brutal hardships. Many of the men die slow, painful deaths, and they all would have had a boat not stumbled across them. However, when they arrive back home, Bennett and his surviving men are greeted with a heroes welcome. At this point the attention of the novel shifts to Lloyd Searight, a young, attractive girl, who works as a nurse, despite being independently wealthy. The reader discovers that Lloyd and Bennett have mutual feelings for each other, although neither one has ever expressed these feelings. Ferriss, Bennett's closest friend. contracts typhoid fever, and Lloyd is in charge of nursing him. Fearing that she will contract the disease, Bennett refuses to let Lloyd come near Ferriss, and as a result, Ferriss dies. Lloyd refuses to speak to Bennett, and they both enter into a time of deep despair. However, when Bennett comes down with the same disease, Lloyd is forced to nurse him, and they eventually reconcile, and marry. At this point, Lloyd gives up nursing, Bennett gives up exploring, and they go live in the country together while Bennett works on a book, both for a while very happy with their situation. However, after talking with Bennet's man Alder, who does work around the house, Lloyd realizes that it is Bennett's calling, his duty to America, to lead the first expedition to the north pole.\\"Frank Norris,\\" Joseph R. McElrath Jr. and Jesse S. Crisler, The New York Times, January 1, 2006. The book ends with him setting off, while Lloyd rather proudly watches him go. ==Characters== #Bennett ‚Äî An arctic explorer, the main character of the book. He is described as having almost a super-human drive and super-human strength. Bennett is a brute of a man, the perfect type to lead an arctic exploration, which he does, once at the beginning of the book, and again at its end. In the middle he becomes the husband of Lloyd. #Lloyd ‚Äî Second-most prominent figure in the novel. Lloyd is a nurse, who, unbeknownst to her colleagues, is independently wealthy. She is also extremely strong-willed, and is an excellent nurse. She never meets anyone who can match her will until she meets Bennett. Ends up as his wife. #Ferriss ‚Äî Bennett's second in command on his first attempt to reach the north pole, as well as his closest friend. Bennett has a great respect for Ferriss, even though in the end he indirectly causes his death. #Alder ‚Äî One of Bennett's men, a weak individual who follows orders well. He worships Bennett, and is heartbroken at the idea that he may not make another trip to the north pole because of his marriage to Lloyd. Does housework for Bennett when they are not traveling. #Dr. Pitts ‚Äî The town doctor. Lloyd often assists him with his patients. #Hattie Campbell ‚Äî Little girl who receives a hip operation. Lloyd helps with this, and it shows the reader her abilities and talents as a nurse. #Duane ‚Äî Englishman who makes an attempt at the North Pole, after Bennett‚Äôs first trip. His attempt is a failure. #Tremlidge, Garlock, and Campbell ‚Äî The three men who plead with Bennett to make a return trip up north. They want the trip to be made by and American and offer to finance a voyage by Bennett. #Hansen, Clark, Dennison, and Muck Tu ‚Äî All members of Bennett‚Äôs crew who do not die in the north. They play minor roles in role in the novel. ==Themes== The main theme throughout this book, according to Warren French, in his book entitled Frank Norris, is the relationships between the sexes, and the superiority of men over women. One example of this happens when Bennett prevents Lloyd from taking care of Ferriss. Lloyd is a modern working woman, wealthy and described as very strong willed. And yet, in the end, her will breaks down, she gives into Bennett, and as a result Ferriss dies.French, Warren G. (1962). Frank Norris. New York: Twayne. Norris is not just commenting on men‚Äôs superiority over women, but to a degree over nature and disease. Bennett, the illustration of manhood in this novel, is able to conquer everything in the world, with the one exception - himself. ==Critical reception== Don Graham, in Critical Essays on Frank Norris, quotes an unnamed critic, who points out that there is ‚Äúnot a passage in the book that is pleasant to read‚Äù.Graham, Don (1980). Critical Essays on Frank Norris. Boston, MA: G.K. Hall, p. 21. As well as Bennett‚Äôs brutal struggles in the frozen north, and Lloyd‚Äôs job as a nurse taking care of dying people, this same critic describes some of the passages in this book as ‚Äúwearisome‚Äù and ‚Äúrambling‚Äù. In addition, he or she takes offense at the title of the novel, and says that Bennett is not the image of modern manliness, but that he is little better than an ape, between his appearance and his demeanor. Literary critic Warren French, was, in general, very critical of the book, saying that it has ‚Äúall the usual Norris touches- formless fears of self indulgence, a puritanical repression of feelings, and contempt for ‚Äòinferior races‚Äô (French, 86)‚Äù. A reviewer from The Critic said of Lloyd that she was ‚Äúas far from any ideal of a man‚Äôs woman heretofore presented as the east is from the west (Marchand, 209).‚Äù She was not a terribly well received heroine, and this book as a whole was not well received by its critics. Many believe Norris already had his mind on his next book while he was still writing this one, and that it shows. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Civello, Paul (1996). \\"Evolutionary Feminism, Popular Romance, and Frank Norris's 'Man's Woman',\\" Studies in American Fiction, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 23‚Äì44. * Fried, Michael (1990). \\"Almayer's Face: On 'Impressionism' in Conrad, Crane, and Norris,\\" Critical Inquiry, Vol. 17, No. 1, pp. 193‚Äì236. * Hussman, Lawrence E.

He was born on 17 October 1847 in the village of Bluntisham in the former English county of Huntingdonshire. He was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1868, he passed the competitive examination for entry into the Indian Civil Service, spent two years in training and was then posted to the Bombay Presidency. == India == Baines arrived in India in 1870, approximately halfway through the five-year-long attempt to collect statistical population data, which was the first such exercise by the Raj administration. In 1881, he was deputy superintendent of the census in the Presidency and excelled to the degree that he was appointed Census Commissioner for the national census of 1891. He had worked as an assistant collector and magistrate at Poona from 1883 and held various other posts while in India. Baines spent much of his time organising the censuses and also analysing and producing reports based on their data, which were \\"widely recognised as the work of a brilliant ethnographer and statistician\\", according to an obituary published in Nature. For the 1891 census, Baines changed the classification from that which had been used in the exercise of 1881. His obituary in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society describes the changes as being \\"first the separation of caste from religion and, secondly, the substitution of the population subsisting by an occupation for that exercising it.\\" He wrote the resultant 300-page General Report. His work influenced that of his successors, such as H. H. Risley and Edward Gait, and his obituary in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society noted that == Later life and recognition == In January 1894, Baines was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India. He had worked on the decennial Report on Moral and Material Progress for 1891 and he was appointed as Secretary to the Royal Opium Commission for the period 1894‚Äì1895. He retired near to the end of 1895. Returning to England, he initially settled in London and became involved in local politics and administration, becoming an Alderman of London County Council between 1898 and 1902. He moved to Kidlington, Oxford in 1904, was knighted in 1905. and was a member of the Oxfordshire County Council from 1917 until 1922. Much of his involvement in Oxfordshire politics concerned education. Baines was elected a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1881 and served a term as its president between 1909 and 1910, following a continuous period as a member of the Society's Council from 1895. The society awarded him its Guy Medal in Gold in 1900, making him one of the eight people to receive the honour between its inception in 1892 and 1930. Baines was also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society from 1896, an Honorary Member of the American Statistical Association and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute from 1897. He died at Kidlington on 26 November 1925. He had married Constance Pyne in 1874, and the couple had a son and a daughter.. Baines was well liked in the princely state of Travancore for his services to the Maharajah.

BJP, the main Indian opposition party expressed its dismay at a judge writing to the Prime Minister for securing the release of a Pakistani prisoner in his individual capacity. In April 2012, Pakistan President Zardari appealed to Indian Prime Minister Singh to release him on humanitarian grounds and allow him to return to Pakistan. ===Reference to the Sarabjit Singh case=== In November 2012 ex-justice Katju wrote to the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan requesting clemency for Sarabjit Singh on similar grounds. Sarabjit Singh is an Indian citizen who has also spent the last 22 years in Pakistani jail under conviction of terrorism. His family and supporters have maintained Sarabjit's innocence and claim that the arrest was on the grounds of mistaken identity. ==Release on bail== At the intervention of the Indian Prime Minister Dr Singh, the Indian supreme court granted Chisty bail on humanitarian grounds in April 2012. He was subsequently also allowed to visit Pakistan until 1 November 2012 on a security deposit of 500,000 Indian Rupees. ==Release== On his return from bail in Pakistan, Dr. Chishty was freed by the Indian Supreme Court in December 2012 and allowed to return to Pakistan. == References == Category:Pakistani scientists Category:Living people Category:Pakistani prisoners and detainees Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Khaleel Chishty"},{"id":"35831943","text":"Darsham Marshes is a 20 hectare nature reserve south of Darsham in Suffolk, England.

He spent some time in the household of John Hotham, Bishop of Ely, whose early career had been spent in Ireland. He accompanied Hotham to the Papal Court at Avignon in 1316, the mission being concerned largely with Irish Church affairs. He later became a royal servant: he visited Ireland on the King's business in 1326.

Chalkida, is an association football club based in Chalkida, Greece. The club was founded in 1967 upon the merger of Olympiakos Chalkida and Evrypos Chalkida. Its colours are black and blue and its symbol is the nymph Arethusa. Their greatest honour was winning the Beta Ethniki in 1968 and playing in the 1968‚Äì69 Alpha Ethniki. They currently play in the Group 3 of Gamma Ethniki. == History  Before the merger === A.C. Chalkis was founded in 1967 after a merger between the biggest clubs in the city, Olympiakos Chalkida and Evrypos, who were both competing in the Greek Second Division at the time, with Olympiakos finishing 4th and Evrypos 9th. Due to a law by the regime of the Colonels which ruled Greece since April 1967, athletic clubs that were based in the same city were forced to merge with each other. As a result, Olympiakos Chalkida and Evrypos were merged in summer 1967 and the resulting club was named A.C. Chalkis in order to represent the city of Chalkis as a whole. === A.C. Chalkis === In the following 1967‚Äì68 season and first one after the merger, Chalkida finished 1st in Beta Ethniki's Northern Group and was promoted to the Alpha Ethniki for the first time. However, they were immediately relegated after one season, as they finished 17th in the 1968‚Äì69 Alpha Ethniki, second last only to AEL Limassol. Until 1989 the team competed in the Beta and Gamma Ethniki championships, without repeating the success of their first season, although they won 2 Gamma Ethniki championships in 1977 and 1987. From 1989 to 1996 the team was competing in the lower Gamma and Delta Ethniki championships, and from 1996 to 2003 only in the Delta Ethniki. === Decline === In 2003 A.C. Chalkis returned to the national championships after seven years, participating in the 2003‚Äì04 season of Gamma Ethniki and finishing 11th. Although having finished in a safe mid-table position, the team was in a financial turmoil; the entire squad was released and negotiations with potential investors were unsuccessful. After a planned merger with local club Doxa Prokopiou was not implemented, Chalkida decided to pull out of every championship, remain inactive for a year and re- appear at the local Evia Football Club Association leagues for the 2005‚Äì06 season. A.C. Chalkis finished 1st in the A1 Division of Evia and was promoted to the Delta Ethniki in 2010. The club also won the Evia Amateur Cup six times and finished as runners-up once, with their last victory being in 2012. == Achievements == *Beta Ethniki **Winners (1): 1967‚Äì68 *Gamma Ethniki **Winners (1): 1986‚Äì87 *Delta Ethniki **Winners (3): 1991‚Äì92, 1993‚Äì94, 2002‚Äì03 *Evia FCA Championship **Winners (3): 1976-77, 2009‚Äì10, 2014‚Äì15 *Evia FCB Championship **Winners (1): 2007-08 *Evia FCA Cup **Winners (7): 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2011, 2012, 2018 **Runners-up (1): 2000 ==League and cup history== { bgcolor=\\"#f7f8ff\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:center\\" -bgcolor=\\"#868686\\" style=\\"color: #ffffff\\"  width=\\"60\\" align=\\"center\\" Season  width=\\"40\\" align=\\"center\\"Tier 1  width=\\"40\\" align=\\"center\\"Tier 2  width=\\"40\\" align=\\"center\\"Tier 3  width=\\"40\\" align=\\"center\\"Tier 4  width=\\"40\\" align=\\"center\\"Tier 5  width=\\"40\\" align=\\"center\\"Tier 6  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"Pts.  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"Pl.  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"W  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"L  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"T  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"GS  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"GA  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"Diff.  width=\\"105\\" align=\\"center\\"Greek Cup - 1967-19681 (G1)Round of 16 - 1968-1969bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\"17did not participate - 1969-19703 (G2)did not participate - 1970-19719 (G2)Round of 16 - 1971-19728 (G2)did not participate - 1972-19733 (G2)Round of 64 - 1973-19744 (G2)Round of 16 - 1974-19752 (G1)First Round - 1975-1976bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\"19 (S)Round of 16 - 1976-1977bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"1 (G5)did not participate - 1977-19787 (S)Round of 64 - 1978-1979bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\"14 (S)Round of 32 - 1979-1980bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"2 (S)did not participate - 1980-19815 (S)Round of 64 - 1981-19825 (S)Round of 32 - 1982-19834 (S)Round of 64 - 1983-1984bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\"20 (S)Round of 64 - 1984-19852 (S)Round of 64 - 1985-19865 (S)Round of 16 - 1986-1987bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"1 (S)Round of 64 - 1987-1988bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\"18Round of 64 - 1988-1989bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\" ' 3 (Group 14) - 1989-1990did not participate - 1990-1991did not participate - 1991-1992bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"1 (G4)did not participate - 1992-1993bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\" ' 4 (Group 2) - 1993-1994bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\" ' did not participate - 1994-19952 (Group 4) - 1995-1996bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\" ' 4 (Group 4) - 1996-1997did not participate - 1997-1998did not participate - 1998-1999did not participate - 1999-2000did not participate - 2000-2001did not participate - 2001-20026 (G2)did not participate - 2002-2003bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"1 (G6)did not participate - 2003-2004bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"11Round of 64 - 2005-2006bgcolor=\\"#FF8080\\"16did not participate - 2006-2007did not participate - 2007-2008bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"1did not participate - 2008-20095did not participate - 2009-2010bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"1did not participate - 2010-20115 (G7)did not participate - 2011-20122 (G7)did not participate - 2012-2013bgcolor=\\"#80FF9F\\"5 (G7)did not participate - 2013-201411 (G3)did not participate } ===Cup results history=== Greek Cup *1967-68: **A.C.

Licensed under the permissive 2-clause BSD license, OSRM is a free network service. OSRM supports Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OS X platform. ==Overview== It combines sophisticated routing algorithms with the open and free road network data of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. Shortest path computation on a continental sized network can take up to several seconds if it is done without a so-called speedup-technique. OSRM uses an implementation of contraction hierarchies and is able to compute and output a shortest path between any origin and destination within a few milliseconds, whereby the pure route computation takes much less time. Most effort is spent in annotating the route and transmitting the geometry over the network. Since it is designed with OpenStreetMap compatibility in mind, OSM data files can be easily imported. A demo installation is sponsored by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and previously by Geofabrik. The screen shot image shown is since September 2015 out of date with loss of attendant routing service features.

This article shows statistics of the club's players in the season, and also lists all matches that the club played during the season. Their sixth-place finish and subsequent play-off semi-final defeat during the 2011‚Äì12 campaign means it was Stevenage's second season of playing in League One, having only spent two years as a Football League club. The season also marked the third season that the club played under its new name ‚Äì Stevenage Football Club, dropping 'Borough' from its title as of 1 June 2010. It was manager Gary Smith's first start to a season as Stevenage manager, having been appointed in January 2012. However, Smith was sacked in March 2013 following a run of 14 defeats in 18 games. His successor was Graham Westley, returning for his third spell in-charge of Stevenage, having previously managed the club for three years from 2003 to 2006, and then four years during his second-spell from 2008 to 2012. Ahead of the season, there were wholesale changes involving the playing squad. Eight players were released in May 2012, including Ronnie Henry, subsequently ending his seven- year association with the club. With a number of players out of contract, further departures were revealed as Chris Beardsley, Joel Byrom, Scott Laird and John Mousinho all rejected the offer of contract extensions at Stevenage, and all four ended up signing for Preston North End, who at the time were managed by Westley. Three more first-team players left Stevenage before the start of the new campaign, both Michael Bostwick and Lawrie Wilson made the step up to the Championship, signing for Peterborough United and Charlton Athletic for respective undisclosed fees; while Craig Reid signed for League Two side Aldershot Town for a five-figure fee. Smith's first three signings of the close season were announced at the end of May, with goalkeeper Steve Arnold joining from Wycombe Wanderers, as well as midfielders James Dunne and Greg Tansey signing from Exeter City and Inverness Caledonian Thistle respectively. Five more players joined the club before the start of pre- season, and Lee Hills and Matt Ball were further additions following successful trials. In terms of transfer activity during the season, both Don Cowan and Rob Sinclair left the club on free transfers. Strikers Patrick Agyemang and Dani L√≥pez were signed before the close of the summer transfer window, while defenders Andy Iro and Ben Chorley were acquired mid-season. Despite the squad overhaul, Stevenage began the season positively, going on an eleven-match unbeaten run, six of which victories, to open the new campaign. Following the club's 2‚Äì1 home victory over Portsmouth in late October 2012, Stevenage found themselves in second place, just a point behind the league leaders at the time. However, Stevenage were defeated heavily in three of their next four matches, conceding four goals in each of the three defeats. Sitting in fifth position at the start of December, Stevenage would go on to win just five league matches out of the remaining 25, although did secure notable victories over promotion-chasing Brentford and Sheffield United. A run of 14 defeats in 18 matches ultimately resulted in Smith's sacking on 20 March 2013, \\". Captain Mark Roberts briefly took caretaker charge, before it was announced that Westley would be returning for a third spell in-charge of the club, joining on 30 March. The club ended the season in 18th position in League One, with 54 points. Stevenage also competed in three cup competitions during the season. The club opened the season by beating AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup, and as a result won a League Cup fixture for the first time in their history. They lost to Premier League side Southampton at Broadhall Way in the Second Round. The club fell at the first hurdle in both the Football League Trophy and FA Cup, losing 3‚Äì2 away to League Two opposition in both competitions; firstly to Dagenham & Redbridge in the Football League Trophy, before losing to Rotherham United in the FA Cup. Winger Lucas Akins, who had joined the club in August 2012 for an undisclosed fee, was the club's top goalscorer for the season with ten goals, all of which came in the league. Akins also played in all 46 of Stevenage's league matches during the campaign, the only Stevenage player to remain ever-present during the league season. Another pre-season signing, James Dunne, won the Player of the Year award, as well as being voted Players' Player of the Year, for the season. ==Squad details== :Last updated on 27 April 2013.

A home fixture against Championship side Peterborough United was later added to the list of friendlies. In early July, the club announced that Stevenage would be travelling to Dublin to play two further pre-season friendlies, against St James's Gate and UCD respectively. It was also revealed that due to the first- team's pre-season tour to Dublin, the club would instead be sending a Stevenage XI side, composed of trialists and youth players, to the arranged fixture against Hitchin Town on 24 July. Similarly, Stevenage sent a Stevenage XI side to play Colney Heath on 31 July, as opposed to the first-team as first announced. The last of Stevenage's pre-arranged friendlies, against Barnet, scheduled to be played on 10 August, was also cancelled due to the 2012 Summer Olympics. Instead, it was announced that Stevenage would play Queens Park Rangers in a \\"behind closed doors\\" friendly on the same day. Stevenage's first pre-season fixture was an away trip to Conference South side Boreham Wood on 14 July, with the game ending in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Stevenage fielded two entirely different teams in each half, playing a mixture of first-team players and trialists. The home side took the lead on the half hour mark when Inih Effiong cut in from the left wing before firing into the bottom left hand corner of the goal. Shortly after the interval, summer signing Marcus Haber headed in a Filipe Morais corner to restore parity, with the game ultimately finishing at one goal apiece. The club's next pre-season fixture took place four days later, on 18 July, as Stevenage welcomed Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur to Broadhall Way. Tottenham won the match 2‚Äì0, courtesy of second-half goals from new signing Gylfi Sigur√∞sson and youngster Iago Falqu√©. Similarly to the match against Boreham Wood, Stevenage fielded two different teams in each half, with the second-half team featuring a number of trialists. The club then embarked on their pre-season tour of Dublin, arriving on 20 July and playing their first match a day later -- beating St James's Gate 7‚Äì0, courtesy of four goals from midfielder Robin Shroot, a brace from Michael Thalassitis, and a free-kick from Greg Tansey. The second, and final, game of the tour took place three days later, on 24 July, with Stevenage beating UCD 4‚Äì3 at the UCD Bowl. Marcus Haber opened the scoring when he headed in Filipe Morais' cross. The hosts replied by scoring goals either side of the interval, before Stevenage equalised through Robin Shroot. UCD replied instantly when Daniel Ledwith's left wing free-kick evaded everyone, before Shroot scored his second of the game with fifteen minutes remaining with an individual effort. Greg Tansey scored what proved to be the winner with a curling free-kick five minutes from time to ensure Stevenage won both of their games in Dublin. The team returned to England a day after their victory over UCD, and, at the end of the week, hosted an Arsenal XI side. The game ended goalless in front of a crowd of 1,068, with Arsenal's Serge Gnarby having the best effort of the game, seeing his shot rebound off the crossbar. Stevenage then lost 4‚Äì2 away to Bishop's Stortford, fielding a mixture of first-team players, trialists and members of the youth team, with Filipe Morais and Robin Shroot scoring for the away side. Three days later, on 4 August, the team drew 1‚Äì1 with Championship side Peterborough United. Greg Tansey scored Stevenage's goal, before Lee Tomlin equalised late-on. A 2‚Äì1 win over St Albans City at Clarence Park followed, both of Stevenage's goals coming from Robin Shroot. The club's final friendly, a \\"behind closed doors\\" match against Queens Park Rangers in Harlington, ended 2‚Äì2, with Stevenage coming from two goals down to draw, courtesy of second- half goals from Luke Freeman and Robin Shroot -- Shroot's tenth goal of pre- season. { style=\\"text-align: center\\" + !Game!!Date!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Goalscorers!!Notes -style=\\"background: #f3f3f3;\\" align=\\"center\\"114 July 2012Boreham WoodAway1‚Äì1310Haber -style=\\"background: #ffd0e3;\\" align=\\"center\\"218 July 2012Tottenham HotspurHome0‚Äì25,109 -style=\\"background: #d0ffe3;\\" align=\\"center\\"321 July 2012St James's GateAway7‚Äì0--Shroot (4), Thalassitis (2), Tansey -style=\\"background: #d0ffe3;\\" align=\\"center\\"424 July 2012UCDAway4‚Äì3150Haber, Shroot (2), Tansey -style=\\"background: #f3f3f3;\\" align=\\"center\\"528 July 2012Arsenal XIHome0‚Äì01,068 -style=\\"background: #ffd0e3;\\" align=\\"center\\"61 August 2012Bishop's StortfordAway2‚Äì4277Morais, Shroot -style=\\"background: #f3f3f3;\\" align=\\"center\\"74 August 2012Peterborough UnitedHome1‚Äì11,072Tansey -style=\\"background: #d0ffe3;\\" align=\\"center\\"88 August 2012St Albans CityAway2‚Äì1475Shroot (2) -style=\\"background: #f3f3f3;\\" align=\\"center\\"910 August 2012Queens Park RangersNeutral2‚Äì2--Freeman, Shroot } *Note: Stevenage goals come first. ===League One=== The 2012‚Äì13 League One fixtures were released on 18 June 2012, with Stevenage opening their league campaign at home to Carlisle United on 18 August 2012. The game ended 1‚Äì1, meaning Stevenage had drawn their opening league fixture for a fourth consecutive season. Carlisle took the lead with just twenty minutes remaining, substitute Danny Cadamarteri neatly setting Matty Robson free down the left wing, who drove the ball across goal and into the bottom corner of the net. The home side equalised two minutes before time, substitute Lucas Akins' shot was dropped by goalkeeper Adam Collin, and another substitute, Robin Shroot, was there to tap the ball in from close range. Three days later, on 21 August, Stevenage faced Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road, in the club's first away game of the campaign. The game ended 1‚Äì0 in Stevenage's favour, their first win of the league season, with Lucas Akins scoring his first goal for the club mid-way through the first half after the home side had failed to clear Luke Freeman's free-kick. The team then travelled to Oldham Athletic four days later, on 25 August, and secured a second straight 1‚Äì0 away win. The only goal of the game was scored in the first-half, from the penalty spot, by Lucas Akins after Marcus Haber had been fouled by Oldham goalkeeper Alex Cisak. The club started September with a 1‚Äì1 draw against Shrewsbury Town at Broadhall Way. The away side took the lead after just five minutes; Chris Day spilled Marc Richards' free-kick, and Paul Parry was there to prod the ball into the goal on the rebound. Stevenage equalised twenty minutes later when Darius Charles ran from his own half before striking a curling shot from 25-yards that beat Chris Weale in the Shrewsbury goal. A 2‚Äì1 away victory against recently relegated Coventry City followed on 9 September, with the game being televised live on Sky Sports. Coventry took the lead after eleven minutes when loanee David McGoldrick turned on the edge of the area, before striking a curling effort into the top corner of the goal. Stevenage equalised ten minutes later when a counterattack culminated with a Luke Freeman shot being parried into the path of an onrushing Robin Shroot, who swept the ball home from just inside the area. The comeback was completed with twenty minutes remaining, substitute Marcus Haber heading in Darius Charles' flick on from a Freeman corner. Six days later, Stevenage faced newly promoted Crewe Alexandra at Broadhall Way. Crewe started brightly and opened the scoring after just six minutes. A Gregor Robertson free-kick was blocked, but found its way to Max Clayton on the left wing, who rifled the ball across goal where A-Jay Leitch-Smith was on hand to connect from close range. Leitch-Smith doubled Crewe's advantage almost instantly, running on to a neat Chuks Aneke pass before finishing calmly with a low driven shot. Luke Freeman halved Stevenage's deficit midway through the first- half when he unleashed a shot from 25-yards, following good work from Patrick Agyemang and Lucas Akins, which left Crewe goalkeeper Alan Martin rooted to the spot. Former Stevenage loanee, Aneke, was sent-off for Crewe in the second half for a two-footed tackle on Anthony Grant. The home side made their numerical advantage count when substitute Robin Shroot scored with a neat turn and finish with ten minutes remaining. A 3‚Äì1 home victory over Walsall followed on 18 September. Robin Shroot had given Stevenage a first-half lead with a tidy finish from outside the area, before Walsall's George Bowerman equalised on the hour mark. The home side restored their lead through Greg Tansey, who scored with a driven shot from 30-yards, his first goal for the club. Lucas Akins sealed the victory late-on, when he steered in Tansey's cross at the back post. A week later, on 22 September, Stevenage drew 1‚Äì1 at Doncaster Rovers. Loan signing Oliver Risser headed Stevenage into the lead, before Doncaster's Chris Brown levelled in the second-half. The month ended with a 2‚Äì2 against Bury at Broadhall Way. The visitors, under the new management of Kevin Blackwell, opened the scoring through Tom Hopper's looping header. After the interval, Stevenage scored twice within the space of two minutes to turn the game on its head. Marcus Haber headed in Luke Freeman's corner to restore parity, before Greg Tansey scored a curling long-range strike. Bury equalised through second-half substitute Mark Cullen, to ensure a share of the spoils. Stevenage travelled to second placed Notts County to begin October, securing a 2‚Äì1 victory at Meadow Lane. The hosts missed a penalty at the start of the second-half, with Jeff Hughes' spot-kick hitting the post. They were awarded another penalty twenty minutes later; this time Jamal Campbell-Ryce stepped up and duly converted from twelve yards. Stevenage levelled with just seven minutes remaining, Lucas Akins scoring from the penalty spot after Alan Sheehan handled Marcus Haber's goal-bound effort, with Sheehan receiving a straight red card for the offence. Substitute Robin Shroot scored in injury-time to give Stevenage the win, latching onto Haber's lofted through-pass to finish calmly. Stevenage then secured a 1‚Äì0 home victory over Scunthorpe United four days later. The only goal of the game came courtesy of Greg Tansey's curling free-kick fifteen minutes from time, enough to earn the hosts their second successive win. The club's unbeaten start to the league season was ended a week later, as they fell to 1‚Äì0 defeat away to Colchester United. Stevenage had Anthony Grant sent-off early in the second half for two bookable offences, before Colchester's Sanchez Watt scored the deciding goal with a drilled finish two minutes later. Stevenage recovered from their first defeat of the season by inflicting the first home defeat of the season on MK Dons a week later, with a first-half Lucas Akins strike settling the game and ensuring a 1‚Äì0 away victory. Three days later, on 23 October, Stevenage beat Portsmouth at Broadhall Way, winning 2‚Äì1. Midfielder Filipe Morais scored his first goal for the club after fifteen minutes, heading in a Lucas Akins cross. The visitors equalised early on in the second-half when Jon Harley found space on the edge of the area and fired in a left-footed shot from 20 yards. Stevenage responded almost instantly when a Morais cross evaded everyone and found its way into the net. Just four days later, Stevenage's unbeaten home record was ended courtesy of a 4‚Äì0 loss to Swindon Town. Swindon were three goals to the good before the interval, thanks to goals from Raffaele De Vita, Matt Ritchie, and Miles Storey, with the away side also missing a penalty. Swindon substitute Adam Rooney added a fourth on the hour mark. Following the heavy home loss to Swindon, Stevenage returned to league action on 6 November, travelling to Huish Park to face Yeovil Town -- with Stevenage winning the match by a 3‚Äì1 scoreline. The visitors opened the scoring after just two minutes; Felipe Morais turning in Greg Tansey's cross at the back post. Yeovil responded instantly through Paddy Madden's scissor kick. Shortly after the interval, Lucas Akins was on hand to turn in substitute Marcus Haber's low cross, before James Dunne's deflected effort doubled Stevenage's advantage and put the game beyond doubt. Four days later, Stevenage suffered their second consecutive heavy home defeat, this time losing 4‚Äì1 to Preston North End. The away side scored early on through Stuart Beavon's powerful strike, before Stevenage's Greg Tansey briefly restored parity with a curling effort from the edge of the area. Preston regained the lead through Jack King following good work from Jeffrey Monakana ten minutes before half-time. Two second-half long- range strikes from Monakana and Nicky Wroe respectively gave Preston a comfortable win. Another defeat followed a week later, losing 4‚Äì1 away to Sheffield United. The home side took the lead on the twenty-minute mark, defender Neill Collins heading home unmarked from Ryan Flynn's centre. Stevenage equalised just before half-time, captain Mark Roberts scoring with a header from Filipe Morais' corner. The parity was short-lived, however, as Shaun Miller netted twice after the interval, before Chris Porter added a fourth late-on to ensure a routine victory. Stevenage then travelled to Bournemouth three days later, securing a 1‚Äì1 draw. The visitors took the lead mid-way through the first-half when Marcus Haber found space down the right wing, before laying the ball onto Greg Tansey, who found the net from just outside the area. Bournemouth equalised with fifteen minutes remaining, substitute Matt Tubbs heading in Lewis Grabban's cross at the back post. Another 1‚Äì1 scoreline followed when Stevenage took on league leaders Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way on 24 November. The game came to life with just ten minutes left; Tranmere striker Jake Cassidy found space in the area, and headed in Adam McGurk's cross unmarked. Stevenage then hit the post late-on through Robin Shroot, before equalising deep into stoppage time when Greg Tansey picked up Mark Roberts' pass and curled a looping shot over Owain F√¥n Williams in the Tranmere goal. The goal was Tansey's third in four games. After a two-week break, Stevenage opened December with a 2‚Äì0 away victory against bottom-of-the-table Hartlepool United. Marcus Haber scored his third goal of the season when he reacted quickest after his initial header had rebounded off the post, giving Stevenage the lead after twenty minutes. The away side doubled their advantage on the hour mark. Hartlepool's Jordan Richards was adjudged to have handled the ball in the area, and Lucas Akins scored the resultant spot-kick. A 2‚Äì1 home loss to Crawley Town followed a week later, on 15 December. The match was the first home game for Stevenage since Mitchell Cole's passing, and the occasion was marked with numerous tributes to the former Stevenage player. The home side looked on course to take the three points when Robin Shroot neatly tucked the ball home from close range following David Gray's centre. However, Crawley netted twice within the space of four second-half minutes to secure their first league win in seven games. The club's game against Brentford, scheduled to be played at Griffin Park on 22 December, was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. Stevenage returned to action on Boxing Day following an eleven-day break, losing 3‚Äì1 at home to in-form Coventry City. A first-half Lucas Akins penalty had given the hosts the lead, only for Coventry to score three times in the final ten minutes to secure all three points. Stevenage's last scheduled game of 2012, a home game against Notts County on 29 December, was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. The club had held a 9am pitch inspection on the day of the game, and deemed the surface unplayable due to heavy rainfall during the days leading up to the match. The new year began with a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Walsall at the Bescot Stadium on 1 January. A long-range Jamie Paterson strike with three minutes remaining was enough to settle the game. Four days later, Stevenage travelled to Crewe looking for their first win in a month. The game ended 2‚Äì1 to Stevenage, coming back from a first-half deficit to take all three points. Former Stevenage loanee, Chuks Aneke, had given Crewe the lead with a calm side-footed effort mid-way through the first period. Stevenage replied twice within the space of five second-half minutes; first Lucas Akins tapped in Anthony Grant's centre, before Akins' flick-on gave Marcus Haber room to run and slide the ball through Steve Phillips' legs in the Crewe goal. A week later, on 12 January, Stevenage's bad home form continued when they lost 2‚Äì1 to promotion chasing Doncaster Rovers. Doncaster, without a manager at the time of the game due to Dean Saunders leaving for Wolverhampton Wanderers, scored twice late-on to secure victory after Stevenage had led through James Dunne's powerful half-volley. The defeat meant that Stevenage were without a home win in six league matches. Stevenage's scheduled away game against Bury on 19 January was postponed as a result of heavy snowfall in the days leading up to the fixture. The Gigg Lane pitch failed an 11:30am inspection a day before the match was due to be played. After a three-week period without first-team football, Stevenage returned to action with a home game against Leyton Orient on 2 February. The game ended 1‚Äì0 to the visitors, with an early Dean Cox goal separating the two teams. New signing Ben Chorley made his debut during the match, having signed from Orient just two days earlier. Three days later, on 5 February, Stevenage secured their first home win since October, beating Notts County 2‚Äì0 at Broadhall Way. Loanee Sam Hoskins gave Stevenage the lead inside the first minute, finishing calmly after Filipe Morais' shot had deflected into his path. Substitute Marcus Haber headed in a Morais cross in the final minute to give Stevenage a two-goal cushion. The team then made the long journey north to face Carlisle United on 9 February, losing the match 2‚Äì1. Carlisle were two goals to the good within the first fourteen minutes. Striker Rory Loy gave the hosts the lead, before Lee Miller doubled their advantage from the penalty spot, with goalkeeper Steve Arnold receiving a red card for a foul on Loy that resulted in the penalty. Marcus Haber scored his second goal in as many games to reduce the deficit, but Carlisle held on for the win. Stevenage then faced their second away game in three days, travelling to Griffin Park to face promoting-chasing Brentford. The hosts secured a comfortable 2‚Äì0 victory, thanks to long-range strikes from Tom Adeyemi and Marcello Trotta. A third straight defeat followed a week later, with Stevenage losing 2‚Äì1 at home to Oldham Athletic. The home side had taken a one-goal lead into the interval, courtesy of James Dunne's neat finish from the edge of the area. However, Oldham fought back with second-half goals from Dean Furman and James Tarkowski, taking all three points and inflicting Stevenage's eighth defeat in ten matches. Another defeat followed four days later, on 23 February, this time a 2‚Äì1 loss to Shrewsbury Town at New Meadow. Similarly to their previous match against Oldham, James Dunne gave Stevenage the lead in the first-half. Shrewsbury equalised on the half hour mark, before scoring late-on to secure all three points. Stevenage then lost 1‚Äì0 to Scunthorpe United three days later, with a second-half Mark Duffy strike settling the match. The result was Stevenage's tenth defeat in twelve matches, leaving them just eight points above the relegation places. March began with a sixth straight defeat, with the club losing 2‚Äì0 at home to Colchester United. Two second-half Jabo Ibehre goals proved to be the difference. Just three days later, on 5 March, Stevenage ended their run of defeats by beating high-flying Brentford 1‚Äì0 at Broadhall Way. Having dominated the match for large spells, the home side took the lead with fifteen minutes left when Marcus Haber dinked the ball over Simon Moore in the Brentford goal. Stevenage then lost 2‚Äì0 away to Preston North End on 9 March, with goals from Lee Holmes and Will Hayhurst in the opening fifteen minutes settling the match. Another defeat followed three days later, with the club losing 1‚Äì0 at home to Bournemouth. A first- half Brett Pitman penalty was the only goal of the game, as Darius Charles was sent-off late-on for a second bookable offence. Stevenage's next match, played four days later, was a 4‚Äì0 home victory over second-placed Sheffield United. Returning from a loan spell at Barnet, striker Dani L√≥pez made his first start for the club; opening the scoring just before half-time after turning Neill Collins inside the area and beating George Long in the Sheffield United goal. He then added a second shortly after the interval when he neatly converted a chipped through ball by Gavin Mahon. L√≥pez scored his hat-trick just after the hour mark when Anthony Grant broke free and played a through ball to the Spanish forward, who then unleashed an unstoppable shot from just inside the area. Lucas Akins added Stevenage's fourth goal of the match with twenty minutes to go when he cut inside and beat Long with a low curling shot. Just three days after the club's impressive win over Sheffield United, Stevenage lost 2‚Äì0 to bottom-placed Bury at Gigg Lane. Goals from Craig Jones and Jonson Clarke-Harris, both of which coming within the final ten minutes of the match, proved to be the difference. Stevenage goalkeeper Steve Arnold also saved a first-half Steven Schumacher penalty. A day after the defeat by Bury, on 20 March, Stevenage announced that manager Gary Smith had been sacked following a run of 14 defeats in 18 games. Stevenage captain Mark Roberts was placed in caretaker charge while the club searched for a new manager, but could not prevent a 3‚Äì1 defeat by Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park on 24 March, a game that was televised live on Sky Sports. Tranmere went ahead after ten minutes when Zoumana Bakayoko tapped in from close range, before Stevenage equalised almost instantly courtesy of a curling Luke Freeman free-kick. Just three minutes later, on the fifteen-minute mark, Tranmere had regained their lead; Stevenage failed to clear a Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro shot and the ball fell to defender Ben Gibson, whose shot went in following a deflection off David Gray. Bakayoko then doubled his goal tally and Tranmere's advantage shortly before the interval when he tucked away Paul Black's through pass. Five days later, Roberts took charge of the side for their trip to Broadfield Stadium to face Crawley Town. Full back Miguel Comminges was sent-off for two bookable offences after just half an hour. Despite being a man light, Stevenage took the lead just before the interval when David Gray headed on Luke Freeman's free-kick, and Roberts was on hand to head the ball into the goal from six yards. Crawley equalised ten minutes into the second-half after Matt Sparrow tucked the ball into the bottom corner of the goal. Both sides had chances to take all three points, but the game ended 1‚Äì1. A day after the draw to Crawley, on 30 March, Stevenage announced that Graham Westley had been re- appointed as the club's new manager, his third spell in-charge of the Hertfordshire side. Westley's first game back as manager was a 1‚Äì0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April. In what was a tight match, loan signing Max Ehmer scored the decisive goal with fifteen minutes remaining; latching onto Filipe Morais' blocked shot before scoring with a first-time finish, ensuring a winning start for Westley. A 0‚Äì0 draw against Portsmouth at Fratton Park followed five days later. A game of very few goalscoring opportunities, Stevenage striker Marcus Haber had the best chance of the match, hitting the crossbar with a header in injury-time. A week later, Stevenage fell to a 2‚Äì0 home defeat by promotion-chasing Yeovil Town, with second-half goals from Sam Foley and James Hayter securing the win for the visitors. Another defeat followed a week later as Stevenage came up against another team chasing promotion, losing 3‚Äì0 to Swindon Town at the County Ground. Swindon took the lead through Aden Flint's volley after twenty minutes, before the visitors had Dani Lopez sent-off for a clash with Swindon midfielder Alan McCormack. Swindon winger Gary Roberts added a second shortly after the interval, before Flint scored his second of the game to round off a comfortable win. The season ended with a 2‚Äì0 home defeat by MK Dons on 27 April. The away side took the lead ten minutes before half-time when Patrick Bamford headed in Shaun Williams' cross. Substitute Ryan Lowe doubled the advantage late-on in the second-half. Stevenage finished their second League One season in 18th place, picking up 54 points throughout the campaign. { style=\\"text-align: center\\" +

opposition in the form of AFC Wimbledon. Unlike in previous seasons, the first round fixture turned out to be the opening game of the domestic season, as opposed to teams traditionally starting a campaign with a league match. The game ended 3‚Äì1 in Stevenage's favour, with all four goals coming in the first-half. The hosts opened the scoring after fifteen minutes when Luke Freeman drove a left-wing ball across goal, which was ultimately turned into his own net by AFC Wimbledon defender Pim Balkestein. Stevenage doubled their advantage seven minutes before the interval. AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper Seb Brown mis-timed a heavy defensive back pass, with the ball falling to debutant James Dunne, who slotted the ball into an empty net. The visitors responded immediately, Brendan Kiernan reducing the deficit when he successfully connected with a Luke Moore cross. Just four minutes later, in first-half injury time, Stevenage restored their two-goal cushion. A Greg Tansey free-kick was met on the half-volley by Marcus Haber; with Haber's volley goalbound, captain Mark Roberts slid in at the back post to ensure the ball crossed the line. Despite a number of goalscoring opportunities for the hosts in the second period, the scoreline remained the same and Stevenage progressed to the second round of the competition for the first time in their history. A day after the win over Wimbledon, on 15 August, the second round draw was made, with Stevenage being dealt another home tie, this time against Premier League opposition in the form of newly promoted Southampton. The match was played on 28 August, with Southampton running out 4‚Äì1 winners. The visitors took the lead early on in the second-half through Tadanari Lee, who swept home Billy Sharp's low cross. The away side doubled their advantage in controversial fashion when Sharp scored from a quick free- kick inside the area after referee Oliver Langford had wrongly adjudged defender Mark Roberts to have deliberately passed the ball back to goalkeeper Chris Day, who in-turn picked up the ball. Almost immediately after, Southampton scored once again, Jason Puncheon scoring with a volley from 35 yards. Substitute Michael Thalassitis scored his first goal for the club in injury-time to reduce the deficit, netting from an acute angle after good work down the right from David Gray. Southampton scored a fourth almost instantly when substitute Ben Reeves curled in a shot from the edge of the area. { style=\\"text-align: center\\" + !Game!!Date!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Goalscorers!!Notes -style=\\"background: #d0ffe3;\\" align=\\"center\\"114 August 2012AFC WimbledonHome3‚Äì12,018Balkestein , Dunne, Roberts -style=\\"background: #ffd0e3;\\" align=\\"center\\"228 August 2012SouthamptonHome1‚Äì43,062Thalassitis } *Note: Stevenage goals come first. ===FA Cup=== The club entered the 2012‚Äì13 FA Cup at the First Round stage -- only the third time the club had entered the competition at this stage since 1997. The First Round draw was made on 21 October 2012; Stevenage facing a trip to League Two side Rotherham United at the New York Stadium. The game was played on 3 November, with Rotherham running out 3‚Äì2 winners. The home side were three goals to the good before the hour mark, courtesy of a Mark Bradley strike and a brace from Lee Frecklington. Stevenage rallied late-on, scoring through a long-range strike from James Dunne and a first-time finish from Filipe Morais, but Rotherham ultimately held on to ensure Stevenage suffered an early exit from the competition. { style=\\"text-align: center\\" + !Game!!Date!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Goalscorers!!Notes -style=\\"background: #ffd0e3;\\" align=\\"center\\"13 November 2012Rotherham UnitedAway2‚Äì34,324Dunne, Morais } *Note: Stevenage goals come first. ===Football League Trophy=== The First Round draw was made on 18 August 2012, with Stevenage being dealt an away tie against League Two side Dagenham & Redbridge. The game was played on 4 September 2012, with Dagenham winning the match 3‚Äì2. The hosts took the lead after twelve minutes when Brian Woodall headed in Dominic Green's cross. Stevenage levelled through Mark Roberts, who scored from close range after the Dagenham defence had failed to clear a free- kick. The home side responded instantly with two goals in quick succession through Josh Scott and a Michael Spillane penalty. Second-half substitute Robin Shroot halved Stevenage's deficit with a driven effort fifteen minutes from time, although ultimately it was Dagenham who held on to progress to the Second Round. { style=\\"text-align: center\\" + !Game!!Date!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Goalscorers!!Notes -style=\\"background: #ffd0e3;\\" align=\\"center\\"14 September 2012Dagenham & RedbridgeAway2‚Äì3981Roberts, Shroot } *Note: Stevenage goals come first. ==League tableSeason statisticsStarts and goals=== - !colspan=\\"21\\"Players who left the club before the end of the season - - } *Note: '+' denotes appearance as a substitute. *Note: Herts Senior Cup games and statistics not included. ===End of Season Awards=== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse;

The 1910-1911 winter had left a lot of snow, so they went to work in February. Men and women worked to cut out snow blocks for their church. The finished ice church was 14m long, 7m wide and 4m high. The first worship was held on the 28th of March, 1911. The church gained attention internationally, and the group began to receive donations for construction of a stone church. ==Present day== The villagers decided to build another snow church to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of that church in 2011. However, they ran into a lack of snow. It finally snowed, though they did not make it to their hoped Christmas opening. In the early stage, Catholic leaders expressed skepticism, and the local Bishop refused to consecrate it. Eventually the new ice church was built. It cost ‚Ç¨100,000, or US $200,000 to build, using 1,400 cubic meters (49,000 cubic feet) of snow and slabs of ice. The dimensions are more than 20 meters long, 10 meters wide, and the church includes a 17-meter tower. It can seat 190 people. It's made up of about 1400 cubic meters of snow. Blue lighting elements are built into the ice, to enhance its appearance. Even before the building was completed, there was a number of requests for baptisms and weddings. The nearby Catholic Bishop of Passau, Wilhelm Schraml, initially ruled out masses, baptisms or weddings from being held at the church for theological reasons, though, worship services were allowed to be held. Before it melted, it was nicknamed \\"God's Igloo\\" by a major newspaper.

He was a member of the anti-Vietnam War groups Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the Seattle collective of Weatherman. He is most commonly noted as a member of the Seattle Seven, who was accused of, and tried for, conspiracy charges in 1970. ==Private life== Roger Lippman was born in Seattle in 1947. He went to school at Reed College in Oregon. He is one of four brothers, one of whom, David Lippman, was also active in SDS\\"The Weather Underground\\": report of the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Ninety-fourth Congress, first session. January 1975, and another, Peter Lippman, who is also a human rights activist, is a writer, journalist, and contributor for Roger's Balkan Witness website. ==Involvement with Students for a Democratic Society== While at Reed College, Lippman became the editor of an underground radical publication called, The Agitator, and became involved in radical politics as a member of SDS. In April 1968, he organized and attended the Northwest Draft Resistance Conference, where he represented the Reed College chapter of SDS. There, he published an article entitled, \\"Talking to McCarthyites about McCarthy.\\" During this time, New Left Notes, the national publication of the SDS, named Lippman as the key man for the SDS summer project in Seattle. According to released government documents, this project, \\"called for infiltration of industries and business there 'for sabotage and recruitment.'\\" That year, Lippman left his studies to devote himself to organizing for the peace movement. ==Involvement with Weatherman and the Seattle Seven== In June 1969, Lippman attended the SDS national convention at the Chicago Coliseum, which saw the disintegration of SDS into various factions. During the SDS \\"Days of Rage\\" that October, he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and mob actions. While the first charge was vacated, Lippman was convicted of mob action and sentenced to eleven days in jail and a fine of $90. On April 16, 1970, Lippman, along with members of the Seattle Liberation Front, was indicted on conspiracy charges. Lippman had been arrested in California in conjunction with an anti-war demonstration, along with his brother, David, on April 15. His co-defendants in the Seattle case were Chip Marshall, Jeff Dowd, Susan Stern, Michael Lerner, Joe Kelly, Michael Abeles, and Michael Justesen. The latter disappeared before he could be arrested. The charges stemmed from a February 1970 demonstration in Seattle, considered to be the biggest and most violent anti-war demonstration in the city at the time. It was part of a nationwide movement called \\"The Day After,\\" meant to express solidarity and outrage at the jailing of the Chicago Seven, who organized protests of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Lippman, while indicted in Seattle with his other alleged co-conspirators, had moved to San Francisco the month before to edit a radical newspaper there. In the complaint, other co-defendants were alleged to have \\"spok[en] to assemblages of persons in Seattle,\\" and \\"led a march to the United States Courthouse,\\" attempting to establish a timeline of events that culminated with property damage at the United States Courthouse and the Federal office Building. Lippman was only mentioned in the complaint as having \\"met\\" with the others on two occasions. The trial was highlighted by the antics of the defendants and their antagonistic relationship with presiding judge George Hugo Boldt. Chip Marshall acted as his own counsel, and there were multiple disruptions of the proceedings by supporters of the Seven. At one point, Jeff Dowd spread a Nazi flag in the courtroom, implying Boldt was a fascist. Violence erupted twice during the trial, resulting in injuries and contempt of court charges. Speaking about the violence in the courtroom, Lippman has said, \\"More of them ended up with bloody noses, but it was us who ended up in jail.\\" Boldt declared a mistrial on December 10, but upheld the contempt charges against the defendants. The story of the case was told in Kit Bakke's 2018 book, \\"Protest On Trial.\\" ==Life after the Seattle Seven Trial== In 1974, Lippman sued officials in the government and Richard Nixon's administration for alleged illegal wiretapping and surveillance activities. Among those named in the complaint were former Attorneys General John Mitchell, William Saxbe and Richard Kleindienst, former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Clarence Kelley, and subsidiary divisions of the Bell Telephone Company. In his suit, Lippman alleged that agents of the government, police, and FBI were responsible for illegal wiretapping activities both at the SDS national office and locally in Seattle, including activities at his home. He also alleged acts of burglary and illegal prosecution as well as the infringement of his Civil Rights. Released documents reveal that the government was at least aware of Lippman's residence as early as 1969, and referred to it as a \\"commune for SDS members.\\" In the same document, Lippman was referred to as the \\"leader of [the] Weatherman chapter in Seattle.\\" Despite the revelation of many of the activities he alleged, as well as similar crimes during the Watergate investigation, Lippman was forced to drop his suit due to lack of resources. Lippman maintains a website that contains articles he has written in his years of activism. He is also editor of Balkan Witness, a compilation of reporting and opinions on the conflicts in Kosovo and Bosnia. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:People from Sacramento, California Category:Reed College alumni Category:American anti‚ÄìVietnam War activists Category:Activists from Seattle Category:Activists from California ","title":"Roger Lippman"},{"id":"35832325","text":"Austronausibius is a genus of beetles in the family Silvanidae, containing the following species:Silvanidae Species List at Joel Hallan‚Äôs Biology Catalog.

It is the type species of Peytoia. ==History== Like other Burgess Shale anomalocarids, Peytoia nathorsti has a complicated taxonomic history. It and Laggania cambria were named in the same paper in 1911. The type specimen of Peytoia nathorsti consisted of an isolated oral cone, which Walcott interpreted as the body of a jellyfish. The type specimen of Laggania cambria was a poorly preserved body and oral cone, which Walcott interpreted as being a holothurian. In 1978, however, Simon Conway Morris recognized that the \\"mouthparts\\" of L. cambria were nearly identical to the \\"body\\" of P. nathorsti, so he suggested that L. cambria was a composite of a sponge, Corallia undulata, and a Peytoia nathorsti. Conway Morris regarded Laggania cambria as a synonym of Peytoia nathorsti, and in doing so made Peytoia nathorsti be the valid name among the simultaneously-named synonyms. In 1985, Harry B. Whittington and Derek E. G. Briggs described the first full-body specimens of Peytoia nathorsti along with the first full-body specimen of Anomalocaris canadensis. Based on the newly apparent similarities between the two species, they considered P. nathorsti to be a species of Anomalocaris, as Anomalocaris nathorsti. Finally, new data on the morphology of the oral cone of Anomalocaris canadensis confirmed that it was distinct from Peytoia nathorsti. ==References== Category:Anomalocaridids ","title":"Peytoia nathorsti"},{"id":"35832639","text":"Kerend is an alternate name of Kerend-e Gharb, a city in Kermanshah Province, Iran.

It is one of seven regional \\"third programs\\". The name reflects the fact these programs all came into existence after the Second German Channel was founded in 1961. They are organized within the federal network ARD (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der √∂ffentlich- rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, roughly \\"Working Group of Broadcasters under public jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany\\"). ==History== Germany's first regional television broadcast occurred on January 4, 1965, in northern Germany, as part of a network involving Norddeutscher Rundfunk, Sender Freies Berlin (West Berlin) and Radio Bremen. This association marks the birth of NDR Fernsehen, a television channel covering a large part of the northern Bundesl√§nder (Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Hamburg and Bremen). On January 1, 2005, NDR Fernsehen's regional broadcasts for Bremen and Bremerhaven acquired their own identity, birthing Radio Bremen TV, a television channel that took over parts of NDR Fernsehen (with which it continues its association) in addition to local productions. ==Programming== The weather forecast started at 18:10 and was followed by NDR Fernsehen, which ran from 18:15 to 18:45. This was followed by AnSichten, a new edition of Stadtschnack, which covered current news and events relevant to Bremen. On Fridays, a weekly quiz show, Sieh an, was broadcast and followed at 18:55 by a short news bulletin accompanied with sign language and produced by the buten un binnen editorial team. At 19:00, Nordl√§nder, a factual program covered interesting contributions or featured contributors relevant to the Northern German regions. The program was also set for broadcast within the NDR transmission range, the station's regional neighbour and affiliate. It aired only between Mondays and Thursdays, with its Friday time slot instead filled by Bremer Tierladen, a program covering animal issues. Sportblitz came next on the weekday schedule and would begin at 19:15, followed by another weather report at 19:25. After this, buten un binnen, the magazine show covering Bremen and Bremerhaven, would begin each day at 19:30. On the weekends, regional programming was only set to start at 18:45. On Saturdays, a broadcast chosen from the archives of Radio Bremen filled the first, early evening slot in the schedule, running until 19:30 when the latest edition of buten un binnen would follow. On Sundays, 3 nach 9 classics would commence regional programming during the day's 18:45 slot, consisting of highlights or Best-of selections from the substantial archives of 3 nach 9, Radio Bremen's flag-ship, a long-running talk show which has been aired for the last 35 years now. A new episode of buten un binnen - Das Beste followed every Sunday at 19:30, each episode themed around a new subject or issue that is examined through a collection of segments, clips and contributions from archival material covering the show's entire 30 year history and edited because of the relevance they have to the theme of the week, along with contributing to its exploration or discussion. The Sunday edition of buten un binnen itself, meanwhile, was recorded the previous day and could therefore not cover or react to events or news from the day set for its actual broadcast. Starting in September 2013, Radio Bremen TV's programming received an overhaul while the station was undergoing its own reconstitution.Radio Bremen TV ab Herbst mit neuem Vorabend DWDL.de vom 17. Juli 2013, aufgerufen am 15. Februar 2014 A result of this was that the space reserved for independent regional television broadcasts was made shorter to bring it into line with the equivalent space provided for NDR's regional stations. Following this change and now receiving less time on air, the station had to discontinue a number of programs in order to reorganize its schedule to suit the new time slots provided for it to broadcast. The station also redesigned its appearance while renovating its studios. Since these changes, the evening schedule now begins at 18:00 with a compact, six-minute edition of buten un binnen. This is followed by buten un binnen Sportblitz and buten un binnen Wetter for the day's sports news and weather forecast. Between 18:15 and 19:30 programming switches to shows from NDR Fernsehen, and this is followed by a regional magazine version of buten un binnen. Another new addition is the extension of live broadcasts to Sundays, which means that the station can now provide up- to-date coverage of any weekend sports events, instead of offering a pre- recorded news package. The pre-recorded news package could only cover things that happen a day before the actual broadcast. Radio Bremen TV's broadcast lines now terminate at 20:00 each day, with transmission switching over in time for the start of Das Erste's Tagesschau. Besides the regional channels, whose window of operation has been cut down to between 18:00 and 18:15 and then followed by a second slot from 19:30 to 20:00, the station broadcasts joint programming which has been produced in collaboration with their affiliate and neighbouring regional broadcaster, NDR Fernsehen. Radio Bremen's content, which is transmitted at the same time as this jointly produced programming, has been given the name Radio Bremen Fernsehen. ==Logos== Logo Radio Bremen TV.svg RB TV Logo.svg Radio Bremen TV OnAir Logo 2015.png2015‚Äìpresent Radio Bremen TV HD Logo 2017.png29 March 2017 ‚Äì present ==References * Category:Radio Bremen Category:ARD (broadcaster) Category:Television stations in Germany Category:Television channels and stations established in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in Germany Category:Mass media in Bremen (city) Category:German-language television stations ","title":"Radio Bremen TV"},{"id":"35832711","text":"A Member of the Third House is a novel by American author Hamlin Garland. ==Overview== In 1897, the book was published by D. Appleton and Company. The story takes place at the turn of the 20th century in New England. Widely known for producing local color fiction, Garland drifted toward a more progressive, realistic style in his later works including A Member of the Third House. The story revolves around a local politician and his conquest to destroy a railroad monopoly. The overarching plot is a clear representation of Garland's political opinions. Yet, the novel addresses many important issues at the time, which contribute to its importance in the field of American literature. ==Plot summary== The story begins in a New England metropolis. Two men are engaged in a conversation involving politics. Wilson Tuttle is a local politician who has just submitted a bill to charge an annual rent for street franchises. He has also carried a resolution to have the methods of the Consolidated Railway investigated. The Consolidated Railway owns railways in multiple cities throughout New England. The company is attempting to secure a charter to become a monopoly. The Consolidated Railway has been using the Third House to gain political support. A corrupt political group, the Third House exists between the people and the legislation. The members‚Äô support is purchased through bribes. Following his brief conversation with Mr. Holbrook, Mr. Tuttle accompanies Evelyn Ward and Helene Davis for some ice cream. Evelyn is the daughter of Senator Rufus Ward, and Helene is the daughter of Lawrence Davis, the president of Consolidated Railway. Lawrence Davis, commonly referred to as the Iron Duke, is in charge of the Third House trustees of the road. His cohorts consist of lobbyist Tom Brennan and attorney Samuel Fox. At the office of Tom Brennan and Samuel Fox, two legislators arrive for a meeting. Mr. Brennan supplies the two men food and liquor. He desires to gain their political support through the means of a bribe. His efforts are fruitful and he instructs the men to pay their money to Hilliard's, a local bar acting as home base for the Third House. Following the departure of the two legislators, Evelyn and Helene stop by to say hello to Brennan. After hearing Tuttle discuss the Third House, the women ask Brennan what he knows. He vaguely answers the question and Helene tells him how much her father praises his work. Brennan goes on to explain his thirst for power. He compares controlling the railways to controlling an army. Brennan also expresses his desire to become the superintendent of Consolidated Railways. Later that afternoon, Lawrence Davis and Samuel Fox discuss the recent state of their company. Although he appreciates his work ethic, Davis is worried about Brennan and his extreme thirst for power. Davis originally bought the Third House to support the new movement for his railways. However, he does not know how to proceed and is skeptical of Brennan's intentions. The men discuss the problematic activities of Tuttle. They know that Tuttle cannot be fixed like many other politicians. Their charter must be passed before Tuttle's bill. Evelyn's father, Senator Rufus Ward arrives at Brennan's office. Desperately seeking money for an investment, he begs for Brennan's help. Tom offers Ward money in exchange for his support. Although Ward opposes the proposed notion, his tough financial situation causes him to rethink matters. Upon Davis's arrival, Brennan makes it clear that he wants to be an official stockholder in the Consolidate Railway. He threatens to destroy Davis if his wish fails to be granted. Later that night, Tuttle, Brennan and numerous other politicians are having a Hillard House. Tuttle explains to a companion that he has a joint committee to investigate the activities of the Consolidated Railway. However, he addresses the need for an inside source. The investigation is stagnant due to lack of evidence. Driven away by the summer heat, many people relocated to the popular summer getaway of Waterside. Both Lawrence Davis and Senator Ward own property here and Brennan and Tuttle have made the trip for the weekend. Brennan, Tuttle, Evelyn, and Helene engage in a friendly game of tennis. Throughout the tennis game, the two men continually point out each other's flaws to Helene. Brennan attempts to propose to Helene, however she says she needs time. Later, Tuttle warns Helene about how he believes Brennan is using her and her father for personal gains. After dinner, Tuttle stumbles upon Mr. Davis and Mr. Fox. Tuttle's evidence has recently been published in the newspapers and Davis and Fox express their rage. Despite their anger with him, Tuttle stays strong to his beliefs and claims he will proceed with the investigation. Born in the country, Senator Ward was a simple man. His father was a carpenter and an alcoholic, a curse that Ward carried with him. Ward was an astute businessman never charged with anything except for his timid nature. Following his meeting with Brennan, his wife received a cloudy eyed, purple- faced Ward. Clearly, the meeting had taken an emotional toll on the Senator. Tuttle stops by the Ward residence to have a few words with the Senator. Mrs. Ward informs him of the current state of her husband, so Tuttle and Evelyn decide to take a walk on this warm summer evening. The two discuss Helene's relationship with Brennan and Evelyn displays her affection for Tuttle. Tuttle's investigation has hit the papers and some of his opposition is experiencing a change of heart. The public is coming to the realization that great corporations dominate the legislative halls. Regardless, the support for Tuttle is minimal and others opposing him believe that he is trying to turn the American people against the legislators. His own, local paper is even against him uncovering the power of money in this time. One of Tuttle's companions attempts to convince him to drop the investigation. His reasoning is if the public can withstand the current corrupt situation, they can too. A tenacious Tuttle insists on the continuation of the investigation. His next target is Pat Murnahn: a covert member of the Third House and a possible inside source. Tuttle yearns for more people to speak out against the Third House. In order for the success of the investigation, he must find further evidence. Tuttle is approached by an employee of the establishment who suggests he should turn his focus to Senator Ward. Supposedly, Ward has been bribed and his timid nature might make him the prime target for the investigation. Tuttle leaves the bar after receiving some encouraging advice. The mystery employee tells Tuttle a man who fights the monopolies is usually right. Senator Ward is clearly a vulnerable man. He and his wife are currently in a rough financial situation because of debt. Davis arrives at the Senator's house and the two discuss their worries for Tuttle. Davis explains without Ward's contribution the construction of their new railway would be delayed for at least ten years. Davis offers to take control of half of Ward's business in addition to making him a stockholder in exchange for his contribution. Following Davis‚Äô departure, Tuttle arrives to interrogate Ward. Tuttle explains to Ward that Senators have been bribed by members of the Third House, while under the influence of alcohol. Tuttle makes it clear that if Ward does not betray his colleagues, he will be betraying the state. Finally Ward succumbs to Tuttle's questioning and admits he indeed accepted a bribe. The investigation has finally reached the courthouse. Members of both parties stream into courthouse. Tuttle sees Ward and Evelyn arrive and take their seats inside. Ward looks sicker than ever however he insists on testifying in front of the joint committee. Once court is in session, Brennan is one of the first called to the stand. The Attorney General questions him regarding the activities of the Third House and his role in the bribing scandal. A calm and collected Brennan claims his duties with the Third House are legitimate and he denies all bribery charges. Davis is the next witness called to the stand. It becomes apparent that Davis recently bought out the Electric Motor Line for $100,000. Davis also admits that at least forty members of the Third House received bribes but does not know of any money actually paid to the house. He then lies about promising stocks and official positions with his company for political leverage. Rufus Ward is the final witness called to the stand. After his opening statement, Ward says he was offered $10,000 by Brennan and an additional $50,000 from Davis if he withdrew his opposition. Following the trial, Tuttle discovers he won. The last item on the committee's agenda is determining if any Senators need to be impeached. Tuttle is overjoyed yet worried about the condition of Ward. Upon hearing the news, Tuttle rushes to see Ward. He believes that Ward will not be criminally charged and instead recognized for his heroism. Tuttle then proceeds to visit with Helene to make sure she is ok. She greets him with a confused sense of joy and the two proceed to have dinner. They receive a telegram from Davis reassuring Helene that he will be fine. Davis, Brennan, and Fox have all been released on bail. Alone in his home, Davis uses this time to reflect on his past actions. The old man begins to realize that everything around him is falling apart. Brennan and Fox are nowhere to be found and he thinks they have skipped town. Anxiety takes over Davis's mind with the thought his daughter will soon be married and out of his life as well. He takes his revolver out of his desk and imagines the easy way out. In the bar of a local hotel, Brennan has a casual drink while talking with the bartender, a friend of Brennan's. The bartender notifies Brennan he is being followed by a detective. Brennan immediately sneaks out to the sanctuary of another hotel across town. Here he collects some necessary supplies and changes his appearance. He appears to be planning a quick getaway. After leaving this hotel, Brennan travels to see Davis. Brennan delivers Davis the unfortunate news that members of the Third House are skipping town as quickly as possible. An infuriated Davis plans to fight back. Davis believes he was wrongly forced into the bribery scandal by the current condition of the legislation. However, Brennan thinks the only option is to skip town. He proceeds to inform Davis that they could be sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Brennan says he has a boat waiting and Davis needs to come with him. Davis remains indecisive and Brennan sneaks out the back door. After a few thoughtful moments, Davis reaches for his gun and takes his life. Meanwhile, Brennan reaches the docks and breaks out into a joyous song as he boards the boat to freedom. ==The Author== Born on a farm near West Salem, Wisconsin on September 14, 1860, Hamlin Garland was an American novelist best known for his fiction involving mid-western farmers. His early years were spent on various mid-western farms but then settled in Boston, Massachusetts in 1884 to pursue a writing career. His first great success came in 1891 with Main-Travelled Roads. This was a collection of short stories inspired by his days on the farm. A socialist advocator, Garland set up an institution to dispense money to radical, liberal and trade union causes. Many of Garland's novels were criticized as being overtly political propaganda. Some of these novels include Jason Edwards (1892) and A Member of the Third House (1897). Hamlin Garland was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1922. Garland died on March 4, 1940.http://www.spartacus-educational.com/USAgarland.htm ==CharactersWilson Tuttle=== A man of wide reading and of deep enthusiasm, Wilson Tuttle is the moral compass of this novel. An astute student of politics, Tuttle fights the illegitimate actions of the Consolidated Railway and the Third House. He hopes the success of this endeavor will result in his running for Congress. Tuttle also has feelings for Senator Ward's daughter, Evelyn. ===Tom Brennan=== Hailing from a poor Irish background, Tom Brennan achieved success through his deceitful wit and charisma. Following a brief career as a lawyer, Lawrence Davis hired Brennan as a lobbyist for the railroad company. His addiction to power leads Brennan to manipulate Davis in hopes of becoming the superintendent of the company. Brennan also maintains a relationship with Davis's daughter, Helene, throughout the novel. ===Lawrence Davis=== Lawrence Davis is the powerful President of the Consolidated Railway. Davis bought political support from the Third House to monopolize his business. Despite involvement with corrupt politics, Davis is a righteous man at heart. This becomes clear when he takes his life after reminiscing about his past decisions. He is also the father of Helene Davis. ===Helene Davis=== The daughter of Lawrence Davis, Helene is a jovial young lady. She maintains a relationship with Tom Brennan throughout the novel. Despite being at the center of the political scandal, Helene's na√Øve nature creates distance between her and the situation at stake. ===Rufus Ward=== Rufus Ward is a Senator as well as the owner of a struggling business. An upstanding citizen, his only negative trait is his timid nature. Financial struggles forced him to become involved with the Third House conspiracy. Regardless, at Tuttle's request, Ward is the only one to turn against the Third House. Unlike many of the other politicians in this novel, Ward becomes the hero by staying true to his values even if it leads to his demise. He is also the father of Evelyn Ward. ===Evelyn Ward=== The daughter of Rufus Ward, Evelyn is a friend with Helene, Brennan and Tuttle. Like her father, she is a moral, selfless woman. Evelyn assists Tuttle in convincing Ward to testify in court against the Third House. Evelyn is also very fond of Tuttle. ==Themes/Analysis== A product of the realist literary movement, Hamlin Garland applies his political views to his writing. Diverting from romanticism, literary realism places importance on honesty, integrity and the rise of the common man. Set in post-Civil War New England, A Member of the Third House is a story of political warfare. Garland portrays this time as an era of decayed social and moral values poisoned with cynicism, greed and the pursuit of pleasure. Throughout the novel, Garland develops strong characters that embody the realist perspective. Furthermore, Garland couples his realist writing style with his political views. The populist outlook Garland holds urges social and political system changes that benefit the general population. The ultimate demise of the railroad monopoly and those involved epitomize Garland's political and realist views. Wilson Tuttle and Senator Ward represent the realist hero in this novel. The characters involved with the railroad business are depicted in a more romantic fashion. The realist hero cannot thrive until the heroic, self-devoted, old romantics are defeated. Garland is in fact the narrator of this story and through his writing and voice, populist and realist ideals represent the underlying themes of the novel. Garland was the father of ‚Äúveritism‚Äù. This term describes his method of composing fiction. Veritism was a form of realism that blended the realist's insistence upon verisimilitude of detail. Garland tended to depict objects as they appear to his individual eye. An interesting aspect of A Member of the Third House was Garland's portrayal of women. There were only two female characters in the story and held relatively minor roles. In many of his local color fiction works, Garland describes the female characters in a negative light. Although A Member of the Third House is not one of Garland's prototypical local color stories, he depicts the women in a similar manner. The women in the story are uneducated and na√Øve. Garland never discloses the age of the two characters. Based on their respective descriptions, they could easily be mistaken for children. In contrast, the male characters are much more emotionally and intellectually developed, hinting towards Garland's realist (veritist) perspective. ==Criticism== Being one of Hamlin Garland's less famous works, no real criticism for A Member of the Third House exists. However, Garland's writing style has been thoroughly analyzed throughout the years. Classified as a realist, Garland strongly affirmed distaste for the treatment of romantic passion in fiction.Warren French, ‚ÄúWhat Shall We Do about Hamlin Garland?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmerican Literary Realism, 1870-1910, Vol. 3, No. 4, pp. 283-289‚Äù, Fall 1970 This notion clearly appears in A Member of the Third House. A host of male characters dominate the story while the few female characters retain a limited role. Garland's abundant affectionate recollections of male comrades suggest that he was incapable of exploring publicly the importance of heterosexual intercourse. This attitude could, of course, be simply a continuation of the nineteenth-century attitudes of masculine dominance in a society. Although there is a foundation in A Member of the Third House for heterosexual romance, Garland dismisses the opportunity, placing his focus on the real, political issues at stake. Nevertheless, Garland provides countless vivid descriptions of his male characters and their interactions effectively weave together the story. == References Works Cited=== * *http://people.uncw.edu/newlink/garland/Books/culbert/GCThird_House_1892.jpg *Warren French, ‚ÄúWhat Shall We Do about Hamlin Garland?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmerican Literary Realism, 1870-1910, Vol. 3, No. 4, pp. 283-289‚Äù, Fall 1970 *Ed.

In a career which lasted from June 1992 until September 1994, he ran fifteen times and won five races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three-year-old in 1993, the same year in which he won the Lingfield Derby Trial and the Great Voltigeur Stakes. In the following season he failed to win in six races, although he finished second in the Eclipse Stakes. He later had some success as a sire of National Hunt winners. ==Background== Bob's Return was a dark brown horse with a small white star bred by the Baronrath stud at Straffan in County Kildare. In colouring and markings, he closely resembled his sire Bob Back, who defeated Pebbles at Royal Ascot in 1985, and was a successful sire of both flat racers and jumpers. Bob's Return was the first foal of his dam, Quality of Life, and was described as being \\"unfashionably bred\\". He was sent as a yearling to the Goffs sales in October 1991, where he was bought for IR¬£14,500 by Mark Tompkins who trained him at his Flint Cottage stables. The colt was bought by Mr G. A. E. Smith and given as a present to wis wife Jackie, in whose colours he ran during his racing career. Bob's Return, who usually raced in a sheepskin noseband, was ridden in every one of his fifteen races by Philip Robinson. ==Racing career1992: two-year-old season=== Bob's Return made his racecourse debut in a five furlong maiden race at Beverley in June 1992 in which he finished fourth behind Rock Symphony. He missed the next three months before starting 9/4 favourite for a maiden race at Yarmouth. He finished fourth of the sixteen runners behind Racing Telegraph. In October, Bob's Return was sent to Pontefract and recorded his first victory, winning by a length from Brown's and nineteen others. On his final race of the season, Bob's Return was moved up in class and sent to Newmarket to contest the Listed Zetland Stakes. He led from the start and won by three quarters of a length from Bobbie Dee. ===1993: three-year-old season=== Bob's Return began his three-year-old season in the Derby Trial at Lingfield Park Racecourse on 8 May. Robinson took Bob's Return to the lead early on, and the colt went clear in the straight before staying on to win by a neck from Tioman Island at odds of 14/1. Bob's Return made his next appearance in the Derby at Epsom for which he was made the 15/1 fifth choice in the betting in a field of sixteen colts. He led the field into the straight but weakened in the closing stages and finished sixth, fourteen lengths behind the winner Commander in Chief. Bob's Return was off the course for two and a half months before reappearing in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse in August. Although he started a 16/1 outsider he was always among the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and drawing clear of his opponents to win by six lengths from Foresee. In the Coalite-sponsored St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse on 11 September, Bob's Return started 3/1 favourite ahead of the Henry Cecil-trained Armiger. Robinson tracked the leaders, before moving the favourite into the lead three furlongs from the finish. Bob's Return stayed on strongly in the straight to win by three and a half lengths from Armiger. On his final race of the season, Bob's Return was dropped back in distance to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. He briefly led the field in the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished sixth, beaten four lengths behind the winner Urban Sea. Bob's Return was the highest rated European three-year-old at distances of fourteen furlongs and above. ===1994: four-year-old season=== Bob's Return ran six times as a four-year-old without success, beginning with a fourth place behind Romildo in the Prix Ganay. He showed improved form in his next two races, finishing second in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot and second to Ezzoud in the Eclipse stakes at Sandown. His remaining starts were disappointing as he finished unplaced in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, the International Stakes and the Irish St. Leger. ==Stud career== Bob's Return retired to stand at stud in Britain at a fee of ¬£2,250. The Independent described his \\"bargain basement\\" fee as being a reflection of the unfashionable status of proven stayers as stallions. He attracted few mares and was transferred to the Kilbarry Lodge Stud in County Waterford in Ireland where he proved more popular. He sired few flat winners, but was more successful as a National Hunt stallion. His most successful offspring was the Irish steeplechaser Joncol, winner of the Hennessy Gold Cup (Ireland) and the John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase. Bob's Return died in 2008. ==Pedigree References == Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:1990 racehorse births Category:2008 racehorse deaths Category:Thoroughbred family 1-w Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Bob's Return"},{"id":"35832757","text":"Eutermicola sculpticollis is a species of beetles in the family Silvanidae, the only species in the genus Eutermicola.Silvanidae Species List at Joel Hallan‚Äôs Biology Catalog.

Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows, including Today and the 2012 BET Awards. ==Background and release== \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" was written by Alain Whyte, Alessandro Benassi, Brian Kennedy, Chris Brown, Jean- Baptiste, Marco Benassi, Michael McHenry, Nick Marsh, Priscilla Hamilton, Ryan Buendia and William Orbit. It was produced by Benny and Alle Benassi, David Guetta, Free School, Orbit and Kennedy. \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" was originally intended for American pop singer Madonna's twelfth studio album MDNA (2012); however, she could not record the song because of her tight schedule, and Orbit gave the song to Brown. After an unofficial version of \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" was leaked online in January 2012, websites reported that the song was produced by David Guetta. However, Guetta said on his Facebook and Twitter accounts, \\"I'm credited for 'Don't Wake Me Up' ... but I did not produce this record. Best to CB!\\". On May 12, 2012, Brown announced on his Twitter account that he would release \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" as the next single from his fifth studio album Fortune. It was made available for download via iTunes Stores worldwide on May 18, 2012. The Free School/William Orbit remix of the song was released in some European countries on May 22, 2012. In the United States, \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" was sent to contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on June 12, 2012. On June 22, 2012, it was released as a CD single in Germany and as a Digital EP in the United Kingdom. The EP contains the album version, remix and Brown's previous singles \\"Till I Die\\" and \\"Sweet Love\\". It is the 10th track on Now That's What I Call Music! 44. ==Composition and lyrics== \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" is an EDM song that features heavy bass; it lasts for 3 minutes and 42 seconds. The instrumentation is provided by an acoustic guitar and synthesizers. Brown uses auto-tune on the hook and breakdown. \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" is written in the key of B‚ô≠ major and is set in common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Brown's vocal range spans from the note of G4 to the note of C6. The song contains lyrics about a lost loved one who exists only in a dream, as stated by Brittany R. Villalva of The Christian Post. \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" begins with a spoken introduction by an unidentified woman saying, \\"Dearly Beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams, don't wake me up\\". Robbie Daw of Idolator compared her voice to that of Rihanna. The song's chorus consists of the hook \\"Don't wake me up\\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that the chorus \\"flourishes into a pulse-racing mix of thundering beats and squiggly electronic swizzles\\". HitFix's Melinda Newman noted that the song \\"resembles the sweet bounciness of 'Forever'\\". == Music video == A screenshot of the music video, featuring Brown and the woman lying in bed with electrodes attached to their heads. ===Background=== The accompanying music video for \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed in a desert on May 14, 2012. Several images from the shoot, showing Brown posing shirtless against a vintage car, and images of Brown posing with model Araya Nicks, who plays his love interest in the video, were posted on the Internet the following day. The video premiered online on June 11, 2012. Later that day, Brown made a guest appearance on 106 & Park and discussed the video's concept: > With this video, we wanted to go completely into the dream world. A lot of > my videos from 'Turn Up the Music' and other videos I'm doing now are in a > dream state of believing what you want to believe. So that's what Fortune > kinda encompasses. So it's basically dreaming and accomplishing your dreams. > This video is me dreaming and being taken into this whole kind of maze. I > keep waking up within a dream within a dream, almost on some Inception type > ... but I don't want to bite that. ===Synopsis=== The video begins with Brown singing alone in a desert in front of a sunset backdrop. It then cuts to Brown waking up in a bedroom as he notices a mysterious woman (played by Araya Nicks) walking through the first of three doors behind him. Each door is labeled with hieroglyphics in gold. During the first chorus, Brown follows the woman through the door and enters a garden maze. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing in the desert. He then returns to bed as the woman walks through the second door. Brown follows her again and appears in a city in the sky. This scene is also intercut with scenes of him in the desert. During the second chorus, Brown is hit by a tidal wave which sends him back to bed. He then enters the third door and appears driving a vintage car in the desert. Brown drives after the woman until he hits a sign that reads \\"Road Closed\\", which causes him to drive off a cliff. The video then cuts to Brown and the woman lying in bed with electrodes attached to their heads. ===Reception=== Nicole Sia of Idolator called the clip Brown's \\"Video of the Year\\" and complimented its \\"stunning dream imagery\\". A writer for The Edge called it \\"another visually tantalising music video\\" from Brown, while Rap-Up described it as surreal. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush described the video as \\"good visual fun\\" and wrote that it reminded him of the television series Day Break. He compared the ending to the 1999 film The Matrix. The video was nominated for World's Best Video at the 2012 World Music Awards. ==Live performances== On June 8, 2012, Brown performed \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" on Today as part of its Summer Concert Series, for which he wore a New York Yankees cap, a multicolored Snow Beach Polo jacket, black jeans and white sneakers. The set list also included \\"Turn Up the Music\\", \\"Yeah 3x\\" and \\"Forever\\". At the 2012 BET Awards ceremony on July 1, 2012, Brown performed \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" and \\"Turn Up the Music\\", for which he appeared shirtless with half his body painted gray. Brown performed acrobatic moves with six backup dancers under triangle-shaped beams as green and red flashing lights appeared throughout the stage. Georgette Cline of The Boombox wrote that Brown \\"put on an energetic show\\" and described his dance routines during the performance as \\"eye-catching\\". ==Critical reception== Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it \\"this summer's biggest anthem\\", awarding the song five stars out of five and writing that Brown delivers it \\"with effortless swagger\\". JusMusic of Singersroom described \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" as a \\"fun and bubbly track\\", while a writer for Rap-Up labeled it as an \\"electrifying Top 40 record\\". Robbie Daw of Idolator complimented the song's production as a \\"strobe light thumper\\" and wrote that if listeners enjoy Brown's auto-tuned tracks, \\"then you won't be disappointed\\". Time's Melissa Locker viewed \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" and \\"Turn Up the Music\\" as the only potential hits from Fortune. Nick Levine of BBC Music called the song \\"a smash\\". AOL Radio's Phil Kukawinski noted that \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" has \\"a nice juxtaposition of calm and energetic\\" and that it \\"seems to be one of those songs that merges the two sounds in a perfect way\\". James Reed of The Boston Globe called the song \\"a thumping club cut that's irresistible\\". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush described \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" as a \\"fist-pumping club jam\\" but felt that it is \\"not as catchy as 'Beautiful People'\\". In a review of Fortune, Barry Walters of Spin magazine wrote that \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\", along with \\"Sweet Love\\" and \\"Till I Die\\", contain \\"thin melodies and stock shock lyrics\\" that make Brown's previous singles sound better. \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" was nominated for World's Best Song at the 2013 World Music Awards. ==Chart performance== In New Zealand, \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" debuted at number 34 on May 28, 2012, and peaked at number two in its eighth week on the chart.

It contains a single species, Yurgovuchia doellingi. The remains were discovered in Utah, United States. ==Discovery and naming== Skeletal composite showing the known fossil elements of Y. doellingi The holotype was collected by Donald D. DeBlieux in 2005, from Don‚Äôs Place, part of the Doelling‚Äôs Bowl bone bed in Grand County, Utah. This bone bed is in the lower Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, dating probably to the Valanginian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, about 139-134.6 million years ago. Yurgovuchia was first described and named by Phil Senter, James I. Kirkland, Donald D. DeBlieux, Scott Madsen and Natalie Toth in 2012 and the type species is Yurgovuchia doellingi. The generic name is derived from the Ute word yurgovuch, meaning coyote, a predator of similar size to Y. doellingi which currently inhabits the same region. The specific name, doellingi, honors the geologist Helmut Doelling, for his 50-plus years of geological research and mapping of Utah for the Utah Geological Survey and for causing the discovery of the Doelling‚Äôs Bowl dinosaur sites, in which Y. doellingi was collected. ==Description== Yurgovuchia is known only from a single individual represented by an associated partial postcranial skeleton. The holotype and the only known specimen, UMNH VP 20211, includes cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae as well as the proximal end of a left pubis. The preserved vertebrae are fused, indicating that the specimen was an adult at the time of death and not a juvenile specimen of Utahraptor. Instead of this, it represents a smaller and different species of dromaeosaurid, with an estimed size of . Life restoration of an individual According to its describers in 2012, Yurgovuchia can be recognised from other dromaeosaurid taxa by the following characteristics: each side of the axial centrum have a single pneumatopore, third cervical vertebra with cranial end of the centrum not beveled, cervical prezygapophyses is flexed, cervical vertebrae epipophyses is above the postzygapophyseal facets, the pubis lacks pubic tubercle, the cranial faces of the centrum of caudal vertebrae are round, the cervical and dorsal vertebrae preserve hypapophyses without pneumatopores, the caudal prezygapophyses is distally elongated to the transition point, but not surpassing the length of a centrum. ==Classification== According to the phylogenetic analysis performed by its describers in 2012, Yurgovuchia represents advanced dromaeosaurines, closely related to Achillobator, Dromaeosaurus and Utahraptor. Below are the results obtained: ==Paleoecology== Yurgovuchia compared to the fauna of the Yellow Cat Member from the Cedar Mountain Formation (Yurgovuchia in salmon) Other dinosaurs are also known from Don‚Äôs Place including the iguanodontians Iguanacolossus, polacanthines, and velociraptorine dromaeosaurids represented by a pubis (UMNH VP 21752) and a tentaive radius (UMNH VP 21751). Many additional theropods have previously been described from the Yellow Cat Member, including the therizinosaur Falcarius and the small, predatory troodontids Geminiraptor from the lower part of the member, in addition, the large dromaeosaurines Utahraptor, small ornithomimosaurs Nedcolbertia and unnamed eudromaeosaurs represented by a tail skeleton (UMNH VP 20209) from the upper part of the member. Yurgovuchia shared its environment and lived alongside other dinosaurs in the Lower Yellow Cat, such as the theropods Falcarius and Geminiraptor, the sauropods Mierasaurus and the large iguanodontians Iguanacolossus.

Chesnutt. It was published in 1900 by Houghton, Mifflin and Company. The story occurs in the southern American states of North and South Carolina a few years following the American Civil War. Rena Walden, a young woman of mixed white and black ancestry, leaves home to join her brother, who has migrated to a new city, where he lives as a white man. Following her brother's lead, Rena begins living as a white woman. The secret of her identity leads to conflict when she falls in love with a white aristocrat who learns the truth of her heredity. The ensuing drama emphasizes themes of interracial relations and depicted the intricacies of racial identity in the American south. According to Hollis Robbins, the two major influences on The House Behind the Cedars are Chesnutt's life and Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe.https://books.google.com/books?id=QHCADwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT154&lpg;=PT154&dq;=%22hollis+robbins%22+%22walter+scott%22&source;=bl&ots;=gaWWphSqCa&sig;=ACfU3U1DzfRS5NjfksEXQKhrY_dqgo5N1Q&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjB3deJn8bjAhUNEXwKHVE5C1EQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false  ‚ÄúThe Marrow of Allusion: Charles W.

Chesnutt\\", 375. ==Plot summary== The novel opens \\"a few years after the Civil War.\\"Charles W. Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars (Boston: Houghton Mifflin and Co., 1900) 1. John Warwick walks around the town in which he used to live and visits his childhood home. John joyfully reunites with his mother, Molly, and his sister Rena, and tells them what his life has been like since leaving home. He reveals that he has become a successful lawyer, and that he was married, but his wife died and left him with a baby boy. Warwick asks Rena to come live with him and help take care of his son Albert. The narrator slowly reveals to the reader that John and Rena are mixed-race: their mother is black and their father (now dead, and never married to their mother) was white. Rena says goodbye to her mother and Frank Fowler, one of their workmen who is a close friend of the family and is deeply in love with Rena. She and her brother make the journey back to South Carolina. Upon their arrival, John and Rena attend a tournament where men dressed as knights participate in a jousting competition. There Rena meets George Tryon, who wins the tournament, invites Rena to the ball, and falls in love with her. Rena agrees to marry George, but is anxious that he will discover her African American heritage. John and George are called away on legal business, and while they're gone, Rena is haunted by three dreams that her mother is sick and dying. She then receives a letter from her mother revealing that she is indeed very ill, so Rena immediately boards a train back home. While Rena is gone, George returns and then is sent off on another errand‚Äîto Rena's hometown. After a couple of near-misses, George discovers Rena at home and learns that she has been pretending to be 100% white. Rena faints and George is devastated by the fact that Rena has deceived him about her identity. He cannot allow their relationship to continue and he writes a letter to John stating that he will not marry Rena, but will keep their family secret. John tries to convince Rena to move away with him to start a new life, but Rena does not want to leave her mother again. Molly's friend visits and asks if Rena would be interested in accompanying her cousin, Jeff Wain, in teaching at his school for colored children. Rena travels with Wain and takes her teacher's examination, where the administrator suggests that Wain is not to be trusted. A visitor enters the schoolhouse one day and tells Rena that she would like to help support the school. She also informs Rena that Jeff Wain is not a widower, but rather he beat his previous wife so badly that she left him. After hearing about Wain's history, Rena is afraid to be left alone with him. Walking home from school one day, Rena sees George approaching her from one direction while Wain is advancing towards her from the other direction. In a panic, she runs into the woods, where she becomes unconscious and, subsequently, very ill. Friend of the family Frank Fowler finds Rena and takes her home, where she wastes away. She dies just as George arrives to re- pledge his love for her. ==Characters== *Rowena (Rena) Walden ‚Äì (named after Walter Scott's Rowena), a young woman who is \\"strikingly handsome, with a stately beauty seldom encountered‚Ä¶ she walked with an elastic step that revealed a light heart and the vigor of perfect health\\".Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 5. She is the younger sister of John Warwick and daughter of Molly Walden. Although she is of mixed blood, and thus considered to be a colored woman (or mulatto), her skin is light enough that she may pass as a white woman. Rena becomes engaged to George Tryon, but after he discovers her family history, their relationship ends and she moves with Jeff Wain to become a schoolteacher for colored children. *George Tryon ‚Äì young man of 23, who is described as \\"a tall, fair young man, with gray eyes, and a frank, open face\\".Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 35. He is a close friend of John Warwick, and falls in love with Rena when he first meets her at the Clarence tournament. His mother wants him to marry Blanche Leary, but he has his heart set on marrying Rena. When he finds out that she is not white, he leaves her, but continues to love her despite her race. *John Warwick ‚Äì Rena's 28-year-old brother who moved away from home when he was younger in order to become a successful lawyer in South Carolina. John is a protective brother who wants Rena to have a new life and be afforded all the opportunities she deserves. Like Rena, his skin allows him to pass as a white man, but he must stay away from Patesville to conceal his identity. He was married, but his wife died and left him with a young son named Albert. *Molly Walden ‚Äì John and Rena's mother who is also of mixed race and comes from a family of prosperous, free African Americans. After John leaves home, she is left alone with Rena in the house behind the cedars. Her illiteracy plays a hand in causing the main conflict of the story since she is unable to read Judge Straight's letter warning her to keep Rena at home. *Frank Fowler ‚Äì a black workman for the Walden family who grew up with Rena and is in love with her. He is strongly devoted to the Waldens and would do anything for Rena. When Molly Walden is left alone, he helps take care of her and reads/writes her letters. *Jeff Wain ‚Äì mulatto man who owns the schoolhouse Rena teaches in, and the man Molly wants Rena to marry. Although on first impression he is polite and gracious, he becomes a character of suspicion. \\"Upon a close or hostile inspection there would have been some features of his ostensibly good-natured face‚Äîthe shifty eye, the full and slightly drooping lower lip‚Äîwhich might have given a student of physiognomy food for reflection\\",Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 143. and Rena becomes afraid to be left alone with him. He claims to be a widower, but Mrs. Tryon explains that his wife is not dead, but left him because she was physically abused. *Judge Archibald Straight ‚Äì John Warwick's mentor who promised John's father that he would help provide for his children. He advised John to move away so that he could pass as white and become a lawyer, and tried to prevent Rena and George from meeting in Patesville. ==Major themesRacial relations in post-Civil War South=== This novel centrally addresses the relationships between whites and African-Americans in the post-Civil War South. Those who were freed after the war no longer belong to white families; however, the text demonstrates that some still consider themselves to be in a subordinate position to their white masters. For example, Plato, one of Rena's students who used to belong to Tryon, continues to call George \\"master\\" despite the fact that he is now free. His friend reminds him, \\"'Wat you callin' dat w'ite man marster fur?' whispered a tall yellow boy to the acrobat addressed as Plato. 'You don' b'long ter him no mo'; you're free, an' ain' got no sense ernuff ter know it.'\\"Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 160. Similarly, Frank feels obliged to continue to serve the Waldens (Rena in particular) as he always did: \\"A smile, which Peter would have regarded as condescending to a free man, who since the war, was as good as anybody else; a kind word, which Peter would have considered offensively patronizing... were ample rewards for the thousand and one small services Frank had rendered the two women who lived in the house behind the cedars\\".Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 25. The events that transpire in The House Behind the Cedars emphasize the extent to which race relations are strained in the South despite any progress that has been made since the war. Tryon refuses to even think about colored people, and becomes enraged when just the voice of a colored girl interrupts his daydream. Upon discovering that Rena is not of pure white blood he decides that she \\"was worse than dead to him; for if he had seen her lying in her shroud before him, he could at least have cherished her memory; now, even this consolation was denied him\\".Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 98. He claims that he could overlook any other flaw, including illegitimate birth, but race could not be ignored. Even Molly Walden, who is of mixed race, and thus would not have any personal issues with African- Americans, acknowledges the ridiculousness of choosing to live as a black person if given the opportunity to be white. When Frank offers to drive across the world for Rena, Molly laughs and thinks, \\"\\"Her daughter was going to live in a fine house, and marry a rich man, and ride in her carriage. Of course a negro would drive the carriage, but that was different from riding with one in a cart\\".Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 26. However, there are also white characters in the story who display a more positive attitude toward non- white citizens. Judge Straight has acted as a mentor and friend to John Walden, fully aware of his racial identity. Rather than being repulsed by the idea of a successful mulatto lawyer, he encourages John to move away and pretend to be white. Furthermore, Mrs. Tryon visits Rena's colored schoolhouse (and is the first white woman to do so) offering to assist with the school and taking interest in the students and the nobility of Rena's educating them. ===Racial identity=== Drawing on Ivanhoe's dramatization of racial politics (Jewish, Norman, Saxon) Chesnutt examines passing as white and how outsiders' perspectives of a person who does so are affected. It is evident through the story that the ability to pass as a white person is correlated with success. John is able to take advantage of his fair skin and move to South Carolina and become a prominent white lawyer. Similarly, Rena is able to follow in his footsteps and climb the ranks of white society. Both are well-educated and exceedingly intelligent. Their mulatto mother, on the other hand, is of darker skin and is completely illiterate. Though she encourages her children's education, she has not received much of her own. Chesnutt's story uses characters' passing as white to illustrate traditional expectations of each race. This is particularly highlighted by Mrs. Tryon's appearance in Rena's school where she is surprised by Rena's refined manner which was \\"not merely of fine nature, but of contact with cultured people; a certain reserve of speech and manner quite inconsistent with Mrs. Tryon's experience of colored women\\".Chesnutt, The House Behind the Cedars 163. ==Critical reception== Much effort was made for Chesnutt to build this story into a publishable novel. The House Behind the Cedars was originally a short story called \\"Rena\\", and only after several revisions and converting the manuscript into a novel was it accepted by Houghton Mifflin in 1900.Robert P. Sedlack, \\"The Evolution of Charles Chesnutt's the House Behind the Cedars\\", CLA Journal 29.2 (1975): 126. This novel was controversial in its way of addressing racial tensions, miscegenation, and non-whites passing for white people. Furthermore, Chesnutt was one of the only writers who encouraged the idea that people of mixed race had \\"a morally and socially defensible argument, if not a natural right, to be accepted as white.\\"William L. Andrews, \\"Charles W. Chesnutt\\", Africam American Writers, ed. Valerie Smith, 2 ed., vol. 1 (New York Scribner's Sons, 2001) 115. Overall, though, he received somewhat mixed reviews. Some critics felt that The House Behind the Cedars was not as well written as his previous short stories, while others considered it to be successful in addressing a prevalent social phenomenon.Andrews, \\"Charles W. Chesnutt\\", 116. A reviewer from The Chicago Daily Tribune argued that although the story was well composed, the novel lacked \\"freshness and originality\\".\\"Race Problem in a Novel\\", Chicago Daily Tribune (1872-1922) 10 Nov. 1900. The Detroit Free Press described it as \\"a story of sustained strength and interest, wrought out to an artistic finale\\", and \\"easily the most notable novel of the month\\".\\"An Issue in the Race Problem\\", Detroit Free Press 11 Nov. 1900. Additionally, the Boston Evening Transcript noted that Chesnutt addressed the race problem in the South with \\"marked ability\\" and \\"may be taken as symbolical of what the author regards as the eventual solution of the race question\\".\\"Review of The House Behind the Cedars\\", Boston Evening Transcript 31 Oct. 1900. Chesnutt received praise from The Nation review, but the critic asserted that \\"[Chesnutt] probably has but faint hope of upsetting social beliefs\\".\\"Book Review of the House Behind the Cedars\\", Nation 72.1861 (1901). ==Sales== The House Behind the Cedars was not a financial success. Although it was popular enough for Houghton Mifflin to publish Chesnutt's future novels, not many copies were sold. Ultimately, none of his novels generated enough revenue for Chesnutt to maintain his lifestyle and to devote his entire career to writing.Carol B. Gartner, \\"Charles Chesnutt: Novelist of a Cause\\", Critical Essays on Charles W. Chesnutt, ed. Jr. Joseph R. McElrath (New York G.K. Hall & Co., 1999) 167. The mild popularity of his novels did not last long, since only one of Chesnutt's works remained in print at the time that he died.\\"The Literary Canonization of Charles Chesnutt\\", The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education.37 (2002): 49. ==Adaptation== Chesnutt's novel was loosely adapted into a film under the same name directed by African-American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux in 1927. The silent film starred Shingzie Howard as Rena Walden, Lawrence Chenault as the white aristocrat, and C.D. Griffith as Frank Fowler.Hans J. Wollstein, \\"House Behind the Cedars (1924)\\", The New York Times, May 12, 2012 . In this adaptation, Rena, who still passes for white, is proposed to by a white millionaire who does not know her background. However, she ultimately returns to her lover Frank Fowler, who is gaining higher status in society.The House Behind the Cedars, dir. Micheaux Oscar, Micheaux Film Corp., 1924. Micheaux later remade the film five years later under the title Veiled Aristocrats with significant plot changes to the novel. ==NotesBibliography== *\\"Book Review of the House Behind the Cedars.\\" Nation 72.1861 (1901): 182.

The culture, with its megalithic mausolea, flourished between the 12th and 8th centuries BCE.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1132 The culture was discovered, first excavated, and published in the 1930s-1940s by M.P. Gryaznov, who took it for a local version of Karasuk culture. In 1979 the Begazy-Dandybai culture was described and analyzed in detail in a monograph by A.Kh. Margulan, who systematically reviewed accumulated material and produced description of the archeological culture.Margulan A.Kh., \\"Begazy-Dandybaev culture of Central Kazakhstan\\", Alma-Ata, 1979 The most famous monuments of Begazy-Dandybai culture are Begazy, Dandybai, Aksu Ayuly 2, Akkoytas, and Sangria 1.3, it was named after the first two archeological sites. Begazy- Dandybai culture is known from the 2nd millennium BCE with mining copper, tin, and gold ore deposits. At that time in steppe oases along small rivers lived fairly numerous Andronovo culture population with farming, pastoral animal husbandry, mining, metallurgy and metal processing economy. Prosperity of Central Kazakhstan Andronov culture was provided by livestock and bronze casting production. A rise of Bronze Age culture falls at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE, 10th-8th centuries BCE, the highlight of the Begazy- Dandybai archaeological culture.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1132 It grew in vast hilly steppe, spread over approximately 2 million square kilometers, with immense pastures and numerous ore deposits.http://kzref.narod.ru/baza/histkaz/histkaz013.htm (In Russian) Archeological research of the post-1980s expanded the known locations of Begazy-Dandybai culture to 60+ settlements and 200+ cemeteries. Archeological attention shifted from fairly well studied megalithic mausolea as main attraction to the settlements and kurgan cemeteries of the commoners. Excavated settlement area amounts to several tens of thousands square meters, burial kurgans of ordinary tribal people have been partially uncovered.http://kzref.narod.ru/baza/histkaz/histkaz013.htm ==Kurgan burials== Most of the Begazy-Dandybai burials are in kurgans. At present, the kurgan brials of the commoners are known from accompanying inventory. During Begazy- Dandybai era burial began appearing kurgans with single burial. The rich burials testify to income inequality and social stratification.http://kaz- ekzams.ru/str1.html (In Russian) By the same time are dated numerous mengirs.http://www.testent.ru/publ/istoriya_kazahstana/begazy_dandybaevskaja_kultura_centralnogo_kazakhstana/25-1-0-1837 (In Russian) ==Megalithic mausolea== Most visible monuments are about 20 constructively and architecturally unusual megalithic mausolea. As a rule, mausolea are fenced with square or oval layout of two or three stone masonry walls or stone slabs up to 3 tons each encircling a central room and covered by slabs as a perimeter gallery with diameter up to 30 m, and with occasional entrance chamber. The central roof-covered chamber is built with stones and multiple square pillars that support the roof, enclosing a massive sarcophagus. Mausolea are surrounded by ordinary kurgan burials. The cemeteries are close to large settlements extending to 10 ha., with housesbuilt of granite slabs, with pillars and thick walls, connected by corridors.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1132 ==Art== Begazy- Dandybai culture preserved artifacts of the Bronze Age, and at the same time forms archaeological features of the Early Iron Age. The accompanying burial inventory has richly decorated vessels notable for thin-wall pottery, polished surface, geometric ornamentation, and tamga-type characters on the surface, along with rough ceramics of proto-Tasmola type. The Begazy mausoleum produced tanged bronze arrowheads, which typologically indicated the upper date of the culture, its architecture and housing are notable for their innovations.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1132 Pottery, and bronze and golden ware deposited in mausolea found its influence in the succeeding nomadic Tasmola culture.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1132 Begazy- Dandybai people produced jewelry: silver and gold bracelets, rings, charms, pendants, earrings, buckles, and diadems (of approximately 86% gold, 13% silver and 1% copper).http://www.testent.ru/publ/istoriya_kazahstana/begazy_dandybaevskaja_kultura_centralnogo_kazakhstana/25-1-0-1837 ==Population== Begazy-Dandybai villages were located at the feet of rocky hills, close to plentiful sources of water and fuel. In the Tokraun, Nura, Sary Su, Atasu, Ishim, Selety, and other valleys were densely located villages of ancient miners and metallurgists. Begazy-Dandybai people produced pots, pitchers, bowls, cups, vessels with spouts, etc. Ceramic pots were fired globular jugs with high neck and collar rim. Ceramic was made of clay mixed with granitic sand. Grave inventory and dwellings contain many metal and bone tools: bronze pins, needles, buttons, linings, bone needle boxes, and buttons. Large number of tools was used in mining: hammers, picks, hoes, graters, mortars, pestles, and stone molds.http://www.testent.ru/publ/istoriya_kazahstana/begazy_dandybaevskaja_kultura_centralnogo_kazakhstana/25-1-0-1837) ==Economy== Evidence shows developed economy with hoe agriculture, irrigation, animal husbandry, and non ferrous metals production.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1132 It is thought that in the Late Bronze Age (20th ‚Äî 8th centuries BCE) arose nomadic pastoralism of yaylaj type (distant summer pastures), which led to increase in livestock productivity, with grows of livestock herds. The population continued irrigation farming.http://www.testent.ru/publ/istoriya_kazahstana/begazy_dandybaevskaja_kultura_centralnogo_kazakhstana/25-1-0-1837) ==Related cultures== The Andronovo culture is held to be a predecessor of the Begazy-Dandybai culture,https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1132 among others. Begazy-Dandybai sites, usually located in mountainous areas surrounded by dry steppes, were succeeded in the same territory by pastoralist nomadic cultures. These included the: * Tasmola culture, which was dispersed throughout central Kazakhstan in the Karaganda, Akmola, and Pavlodar provinces, and; * Pazyryk culture of the Altay Mountains. While the megalithic architecture of Begazy-Dandybai was unique, other aspects of its material culture were similar to the contemporaneous Karasuk culture and to that of Tasmola. In the absence of further evidence, there is no consensus on the historic identity, cultural connections or genetics of the Begazy-Dandybai culture. Scholarly opinions are divided between theories of a predominantly indigenous origin and a predominantly external origin.http://kzref.narod.ru/baza/histkaz/histkaz013.htm The ancient tribes of the Kazakhstan Bronze Age were descendants of the Kazakhstan Neolithic population, and became ancestors of the Sakas, Usuns, and Kangly tribes. ==ReferencesLiterature== * Margulan A.H., Begazy-Dandybaevskaya Kultura Tsentralnogo Kazakhstana, Alma-Ata: Akademiya nauk Kazahskoj SSR, 1979.

The impact of the concession is mixed. During the first years almost 3,000 employees were laid off and water bills increased four-fold. There were improvements in service quality and efficiency, but most of the improvements occurred before privatization and improvements in service quality since privatization are not well documented. Privatization placed the burden of financing the renewal of the infrastructure directly on water consumers rather than on taxpayers. The private water utility owned by Veolia, Apa Nova Bucure≈üti (Bucharest New Water), is considered one of the most profitable Romanian utilities. ==Situation before privatization== View of Bucharest and the D√¢mbovi»õa River. Various reports paint contrasting pictures of the situation before privatization. A publicly available internal technical report by the World Bank before privatization and a World Bank publication written for public dissemination after privatization differ in their assessment of when improvements occurred. According to the paper for the wider public, before privatization \\"water supply was intermittent, pressure was low, quality fell short of standards, and there were outbreaks of waterborne disease.\\" According to the internal report, performance improved substantially between 1996 and 1999 before privatization under public management. Reported pressure problems decreased by 30 percent, complaints decreased by 20 percent, billing efficiency (the share of bills collected of the bills issued) increased from 80 to 92 percent, the share of metered residential connections increased from 50 to 91 percent, water availability increased from 12 hours to close to 24 hours per day, specific energy consumption decreased by 25 percent, and water losses - or more precisely non-revenue water - decreased from 45 to 35 percent, all before the privatization. The World Bank had supported the public utility through a US$25 million loan and evaluated the outcome of its project as satisfactory. World Bank:Implementation Completion Report:Bucharest Water Supply Project, 24 June 2002, p. 4-5, retrieved on May 15, 2012 However, according to some estimates the system still needed more than US$1 billion in investment. Neither the municipality nor the national government was able to finance an investment of this size.World Bank:Water in Bucharest:A Utility's Efficiency Gains under a Concession, February 2011, Viewpoint Note No. 326, by David Earhardt, Melissa Rekas and Martina Tonizz, retrieved on May 14, 2012 ==Prelude to privatization== In August 1997 the municipal government decided to bring the city's water system under some form of private management and approached the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, for advice. International Finance Corporation:Romania: Bucharest Water and Sanitation (RGAB), Infrastructure Advisory Success Stories, December 2008 A permanent sale of assets was ruled out by the government. Instead various forms of public-private partnerships were considered, ranging from a short-term lease or management contract with little or no private investment to a long-term concession under which the private operator was to finance all capital investments. Under all options the ownership of the infrastructure was to remain with the municipality. The IFC was paid through a relatively small retainer fee and a success fee. The latter provided an incentive in favor of the concession model. It was to be highest, at US$2.5 million, if the privatization was in the form of a concession, lower if it was in the form of a lease contract, and lowest for management contract. The IFC advised in favor of a concession contract, which was accepted by the municipality. At the time it was also considered whether the service area should be split in two halves, with two contracts to be awarded to separate companies each serving one part of the city. This arrangement had earlier been applied in Paris and in Manila, in order to allow to compare the performance of the operators (benchmarking). In Bucharest the city opted for retaining a single service area. The city also decided that it would retain shares in the new company. It contributed its share through the transfer of its fixed assets. The municipal share in the company is variously quoted as 20 percent or 14 percent, compared to a level of 31 percent that had apparently been envisaged initially. Emil Bojin:Water Supply in Bucharest. The Consumer's View, Association for the Protection of Consumers, Romania, Watertime Project Steering Committee, London, 11 April 2003, retrieved on May 15, 2012 The decision to privatize was taken by the municipal council with a majority of 51 from 60 votes. In parallel, a public relations campaign was carried out in the media, based on analysis from surveys and focus group discussions, in order to win support for the privatization. ==Tender and contract award== The selection of the private operator was carried out by the municipality, not by the national government. Only a single criterion was used to select the winning bidder among six short- listed companies: the lowest average water tariff over the 25-year concession contract. Three bids were received from Veolia (France), Suez Environnement (France) and International Water (UK). The bids were opened and evaluated on the same day in a public meeting in the presence of the media, allowing for a high level of transparency. The tender was won by Veolia which submitted an average tariff of only US$0.17 per cubic meter, with tariffs until year 16 discounted to their present value. This compared to an initial tariff of $0.18 per cubic meter. The water tariff submitted by Veolia was very low compared to other European countries. For example, the water and sewer tariff was seven times lower than in Athens ($1.34 per cubic meter) and more than 20 times lower than in Germany ($3.95 per cubic meter). In March 2000 the concession contract was signed between the municipality and the Veolia subsidiary Apa Nova Bucure≈üti. ==Financing== Apa Nova received concessionary financing from multilateral and bilateral development banks, including two loans for the new Crivina water treatment plant from the EBRD (EUR 55.4 m) and the German DEG (EUR 18.5m).European Bank for Reconstruction and Development:EBRD and DEG help improve water services in Bucharest, 19 December 2002 Veolia also provided EUR 35 million in equity. The bulk of the US$340 million investments in the 2000‚Äì2007 period were, however, financed through commercial loans and, indirectly, by customers through the company's retained earnings. ==Regulation and profitability== Tariff adjustments compared to what was stipulated in the bid were possible only after the fifth year of the concession. They need approval from the National Regulation Authority for the Public Utilities Community Services, ANRSC. In addition, the contract foresaw the possibility to increase tariffs beyond the contractually foreseen increases, if total water use was more than five percent below water use in the previous year. This stipulation was included to reduce the risk of low water demand. This was considered a substantial risk given the unusually high water production of 800 liter per capita per day - more than six times the level in Germany - at the beginning of the concession. Apa Nova:The concession contract, retrieved on May 14, 2012 The contract includes detailed standards for service quality and hefty fines for non-compliance. A performance bond had to be submitted which the municipality could draw if the company failed to pay the fines. Compliance with the 24 service quality indicators specified in the concession contract is controlled by AMRSP, the Municipal Authority for Public Services Regulation. In 2007 Apa Nova Bucharest was considered one of the most profitable Romanian utilities, working with a 24 percent net margin. In 2006 it doubled its net profits to EUR 24 million compared to 2005. SEEUROPE.NET:ROMANIA: Apa Nova Invested EUR 55 mln in Crivina Plant, 2 August 2007, retrieved on May 14, 2012 In 2010 the net profit was almost Lei 70 million (EUR 22 million), corresponding to a net profit margin of 17 percent. Doingbusiness.ro:Apa Nova Bucuresti Profit and Loss , retrieved on May 14, 2012 ==Results== The results of the concession after the first eight years were mixed. According to a World Bank paper for wide dissemination that did not quote supporting figures, \\"water quality improved, supply became continuous and water losses were halved\\" since privatization in 2000. Actually water supply was already continuous at the beginning of the concession, according to a technical report by the World Bank itself. Also, water losses had already been reduced significantly before the concession had been awarded, according to the same report. While the positive impacts are not well documented, the combined water and wastewater tariff increased six-fold from US$0.18 in 2000 to $1.08 per cubic meter in 2009. The average residential water and sewer bill increased still four-fold, slightly attenuated by a decline in water consumption. The monthly bill increased from 8 Lei ($3.5) in 2000 to 32 Lei ($14) in 2008. Veolia invested $349 million between 2000 and 2008. The government did not have to provide any subsidies, thus relieving the state budget accordingly. There were massive layoffs from the overstaffed utility during the first three years. Initially the private concessionaire planned to lay off 3,000 of its 4,900 employees. In May 2001, Traian BƒÉsescu, who had become mayor of Bucharest in June 2000, accused Apa Nova of breaching the concession agreement by laying off staff too quickly. While reaffirming his support for privatization he asked that the layoffs should be spread over a longer period in order to allow the city council to absorb the workers. Still fixated with privatisation: A Critical Review of the World Bank‚Äôs Water Resources Sector Strategy, by David Hall, Kate Bayliss and Emanuele Lobina, PSIRU, University of Greenwich, 2001, p. 8, retrieved on May 14, 2012 Ultimately, the number of employees was reduced to 1,977 in 2007. In 2003 the Association of Consumer Protection accused Apa Nova of overbilling, bot being responsive to customer complaints, not investing any funds of its own, and charging customers for the installation of meters although it was the company's obligation to pay for them. Furthermore, the Competition Inspectorate fined Apa Nova because it increased some tariffs without permission and Ioan Radu, the head of the National Regulation Authority for the Public Utilities Community Services, said that \\"this situation is the best example of how not to privatize a public service\\". However, according to Apa Nova there were improvements in efficiency. For example, the quantity of raw water purchased decreased by 50% between 2002 and 2011 as a result of reduced losses and reduced final consumption. Furthermore, total electric power consumption decreased by 70% between 2000 and 2011, both because of reduced water production and improved efficiency. Apa Nova:Environmental Protection , retrieved on May 14, 2012 These efficiency gains allowed the company to finance a higher level of investments from its own resources and they made the company more profitable. In 2007 the company sold 10 percent of the shares to its employees, a measure that had been delayed by several years. ==Addition of wastewater treatment== Wastewater in Bucharest is collected together with stormwater in a unitary sewer system. The resulting combined flow was discharged largely untreated into the river downstream of Bucharest until the completion of the Glina wastewater treatment plant in 2011. The plant has been financed by a grant of the EU, loans from the EIB and the EBRD, as well as government funds. The loans were made out to the municipality of Bucharest with a guarantee from the national government. The plant is operated by the private concessionaire Apa Nova since its completion. Apa Nova also took over the operation of the main trunk sewer of the city from the municipality in 2011. The sewer, which runs under the Dambovita river that crosses the city, is heavily deteriorated.

Two years later during the summer of 4 June 1987 at the City Stadium in Skopje there was a derby match of the Yugoslav league at that time between Vardar Skopje and Red Star Belgrade (3:1). On 'Zapad' for the first time since existence of the club a banner with the writing 'KOMITI' was noticed. The idea contained the establishment of a massive and strong Macedonian ultra scene. The goal was for 'KOMITI' to make the prominent post of all activities and events on the West Stand. As the most acceptable name of the group was selected 'KOMITI'.The history of Komiti (Vardar Skopje) The reason for it was simple: When the Balkans were in the Middle Ages under occupation by the Ottomans, young Macedonians under the name 'KOMITI' had organized themselves, in order to fight against the tyranny. This name is very strong and the meaning of the name is closely linked with their goals, this is why they decided not to use one like the standard unimaginative names such as Brigate, Commando, Ultras, Boys etc. And so, the name 'KOMITI' was selected for the new born Ultra group. 'KOMITI' also have subgroups, some of them are: 'Red Black Drinkers', 'Skinheads' who call themselves 'OI Warriors' and 'Metal Force'. Until 1999, 'Combat 87' was also a strong and dominating subgroup of 'Komiti', however they existed by the separation of some members. Not to forget is also the 'Golden Lords', a subgroup from the Karpo≈° part of Skopje, on 11 November 1997 they were formed. The number of members is at 200, on derby up to 700. The older generation of Komiti, the so- called 'Stara Garda' (old guard), sits today on 'Jug' (South Stand) and counts up to 30 men, with up to 50 for important matches. There is no city in Macedonia or ex-Yugoslavia, which 'KOMITI' have not visited. The largest away travel was in the year 1992 with about 900 supporters in Bitola for the league match between Pelister Bitola and Vardar Skopje. Also 'KOMITI' have made numerous away trips in Europe, like Bordeaux, Halmstad, Brussels, Valencia, Vienna, Bucharest, Kiev, Southampton, Rome and Gent. Not to forget is the away game on 3 September 2000 in Bratislava at the international match between Slovakia and Macedonia. Worth mentioning is that, one week before the match, in the Slovakian media it was reported that one of the largest and strongest Ultra groups would come from the Balkans to the match. The Slovakian police was also already informed, about what happened two weeks before in the city derby between Vardar and Sloga Jugomagnat in the Macedonian league and therefore sent a special-police force into the stadium. During the second minute of the game started the inevitable argument with the cops, what followed was a scene of police brutality.Slovak police brutality vs KOMITI SKOPJE The last big away travel in Europe was on 17 July 2004 during the Intertoto Cup match between Schalke 04 and Vardar Skopje. 'KOMITI' also have active members outside of Macedonia, in places like Australia, America, Sweden and Germany (Frankfurt, Duesseldorf, Bremen or Nuremberg). These help them particularly with away games of FK Vardar or the Macedonian national team. On 27 April 2002 'Komiti' celebrated their 15-years of existence, also on that date it was the anniversary of the golden generation of FK Vardar in 1987 with players such as Darko Pancev, Ilija Najdoski, Vasil Ringov, Boban Babunski, Dragan Kanatlarovski and many more, which won the championship in the Yugoslav league. The spectacle at the 'Gradski' stadium in Skopje attracted about 30,000 spectators. At the beginning of the second half and at the end of the game, 'Komiti' made the traditional pyro show with smoke bombs, flares and Bengal fires. Five years later, they celebrated their 20th anniversary at a friendly match between Vardar and Partizan with another impressive pyro show.20 years Komiti Zapad 'KOMITI' have no friends in the Macedonian scene, because their slogan is: ‚ÄúAlone against all‚Äù. Except for the good relationship with 'Vojvodi' from Tetovo, the relationships with the other groups is not so good. There are the most frequent arguments with the groups of the so-called 'Sverceri' (smugglers) of the city rival Sloga Jugomagnat, with 'Majmuni' from Pobeda Prilep and especially their biggest rivals ƒåkembari from Pelister Bitola. It is interesting that they were in alliance with Lozari from Kavadarci who are then left the 'Komiti' and teamed up with the Komiti's biggest rivals ƒåkembari. Today 'Komiti' have an executive committee including associated president and firm task dispatching (fan articles, flags, photo, actions, finances, general administration and internet). They help them self to a large extent, by selling fan articles and investing the money into new actions. The future of 'KOMITI' depends above all on the fact whether they succeed to integrate more young members into the hard core and find future guidance people. In order to realize their goal, they need better results from the club, both in the domestic league and in European Cups, so they can bring back the glory days of the 1980s and early 1990s. Despite prohibitions, obstructions, repression and negative propaganda from the media and police given to the name Komiti, they have always stayed strong and supported their club and country. *Brother groups: Vojvodi (Tetovo) and Ultras Gelsenkirchen (Gelsenkirchen) Interview with Komiti Zapad (Vardar Skopje, Macedonia)–ß–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–æ —à–∞–º–ø–∏–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —Ç–∏—Ç—É–ª–∞ –§–ö –í–ê–†–î–ê–†! ==References *Official website * *MakTifo Category:Ultras groups Category:FK Vardar ","title":"Komiti Skopje"},{"id":"35833427","text":"The following are the national records in athletics in Cura√ßao maintained by its national athletics federation: Cura√ßaose Atletiek Bond (CAB). ==OutdoorMen=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; width: 95%;\\" - !Event !Record !Athlete !Date !Meet !Place !Ref - 100 m 10.63 Hensley Paulina 16 March 2012 AYC Dutch Caribbean Invitational  Oranjestad, Aruba  - 200 m 20.82 Liemarvin Bonevacia 29 April 2012 Grand Prix International Ximena  Medell√≠n, Colombia  - 300 m 32.98 Liemarvin Bonevacia 5 July 2012 Meeting de la Province de Li√®ge  Li√®ge, Belgium  - 400 m 45.60 Liemarvin Bonevacia 4 August 2012 Olympic Games  London, United Kingdom  - 800 m 1:55.50 Jairo Troeman 11 March 2011 Carifta Trials 2011  Curacao  - 1500 m 4:13.06 Jairo Troeman 13 May 2011 World Athletics Day  Curacao  - 3000 m 10:31.59 Agiomar Nar 11 March 2011 Carifta Trials 2011  Curacao  - 5000 m 17:56.34 Virgilio Isenia 9 April 2011 Pre- Carifta Games Competition 2011  Curacao  - 10000 m 39:16.00 Virgilio Isenia 30 April 2010 Aruba Boulevard Loop  Aruba  - Marathon       - 110 m hurdles       - 400 m hurdles       - 3000 m steeplechase       - High jump 2.00 m Quentin Siberi 23 April 2011 CARIFTA Games  Montego Bay, Jamaica  - Pole vault 4.65 m Glenn Kunst 16 April 2017 CARIFTA Games  Willemstad, Cura√ßao  - Long jump 6.87 m Quentin Siberi 11 June 2011 Pre-Curacao Championships 2011  Curacao  - Triple jump 14.30 m Rigsheillo Rosalia 24 June 2011 Curacao Championships 2011  Curacao  - Shot put 10.79 m John-Henk Maduro 11 March 2011 Carifta Trials 2011  Curacao  - Discus throw 34.96 m Gionne Martes 8 April 2011 Pre-Carifta Games Competition 2011  Curacao  - Hammer throw       - Javelin throw       - rowspan=2Decathlon       - colspan=5  - 20 km walk (road)       - 50 km walk (road)       - 4√ó100 m relay 41.49  Nygell Dumfries Liemarvin Bonevacia Hensley Paulina Rachmil Van Lamoen 16 July 2011 Central American and Caribbean Championships  Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico  - 4√ó400 m relay       } ===Women=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; width: 95%;\\" - !Event !Record !Athlete !Date !Meet !Place !Ref - 100 m       - 200 m 24.04 (+0.9 m/s) Emmy Franenk 3 May 2012 MEAC Championships  Greensboro, United States  - 400 m 53.84 Emmy Franenk 4 May 2012 MEAC Championships  Greensboro, United States  - 800 m       - 1500 m       - 3000 m       - 5000 m       - 10000 m       - Marathon       - 100 m hurdles       - 400 m hurdles       - 3000 m steeplechase       - High jump 1.70 m Sharyaane Gijsbertha 1 April 2013 CARIFTA Games  Nassau, Bahamas  - Pole vault       - Long jump       - Triple jump       - Shot put       - Discus throw       - Hammer throw       - Javelin throw       - rowspan=2Heptathlon       - colspan=5 (100 m hurdles), (high jump), (shot put), (200 m) / (long jump), (javelin), (800 m)  - 20 km walk (road)       - 4x100 m relay       - 4x400 m relay       } ==IndoorMen=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; width: 95%;\\" - !Event !Record !Athlete !Date !Meet !Place !Ref - 60 m       - 200 m       - 400 m       - 800 m       - 1500 m       - 3000 m       - 60 m hurdles       - High jump       - Pole vault       - Long jump       - Triple jump       - Shot put       - rowspan=2Heptathlon       - colspan=5 (60 m), (long jump), (shot put), (high jump) / (60 m hurdles), (pole vault), (1000 m)  - 5000 m walk       - 4x400 m relay       } ===Women=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; width: 95%;\\" - !Event !Record !Athlete !Date !Meet !Place !Ref - 60 m 7.82 Emmy Franenk 28 January 2012 Penn State National Invitational  University Park, United States  - 200 m       - 400 m       - 800 m       - 1500 m       - 3000 m       - 60 m hurdles       - High jump       - Pole vault       - Long jump       - Triple jump       - Shot put       - rowspan=2Pentathlon       - colspan=5 (60 m hurdles), (high jump), (shot put), (long jump), (800 m)  - 3000 m walk       - 4x400 m relay       } ==References Curacao Records Records in athletics ","title":"List of Cura√ßaoan records in athletics"},{"id":"35833442","text":"Alberto Eugenio Mestre Sosa (born September 30, 1964) is a former competition swimmer who represented Venezuela at the 1980 Summer Olympics and 1984 Summer Olympics.

He was the first of the two Qi rulers called Duke Zhuang. ==Reign== Duke Zhuang succeeded his father Duke Cheng of Qi, who died in 795 BC, as ruler of Qi. He had a long reign during an era of upheaval in China. In 771 BC, the Quanrong tribes from the west attacked Haojing, capital of the Zhou Dynasty, and killed King You of Zhou. Duke Xiang of the state of Qin sent his army to escort King You's son King Ping of Zhou to the new capital Luoyi, marking the beginning of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. As a reward for Qin's protection King Ping formally granted Duke Xiang of Qin a nobility rank and elevated Qin to the status of a vassal state on par with other major states such as Qi and Jin. Although Qi was little affected by the turmoil as it was located east of the Zhou territory, the state of Qin would from then on grow stronger and eventually conquer Qi in 221 BC and unite China under the Qin Dynasty.

They were used as main guns on the most typical frigates of the early 19th century, on the second deck of third-rate ships of the line, and even on the third deck of late first-rate ships of the line. == Usage == As the 18-pounder calibre was consistent with both the French and the British calibre systems, it was used in many European navies between the 17th and the 19th century. It was a heavy calibre for early ships of the line, arming, for instance, the main batteries of Couronne in 1636. From the late 18th century, the French Navy used the 18-pounder in three capacities: as the main gun on frigates, as the battery on the upper gundeck of two-deckers, and lastly on the top deck of three-deckers. French frigates began carrying the 18-pounder under Louis XV, when the two Pourvoyeuse class frigates, originally designed to carry 24-pounders, were equipped with it; at the time, a typical frigate would carry 12-pounders. Under Louis XVI, from 1779, the 18-pounder gradually became the standard calibre for frigates, starting with the H√©b√© Class. These frigates were built on standard patterns designed by Jacques-No√´l San√©, carrying 26, and later 28 main guns, complemented with smaller pieces on the forecastle. Around 130 of these frigates were built. At the end of the Empire, 24-pounder frigates began supplanting the 18-pounder frigates. Frigates built after the Bourbon Restoration used a different artillery system, one involving 30-pounders. On two-deckers, the 18-pounder was mounted on the upper deck as secondary artillery, to complement the 36-pounder main artillery on the lower deck. A 74-gun would carry thirty 18-pounders; this lighter secondary battery added firepower to the ship without raising the centre of gravity too much. In rough weather, vessels often could not use their main battery lest water enter through the gun-ports, and the secondary battery then became the vessel's main armament; for example, the Droits de l'Homme was effectively reduced to the firepower of a frigate when she fought the action of 13 January 1797 in stormy weather, leading to her destruction at the hand of two British frigates that would normally not have been a match for her; in the opposite case, during the Glorious First of June, Vengeur du Peuple used her main batteries but became unmanageable and sank after taking in water from her lower gun-ports, whose covers had been ripped off in a collision with HMS Brunswick. Reenactors dressed in American uniforms \\"load\\" an 18-pounder cannon at Yorktown National Park, USA. Three-deckers used 36-pounders on their lower decks and 24-pounders on their second deck. Until 1803, the third deck was equipped with 12-pounder guns, as a heavier gun would have destabilised the ship; after this date, however, San√© introduced design improvements that allowed installation of 18-pounders on the third deck of Imp√©rial; later 120-gun ships of the line used the same arrangement; these ships carried thirty-four 18-pounders. During the First French Empire, 18-pounders would also arm Type 1 Model Towers for coastal defence. After introduction of rifled artillery in the middle 19th century, long 18-pounders were converted into so-called \\"14 cm n¬∞ 1 rifled muzzle-loaders Model 1864\\", by etching grooves on the inside of the barrel. The Royal Navy used the 18-pounder on frigates, which carried 28 guns. Fourth rates ships carried 26 on their secondary batteries, and third rates carried 28. Unlike the French, the British used second rates, of 90 to 98 guns; the 90-gun vessels carried thirty 18-pounders on their middle deck, while the 98-gun vessels carried a total of sixty 18-pounders, distributed over both the second and the third deck. First rates carried thirty-four 18-pounders on their third deck and 24-pounders on the middle deck. In his discussion of the single-ship action in which the French frigate Pi√©montaise captured the East Indiaman Warren Hastings on 11 June 1805, the naval historian William James compared the 18-pounder medium guns on Warren Hastings with the 18-pounder long guns that the British Royal Navy used. The medium 18-pounder was long, and weighed 26 Cwt (); the Royal Navy's long 18-pounder was long and weighed 42 Cwt ().James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.239-44. == Citations and references == ;Citations ;References * ==External links== * Jean Boudriot et Hubert Berti, L'Artillerie de mer : marine fran√ßaise 1650-1850, Paris, √©ditions Ancre, 1992 () (notice BNF no FRBNF355550752). * Jean Peter, L'artillerie et les fonderies de la marine sous Louis XIV, Paris, Economica, 1995, 213 p.

Dust & Construction activities are mostly in the urban areas while Waste Burning is in the rural areas (agriculture). Air pollution in India is a serious health issue. Of the most polluted cities in the world, 21 out of 30 were in India in 2019. As per a study based on 2016 data, at least 140 million people in India breathe air that is 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit and 13 of the world's 20 cities with the highest annual levels of air pollution are in India. The 51% of pollution is caused by the industrial pollution, 27 % by vehicles, 17% by crop burning and 5% by diwali fireworks.Want govt to build 1600 km green wall along Aravalli, Indian Express, 24 December 2019. Air pollution contributes to the premature deaths of 2 million Indians every year. Emissions come from vehicles and industry, whereas in rural areas, much of the pollution stems from biomass burning for cooking and keeping warm. In autumn and winter months, large scale crop residue burning in agriculture fields ‚Äì a cheaper alternative to mechanical tilling ‚Äì is a major source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution.Badarinath, K.

A 2013 study on non-smokers has found that have 30% weaker lung function than Europeans. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 to regulate air pollution but has failed to reduce pollution because of poor enforcement of the rules. In 2015, Government of India, together with IIT Kanpur launched the National Air Quality Index. In 2019, India launched 'The National Clean Air Programme' with tentative national target of 20%-30% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024, considering 2017 as the base year for comparison. It will be rolled out in 102 cities that are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. There are other initiatives such as a 1,600-kilometre-long and 5-kilometre-wide The Great Green Wall of Aravalli green ecological corridor along Aravalli range from Gujarat to Delhi which will also connect to Shivalik hill range with planting of 1.35 billion (135 crore) new native trees over 10 years to combat the pollution. In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St. Louis, launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in India. == Causes == Cooking fuel in rural India is prepared from a wet mix of dried grass, fuelwood pieces, hay, leaves and mostly cow/livestock dung. This mix is patted down into disc-shaped cakes, dried, and then used as fuel in stoves. When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 times higher than coal. === Fuel and biomass burning === A rural aburo stove using biomass cakes, fuelwood and trash as cooking fuel. Surveys suggest over 100 million households in India use such stoves (chullahs) every day, 2‚Äì3 times a day. Clean burning fuels and electricity are unavailable in rural parts and small towns of India because of poor rural highways and limited energy generation infrastructure. Fuel wood and biomass burning is the primary reason for near-permanent haze and smoke observed above rural and urban India, and in satellite pictures of the country. Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in cook stoves known as chullah or chulha piece in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of challahs. Air pollution is also the main cause of the Asian brown cloud, which is delaying the start of the monsoon. The Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop until electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India. India is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuel-wood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agricultural waste and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent. The overall contribution of fuelwood, including sawdust and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total. India burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States; the fuelwood quality in India is different from the dry firewood of the United States; and, the Indian stoves in use are less efficient, thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent. ===Fuel adulteration=== Some Indian taxis and auto-rickshaws run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India. Some adulterants increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax. As fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper hydrocarbon into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20‚Äì30 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee. Adulterated fuel increases tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions ‚Äî which fall into the category of unregulated emissions ‚Äî of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well-known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline, its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and PM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue. ===Traffic congestion=== Traffic congestion is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused by several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometre of available roads, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos due to poor enforcement of traffic laws. Traffic congestion reduces the average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal that vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. An average trip speeds between 20 and 40 kilometres per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometres per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 and 20 kilometres per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometres per hour. Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion. Traffic gridlock in Delhi and other Indian cities is extreme. The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometres per hour; a 10-kilometre trip can take 30 minutes, or more. At such speeds, vehicles in India emit air pollutants 4 to 8 times more than they would with less traffic congestion; Indian vehicles also consume a lot more carbon footprint fuel per trip, than they would if the traffic congestion was less. Emissions of particles and heavy metals increase over time because the growth of the fleet and mileage outpaces the efforts to curb emissions. In cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma. === Greenhouse gas emissions === Market for Air Pollution: The box represents the current status quo and the star represents the ideal, socially optimal point to be at. The shaded area represents the dead weight loss.The MAC curve denotes the additional cost of achieving one more unit decrease in level of emissions. MD denotes the additional damage caused by an additional unit of emission. India was the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2017 at 6.82% share of CO2 emissions, after China (27.21%) and the United States (14.58%). According to a report by the Global Carbon Project, \\"‚Äúafter low growth during 2014 to 2016, fossil CO2 emissions have now risen two years in a row, with a 1.6 per cent rise in 2017 and a projected 2.7 per cent (range 1.8 per cent to 3.7 per cent) rise expected in 2018, reaching a record high of 37.1 (plus or minus 2) billion tonnes of CO2. The peak in global CO2 emissions is not yet in sight.‚Äù About 65 percent of India's carbon dioxide emissions in 2009 was from heating, domestic uses and power sector. About 9 percent of India's emissions were from transportation (cars, trains, two wheelers, aeroplanes, others). India's coal- fired, oil-fired and natural gas-fired thermal power plants are inefficient and offer significant potential for CO2 emission reduction through better technology. Compared to the average emissions from coal-fired, oil-fired and natural gas-fired thermal power plants in European Union (EU-27) countries, India's thermal power plants emit 50 to 120 percent more CO2 per kWh produced. This is in significant part to inefficient thermal power plants installed in India prior to its economic liberalisation in the 1990s. == Effects  Health costs of air pollution === Asthma is the leading health problem faced by Indians. Not surprisingly, it accounts for more than 50% of the health problems caused by air pollution. The most important reason for concern over the worsening air pollution in the country is its effect on the health of individuals. Exposure to particulate matter for a long time can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, COPD, lung cancer and heart attack. The Global Burden of Disease Study for 2010, published in 2013, had found that outdoor air pollution was the fifth-largest killer in India and around 620,000 early deaths occurred from air pollution- related diseases in 2010. According to a WHO study, 13 of the 20 most-polluted cities in the world are in India; however, the accuracy and methodology of the WHO study was questioned by the Government of India. India also has one of the highest number of COPD patients and the highest number of deaths due to COPD. Over a million Indians die prematurely every year due to air pollution, according to the non-profit Health Effects Institute. Over two million children‚Äîhalf the children in Delhi‚Äîhave abnormalities in their lung function, according to the Delhi Heart and Lung Institute. Over the past decade air pollution has increased in India significantly. Asthma is the most common health problem faced by Indians and it accounts for more than half of the health issues caused by air pollution. The Global Burden of Disease Study of 2017 analysed in a report by The Lancet indicated that 76.8% of Indians are exposed to higher ambient particulate matter over 40 Œºg/m¬≥, which is significantly above the national limit recommenced by national guidelines on ambient air pollution. The study estimated that of 480.7 million Disability- Adjusted Life Years in India 4.4% of could be ascribed to ambient particulate matter pollution and 15.8 million of them were the result of polluted air in households. In terms of average life expectancy it is suggested that average life expectancy in India would increase by 1.7 years if exposure was limited to national minimum recommendations. Ambient air pollution in India is estimated to cause 670,00 deaths annually and particularly aggravates respiratory and cardiovascular conditions including chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and asthma. Ambient air pollution is linked to an increase in hospital visits, with a higher concentration of outdoor pollution particulates resulting in emergency room visit increases of between 20-25% for a range of conditions associated with higher exposure to air pollution.Approximately 76% of households in rural India are reliant on solid biomass for cooking purposes which contributes further to the disease burden of ambient air pollution experienced by the population of India. === State-Wide Trends === According to the WHO, India has14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentrations. Other Indian cities that registered very high levels of PM2.5 pollutants are Delhi, Patna, Agra, Muzzaffarpur, Srinagar, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Patiala and Jodhpur, followed by Ali Subah Al-Salem in Kuwait and a few cities in China and Mongolia. Air Quality Index (AQI) is a number used to communicate the level of pollution in the air and it essentially tells you the level of pollution in the air in a given city on a given day. The AQI of Delhi was placed under the \\"severe-plus category\\" when it touched 574, by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research. In May 2014 the World Health Organization announced New Delhi as the most polluted city in the world. In November 2016, the Great smog of Delhi was an environmental event which saw New Delhi and adjoining areas in a dense blanket of smog, which was the worst in 17 years. 2018 Air Pollution in New Delhi (PM2.5 AQI). A surge on June 14 was caused by dust storms brought on by a combination of extreme heat and powerful downdraft winds. {  +Top 20 Cities in India with the highest level of PM 2.5 !Cities !PM2.5 Levels - Delhi 153 - Patna 149 - Gwalior 144 - Raipur 134 - Ahmedabad 100 - Lukhnow 96 - Firozabad 96 - Kanpur 93 - Amritsar 92 - Ludhiana 91 - Allahbad 88 - Agra 88 - Khanna 88 } India's Central Pollution Control Board now routinely monitors four air pollutants namely sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (PM10). These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year. The key findings of India's central pollution control board are: *Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non- attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by the government. *A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhopal during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of CNG instead of diesel in certain vehicles. *A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood. *Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources. *The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. In other words, India's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of monsoon season. *The average annual SOx and NOx emissions level and periodic violations in industrial areas of India were significantly and surprisingly lower than the emission and violations in residential areas of India *Of the four major Indian cities, air pollution was consistently worse in Delhi, every year over 5-year period (2004‚Äì2018). Kolkata was a close second, followed by Mumbai. Chennai air pollution was least of the four. == Steps Taken == * The government in Delhi launched an Odd-Even Rule in November, 2017 which is based on the Odd-Even rationing method: This meant that cars running with number plates ending in Odd digits could only be driven on certain days of the week, while the Even digit cars could be driven on the remaining days of the week. * Local governments of various states also implemented measures such as tighter vehicle emissions‚Äô norms, higher penalties for burning rubbish and better control of road dust. * The Indian government has committed to a 50% reduction in households using solid fuel for cooking *Some goals set for future are: **Clean up the transportation sector by introducing 1,000 electric public transport buses to its 5,50-string feet **Upgrade all fossil fuel combustion engined vehicles to BS6 emission standards ** Meet a goal of 25% of private vehicles to be electricity powered by 2023 ** Renewable energy in all power plants ** Provide farmers with a machine called a Happy Seeder which converts agricultural residue to fertilizer ** Analyze health data and study the efficiency of different room filtration systems in areas where indoor air pollution is highest. ** Identify effective ways to inform the public about air pollution data ** Launch new citizen science programs to better document exposures **Reduce Carbon Emissions: \\"According to Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, to limit warming well below 2 degree Celsius, CO2 emissions should decline by about 20 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero around 2075; to limit warming below 1.5 degree Celsius, CO2 emissions should decline by 50 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by around 2050‚Ä¶\\" ==See also== * Air pollution in Delhi * List of Kerala cities by ambient air quality * Hydrogen internal combustion engine auto rickshaw * BioDME: low-pollution fuel for diesel generators * Steam reforming of natural gas with methane pyrolysis: CO2-neutral hydrogen production from natural gas * Petroleum coke * List of most-polluted cities * Criteria air pollutants ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * == External links == Category:Pollution in India ","title":"Air pollution in India"},{"id":"35833555","text":"Chatsworth is a three-part British television documentary series first aired on BBC One in 2012. It documents, over 2011, contemporary life at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, England which, as the family seat of the Duke of Devonshire, employs 700 staff to look after the 300 rooms of the house, plus a 35,000-acre estate, embracing 62 farms and three villages.BBC official page ==Episode one== The first programme joins the 12th duke and duchess as the house is being prepared to open to the public on Sunday 13 March 2011.

The route, located in El Paso County on the west side of the city of El Paso, links U.S. Highway 85 (US 85) across Interstate 10 (I-10) to the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). The spur's numerical designation commemorates the championship won by UTEP, then known as Texas Western College, in the 1966 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. ==Route description== The spur begins at US 85 (Paisano Drive) and proceeds to the northeast over a bridge crossing I-10 before ending at Schuster Avenue. The route replaced the nearby Yandell Drive overpass across I-10, which was demolished. The route is intended to provide better access between UTEP and nearby medical facilities, provide an additional route along US 85 between the campus and downtown El Paso, and allow improved access to businesses along State Highway 20 (SH 20, Mesa Street). The route is also designed to alleviate heavy traffic encroachment into nearby residential neighborhoods, and foster a more pedestrian-friendly environment for the UTEP campus. TxDOT planning for the spur includes accommodation, not only of vehicular traffic, but also bicycle and pedestrian traffic. ==History== Spur 1966 was originally designated on February 23, 2012 as Spur 73. To avoid conflict, this was changed to Spur 1966 on March 29, 2012. The project was expected to have cost between $50‚Äì60 million, and was opened to traffic in early 2015. The spur's unusual designation‚Äîit is the only four-digit state highway spur in Texas‚Äîwas chosen to honor the historic 1966 NCAA championship of the 1965‚Äì66 Texas Western Miners men's basketball team as UTEP and the UTEP Miners were previously known. The Miners made history by playing the NCAA basketball championships' first-ever entirely African-American starting lineup inspiring the film Glory Road. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==References *Spur 1966 Project from TxDOT Category:Transportation in El Paso County, Texas 1966 ","title":"Texas State Highway Spur 1966"},{"id":"35833635","text":"Ashk (, also Romanized as Ashg and Eshk; also known as Kaleh Ishq, Qal‚Äòeh Ishq, and Qal‚Äòeh-ye ‚ÄòEshq) is a village in Darmian Rural District, in the Central District of Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The individual stories in book were originally published in leading literary magazines such as Harper's Young People and St. Nicholas Magazine between 1887 and 1892. They were later collected and reprinted by Harper & Brothers in 1892. These stories primarily feature children who learn moral lessons after misbehaving. ==Stories\\"Young Lucretia\\"=== Young Lucretia Raymond lives with her strict Aunts Lucretia and Maria. During Christmastime, Lucretia is invited by the other schoolchildren to trim the Christmas tree at the schoolhouse in preparation for the Christmas celebrations. When she expresses her aunt's predicted disapproval and refusal to let her participate in the trimming, the other girls insult her aunts, calling them ‚Äúmean‚Äù and ‚Äústingy.‚Äù They also taunt Lucretia, saying she would not get anything on the Christmas tree; this scene caused Lucretia shame. She felt like she did not fit in with the other children and that her family was dishonored. In order to maintain her family honor and to fit in with the other children, Lucretia asks her aunts for presents, but they refuse her request, so Lucretia wrapped parcels for herself and left them at the schoolhouse while her aunts were out. During the distribution of presents at the Christmas celebration, Lucretia's name was called many times, to her aunts‚Äô amazement and Lucretia's remorse. When she finally opened the packages, the aunts saw that the parcel contents were objects from their house. One package however, contained a rag doll made by Mrs. Emmons, one of the neighboring women. When Lucretia saw this doll, she cried and expressed surprise that someone had given her a gift. On the way home, she confessed to her aunts that she wanted the other children to think that she had things. The aunts confiscated her rag doll, and sent her to bed before deciding they were being too harsh. The next day, on Christmas Day, the aunts bought Lucretia a big wax doll, bedstead, baby carriage and bureau. ===\\"How Fidelia Went to the Store\\"=== The story begins with Mrs. Lennox deliberating with her sister, Maria Crooker, on what to do about the fact that Mr. Lennox had forgotten to bring back the raisins necessary to bake the wedding cake of the Lennox's older daughter, Cynthy Lennox. Since Mr. Lennox and Cynthy were both out of town, and Mrs. Lennox and Aunt Maria where physically incapable of going to the store, the women decided to send Mrs. Lennox's six-year-old daughter, Fidelia, to Ms. Rose's store for raisins. After giving Fidelia instructions to knock on the side door of Ms. Rose's store, Mrs. Lennox gave Fidelia a penny for a peppermint as a treat, and sent her off with a cart to carry the raisins. When Fidelia failed to return home by the expected time, the women became nervous. Aunt Maria decided she would set out to look for Fidelia. Soon after, Mr. Lennox and Cynthy returned in the buggy. When they found out that Fidelia was lost, they set out in the buggy to search for her, picking up Aunt Maria midway. When the party reached Ms. Rose's store, they found Fidelia next to the store door. Fidelia cried and complained that she‚Äôd knocked and knocked, but that no one had answered her. When Mrs. Rose realized this, she exclaimed that she had been in the kitchen and hadn‚Äôt heard the knocks. At the end of the story, Fidelia was given cookies and milk from Mrs. Rose's. As the party was about to leave, Fidelia cried for her peppermint candy. Subsequently, she received an assortment of candies. ===\\"Ann Mary; Her Two Thanksgivings\\"=\\"Ann Lizy's Patchwork\\"=== Ann Lizy Jennings is orphaned and lives with her grandmother. One day she, put on her best dress and set out to visit her friend, Jane Baxter. Before Ann left, her grandmother gave her embroidered green silk bag to Ann to carry patchwork in. She also instructed Ann to be careful with the bag and her dress, and to finish four squares of patchwork at Jane's before playing. Ann realized that sewing four squares of patchwork and taking tea with Jane would leave her with less than enough time to play with Jane. About halfway to Jane's house, Ann used her handkerchief, and when she put it back into the bead bag containing her patchwork, she purposefully left the bag open and swung it by one string. When Ann arrived at Jane's house, the bag felt empty, but she ignored the emptiness and played with Jane. In the meantime, the parson's wife's sister, her husband, and her daughter Sally were traveling in the area. They picked up Ann Lizy's patchwork, which Sally decided to put it in her quilt. Eventually, Ann settled down to sew her patchwork and panicked because it was gone. Mrs. Baxter sent Ann and Jane to look for the patchwork, but along the way, Ann Lizy climbed a wall and ended up tearing her best dress. She also lost her grandmother's embroidered green bag. That night, after Ann returned home, her grandmother scolded her. Ann eased her conscience by confessing she had lost her patchwork on purpose. That week the parson's wife visited Mrs. Jennings, and Ann Lizy noticed that she was carrying grandmother's green embroidered bag. Later on, grandmother took her friend, Mrs. White, and Ann to visit the parsonage. Sally and her family happened to be visiting too. Sally was asked to show Ann Lizy her patchwork. To Ann's surprise, Sally's patchwork pieces were the ones Ann had lost. Mrs. White commented on the fact that the patchwork pattern matched one of grandmother's dresses. At the discovery, the parson's wife insisted that Mrs. Jennings take back the handkerchief and embroidered bag. Sally's mother also insisted that Ann take back the patchwork despite the fact that Sally had sewed it. In response, Ann confessed that she had lost the patchwork on purpose because she did not want to sew. On their way home, grandmother realizes Ann had learned her lesson. ===\\"The Little Persian Princess\\"=== The story was originally published in St. Nicholas Magazine. Dorothy came from the almshouse to work for Dame Betsey, spinning flax to make linen for the Dame's six daughters. Since Dorothy's only family member is an old grandmother at the almshouse, she lives off the table scraps of Dame Betsey and her daughters, but still willingly shares her food with the poor little boy next door. One day, a cat arrives and the Dame's daughters ask to keep the cat to spite their mother, who hates cats. That night, after all the daughters had gone to bed, Dorothy was sewing an apron for the Dame's eldest daughter when the cat transformed into a princess in Dorothy's sight. The Princess confessed her status as a Persian Princess traveling under the disguise of a cat in order to rescue her brother, who has been transformed into a Maltese cat. She then asked what Dorothy desired the most. Dorothy answered that she wished to provide a cushioned chair and a window for her grandmother. The princess asked Dorothy to follow her little ways away from the house, where they find the Princess‚Äô portmanteau disguised as a small wallet. From the portmanteau, the princess pulled out a robe for Dorothy to exchange for her freedom from the Dame. The next day Dorothy obtained her freedom and set out with the princess. They settled in a cottage and Dorothy made cushions from the Princess‚Äô inexhaustible dresses in the portmanteau. Eventually, Dorothy was able to support her grandmother, and the princess set off on her travels again. Awhile later, Dorothy went into the city to deliver cushions. At the house she was making the delivery to, she encounters the princess and her brother in the form of two cats. Dorothy learns that they are in the care of two older women, and the princess shares that her brother is under a spell that can only be broken if one of the women chases him out with a broom. However, the Princess states that this seems unlikely to happen because the ladies are quite kind to them. Before Dorothy and the princess parted, the princess wished her a happy life. Dorothy eventually marries the boy next door. ===\\"Where the Christmas- Tree Grew\\"=== This story originally appeared in St. Nicholas Magazine. Jenny Brown is a na√Øve girl who lives alone with her mother and is attending her first term of school. One day, during recess at school, some girls and Earl Munroe, the handsome son of the wealthiest man in town, trick Jenny Brown into believing the idea that Christmas presents are grown on Christmas trees. They told her that if she climbed the Franklin Mountain past her house, she could find the Christmas trees and Christmas presents. Jenny believed the other children headed towards the mountain after school. That night, Mrs. Brown ran to the Munroe's and reported that Jenny was lost. When Earl heard this, he sobbed and confessed that he had tricked Jenny into believing presents grew on trees. Mr. Munroe raised an alarm and organized a search party to look for Jenny. In the meantime, Earl decided to give away his Christmas tree and presents to Jenny, transporting them by sled. On the way to Jenny's house, he meets Maud, the Judge's daughter. Earl suggests that Maud give her things to Jenny too, and Maud overcomes her reluctance, contributing food and clothes. As Earl proceeded to the Brown's house with the gifts, more children joined the procession, bringing their gifts to Jenny. The next day, some searchers met an old woodcutter, who said that he had found Jenny crying on the mountain and had taken her home, but that the storm had prohibited him from letting the searchers know. When Jenny returned home, she was met with love and with presents. ===\\"Where Sarah Jane's Doll Went\\"=== Sarah Jane receives a new rag doll from her sister Serena, who warns Sarah not to take the rag doll to school. Sarah loves the doll so much that she is reluctant to separate from it during the school day, so she defies her sister's warning and takes the doll to school. At recess, Sarah displays her doll to many other admiring children. One of the older boys, Joe West, comes over, asking to hold the doll. Sarah is initially reluctant to let him hold the doll but she ultimately relents. When Joe gets the doll, he makes fun of Sarah and refuses to return the doll. Afterschool, Joe ignores Sarah's pleas for the doll. He takes it with him and runs home. On the way home, Sarah passes the Wests‚Äô fields and sees Joe teasing a calf. She calls out to Joe but he ignores her, heading towards the house. Sarah then sits by the roadside and cries as a remorseful Joe watches her through the window from his house. In actuality Joe had not been teasing the calf, Sarah had been watching Joe attempting to wrestle the doll from the mouth of the hungry calf who had caught hold of the doll in Joe's pocket. Three months later, there was a knock on Sarah Jane's door. A packet containing a china doll was left for her. Unknown to Sarah, Joe had worked for three months to buy the doll. This time Sarah obeyed her mother's instruction not to take the doll to school. Years later, Joe and Sarah laugh about the story. ===\\"Seventoes' Ghost\\"=== At the beginning of the story, Benjamin Wellman, who lives with his mother and his grandfather, brings back a puppy and asks to keep it as a pet. His domineering grandfather refuses to let the puppy stay because his own seven-toed cat, Seventoes is afraid of dogs. After Grandfathers‚Äô refusal, Benjamin takes the puppy to Sammy, who had previously mentioned that he would like to keep the dog if Benjamin's grandfather wouldn‚Äôt let him. Benjamin then started back for home, angry that he wasn‚Äôt allowed to keep the dog. When he arrived home, he saw Seventoes sitting on the ledge of the well. In his anger, he shoved Seventoes into the well. Benjamin watched Seventoes disappear under the water and was shocked when he realizes what he had done. Remorseful, he runs into the house and confesses to his grandfather and his mother that he had killed Seventoes. Grandfather sent mother to fish the cat out of the well, but before she could do it, Seventoes walked into the house, unhurt, because his extra toes had enabled him to climb up the well. Benjamin sobbed with relief and expresses his remorse. That night, he fed Seventoes and vowed that he would behave well in the future. ===\\"Little Mirandy, and How She Earned Her Shoes\\"=== Mirandy is the second youngest in a family of thirteen children. Due to the amount of children, clothing often ran out in the family. One Sunday, Mirandy cried because she had to attend the meetings without shoes. In response, her mother said that she could pick berries during berry season and earn her shoes herself. Towards the end of July, Mirandy set out to pick berries with her siblings. On the way to the pasture, Mirandy overheard her siblings conversing about the fact that Captain Moseby's land had the thickest berries, but that they were unobtainable since the Captain was not afraid to shoot or set his dog on anyone who tried to steal his berries. When they arrived at the pasture, Mirandy decides to venture to the Captain's lot. Bringing her younger brother, baby Jonathan, along because Mirandy was left in charge of him. Mirandy managed to fill her bucket in Captain Moseby's lot, and started back towards the rest of her siblings, but when she tried to get through the vines separating Captain Moseby's lot and the rest of the pasture, a vine scratched Jonathan's leg, and he started kicking and screaming. In order to take her brother back, Mirandy left her bucket. When she returned to Captain Moseby's lot, her bucket was gone, so she went back to her siblings and told them she had been picking berries at the Captain's lot and that she had lost her bucket there. The siblings decided that the Captain had taken the bucket, so they knocked on his door in attempt to retrieve the bucket. No one answered, and eventually, all of the siblings decided to leave except Mirandy, who was determined to stay until she got her bucket. At two, the Captain opened his door and told her that in order to retrieve her bucket, she had to settle with him in his house. She entered his house and he commanded her to eat the whole bowl of berries, which she suspiciously did. The captain then proceeded to ask why she stole his berries. She responded that she wanted to earn her shoes. He admonished her, mentioning soldiers having to go barefoot at Valley Forge. Eventually, he warns her not to steal his berries again, and then brings her a pair of shoes. ===\\"A Parsnip Stew\\"=== The story begins with Mrs. Whitman cooking dinner with her daughter Ruth. Mrs. Whitman is worried that the parsnip stew she is cooking would not be enough to feed her husband, children and brothers Caleb and Silas. When the stew was almost done, the Wigginses, Mrs. Whitmans‚Äô distant relatives, arrive at the door with their three children and old Mrs. Wiggins. Their arrival without warning angered Ruth, who knew that there was not enough stew. Ruth complained to her mother that she thought the Wigginses actions were rude. In response, mother entrusted Ruth to add salt to the stew. After adding the salt, Ruth left for school without taking any dinner. While at school, she reflected and was able to empathize with the Wigginses. After reflecting, she decided to show the Wigginses her hospitality when she went home. However, when Ruth arrived home, her sister met her at the door and recounted that Ruth had mistakenly added saleratus into the stew. Serena said that when the Wigginses tasted the stew, they accused the Whitmans of spoiling the stew on purpose: an assumption that resulted from the Whitmans‚Äô half-hearted welcome and the fact that none of the Whitmans had taken any stew. In order to salvage the situation, Ruth visited the Wigginses with a jar of their honey, apologizing and explaining the situation. She then invited them to have parsnip stew with them the next day. When Ruth returned home, Serena was distressed because most of their parsnips had rotted. She mentioned that the Wigginses had a good lot of parsnips, so Ruth decided to send over the neighbor's son to buy some parsnips from the Wigginses. The next day Mr. Wiggins arrived and apologized, saying he‚Äôd lent out their horse earlier because he didn‚Äôt know about the dinner invitation. As a result, the Wigginses had no transportation and could not have dinner with the Whitmans. ===\\"The Dickey Boy\\"=== Mrs. Mandy Rose lives with her son, Willy, and her wealthy friend, Miss Elvira Grayson. One day, Hiram Fairbanks, her brother, arrives with a boy he introduces as the orphaned son of the Dickeys, a lower- class family associated with questionable morals. Hiram tells Mrs. Rose that Mrs. Dickey had recently died and that he had brought the Dickey boy to help her out around the house since Willy is too weak to work. Mrs. Rose and Miss Grayson are initially reluctant to take in the Dickey boy, because they question his virtue, but eventually the Dickey boy proves to be both hardworking and trustworthy; in particular when he returns exact change after being sent to the store. Eventually, he earns the favor of the family and is given many gifts: including an apple tree from Mr. Hiram. One day, Mrs. Rose realizes she couldn‚Äôt find one of her silver teaspoons so she accuses the Dickey boy of thievery. The boy denied that he had stolen the silver spoon and runs away leaving his possessions behind. Mrs. Rose decides to look for her spoon among the boy's things. She opens a suspicious nailed box but instead of finding her silver spoon, she finds Mr. Dickey's clay pipe and Mrs. Dickey's calico. At the same time, Willy clears the Dickey boy's name, showing up with the spoon and admitting that he had taken the spoon out to dig his garden and had forgotten to put it back. The adults become worried because the Dickey boy had run away and would be caught up in the incoming storm. Mr. Fairbanks organized a search party and eventually found the Dickey boy in Dickey's tree. Mr. Fairbanks carried the boy home where he received love and trust from Mrs. Rose, Elvira and Willy. ===\\"A Sweet-Grass Basket\\"=== Nancy lives with her parents and her wealthy cousin, Flora, who owns pretty things because her father is well off. One day, the two cousins go off to Indian ground and visit an Indian princess‚Äô tent. Inside the tent were baskets and canoes for sell. One particular 50-cent sweet-grass basket catches the attention of the girls, and Flora expresses that she plans on buying the basket next week, after she receives her allowance from her father on Saturday. This stirs up jealousy in Nancy, who is determined to make the 50 cents and buy the basket before Flora. A few days later, Nancy is sent over to Aunt Lucretia's on and errand. Nancy offers to pick berries for her aunt for a fee. Aunt Lucretia agrees to Nancy's suggestion, offering her seven cents for each quart of blackberries. All week, Nancy worked hard picking blackberries, eventually earning the amount she needed to buy the basket. However, Aunt Lucretia did not have the change to pay her, and asked her to wait a few more days. The next day, Nancy again asked her aunt for money, but her Aunt still had not gotten change. On Saturday, Flora received her money but did not think of buying the basket. This spurred Nancy to go to Aunt Lucretia's once again, to ask for her money. This time she went without permission. Although Lucretia was able to get her money, both her aunt and mother scolded her for her disobedience. The next day after church, Nancy told Flora she wanted to pick flowers, entreating Flora to head home first. Instead of picking flowers, Nancy ran to the Indian camp to buy the sweet-grass basket. When she returned home, her mother scolded her and made her take the basket back to the Indian princess. The princess refused to give back her money. Nancy obeyed her mother, leaving the money and the basket with the princess, but she remained sad, sobbing through supper. The next day, the Indian princess appeared at their door and returned the basket, which Nancy gave to Flora. Later on, Nancy was sent on another errand and the princess returned with more baskets. Flora bought an identical sweet-grass basket for Nancy and surprised Nancy with it. ===\\"Mehitable Lamb\\"=== Hannah Maria Green, a slim teenage girl, is sitting on the doorstep sewing a seam in a sheet when her younger friend, Mehitable Lamb, arrives to visit. Hannah entreats Mehitable to take a walk with her, refuting Mehitable's declaration that her mother may not approve. As they walk, Hannah and Mehitable pass apple orchards and they discuss their affinity for early apples. Then, Hannah remembers that her Uncle Timothy and Aunt Jenny had an orchard with early apples a little ways away from where they were. However, Mehitable Lamb declares that her mother would not like it and refuses to move. This angers Hannah, who taunts Mehitable, saying she is afraid. Hannah decides to venture on, making Mehitable promise not to tattle-tell. That night, Mrs. Green, Hannah's mother, went to the Lambs because she could not find Hannah Maria. However, Mehitable would not tell where Hannah was. In the desperation to find Hannah, Mehitable's Aunt Suzy suggested that Mrs. Lamb whip Mehitable into telling. However, Mehitable continued to refuse to tell where Hannah was even after being whipped. The next day, the Lambs delivered breakfast to the Greens. While they were there, Jenny, Hannah's Aunt, drove into the yard with Hannah Maria in her wagon. Hannah met her mother's anger with grief, expressing remorse and saying she thought Mehitable would‚Äôve told the adults where she was. Eventually, Mrs. Lamb, Aunt Suzy, and Hannah all mended their relationships with Mehitable, and Hannah brought Mehitable some early apples. ==Publication history== The short stories compiled in this collection were originally printed in prominent literary magazines. \\"Young Lucretia\\", \\"How Fidelia Went to the Store\\", \\"Where Sarah Jane's Doll Went\\", \\"Seventoe‚Äôs Ghost\\", \\"Little Mirandy, and How She Earned Her Shoes\\", \\"A Parsnip Stew\\", and \\"A Sweet-Grass Basket\\" were all originally publications that appeared in Harper's Young People between the years 1887 and 1892. \\"Ann Mary; Her Two Thanksgivings\\", \\"Ann Lizy's Patchwork\\", \\"The Little Persian Princess\\", \\"Where the Christmas-Tree Grew\\", \\"The Dickey Boy\\", and \\"Mehitable Lamb\\" were originally published in the St. Nicholas Magazine around the same time period. In 1892, these short stories were collected and published by Harper & Brothers Publishers, and in 1970, the book was reprinted. ==AnalysisSetting=== Freeman often sets her stories in small, local, close-knit towns where neighbors share common values and often interact. She portrays realistic villages in which town members know one another and have close relationships. This is seen in \\"How Fidelia Went to the Store\\" when Fidelia's mother sends her to a store to buy raisins. When Fidelia doesn‚Äôt return home in time, her mother suspects that Ms. Rose, the storekeeper, had kept Fidelia for dinner. At times Freeman highlights the localism of her towns through dialect, as seen in the way her characters often drop the ends of their words. An example of this is seen in ‚ÄúYoung Lucretia‚Äù when Mrs. Emmons says, ‚ÄúI heerd the other day they was goin' to have a Christmas-tree down to the school-house. Now I'd be willin' to ventur' consider'ble that child don't have a thing on't.‚Äù ===Marriage and the role of women=== A common theme in Freeman's stories is the struggle in women between being a submissive woman, who adheres to traditional feminine roles, and being the domineering woman, who gains a more dominant role because she is unable to, or refuses to submit to men.Terryberry, Karl (2002). Gender Instruction in the Tales for Children by Mary E. Wilkins Freeman. Lampter, Wales: The Edwin Mellen Press. p. 9. . The parson's wife in ‚ÄúAnn Lizy's Patchwork‚Äù who is described as ‚Äúsweet, gentle‚Äù and ‚Äúgracious‚Äù is an example of the submissive woman. Another example of the submissive woman fulfilling feminine roles is found in ‚ÄúThe Little Persian Princess.‚Äù In the story, the princess sacrifices her royal position and becomes a cat to follow her brother‚Äîthe male figure in her life.Terryberry, p.25 From the princess's devotion to her brother, Dorothy learns the importance of finding a male partner. She ultimately marries her neighbor. The submissive woman is defined by her marital status,Terryberry, p.17 often relying upon marriage to help her fulfill her household duties. This explains the preoccupation with marriage in many of Mary Wilkins Freeman's stories. For example, in ‚ÄúHow Fidelia Went to the Store‚Äù, the women are extremely focused on preparing for Cynthy's wedding. In the same way, in stories such as ‚ÄúThe Dickey Boy‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere Sarah Jane's Doll Went‚Äù, characters are identified according to their marital status. The second type of woman is one who becomes dominant in the household either due to the absence of men or willfully in revolt of male dominance. The woman domineering in the absence of man generally still submits to feminine ideals. They also rear younger women to submit to men and fulfill traditional female roles. The domineering mother figure is seen in ‚ÄúMehitable Lamb‚Äù in the fact that when Mehitable meets Hannah, Hannah is sewing. Freeman writes that Hannah desires to play with dolls but that ‚Äúthe Doll is packed away... mother said I have other things to tend to. Dolls are well enough for girls like you. Here, you‚Äôd better take her; I‚Äôve got to finish my sewin‚Äô.‚Äù This scene demonstrates that Hannah Maria learns the roles of a woman from her domineering mother‚Äôs instructions.Terryberry, p.64 The character of Grandmother Jennings is another example of the domineering mother figure. Grandmother Jennings holds authority in the household because she has no man to submit to.Terryberry, p.62 Similarly, the female characters that rebel against male dominance ultimately submit to gender roles when they are reminded of their social conditions. For example, Hannah Maria revolts against the rules imposed on the submissive female when she attempts to go to her uncle‚Äôs orchard because ‚ÄúFather walks over sometimes.‚Äù She believes she is equal to her father, a man, and thinks that women are able to do what men do.Terryberry, p.65 However, following the path to the orchard leads Hannah into trouble. Ultimately, Hannah is remorseful and again exhibits selflessness, a trait belonging to the submissive woman, when she gives her apples to Mehitable. ===Moral stories: children and distant mothers=== Freeman was well known for her children's fiction. These stories were moralistic and aimed at teaching children traits such as obedience.Terryberry, p.30 At times they featured mystical creatures as seen in ‚ÄúThe Little Persian Princess‚Äù, and more often than not, they feature na√Øve children and distant mothers. Through the distance of the mothers, children are allowed the license to decide their course of action, which generally leads to misbehavior.Terryberry, p.22 Stories such as ‚ÄúMehitable Lamb‚Äù features the distant mother and the disobedience. Hannah Maria has the opportunity to wander off to her uncle's orchard because her mother had gone to the next town. Sometimes, in place of a mother is a maternal figure such as an aunt or grandmother seen in the example of characters such as Grandmother Jennings in ‚ÄúAnn Lizy's Patchwork.‚Äù These distant mothers exist as role models for the children, representing the cultures and societal norms. Their distant presence ultimately allows the children to recognize their wrong actions and feel remorse. ===Uncivilized vs. civilized=== Unlike her contemporaries, Freeman's stories do not feature overly wicked villains or external influences of industrialized metropolis. The only foreign influence in these stories is that of Indians. Through the Indians interactions in ‚ÄúThe Sweat-Grass Basket‚Äù with two white children, Nancy and Flora, Freeman demonstrates cultural distinction and white supremacy. Initially, Nancy and Flora are described as intrigued but scared to approach the Indians. This demonstrates the cultural division and the fear that ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù children have for what they consider to be \\"uncivilized\\" and mystical.Terryberry, p.46 Similarly, Freeman herself highlights this racial hierarchical difference through her environmental descriptions; she sets whites in towns and houses and Indians in swamps and tents.Terryberry, p.45 Other cases in which Freeman portrays Native Americans as inferior can be seen when she attributes cruelty and dull-wittedness to the race, stating, ‚ÄúThat stout Indian Princess displayed ‚Ä¶a witty shrewdness which seemed abnormal‚Ä¶Perhaps something of the ancient cruelty of her race possessed her.‚Äù Along with the portrayal of Indian culture as subordinate to white culture is the suggestion that white children should abide by their superior cultural codes. This is also seen in \\"The Sweat-Grass Basket.\\" Due to the fact that Nancy buys the basket on Sunday, she breaks the Sabbath, an established cultural rule. Ultimately, she has to set this wrong right, and she is ordered to return the basket to camp.Terryberry, p.53 ==Critical reception== Mary Wilkins Freeman was highly popular, producing up to 200 short stories in her time.Terryberry, p.ix Between 1883 and 1889, she managed to print 52 of her short stories, many of which appeared in popular Harper's publications. Among these are: ‚ÄúYoung Lucretia‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow Fidelia Went to the Store‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere Sarah Jane's Doll Went‚Äù, ‚ÄúSeventoe‚Äôs Ghost‚Äù, and ‚ÄúA Parsnip Stew‚Äù, which reappeared in Young Lucretia and Other Stories. The publication of Young Lucretia and Other Stories follows that of A New England Nun, and Other Stories, which contain two of Freeman's most popular works: \\"A New England Nun\\" and \\"The Revolt of Mother\\". However, Freeman did not disappoint, and the Athenaeum gave Young Lucretia and Other Stories a positive review, commenting on the \\"artful simplicity of the style\\" and the \\"dramatic boldness of the narrative\\". Some scholars have criticized some of Freeman's depictions of minorities, such as showing \\"a gnomish Black man as weak, easily fooled, and child-like\\". ==References External links == *Young Lucretia and Other Stories at Project Gutenberg Category:American short story collections Category:1892 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Mary E.

Wilkins, first published in 1899. It narrated in the first person by a character named Sophia. The story she tells began six years before and takes place in a small New England town, often referred to as a village, named Linnville. The town is set in the country and is composed of a small community where people are by no means rich, but are able to live comfortably. The lifestyles and traditions of the community are disrupted, in both positive and negative ways, when the Jamesons come to town. The Jamesons are a very wealthy family from New York City who come to Linville for the summer, and eventually buy a permanent summer home there. The mother of the family, Mrs. H. Boardman Jameson, tries to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the community through readings of formal literature and attempts to change the way the people eat, dress and decorate their homes on both the interior and the exterior. Many people are unhappy about her superior attitude and total disregard of other people's opinions on the changes she attempts to make, but she gains respect at the end of the novel after planning an elaborate Centennial celebration for the town. ==Plot summary== The residents of Linnville prided themselves on the lack of tourism and absence of a summer hotel. Never having boarders before, the Liscom family, accepted the Jamesons when they came to town in search for a place to stay. Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks. The Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were ‚Äúpoison‚Äù and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened. Mrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to ‚Äúimprove their minds and enlarge their spheres‚Äù by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them. Several weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville. For their second summer, they purchase their own home and farm to run. Mrs. Jameson is clueless as to how a farm should be run, and as a result is the victim of some tricks when purchasing animals for the barn. Besides the barn, there are some other changes Mrs. Jameson has made herself and she tries to impose them on the community, as she did with her health foods the previous summer. First, she stops wearing the fancy city clothes she had worn in the past and begins wearing what she thinks is most practical for a country person to wear. She proceeds to insult and instruct the other women to adopt the same style as her. Some women do follow her, but many do not. Mrs. Jameson continues to make bold statements against the traditions of Linnville and paints her house red with dark shutters, while every other house is white with green shutters. She then decides that the town would look better if the houses had ivy growing on them, and plants ivy around everyone's homes, without their permission. It is later discovered this ivy is poison ivy and she has to go back to the houses and remove it all. She tries to change the interiors of people's homes as well by getting rid of framed- coffin plates of deceased loved ones in the parlors, a common d√©cor in the homes of Linnville. With every act against the norms of Linnville, Mrs. Jameson gets more and more enemies. She is so distracted with trying to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù Linnville that she does not notice that one of her daughters is in a clandestine relationship with the Liscom boy, who Mrs. Jameson does not approve of due to his family's inferior social standing to her own. Eventually, the young lovers are caught, and both of their mothers are furious. Mrs. Liscom does not approve of Harriett Jameson because she is not trained in housekeeping. An expected turn of events leads Mrs. Liscom to adore Harriett though, and the two get married at the end of the novel. The unexpected change occurs during a Centennial party that Mrs. Jameson organizes for the town's 100th birthday. She collects the oldest furniture from houses all around the town and decorates the oldest house in town with all of it. She invites celebrities with connections to Linnville, organizes a parade, and sets up a dinner with speeches from honorable people. The event goes well and many people have a newfound respect for Mrs. Jameson but towards the end, Harriett's dress catches on fire, putting an end to the celebration. It is Mrs. Liscom who saves Harriett, and from that moment on they become very close to each other. Harriett does not suffer from any severe wounds, and takes housekeeping lessons from Mrs. Liscom until the wedding. Mrs. Jameson accepts Harry Liscom as her son-in-law as well and in the end, people learn to love the Jameson family collectively and are happy they came to town, despite the drama they brought along with them. ==Characters== Mrs. H. Boardman Jameson is the protagonist of the novel. She is a wealthy woman with weak nerves and has very particular wants and needs. She refuses to eat unhealthy foods, and looks down upon those who do. When she wants to make changes in the town she often assumes permission without asking anyone, and therefore is not very well liked throughout the majority of the novel. Sophia is the first-person narrator of the story. She is a widow and has a heart condition. She does not know how to react to Mrs. Jameson's actions in the beginning and middle of the novel, but grows to adore her by the end. She also loves Harriet Jameson and supports her relationship with Harry Liscom. Mrs. Caroline Liscom is the most notable housekeeper and probably the wealthiest woman in Linnville, besides Mrs. Jameson. She takes the Jamesons in as boarders. She has the reputation of being a strong character, and is the head of her family. She has trouble believing things she does not want to be true, and this is seen when she tries to ignore her idea of her son having a clandestine relationship with Harriet. Harriet Jameson is a very beautiful girl and is often very embarrassed by her mother. She is sweet and meek, very different from her mother. She is unaffected by her family's money and loves Harry for who he is, despite her mother's disapproval. Grandma Cobb is the grandma in the Jameson family. Mrs. Jameson is her daughter. She is very sociable and spends the majority of her time visiting people throughout the day from house to house. She discloses all of the Jameson's business and often disagrees with her daughter's words and behaviors. She always dresses in black silk, which is regarded as one of the nicest things a woman could wear to those in Linnville. She also always carries peppermints and a mysterious novel that she never reads. Harry Liscom is a church member and is seen as a handsome, brave young man in the community. He marries Harriett Jameson. Jonas Martin is an old man who helps Mrs. Jameson plant the poison ivy around all of the houses in town. He receives some criticism for this, but defends himself by reminding people how hard it is to stand up against Mrs. Jameson. Flora Clark is a prominent woman in Linnville. She is high-spirited and proud, as well as intelligent and pretty. Her only flaw is her bad temper and she is not afraid of anyone. As a result of her personality, Flora is not fond of Mrs. Jameson and is one of the few people in the novel who stands up to her when she refuses to read the literature that Mrs. Jameson wants her to at a sewing meeting. Louisa Field is Sophia's brother's widowed wife. She has a daughter named Alice and is the head of the district school. She is very close to Sophia and always agrees with Sophia's thoughts of Mrs. Jameson. Alice is Louisa's daughter and Sophia's young niece. Cobb Jameson appears to be afraid of everything. We do not know if this is actually the case, or if his big blue eyes, parted mouth, and long curly hair just gives him this look of constant fear. Mr. H. Boardman Jameson does not have a prominent role in the novel because he is always working in the city while the family summers in Linnville. He used to be very wealthy, but lost his money after his bank failed. He continued to be successful though after he obtained a job from a friend in a custom-house in New York City. ==Themes== One of the major underlying themes of the novel is the wide difference in lifestyles between upper and lower socio-economic classes, and the ideas that are instilled in people based on their wealth. The people in Linnville emphasize close relationships with other members of the community, and do not feel the need to accessorize their lives with unnecessary luxuries. They are willing to work hard to make a living, are unaffected by how well one dresses or how nice their home is, and enjoy socializing whether it is in a Sewing or Literature Club, or at town picnics. Mrs. Jameson, on the other hand, is more concerned with fashion, food, and beauty than the relationships she forms. While everyone in Linnville treats each other with respect and equality after years of friendship, Mrs. Jameson assumes power just because she is wealthier than the others in the community. She believes her money gives her the power to change a town she is new to, and that she can order people around. She expects them to assimilate to her ideal lifestyle, and will do whatever she can to get as close as possible to this goal. Mrs. Jameson thinks she and her family are better than the rest in every aspect of life, from fashion to interior design and education. In essence, one of the themes is that money gives people power to do whatever they wish and instills a sense of superiority in those who have a lot of it. Another theme is the difference between city and country life in general. At the beginning of the novel, the people of Linnville find the Jameson's city apparel to be absurd, and even comment on how different their names are. Sophia says that the names Harriet and Sarah ‚Äúseemed rather odd taste in these city people‚Äù (Wilkins page 37), and that in the country they prefer Hattie and Sadie. Mrs. Jameson attempts to corrupt the innocence and simplicity of Linnville by modernizing it and introducing customs from her wealthy, city life to its people. Due to even the subtle differences between city and country people, it is hard for the people of Linnville to get along with the Jameson's at first, and clearly it is difficult for Mrs. Jameson as well, or she would not try to make changes around town to satisfy her desires. Another theme of the novel, also pertaining to socio-economic class and other differences between country and city life is reform. Throughout the novel Mrs. Jameson tries to reform the entire town by introducing her own customs. She tries to make the people eat the healthy foods she does, dress the way she does, educate them with formal literature she enjoys, and even tries to beautify the town itself. Instead of adapting to the town she is new to, Mrs. Jameson tries to change the town to accommodate her. In essence, the town of Linnville is unsophisticated and unaware of rural life and as a result, Mrs. Jameson single-handedly tries to completely reform the town into one of higher social standing through both its community and its visual appearance. ==Critical reception== Although Mary E. Wilkins was considered the \\"most prolific American female short story writer of her era\\", The Jamesons did not receive a lot of praise. According to a Professor Hieronimus, \\"Any writer of experience could have produced it with little effort.\\" A similar comment was made in The Ladies Home Journal that said the novel is \\"the drollest story ever written of a modern, up-to-date city woman in a village.\\" Another critic in The Living Age also noted the lack of amusement in the novel and says, \\"Miss Wilkins looks at New England life from a more light and humorous standpoint than usual‚Ä¶the catastrophes that result are not too direful to be amusing.\\" The most positive reviews of The Jamesons all mentioned the humor of the novel, just as the comment above. Another review from The Critic called the novel \\"quaintly humorous\\". A review in the New York Times praised the book as a \\"light read\\" that \\"occupies a niche of well-deserved respect in our minds. It contains no elaborate system of thought or economics. We are merely introduced to a few amiable housewives, chat a little, while upon the current topics of the village, and, with a thought here and there for each other‚Äôs health, disperse. Mary E. Wilkins has the patronage of busy people, for this book can be read in a couple of hours.\\" Despite the criticism of The Jamesons as an overall boring novel, according to The Living Age, it was a \\"Book of the Month\\" in June 1899. ==Sales== According to The Bookmart on June 1, 1899, the May publication sales reached the average for the season and The Jamesons had a large first sale. When the article in The Bookmart was published, The Jamesons was 10th on a list of the 15 best selling books at the time. The novel sold for one dollar a copy. It was also noted in McClures Magazine that The Jamesons was a \\"specially successful recent book\\". ==References== Category:1899 American novels Category:New England in fiction ","title":"The Jamesons"},{"id":"35833854","text":"Mazrek is a settlement in the former Guri i Zi municipality, Shkod√´r County, northern Albania.

From 1870 to 1873, Snow served as a missionary for the LDS Church in the United Kingdom. In October 1873, he married Mary B. Peirce. In 1875, Snow served another mission, this time in the Eastern States Mission, based in New York City. In 1877, when the Box Elder Stake of the LDS Church was organized, encompassing all of Box Elder County, Utah, and headquartered in Brigham City, Snow was made the stake president, in many ways succeeding his father who had been essentially functioning like a stake president. Snow was released as stake president in 1888. From 1880 to 1886, he served as a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature from Box Elder County. Snow died in Los Angeles, California. ==References== *Andrew Jenson. Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia. Salt Lake City: Andrwew Jensen Publishing Company, 1901. Vol. 1, p. 389\\\\.

The relay was nicknamed the \\"relay of peace\\". It was only the second occasion that a torch relay was held for the Olympics; the first was at the 1936 Summer Olympics. There were three types of torches designed for use on the relay: a standard solid fuel powered torch made of aluminium, a special butane gas torch used on board HMS Whitesand Bay, and a final torch used to enter Empire Stadium that was made of stainless steel and powered by a magnesium candle. The route itself was initially designed to be a direct one from Olympia to Wembley, taking in Italy, Switzerland and France. Belgium and Luxembourg were added to the route after those countries requested it. It was expected that the Greek part of the relay would be , but was reduced to due to concerns over security. After the 12-day journey, the torch arrived at the Empire Stadium only thirty seconds later than expected. ==Background== Despite hosting the 1908 Summer Olympics, the 1948 Games was the first London-based games to have a torch relay after it was introduced at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Former British athlete David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter, and the rest of the organising committee for the 1948 Games agreed to continue the tradition begun by the previous games, and run a torch relay for a second time. ==Relay elementsTorch=== Each of the torches contained a solid fuel tablet made of hexamine and 6% naphthalene (following torch running tests in May 1947) that fuelled the flame itself. The solid fuel increased the distance each runner could run to over flat terrain, decreasing the number of torches needed to be produced, which in turn reduced the cost of the relay. There were eight tablets loaded into each torch, with the bottom tablets pushed up by the use of a spring. The design increased the burning time of each torch up to around fifteen minutes, an increase from the four-minute torches of the 1936 Olympics. The torch itself was designed by Ralph Lavers, with the brief that it should be \\"inexpensive and easy to make, of pleasing appearance and a good example of British craftmanship\\". The torches were made from aluminium, with a long shaft holding a cup that contained the burner. \\"With thanks to the bearer\\" was written on the cup of the torch itself, along with the Olympic rings. The torches for the Greek leg of the relay were shipped to the Mediterranean aboard HMS Liverpool, along with a purpose built torch for the leg aboard a Royal Navy vessel from Corfu to Italy. A differently designed torch was used for the final leg. It was made of stainless steel and was fueled by magnesium in order to ensure that the flame showed up properly during the opening ceremony. It was also designed by Ralph Lavers, with the frame for the torch created by EMI, and the magnesium candle supplied by Wessex Aircraft Engineering. Neither the suppliers nor designer charged a fee for the final torch.Official Report (1948): p. 210 ===Planned torch route=== The Olympic torch relay route for the 1948 Summer Olympics ;Key As planned { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\"  - !scope=\\"col\\" Location !scope=\\"col\\" Distance !scope=\\"col\\" Stages !scope=\\"col\\" Torches - Greece  ccccff\\"   ccccff\\"  300  324 -     6 - Italy   500  540 - Switzerland  135  144 - France (i)  270  300 - Luxembourg   42 - Belgium  108 120 - France (ii)   -     12 - England (Dover - Wembley)   80 - England (Wembley - Torquay)  107  120 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" Total   1531 1688 } :Source: The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV OlympiadOfficial Report (1948): p. 212 ===Torch route=== While the general negotiation with other countries and the specific route were handled by the Organising Committee for the Games, the detailed organisation was delegated to a subgroup led by F.W. Collins.Official Report (1948): p. 22 Due to cost implications, the extensive route conducted by the 1936 Games was ruled out.Official Report (1948): p. 209 Instead, the simplest route from Olympia to London was to be used, going by sea to Italy and then run through Switzerland and France. The route was modified only when Luxembourg and Belgium both requested that the torch travel their territories. A longer Greek route was planned, but reduced from an expected down to due to concerns over instability in the country and a lack of security. The torch lighting ceremony took place on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector, which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia.Official Report (1948): p. 217 In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as a gift from the Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7 pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed overnight in the city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30 pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane gas torch in order to ensure that there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours. The ship dropped the torch off in Bari at 12:30 pm on 19 July. It was run north through several Italian cities before crossing the Simplon Pass into Brig, Switzerland on 23 July. From there it was run west until leaving the country at Perly-Certoux, and entering France at Saint- Julien-en-Genevois. The route then detours from the direct route to take in Luxembourg and into Belgium before re-entering France at Lille on 28 July, finally departing the country at Calais. HMS Bicester carried the torch across the English Channel to Dover, arriving at 8:25 pm on 28 July. It travelled through several towns in the South East of England until it arrived at Wembley, where it arrived only thirty seconds late after the entire journey. That delay may have only been in the final few hundred yards of the relay down Olympic Way outside of Empire Stadium as the pressure of the crowds on the torch carrier and their escorts reduced the pace to walking speed. Special celebrations were held at each border crossing, and at Pierre de Coubertin's tomb in Lausanne, Switzerland. It was agreed for a secondary Olympic Flame to be lit in Torquay during the games, and a secondary torch relay was conducted to take the flame from Wembley south to the coast to Torquay. The arrangements were the same as from Dover to Wembley but in reverse.Official Report (1948): p. 213 ==References== ;Specific ;General * Category:Olympic torch relays Category:1948 Summer Olympics ","title":"1948 Summer Olympics torch relay"},{"id":"35834066","text":"A Business Career is a novel by African-American author Charles Chesnutt that features the life of a \\"new woman\\" of the late 19th century; she enters the world of business instead of embracing the traditional roles of women. It explores a failed romance between two successful upper-class members. A family‚Äôs vendetta against the man who allegedly destroyed the family's fortune is revealed to be mistaken. The novel was unusual for its time as Chesnutt wrote only about white society. The book was completed in 1890 but Chesnutt, who had published only a few short stories by then, was unable to interest a publisher in it. The book's depiction of white society may have contributed to that failure. Editor Walter Hines Page, who declined the book, nevertheless encouraged Chesnutt in his writing and later published other works by him. Since the late 20th century, there has been a revival of interest in Chesnutt. This novel was published posthumously in 2005 with an introduction and editing by Matthew Wilson. == Plot summary == The story takes place in 1890s in the Midwest city of Groveland (critics consider this a fictional stand-in for Cleveland, where Chesnutt lived). At the Truscott Refining Company, the male stenographer has just been fired. Stella Merwin fills in temporarily; she has already learned shorthand. When an opportunity opens up, she stays in the job longer than intended. The company is owned by the man whom her family believes has destroyed its reputation and honor. Stella Merwin's father, Henry, was a very successful man in the oil refining business, providing the Merwin family with status and a life of wealth. At the peak of his success, he hit financial troubles. These led to the loss of the family fortune as well as his death, attributed to heart disease. Before his death, Merwin assured his family: his wife, daughter Stella and son George, that they would be taken care of financially by his profitable investments. He directed them to see his most trusted employee, Wendell Truscott for assistance in the matter, as Merwin had given him related papers. With the loss of their wealth, the Merwins must change their lives. They move from the city to a small town where they lived off a small annual income produced by the estate and additional money earned from Mrs. Merwin‚Äôs writing career. This was enough money to give Stella a strong education, but a far cry from what the family was used to during their good times. Mrs. Merwin blames the family‚Äôs financial difficulties on Wendell Truscott because she believes that he ruined her husband and, stole money from him, and took over his company. Because of the complicated history between Wendell Truscott and the Merwin family, Stella Merwin takes her job under the false name Miss Smith. She wants the job in order to lean more about Truscott, whom she has been told to despise as the man who caused her family's financial downfall. Stella comes to swift judgments about her employer. She concludes that he is a cold-hearted boss who does not care about establishing relationships with his employees, but also that he is a very smart, savvy businessman who efficiently gets missions accomplished. Stella quickly takes a liking to her job, which starts out with her transcribing letters dictated by Truscott. Impressed with her performance, Truscott increases her responsibilities; he entrusts her to write letters according to his direction. instead of copying what the proprietor says, she gains his trust enough to write letters on her own, and gives her the charge of reviewing the financial books daily. Mrs. Merwin is thrilled that Stella is working for The Truscott Refining Company. She does not care that Stella is getting great experience in the business world and her schooling in shorthand is being put to good use; instead, she wants Stella to use her position in the office to infiltrate Truscott's files to find evidence that he committed fraud against Henry Merwin to restore the family to their previous position of wealth. Stella struggles slightly with the moral implications of betraying her boss, but she will do anything to help her family leading to her decision to find the incriminating documents. The mother visits her daughter and as they walk around the city she comments on how the rich residents made their money insisting that they did so in a dishonorable fashion. The only people that Mrs. Merwin believes amassed their fortune nobly are her husband and her friend Matilda Wedderburn. Besides for being Mrs. Merwin's old friend, Matilda Wedderburn is the love interest of Wendell Truscott. Matilda inherited great wealth from her father, and is a leader in literary and musical circles. She is a very independent woman whose only reason to marry is for true love because she has everything else on her own. Miss Weddburn and Truscott have known each other forever, but their courtship intensifies as they engage in activities together such as going to the theater. Matilda says Wendell is as close to her perfect man that she has ever met. She invites him to her home for dinner hoping that he will ask her to marry him there. Wendell has the same feelings for Miss Wedderburn so he writes a response to Matilda‚Äôs invitation that implies that he is planning on asking her to marry him that night; however, Truscott notices that his stenographer Miss Smith (Stella) is a beautiful young lady. He changes his mind when, \\"It occurred to him as he sat there, that perhaps a woman might be young in years, and yet not immature in mind, and that youth might possess a charm that maturity would lack.\\" Truscott tears up the letter and instead writes a less passionate response. When that night comes the two are in an intimate setting in which Matilda expects Wendell to ask her to marry her, but instead he abruptly leaves crushing her hopes of marriage. Later on Miss Wedderburn visits the office of The Truscott Refining Company where she recognizes Miss Smith as the Merwin‚Äôs daughter, and she suspects that the young stenographer is the reason Truscott has a change of heart. While reviewing the daily reports Stella notices that something is inconsistent in the books, so she decides to look into the matter on a Sunday when nobody will be in the office. After reviewing the books she concludes that the bookkeeper Mr. Ross has stolen $20,000 from the company. While Stella is still there Ross comes in and finds the ledger on his desk along with a piece of paper that Stella had written on. Mr. Ross finds Stella hiding in the closet and knocks her out. Stella wakes up locks in a wardrobe; luckily she is able to escape by climbing through the roof of the wardrobe so she can go alert Mr. Truscott about Mr. Ross‚Äôs transgression. Truscott is very pleased that she discovers this crime, but by the time they inform the authorities Ross leaves town and makes it all the way to a South American country where there is no extradition. The next Sunday Stella again visits the office in order to search for the documents believed to because this time in search of the documents that will restore her family's wealth. Stella believes the necessary papers are in the safe in Truscott's private office that she access to because of his special trust in her. She looks through the safe without success, but she knows there is a special compartment with an additional lock. She gets the key from Truscott's desk and successful finds the papers in the locked compartment. At the same time Stella is in the office, Truscott goes to a dinner at the Country Club hosted by General Farwell. At the dinner the wealthy guests receive news from Wall Street that a bank in London collapsed and a financial crisis is imminent. Truscott is hit hard by the crisis and as a result cannot get banks to lend him money for the big project he has been working on thereby putting it on the verge of failure. Stella reviews the papers in her boarding house that night. The papers show the scheme that her father was planning that is very similar to Truscott's current endeavor revolutionizing the oil refining industry. The papers show $2 million in stock that her father has investment in his new company Universal Subterranean Development Company. She believes that this is the evidence that will prove their wealth; however, Stella then sees through the documents how her father's plan failed because of an economic collapse and the failures of his unscrupulous business partners. This proves that Wendell Truscott never stole from her father; it was Henry Merwin‚Äôs own fault that the family lost its fortune. Stella's findings cement the family's place outside the upper class of society and prevent Mrs. Merwin's dream of returning to their previous life impossible. She also learns that the income the family has been receiving was not generated by the Merwin estate but actually is Truscott's charity for the family. Stella returns the stolen papers to Mr. Truscott accompanied by a letter explaining her true identity as well as giving him her reason for resignation of the position. She thanks him for his generosity to the family and apologizes for taking advantage of the trust he showed her. The Truscott Refining Company is at the brink of collapse because the company needs $200,000 that it owes to its creditors. Luckily Matilda Wedderburn comes to Truscott‚Äôs rescue, even though he put their romance to an end, by offering her good friend the money that he desperately needs therefore saving the company. Stella moves back to Cloverdale leaving Groveland in her rear-view mirror because she wants to forget about her experience working for Wendell Truscott as much as possible. She soon receives a letter from Truscott asking her to come back to work because he cannot find anyone who did as good a job as she did, but more importantly he wants her to come back because she loves him. In the letter Truscott says, \\"Come back to me, dear child, or let me come to you, and we will part no more forever, as long as we both shall live.\\" == Characters == Stella Merwin (Miss Smith): The protagonist of the novel is a \\"new woman\\" of the late 19th century who pursues a life outside the traditional roles of wife and mother. As a junior in college, she learns shorthand, which enables her to secure a job as a stenographer. She works for The Truscott Refining Company with the objective of trying to find documents to restore her family‚Äôs wealth. Wendell Truscott: The wealthy proprietor of the Truscott Refining Company whom the Merwin family blames for their financial ruin. He is a crafty businessman. It is revealed that he never betrayed his mentor Henry Merwin, but provided for his family. Mrs. Paxton: Stella‚Äôs mentor who gets her the job at Truscott Refining. She guides Stella in the business world and becomes a friend. Mr. Peters: The former stenographer, fired for tardiness due to excessive drinking. Mr. Ross: The bookkeeper of Truscott Refining, who steals $20,000 from the company, but escapes to South America. Stella Merwin's judgment of him is proved true by events. Matilda Wedderburn: A beautiful, wealthy woman being courted by Wendell Truscott. Her hopes of marrying him end when he \\"falls for\\" Stella Merwin. As a friend, she loans Truscott money to save the company. Mrs. Merwin: The mother of Stella and George, and wife of Henry Merwin. The widow has trouble dealing with her decline in status and yearns to return to her high place in society George Merwin: Stella‚Äôs brother, who also lives and works in Groveland. George has a gambling problem and falls into debt, leading to his arrest. He is saved by a stranger, revealed to be Wendell Truscott, whom the Merwin family considers an enemy. He is sent to a ranch in the West for rehabilitation. == Themes  The new women === The major theme of this novel is the emergence of the new woman in American society at the turn of the century. Mrs. Merwin exemplifies the traditional female role as a mother and wife, but Stella Merwin pursues higher education. Her schooling allows her to get a job in the business world that pays a substantial salary. Stella has the financial independence to thrive without relying on a husband. During this period, the number of women working in offices, previously limited to men, was on the rise. Gradually women replaced men as clerks and stenographers. === Status === Chesnutt explores the financial inequality in the structure of society. This era was known for the vast disparity in wealth between the classes, as the upper class lived in luxurious mansions with many servants and enjoyed the theatre, but the lower class struggled through life by working long hours in a factory or office. The Merwins family's drastic decline in financial standing is similar to that of the title character in William Dean Howells' novel The Rise of Silas Lapham, now considered a literary classic. Chesnutt explores Mrs. Merwin's difficulty as a beleaguered widow, no longer in the upper class. === Realism === Chesnutt wrote a novel of Realism, portraying society, as was the major form of his time. He did not use a high style of elaborate language or refer to the mythical characters popular in an earlier generation. The novel effectively captures the business world by describing The Truscott Refining Company‚Äôs inner workings. === Romance === The novel follows the form of a romance, as Matilda Wedderburn and Wendell Truscott engage in a courtship. This fails after he falls for his young stenographer. The courtship is highlighted by nights out at the theatre and dinner parties with the family. It omits the sexual component prevalent in modern courtship and portrayed in current literature. The romantic plot was also featured in Howells' novel, The Rise of Silas Lapham. ==Context== When Chesnutt completed his novel in 1890, he was unable to find a publisher for it. At the time he had published only a few short stories set in the South, recounting the culture of slave life on plantations. Although Houghton Mifflin chose not to publish the novel, editor Walter Hines Page advised Chesnutt, \\"You will doubtless be able to find a publisher, and my advice to you is decidedly to keep trying till you do find one.\\" Page encouraged Chesnutt in his career, and later Houghton Mifflin published other works by him. Twenty- first century scholar Matthew Wilson believes Chesnutt may have been trying to appeal in this work to white readers, who made up most of the market for literature. Chesnutt, along with Paul Laurence Dunbar, was one of the first African-American writers to write in the \\"white life\\" genre, to portray only white characters and white society. Dunbar‚Äôs novel, The Uncalled, was published in 1901,The Uncalled (1901), Gutenberg Project but failed to sell successfully. Matthew Wilson says about African-American authors at the turn of the 20th century: > \\"Very little expressed interest in representations of whiteness in the black > imagination. Black cultural and social critics allude to such > representations in their writing, yet only a few have dared to make explicit > those perceptions of whiteness that they think will discomfort or antagonize > readers.\\" He describes Chesnutt and Dunbar as pushing the prescribed limits of race in their writings. Charles Chesnutt viewed his work differently than most in terms of its racial implications. After receiving an award from the NAACP in the early 1900s, Chesnutt said he was \\"Not a Negro writing about Negroes, but a human being writing about other human beings.\\" He did not see color in his writing. But, many critics considered African Americans to be inferior writers who had to stay in their own \\"league\\". At the time, books about the antebellum South were popular. It was a time of reconciliation between the North and South, and members of the Northern literary establishment were interested in black writers who portrayed the slavery years. Chesnutt published his novels A House Behind the Cedars (1900) and The Marrow of Tradition (1901), following his success with two short story collections in 1899. They addressed issues of racial inequality and racial mixing. But The Marrow of Tradition went further, featuring a range of white characters, who included an elite white family, as well as a black family of mixed race. Young women in the two families were half-sisters who had the same white father, a man of the elite class. Chesnutt also addressed competition among classes of whites by the late 19th century, as some lower-class men achieved new wealth and political power. Based on the background to North Carolina's disfranchisement of blacks in the late 1890s and events of the 1898 Wilmington Race Riot, in which whites conducted a coup d'√©tat of the elected city government, the novel was described by William Dean Howells as \\"bitter.\\" It is not known whether Chesnutt tried to find another publisher for A Business Career, but it was among his six unpublished manuscripts found at the time of his death. In his introduction to this novel, editor Mathew Wilson says, \\"African American writers have had no right to represent white-life exclusively because to grant that right would be to acknowledge the permeability of the color line\\". Wilson believes that Chesnutt has still not received the recognition he deserves for this pioneering effort in crossing the color line to write about white society. == Critical reception == When it was published in 2005 over a century after it was written, A Business Career received little attention from critics or readers. One of the first of its kind, the novel has faded to the edge of American Literature. == Bibliography == *Chesnutt, Charles W., A Business Career, ed.

Donations are used by the Local Coordination Committees (LCC), a network of groups that have organized the protests, documented the uprising and disseminated that information and visuals around the world. These committees funnel medical supplies, food and telecommunication equipment such as satellite modems to activists inside Syria to keep their cause alive as the military of President Bashar al Assad pounds their cities with artillery. Since the program launched in late 2011, the website shows two dozen LCCs in Syria have reached their funding goals. The website lists the name of the committee, information about the town and its situation and the detailed financial need. Activists say what is crucial is funding for Internet and phone communication because communications infrastructure has been destroyed in towns coming under intensified shelling such as Homs. International media have been barred from entering Syria, so the outside world is dependent on the LCCs for information from the country. \\"Media coverage is highly important, and it is one of the only weapons activists have,\\" said Elias Perabo, one of the founders. \\"The main task is people documenting and getting footage out of the country to get a glimpse of what is happening on the ground and to show the world what the brutality is like. We are trying to smuggle in stuff like cameras before the army comes steaming into a city, so people can film and document.\\" Adopt a Revolution says it does not accept government money and works through the LCCs, the Syrian Revolution General Commission, a coalition of 40 opposition groups and the Assembly of the Syrian Kurdish Youths Abroad.Louise Osborne (2/28/2012) ‚ÄúSyrian activists appeal to West to be adopted‚Äù, USA Today.Electron Libre (01/03/2012) ‚ÄúSyrian activists appeal to West to be adopted‚Äù , France 24.

Millar was a leading member of the West Belfast Brigade of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) until 2003 when he was one of a number of dissident members forcibly expelled from the group. ==Early years== Sham Millar was born in Belfast to a Protestant family and made his home in the Shankill Road area of west Belfast. He is the son of Wendy Millar, who was a leading figure in the UDA's women's unit. Along with contemporaries such as his brother Herbie, Johnny Adair, Sam McCrory, \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson and Donald Hodgen, Millar was part of a skinhead gang that was involved in petty and violent crime in and around the lower Shankill in the early 1980s.Wood, p. 155 ==Joining the UDA== The skinhead gang as a whole were sworn into the UDA in 1984 and assigned to C8 the eighth active unit of C Company, the section of the West Belfast Brigade that was active in the lower Shankill.Lister & Jordan, p. 47 Millar, Adair, Thompson and McCrory initially formed an active unit that drove around neighbouring republican areas looking for and occasionally attacking targets, notably Sinn F√©in councillor Sean Keenan, whom the group injured in a shooting at his Andersonstown home in June 1990.Lister & Jordan, p. 89 Like Thompson, Millar was heavy set, although at 16 stone he weighed six stone less than his friend.Lister & Jordan, p. 86 Bearing a number of tattoos like his fellow C Company members, Millar's most notorious tattoo was the legend \\"Fuck Taigs\\" across the back of his neck.Lister & Jordan, p. 87 According to David Lister and Hugh Jordan Millar committed his first murder on 31 July 1990 when he killed Catholic civilian John Judge at his home on the Falls Road. With McCrory driving, Millar, Thompson and a third unidentified gunman crossed the peace line before shooting Judge, with Millar firing the fatal shots after Thompson had initially wounded the victim. The attack occurred as Judge was talking with a number of friends outside his house, where his son's fifth birthday party was taking place. The attack was claimed by the UDA under its \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" codename two days later. The statement claimed that the attack was in revenge for the murder of Conservative Party MP Ian Gow and added that Judge was a \\"known IRA bomber\\", a claim rejected by both Sinn F√©in and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).Lister & Jordan, pp, 85‚Äì87 Millar and Thompson were arrested for Judge's murder although neither was charged in the end.Lister & Jordan, p. 91 Soon after his release a warrant was put out for Millar's arrest again after Katherine Spruce, a former girlfriend of Adair's who claimed to have been manhandled and forcibly ejected from Adair's flat by members of C Company after the pair had a row, went to the police and volunteered information about the plotting being done by Adair, Millar and others at Adair's flat. Millar went on the run to avoid arrest.Lister & Jordan, p. 93 The allegations made by Spruce did not stand up however and before long Millar was back on the Shankill in Adair's company.Lister & Jordan, p. 102 ==Adair as Brigadier== Adair became Brigadier in West Belfast in 1993 and, according to RUC Special Branch reports into their activity, the Brigade became much more active in drug dealing after this, with Millar named as one of 26 main dealers active in the area in 1995.Lister & Jordan, pp. 268‚Äì269 According to further RUC files by 1999 Millar, who was recognised as the senior operative in the drug peddling arm, was making as much as ¬£10,000 a week through dealing.Lister & Jordan, p. 284 Millar's appetite for wealth earned him the second nickname of \\"Boss Hogg\\" after the notoriously money- driven character from The Dukes of Hazzard. At this time Millar was living in the \\"Beirut\\" area of the lower Shankill, where close neighbours included Adair, Thompson, Hodgen and Winkie Dodds and from where C Company operated a dedicated drugs flat.Lister & Jordan, p. 285 On 19 August 2000 Adair organised a \\"loyalist day of culture\\" on the lower Shankill, inviting the five other UDA brigadiers ‚Äì Jim Gray (East Belfast), John Gregg (South East Antrim), Jackie McDonald (South Belfast), Billy McFarland (Londonderry and North Antrim) and Jimbo Simpson (North Belfast) ‚Äì Ulster Democratic Party politicians John White and Frank McCoubrey and Michael Stone to a festival of loyalist marching bands and a show of strength by the West Belfast Brigade. Around 3 pm that day the UDA's marching band passed the Rex Bar, a known stronghold of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) on the mid Shankill, where they unfurled the banner of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), a UVF splinter group that Adair was close to. The LVF man and his supporters were attacked by UVF members although after a brief fight word went down the Shankill and C Company, at the time being led by Gary \\"Smickers\\" Smith, ran up the road to attack the UVF. Although they had by then barricaded themselves inside the Rex Bar a number of UVF members were injured in the attack with Millar filmed by TV cameras that were there to cover the day of culture being shown beating a UVF member about the head four times with an iron bar.Lister & Jordan, pp. 288‚Äì289 Adair began to feud with the rest of the UDA in 2002 and on 20 September of that year Adair was summoned to a meeting of the Inner Council, the name given to the six brigadiers, in Belfast's Sandy Row. Millar was, along with Thompson, chosen by Adair to accompany him to this showdown and the pair smuggled a gun in for Adair in case the meeting was to be an ambush (which it was not).Lister & Jordan, p. 317 Adair was expelled from the UDA soon afterwards but stated \\"fuck them 'uns\\" and declared the West Belfast Brigade to be a separate entity.Lister & Jordan, p. 321 Millar and his brother were amongst a small group of C Company members who remained loyal to Adair up to the end.McDonald & Cusack, p. 377 ==Expulsion== The end for Adair came on 5 February 2003 when a fleet of around 100 members of the mainstream UDA descended on the lower Shankill to run Adair's supporters out and bring the West Belfast Brigade back into the fold. Adair himself had been returned to prison following the killing of John Gregg earlier that month.Lister & Jordan, pp. 329‚Äì330 Millar fled the Shankill with Gina Adair, John White and a number of C Company members under a police escort, catching a ferry to Cairnryan.McDonald & Cusack, p. 386 He and Thompson, who was Millar's brother-in-law and with whom Millar had opened a sandwich shop, left immediately before the attack having been tipped off that it was going to happen.The downfall of Mad Dog Adair, part 2 Along with the rest of the group Millar eventually made his way to Bolton where they were housed by friends of Adair in the far right paramilitary group Combat 18.McDonald & Cusack, p. 392 Around this time Millar and Gina Adair, the wife of Johnny Adair, were reported to have rekindled a long-dormant affair, despite Millar's girlfriend Alana Griffiths also being in hiding with him.UDA Mum Sent Packing Millar and Gina Adair were the targets of a machine gun attack on their shared home in 2003.Adair's Wife & Fatboy Lover Escape Revenge Gun Attack This shooting, which claimed no casualties, was later revealed to be the handiwork of C Company member Alan McCullough, who hoped to use the attack to ingratiate himself with the mainstream UDA.\\"Family fears for fate of missing loyalist\\". The Guardian. Rosie Cowan. 2 June 2003. Retrieved 12 May 2011 Whilst in exile Millar and Thompson had a falling out with fellow Company member Gary \\"Smickers\\" Smyth which resulted in Smyth splitting from the group to relocate to Scotland.Adair's Man Setting Up Drugs Empire In August 2006, Millar spoke to Belfast Telegraph reporters denying newspaper claims that he and Thompson were helping rogue C Company member Alan McClean find a house in Bolton adding that he had not seen him since quitting Belfast in February 2003. McClean, his family and supporters had been expelled from Belfast after a stand-off at the Westland Estate with the mainstream UDA the week before Millar gave the interview. Millar also maintained he had severed ties with Adair and begun a new life. > I have a very happy life here in Bolton now. I am working, have a house > sorted and everything was going well until these lies appeared in the paper. > I have closed that chapter in my life now.

Though it was published after The Rise of Silas Lapham, it was written before The Rise of Silas Lapham. The setting for this novel was inspired by a trip Howells had recently taken with his family to Europe. Howells was a realist writer who wanted ‚Äúhis characters to be honest, ordinary people, as he might find in his strata of society, flawed and well-meaning, good-hearted and self-effacing, bound by the conventions and the restrictions of their day but quietly dreaming of a little local heroism in their souls.‚Äù http://litlove.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/on-william-dean-howells/ All of this is encompassed in the character Theodore Colville. ==Plot summary== Theodore Colville is a respected newspaperman in Des Vaches, Indiana. He is the editor of the Democratic-Republican, which he bought from his brother. But after a bad political move his fans criticize him and his pride cannot withstand that. A new opposing newspaper is made and Colville decides to just give up the newspaper business so he sells his newspaper to the new paper. They merge to become the Post Democratic-Republican. Colville decides that he needs to take a long vacation so he travels to Florence. Colville hasn't been in Florence in almost 20 years. At that time he was a young architect ‚Äúwith an inclination toward the literary side of his profession‚Äù.https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8insm10h.htm He travelled all over Italy and in Venice he met a young American girl whom he followed to Florence. In Florence Jenny Wheelwright broke Theodore Colville‚Äôs heart. He was distraught so when his brother wrote to him to come to Des Vaches, Colville happily accepted the offer for a change in scenery. In Des Vaches he got drawn into the newspaper business, which he happily stayed in for 15 years. In Florence he runs into a person he wasn't eager to ever see again: Mrs. Bowen. Mrs. Bowen, whom he once knew as Lina Ridgely, was best friends with Jenny, the girl who broke Colville‚Äôs heart 20 years prior. She is a widow and has a young daughter Effie Bowen. They have a surprisingly pleasant chat and she invites him to a gathering at her home, Palazzo Pinti, that evening. He accepts the invitation. Colville hasn't done much socializing but at the gathering he falls right into it nicely. When he comes in he notices a beautiful, young, blonde girl that's about twenty and asks Mrs. Bowen to introduce him to her. Her name is Imogene Graham and she is staying with Mrs. Bowen that winter. At last Mrs. Bowen takes Colville to meet Miss Graham. She is with a young clergyman, Mr. Morton, whom Mrs. Bowen drags away. Miss Graham and Colville have a pleasant chat. After all the guests leave Colville stays behind to sit with Mrs. Bowen, Miss Graham, and young Effie by the fire. Effie, Mrs. Bowen‚Äôs young daughter, is enchanted with Colville. Before Colville bids the women good night, Mrs. Bowen tells him he is welcome to drop by anytime. On Thursday, the day Mrs. Bowen receives guests, Colville comes by the Palazzo Pinti. Unfortunately, Mrs. Bowen has a headache and won't come down to greet the guests. But after all the guests leave and she hears Colville‚Äôs voice, she does come down to greet him. They invite Colville to a dance party the next night, and he accepts the invitation. The next night, Colville picks up the women to go to Madame Uccelli‚Äôs dance party. Miss Graham is a wonderful dancer and makes Colville dance the Lancers. Unfortunately Colville is awful at Lancers and makes a fool of himself. He doesn't dance for the rest of the night. The next day he runs into Miss Graham and Effie and stops to socialize with them. Effie is enchanted with Colville and Miss Graham finds him very droll. While they converse, Miss Graham begins to develop a crush on Colville and Colville, though he finds her charming and beautiful, cannot help but notice their age gap. Miss Graham talks to Mrs. Bowen about how pleasant Colville is but Mrs. Bowen reminds her that Colville is twice her age. Colville has nicely integrated into society thanks to the Bowens and often attends parties. He has also become good friends with Rev. Mr. Waters whom he met at the first gathering in the Palazzo Pinti. This time is the time of the Carnival and people are dressed in all kinds of custom. Mrs. Bowen doesn't approve of the carnival but believes that Miss Graham should experience it. From then on Colville becomes a common guest of the Bowens and every time he comes over he brings the women flowers and a little gift for Effie. He begins to spoil Effie and he enamors the child. Colville invites the women to the veglione and they accept. They go out shopping for dominos and masks and the saleswoman mistakes Colville to be Effie‚Äôs father but no one feels the need to correct her. At the veglione, Mrs. Bowen does not allow them to dance with any of the unfamiliar people. They run into Mr. Waters who suggest that they can still dance within the group. Colville and Miss Graham dance the waltz. Mrs. Bowen doesn't seem too happy about this. Colville and Miss Graham have a romantic moment as they dance. When they get back to where they left Mrs. Bowen and Effie, the mother and child are nowhere in sight. Miss Graham doesn't mind being left alone with Colville but Colville seems eager to find Mrs. Bowen and Effie. Someone informs them that the child wasn't feeling well so mother and daughter left. Colville and Miss Graham rush home but Effie seems to be doing okay. The next day Colville comes to check on Effie. He apologizes to Mrs. Bowen for his actions the previous night; he should not have left Mrs. Bowen. She forgives him but he doesn't feel like she has truly forgiven him. She leaves and Effie comes and sits on Colville‚Äôs lap and he tells her Florentine fairy tales. When he leaves Mrs. Bowen talks to Miss Graham and tells her that as her surrogate mother for that winter she feels responsible to advice the girl if she becomes interested in man who unintentionally will make her unhappy. They both know she is talking about Colville. Then Mrs. Bowen takes everything she says to Miss Graham back and rushes out of the room. The next day Colville attends a reception in hopes of running into Mrs. Bowen. He searches for her but he only finds Miss Graham. Miss Graham says something insensitive to Colville, which he knows didn't actually come from her but from Mrs. Bowen. She says that he is amusing himself with her. He is disturbed by such an assumption by Mrs. Bowen that he storms out of the reception. He goes to the Palazzo Pinti and confronts Mrs. Bowen and she responds to him truthfully that it was she who had put this idea in the young girls head. She is harsh with Colville. Colville suggests that it must be best if he leaves Florence and she agrees. Colville rushes back to the hotel where he is staying and begins to pack. He plans to take the 7 pm train to Rome. He realizes he doesn't have enough money with him to pay the landlord or the train. It is Saturday afternoon and the banks are closed and won't be open until Monday. Rev. Mr. Waters comes by but unfortunately he doesn't make a habit of carrying money with him so he doesn't have enough to help Colville. Colville must delay his leave until Monday. He goes for a walk and when he comes back there is a letter for him. At the same time Colville is packing to leave, at Palazzo Pinti the women are distressed. Miss Graham is weeping because she thinks Colville leaving is her doing. Mrs. Bowen is also upset because she didn't mean for it to go this far. Finally Mrs. Bowen decides to write Colville a letter stating that there is no need for him to leave and invites him to lunch the following day to put everything behind them. This is the letter Colville receives when he gets back from his walk. He declines the invitation because he truly feels it was best if he left Florence. The next day he decides to visit the Boboli Gardens where he runs into Miss Graham, Effie Bowen, and Mrs. Amsden. Effie holds his hand as he talks with Mrs. Amsden but Miss Graham holds back. When Miss Graham goes to see the flowers alone with Colville she begs him not to go, admits her feelings for him and explains the whole misunderstanding with what Mrs. Bowen had said. They confess their like for each other and Colville decides to stay. Mrs. Bowen is glad Colville is staying but she doesn't seemed pleased with the reason. She becomes cold toward Imogene. Effie is happy that he is staying because she loves him as a father figure. Mrs. Bowen tells Miss Graham that it is her responsibility to write to her mother about Miss Graham‚Äôs engagement with Colville. Imogene tells Colville that even if her family refuses she will keep her promise to stay with him because she loves him. Colville says she is free to do whatever she pleases, that she should not feel bound to him. Miss Graham tries to involve Colville more into the society by making him attend more parties and visit ladies on their days of visitation. This new routine tires Colville and whenever he sits down he falls asleep because the day‚Äôs and night‚Äôs events have worn him out. She also makes him change his clothing to a younger more fashionable look. But Imogene realizes that this lifestyle does not suit Colville and tells him he doesn't need to do it anymore. This also makes Miss Graham realize their age difference again. On their way back from a visit to Fiesole, they get into a wreck. But before the wreck Colville frantically helps get Mrs. Bowen and Effie out of the car. Imogene notices that he helped them before her so she doesn't let him help her. Instead she lets Mr. Morton, the young clergyman, help her off the carriage. Colville tries to control the horse and crashes. Colville wakes up later in a bed. He had a bad crash and has broken bones and his head has been hit. As he drifts in and out of sleep he notices Mrs. Bowen and Effie‚Äôs company but not much of Imogene. Her mother is in town and Imogene is staying with her at the hotel until Colville is well and they can come talk to him. Mrs. Graham informs Colville that her daughter Imogene has realized after the accident that she isn't really in love with him. He understands perfectly because he too realizes he isn't really in love with her either. It is a peaceful break up. Colville is getting used to the comfort of Palazzo Pinti but he knows he must leave before he gets too accustomed to the hospitality. He loves being at the Palazzo Pinti with Mrs. Bowen and Effie, but he knows he must go back to the hotel. While talking to Mr. Waters he realizes that he is in love with Mrs. Bowen and has been since he first arrived in Florence that winter. He goes to see Mrs. Bowen and confesses his love to her. She says she loves him also but refuses his marriage proposal. He suggests that it might be better if he leaves Florence, and she agrees. But before he leaves, Effie arrives, and when she finds out he is leaving, she bursts into tears, so Mrs. Bowen tells him not to go. In June, Mrs. Bowen becomes Mrs. Colville. Effie is happy to have Colville as a stepfather. The family moves to Rome. ==Setting== The story mainly takes place in Florence. The main parts of Florence that are mentioned are the Lung'Arno, Cascine, and the Boboli Gardens. Palazzo Pinti is the Bowens' home in Florence. The idea for the Palazzo Pinti may have come from a real Renaissance palace in Florence, the Palazzo Pitti. Fiesole, a town in the province of Florence, is also mentioned. This is where they have the wreck that makes Miss Graham realize she's not in love with Colville, because he cares more for Mrs. Bowen and Effie. Des Vaches, Indiana is where Colville went to forget his broken heart by focusing on the newspaper business. ==Major characters== Theodore Colville ‚Ä¢ Main character ‚Ä¢ Middle-aged (41) ‚Ä¢ Has an architecture degree ‚Ä¢ Born in Rhode Island ‚Ä¢ Has a wealthy older brother in Des Vaches, Indiana ‚Ä¢ Editor of popular newspaper Democratic-Republican for 15 years ‚Ä¢ In early 20s; had his heart broken in Florence by Jenny Wheelwright ‚Ä¢ Marries Evalina Ridgely and becomes stepfather to Effie Bowen Mrs. Bowen/ Lina Ridgely / Evalina Bowen ‚Ä¢ Was best friends with Jenny Wheelwright ‚Ä¢ Has a young daughter Effie ‚Ä¢ Widow: husband was leading lawyer in her Western City and was in Congress ‚Ä¢ Is in Europe for daughter‚Äôs education ‚Ä¢ Middle-aged but still very beautiful ‚Ä¢ Well respected in Florence society ‚Ä¢ From Columbus, Ohio ‚Ä¢ Lives in Palazzo Pinti in Florence ‚Ä¢ Brunette Imogene Graham ‚Ä¢ Young American woman of about 20 ‚Ä¢ From Buffalo ‚Ä¢ Blonde with dark eyes ‚Ä¢ Very beautiful and intelligent ‚Ä¢ Staying with Mrs. Bowen for the winter Effie Bowen ‚Ä¢ Daughter of Mrs. Bowen ‚Ä¢ About ten years old Rev.

When Miss Graham and Colville begin to develop a romance Mrs. Bowen starts acting coldly toward Miss Graham. Colville unconsciously is always trying to satisfy Mrs. Bowen and Imogene notices this and begins to hate Mrs. Bowen in what seems like an Electra complex. ===Seasons=== The seasons play an important symbolic role in the novel. When Colville was young and in love with Jenny Wheelwright it was fall. But his love begins to die like the trees transitioning from fall to winter. Colville‚Äôs love life follows the pattern of the seasons: ‚ÄúExcept that this had happened in the fall, and now it was early spring, there seemed no change since then; the long years that had elapsed were like a winter between.‚Äù The event in the fall was his romance with Jenny Wheelwright and the same type of romance is happening now with the young Imogene Graham. The winter in between was the time spent in Des Vaches where his only interest was the newspaper business. The romantic part of his life was as dead as the foliage in winter. But in his return to Florence, the women in his life start melting the coldness in his heart, and love begins to blossom again in his life. At the peak of spring, when the flora have matured to full blossom, Colville recognizes his love for Mrs. Bowen and she confesses her love for him. Finally when we arrive at summer, Colville marries Evalina. All the ice has melted and he is finally married to the woman he truly loves. ===Age=== ‚ÄúThis is a novel that is profoundly concerned with the different stages of humankind.‚Äù Through the different characters, Colville is able express parts of himself. With Effie he can be immature and childish, free of all the social constraints of being a grown up. Imogene Graham gives him a taste of the youthful excitement of discovering new things about the world. Mrs. Bowen is part of his midlife crisis; he wants to live out his youthful romance but Mrs. Bowen reminds of him of where he is in life. The wisdom of age is embodied in Rev. Mr. Waters. ==Title== An Indian summer is a brief period of warm weather in autumn, or metaphorically, a brief revival or seeming revival of a waning era. The term originated in the United States, though it is occasionally used in Britain. The equivalent of the term in Italy is ‚ÄòEstate di San Martino‚Äô but this refers to a holiday (which occurs around the same time Indian summers can happen in America), and not to the weather. Howells may have used the phrase to compare the lives of Americans in America and expatriates in Europe. Americans' life in Italy is a holiday, not real, working life. As John Updike wrote: ‚Äú[Henry] James‚Äôs expatriates are seeking and losing their souls abroad; Howells‚Äôs are on holiday.‚Äù ==Critical reception== Howells considered Indian Summer one of his best books and one of the best character studies he had written. ==Publication== ‚Ä¢ Serialized in Harper‚Äôs Monthly from July 1885 through February 1886 ‚Ä¢ Ticknor and company, 1886 ‚Ä¢ Houghton, Mifflin, 1914 ‚Ä¢ Indiana University Press, 1971 ==References * Category:Works by William Dean Howells Category:1886 American novels Category:Novels set in Florence ","title":"Indian Summer (novel)"},{"id":"35834289","text":"Pa√ßram may refer to: *Pa√ßram, Shkod√´r, a settlement in Albania *Fadil Pa√ßrami, Albanian former politician ","title":"Pa√ßram"},{"id":"35834307","text":"The Masonic Hall is a grade II listed building on Monk Street in Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales. It was designed by architect George Vaughan Maddox. The building is believed to mark the site of Monk's Gate, part of the original defences of the town of Monmouth. Before its 1846 conversion to the Masonic Hall, the building served as the Monk Street Theatre. After more than 150 years of housing the Loyal Monmouth Lodge No. 457, the Masonic Hall sustained fire and smoke damage from suspected arson. The Lodge of Freemasons housed in the building is the oldest surviving Masonic Lodge in Monmouthshire. ==Design== The Masonic Hall (pictured) is a 19th-century, grade II listed building on Monk Street in Monmouth. It was designed by George Vaughan Maddox (1802-1864), son of James Maddox, also a Monmouth architect and builder. The Masonic Hall was constructed in 1846. Nine years earlier, the architect had used a similar design for the Monmouth Methodist Church on St James' Street, a grade II* listed building, and one of 24 blue plaque buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. The Masonic Hall has a classical facade and a slate roof. The two-storey building's fa√ßade has five windows, which are asymmetrically positioned, two on the left and three on the right, and features a sixth, tall, round-headed window, which is centrally positioned over the main door. The building's exterior walls are roughcast. The Masonic symbol of square and compasses is visible over each of the two symmetrically positioned side doors. ==Origins== Map of Monmouth by cartographer John Speed illustrates Monk's Gate in 1610. A curved wall to the right of the entrance to the Masonic Hall is thought to indicate the site of a portion of Monk's Gate. The gate, shown on the 1610 map of Monmouth (pictured) by cartographer John Speed, was a component of the Monmouth town walls and defences that were constructed circa 1300. While the gates of the town outlasted the walls themselves, Monk's Gate was removed in 1710. The building on that site in the early 19th century was occupied by the Monk Street Theatre from 1838 to 1844. It was converted to the Masonic Hall by Maddox in 1846, and given a completely new fa√ßade. However, the interior maintains a considerable amount of its original identity as a theatre. In February 2012, BBC News reported that architect Rob Firman had completed a project to visit and document each theatre and performance building in South Wales. He reported that the Monk Street Theatre had been converted to another use, as had been 28 other venues. ==Masonic Lodge== The Province (of Freemasons) of Monmouthshire was established in 1753. One of the earliest Masonic Lodges in Monmouthshire had its meetings at the Crown and Thistle Inn in Monmouth, but that Lodge did not survive. The oldest surviving Masonic Lodge in Monmouthshire is the Loyal Monmouth Lodge No. 457. With a warrant of 21 December 1838, it was established in 1839, originally as Masonic Lodge No. 671. It continues to have its meetings in Monmouth. The building in which it meets, the Masonic Hall, was the first building in Monmouthshire to be used mainly for masonic purposes. In 1923, the secretary of the lodge at the Masonic Hall was George B. Adamson. ==Fire and recovery== In April 2005, an investigation was launched to determine the cause of a fire that resulted in extensive damage to the Masonic Hall on Monk Street and that took half an hour to bring control. It was reported that the entire building sustained smoke damage. The Masonic Hall not only housed the Loyal Monmouth Lodge; for ten years, it also served as the home of the caretaker, who was away on holiday when the fire started. The investigation into the blaze resulted in the arrest of a local man on suspicion of arson. The building continues to be utilized. In September 2011, the Masonic Hall participated in \\"Open Doors 2011, European Heritage Days in Wales.\\" It was promoted as \\"Wales's biggest celebration of architecture and heritage.\\" Locally, the celebration was entitled \\"Open Doors in Monmouth\\" and there was strong participation in Monmouth, with the Masonic Hall one of about 20 buildings welcoming visitors during the weekend of 10-11 September. ==See also== *Monk Street, Monmouth *Monmouth Town Walls and Defences ==References *Website of the Province of Monmouthshire Category:Houses in Monmouth, Wales Category:Masonic buildings in the United Kingdom Category:Freemasonry in Wales ","title":"Masonic Hall, Monmouth"},{"id":"35834334","text":"\\"Unshakeable\\" is an electronic rock single by Celldweller from Wish Upon a Blackstar, it is the second single from the album, and the second Celldweller song to receive airplay (the other being \\"I Believe You\\"), the radio edit was released free through Alternative Presshttp://www.altpress.com/features/entry/premiere_celldweller_unshakeable and SoundCloudhttps://www.facebook.com/celldweller/posts/384702561566409 on May 15, 2012.http://mim.io/3a3582 \\"Unshakeable\\" was later remixed by BT and Seamless, and was released as its own single on October 22, 2013.http://www.fixtstore.com/product/104945/Celldweller--- Unshakeable-%28BT-&-Seamless-Remix%29-%28MP3-Album%29 ==Music video== An animated video, directed by Josh Viola, was announced on October 20, 2012, in an interview concerning the production of The Bane of Yoto.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flU_veeB5Q0 The video was released on December 6, 2013. ==Track listingBT & Seamless Remix=References== Category:2012 singles Category:Celldweller songs Category:2012 songs ","title":"Unshakeable"},{"id":"35834355","text":"Instinct is the second studio album by American deathcore band As Blood Runs Black.

It is located in the Shawnee National Forest of Southern Illinois, near Ozark, Illinois. The camp strives to remain a ‚Äúlast frontier‚Äù of sorts, where participants can experience life away from the plugged in world of today's society, and go back to a time of outdoor living while experiencing nature to the fullest. Camp Ondessonk states their mission to be \\"to provide an environment that inspires physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual growth for individuals and groups through the appreciation and stewardship of nature.\\"Camp Ondessonk http://ondessonk.com/ Camp Ondessonk is accredited by the American Camp Association. ==HistoryOver 50 Years of Camp Tradition=== Beginning in the summer of 1957, Camp St. PhilipCamp Ondessonk. \\"1959-2008.\\" Camp Ondessonk: Celebrating 50 Years of Camp Spirit! N.p.: School Annual Publishing Company, 2009. 11-55. Print. is part of the Diocese of Belleville. Having no facilities of their own, the parish rented out Camp Piasa in Grafton Illinois in 1957 and Camp Vandeventer in Waterloo Illinois in 1958. Each summer, the camps were staffed by seminarians and college students all under the direction of Monsignor John T. Fournie. Camp St. Philip offered participants traditional camp activities such as riflery, archery, swimming, and handicrafts, as well as some unique summer camp activities such as cooking, housekeeping, and axmanship. The camp also offered a camping honor society similar to the one found at Camp Ondessonk today. Campers at St. Philip spent their nights in one of five units; Marquette, LaSalle, LaLande, Brebeuf, and Hennepin. Led by a desire for a permanent location for a Catholic youth camp, Monsignor Robert DeGasperi oversaw the effort to gain leases of the land that would become Camp Ondessonk. Volunteer crews began construction on the new summer camp in spring of 1959 in a race to finish before the scheduled opening on June 28, 1959. The first major building of the camp was established with the pouring of the foundation for the dining hall. Parishes from various parts of Southern Illinois provided funds and volunteer builders. Volunteer tradesmen gave their time on weekends to provide plumbing and carpentry skills. Older high school boys and seminarians volunteered their time during the week. They spent days building cabins with handsaws and evenings in a farmhouse near the camp location. As the first week of June approached, none of the units were complete yet. A week before opening day a bathhouse was built, although it lacked a water heater, and a well was dug to provide fresh water. As children and parents arrived on opening day, volunteers scrambled to finish building the last of the bunks in the cabins. During the first summer of camp in its new location, 481 campers and 52 staff attended over the four-week period that camp ran. As they arrived, campers were placed in one of four of the original units: Brebeuf, Chabanel, Goupil, and LaLande. Because Camp Ondessonk did not yet have a lake for swimming or boating, campers used a section of Ozark Creek now known as ‚ÄúBlue Pool‚Äù for water activities. Archery took place near where Amantacha now sits and riflery was located in the same area it currently resides in over 50 years later. For the first few years of camp, riflery was not offered during girls‚Äô season. The first stables were located on what is now the ‚ÄúBrebeuf Flats‚Äù and consisted of a stable building built by volunteers in one weekend, and a jumbled herd of horses donated to camp. Another activity area, camp crafts, taught campers how to use knives, axes, ropes, and open-fire cooking. There were also nature hikes and wildlife sightings. The first camp infirmary was located on a rock near the back end of the original dining hall. Although the Golden Arrowhead did not make its debut until a few years after Camp Ondessonk's beginning, the very first summer of camp featured the Silver Bearclaw, which was awarded to the unit that earned the most points throughout the week. Other awards were given over the next few years including Tongas and Kachinas. The summers of the early years of camp were split between an all boys‚Äô season and an all girls‚Äô season. It wasn‚Äôt until later that coed sessions were introduced. While the first summer of Camp Ondessonk was only four weeks long, increased demand forced the adding of additional weeks. In 1960 the summer season was extended to four weeks of boys‚Äô camp and three weeks of girls. Two new units were added for the 1960 season, and 1,804 campers attended during the seven-week season. Lake St. Isaac was added in the winter of 1960-1961 giving campers a place for swimming and watercraft activities. The summer of 1962 also saw the addition of activity arrowheads and the Golden Arrowhead. Growth of the camp facilities continued over the next few years including more units (making a total of seven in 1964: Brebeuf, Chabanel, Daniel, Garnier, Goupil, LaLande, and Lalemant), the B.O.Q., and a new infirmary. An agreement was also made in 1964 with the United States Department of Conservation and Forestry giving camp use of the surrounding Shawnee National Forest and expanding the camp acreage to 4,585 acres. By 1965, the summer enrollment reached 4,380 campers with 120 staff members. ‚ÄúPioneer Weeks,‚Äù or two-week sessions were introduced as well as the addition of the Tarzan swing, a diving platform, and a zipline in the same summer. During the summer session, a cabin in Tekakwitha burned down due to a candle left burning by a camper. No one was in the cabin at the time and the other two cabins of the unit were saved. The cabin was a complete loss along with almost all of the camper belongings that had been in it. The campers staying there chose to stick out the rest of the week, with their parents bringing them new clothing and such, and the cabin was later rebuilt. In 1967 Amantacha became the first tree house unit. The trading post building was also constructed the same year allowing it to move out of the small section of the Administration Building it had been previously housed in. In May 1968, Lake Echon was completed giving campers a separate lake for boating and swimming. To connect the units on the east side of the lake to the main area, the Larry Garner Memorial Bridge was constructed spanning a 210-foot stretch. The Covered Bridge was also constructed in 1968 by volunteers from Saint Mary's Parish. That same year also saw the addition of four new shower houses and a roadway around almost all of Lake Echon, which replaced the dirt roads and trails. 1969 brought the addition of female staff during boys‚Äô season and the early 1970s brought the addition of campers and staff from Chicago as well as staff from around the country and international staff members. To help with the expanding number of campers, Ahatsistari and Lalemant which had been tent units were rebuilt in order to accommodate more campers. The all-day exploration was added in 1972 giving campers the chance to explore the land around them. A camp favorite was added in 1975 with the addition of the Friday Marathon. By 1976, Ondessonk was in need of updates and renovations. The Garnier tree houses were built upshore from where the Garnier cabins had sat and the Amantacha bridge was added to replace the various methods of getting campers across Lake Echon. Chabanel was moved to its current location in 1979 and the LaLande cabins were rebuilt into tree houses in 1981. Many of the units adopted their three-sided look in the late 1970s through the mid-1980s based on the inspiration of a Polynesian design discovered on a trip to Walt Disney World. Garnier was the first unit to undergo the changes and after some experimenting the new design was deemed a success. A new barn was added in the pastures in 1983 and a new modern health center was added in 1986. A new registration process was added in 1988, which allowed campers to indicate a unit preference in their applications. By 1989 the units of Teondecoren and Ahatsistari were no longer available to campers as a unit choice. However, they were still used in overbooking situations or for special circumstances. The two units were eventually dismantled due to lack of need for 12 units. Coed sessions were added in 1989 and eventually surpassed the popularity of separate gender seasons. This required some reorganization as a boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô side of the lake was designated, separate bathhouses were issued, and brother/sister units were developed. In 1995, Teondecoren was transformed into a tepee unit located in the upper pastures. This set up did not last long and the tepees later made appearances in Chabanel, Raganeau, the Brebeuf Flats, and even in the remnants of Ahatsistari. Specialty Camps were introduced in the summer of 1992 and would later evolve into the Adventure Camp Programs. In 1996, camp reached a major achievement when it earned accreditation from the American Camp Association. The Blob made its debut in the swimming area in the late 1990s but was later removed for safety reasons. Mini camp was introduced for younger campers in 2000. The new dining hall was opened for the summer of 2003 and a Coed CIT program was added the same summer. Ondessonk achieved accreditation from the Certified Horsemanship Association in 2003 as well. Throughout the early 2000s various camp activities were introduced and different adventure programs were tried for brief periods. 2006 saw the return of ‚ÄúCamp Time‚Äù during which time was set back an hour at Sunday evening dinner and 2008 saw the removal of brother/sister units during coed season. New activities and programs continue to be added as camp evolves with the changing times around it in the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù ===Tommy the Bear=== Camp Ondessonk welcomed possibly the most iconic member of its family in July 1966 when it acquired Tommy the Bear.Tommy the Bear http://02a2ebc.netsolhost.com/site/files/7-09-newsletter.pdf Omar's Bikini Club near East St. Louis advertised a bear for sale after it failed as a dancing attraction. Camp personnel became interested in housing the bear at camp, however, they had no way to transport the bear from its location in Belleville to Ondessonk. Omar Monds agreed to donate the bear if Ondessonk was willing to take it and camp was willing to take the bear if Monds could deliver the bear and get it into the cage that camp had set up. Arriving at camp in the back of a Miller High Life beer truck driven by the bar owner, Omar Monds, the owner of a beer distribution company, Chick Fritz, and one of Mr. Monds employees, Tommy was welcomed to his new home where he would live for the next 28 years. Over the following years, Tommy was fed dog food, candy from campers, and leftovers from staff. Tommy managed to make an escape from the enclosure a time or two, although he always returned later. On July 7, 1981, a camper received a minor wound on his hand when he reached into the cage during feeding time and grabbed at Tommy's ears. The camper was treated by health services at camp, but the wound later became infected. This led to the camper's parents to worry that their son may have contracted rabies from the bear. A court ordered Tommy to be examined for rabies but this could only be accomplished by killing the bear so that his brain tissue could be examined. Tommy's lawyer quickly appealed the decision to a local court which overturned the decision. As Tommy's fate was being decided, campers and staff fought to save him. They set up patrols at night to ensure that authorities could not enter into camp during the night and take him away. County authorities set up their own patrols around the outermost parts of camp to ensure that Tommy was not removed and hidden from authorities by camp neighbors. Finally, after multiple legal proceedings, the injured camper's family dropped the lawsuit thus saving Tommy's life. Tommy, who was then 22 years old, was able to resume his position as a camp icon. After the death of Tommy the Bear in 1994, Yonah the Bear came to camp in December 1995. He was found wandering near Mount Vernon, Illinois and was given the name Yonah, meaning ‚Äúbear spirit‚Äù in Cherokee. Yonah lived in the cage formerly occupied by Tommy, as the camp bear until his death in 2001. ===Symbol of Camp Ondessonk=== The symbol of Camp Ondessonk is a circle with a cross coming out of the top and seven stars surrounding it representing the eight North American Martyrs. The circle represents an ‚ÄòO‚Äô for Ondessonk one of the eight martyrs, Issac Jogues, and for the world. The other seven are represented with stars on the camp symbol. The two stars on the top left represent St. Jean de Br√©beuf and St. Gabriel Lalemant. The star on the top right represents St. Jean de Lalande. The four remaining martyrs and represented with stars on the bottom right, St. Ren√© Goupil, St. Antoine Daniel, St. No√´l Chabanel, and St. Charles Garnier. The cross represents a world dedicated to Christ. It also serves as a reminder of Camp Ondessonk's beginning as a camp only for Catholic children from the Diocese of Belleville through its evolvement to today of being open to children of any religion. ==Namesakes== The name \\"Ondessonk\\" is the Huron word for \\"Bird of Prey.\\" It is the name that the Huron gave to St. Isaac Jogues when he was serving among them as a Jesuit missionary, because of his black robe. Jogues came to this country from France in the early 17th century in an effort to bring the Gospel to the American Indians. He ended up giving his life to this task when he was tortured and later martyred. Several other Jesuit missionaries working among the Huron during this time were martyred as well. These saints and their American Indian companions are honored and remembered at Camp Ondessonk with the camp units, lakes, and major land forms named after them. The North American martyrs are: * St. Isaac Jogues * St. Jean de Br√©beuf * St. No√´l Chabanel * St. Antoine Daniel * St. Charles Garnier * St. Ren√© Goupil * St. Jean de Lalande * St. Gabriel Lalemant Others whom places around camp were named for: * Amantacha, baptized as Louis de Sainte-Foi, was a Huron educated in France under the instruction of Antoine Daniel. He later became a friend and aide of the Jesuit missionaries.Amantacha http://www.biographi.ca/EN/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=16Antoine Daniel http://www.wyandot.org/daniel.htm * Paul Ragueneau, a Jesuit missionary who was a part of the Huron mission and worked under the instruction of Fathers Jean de Br√©beuf and J√©r√¥me Lalemant (uncle to the martyr Gabriel Lalemant) for eight years. The unit of Raganeau uses a slightly different spelling of his name. * St. Kateri Tekakwitha, originally known as Catherine Tekakwitha and informally known as Lily of the Mohawks was an Algonquin and Iroquois Native American woman from New France and an early convert to Roman Catholicism. She was recognized as the first Native American saint in 2012. * Echon, is the name given to Jean de Br√©beuf by the Huron. It means \\"Healing Tree\\", as a representation of how much Br√©beuf helped the Hurons and of the medicines he brought them from Europe. Another interpretation of Echon is \\"he who bears the heavy load\\", as Br√©beuf was massive in stature and carried more than his share when working with the Huron people. Previously existing units namesakes: * Eustace Ahatsistari, honored as the greatest war chief of all the Huron nations, was accompanying Goupil and Couture through enemy territory when the group was captured by the Mohawk Indians.Ahatsistari http://www.leblogdelabergerie.com/articles/Savages.htm Ahatsistari's name possibly means, \\"he who cooks with fire,\\" which was fitting as he was a brutal warrior all the way to the end of his life, when he managed to literally spit fire at the Mohawk Indians who were torturing him.Ahatsistari http://catholicism.org/eustace-ahatsistari-huron-warrior.html * Guillaume Couture, a French missionary who worked with Isaac Jogues among the Huron. He was ambushed and tortured by the Iroquois but later became a part of the Iroquois councils when he impressed his captors with his endurance and continuous dignity throughout his torture. He was the only European to ever obtain such an honorable position. * Joseph Teondechoren, a Huron medicine man later turned missionary. His brother, Joseph Chiwatenhwa, is known as \\"the forgotten martyr\\" or \\"the first Huron martyr.\\"Teondechoren http://www.antoinettebosco.com/joseph/epilogue.htm Teondechoren refused baptism during Joseph Chiwatenhwa's lifetime but quickly converted days after his brother's surprise death and took on the name Joseph in honor of his brother. He carried on Chiwatenhwa's missionary work among the Hurons. At one point he was a part of the missionary group that was captured and tortured by the Iroquois and included Jogues, Couture, and Goupil. The unit of Teondecoren used a slightly different spelling of his name. ==Facilities== Camp Ondessonk is a rustic outdoor camp. It consists of ten units to house campers as well as a variety of program areas. ==Program Areas== * Archery Range * The Barn * Boating Area * Climbing Wall * Chapel * The Grotto * Handicrafts Pavilion * High Ropes Course * Rifle Range * Swimming Area * Woodsmanship ==Units== Each of the units at Camp Ondessonk consist of a group of four or five camper cabins and one staff cabin.Cabins and Units http://ondessonk.com/index.php/about-us/our-site The cabins are rustic style lodging without electricity generally consisting of three-walled structures open on the front. Each unit also has its own water spigot, outhouse, and campfire ring. The units can be sorted into four different categories based on cabin type.Brochure http://ondessonk.com/files/2012%20%20Brochure.pdf The first is tree houses which are structures set off the ground featuring A-frame roofs, three closed sides, and a maze of catwalks connecting all the cabins. Most of the tree houses are set back in the forest. The major exception is the Goupil tree houses which are located on top of a 40-foot cliff and are accessible via a winding 75 step staircase. Next is the Brebeuf cabins which resemble the tree houses but sit on the ground. Chabanel is known as the cave unit as its cabins are tucked under a sandstone amphitheater found in a natural grotto. The cabins in this unit consist of platforms on the ground with bunks and a tin roof. When it rains campers in this unit are able to enjoy a natural waterfall, however, the nature of the unit's location causes campers to experience permanent dampness in all of their gear. The final type of cabins is the Tekakwitha Lodges featuring four-walled A-frame buildings with screened in windows and doors. Whereas most units have a staff member cabin that allows staff to keep an eye on campers from an adjacent location, the Tekakwitha lodges have a small staff room attached to each so staff members are always nearby. This makes Tekakwitha the perfect unit for younger campers or those nervous about their first stay away from home. Shower houses are located near each unit and multiple units share shower house facilities. Each unit is named after one of the North American martyrs or another significant figure to Catholicism. As part of their unique personalities, each unit is represented by a color and spirit animal. The cabins of each unit are also named after songs by a particular musician or group. The units are arranged around Lake Echon with girls on the East side and boys on the West. {  - ! Unit Name !! Unit Type !! Gender* !! Camper Cabins !! Camper Bunks !! Unit color !! Spirit Animal !!

During girls season and boys season all available units are open to all campers regardless of whether the unit is located on the \\"girls\\" or \\"boys\\" side of the lake. ===Other Sleeping Areas=== Camp Ondessonk also has two additional camper sleeping areas. * The BOQ (Boy's Only Quarters) is on the boys side of the lake. It is used to house male CITs and adventure campers. It also provides overflow housing for male staff. The BOQ is the only camper housing that has electricity. * Lakeside is located on the girls side of the lake. It consists of one long bunkhouse style cabin as well as two smaller cabins. It is used to house female CITs and adventure campers. ==Former units== {  - ! Unit Name !! Unit Type !! Unit Color !! Spirit Animal !!

Nickname: Teon (Has a very scary and quite well known ghost story) } * Gender did not apply to these units because there was no coed season of summer camp during the time during which they were around. The first six weeks of camp was for boys and the last six weeks of camp was for girls. Ahatsistari was located on the \\"girls\\" side of the lake and when Teondecoren became a cabin unit it was located on the \\"boys\\" side of the lake, however neither was an official unit when coed sessions were introduced. Couture never had a permanent location in camp on either side of the lake and was more of a \\"floating\\" tent unit used whenever and wherever was necessary. ===Primitive Units=== In 1969, a new type of unit was introduced; the Primitive Units of Teondecoren and Couture. The Primitive Units gave campers a unique experience, away from camp, during which they lived off the land for the week. Teondecoren was located at Pine Lake and consisted of Conestoga wagons of the Old West that had been donated to camp. Later, members of the primitive units built their own tree houses about 13 feet off the ground by lashing wood they gathered to trees. The tree houses were accessible only by rope ladder. Campers in Teondecoren lived off the land, and made the unit a popular visiting spot for other units on the Wednesday night overnight. During the day they would hike around the area and swim in Pine Lake as they learned valuable survival skills. In keeping with the primitive theme of the unit, the girls of the Primitives were known to make their own clothing out of feed sacks from the stables to wear during the week. In 1973, Teondecoren was made into a cabin unit when camp was overbooked for a coming week and the cabins supposedly had to be built by staff the weekend before. The unit of Couture was originally located in lower Pakentuck and was made up of tents. It was later moved to a location near the main area of camp and even to a position along Camp Road for a time. When Couture was no longer a unit the tents were used to expand other units in camp. The Primitive Units were used to accommodate higher volumes of campers as more than 4,000 campers were attending each summer. Members of the primitive units came back into camp to participate in activities such as horsemanship and riflery, as well as the Tuesday and Thursday evening activities. Although the Primitive Units were eventually disbanded, Couture made a return in the mid-1980s due to overbooking. The tent unit was placed off the parking lot in the former Frontier Unit's tent practice area. In order to encourage campers to stay in the temporary unit, they were promised exclusive use of shower house C. This resurrected unit of Couture was only around for one year. ===Pioneer Sessions=== Pioneer sessions were introduced in 1965. Although not technically a unit, the pioneer sessions were unique in that they were two weeks long allowing campers a more in-depth camping experience. During their stay campers were given extra time and opportunities to participate in their favorite activities. The highlight of their stay was an overnight canoe trip to Lake of Egypt. Campers traveled in the back of a stake bed truck to a peninsula of Lake of Egypt, from which they would paddle to another peninsula on the lake to camp out during the night. Campers carried all their food and gear in the canoes with them. The Pioneer sessions were an early experiment for camp with trips away from camp. As Frontier units were later introduced the Pioneer sessions were discontinued. The early 2000s saw a return of two-week sessions in the form of Mega Camp. This allowed campers the chance to stay two weeks and participate in extra activities such as the climbing wall and teams course. Although no such program currently exists, campers may attend as many concurrent sessions as they qualify for according to gender. ===Frontier Units=== The early 1970s brought the addition of the Frontier Units to camp programming. Although they were referred to as units, the Frontier program was actually a separate experience from camp, during which participants traveled to places such as Utah, Colorado, and the Bahamas. The program was open to all high school students and brought in an additional 2000 campers per summer to Ondessonk. Because the trips left from Camp, dorms were built on the north end of the parking lot to house participants the night before leaving on their trips. The very first Frontier trip went to Rocky Mountain National Park. It included side trips to Estes Park, the Trail Ridge Road, and Milner Pass, as well as a trail ride along the Continental Divide. As new administration was brought in and summer programming went through changes, the Frontier units were phased out so only one trip to Utah was left by 1986. In the late 1970s the Silver and Golden Frontier Program was added. Inspired by the original Frontier units, the Silver and Golden Frontier trips catered to adults wishing to travel around the country. The first Silver Frontier trip went to Florida and visited sites like Daytona Beach, St. Augustine, Cape Kennedy, and Disney World. The Golden Frontier trips were slightly different in that they traveled by cruise ship in the Caribbean. They visited four different countries along the way. As they became more popular the trips expanded to include visits to places such as Nashville, TN., Ireland, Rome, and the Holy Land. ==Facility areasDining Hall=== The dining hall is a modern facility that can serve all of camp at one time. The building is heptagonal and has a fireplace in the center. It is located away from main camp, on top of the same hill as the stables. Most meals are served family style. The dining hall is air conditioned, and has windows on all sides to allow for ventilation. It is decorated with art work depicting camp that was created by current and former staff members as well as friends of camp. The dining hall had air conditioning installed for the summer of 2013. ===Health Center=== This Health Center is known as one of the top medical facilities in an ACA accredited summer camp. Stocked with first aid and a wide variety of other medical equipment, covering multiple possible emergencies, this building is equipped and ready for all of the campers, staff, and volunteers Ondessonk hosts throughout the year. Staffed by medical professionals and on call pediatric physicians every day of the summer, there is never a moment without someone who is able to provide help. With it being one of the only places with air conditioning, it is known as an excuse to be the spot to relax and cool down for a bit. ===Old Dining Hall=== An old wooden cafeteria that is no longer used for eating because of its size. It is still used for various reasons including last day breakfast, skit (if it is raining) etc. There is now a bigger dining hall that is used but it is farther from the main area. ===Trading Post=== A store in the main area that sells food and items such as: toiletries, camp gear, camp paraphernalia, soda on certain days, and ice cream/candy. ==Natural areas and all-day hike destinationsPakentuck=== The largest single, free-flowing waterfall in Illinois, and it is conveniently in camp property. It is named after a Boy Scout group from Paducah, Kentucky. ===The Spillway=== Right next to the unit of Garnier. It is where the lake meets a small waterfall. ===Split Rocks=== Rocks that have split to the point when campers are taken through some on their all day hikes. One of the split rocks is Augustin's Agony. Some others are Little Split and Fat Man's Misery. === Hog's Bluff === A large, natural, stone peak jutting high above a lake. It was allegedly used as a trading post for Native Americans. === Bush's Garden === A stream near the spillway. It was popularized by a counselor with the last name Bushong, nickname Bush. === Cannonball Rock === A boulder in a stream that is just high enough to cannonball off of. Surrounded by other areas of stream that are great for catching crawdads and skipping rocks. ==Summer camp programTraditional camp== The original camp program of Ondessonk, traditional camp allows participants to experience all the long-standing activities camp is valued for. The traditional camp session at Camp Ondessonk is known for offering the basic camp experience, but in a more nature enriched way than may be found at other summer camps. During their week-long session campers have the opportunity to try their hand at a variety of activities including archery, riflery, handicrafts, horsemanship, canoeing, kayaking, swimming, and outdoor skills. In the evenings campers are part all-camp activities including campfires, a variation of flashlight tag, an overnight campout, and a Native American ceremony. As part of their camp experience, campers stay in ‚Äúrustic‚Äù units usually consisting of three-walled structures open in the front. The units give campers the chance to bond more closely with their cabin mates as well as the 30 or so other campers in their unit. They also act as families for campers for the week as units attend activities and compete in all-camp activities together. Traditional Camp is open to campers ages 10‚Äì15 and offers sessions in three variations of gender settings. They are co-ed camp, girls camp, and boys camp. * Coed Camp: These sessions feature all the activities of camp, just presented in a coed setting.Traditional Camps http://ondessonk.com/index.php/summer-camp/traditional-camps This allows campers to develop their skills in a real-world setting of coed living. Sleeping quarters in camp and on the overnight are gender specific and campers are supervised by the appropriate staff. * Girls Camp: Referred to as ‚Äúgirls season,‚Äù two weeks of each summer are dedicated to providing a single-gender environment for girls. Participants of girls camp take part in all of the same activities as coed and boys campers. All available units are open to all campers during girls season and all units are staffed by female staff members. * Boys Camp: One week of each summer is ‚Äúboys season‚Äù during which only male campers are in camp. The single-gender environment is meant to encourage campers to grow and enjoy camp without the pressure to perform in front of the opposite gender. Boys camp participants engage in all the activities of coed and girls camp. As with girls camp, all available units are open to all campers during boys season and are staffed by Ondessonk's male staff members. ===Activity Areas=== * Archery: One of the two range activities offered at Ondessonk, archery allows campers to try their hand at shooting a standard recurve bow.Activity Areas http://ondessonk.com/index.php/activity-areas During their time in archery, campers will have the chance to aim for the bulls eye under the guidance of trained range staff following the guidelines of the National Archery Association. * Boating: During their time in boating, campers are given the option of going out on Lake Echon in either a canoe or kayak. Boating staff members instruct campers on proper boat technique and etiquette. Campers are required to wear a life jacket at all times and are supervised by Red Cross Certified Lifeguards during their time on the water. Row boating was an option at one point in time, but was taken away due to lack of interest. * Council: This activity area offers campers a quiet moment in their day during which they receive insight and background on the people who inspired the unique names found around camp. Campers learn about the North American martyrs and the Native Americans they worked with. * Handicrafts: Giving campers the chance to make something they can take home, handicrafts introduces campers to the art of boondoggling, leather stamping, friendship bracelet making, hemp weaving, or tie-dying. Staff members are on hand to assist campers with the various activities. * Horsemanship: Each week campers spend time in the barn where they participate in a short arena lessons before heading out on a one-hour trail ride. Campers are assigned a horse for their ride based on previous experience and size. They are required to wear a helmet at all times while riding as well as being required to wear long pants and closed-toed shoes for riding. If campers choose to do so they may return to the barn during Choose Your Own Adventure for a two-hour trail ride. * Nature/Woodsmanship: Unique in that campers don‚Äôt actually visit the nature area with their units, campers do have the option to participate in the activities there during Choose Your Own Adventure. The main nature activity that units do engage in together is the all-day exploration. On the all-day exploration campers and their units set out after breakfast for a hike through the surrounding Shawnee National Forest. Nature staff lead campers as they discover the natural beauty that surrounds them and aallowscampers to see some of the natural rock formations found in the area. Along the way campers have the opportunity to stop and swim in the streams and lakes they pass as well as partaking in a picnic lunch along the trail. Units return to camp in the late afternoon in time to shower before dinner. For campers that do choose to visit the nature activity area on their own later in the week, skills such as fire- building, shelter building, and orienteering can be studied. * Riflery: The second of the range activities, riflery gives campers the chance to try shooting .22 caliber rifles. In order to assist the campers with their stability while firing the rifles, campers shoot while lying down on mattresses on the ground. Riflery staff instruct campers on proper shooting technique and safety as they load the rifles themselves and shoot at targets. * Swimming: Upon arrival at camp on Sunday, campers take a swim test to judge their swimming abilities. The test involves swimming a length across the swimming area, located in Lake St. Isaac. When campers visit the swimming area with their unit later in the week they have the opportunity to use the slides, Tarzan swing, and zip line. Campers also have the chance to swim in other areas of the Shawnee at different times during the week. In all swimming areas campers are supervised by a Red Cross Certified Lifeguard. ===Evening Activities=== * Mass/Opening Campfire: Sunday evening begins with Mass in the grotto shared by a local priest. The service includes a chance for campers of the Catholic faith to receive communion, and campers of various faiths to receive a blessing if they so choose. As part of Ondessonk's openness to campers of all faiths, the service is focused on song and sharing the faith in that form. Directly after mass opening campfire begins during which the theme of the week is introduced, skits from each activity area are performed by the staff in that area, and classic camp songs are sung. True to its name a large bonfire is lit to help create the atmosphere of the first night campers will spend at camp. * Unit Campfire: Monday night, each unit gathers at their unit fire ring to enjoy a campfire and group bonding time. During the campfire, unit leaders will discuss what will happen during the week and campers learn their unit cheers, roast marshmallows, and bond as a unit. * Tuesday Night Game: Each Tuesday night, all of camp participates in a cross of extreme flashlight tag, hide-and-go-seek, and capture the flag. The game is played after dark and campers are encouraged to dress in all black to blend in with the night. During the game, campers are given a choice of being in three different groups; the walkers, slashies, and hiders. The three groups have different levels of intensity, with walkers being the most tame position, and slashies being the most extreme assignment. * Overnight: Wednesday night sees all of the units head out to spend a night sleeping out under the stars. Each unit is assigned a different spot in the woods or pastures surrounding camp, where they will get to experience nature up close at night. For dinner, campers dress their own burgers which are cooked in the coals of the fire called foil burgers. In the morning, campers return to their units for a cold breakfast delivered to them. * Lodge Ceremony: Thursday night the campers experience the induction ceremony of the Loyal Lodges of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha. This is the honor society of Camp Ondessonk. * Closing Campfire: As Friday brings campers week to an end, they attend the closing campfire. Another large bonfire is lit and each unit presents a skit that campers have prepared. Camp songs accompany the presentation of skits. The campfire acts as one last hurrah for campers as they prepare to say goodbye the following morning. ===Overnight Locations=== * Bush's Garden * Durbin's Barn * Indian Kitchen * Kane Lake * Lower Pastures * Morgan's Field East * Morgan's Field West * Pakentuck * Pepsisawah (Upper Pakentuck) * Phantoms Canyon * Pine Alley * Pine Lake * Timmy's Well * Sycamore Spirits * Vega's Vista ==Mini camp and mini camp explorers== Designed with 8 and 9 year old campers in mind, mini camp is meant to be an introduction to the camp experience. At just three days and three nights long, mini campers are able to get a taste of many of the activities of traditional camp. The mini campers are able to stay in enclosed cabin units, Aonnetta (girls) and Chiwatenwha (boys). Some activities are modified to account for the difference in age of mini campers from traditional campers. Participants of the program stay in one of the units and are accompanied by extra staff members at all times to provide enhanced guidance and companionship for the younger campers. Mini camp explorers is for more adventurous 8 and 9-year-olds who feel capable of spending the entire week at camp. Because of the extended nature of their stay, campers are able to participate in all the activities of traditional camp in a modified form for their age and abilities. Campers spend their nights in either Chiwatenwha or Aonnetta with staff trained to take on the challenges of younger campers experiencing their first week-long sleepaway camp stay. ==Adventure programs== Camp Ondessonk offers specialized programs, referred to as adventure camp, that allow campers to focus on one set of skills in a particular area for an entire week.Adventure Camps http://ondessonk.com/index.php/summer- camp/adventure-camps The main areas of focus are horsemanship, rock climbing, backpacking, mountain biking, and canoeing. The programs take a limited number of campers and provide them with the opportunity to enhance their knowledge and skills of a particular area. Campers are assisted by two or three specially trained staff members. As with traditional campers, all adventure campers are eligible for induction into Lodge. The adventure programs are divided into three levels based on the challenge offered and skill required by each program. Beginner adventures, formerly known as level one, is the first level meant for campers who want to build their skills while still enjoying a traditional camp experience in the evenings. Campers stay in a unit as in traditional camp. No prior experience in the area of focus is required. Beginner adventures include Horse Camp, Rock Camp, and Hike, Bike, Paddle, and Climb. Intermediate adventures, formerly called level two programs, offer a more intense experience and greater challenge to campers. During an intermediate adventure, campers spend more time away from the main area of camp in the natural areas surrounding Ondessonk. Most nights of the program are spent camping out under the stars in the babackcountryIntermediate adventures give participants the chance to receive more advanced instruction and develop their skills to a greater level. Although campers spend most of their time away from main camp, they do return at the end of the week to participate in the all-camp activities on Friday. Intermediate adventure programs include Horse Adventure, Rock Adventure, Mountain Biking Adventure, and Camper vs. Wild. Intermediate adventures do not require prior experience in their field of focus, hohowever,t is recommended. The final level of adventure programs is advanced adventures, formerly known as level three. This level is recommended for only those experienced in the Ondessonk adventure programs. Advanced adventures offer an intense and challenging opportunity to expand on the skills learned in the beginner and intermediate levels. As with intermediate adventures, campers spend most of their time away from main camp building their skills on the trails around camp. There are two advanced adventures offered, Horse Expedition and River Adventure. ===Horse Camp=== This program is designed for participants wanting an enhanced experience in horsemanship while still enjoying many of the all-camp activities of traditional camp. Campers spend their days in the stables learning such things as how to care for and groom their horses, as well as receiving more in-depth instruction in riding skills and general horsemanship. Participants are able to experience longer trail rides than in traditional camp while still utilizing the trails and pastures in the nearby surroundings of camp. Each evening campers return to main camp to participate in the evening activities and stay in one of the units. This is a beginner adventure and is open to campers ages 12‚Äì15. ===Horse Adventure=== One of the longest running adventure programs at Ondessonk, Horse Adventure offers a unique in-depth horsemanship experience for campers wanting an enhanced journey away from the main areas of camp. Although campers do return to main camp at the end of the week to participate in the final all-camp activities, most days and nights are spent on the trail in the back-country. Each evening, campers help to take care of the horses, cook meals, and set up the campsite. As night falls, campers have the opportunity to relax around the campfire before sleeping out under the stars each night. During the program, campers receive instruction and supervision from CHA (Certified Horsemanship Association) certified instructors that help them to not only expand their horsemanshipskills, but also to develop their outdoors skills. This is an intermediate adventure open to campers ages 13‚Äì16. ===Horse Expedition=== Before its retirement, Horse Expedition took campers on a two-week journey that pushed them in their equestrian skills.Horse Expedition http://ondessonk.com/index.php/summer- camp/adventure-camps?start=8 Participants received advanced instruction in horsemanship, horse-packing, trail stewardship, and outdoor living skills as they were led on a backcountry pack trip by experienced Ondessonk wranglers. Campers were able to discover much of the natural beauty of the Shawnee as they rode through the various trails encompassed within the forest. The intense nature of the program mandated prior experience and possible participants must have completed a level one or two equestrian program prior to entering Horse Expedition. This was an advanced adventure open to experienced campers ages 14‚Äì18. ===Rock Camp=== Designed as an introduction to rock climbing, campers learn the basics about climbing knots and safety systems while developing their climbing technique. Participants have the opportunity to try out the high ropes course as well as having the chance to climb multiple sandstone top-rope routes in the Pakentuck area just outside camp. Following the same format as Horse Camp, participants of Rock Camp spend their days climbing but return to main camp in the evening to be a part of the all-camp activities, and to bunk in one of the units. This is a beginner adventure program and is open to campers ages 12‚Äì15. ===Rock Adventure=== Offering a more advanced approach to rock climbing, campers on Rock Adventure take the basic climbing skills covered in Rock Camp and spend more time on the natural sandstone rocks in the area further enhancing their climbing skills. Participants experience the highlights of Southern Illinois rock climbing while taking on progressively more challenging routes. In order to maximize climbing time, campers spend their nights sleeping out under the stars along the shores of one of Camp Ondessonk's various lakes as well as in the Jackson Falls climbing area. Rock Adventure is an intermediate adventure open to campers ages 13‚Äì16. ==Former adventure programsLodge of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha== The Lodges of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha embrace the honor camping society first established during Camp St. Philip in 1957.Camp Ondessonk. \\"Lodge of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha.\\" Camp Ondessonk: Celebrating 50 Years of Camp Spirit! N.p.: School Annual Publishing Company, 2009. 56-63. Print. Induction into Lodge is the greatest honor for any camper. Induction into Lodge is open to campers, staff, and volunteers who demonstrate loyalty and dedication to camp in an exemplary way, and takes place each Thursday night during the summer in the Lodge ceremony. In order to be considered for Lodge, candidates much show these qualities as well as being at least a second year camper or staff member. Participants of both traditional camp and adventure programs are eligible. Members are divided geographically into tribes, which act independently to give back to Ondessonk through fundraisers or service. Members of Lodge may also attend Fall and Spring Lodge Reunions each year. A member of Lodge is signified by a sash they wear, containing a patch of a simplified version of the symbol of Camp Ondessonk. Girls wear a light blue sash and are ‚ÄúFaithful Maidens of the Loyal Lodge of Tekakwitha.‚Äù Boys wear a red sash and are ‚ÄúLoyal Members of the Lodge of Ondessonk.‚Äù Both are more simply referred to as Lodge members. After being absent since the 1970s, the Lodge arrowhead was reestablished in 2007 and can be earned by Lodge members over time through dedication to Lodge. There are also two other honors awarded by the Lodges of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha. The St. John de Brebeuf Award is given to an active or associate member for rendering meritorious service to Camp Ondessonk, the Lodge Honor Society, and the community. The John de LaLande Award is presented to a non-Lodge Member who is part of the Camp Ondessonk staff and feels that they do not meet the proper requirements for membership into the Society but have rendered meritorious service to the Society, Camp Ondessonk, and the community. ===Lodge Camp=== Participants of Lodge Camp are able to enjoy many of the activities of traditional camp while being surrounded by fellow Lodge members. Campers stay in a unit made up of other Lodge members and led by a Lodge Official on staff. As part of their experience Lodge Campers participate in rock climbing at Pakentuck, the High Challenge Course, and an extended horseback ride. They also perform a service project for Camp, exemplifying the overall spirit of Lodge. Campers must be a member of the Loyal Lodge of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha in order to be eligible to attend. The program is open to campers meeting this requirement ages 11‚Äì16. ===Lodge Trips=== Beginning in the mid-1960s, Camp Ondessonk began organizing trips to destinations around the world as a reward for members of the Lodge of Ondessonk and Tekakwitha who sold specific quotas of advertisement space for the annual yearbook. Members were notified by a letter inviting them to participate free-of-charge. The trips took place over the Christmas holidays and went to places like Europe, Africa, and the Bahamas. They were usually 10 to 14 days long. In 1964 the trip left from Miami, Fl., on a yacht and sailed to the Bahama Islands where participants were able to enjoy a Christmas vacation of swimming, beach combing, shopping, and relaxation. The 1971 trip took participants on an Iberian tour through Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. One of the most memorable Lodge trips was in 1968 and went to Italy and Switzerland. This trip included the group attending Christmas Mass with the Pope during which the group was privileged to sit in ambassador seats just 20 feet from the Pope. They also spent New Year's Eve in Venice. The 1970 trip scheduled to tour the Middle East was canceled due to conflict in the region. The trips were eventually discontinued. ==Off-Season programmingReferences== Ondessonk Category:Catholic Church in the United States Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Belleville Ondessonk ","title":"Camp Ondessonk"},{"id":"35834372","text":"Pa√ßram is a settlement in the former Hajmel municipality, Shkod√´r County, northern Albania.

Publisher: Red Wheel Weiser, 2007; , 9781934708859.NYPD AngelsRecognition For Cardillo After Four Decades According to the New York Police Department, the officers were attacked by around 15 to 20 congregants, were beaten, and stripped of their guns. Padilla was then beaten and blackjacked into semi-consciousness while his partner fought off several men who were trying to grab his revolver. With his back to the door, officer Negron suddenly heard shots. Negron turned and saw a man with a gun in his hand who seemed to be getting up from the floor where officer Cardillo now lay shot. During the incident, Officer Cardillo was assaulted, stripped of his firearm and was shot at point-blank range. Negron, managing to free himself from his attackers, drew his revolver and fired three shots. It is not known if the man with the gun was hit; he escaped. Officer Rudy Andre of the 28 Pct. broke the glass on the front metal door and saw the patrolmen inside on their backs. He fired several shots through the broken glass into the hallway which scattered the men who had been assaulting the officers, thus enabling officer Negron to unbolt the double metal door. During the melee, officers Cardillo and Padilla were seriously injured.\\"The Untold Story Behind the Harlem Mosque Shooting\\", by Robert Daley. New York Magazine. June 4, 1973. Mosque representatives maintained that the officers entered with guns drawn and interrupted prayer despite repeated requests to leave their guns outside. During the initial attempt to enter the mosque, police officers, including Cardillo's partner Officer Vito Navarra, claimed that prior to being forced out, they witnessed a man named Louis 17X Dupree standing over the dying Cardillo with a gun in hand. After reinforcements arrived, allowing police to retake the mosque, Dupree and several others were initially arrested at the scene. However, before Dupree could be taken into custody, Louis Farrakhan and Congressman Charles B. Rangel arrived at the scene, threatening a riot if Dupree was not released. The NYPD's chief of detectives, Albert Seedman, was the ranking officer at the scene. He said years afterwards that he called Chief Inspector Michael Codd from the basement and asked for two busloads of police cadets, to be armed only with nightsticks, to keep the peace outside. Codd, Seedman said, refused, hung up and would not take Seedman's subsequent calls. Soon after, more officers arrived on the scene. An angry mob began to form around the police barricade, and began pelting officers with projectiles and calling them \\"pigs.\\" Several high ranking police officials ordered all officers out of the mosque and sent away all white officers. It was hours later before 300‚Äì500 people were able to peacefully exit from the mosque after negotiations. Due to the lower police force and a still angry crowd, police abandoned the scene. A promise was made by Rangel and Farrakhan, according to Seedman, that Dupree and the other suspects would turn themselves in to the 24th police precinct the following day, though none ever did. Rangel denies making such a promise. A new police policy was summarily enacted, identifying the mosque as a \\"sensitive location,\\" thus preventing an investigation into the shooting for two years. Officer Cardillo died six days later at St. Luke's Hospital as a result of his wounds. In a decided break with tradition, neither mayor John V. Lindsay nor the police commissioner at the time, Patrick V. Murphy, attended officer Cardillo's funeral. The 'Detective Thomas' from the original false alarm 10-13 call was never identified. Many of the officers of the NYPD, including Detective Randy Jurgensen who was the Cardillo case's lead detective, believed the fake call to be either a diversion or a trap, possibly set by elements of the Black Liberation Army, which the NYPD blamed for numerous murders of police officers. Others have suggested that the fake call was a pretext call from an FBI informant, intended to spark dissent under the COINTELPRO program. According to Cardillo's family, police investigators failed to follow procedure in investigating the shooting. Due to political pressure, officers in the basement directed by Chief Seedman released a dozen suspects in the shooting without identifying them. The release of the suspects severely hampered the investigation. An unrepentant Farrakhan would later state that the officers \\"charged into our temple like criminals and were treated like criminals.\\" ==Trial== Two years after the shooting, prosecutors brought charges against the mosque school's dean, Louis 17X Dupree, after an informant who witnessed the incident testified against him. Subsequent to the first trial culminating in a hung jury, Dupree was acquitted at the second, largely because ballistic evidence could not be recovered and Dupree's attorneys made the argument that either Cardillo shot himself or that he was shot by another police officer. ==Aftermath== According to Randy Jurgensen and Robert Cea, Dupree, who later changed his name to Khalid Ali, was arrested in North Carolina on narcotics charges. He is currently serving a fifteen-year sentence in Georgia State Penitentiary. In 2012, local police officers proposed to the Manhattan Community Board 10 that part of the street in front of the mosque be renamed after Officer Cardillo. Albert Seedman said he decided to retire that day, as he was walking back to his car and dodging bricks being thrown at him. He claimed at the time that his retirement had nothing to do with the incident. In 2012, however, a year before his death, he admitted that his disgust with Codd's refusal to provide the extra officers was his real reason, and he did not want to say so at the time because \\"I loved the police department so much that I couldn't drag it through the dirt by saying what those bastards did.\\" ==See also== *List of unsolved deaths ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Harlem Mosque incident Category:1972 murders in the United States Category:Harlem Category:Nation of Islam Category:Unsolved murders in the United States Category:April 1972 events in the United States ","title":"1972 Harlem mosque incident"},{"id":"35834397","text":"Dheu i Leht√´ is a settlement in the former Hajmel municipality, Shkod√´r County, northern Albania.

From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies ... by R. C. S. Trahair, page 54 He began his strikebreaking career in New York City, working as a spotter on the Metropolitan Street Railway in Manhattan. His job was to watch conductors to verify that they recorded all the fares they accepted. Bergoff was in the employ of strikebreaker James A. Farley (1874-1913) in 1906, working as the bodyguard to Stanford White, when White was murdered by Harry Kendall Thaw at Madison Square Garden. By selling his diary of the sensational crime to the New York World, Bergoff raised the money to fund the company founded with his brother Leo, the Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters. Strikebreaking & Intimidation: Mercenaries and Masculinity in Twentieth ... by Stephen Harlan Norwood, page 66 The company's early strikebreaking actions were characterized by extreme violence. A 1907 strike of garbage cart drivers resulted in numerous confrontations between strikers and the strikebreakers, even when protected by police escorts. Strikers sometimes pelted the strikebreakers with rocks, bottles, and bricks launched from tenement rooftops.From Blackjacks To Briefcases -- A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 55-56. == Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909 == In 1909, the Pressed Steel Car Company at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania fired forty men, and eight thousand employees representing sixteen nationalities walked out under the banner of the Industrial Workers of the World. The company hired Bergoff's agency, who in turn hired strikebreaking toughs from the Bowery, and shipped vessels filled with unsuspecting immigrant workers directly into the strike zone. Other immigrant strikebreakers were delivered in boxcars, and were not fed during a two-day period. Later they worked, ate, and slept in a barn with two thousand other men. Their meals consisted of cabbage and bread.From Blackjacks To Briefcases -- A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 58-59. At the end of August a gun battle erupted, leaving six dead, six dying, and fifty wounded. Public sympathy began to swing away toward the strikers. There were violent confrontations between strikers and strikebreakers, but also between strikebreakers and guards when terrified workers demanded the right to leave. One Austro-Hungarian immigrant who managed to escape informed his government that workers were being held against their will, resulting in an international incident. In addition to kidnapping, strikebreakers complained of deception, broken promises about wages, and tainted food.From Blackjacks To Briefcases -- A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 59-60. Early in September the company acknowledged defeat and negotiated with the strikers. Twenty-two had died in the strike. But Bergoff's business wasn't hurt by the defeat; he boasted of having as many as ten thousand strikebreakers on his payroll. He was getting paid as much as $2,000,000 per strikebreaking job by large industrial clients.From Blackjacks To Briefcases -- A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 67. Even before the strike was over, and then in more detail in 1911, the strikebreakers appeared before federal panels to describe their own living and working conditions after they were brought to the conflict. Held inside the plant or in boxcars against their will, fleeced, stolen from, physically threatened, and given rotten food, one hearing witness collapsed and was diagnosed with ptomaine poisoning. By August 28, 200 of the strikebreakers had responded by banding together in their own improvised union. They'd quit work and were camping on the nearby banks of the Ohio River in an attempt to collect back wages, naming Chief of Police Farrell of the Coal and Iron Police and Pearl Bergoff's lieutenant Sam Cohen as those most responsible. Lawyer for the strikebreakers was the ambitious William N. McNair, who alleged that this treatment amounted to peonage. (McNair would later serve one term as Mayor of Pittsburgh in 1934.) During these hearings, Bergoff explained that \\"musclemen\\" under his employ would \\"get... any graft that goes on\\", suggesting that was to be expected \\"on every big job.\\" Other testimony indicated that Bergoff's \\"right- hand man\\", described as \\"huge in stature, weighing perhaps 240 pounds\\", surrounded himself with thirty-five guards who intimidated and fleeced the strikebreakers, locking them into a boxcar prison with no sanitation facilities when they defied orders.From Blackjacks To Briefcases -- A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 62. At the death of his former boss James Farley in 1913, Bergoff assumed the self-proclaimed title \\"King of the Strikebreakers\\". In those years he settled in Bayonne, New Jersey, built the biggest office building in the city (which still stands), and sent strikebreakers to the Bayonne refinery strikes of 1915‚Äì1916. == Later career and legacy == Bergoff's business declined around 1923. He went into the land business in Florida, then returned to New Jersey and strikebreaking around 1930 with renewed success. From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies ... by R. C. S. Trahair, page 54 A sympathetic article in the January 1935 Fortune lists a few of the \\"172 strike jobs\\" Bergoff's firm had handled, with notes such as \\"1907, Munson Steamship Line stevedores. First fatality\\" and \\"1910, Philadelphia Rapid Transit, motormen, conductors. Streetcar strikes are most fun; strikebreakers pocket fares.\\" In September 1934, Bergoff was hired in response to a textile workers strike in Georgia and duly took two-hundred men to the South. When Georgia Governor Eugene Talmadge found out that Bergoff and his men were in the state, he had the Georgia National Guard detain and deport them to New York. ^Ray Marshall, Labor in the South, pp. 167-168 In December 1935 Bergoff was the subject of a book-length expos√© by the labor editor of the New York Post, Edward Levinson. The book was called I Break Strikes!. Labor leader Walter Reuther credited this examination of Bergoff's practices as a major impetus to the creation of the La Follette Committee. Labor and Liberty: The La Follette Committee & the New Deal, by Jerold S. Auerbach, pages 49-50 Bergoff's involvement in the violent Remington Rand strike of 1936‚Äì1937 resulted in his program of anti-union activities, the \\"Bergoff Technique\\", being republished and repackaged as the Mohawk Valley formula. From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies ... by R. C. S. Trahair, page 54 It also resulted in the federal indictments of James Rand, Jr. and Bergoff for violation of the 1936 Byrnes Act prohibiting the movement of strikebreakers across state lines. Both men were acquitted on November 18, 1937. But it would be his last major engagement. With his business model outlawed, and his private detective license subsequently revoked by the state of New York, Bergoff retired from public view. He died in 1947. == References == Category:1876 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Labor disputes in the United States Category:Labor detectives Category:People from Bayonne, New Jersey Category:People from Michigan ","title":"Pearl Bergoff"},{"id":"35834497","text":"Fellow of the UK Institution of Engineering and Technology (FIET) is the highest grade of Institution of Engineering and Technology membership, awarded to those who have sustained high levels of achievement, for several years.

Fuller as a collective of African-American writers, artists, historians, educators, intellectuals, community activists, and others. The group was originally known as Committee for the Arts (CFA) which formed in February 1967 on the Southside Chicago. By May 1967 the group became OBAC and included Black intellectuals Hoyt W. Fuller (editor of Negro Digest), the poet Conrad Kent Rivers, and Gerald McWorter (later Abdul Alkalimat),\\"OBAC Writers' Workshop\\", Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History. Encyclopedia.com. OBAC aimed to coordinate artistic support in the struggle for freedom, justice and equality of opportunity for African Americans. The organization had workshops for visual arts, drama, and writing, and produced two publications: a newsletter, Cumbaya, and the magazine Nommo. == Background == As noted in Jonathan Fenderson's book Building the Black Arts Movement: Hoyt Fuller and the Cultural Politics, it was in the winter of 1966, when Hoyt W. Fuller, Gerald McWorter (later Abdul Alkalimat), and Conrad Kent Rivers began meeting and \\"reading books, debating concepts, exchanging ideas\\" at Fullers Lake Meadow apartment at 3001 South Parkway Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. From these meeting the members formed Committee for the Arts (CFA). As recalled by Ann Smith, who would become director of OBAC Drama Workshop, it wasn't until a meeting in her and Duke McNeil's apartment in the fall of 1967 that Jeff Donaldson suggested to the group change its name to Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC). According to Fuller, OBAC, pronounced o-ba-see was meant to \\"echo the yoruba word oba, denoting loyalty and leadership.\\" Some of their initial public gathering were hosted by Margaret Burroughs at the South Side Community Art Center. == OBAC members and governance == Members and governance of OBA-C during its inauguration were: Gerald McWorter, chairman; Hoyt W. Fuller, vice chairman; Joseph R. Simpson, secretary, Ernest (Duke) McNeil, treasurer; Jeff R. Donaldson; George R. Ricks; Donald H. Smith; Ronald C. Dunham; Bennett J. Johnson and Conrad Kent Rivers. All of which were part of the Executive Council. == Founding purpose and mission == As reflected in OBA-C's organizations documents were as follows: * To work toward the ultimate goal of bringing the Black Community indigenous art forms which reflect and clarify the Black Experience in America; * To reflect the richness and depth and variety of Black History and Culture; * To provide the Black Community with a positive self image of itself, its history, its achievements, and its possibility for creativity. ==OBAC Workshops Writers Workshop === Among those associated at various times with the OBAC Writers Workshop are founding member Don L.

OBAC Drama Workshop eventually led to the first black theater in Chicago, Kuumba Theater. === Visual Arts Workshop === In 1967, members of the OBAC's visual arts workshop produced Wall of Respect, a mural dedicated to African-American heroes such as Muhammad Ali, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Malcolm X.Timeline, Perceptions of Black. The artists involved in the mural project included William Walker, Wadsworth Jarrell and Jeff Donaldson, who has written of the collective's determination to produce a \\"collaborative work as a contribution to the community\\".Jeff Donaldson, \\"The Rise, Fall and Legacy of the Wall of Respect Movement\\", in International Review of African American Art, vol. 15, no. 1 (1991), pp. 22‚Äì26. Donaldson went on to found the Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists (COBRA), later renamed the African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists (AfriCOBRA)AfriCOBRA website. in support of Pan-Africanism. == Participating Artists == As noted in the Negro Digest, a key question posed to all its workshop artists was the following: \\"Do you consider yourself a Black Artists, or an American Artists that happens to be black?\\" === Actors and directors === * Bill Eaves * Len Jones * Harold Lee * Clarence Taylor === Artists === * Jeff Donaldson *Wadsworth Jarrell * William Walker === Poets and writers === *Johari Amini *Cecil Brown *D.

McKay can play either as a striker or as a winger. ==Early life== McKay was raised in Barrhead and began his career as a youth player for Kilmarnock, where he spent seven years. He was released by Kilmarnock due to a hip problem which their medical staff feared would cause him long-term problems. McKay was then signed by Rangers in the summer of 2011. He played regularly in their under-19 side at the age of 16 and ended the season as top goalscorer. ==Club careerRangers=== McKay made his first-team debut for Rangers on 13 May 2012, in a 4‚Äì0 win against St Johnstone. On 11 August 2012, he scored Rangers first goal in the club's inaugural game in the Third Division, a 2‚Äì2 draw against Peterhead. On 11 September 2012, McKay pledged his future to Rangers for another five-years. After a great start to the season, his form dropped and as a result he was dropped to the bench with Fraser Aird taking his place. After a few matches on the sidelines, he reclaimed his place in the starting eleven with a stunning performance from the bench against Alloa Athletic, in which he scored two goals in a 7‚Äì0 win. From that point on, McKay established himself as a key player in the team, putting in several excellent performances, including in a 3‚Äì0 win against Elgin City and a 4‚Äì2 win against Montrose, racking up a number of assists in the process. On 27 December 2013, he joined Greenock Morton on a one-month loan deal. As there were no U20 League fixtures until January 2014, this was to give him some much needed game time, with McKay expected to be available for five fixtures in his time at Cappielow. On 28 January 2014, his loan was extended until the end of the season. McKay signed for Scottish Championship club Raith Rovers on 1 September 2014, agreeing a loan move until 1 January 2015. On 31 December 2014, it was announced by Raith Rovers that McKay's loan deal had been extended until the end of 2014‚Äì15 season. The arrival of new Rangers manager Mark Warburton in June 2015 saw McKay appear more frequently in the first team. On 19 August 2015, he scored his first goal for Rangers since November 2012, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Ayr United in the Scottish Challenge Cup. On 15 February 2016, McKay extended his Rangers contract until May 2018. On 17 April 2016, he scored a long-range goal to put Rangers 2‚Äì1 up against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final. After the match finished 2‚Äì2, Rangers went on to win on penalties and progress to the final, with McKay scoring in the penalty shootout. He was named in the PFA Scotland Team of the Year from the Scottish Championship for his performances in the 2015‚Äì16 season. ===Nottingham Forest=== McKay signed a four-year contract with Nottingham Forest on 5 July 2017 for a reported fee of ¬£500,000, linking up with Warburton once again. He was assigned squad number 10. On his d√©but on 4 August 2017, he scored the only goal of the game against Millwall.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40748927 ===Swansea City=== On 31 July 2018, McKay signed a three-year contract with Swansea City, having moved from Nottingham Forest for an undisclosed fee. On 31 January 2020, McKay joined Fleetwood Town on loan until the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season. ==International career== McKay was a youth international, representing the Scotland national team at under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels. McKay received his first call-up to the senior Scotland squad in May 2016, along with Rangers teammate Lee Wallace, for friendlies against Italy and France and made his Scotland debut as an 84th-minute substitute during a 3‚Äì0 defeat to the latter on 4 June 2016. ==Personal life== He is the younger brother of fellow footballer Daniel McKay, and has two other brothers. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Apeearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"7\\"Rangers 2011‚Äì12 Scottish Premier League 1000000010 - 2012‚Äì13 Scottish Third Division 31132403Appearances in Scottish Challenge Cup1414 - 2013‚Äì14 Scottish League One 2000101141 - 2014‚Äì15 Scottish Championship 0000000000 - 2015‚Äì16 Scottish Championship 346623051489 - 2016‚Äì17 Scottish Premiership 3554071colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî466 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !103!!12!!13!!4!!15!!1!!9!!3!!140!!20 - Greenock Morton (loan) 2013‚Äì14 Scottish Championship 183000000183 - Raith Rovers (loan) 2014‚Äì15 Scottish Championship 231210000252 - Nottingham Forest 2017‚Äì18 Championship 2651010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî285 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Swansea City 2018‚Äì19 Championship 3021100colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî313 - 2019‚Äì20 Championship 401030colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî80 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !34!!2!!2!!1!!3!!0!!0!!0!!39!!3 - Fleetwood Town (loan) 2019‚Äì20 League One 8200002Appearances in League One play-offs0102 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !212!!25!!18!!6!!19!!1!!11!!3!!260!!35 } ===International=== {   + Appearances and goals by national team and year - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"2\\"Scotland national team 201610 - !Total!!1!!0 } ==Honours== Rangers *Scottish Third Division: 2012‚Äì13 *Scottish Championship: 2015‚Äì16 *Scottish Challenge Cup: 2015‚Äì16 Individual *Scottish Championship PFA Scotland Team of the Year: 2015‚Äì16 *PFA Scotland Goal of the Season: 2015‚Äì16 ==References * *Rangers F.C. profile Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Paisley, Renfrewshire Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland youth international footballers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Greenock Morton F.C. players Category:Raith Rovers F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Scotland international footballers Category:People from Barrhead Category:People educated at St Luke's High School Category:English Football League players Category:Sportspeople from East Renfrewshire ","title":"Barrie McKay"},{"id":"35835008","text":"The 2012 Western Athletic Conference Baseball Tournament began on May 23 and ended on May 26 or 27.

Smyth was an active member of the West Belfast Brigade of the Ulster Defence Association during the Troubles. He was known by the nickname \\"Smickers\\" throughout his paramilitary career, although he was also sometimes called \\"Chiefo\\". ==Early years== A native of Belfast's Shankill Road, David Lister and Hugh Jordan state that Smyth joined the UDA for the first time around 1980 but left again in 1981 after a disagreement with his superiors. William \\"Bucky\\" McCullough, a leading figure in the West Belfast Brigade, was killed at his Shankill home by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in 1981 and Smyth hatched a plan for shoot up a bus stop on the republican Falls Road in retaliation. When the plan was Vetoed by Smyth's superiors he left the UDA in disgust at what he perceived to be their inaction.Lister & Jordan, p. 152 ==C Company== At a later unspecified date Smyth, who also ran a pet shop on the Shankill Road, rejoined the UDA as a member of C14, a unit of C Company which was active in the lower Shankill. Smyth's reputation as a ruthless operator brought him to the attention of Johnny Adair, a rising star from C8, and the two became close as Adair rapidly ascended the ranks.Lister & Jordan, pp. 151‚Äì152 In 1990 Smyth was made second in command of C Company and thus deputy to Adair.McDonald & Cusack, p. 179 According to Lister & Jordan Smyth was somewhat older than Adair, being described as \\"in his thirties\\" in 1990. However, in 2004 he was described by two separate newspapers as being 38, making him the same age as Adair. In 1990 C Company had come into possession of a rocket-propelled grenade anti-tank weapon and Smyth proved one of the few members of the group to show proficiency with the unusual piece of artillery. As a result, Smyth and fellow C Company member Gary McMaster were chosen on 12 February 1994 to travel to Andersonstown where they fired the weapon at Connolly House, causing extensive damage to the Sinn F√©in headquarters.McDonald & Cusack, p. 254 On 26 October 1993 Smyth was, according to senior UDA sources, one of two gunmen who launched a gun attack on a refuse depot on the nationalist Kennedy Way. Two were killed and five wounded in the attack.Lister & Jordan, pp. 164‚Äì166 He became one of the leading C Company gunmen and was highly prized by Adair, who bought him a car amongst other gifts and took him into HMP Maze in 1994 to show him off to other C Company members who were incarcerated such as \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson and Sam McCrory.Lister & Jordan, p. 208 Smyth's high-profile made him a regular target for Special Branch, who hoped that the older man might be persuaded to turn against the younger guns and they paid a number of visits to his pet shop to offer him bribes in return for becoming an agent. Smyth however refused the offers.Lister & Jordan, p. 198 During this period he was allegedly part of a C Company gang linked to 20 sectarian killings. Smyth's time as C Company's leading gunman came to an end in 1994 when he was arrested whilst on an assignment. Along with Rab Bradshaw and Richard Calderwood, Smyth had been dispatched to kill republican Brian Gillen and the three met in a safe house provided by South Belfast UDA member Glen Esdale, who joined them on the expedition. However, before they could reach their destination the car was intercepted by police, who had been monitoring their activities throughout, and all four were arrested. At this trial in February 1995 Smyth was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit murder and possession of illegal weapons.Lister & Jordan, p. 212 By late 1995 there were no fewer than thirteen C Company members, including Adair, in the Maze.Lister & Jordan, p. 243 ==Return to prominence== Smyth would be released from prison long before his sixteen years were up as part of a post-ceasefire prisoner release scheme in 1998. In late 1997 and early 1998 Smyth, along with Stephen \\"Top Gun\\" McKeag, was behind a spate of deadly attacks launched by C Company under orders from the imprisoned Adair. The attacks were ordered as retaliation for the killing by the INLA of Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader Billy Wright in prison. Adair was seeking to build close links with the hard-line LVF and believed a show of retaliatory strength by Smyth and McKeag would help cement these links.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 295‚Äì296 Smyth regularly accompanied Adair, McKeag and Winkie Dodds to the LVF heartland of Portadown to socialise with leading members of the organisation.Lister & Jordan, p. 287 Smyth emerged as the military leader of the West Belfast Brigade which, although officially on ceasefire, had taken to using the cover name \\"Red Hand Defenders\\" to carry on killing.Lister & Jordan, p. 275 Smyth had a difficult relationship with McKeag, who had come to C Company later than many of those close to Adair, and was somewhat jealous of \\"Top Gun's\\" reputation in wider loyalist circles. In 1999 Smyth, Adair and McKeag attended a loyalist event at the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes on the Corcrain estate in Portadown where McKeag was mobbed by fans from the LVF and on stage was applauded by all except his C Company comrades Adair and Smyth. Smyth continued the resentment a few months later when, as McKeag received a \\"Volunteer of the Year\\" prize at the annual ceremony held at the Diamond Jubilee bar on the Shankill Road, he yelled \\"what about me\\" from the audience.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 3‚Äì4 With Adair in prison and Smyth in temporary command of C Company, McKeag fell out of favour and was soon ordered off the Shankill, ostensibly for becoming involved in fights between women at illegal UDA-run drinking dens on the Shankill.McDonald & Cusack, p. 4 On 19 August 2000 Adair organised a \\"loyalist day of culture\\" on the lower Shankill, inviting the five other UDA brigadiers ‚Äì Jim Gray (East Belfast), John Gregg (South East Antrim), Jackie McDonald (South Belfast), Billy McFarland (Londonderry and North Antrim) and Jimbo Simpson (North Belfast) ‚Äì Ulster Democratic Party politicians John White and Frank McCoubrey and Michael Stone to a festival of loyalist marching bands and a show of strength by the West Belfast Brigade. Around 3 p.m. that day the UDA's marching band passed the Rex Bar, a known stronghold of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) on the mid Shankill, where they unfurled the banner of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), a UVF splinter group that Adair was close to. The LVF man and his supporters were attacked by UVF members although after a brief fight word went down the Shankill and C Company, at the time being led by Smyth, ran up the road to attack the UVF. Although they had by then barricaded themselves inside the Rex Bar a number of UVF members were injured in the attack which Smyth had led from the lower Shankill with the call to arms \\"C Company, fall in ‚Äì up that road, now!\\".Lister & Jordan, pp. 288‚Äì289 Smyth and Mo Courtney soon linked up with the Shoukri brothers, two emerging figures in the North Belfast UDA who backed Adair in his feud with the UVF and one of whom, Andre, Adair would later help take over from Jimbo Simpson as North Belfast Brigadier.Lister & Jordan, p. 309 Smyth was present at the Holy Cross dispute in 2001 when a group of loyalist protesters picketed a Catholic primary school in the loyalist Glenbryn/Upper Ardoyne area close to the republican Ardoyne area. As tension heightened Smyth was arrested and found guilty of making a hoax warning call to the police in which he claimed a car bomb had been left outside the school. Smyth made the call on behalf of the \\"Red Hand Defenders\\", a cover name used by dissident loyalists who actually belonged to various groups.Wood, p. 272 The Royal Ulster Constabulary had placed bugs in several phone boxes around Glenbryn in the hope of making such a discovery.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 359‚Äì360 At this point Smyth had been recognised as leader of C Company but he forfeited the position when he was sent to HMP Maghaberry by then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland John Reid, with command passing to Alan McCullough.McDonald & Cusack, p. 391 ==Post-UDA activity== Smyth was still in prison in February 2003 when Adair's supporters were forced out of the Shankill by the mainstream UDA but, having been warned that he would be killed if he returned to west Belfast, he made his way to join the rest of his former comrades in Bolton when he was released from jail soon afterwards.McDonald & Cusack, p. 397 At this point Smyth was widely known, along with Ian Truesdale, as the C Company member with the strongest personal loyalty to Adair.Lister & Jordan, p. 338 Smyth left Bolton in 2004 after the gang fell apart and instead he, his girlfriend Sharon and their child moved to Scotland, where Sam McCrory already had close links to local loyalists. Smyth's departure from England had been hastened by a falling out he had with Thompson and his brother-in-law James \\"Sham\\" Millar. He briefly returned to Belfast in December 2004 to attend the funeral of his brother Stanley although he was guarded by a heavy police presence throughout his brief stay in the city. In 2009 he was reported by the Daily Record as living in Kilmarnock in a property owned by his friend and convicted tobacco smuggler Tommy Burns. In 2007 the Sunday Life tabloid reported that former supporters of Smyth were behind the formation of the Real Ulster Freedom Fighters, although it was not claimed that Smyth himself was involved in the group. ==References== Notes Bibliography *Lister, David & Jordan, Hugh Mad Dog ‚Äì The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and C Company, Mainstream Publishing, 2004 *McDonald, Henry & Cusack, Jim.

It was published on March 20, 2012 by New Harvest. Dave Eggers selected the book for inclusion in The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2012, and it was a GQ 2012 \\"Book of the Year\\". In 2014 Amitava Kumar included portions of Jeff, One Lonely Guy in his newly released book, A Matter of Rats: A Short Biography of Patna. Kumar previously interviewed Ragsdale and wrote about him in The New York Times. ==Background== In October 2011 Ragsdale posted several fliers around New York City as a social experiment. The fliers stated \\"If anyone wants to talk about anything, call me‚Äù, followed by his phone number. The fliers quickly went viral after images were posted on Reddit, with Ragsdale receiving hundreds of phone calls and texts daily from people from all over the world. Ragsdale collected many of the phone calls and texts into a book project similar to Postsecret. Ragsdale compiled the material into a manuscript, illustrating major themes that appeared most often in the correspondences. Ragsdale weaved personal essays throughout the manuscript to detail and illuminate his relationships, family life, and his forays into the New York stand-up comedy world. ==Reception== Original \\"Jeff, One Lonely Guy\\" flyer created & posted by Jeff Ragsdale in October, 2011 in the Soho district of New York City. Critical reception for Ragsdale's book, Jeff, One Lonely Guy, has been very positive, with Bret Easton Ellis praising Jeff, One Lonely Guy: \\"The symphony of voices here is an overwhelming reading experience. This short book is also a verification of a legitimate new form of narrative; it‚Äôs the definitive document so far of where our medium is heading. I've never read anything like it.\\" Ellis writes on Twitter: \\"The most powerful reading experience I've had in the last year is Jeff, One Lonely Guy by Jeff Ragsdale\\". He continues, \\"What I mean about a new art form: Jeff, One Lonely Guy by Jeff Ragsdale is really the first example of successful post-Empire reportage yet.\\" Dave Eggers writes, \\"I love this‚Äîa great idea, and so deftly put together. A telling mosaic of modern loneliness and almost-connectedness.\\" Poet and critic Nick Flynn asserts: \\"We have crossed over the threshold [with Ragsdale's new collage form], and are now‚Äîstrangely, terrifyingly, beautifully‚Äîin this transformed world.‚Äù Literary critic, JW McCormack, writing for Bookforum, describes it as \\"revolutionary\\". A reviewer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented that individual reader reception would be \\"a matter of personal taste\\" and that \\"[s]ome will be delighted at how well Ragsdale appears to know them. Others may just throw the book across the room in disgust. In the case of the latter, one should probably attempt to finish reading the entire thing first\\". ==Reality show based on flyer== In June 2013 Ragsdale was approached by Hollywood producer David A. Hurwitz (Fear Factor, Million Second Quiz, Bam's Bad Ass Game Show). Hurwitz was interested in developing a television show based on Ragsdale's social experiments and conceptual art projects. In fall 2013 Ragsdale and Hurwitz teamed up, wrote, and shot the pilot for the reality show, Being Noticed. The pilot was shot in Hollywood, Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Malibu, as well as various locations throughout Sherman Oaks. The cast and crew numbered in the dozens and the pilot was shot over the course of several weeks. ==Hotline documentary== Ragsdale stars in the award-winning 2014 documentary feature film, Hotline (2014 film), which The Daily Beast calls \\"brilliant\\". The film is directed by acclaimed MTV producer and director, Tony Shaff. Shaff and his film crew followed Ragsdale around New York City for weeks as Ragsdale worked his \\"Lonely Guy\\" hotline. Hotline premiered in Toronto at Hot Docs in April 2014, where it was an official selection and audience and jury favorite. On August 9, 2014 Hotline won First Prize for Best Feature Documentary at the Rhode Island International Film Festival. On May 9, 2014 the Brooklyn Film Festival announced that Hotline had been selected for inclusion in its prestigious feature film line-up. ==References *Official book website Category:2012 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about crowd psychology ","title":"Jeff, One Lonely Guy"},{"id":"35835079","text":"Lily Auchincloss (n√©e van Ameringen) (April 5, 1922 ‚Äì June 6, 1996) was an American journalist, philanthropist, and art collector. ==Early life== Lily Auchincloss was born in 1922 in Newark, New Jersey.

Ynares Sr. Memorial National High School (also known as CAYSMNHS) is a public high school in Taytay, Rizal. situated at the Rizal Provincial Lot Hilltop, Cabrera Road, KayTikling, Barangay Dolores, Taytay, Rizal. Its mother school is Taytay National High School. The school is now an independent public secondary school. It offers specialized curriculum specifically in English, Science, Mathematics, and ICT. The school is currently rolling out the new K-12 BEC program for students starting the school year 2012‚Äì2013. The school also has been planned to carry out the new SHS program that will start on the school year 2016‚Äì2017 but out of all 3 choices for the new program, they will be implementing the Academics area of the curriculum. ==History== Casimiro A. Ynares Sr. Memorial National High School is situated at the Rizal Provincial lot in Hilltop, Cabrera Road, Kaytikling, Taytay, Rizal. It has a total lot area of 4260 square meters which was donated by the Rizal Provincial Government through Gov. Casimiro Ynares, Jr. In 2002, the original plan was to build a three-storey building with 12 classrooms at Hapay na Mangga across the existing Hapay na Mangga Elementary School with a lot area of 3.5 hectares slope site. However, the project did not materialize due to a landslide that affected many residents in the area. Governor Rebecca Ynares offered instead a provincial lot located between the Rizal Provincial Jail and Provincial PNP Headquarters beside the DepEd Division of Rizal Office as the new site of the school. In 2004, through the initiative of People's Economic Council, the barangay officials of Barangay Dolores headed by former Barangay Captain Magtanggol E. Macabuhay Jr., and the municipal officials of Taytay through the leadership of Mayor George Ricardo R. Gacula, the construction of the four- storey building with 15 rooms started. It was turned over to DepEd Rizal with Dr. Edith A. Doblada, the School's Division Superintendent of the Division of Rizal during that time. Mrs. Cynthia M. Cruz, the principal of Taytay National High School, processed the construction of the building and the opening of classes in June 2005. The school operation started in June 2004 through the supervision of Mrs. Loida Alcantara, the newly installed principal of Taytay National High School. The school was then regarded as an annex school of Taytay National High School catering students from Hapay na Mangga and other places near the school. Mrs. Nenita N. de Leon, department head of Mathematics in TNHS, served as the first officer-in-charge. Six teachers were also borrowed from TNHS: Mrs. Viernalyn M. Nama, Ms. Ma. Theresa Punzalan, Mrs. Elisa Regino, Mrs. Emily Ocampo, Mrs. Mercedes Mendenilla and Mr. Alejandro Jose. On its first year of operation, the school.has a total enrollment of 212 students classified sa Pilot and Regular sections. Later, the school was eventually considered an independent school and named \\"Casimiro A. Ynares Sr. Memorial National High School\\" in honor of Casimiro A. Ynares Sr., the father of the then governor of Rizal, Casimiro Ynares Jr. The first teacher in charge was Mrs. Marlene R. Nepomuceno, a master teacher in Math from Malaya, Pililla, Rizal. In May 2006, Mrs. Gloria C. Roque became the first full-fledged principal of CAYSMNHS. Equipped with a degree in School Management which she earned from a 14-month scholarship program in Cebu City, she introduced different educational innovations in teaching and learning process to increase the students learning performance. On July 17, 2011, Dr. Maribeth R. de Dios, principal of Don Jose Ynares Memorial National High School, assumed office and became the principal of CAYSMNHS after Mrs. Roque. With the vision of making the school as \\"A School of Choice by every Rizale√±os\\", that continued the educational revolution. The school used an enhanced curriculum focused on English, Science, Math, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) subjects. Being a Special Education (SpEd) advocate, she took the initiatives of opening the school's door to students with special needs. The first Special Education class was opened in the school year 2012‚Äì2013 catering the hearing impaired students and students with learning disabilities. On September 16, 2013, Mr. Magno R. Abueme, a master teacher from Francisco P. Felix Memorial National High School, officially took over Dr. de Dios. Being a neophyte in this field, his projects were to improve Dr. de Dios' programs, maintain cleanliness and orderliness, and lessen school-based activities to enhance the academic performance of students. Since 2005, 5 more school buildings were built. A Ynares-type Multi-Purpose covered court was constructed and inaugurated on March 26, 2014. In 2015, CAYSMNHS celebrated its 10th year as an academic institution. ==Principals== {  - ! Name !! Year -  Gloria C. Roque  2006 - 2011 -  Maribeth R. de Dios  2011 - 2013 -  Magno R.

Caribbean Voices was a radio programme broadcast by the BBC World Service from Bush House in London, England, between 1943 and 1958. It is considered \\"the programme in which West Indian literary talents first found their voice, in the early 1950s.\\"Pamela Beshoff, \\"Obituary: John Figueroa\\", The Independent, 11 March 1999. Caribbean Voices nurtured many writers who went on to wider acclaim, including Samuel Selvon, Edward Kamau Brathwaite, V. S. Naipaul, Derek Walcott, John Figueroa, Andrew Salkey, Michael Anthony, Edgar Mittelholzer, Sylvia Wynter, and others. ==History== Caribbean Voices evolved out of the BBC‚Äôs first programme for Caribbean listeners, Calling the West Indies, launched in 1939 to give West Indian soldiers in the British army an opportunity to connect with family at home during the Second World War by reading letters on air to family at home in the Caribbean.\\"About us\\", BBC Caribbean, 31 March 2011 (archived page). Jamaican writer and activist Una Marson was hired in 1941 to work on the original programme, and by the following year she had become the West Indies producer, turning the programme, renamed Caribbean Voices, into a forum where Caribbean writing was broadcast.Montague Kobbe, \\"Una Marson\\" , The Daily Herald, 22 July 2011. When Marson returned to Jamaica in 1946, Henry Swanzy took over as producer, making an \\"indelible mark\\": \\"Under his editorship, Caribbean Voices took the form of a creative workshop around the craft of writing, in which writers were offered encouragement and informed criticism. He made it known that he wanted the programme to be filled with 'authenticity' and 'local colour,' reflecting the diversity of the region.\\"Philip Nanton and Anne Walmsley, \\"Henry Swanzy - Pioneering BBC producer whose literary programmes launched a generation of Caribbean writers\\", Obituary in The Guardian, 20 March 2004. Swanzy left in 1955, and on his departure The Times Literary Supplement wrote: ‚ÄúWest Indian writers freely acknowledge their debt to the BBC for its encouragement, financial and aesthetic. Without that encouragement the birth of a Caribbean literature would have been slower and even more painful than it has been‚Äù.Marina Salandy-Brown, \\"Swanzy meets La Rose\\", Trinidad and Tobago Newsday, 18 April 2013.

A key figure in the BBC's Caribbean Service at the time was Andrew Salkey as presenter; his programmes \\"became a glittering showcase for a generation of writers, including Sam Selvon and George Lamming, who had made London their second home.

John Henslow designed the small sloops for coastal patrol duties off Newfoundland. Their role was \\"to protect the fisheries and inquiring into abuses.\\" The vessels would sit in the harbour of St Johns over the winter, and then in the spring would be fitted out to visit the ports on the station as soon as the ice had melted. Jahleel Brenton, who would command Trepassey in 1793, provides an interesting description of her and her sister ship. They were, he said, \\"‚Ä¶facetiously termed by naval men, a machine for making officers.\\"Raikes (1846), pp.50-51. The vessels initially served in this role through the regular rotation of commanders. Each year the Admiralty would place one lieutenant in command of one of them, and the admiral of the station would appoint the lieutenant commanding the other. The outgoing lieutenants would at the end of the year, or at least just before the admiral of the station left for the winter, go through a nominal invaliding. The Admiralty and the admiral would then appoint their successors from \\"the cockpit of the Admirals ship.\\" Of the eight peacetime (1789-1793) commanders, at least five went on to have distinguished careers: *Sir Jahleel Brenton, 1st Baronet *Sir Peter Halkett, 6th Baronet *Honourable Charles Herbert *Sir Charles Rowley, 1st Baronet *Admiral Alexander Shippard Each vessel‚Äôs crew consisted of a commander, a pilot, and five men. The pilot performed the functions of every class of officer below the commander. In 1792 or so, the Admiralty augmented each vessel‚Äôs establishment with two midshipmen. Placentia was lost before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Trepassey served into the Napoleonic Wars, but was too small and weakly armed to serve a major naval role. The Placentia-class sloops were even more puny than the much-maligned Ballahou and Cuckoo-class schooners of the Napoleonic period. ==Ships== {  - ! Name !! Builder !! Begun !! Launched !!

It was released June 8, 2011 for iOS devices. It is unique in that a new level has been introduced each day since its release, and will continue to be until 1,000 days are reached. Online leaderboards for the newest level are open for 24 hours, after which time they are closed. The game received generally positive reviews. Aggregate website Metacritic reports an aggregate score of 74/100, with the majority of individual review scores a 70/100 ratio or higher. Critics praised the concept of a new playable level each day, citing that it inspired competition within the game. ==Gameplay== 1000 Heroz is a platform game that features a new level each day for 1,000 days after its release. 1000 Heroz is a physics-based puzzle-platform game. The goal in each level is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible; faster times yield better rewards. The game's physics are exaggerated, creating a feeling of lowered gravity. It is unique in that every day since its release to 1,000 days since release a new hero and level are introduced. Each previous level and hero remain playable after their initial introduction. Levels are designed to be short and can take less than 30 seconds to complete. Custom Leagues are provided to allow players to create a network of friends to compete with. Leaderboards are included to encourage competition both between friends and worldwide. ==Development and marketing== 1000 Heroz was unveiled by developer RedLynx for the iOS platform on March 31, 2011. \\"We've designed 1000 Heroz to last for a thousand days, so whether you play every day or play only occasionally, there's always something new for you,\\" stated RedLynx Creative Director Antti Ilvessuo. \\"It's a new idea, where you can get your daily dose of Heroz right from the start.\\" The game was released on June 8, 2011. Developer RedLynx explained that only one week later the game had hit one million restarts. Each restart represents another attempt to play a level. \\"Over 1 million restarts in such a short time -- for a new kind of game like this -- is remarkable,\\" said Tero Virtala, CEO of RedLynx. On August 26, 2011 an update was released for the game. Support for multiple custom friend leagues, new gameplay elements, faster characters and other features were introduced. It became free to play on November 22, 2011. In early 2012 a man used the game to propose to his then girlfriend. They played the game together daily. He contacted the developer to ask whether they could include a banner at a finish line to pop the question. RedLynx accepted the request and on January 12, 2012 the level including the banner became active in the game. \\"It took about five seconds for it to hit her and then she was in tears and just asking 'How?'\\" stated the man. The story received media attention from media outlets such as Pocket Gamer, Metro and Kotaku. ==Reception== 1000 Heroz received above average reviews from critics. The game holds an aggregate score of 74/100 at Metacritic. Of the nine reviews listed, six were 75% or higher, while the remaining three were 60% or higher. The highest score was that of a 90% approval rating from AppSmile's reviewer, while the lowest of 60% approval came from Edges reviewer. The critic from Edge magazine felt that while the game was a solid platformer, it did not \\"feel like something [consumers would] be playing in a month, never mind three years.\\" The game was compared to RedLynx's popular Trials franchise. The reviewer felt that while the touchscreen controls were strong, the game did not have the lasting appeal that the Trials games do. Keith Andrew, Deputy Editor of Pocket Gamer, disagreed. He noted that the \\"1000 Herozs series of daily races [makes the game] undoubtedly hard to put down\\". Andrew also explained that the game requires elements of strategy to reach the top scores on the global leaderboards, creating replay value. AppSmile's reviewer praised the game's cartoon art style and its simple, responsive controls. The reviewer criticized the fact that players could not go back to previous levels and improve their global leaderboard times. Touch Arcade's Nissa Campbell explained that levels take little time to complete, and that the short time may actually entice players to play each day and compete for high scores. Jason D'Aprile of Slide to Play gave high marks for level design, calling it \\"clever.\\" He cited multiple paths to the finish, various obstacles and objects such as springboards as items that led to the strong design. D'Aprile stated that 1000 Heroz was a \\"quick, cheap gaming fix on the go\\". ==References * Category:2011 video games Category:IOS games Category:IOS-only games Category:Platform games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in Finland Category:RedLynx games ","title":"1000 Heroz"},{"id":"35835420","text":"Dance Without Music is the second studio album by British musicians Paul Downes and Phil Beer, and their first under the shorter name of \\"Downes & Beer\\", released as a standard 33 rpm 10-track stereo vinyl in 1976 only.https://www.vinyltap.co.uk/shop/item/1237155630126.aspx Colin Wilson contributes to the album.

It was a house built in the early 20th century when Colonia Roma was a new neighborhood for the wealthy leaving the historic center of Mexico City. In the 1990s, the house was restored to open as a cultural center in 1994, with the aim of making the area a center for the visual arts. Today, it hosts numerous exhibits as well as offering classes, even degrees, in art and literature. ==History== Casa Lamm was a project to rehabilitate one of the old mansions which was supported by local authorities. The house was originally constructed as part of Colonia Roma, which was a development in the late 19th and early 20th century on a former horse farm owned by Pedro Lascurain. While Lascurain was part of the project initially, Lewis Lamm took over in 1914, building houses for the wealthy moving out of the city center. The house itself was finished in 1911 situation on Alvaro Obregon Street #99 where it still stands. Like others built during this time, the architecture broke with that of the colonial period, heavily influenced by European, especially French, trends of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It initially was meant to be the residence of Lewis Lamm and his family, but he never lived there. He rented the property to the Marists, it became the Colegio Franc√©s Jalisco, a school for boys. During the Cristero War, Lamm asked for the return of his property. He received it but in poor condition. Upon Lamm‚Äôs death in 1939, his widow sold the property to the Garc√≠a Collantes family who kept it until 1990, keeping the house from being demolished like many of the Colonia in the latter 20th century for redevelopment. In 1993, restoration work on the house began although much of the house‚Äôs original elements were lost due to time and neglect. When restoration work was finished, it became the Casa Lamm Cultural Center in 1994. When the Center opened there was no bookstore, or galleries and the workshops will still in progress. Beatriz Espejo inaugurated the space dedicated to literature, which as hosted names such as Guillermo Arreola, √Ålvaro Mutis and Octavio Paz . It was part of a larger project to make Colonia Roma a center for the visual arts in Mexico and attract more galleries, artists and others to set up shop here. The ongoing project has had mixed success. It has attracted the participation of entities such as the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, the Universidad de la Comunicaci√≥n, Jomart, the Universidad Interamericana de M√©xico and the Casa de Francia, and various galleries have has full and profitable shows. However, security problems and lack of maintenance of public areas in the colonia by the city government have sometimes made it difficult to attract or keep artists and institutions. ==Facilities== Courtyard inside Casa Lamm The institute consists of art exhibition space and management, some graduate level programs in the fine arts and a restaurant and bookstore, which are open to the public. Since it opened, it has hosted numerous art exhibitions. The art exhibitions are held in the various galleries that are in the building. There is a committee which chooses the artists to exhibit which includes known names as well as new talents. In 2010, the Center held over fifteen exhibitions related to painting, photography and other disciplines, including those by Jacinto de Mar√≠n, and Francisco Toledo . In 1999, it received custody of Televisa‚Äôs large art collection, which was formerly housed in the Centro de Arte Contemporaneo in Polanco. The main challenge in accepting the collection was to build adequate facilities for its preservation. One of the downstairs galleries was converted for the purpose. The space contains four areas: the vault (which is fifty cm off the floor to control humidity), a research and consultation room for experts, one for the general public and a space for exhibitions of pieces selected on a rotating basis. The walls of the vault are isolated from those of the room which contains controls for temperature and humidity. The collection contains 2,294 images that Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo collected over twenty years. It contains works by pioneers such as Charles Gerard, William Henry Fox Talbot, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Kati Horna, Karl Blossfeldt, Man Ray, Guillermo Kahlo, Edward Weston, Tina Modotti, Graciela Iturbide, Pablo Ortiz Monasterio and Rafael Doniz as well as by Alvarez Bravo himself. The entire collection has also been digitalized. On the ground floor of the building, facing the street are the bookstore and restaurant. The Liberia Pegaso bookstore contains large selections in English and Spanish, especially in art-related books, but there are also books on literature, history and poetry. The Las Flores del Mal restaurant was last remodeled in 2003, and is considered to be a very fashionable place to eat. Most of the dining area is centered on an open-air patio accented by a black fountain. Many of the restaurant‚Äôs patrons are those dedicated to the arts and media. It can also be rented for special events. It has a wide variety wines from various countries but the menu is not extensive containing international cuisine with Mexican touches such as huitlacoche, epazote and tamarind. The center offers bachelor‚Äôs in art history, as well as masters in art, art appreciation and literary creation and a doctorate in art history. The bachelor‚Äôs is offered in conjunction with Secretariat of Public Education . It also offers courses, certificate programs, seminars and workshops in various disciplines such as art history, Mexican history, archeology, painting, sculpture, philosophy, music and cinema. It also contains an art library with almost 12,000 volumes, just over 680 videos. ==References== Category:Cultural centers in Mexico Category:Colonia Roma Category:Arts in Mexico City Category:Houses in Mexico City Category:Museums in Mexico City Category:20th- century architecture in Mexico Category:Neoclassical architecture in Mexico ","title":"Casa Lamm"},{"id":"35835476","text":"Yugul or Yukul (Yukul) is an extinct Australian Aboriginal language of the Marran family.Bowern, Claire. 2011. \\"How Many Languages Were Spoken in Australia?\\", Anggarrgoon: Australian languages on the web, December 23, 2011 (corrected February 6, 2012) The name \\"Yugul\\" has been used in various ways by people of Ngukurr, where this language may have been spoken, including as a cover term for languages of the area.

She was one of thirteen similar vessels, known to Sydney siders as the 'Hollywood Fleet'. Sea Mist is a 65 ft cruiser built by Lars Halvorsen and Sons and launched on 14 August 1939. Whilst some reports indicate she was built for Oliver Triggs, the founder of Meadow Lea, or for motor racing identity Hope Bartlett, she was in fact built for Mr and Mrs Gale of Potts Point. She was the second Sea Mist for the Gales. She was subsequently purchased by Hope Bartlett before she was requisitioned by the Navy. Sea Mist was commissioned by the RAN on 21 July 1941 as HMAS Seamist, (The first Sea Mist was also acquired by the RAN and later sold to the USN as Sea Mist) under the command of Sub-Lieutenant John A Doyle RANR(S). During the Battle of Sydney Harbour (often referred to as the Attack on Sydney Harbour) by the Imperial Japanese Navy on 31 May and 1 June 1942, Seamist, at approx. 5.00am whilst patrolling between Bradleys Head and the boom net, investigated an object in Taylors Bay. On realising it was the conning tower of the midget submarine (M-21), her commender Reg Andrew bought Seamist to the place where the submarine had just submerged and dropped a depth charge. The blast inverted and blew the submarine to the surface. Seamist returned and dropped a second depth charge, so close that Andrew later said he could have stepped on to the inverted hull of the submarine. The second blast, however, lifted one of Seamist's engines off its mountings and she had to retire. Her sister ships of the Hollywood Fleet, HMAS Steady Hour and HMAS Yarroma, continued the search and on obtaining a 'contact' at approx. 6.40am, dropped further depth charges. Credit for the destruction of the submarine was given to HMAS Steady Hour and HMAS Yarroma, however subsequent investigations identified it was Seamist's decisive attack that caught the submarine and effectively destroyed her. In March 1944 Seamist was transferred to the Naval Auxiliary Patrol unit of the RAN, and following a refit in Sydney, she was assigned as an Air Sea Rescue vessel for duty at Darwin. On arrival, Seamist was allotted to Melville Bay for air-sea rescue duties, 650 km to the east from where she had just sailed. On 26 February 1945, with Steady Hour and the former three-masted coastal trader Alma Doepel, she departed Darwin for Thursday Island and Townsville for a refit. On 3 March 1945, she was at Melville Bay when Steady Hour was destroyed by fire whilst refueling. Seamist arrived at Brisbane on 20 May 1945 for her ‚Äògeneral refit‚Äô and by September, with no further naval commitment for her, she was directed to Sydney. She departed under tow by HMAS Koala and arrived in Sydney on 8 October 1945. She was ‚Äòpaid off‚Äô on 9 November 1945 for disposal. Seamist was re-purchased by Hope Bartlett, and was later owned by a succession owners, including the legendary radio broadcaster Jack Davey. Today (2020) she remains afloat and in use. HMAS Seamist was awarded Battle Honours, \\"Pacific 1942\\" for her role during the Battle of Sydney Harbour. ==NotesReferences== *Blunt, William; Lolita and the Hollywood Fleet, First Edition, May 2020. * Category:Patrol vessels of the Royal Australian Navy Category:1939 ships ","title":"HMAS Sea Mist"},{"id":"35835518","text":"Hajrudin \\"≈†iba\\" Krvavac (22 December 1926 ‚Äì 11 July 1992) was a Bosnian film director most notable for directing movies from the Partisan film genre during 1960s and 70s. His gift for precise storytelling was visible in his early documentaries and would become a staple of his feature films later on. Starting with his directorial debut, the segment Otac (Father) of the anthology film Vrtlog (Vortex, 1964), all his feature films are action films set in World War II. Their storytelling owes a lot to comic books and American action films, especially westerns, with an imaginative combination of action and emotions, personal drama and epic tragedy, idealised heroism and psychological trials, sometimes with a dose of humor. Because of the style of his films, Krvavac was sometimes compared to Howard Hawks. ==Early life and career== Hajrudin Krvavac was born in the Mejta≈° neighborhood of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina on 22 December 1926. His parents, both originally from Gacko, were Muslims and ethnic Bosniaks. Krvavac had a brother Sabahudin. As a teenager in Sarajevo, Krvavac assisted the Partisan resistance on the outskirts of the city that like the rest of Bosnia had since April 1941 been occupied by the newly created Nazi German puppet entity Independent State of Croatia ‚Äî the youngster reportedly made treks out of the city on four separate occasions in order to take part in actions organized by local resistance leader Valter Periƒá. As the World War II ended and Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia got established, Krvavac moved to Belgrade for college (vi≈°a ≈°kola) studies, enrolling in a diplomacy and journalism program. Upon returning to Sarajevo, on suggestion from his friend Eli Finci, Krvavac decided to pursue film direction despite possessing no formal training. During early 1950s he got jailed by Yugoslav authorities on Goli otok, a political prison for Soviet-leaning Yugoslav communists following the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split and the subsequent Informbiro period. === Partisan film === Hajrudin Krvavac was one of the leading film directors of the Partisan Film genre during the 1960s and 1970s. Krvavac is most well known for his trilogy of Partisan Films, which exemplified the communist government‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúbrotherhood and unity‚Äù (bratstvo i jedinstvo). The trilogy depicted the Yugoslav Partisan struggle against the Nazi fascist forces during Second World War. The three films of Krvavac‚Äôs trilogy consist of: Diverzanti (\\"The Demolition Squad\\"), 1967; Most (\\"The Bridge\\"), 1969; and his masterpiece, Valter brani Sarajevo (\\"Walter Defends Sarajevo\\"), 1972.Dina Iordanova, The Cinema of the Balkans, (London: Wallflower Press, 2006). However, Krvavac was most well known for incorporating American Western film elements into his Partisan films. For example, Krvavac‚Äôs Most, has been compared to Western classics like The Dirty Dozen and The Bridge on the River Kwai.Radina Vuƒçetiƒá, ‚ÄúKauboji u Partizanskoj Uniformi: Ameriƒçki versterni i partizanski versterni u Jugoslaviji ≈°ezdestih godina 20. veka,‚Äù Tokovi Istorije, Fevurari 2010. Krvavac‚Äôs trilogy was designed to both ‚Äúrelax and influence the mind,‚Äù of the audience as many American movies during the same time period aspired to do. Moreover, many film analysts have compared the main character of Walter Defends Sarajevo to that of James Bond, where in scenes Walter is jumping from train to train and eluding Nazi capture. Most importantly, Krvavac‚Äôs films were created to be appropriate for audiences of all ages, in order to display the Partisan unity to all of Yugoslavia. This universality that Krvavac used was especially evident when he won the ‚ÄúAudience‚Äôs Award‚Äù at the 1967 Pula film festival for his film, Diverzanti. Hajrudin Krvavac was influential in creating the unique subgenre of Partisan film, \\"Red Western\\" (crveni vestern).Nevana Dakoviƒá, ‚ÄúCinema Komunisto i Post-Komunisto: Filmski tekst pamƒáenja, seƒáanja, i nostalgije,‚Äù Univerzitet umetnosti u Beograd, pg. 15. The ‚ÄúRed Western‚Äù genre contained many great masterpieces, such as Bitka na Neretvi, by Veljko Bulajiƒá, which was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 1969. Hajrudin Krvavac‚Äôs work influenced many other Yugoslav directors at the time, and together they helped create some of the greatest works of cinema to emerge from the former Yugoslav states. ==Selected filmography== *Vrtlog (1964) *Diverzanti (1967) *Most (1969) *Valter brani Sarajevo (1972) *Partizanska eskadrila (1979) ==Death== Krvavac died in July 1992 during the early months of the Siege of Sarajevo. When the Bosnian War started he was offered by Serbian actors Bata ≈Ωivojinoviƒá and Ljubi≈°a Samard≈æiƒá to be taken out of Sarajevo to Serbia, which he rejected, and ultimately succumbed to a heart condition during the Siege of Sarajevo. However, Krvavac lived long enough to see the people of Sarajevo in 1992 chant, ‚ÄúWe Are Walter!‚Äù in protest of the conflict. In Walter Brani Sarajevo, the German officer who is trying to capture Walter, concludes that Walter is not just one individual, but a united front which was the whole city of Sarajevo. ==Notes== * Yugoslavian Film Encyclopedia, Yugoslavian Lexicographic Institute \\"Miroslav Krle≈æa\\", 1986‚Äì1990 ==References * Category:1926 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from Sarajevo Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina film directors Category:German-language film directors Category:Yugoslav film directors ","title":"Hajrudin Krvavac"},{"id":"35835530","text":"Live in Concept is the first live album by Downes and Beer, released in 1980.

Wilkins Freeman. It is set in the small town of Pembroke, Massachusetts in the 1830s and 40s. The novel tells the story of a romance gone awry and the dramatic events that follow, which entertain the residents of the small town for years after. As one of Freeman's first novels, Pembroke experienced great success in its time and, although it has only recently experienced a comeback in the academic sphere, it is known for being an exemplary piece of New England local color fiction.Freeman ==Plot summary== The novel begins with the breaking off of the engagement between Barney Thayer and Charlotte Barnard after Charlotte's father and Barney get into a heated political argument. The breaking of their engagement is central to the story, as it happens in the beginning of the novel and sets the stage for the novel's later events. Upon ending their engagement, Barney moves into the house that was intended to be the home of him and Charlotte after their wedding. Many members of Barney's family and Charlotte's attempt to appeal to Barney to make him return to Charlotte and fix their engagement, but in his mind there is no alternative to the way things are and there is sense in him trying to return to Charlotte. Thus, Barney continues to live in the unfinished house alone. Although Charlotte has the opportunity to marry Thomas Payne, a wealthy and worthy member of her town, she declines his offer, stating that she is not in love with him and could only ever marry Barney. Charlotte continues to live in her parents home, taking on work as a seamstress and assistance at weddings. Other courtships are revealed throughout the novel, including that of Sylvia Crane and Richard Alger, Rebecca Thayer and William Berry, and Rose Berry and Tommy Ray. Sylvia Crane, Charlotte's aunt, is involved in a long-term courtship with Richard Alger that provides a source of wonder to the townspeople. No one seems to know the details of their relationship, and even Sylvia and Richard do not seem to know where they are trying to go. At one point, Richard tells Sylvia that they should not see each other anymore and stops visiting her, which breaks Sylvia's heart. This continues for a few years, until Richard witnesses Sylvia being taken to the poorhouse. Richard finally takes control of the situation, returns Sylvia to her home, and promises to make up for the bad ways he has treated her. Sylvia and Richard are then married and are essentially given a \\"happily-ever-after\\" ending. Rebecca Thayer, Barney's sister, and William Berry have a scandalous affair. Despite being forbidden by her mother to see William, who is Charlotte's cousin, Rebecca proceeds to have a several-month-long courtship with William that entails her sneaking out of the house on several occasions to see him. Although the whole town is aware of this, no one says a word to either of Rebecca's parents, who remain oblivious. Deborah eventually becomes aware of what her daughter has been up to when she is making a dress for Rebecca and notices her swollen belly, recognizing that she is pregnant. Deborah kicks Rebecca out in the middle of a terrible snowstorm. Later that night, Deborah goes to Barney and commands him to find William and make him marry Rebecca. Barney and William eventually find Rebecca at the home of the town recluse, where Rebecca and William are married by the minister. At this point though, there is no longer any love between Rebecca and William, which results in their withdrawal from the town. After Charlotte and Barney's engagement ends, Rose Berry begins to show interest in Barney. This is quickly put to an end when Charlotte becomes aware of what her cousin is up to and Barney begins to avoid Rose. Rose quickly moves on to Tommy Ray, despite the fact that she knows he is not a good match and she thinks of him as still a boy. Nonetheless, after several months of courtship Rose and Tommy are married, providing the only example of a typical courtship in the novel. These are not the only important events that add to the drama occurring in Pembroke at the time. Silas Berry, the father of Rose and William, further ostracizes himself through his greed when he offers to let his children have a party at his cherry orchard for all the young people of Pembroke. The party ensues happily, but as the guests are leaving, Silas approaches them with a bill for the cherries they ate. This action leads to the utter embarrassment of William and Rose, and successfully prevents Silas from ever making a profit on his cherries again. The small town is also rocked by the death of Ephraim Thayer, Barney's brother. Because Deborah Thayer viewed her other children, Barney and Rebecca, as lost causes, all her hope was placed in her youngest son who is quite ill with some type of heart ailment. Having been ill his entire life, Ephraim always received stronger amounts of Deborah's sternness. He lived a solitary childhood, never getting to experience and of the typical joys of youth. His mother always kept him on a strict diet and schedule, which contained nothing of what he wanted to do. As he gets older, Ephraim becomes more and more rebellious. He begins to sneak snacks that he is forbidden to eat, gives his mother a hard time when she tells him to do things, and secretly thinks of all the things he would do were she not around. One night Ephraim sneaks out to go sledding, knowing this is strictly against his mother's rules. The next day Ephraim fails to carry out one of Deborah's orders. In the midst of her anger from her other children, Deborah whips Ephraim, despite the fact that he had always spared such a punishment due to his poor health. Ephraim dies in the middle of the whipping and for a long time Deborah lives thinking she has killed her son. She is eventually made aware of Ephraim's joyride, which is more likely the cause of his death, but by this time she has already lost so much of herself from the strain placed on her by Rebecca and Barney that Ephraim's death is too much for her to handle. Deborah dies a sudden death, leaving her husband, Caleb to live alone in their house. The end of the novel brings focus back to Charlotte and Barney. It has been about ten years since their engagement was ended, and the town has stopped overflowing with rumors about them. Barney has taken up work as a woodcutter, and suddenly falls severely ill with rheumatism. Despite her parents‚Äô wishes, Charlotte maintains her dedication to Barney by going to take care of him. Once again, the town begins to talk. Everyone disapproves of Charlotte staying in Barney's house to nurse him when they are unwed. The townspeople send the minister to Charlotte to convey their feelings. Barney realizes what troubles he is bringing to Charlotte and tells her to leave his house. Charlotte says nothing, packs her things, and heads home. Barney then experiences a change. He becomes aware of the wrong he has been doing to Charlotte all these years, and the fact that Charlotte is still devoted to him brings him great guilt. Barney undergoes a type of spiritual healing that miraculously brings him back to health. The story is drawn to a close with the hopeful image of Barney walking up to the Barnard house, and announcing to Charlotte that he is back. ==Characters== Barney Thayer is the son of Deborah and Caleb Thayer. He is a central character of the novel, as his engagement to Charlotte Barnard sets the stage for the story. Barney is a very stubborn man, whose bullheadedness is the reason for his unhappiness throughout the novel. In the novel, Barney develops a hunched-back, which is a symbol of the inner turmoil he experiences while being separated from Charlotte.Quina Charlotte Barnard is the daughter of Sarah and Cephas Barnard. She is a proud and stubborn character, taking after the personality of her father more than that of her mother. Charlotte seems to always be aware of other people's suffering, particularly of Barney's. Her actions often do not fit in with what is expected of a female at the time. Caleb Thayer is Barney's father. Caleb is a meek man, often reminiscent of a child. He does not hold the typical place of the patriarchal father, and instead allows his wife, Deborah, to rule the house. Caleb is constantly sympathetic for his children and the harshness they must endure from their mother. Deborah Thayer is Barney's mother. She is a harsh, stern woman, who intimidates most members of the town. She plays the role of the patriarch in her family and rationalizes her harsh behavior through her religious motives.Quina Deborah brings about her own demise through her inability to sympathize with anyone and the responsibility she places on herself for the actions of her children. Rebecca Thayer is Barney's sister and the daughter of Caleb and Deborah. Like many characters in Pembroke, Rebecca is also stubborn and goes against the will of her mother when she continues to see William Berry. Rebecca plays the role of the \\"fallen woman\\" in the novel, as she begins in a place of respect and falls down the social ladder due to her premarital affair with William.Thomas Ephraim Thayer is the youngest son of Deborah and Caleb. He is ailed with a heart disease that prevents him from leading a normal childhood. Despite his mother's attempts to make him religiously conscious and obedient, Ephraim is just as rebellious as his siblings. Cephas Barnard is the husband of Sarah and father of Charlotte. Cephas is the reason behind the argument that ended Charlotte and Barney's engagement. Cephas fills the typical role of patriarchal father. He also is known for his strange views on the link between food and a person's spirit. Sarah Barnard is the wife of Cephas and mother of Charlotte. She is a dramatic woman, who is easily made anxious or overly emotional. She performs the typical housewife role and believes in everything Cephas does and says. Sylvia Crane is the sister of Sarah Barnard and Hannah Berry and is Charlotte's aunt. Sylvia is a relatively quiet and independent woman, who lives alone in the house she inherited from her parents. Sylvia is younger than her sisters, but has an old spirit. She kept all of her hopes in Richard Alger, even when it appeared that their relationship might be over. Richard Alger is the man who eventually marries Sylvia Crane, after an approximately eighteen-year courtship. Richard never seems to know exactly what he wants and treats Sylvia poorly, but redeems himself in the end when he saves Sylvia from the poorhouse and marries her. Hannah Berry is the sister of Sarah and Sylvia and wife of Silas Berry. While she is very upfront and her personality can seem slightly abrasive, she has a certain kind of loyalty to her family members that cannot be shaken. Rose Berry is the daughter of Hannah and Silas Berry and is Charlotte's cousin. Rose is a typical teenage girl, who is easily distracted by the prospect of love. However, Rose also believes that females should take an aggressive role in their love lives, as she demonstrates by telling Charlotte to pursue Barney and through her own active role in her love life. William Berry is the son of Hannah and Silas Berry and the brother of Rose. William is a responsible young man, who takes responsibility for his actions. When he learns that Rebecca has been kicked out of her house, he does not hesitate to marry her, even though he is no longer as in love with her as he once was. Silas Berry is the father of Rose and William and the husband of Hannah. Silas is a very greedy man, whose constant search for economic power causes him to be disliked by many of the townspeople. However, Silas is old and crippled and is easily intimidated by the youth and strength of his son. Thomas Payne is the son of the town squire. He is a wealthy, handsome, and respectable man. After Barney and Charlotte break their engagement, Charlotte recognizes Thomas as a respectable option, even a better man than Barney, but cannot marry him because she does not love him. Thomas handles this situation with grace, like he does all others. Mrs. Jim Sloane is the town drunkard. She is ostracized and looked down upon by the townspeople, who avoid her as much as possible. When Rebecca is banished from her home, it is Mrs. Sloane who finds her, takes her in, and walks her through the process of marrying William. Tommy Ray works at Silas Berry's store. Rose eventually chooses him as her marriage opportunity despite the fact that she sees him as a boy, not a man. ==Themes== Pembroke is a novel about the workings and dynamics that are characteristic of a small town, in this case, a small town in New England. Freeman treats each character individually and devotes much time to their personality, giving the events that take place in Pembroke a more authentic feel. Through her characters, Freeman gives focus to the effects a person can have on their own happiness, the changing role of women in society, and the changes family dynamics. These topics bring to light social changes that were becoming more popular in New England at the time. Each character of that Freeman has created is given the freedom to control his or her own future. However, many of these characters are so stubborn that they believe they are incapable of changing the way things are. Because none of them are able to see that they are causing their own problems, they are unwilling to change their opinions or habits and are often forced to live unhappily. The best example of this lies in Barney Thayer, who could have easily prevented all the years of torment that he endured had he simply approached Charlotte and apologized. Women play as critical a role in this book as men, if not more so. These women are often going against the wishes of the men in their lives, particularly their fathers, and breaking down social barriers that apply to relationships and the way they live their lives. Both Rebecca Thayer and Charlotte Barnard take control of their lives and go against social norms when they disregard the wishes of their parents and take control of their own lives. Rebecca goes against social norms even further by having premarital sex with William Berry. Sylvia Crane lives alone for many years and then marries at an older age, despite the fact that her actions go against the typical courting routine. Families in Pembroke tend not to follow the typical patriarchal setup. Many times the father is not the only authoritative figure in the family, assuming he holds any authority at all. In the Thayer family, Deborah is quite clearly the head of the family. She plays the role typically held by the father and acts as the decision maker and rule enforcer of the family while Caleb cowers under her control. Hannah Berry acts with equal power in her family as her husband, often overriding his commands, as she does at the cherry party. ==Critical response== Pembroke was Freeman's second novel and received much acclaim. The content of the book appealed to a large audience, who were already avid fans of Freeman's short stories. At the time, the novel was regarded as \\"the most profound, the most powerful piece of fiction of its kind that has ever come to the American press\\" by Kate Chopin and received similar praise from other contemporary writers.Freeman Another one is Conan Doyle who said, \\" I have not read a book for a long time that has stirred me as much as Miss Wilkins's 'Pembroke'. I think she is a very great writer. It is always risky to call a recent book a classic, but this one really seems to me to have every characteristic of one.\\" Due to its overwhelming popularity, Pembroke brought in a substantial amount of money for Freeman, mostly through its publication in the Harper's Weekly.Freeman ==NotesReferences== * Freeman, Mary E.

The case remained unsolved for two years, until Robert Anthony Buell was convicted of her murder in 1984. Harrison's case appeared on the fifth season of the American television show Forensic Files in an episode titled \\"Material Evidence.\\" == Abduction and murder == Police sketches of the suspect at the time of Krista Harrison's abduction. Eleven-year-old Krista Harrison Monahan, Richard, dir. \\"Material Evidence.\\" Forensic Files. TLC, TruTV. October 31, 2000. Television. (born May 28, 1971, Orrville, Ohio) had been picking up aluminum cans in the Marshallville park with one of her friends. The park was about one hundred yards from her home. It was reported by her friend that a man between 25 and 35 with shoulder-length hair drove up to Harrison in his van and forced her into the vehicle and drove away. Harrison's companion described the abductor's van to have been a brown or dark red color that had round windows on the sides, near the rear. After she was kidnapped, volunteers searched for her body across Marshallville to no avail. It was initially believed that the man would demand ransom for Krista's return, yet no contact was made. It was not until six days later that her remains, which were in an advanced stage of decomposition, were discovered in the weeds a few feet off the side of a scarcely traveled road in adjacent Holmes County, Ohio. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found in the vicinity of the dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather. Harrison was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville. ==Investigation== Fibers found on Tina Harmon's body, which were similar to those on Harrison's body On Harrison's body and the towel near the scene, a distinct number of nutmeg or orange-colored polyester fibers were found. After they were examined under a microscope, investigators concluded that they were of trilobal shape and were likely from some type of carpet. Similar fibers were found on the body of Tina Harmon, a 12-year-old girl who was raped and murdered eight months earlier. A man had already been convicted on circumstantial evidence in her death and was incarcerated when Harrison was abducted. Authorities then began to consider that both girls were victims of the same person, as they were both sexually violated, strangled, and killed in the same county. The two also had the same sort of fibers on their remains, further linking the crimes. The bag found wrapped around the lower half of Harrison's body was unique, as it had distinct folding patterns and thickness that occurred during the manufacturing process. The bag was traced to a factory in Pioneer, Ohio. Such bags were used for packaging a type of car seat, which was black in color. These seats, sold through Sears, were only available for a brief amount of time through mailing. The box containing Harrison's blood belonged to the same type of car seat. Sales records of the seats were subsequently examined from the store, to search for any Ohio resident who might have purchased the seats. Twenty-three people in northern Ohio had purchased this type of car seat, but none owned a van that matched the one used during the abduction. == Capture and trial of Robert Buell == After Harrison's body was found, a $10,000 reward was placed for information about the abductor, which showed composite sketches of the perpetrator. No one was arrested until two years later. In 1984, 44-year-old Robert Anthony Buell, employed by the state of Ohio, kidnapped a 28-year-old woman while she was working as a manager at an Ohio gas station in Damascus, Ohio. The woman's head was shaved, she was shocked with a severed electrical cord, beaten and was bound to Buell's bed and raped. She was able to escape, twelve hours later, fearing for her life, and ran to a nearby house and notified police after her attacker had left to go to work. Such a man had previously preyed on Ohio women, who were usually in their late twenties to forties. Robert Anthony Buell in 2001 Police then compared the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's body to the ones in Buell's van, which was the same color as the one seen in 1982. The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not match Buell‚Äôs fingerprints. Buell pleaded no contest to the abduction and rape of the adult victim, yet he denied any involvement with Krista's murder. He was found guilty after being tried and sentenced to death in 1984; he was executed by lethal injection in 2002. He denied involvement and was never charged with the death of Tina Harmon, although dog hairs belonging to the remains of one found buried at his residence matched. In 2010, DNA compared from the crime scene of Tina's murder to Buell's matched, therefore indicating that he was involved in her rape and most likely, her murder. Another victim who was murdered in 1983, Debora Kaye Smith, 10, had wax on her body that was from the same kind of candles that Buell owned. Her body was found over a month after her death, abandoned at the side of the Tuscarawas River. Former journalist for the Cleveland Scene magazine, James Renner, has written through several of his works that Buell's nephew, Ralph Ross Jr., may have played a role in the murders, if not having been fully responsible. He has also connected the cases to that of the unsolved murders of 13-year-old Barbara Barnes and 10-year-old Amy Mihaljevic. Similar fibers on the latter victim's body were found. ==See also== *List of solved missing persons cases ==References* Category:1982 in Ohio Category:1982 murders in the United States Category:1984 in Ohio Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Deaths by strangulation in the United States Category:July 1982 events in the United States Category:Murdered American children Category:Kidnappings in the United States Category:Missing person cases in Ohio Category:Murder in Ohio Category:Sexual assaults in the United States Category:Violence against children ","title":"Murder of Krista Harrison"},{"id":"35835615","text":"Sea Rescue is an American 30-minute reality television program which showcases documented stories of rescue, rehabilitation and return to the wild of marine animals by a team of dedicated vets, animal care experts, animal science researchers and government authorities.

Ancient Greek science, philosophy, democracy, architecture, literature, and art provided a foundation embraced and built upon by the Roman Empire as it swept up Europe, including the Hellenic world in its conquests in the 1st century BC. From its European and Mediterranean origins, Western civilization has spread to produce the dominant cultures of modern North America, South America, and much of Oceania, and has had immense global influence in recent centuries. == Nature of Western civilization == * Western world - The first civilizations made various unique contributions to the western civilizations.

The most imperative regions of Greek achievement were math and science. They accomplished a wide range of things in the territories of brain science, astronomy, geometry, science, material science, and physics. In philosophy, first civilizations had made numerous powerful contributions to western civilization. Greek philosophers were awesome thinkers who were resolved to look for truth to a specific subject or question regardless of where it drove them. The well-known philosophers trusted that life was not worth living unless it was inspected and the truth about existence was searched out. With a specific end goal to solve problems in life, Socrates created a method for taking care of these problems called the Socratic Method. On the planet today this method is generally known as the Scientific method and is utilized broadly in the region of science.

In his three years there (2009‚Äì12), Spoonhour had a record of 63‚Äì27. On April 6, 2012, Spoonhour was hired as the next head men's basketball coach at Eastern Illinois University of the Ohio Valley Conference. Spoonhour was chosen over a list of final candidates that also included Vanderbilt assistant David Cason, Oregon assistant Brian Fish, Nevada assistant Doug Novsek and Xavier assistant Kareem Richardson. In his first season as head coach, the Panthers finished 11‚Äì21 overall, but managed to make the conference tournament for the first time since the 2009‚Äì10 season. The Panthers were eliminated in the first round of the Ohio Valley Conference tournament by Southeast Missouri State. == Personal life == Jay is the son of former Missouri State, Saint Louis and UNLV head coach Charlie Spoonhour.

On May 8, 2012, it was sold at Christie's from the estate of David Pincus for $86,882,500, a record nominal price for post-war contemporary art at public auction. ==History== The work was acquired by Marlborough Fine Art in London from the Marlborough-Gerson gallery in New York. Marlborough Fine Art sold the work to David Pincus in 1967. Pincus is regarded as one of the leading American collectors in the second half of the 20th century. The work has not been on the market in the 45 years since Pincus' acquisition. It has been exhibited on occasion. From February to March 1964, it was exhibited at the Marlborough New London Gallery in London in a Mark Rothko exhibition. From September to November 1986 it was exhibited by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in its \\"Philadelphia Collects: Art Since 1940\\" exhibition. From June to December 1996 it was exhibited by the Palmer Museum of Art at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania for their \\"Abstraction to Figuration: Selections of Contemporary Art from the Pincus Collection\\" exhibition. It was also later on extended loan at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. ==2012 auction== This surpassed the 2007 record price for a Rothko work of $72.8 million set when David Rockefeller sold White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose). The hammer price was $77.5 million, and the price was $86.8 million including buyer's premium. It established a new record for post- war/contemporary art at a public auction, when ignoring inflation. The highest price paid for a post-war painting in a private sale is believed to be $140 million (~$160 million in May 2012 dollars) for Jackson Pollock's No. 5, 1948 in November 2006. In constant dollars, the record price for post-war art at a public auction remained with Triptych, 1976 by Francis Bacon, sold at Sotheby's for $86.3 million in May 2008 (~$92 million in May 2012 dollars). The price for Rothko's painting was expected to top out near $45 million based on presale estimates. When the record-setting 2012 auction price reached $70 million, three bidders remained competitive. The bidding extended for over six and a half minutes, which is \\"...one of the longest bidding matches yet witnessed in a contemporary art sale.\\" ==Critical commentary== Souren Melikian of The New York Times described Rothko's Orange, Red, Yellow as one that \\"...can convincingly be argued to be the most powerful of all his pictures\\", Kelly Crow of The Wall Street Journal stated that \\"The painting's trio of orange and yellow rectangles bobbing atop a cherry-red background forms a palette that's as eye-catching as a sunset or a Popsicle.\\", noting that \\"Auction specialists say collectors historically pay more for works that are red and gold, as opposed to gray.\\" ==See also== *List of most expensive paintings ==Notes *Christie's presentation *Christie's showroom video *Christie's record-setting sale press release Category:1961 paintings Category:Paintings by Mark Rothko ","title":"Orange, Red, Yellow"},{"id":"35835941","text":"Bina (Hausa: Binawa) is a Kainji language of Nigeria. ==References== Category:East Kainji languages Category:Languages of Nigeria ","title":"Bina language"},{"id":"35835952","text":"Vono, also known as Kiwollo (Kiballo), is a nearly extinct Kainji language of Nigeria. ==References== Category:East Kainji languages Category:Languages of Nigeria Category:Endangered Niger‚ÄìCongo languages ","title":"Vono language"},{"id":"35835955","text":"WISE J071322.55‚àí291751.9 (designation abbreviated to WISE 0713‚àí2917) is a brown dwarf of spectral class Y0, located in constellation Canis Major at approximately 23 light-years from Earth. ==Discovery== WISE 0713‚àí2917 was discovered in 2012 by J.

In September 2019, Saleh was nominated as head of the national Culture and Media Council of Sudan as part of the Cabinet of Sudan during the 2019 Sudanese transition to democracy. ==Education== Saleh graduated from al-Azhar University with a degree in journalism and from the University of Wales with a master's degree. ==Journalism== Saleh heads Teeba Press, an NGO which trains journalists, and is a former editor of the newspaper Al-Adwa. In the early years of the rule of president Omar al-Bashir, he was detained for several months for his critical reporting of the government. Along with several other journalists, he faced criminal charges in June 2011 after reporting on the alleged rape in custody of activist Safiya Ishag by agents of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service. ===Peter Mackler Award=== In 2013, Saleh received the Peter Mackler Award, an award for journalists named after Peter Mackler, chief editor for North America for Agence France-Presse for 29 years up to his death in 2008. The reasons cited for giving the award to Saleh included his \\"determination to see a free press unafraid to document government repression take root in his homeland\\" during the presidency of Omar al-Bashir. ==2012 arrest== Saleh gave an interview to Al Jazeera on 19 March 2012 in which he criticized a speech by al-Bashir. Saleh told the interviewer that he felt al-Bashir's government was raising tensions with South Sudan to make it a \\"scapegoat\\" for the South Kordofan rebellion in an effort to deflect the administration's own failures to deal with the rebellion's causes. Saleh also argued that the Sudanese government should attempt to solve the crisis with diplomacy rather than force, rather than risk the political and humanitarian consequences of an armed conflict. On 25 April, Saleh was ordered to report to Sudanese police for questioning; the police reportedly also warned him against speaking further to foreign media. After twelve days of interrogation, Saleh was charged with \\"crimes against the state\\" as well as new charges of defamation for his reporting the Safia Ishaag rape case, for which he had been already arrested the previous year. The arrest led Amnesty International to name him a prisoner of conscience, \\"imprisoned solely for the peaceful expression of his beliefs\\". The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information also condemned the arrest, describing it as part of \\"the severe decline of freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of the press\\" in Sudan. The Doha Centre for Media Freedom criticized Saleh's interrogations and detention, calling them \\"harassment\\" designed \\"to prevent Saleh from doing his work as a journalist\\". The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also called on Sudanese authorities to \\"release Saleh immediately and stop harassing him.\\" Reporters Without Borders described itself as \\"outraged at the violence and pressure\\" against Saleh, describing it as \\"further proof of the repressive attitude towards the press on the part of the Khartoum government, whose intention is to silence all dissident voices\\". Front Line Defenders called for the charges against Saleh to be dropped, and stated that they appeared to be \\"part of an ongoing campaign of judicial harassment and intimidation against the human rights defender\\". The International Federation of Human Rights called \\"on the Sudanese authorities to put an end to the judicial harassment faced by Mr. Salih\\", and launched a letter-writing campaign on his behalf. A group of journalists held a protest on 17 May in front of the headquarters of Sudan's Press and Publication Council to show solidarity with Saleh and calling for an \\"end to pre-censorship and restrictions against press and journalists\\".

At the time the Admiral of the station and the Admiralty rotated promising lieutenants through command of Trepassey and her sister ship, , on an annual basis. In 1792 Lieutenant Jahleel Brenton assumed command. In March 1793 Brenton and Lieutenant Tucker, commander of Placentia were at St Johns, Newfoundland when they received a letter from the governor of Saint Pierre and Miquelon inquiring about what news there was about the possible outbreak of war. Sensing that the governor would be willing to capitulate, Brenton set out to inquire further, while Tucker tried to assemble troops. When Brenton arrived at Saint Pierre on 16 May, he discovered that had arrived the day before from Halifax, Nova Scotia, together with the armed schooner , three transports and a number of troops. The governor of the island, M. Danseville, had surrendered without a fight and the island was under British control. Trepassey was then dispatched to take possession of Miquelon. In all, the British captured a battery consisting of eight 24-pounder guns, the garrison, of between 80 and 100 men, besides about 500 armed fishermen, and the whole population of the two islands, amounting to 741 people on Saint Pierre and 761 on Miquelon. The British also seized 20 vessels that were in the harbour: 18 small vessels laden with fish, and two American schooners containing provisions and naval stores. Richard Kevern was promoted to lieutenant on 24 October 1793 and replaced Brenton in command of Trepassey. In May 1796, Lieutenant John Hampstead took command.

He completed his degree in Philosophy in 1932 at the University of Turin, with a dissertation on Malebranche under the direction of Adolfo Faggi. Between 1934 and 1943 he published a series of essays on early modern philosophy 'La gnoseologia cartesiana nell‚Äôinterpretazione di Arnauld' - in Cartesio nel 111¬∞ centenario del Discorso sul Metodo, Vita e Pensiero 1937.'La veracit√† divina e i rapporti di ragione e fede nella filosofia di Malebranche' - in Malebranche nel terzo centenario della nascita, Vita e Pensiero 1938.'Note sulla critica malebranchiana' ibid. 1938.'Bibliografia Malebranchiana' ibid. 1938.'La personalit√† di Descartes' - preface to R. Descartes, Meditazioni metafisiche, Cedam, Padova, 1940.'L‚Äôattualit√† di Malebranche' - in L‚Äôattualit√† dei filosofi classici 1943. that established his reputation as a specialist in the field, not only in Italy but also in France where his work was praised by well-known scholars such as √âtienne Gilson and Henri Gouhier. His studies of modern rationalism reflected a broader interest in the relationship between Catholic thought and secular culture that he had developed during years in Turin. After having been one of the first Italian readers of French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, and a thoughtful anti-Fascist, Del Noce turned after the war to the question of the relationship between Christianity and Communism. In 1946 he published two essays on Marx'Intorno alla filosofia di Marx' - in Rivista di filosofia 1946.'La ‚Äúnon-filosofia‚Äù di Marx e il comunismo come realt√† politica' - in Il materialismo storico, Atti I congresso internazionale di Filosofia, Castellani, Roma 1946. which included an extended discussion of the place of atheism in Marx‚Äôs philosophy. His works on Marx were part of a lifelong interest in the role of atheism in the history of modern philosophy, which culminated in 1964 in his magnum opus The Problem of Atheism. In 1965 he also published a large monographic work Catholic Reformation and Modern Philosophy, Vol. 1: Descartes. In 1966 Del Noce was appointed Professor of History of Modern and Contemporary Philosophy at the University of Trieste, but in 1970 he transferred to the University of Rome \\"La Sapienza,\\" where he was appointed Professor of History of Political Doctrines and later Professor of Political Philosophy. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Del Noce's focus shifted to the theme of secularization and contemporary history. Some of his essays from this period were published in the 1971 volume The Age of Secularization. Later in that decade Del Noce returned to the question of the relationship between Catholics and Marxists and wrote two new books, The Catholic Communist and one of his most famous and controversial works, The Suicide of the Revolution, in which he argued that the process of dissolution of Marxism into neo-bourgeois nihilism is already at work in the thought of Antonio Gramsci. In his final years Del Noce became very much a ‚Äúpublic intellectual,‚Äù writing numerous articles in newspapers and weekly magazines, and becoming involved in the Italian political debate to the point of serving a term as a senator. His final philosophical work was an extensive monographGiovanni Gentile. Per una interpretazione filosofica della storia contemporanea, Il Mulino, Bologna 1990 on the philosophy of Giovanni Gentile and on his relationship with Fascism. Del Noce died suddenly on December 30, 1989, a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin wall had marked symbolically the final disintegration of the Marxist revolution, which he had predicted many years earlier on philosophical grounds. In his native Italy Del Noce is widely regardedFor a recent appraisal of the significance of Del Noce's work see the program of events for the 100th anniversary of his birth (in Italian) as one of the pre-eminent philosophers and political thinkers of the second half of the 20th century. Although he was a distinguished scholar of early modern philosophy, he is especially remembered for his penetrating exegesis of the philosophy of Marx, for his innovative interpretation of Fascism and for his critique of the progressive-technocratic culture that became gradually dominant in Europe after World War II. ==Philosophical themes== A common thread of Del Noce's work is the attempt to understand the connection between philosophical ideas and socio-political history. Against the prevailing Marxist and neo-positivist opinions of his contemporaries, he always maintained that philosophical ideas influence the course of human history, and that modern history in particular can only be understood as the unfolding of certain philosophical options (rationalism, immanentism, scientism). In fact, one of his core ideas was that modern history, if correctly interpreted, provides the best vindication of classical metaphysics by showing that rationalism leads to contradictory outcomes, as exemplified by the trajectory of Marxism. In some of his best known works Il suicidio della rivoluzione', Rusconi, Milano 1978 he advanced the thesis that Marxism suffers what he called an \\"heterogenesis of ends,\\" meaning that it is destined to triumph and self-destruct at the same time, due to its internal contradictions. To triumph, because Marx‚Äôs radical atheism and materialism are the most consistent outcomes of European rationalism. To self-destruct because, as soon as the revolutionary dream fades away, Marxian historical materialism must degenerate into absolute relativism and open the way to a ‚Äúperfectly bourgeois‚Äù society, a de-humanized world that does not recognize any permanent order of values and in which alienation becomes complete. More generally, Del Noce regarded the expansion of atheism as the central question of modern philosophy.Il problema dell'ateismo, Il Mulino, Bologna 1964 Its appearance at the endpoint of all forms of rationalism reveals that rationalism itself is based on a precondition, namely the decision to reject any notion of an original fall. A careful investigation of philosophy after Descartes shows that rejecting the status naturae lapsae was the first step in rejecting the supernatural, to be followed later on by the rejection of every form of transcendence. However, since these rejections cannot be based on any proof, atheism can only justify itself as the outcome of an irreversible historical process, understood as a process of secularization and, at the same time, as the only practical attitude which is capable of actually producing universal human fulfillment. In other words, for late rationalism the criterion of truth of a philosophy reduces to its ability to surpass and integrate all previous forms of thought. For this reason, Del Noce regarded the periodization of history of philosophy itself as the crucial theoretical question of contemporary philosophy. In his book The Problem of Atheism he argued that, precisely in order to place atheism in the history of philosophy, it is necessary to call into question and to abandon the view that the process of the history of thought is a unitary process towards immanentism. This shows that atheism is not the necessary outcome of modern philosophy, but rather a problematic outcome, inasmuch it does not lead to the promised fulfillment but rather to forms of nihilism. Contemporary history provides the best proof that the trajectory of rationalism has a nihilistic endpoint: atheism has achieved complete success not in the historical implementation of Marxism, but rather in the affluent society, which pushes to the extreme the de-humanization of the relationship with the other. In its historical realization Marxism has ended up being a stage in the development of the affluent society, which accepts all its negations of traditional thought but at the same time eliminates the messianic/religious aspect of Marxism.Secolarizzazione e crisi della modernit√†, Esi, Napoli 1982 In the late 1960s Del Noce‚Äôs focused his attention on the task of constructing a philosophical interpretation of the most recent developments in contemporary history. In particular, he felt the need for a clear philosophical understanding of the new challenges that were being posed by the progressivism of the 1960s (in both its secular and Catholic forms), by the rampant secularization of European society, by the sexual revolution and in general by the new technocratic and affluent society that had taken shape after the Second World War. His most significant essays from this period were collected in the volume The Age of Secularization. Del Noce argued that Western history after 1945 was marked by a particular interpretation of the historical period between the two World Wars. According to this ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù interpretation, Nazism and Fascism were symptoms of a general collapse of European civilization, which must be replaced by a new civilization based on science and on the rejection of all metaphysical doctrines. This has led to a type of new Enlightenment, which however is an Enlightenment after Marx, inasmuch it preserves all of Marx‚Äôs metaphysical negations. Del Noce maintained that the outcome of this new scientistic- relativistic-progressivist culture is necessarily nihilistic and totalitarian, since science per se is not capable of formulating new ideals. As a response, he developed a different interpretation of contemporary history,L'interpretazione transpolitica della storia contemporanea, Guida, Napoli 1982. in which Fascism and Nazism are just stages in a broader process of secularization that actually centers on Marxism and on the failure of the modern ‚Äúrevolutionary gnosis.‚Äù He also argued that the correct way to answer the challenge posed by secularization is not by rejecting modernity altogether but by correcting it in light of the classical metaphysical tradition, which must be rediscovered, renewed and purified. Del Noce wrote extensivelySee the essays collected in Rivoluzione Risorgimento Tradizione, Giuffre\`, Milano 1993 about Freudo-Marxism and on the relationship between political progressivism and the sexual revolution. He argued that both of them are rooted in the denial a priori that human reason is capable of reaching meta-empirical truths, and so they are tightly linked with scientism, the dogmatic belief that the empirical sciences are the only form of rationality. The reduction of reason to science goes hand in hand with the reduction of freedom to the satisfaction of instincts, which in turn is expressed politically as fight against ‚Äúrepression‚Äù and leads to a radical rejection of all traditional values. He further argued that the scientistic postulate is intrinsically totalitarian, inasmuch it de-legitimates all other forms of knowledge. Del Noce also studied in depth the relationship between freedom and authority. In a long essayAutorita\`, in Rivoluzione Risorgimento Tradizione, Giuffre\`, Milano 1993 from 1975 he pointed out that, whereas in the classic and humanistic tradition authority was associated with liberation (e.g. from the power of sub-human instincts and from social manipulation), contemporary culture associates authority with repression. As a result, the modern world confuses authority and power with disastrous effects. In particular, the progressive culture since World War II has associated the defense of freedom with the rejection of metaphysical knowledge and the embrace of relativism. However, any form of liberalism that does not acknowledge the nature of authority must conclude to an even greater oppression, by making the individual completely dependent on society. According to Del Noce, freedom can only defended by rediscovering the true meaning of authority, which is tightly linked to the idea of evidence. Evidence is the foundation and the paradigm of authority, because it asks of the mind a more radical submission than could be obtained by force, but in this submission the mind finds its ultimate liberation from all arbitrary social powers. Thus, Del Noce said, the theme of authority brings us back to the Socratic origins of classical metaphysics, which have to be rediscovered in order to overcome the present crisis of our civilization. ==Selected bibliographyIn English=== * Thomism and the critique of rationalism, Communio 25 (1998): 732-45 * The Crisis of Modernity, McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal 2015 * Authority versus power, Communio 42 (2015): 265-300 * The lesson of Maritain, Maritain Studies 31 (2016): 71-80 * The Age of Secularization, McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal 2017 * Marxism died in the East because it realized itself in the West, Church Life Journal, January 16, 2020 ===In Italian=== * Il problema dell'ateismo, Il Mulino, Bologna 1964 * Riforma cattolica e filosofia moderna, vol.

She first appeared in Lloyd's Register in 1812 with origin Whitby and launch year of 1809.Lloyd's Register (1811), seq. ‚ÑñIJ320. This is the information that Bateson reproduces. However, the Register of Shipping for 1811 shows her origin as Shields, and her launch year as 1810.Register of Shipping (1811), Seq.‚ÑñIJ335. The most complete history of Whitby shipping has no listing for Indian. By contrast, Hackman has precise launch data and burthen, suggesting that his launch year of 1810 and place of Jarrow/Shields is correct. A database of vessels built on the Tyne also gives her year and location as 1810 and Jarrow. ==Career== Captain Andrew Barclay acquired a letter of marque on 7 June 1810. Under his command, Indian sailed from England on 18 July 1810 and arrived at Port Jackson on 16 December 1810. She embarked 200 male convicts, of whom eight died on the voyage.

It was published posthumously in 1903 by Doubleday, Page & Company and composed primarily of recently published works. ==The stories== * \\"A Deal in Wheat\\" * \\"The Wife of Chino\\" * \\"A Bargain with Peg-Leg\\" * \\"The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock\\" * \\"A Memorandum of Sudden Death\\" * \\"Two Hearts that Beat as One\\" * \\"The Dual Personality of Sick Dick Nickerson\\" * \\"The Ship That Saw a Ghost\\" * \\"The Ghost in the Crosstrees\\" * \\"The Riding of Felipe\\" ==Plot summary and character list\\"A Deal in Wheat\\"=== The story A Deal in Wheat was first published as a serial in 1902 before being published posthumously as part of this collection the following year. It is a five part story about wheat speculation at the Chicago Board of Trade. As wheat prices fall in the midst of an economic feud between two influential speculators, the story's protagonist, a wheat farmer from Kansas, loses his farm. The book ends with the farmer relocating to Chicago, where he is denied free bread due to rising wheat prices. Influenced by naturalism, which the author contrasted with the realism. The latter he found to be too superficial, honing in on the \\"accuracy\\" of surface details, while naturalism he understood to dramatize the \\"truth\\" to expose the relations between people from different segments and classes underlying the everyday experiences of life. Plot :I. The first of the five sections of the story, entitled \\"The Bear- Wheat at Sixty- Two\\", takes place in rural Kansas. Sam Lewiston leaves his wife, Emma, home on the ranch while he goes into town one last time to try to sell his wheat to Bridges & Co., Grain Dealers before being forced out of the market. At sixty- two cents a bushel, Lewiston can no longer afford to raise wheat and must take a job with his wife‚Äôs brother in Chicago. :II. The next section, \\"The Bull- Wheat at a Dollar-Ten\\", introduces the two main players of the Chicago-run wheat business, the bear and the bull: Treslow and Hornung. When Treslow had let the price fall to sixty-two cents, Hornung had almost run him out of business. Instead, Mr. Gates makes a deal with Treslow, on behalf of Hornung, to sell him one hundred thousand bushels for export at $1.10 each. :III. Hornung has grown to dominate wheat sales at $1.50 a bushel. One day in \\"The Pit\\", a mysterious man named Kennedy sells one thousand bushels to three of Hornung‚Äôs men: Going, Kimbark, and Merriam. They get word that a total of twenty-five thousand bushels are being sold in Chicago by someone other than Hornung. Hornung instructs them to continue buying but, with The Bear supposedly out of the market, they do not know who they are buying from. :IV. The fourth section, \\"The Belt Line\\", takes place in Hornung‚Äôs home. His broker, Billy, and a detective named Cyrus Ryder are there to discuss the now eighty thousand bushels he has purchased. Ryder reveals that the bushels are the same ones that Treslow had purchased to export. He had been shuttling them around the city on trains, making it appear as if they had just arrived. Hornung laughs upon finding out he has been cheated, and decides to further raise the price. :V. The final section of the story, \\"The Bread Line\\", describes Sam Lewiston‚Äôs life in Chicago. He stands in the bread line with many other poor, hungry workers who rely on the bakery‚Äôs nightly giveaways, but the price of wheat has put too much of a strain on the bakery. Lewiston manages to find work as a street cleaner and climb the rankings to success but, because of his experiences as a farmer and a worker, his resentment towards the operators of the wheat business will not die. Character list * Sam Lewiston * Emma Lewiston * Truslow * Mr. Gates * Hornung * Going * Kimbark * Merriam * Kennedy * Billy * Cyrus Ryder ===\\"The Wife of Chino\\"=== Plot :I. The story starts off with \\"Chino‚Äôs Wife\\", in which Lockwood, the superintendent of the Hand-over-fist Gravel Mine in Placer County, California, sits in solitude on his porch smoking tobacco after dinner. He graduated from the Columbia School of Mines and has since spent his life in isolated Western mining communities. He enjoys isolation, and spends every evening admiring the scenery and fantasizing about Felice Zavalla, a beautiful Mexican woman married to one of his employees. :II. \\"Madness\\", documents Lockwood‚Äôs strong desire to be married to Felice despite his inability to understand her. He has never seen the world or socialized much, having studied for the first part of his life and worked for the latter. His isolation causes him to get carried away with emotions, and he is convinced he should have Felice. :III. In \\"Chino Goes to Town\\", Lockwood begins finding excused to interact with Felice, such as to give her mail, until he at once realizes that he has crossed the line and begins to avoid her entirely. He, instead, buries himself in his work until an accident in the mine breaks his foot. He usually goes to the Iowa Hill Post Office every couple of weeks with Chino to deliver the brick of gold collected from the mine, but his injury prevents him from going. He is left with nothing but thoughts of Felice to ease the pain. :IV. In the section, \\"A Dispatch from the Express Messenger\\", Felice confronts Lockwood and asks why he has been avoiding her. She gave him a look that told him she had made a mistake with Chino. Just when Lockwood realizes that he will not keep himself from having an affair with Felice he gets a message from Iowa Hill informing him of a criminal named Reno Kid on the trail. The messenger advises him not to leave, but Chino was already on his way. Lockwood realizes he has no other options, and struggles his way onto a horse and takes off. :V. \\"The Trail\\" documents Lockwood‚Äôs pursuit of Chino. He almost reaches Iowa Hill with no sign of him or Reno Kid, so he turns around to search harder. He eventually hears a horse galloping in the darkness and assumes it to be Reno Kid and shoots, but it is Chino. :VI. \\"The Discovery of Felice\\" begins when Lockwood arrives back at the Zavalla‚Äôs house and confesses his actions to Felice. Felice fetches the doctor and, as he examines Chino‚Äôs wound, she tells Lockwood that now they can be together. Lockwood, however, suddenly sees Felice in a different light. She appears savage and unfaithful. Character list * Lockwood * Felice Zavalla * Chino Zavalla * Reno Kid ===\\"A Bargain with Peg-Leg\\"=== Plot :This story describes Bunt McBride‚Äôs account of Peg-Leg Smith, an infamous one-legged criminal. Bunt retells the story on his break from the night shift at the mine. :Peg-Leg amputated his own leg and fashioned himself one from a tree stump after he was shot. He was known for his nastiness and spent his life trying to get people to stop using cuss words. Bunt encountered him at a bar in Yuma when Bunt was just a teenager. He was there watching his friend, Clarense, play a gambling game with some men that involved taking their temperatures. Clarence won, and the guys start accusing him of cheating. Peg-Leg had been sleeping in the back room, but he appeared and tackled Clarence from across the room. Bunt jumped to Clarence‚Äôs defense and pulled off Peg-Leg‚Äôs leg. Knowing he was in trouble, he chucked the wood out the window, grabbed Peg-Leg‚Äôs gun from the back room, and took off across the street. Outside, a kid had gone to retrieve the leg and went to hand it to Peg-Leg, but Bunt grabbed it. Peg-Leg assured Bunt that he would come after him someday. Bunt knew what Peg-Leg is capable of and did not want to live in fear, but he also knew his weakness, so he made a deal with Peg-leg to never swear again in exchange for his safety. Peg-Leg was desperate to have at least one convert, so he gave in. :Three years later, Bunt says, he came across Peg-Leg again in Sonora, Arizona. The town was full of men seeking gold. He got word that a hotel was on fire and rushed over to see Peg-Leg at the window of the flaming building. People below were yelling for him to jump, promising to catch him on a blanket. Bunt starts chucking before he can finish the story. There hadn‚Äôt been a blanket there. Character list * Bunt McBride * Peg-Leg Smith * Clarence ===\\"The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock\\"=== Plot :This story, like the last, describes Bunt McBride‚Äôs account of the life of a Western criminal, Cock-Eye Blacklock. Bunt and the narrator finish dinner by the campfire and ride out into the Idaho desert because it is Bunt‚Äôs night to ride the herd. Bunt has lived in the West for a long time and is wise when it comes to herding. :Bunt begins his story by recounting a herding experience in a Nevada blizzard. He and Cock-Eye Blacklock rubbed tobacco juice in their eyes to stay awake. Blacklock was a bad man and had killed a lot of people. Bunt says that he went bad about two years after that, though, He traveled around gambling, taking all the money from a community before moving on. He got through New Mexico and Arizona and was making his way through Nevada when he shot a kid in Reno and headed up to a mining camp in Placer County, California. He immediately got into trouble there, too, and before long was driven out of camp. :Bunt lived nearby in Iowa Hill at the time, and he used to take weekly fishing trips to the American River with his boss. On one trip they noticed that all the fish had been shot out of the river. The Fish Commissioners of the State assigned a guard to the area, but the fish kept dying. Blacklock was an obvious suspect, so Bunt, the Boss, and a marshal set up shooting boxes in trees to stand watch and try to catch him in the act. Unsuccessful for weeks, they caught a break one day with the help from a local dog named Sloppy Weather. Blacklock threw dynamite into the water to kill the fish, but Sloppy Weather jumped in to fetch the dynamite and bring it back. Blacklock ran, but the dog chased him until the dynamite went off and they both got caught in the explosion. On his grave they wrote, \\"Moral: A hook and line is good enough fish-tackle for any honest man\\". :The sun rises over the desert just as Bunt finishes the story. He and the narrator ride back into camp. Character list * Bunt McBride * Cock-Eye Blacklock * Narrator * The boss * The marshal * Sloppy Weather ===\\"A Memorandum of Sudden Death\\"=== Plot :In this story the narrator reads a manuscript written by Arthur Staples Karslake just before he died while serving in the United States Cavalry. The narrator has no personal connection to the author but has received permission from Patterson Karslake, the author‚Äôs brother, to publish the manuscript. He gets it form Juan Tejada, a harness-maker in Albuquerque, who has been keeping it for a bone collector by the name of Bass while he is on a trip in the Klondike. Parts of the manuscript are in pen and parts are in pencil. The narrator interjects periodically while reading the manuscript to explain that the pieces are in fragments. :The manuscript begins with Bunt, Idaho, Estorijo, and Karslake spotting 8 Native Americans following them while they are jogging. They stop to get water, and Karslake writes the first account while they are stopped. In it he refers to them as \\"bucks\\". They continue on, and the next day it appears as if there are 9. The \\"bucks\\" charge towards them, but veer off at the last minute, then circle around and continue following them. They constantly move in and out of shooting range, but Idaho manages to kill one of them. Shots are fired periodically, but each day the four men continue on and each night they set up camp. On the fifth and final day of the account Bunt, Idaho, Estorijo, and all of their horses have died. Karsdale describes a feeling of revelation he experiences as he weakens and death grows closer. He explains that, as death is upon him, he begins to understand the secret of life. He identifies himself and the other men he was with, and he leaves his unfinished work to his brother, Patterson Karslake. Character list * Arthur Staples Karslake * Patterson Karslake * Juan Tejada * Bass * Luis Estorijo * Idaho * Bunt ===\\"Two Hearts That Beat as One\\"=== Plot :In this story, Bunt McBride, shocked that Mr. Dixon is not familiar with The Three Black Crows, retells a story of one of their missions on the Pacific arranged, as usual, by Cyrus Ryder. This story is the first of four in the collection about The Three Black Crows. :Barreto Palachi was a revolutionary trying to get to San Francisco to smuggle arms, but he could not get there without being arrested. Cyrus Ryder sent Bunt, Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan to meet with Palachi‚Äôs agent, Esperanza Ulivarri. Bunt was not looking forward to the meeting, as he notes that he is not good with females. Esperanza instructed the four men on how to meet Palachi in San Diego, and gave them half of a calling card to match with the other half that she was to give him. They were struck by her beauty, and Hardenberg and Strokher immediately began fighting over who would have her when they left her office. The arguing continued aboard the schooner, and on a calm day they held a boxing match. It was very competitive but ended in a draw. :When they arrived in the San Diego Harbor Esperanza and another woman appeared in a rowboat. The woman was Palachi in disguise and, while he climbed aboard, Hardenberg and Strokher both get into the rowboat and stay behind with Esperanza. Character list * Bunt McBride * Hardenberg * Strokher * Ally Bazan * Cyrus Ryder * Mr. Dixon * Barreto Palachi * Esperanza Ulivarri ===\\"The Dual Personality of Slick Dick Nickerson\\"=== Plot :I. The first section of this story takes place in Cyrus Ryder‚Äôs office in San Francisco. The Three Crows, Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan, are ready for their next assignment, and are considering sailing to Point Barrow in Alaska where some Russians are hunting sea otters. Their skins can be sold to China for great profit. Ryder tells them that an agent of his named Dick Nickerson must accompany them. He used to be a Methodist preacher but he hit his head one day and, when he regained consciousness, he had no memory of his past. A month after this meeting the team departed on the Bertha Miller. :II. The sail to Alaska is a rough journey filled with poor weather and freezing temperatures. They finally arrive and locate the hunters, to whom they pretend to be a rescue boat searching for survivors from a nearby steam whaler wreck. Strokher remains onboard while the others befriend the Russians, get them drunk, and steal the otter skins. :III. The Bertha Miller departs, but Dick Nickerson takes a bad fall on the deck and hits his head. His condition improves after a few days, but he does not remember why they are there. The others explain the purpose of their mission and show him the skins to try to probe his memory. They arrive in Juneau and, immediately upon disembarking, Dick goes to the customs office. He tells an officer that he is a Methodist minister being detained on a pirate ship with stolen goods. The Three Crows frantically leave the port and, thinking they are being pursued by a U.S. cutter, burn the otter skins. The cutter approaches, and two men on board inform them that their crewmember broke into the American consul and resisted arrest. Character list * Cyrus Ryder * Hardenberg * Strokher * Ally Bazan * Dick Nickerson ===\\"The Ship That Saw a Ghost\\"=== Plot :In this story Mr. Dixon describes a dangerous mission, B. 300, he attempted with The Three Black Crows aboard the Glarus. Everyone thought they were heading back up to San Francisco from Callao but, in fact, they were traveling further south. Dixon says that the mission gave the Glarus a bad reputation, and now no one in the San Francisco Bay Area is willing to take her out again. They think she is haunted. :The sailors had seen nothing but ocean for days, and the isolation was getting to them. They were looking for an island that a boat had come across 200 years prior. Dixon does not say what they did there for fear of getting in trouble with the maritime law, but it was evil. As they were leaving the island something came out of the sea that killed twenty men within a week. After another week there were six men remaining, and they all died on the island. Dixon recalls that each of the men on the Glarus felt uneasy about the mission. He felt like they were being watched. One night Strokher said he fell asleep while on watch and awoke to find a ship in the distance. It was unusual looking, with three masts and no sails, and looked abandoned and frightening. The same night their shaft broke. They decided to continue for the island, but for days the wind would not let them budge. They had no choice but to turn around and saw the old ship in the distance behind them as they left. Upon returning to San Francisco the word spread that the Glarus had seen a ghost, and she has not seen the sea since. Character list * Mr. Dixon * Strokher * Hardenberg * Ally Bazan ===\\"The Ghost in the Crosstrees\\"=== Plot :I. Cyrus Ryder wants to claim a new island, the Island of Paa, so he calls upon the Three Black Crows. It had previously been discovered by \\"Old Rosemary\\", but be had died while his title application was being processed. Ryder knows that great profit lies within the island in the form of nitrate beds. Another man named Petersen is also after the island, so he stresses the urgency to Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan. They agree to fix up the Idaho Loss to take on the mission. :II. Mr. Dixon, the story‚Äôs narrator, goes to visit the three men at the port in Oakland where they are working on the boat. He stays over, and wakes up in the middle of the night to find Hardenberg staring at something in the air behind him. :III. Hardenberg tells Dixon of a moving figure in the crosstrees of the foremast. They witness the figure raise the sails and then disappear. They decide not to tell the others in the morning, but it comes out when Ally Bazan asks why the sails are raised. Ally Bazan is scared, but the other three stand watch the next night and chase it off. The following night all four of them stand watch, but it does not return for three nights. They stop watching, and wake up to raised sails in the morning. :IV. The ghost only appears when Ally Bazan is not standing watch. Ally Bazan does not want to take the haunted boat to sea. Strokher falls ill, so the Three Crows decide to abort the mission. Two years later, Dixon and Ally Bazan are on a duck-hunting trip when the same figure appears. As it is hoisting the jib its face catches the light, and Dixon identifies Ally Bazan as the figure. He asks Ally Bazan if he sleepwalks, but never brings up the ghost.

In the first section, entitled \\"Felipe\\", Felipe Arillaga leaves the home of Rubia Ytuerate, where he has lived for three months having an affair with Rubia. He misses his wife, Buelna Martiarena, but Rubia is furious and vows to curse the woman who Felipe next kisses. Felipe is superstitious and stops to confess at the mission, but he runs into Buelna and her uncle, Old Martiarena. He kisses Buelna‚Äôs hand, but can offer no explanation when Old Martiarena demands to know why he won‚Äôt kiss her. Buelna rides away, leaving Felipe heartbroken. :II. The next section is called \\"Unzar\\". Felipe, after a month of misery from losing Buelna, stops for the night at Lopez Catala‚Äôs wine shop on a ride home from Monterey. Unzar Ytuerate arrives looking for Felipe, for he is Rubia‚Äôs brother and has been sent to kill him. The two begin fighting with knives. :III. In \\"Rubia\\", Felipe wakes up in a bed and the inn with bandages on his head and shoulder. Rubia is there, and she explains that a week after sending Unzar for him she realized her mistake. She professes her love for Felipe, but Felipe insists that he loves Buelna. Rubia kisses Felipe, besetting her curse upon herself. Unzar is dying, so Rubia rushes to his bedside. He yells at her for not standing by him after driving him into the fight, then he dies. Rubia repeats the words of her curse, realizing that it has come true. :IV. The final section, \\"Buelna\\", begins when Felipe stops at the Rancho Martiarena and demands to talk to Buelna. Rafael, the superintendent, tells him that she left for Santa Teresa that day and will become a nun at midnight. Felipe rushes away to try to stop her. The journey to Santa Teresa is long and Pepe, Felipe‚Äôs horse, struggles quite a bit towards the end. After many obstacles, they arrive just as Buelna is kneeling at the altar. They kiss in the middle of the church, and get married the following day. Two days later a beautiful woman drowns in a river near Lopez Catala‚Äôs wine shop.

Though short stories and essays, including this collection, were published after The Pit, they did not affect Norris' reputation as he was viewed primarily as a novelist. Bixler notes, however, \\"the scattered reviews of these books were not flattering\\" (Bixler 119). Some stories were described as merely anecdotal, while stories like \\"The Ship That Saw a Ghost\\" were enjoyed for their \\"sensational value\\" (Dillingham 172). Franklin Walker describes \\"The Wife of Chino\\" as an \\"ineffective melodrama\\" (Walker 288). ==Other== :Frank Norris preferred writing novels to short stories, but he understood that, once he had established himself as a successful American novelist, he would be able to sell short stories and articles to periodicals to make additional money. As a result, a number of his short stories were thrown together during times when he needed an additional income. Norries wrote \\"A Memorandum of Sudden Death\\", \\"A Bargain with Peg-Leg\\", and \\"The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock\\" so that he could afford to buy his wife, Jeanette Black, a Christmas present (Walker 286). :A 1909 film directed by D.W. Griffith, A Corner in Wheat, was based on Norris' \\"A Deal in Wheat\\", along with his 1903 novel The Pit. ==References== * Bixler, Paul H.

Within the Flower family are Father and Mother Flower and their seven children, including their oldest daughter Flax Flower. Father Flower is an unappreciated poet who matches all of his children's names with one of their personal traits. Father Flower raises flowers to be sold in market, and each of his flower boxes is arranged so that only flowers with complementary colors and rhyming names are in adjoining beds. The Flowers live in a quaint home surrounded by flowerbeds that the family works hard to maintain. Each of the children takes part in the labor necessary for the upkeep of the flowerbeds, but the eldest daughter Flax Flower takes on the most responsibility. Father Flower and Flax are very close, and he often confides in her that he sometimes wishes he had for more to offer for his family. While working on the flowers one day, a rainstorm comes through and produces the most beautiful rainbow. Father Flower tells Flax that he wishes he could find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Flax, having never heard of this before, listens while her father tells her of the pot of gold and recites to her the poem he has made about it. Flax insists that if they find the pot of gold, they will be rich and can live a happier life, but Father Flower tells her that it is impossible to find the pot of gold for the rainbow will fade away before they can reach it. When the next rainbow shows across the river on the mountain, Flax Flower plans how she can reach the large pine tree where the rainbow ends. A few days later, when a shower is suspected after a hot sunny day, Flax sets out to reach the pine tree before the rainbow fades. While searching through the woods, Flax can hear the trees of the forest speaking the same poem her father had shared with her. As the rain starts falling, the trees and leaves grow louder and louder, and as the sun starts shining through the trees, the song is louder than ever and she is surrounded by the colored rays of the rainbow. Flax reaches the tree, and the pot of gold, shining so bright it was almost blinding, and remains even after the rainbow fades. She opens the pot, and instead of being filled with gold and riches, Flax can see the smiling faces of her family at home. Flax runs home to tell her family what she has seen in the pot of gold. Her father tells her that she is mistaken, for if she found the real pot of gold at the end of the rainbow it would be filled with gold pieces. When Mother Flower hears the story, she tells Flax that she did find the true treasure, and Flax is truly happy even if she didn‚Äôt find the real Pot of Gold her father was speaking of. The last line of the story is ‚ÄúBut, after all, do you know, I think her father was mistaken, and that she had.‚Äù  Characters  * Flax Flower * Father Flower * Mother Flower ===\\"The Cow With Golden Horns\\"===  Plot summary  ‚ÄúThe Cow With Golden Horns‚Äù is a story of a farmer and his daughter Drusilla who have a cow with two gold horns.

The king, who had been looking for a suitable daughter to marry to the Prince of Egypt, agrees to help find the cow if she will, in return, come be his daughter.

In anger, the King sends Drusilla home to her father with nothing. As she arrives at home, the gold-horned cow appears in the meadow carrying baskets of jewels and gold. When the king hears of the cows return, he comes to the cottage to apologize to Drusilla and offers her the princess title once again.

The inhabitants of Romalia, overjoyed to have the bees and delicious honey, treated the bees so well that they have never returned to the kingdom across the river. At the end of the Bee Festival, the King and Queen return home, with two nurses carrying Princess Rosetta in her basket. Since the baby is so quiet, the nurses deduce that she must be asleep and continue on home. When they return home, the nurses plan to take the baby from her basket and put her straight to bed, without waking her for her nightly routines.

When the Pop-Corn man hears that the Princess was missing, he states that he will rescue the princess and takes a group of 6 boys across the river to the other Kingdom to sell his popcorn. The King across the river loves the popcorn, declares it the new food of the Kingdom, and sets his people to work growing, popping, and eating the corn. This constant popping of corn, however, tires out the Kingdom and when the King of Romalia hears that his daughter is across the river, he is able to lay siege to the city successfully to rescue the Princess. The Princess, in the end, marries the son of the King across the river, and as a wedding present the King of Romalia gives a beautiful beehive.

Ann, having dark black curly hair and black eyes, is not what Samuel Wales and his wife had expected of their bound girl. Ann is also acute, and watches carefully as Samuel places her papers, binding her to this family, in his desk drawer and locks it. As time passes, Samuel Wales and his wife begin realizing that they have their hands full with Ann, as she is very mischievous. Mrs. Deacon Thomas Wales, Samuel Wales‚Äô mother, shows kindness to Ann and always took a liking to her. She, unlike Mrs. Polly, feels that Ann should be out enjoying her childhood instead of doing work around the house all day. Ann attends a school for three months of the year, and while there she meets a friend, Hannah French, and when she asks Mrs. Polly one day if she can go ice skating with Hannah and gets told no, Ann gets very angry. After Samuel Wales and his wife leave, Ann takes her papers from the desk drawer where they were locked in and runs away. Ann runs to Hannah French's house, drops off her doll, and tells Hannah of her plan. As Ann ran as fast as she could down the Boston Road, Captain French, who is informed by Hannah of Ann's plan, swoops her and returns her to the Wales residence. Scared for the repercussions of her actions, Ann saunters into the kitchen only to find it still empty. She places her papers back in the desk, never to disturb them again. Deacon Thomas Wales dies, and grandma requests that Ann come stay with her to heal her loneliness.

In the will of Deacon Thomas Wales, he leaves to his wife Sarah the Southwest fire-Room of his house as well as the privilege to retrieve water from the well and to bake in the oven whatever she might need. To his sons Ephraim and Atherton he leaves his homeplace, but Ephraim already has a good home of his own so Atherton and family move into the house alone. Mrs. Dorcas, Atherton's wife, is eager to increase her status by moving into this beautiful house but is disturbed by the fact that she can‚Äôt use the Southwest room for herself. Grandma doesn‚Äôt approve much of Mrs. Dorcas and is nervous to share a home with her, but as she is her youngest son's wife, she gives in. Ann comes to live with grandma, despite the hesitations of Samuel Wales and his wife, but Mrs. Dorcas is not very fond of her for she thinks that Grandma should pay more attention to her real granddaughter, the baby Thirsey. Throughout their time in the house together, Ann and Mrs. Dorcas don‚Äôt get along and Ann's mischievous side shines through a bit. One day, Ann ruins all of Mrs. Dorcas's hand-made candlewicks, and is scolded by Grandma and instructed to stay home from work and school until she made this up to Mrs. Dorcas. That night, Thirsey becomes very sick but there is no one to fetch the doctor. Ann, brave as she is, runs through snow and sleet and travels four and a half miles to retrieve the doctor for Thirsey. After recovering from her treacherous journey in the cold, Ann returns home to Grandma and Mrs. Dorcas to find out that Thirsey has been saved. Thinking that Ann saved her baby's life, Mrs. Dorcas is kind to Ann for the rest of her stay with Grandma.

After the death of Samuel Wales, Ann returns home to Mrs. Polly and wants to help her in any way she can. Two gentlemen take the inventory of Samuel Wales‚Äô will, and it proves to be a task that Mrs. Polly can‚Äôt bear. Ann, feeling sorry for Mrs. Polly, steals Samuel's jacket hanging behind the door so it won't be quantified for monetary value like the rest of his belongings. Hearing that the collectors would be very upset if they missed something, Ann rushes to the house of one of them, Mr. Silas White, and presents him with the jacket that he has missed. Shortly after, Grandma passes away and Ann again belongs to Mrs. Polly. Although Ann mourns the death of Grandma, things in Mrs. Polly's house are much better than the last time she left and she can‚Äôt help but cheer up. Over the next couple of years, Ann becomes more of a daughter to Mrs. Polly and less of a servant, and one day Mrs. Polly asks Ann for permission to adopt her. Ann agrees wholeheartedly and her name changes officially from Ann Ginnins to Ann Wales. One night after dinner, Captain French comes to the door of Mrs. Polly's house and asks if either of them have seen Hannah, for she's been missing since she left for her aunt's house the day before. Ann, determined to find her best friend Hannah, heads off towards Bear Swamp to search for her. So she doesn‚Äôt get lost, Ann leaves bits and pieces of wool cards stuck to trees to mark her path. Calling Hannah's name out loud, Ann soon finds Hannah, who had gotten lost in the woods. The two begin to climb out of the woods, but soon Hannah tires too much and can no longer walk. Ann leaves Hannah and rushes to get help. When Ann comes back, she is leading a cow for Ann to ride home. Hannah rides the cow home and is returned to her father. Ann is returned to an overjoyed Mrs. Polly. Characters * Ann Ginnins/Ann Wales * Mrs. Polly Wales * Grandma Wales * Captain French * Hannah French * Mr. Silas White == Themes == In these stories Wilkins deconstructs gender roles and feminist theory while commenting on the realism of the New England society at the time. Some major themes include: * The destructive nature of women * The intricacies of New England village life (Westbrook, 69,70) ** Poverty Stricken ** Lonely and wearisome ** Strangeness of independence within society and the struggle to achieve it * Post-Civil war world of women creating despair in a withering market of men * The aspiration to achieve more within society, both socially and economically (‚ÄúThe Pot of Gold‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Cow With Golden Horns‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Patchwork School‚Äù) * The injustices of the world as perceived by a child (‚ÄúThe Patchwork School‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Bound Girl‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Christmas Monks‚Äù) == Critical reception == Unlike many of Wilkins‚Äô other works, The Pot Of Gold and Other Stories received very little review and critique. Coming at a time where she had just finished one of her more infamous books of short stories, A New England Nun and Other Stories (1891), and was in the process of writing one of her novels, these children's stories seemed to prove unimportant for the scholar reader (Westbrook 33). Perry D. Westbrook says of her children's stories, \\"None of these works are read today, mainly because she created in them no compellingly lifelike characters‚Ä¶Classics for children are even rarer than those for adults‚Äù (Westbrook, 33). In ‚ÄúA Jury of Her Peers‚Äù Elaine Showalter acknowledges that The Pot of Gold received very little attention, stating that ‚Äúhiding submissive material in the category of children‚Äôs literature was one way to escape censure‚Äù (Showalter, 237). In her critique of ‚ÄúThe Patchwork School‚Äù Showalter brings to light Wilkins‚Äô exploration of the destructive nature of women and the issues surrounding the feminist movement (Showalter, 195), highlighting the reform school requiring bad children to complete patchwork tasks that women and girls carried out in their everyday lives (Showalter, 237). ==Sales == In the article ‚ÄúMary Wilkins Freeman: One Hundred Years of Criticism‚Äù Mary Reichardt references the audience of Wilkins's short stories, stating that while her female audience was implied, there was also a widespread male audience as well. Reichardt states, however, that after World War 1, the feminist movement collapsed and the sales of Wilkins's work plummeted (Reichardt, 35). == References == # Foster, Edward. Mary E.

The range of individual and unique differentiated user experiences form a composite impression on the individual which functions as an epistemic form of how we come to know and experience the world and its social, cultural, political and economic realities. In educational settings, social networking pedagogical approaches place social networking technologies at their core, thus presenting expansive opportunities for education to extend the curriculum beyond the traditional walls of educational institutions by reaching into the daily-lived experiences of individuals. The archival features and lack of temporal constraints associated with Internet technologies sustain continually changing currents that educators can connect to student-driven interests by engaging them with trending topics. Through Social Network Pedagogy, educators can develop a teaching praxis where the classroom and social space blend and individuals‚Äô creative contributions are acknowledged for their cultural value. Jones and Huston began theorizing the development of Social Networking Pedagogy during their tenure as doctoral students at the Indiana University School of Education where they were colleagues in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction.

The British Navy Board engaged her to transport convicts from Cork in Ireland to the penal colony of New South Wales in Australia for one voyage from 1800 to 1801. During this voyage she was possibly present, although she did not participate, in a notable action against a squadron of three French frigates. She then made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). ==Origins== Anne was Spanish-built in the 1790s., She was originally named Nostra Senora da Luzet Santa Anna, or Luz St Anne or Luz St Anna.

Her master was James Stewart. For security she was provided with 12 ship's guns and manned by a crew of 42, including additional seamen to act as guards. The British War Office declined a request for a detachment of Marines, citing the burden created by the ongoing war with France. Under the command of James Stewart, on 26 June 1800 Anne sailed from Cork carrying 147 male and 24 female convicts. A little over a month later, on 29 July, Stewart and Annes crew suppressed a mutiny. After consulting with his officers, Stewart had the ringleader of the uprising shot, and another man subjected to 250 lashes. In the affray one convict was killed and some others were wounded. Later, a Vice-Admiralty Court would try Stewart and the Chief Mate, and honourably acquit them.Free Settler or Felon? Convict Ship Anne 1801, - accessed 21 March 2015.

On 3 February, Ndikumana held a press conference to make the allegations public. Ndikumana was arrested by agents of the Anti-Corruption Brigade on 7 February while giving an interview to Radio Publique Africaine. He was then taken before a magistrate of the Anti-Corruption Court, apparently on the basis of a complaint by the Justice Minister. The court charged him under Article 14 of the Anti-Corruption Law with making \\"false declarations\\", which carries a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment and a fine of 1 million Burundian francs (US$716). Ndikumana was then transferred to Mpimba Central Prison in Bujumbura. Ndikumana's detention immediately drew domestic and international criticism. Front Line Defenders expressed concern, stating that Ndikumana's arrest appeared to be \\"motivated by his work against corruption in the judicial system and its impact on access to equitable justice for all citizens\\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, \\"detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression\\", and called for his immediate arrest. The organization also noted its concern that the arrest might have a \\"chilling effect\\" on other activists and journalists. Ten Burundian civil society groups rallied in Bujumbura on 14 February to call for Ndikumana's release, with Gabriel Rufyiri of the Anti-corruption and Economic Malpractice Observatory urging the government to free Ndikumana and become \\"more transparent in recruitment\\". On 17 February, a court rejected Ndikumana's bail plea, ruling that he must remain in prison; however, the court reversed its decision four days later, and he was released on bail on 21 February. Agence France-Presse attributed the about-face to diplomatic pressure on Ndikumana's behalf, particularly from the European Union. As part of Ndikumana's bail terms, he cannot leave the Bujumbura area or travel to the airport, and he must report to the court each Thursday. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Burundi Category:Burundian activists Category:Burundian prisoners and detainees Category:Anti-corruption activists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Faustin Ndikumana"},{"id":"35836203","text":"Dr. Breen's Practice is a novel, one of the earlier works by American author and literary critic William Dean Howells. Houghton Mifflin originally published the novel in 1881 in both Boston and New York. Howells wrote in the realist style, creating a faithful representation of the commonplace, and in this case describing everyday mannerisms that embody the daily lives of middle-class people. ==Plot summary== The story takes place in the late 19th century at Jocelyn's hotel on the beach outside of Newport, Rhode Island, and is told through the voice of a third person narrator. At the hotel croquet court we meet a sickly woman named Louise Maynard and her physician, Dr. Grace Breen. Breen is a graduate of the New York homeopathic school, who has become a doctor to make a difference and prove her worth as a woman. She is cool toward men because the love of her life ran off with her best friend. When Mr. Libby, an old friend of Mrs. Maynard's, asks her to go sailing, Dr. Breen insists it will be bad for her health but Mrs. Maynard to goes anyway. The weather takes a turn for the worst and the boat capsizes in the bitter waters. Mrs. Maynard blames Dr. Breen for allowing her to go out into the storm. After this incident, Mrs. Maynard's condition worsens and she trusts Dr. Breen even less than she did before. She requests a consultation from a male doctor, so Dr. Breen decides to contact Dr. Rufus Mulbridge, a local physician who practices mainstream, conventional medicine. Miss Gleason, another women staying at the hotel, insists that Dr. Breen is the best option for Mrs. Maynard, and that if she calls for a consultation from Dr. Mulbridge she will be making it harder for female physicians to act without a man's assistance. When Dr. Breen arrives at Dr. Mulbridge's office, the reader sees that while he has an established place of business, she works and lives at a hotel, and while he has many patients, she only treats one woman. After relinquishing Mrs. Maynard's case to Dr. Mulbridge, Dr. Breen assumes the role of nurse under his instruction. He diagnoses Mrs. Maynard with pneumonia, Dr. Breen telegraphs Mr. Maynard, who is out in Wyoming working on a ranch, telling him of his wife's condition.‚ÄúDr. Breen's Practice‚Äú. The Spectator, 20 May 1882. Mr. Libby and Dr. Breen take a boat ride to New Leyden to receive a telegraph from Mr. Maynard. Mr. Libby professes his love for Dr. Breen. In spite of his mother's disdain of the professional woman, Dr. Mulbridge also professes his love for Dr. Breen, and proposes to her. However, since he doesn't believe in women's rights or women being able to take men's positions in the world, and he is a mannerless oaf, Mrs. Mulbridge correctly predicts that she will reject him. When Mr. Maynard arrives at Jocelyn's he suggests that Dr. Breen and Mrs. Maynard come out to Wyoming to live with him., where Dr. Breen could have her own practice. However, she decides that she wasted her time training to become a doctor, and that she would rather go to the opera, ballets, and eventually travel to Italy. She professes her love to Mr. Libby, and they walk down the beach in the moonlight together. Dr. Mulbridge comes back to Jocelyn's to again ask Dr. Breen to marry him, but she is now an engaged woman. Grace goes on to marry Mr. Libby and they live in southern New Hampshire near his mills. While Mr. Libby works at the mills, Dr. Breen indulges herself by going to plays and shows in Boston, but she also decides to continue practicing medicine. In the end she has what she originally wanted by practicing medicine, and what she came to love, through her marriage to Mr. Libby. == Characters == *Grace Breen- The protagonist of the story, Dr. Breen is twenty- eight years old; she has brown hair, and is a very handsome young woman. As one of the very few women in the medical profession at the time, she graduated from the New York homeopathic school of medicine. Despite her intellect, she is very uncertain of her life decisions, her personal relationships, and her role within the world around her. *Louise Maynard- Mrs. Maynard is Dr. Breen's one and only patient in the novel. She has a cold and lung problems that are treated over the course of the story. *George Maynard- Mr. Maynard is absent for the majority of the novel, as he and Mrs. Maynard are separated. He works in Cheyenne, Wyoming on a cattle ranch. He has a sense of humor, despite his sad, dull, untrimmed appearance. *Walter Libby- Mr. Libby is a constant presence in the story. He was abroad in Europe with Mr. and Mrs. Maynard, and comes to Jocelyn's, seemingly trying to woo Mrs. Maynard while she is separated from Mr. Maynard. This turns out not to be the case, as he professes his love to Grace. She refuses at first but eventually reciprocates his love. *Rufus Mulbridge- Dr. Mulbridge is the doctor Grace decides to contact when she wants a second opinion on Mrs. Maynard's condition. He is thirty-five years old; he is an intelligent but unattractive, lazy man who dresses in plain clothing. He falls in love with Dr. Breen, but she rejects him. *Mrs. Mulbridge- Mrs. Mulbridge is Dr. Mulbridge's mother and receptionist. An old fashioned woman, she brings a different point of view to the story, professing disdain of professional woman and does not see why a woman (Dr. Breen) should be able to hold the same title as her esteemed son. == Themes == Dr. Breen's Practice is about the rise of women into the medical field in the 19th century and the subsequent decision they had to make between the pursuit of a medical career and the temptation of marriage. In the late 19th century many people doubted that a woman could balance the professional life of a doctor with the more typical path of marriage. Dr. Breen is a great representation of this ethical dilemma. The author, William Dean Howells wrote the first American novel to have a female doctor as the protagonist, and one of the first to have a female doctor mentioned at all. At a time when female doctors were rare, Howells put them at the forefront of his work. In this story, Grace Breen displays little confidence in herself as a physician, and at times regrets having become a doctor. In his essay on ‚ÄúMarriage and the American Medical Woman in Dr. Breen‚Äôs Practice‚Äù, Frederick Wegener quotes Jean Masteller's article, saying ‚ÄúGrace Breen should never have become a physician, since she lacked‚Ä¶the necessary‚Ä¶ temperament to succeed in her rigorous career‚Äù.Wegener, Frederick. \\"Marriage and the American Medical Woman in Dr. Breen's Practice.\\" The Howellsian 10.2 (2007): 4-8. By late 19th century tenets, Dr. Breen marrying Mr. Libby meant she was neglecting her medical career and accepting her fate as just another married woman, but instead she embraces the challenge and does both. William Dean Howells's depiction of the modern female physician challenged the social and gender roles of the time period. == Critical reception == A review in the Atlantic Monthly, ‚ÄúPortrait of a Lady and Dr. Breen‚Äôs Practice‚Äù, stated that William Dean Howells was able to do something not many authors had done, and that was showing people of New England the humor within their uptight lifestyles. This review is glowing with praise; the reviewer describes Howells's writing as delightful and proclaims that not many writers have the ability to create such a strong bond with their readers.The Portrait of a Lady and Dr. Breen's Practice, The Atlantic Monthly; January 1882; Volume 50, No. 1\\"Book Reviews: Howells's Dr. Breen's Practice.\\" The Atlantic Monthly 0049.291 (1882): 128-30.

Lyle, their closer, won the American League Cy Young Award that season, given to the league's best pitcher. However, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner acquired relief pitcher Goose Gossage from the Pittsburgh Pirates that offseason, giving him a larger salary than Lyle's. Though the Yankees wanted to have both Lyle and Gossage work late innings in games, it became apparent that the team would choose Gossage over Lyle in key situations. According to teammate Graig Nettles, Lyle went from \\"Cy Young to sayonara\\". Lyle demanded a trade and a larger salary, but received neither. After the 1978 season, the Yankees traded Lyle to the Texas Rangers.Beaver County Times - Google News Archive Search In the book, Lyle talks about his penchant for practical jokes.

Kalinka Bamberski, a French teenager, died in 1982 in the house of her German stepfather, Dieter Krombach, a doctor and serial rapist. Suspicious autopsy results caused the girl's French father Andr√© Bamberski to pressure German authorities into investigating Krombach's involvement in the death. When Germany closed the case and denied extradition to France, Krombach was tried in absentia in France and convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 1995, a verdict later overturned by the European Court of Human Rights on procedural grounds. In 2009 Bamberski had Krombach abducted in Germany and driven to France. Krombach stood trial there, was convicted in 2011 of having caused intentional bodily harm resulting in unintentional death, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The verdict was appealed, but the European Court of Human Rights upheld it in 2018. A French court gave Bamberski a one- year suspended sentence for the abduction. ==Family background== Andr√© Bamberski was born in France c. 1938; his father's family had come from Poland. During World War II, the Germans took him to Germany and Poland. In the early 1970s, Andr√© Bamberski worked as an accountant. With his wife Dani√®le Gonnin and their two children they lived in Casablanca, Morocco. There they met Dieter Krombach (born 1935) and his second wife; Krombach's first wife had died suddenly at age 24. Krombach worked at the German consulate as a doctor. Krombach and Gonnin began a secret affair and eventually left their partners; they married in 1977. Bamberski's children eventually went to live with the Krombachs in Lindau, Germany. ==Death of Kalinka Bamberski and investigation in Germany== Kalinka Bamberski, a healthy and athletic 14-year- old girl, was attending a French-language boarding school in Germany in 1982. She spent the summer vacation at the home of her mother and her stepfather in Lindau. Krombach stated that on the evening of 9 July 1982 right after dinner he injected her with Kobalt-Ferrlecit, a cobalt-iron preparation that he liked to use on several family members and friends. Initially he said it was intended to aid in tanning, later he contradicted himself and claimed it was intended to treat anemia. He said that he told her to switch off the light at midnight and found her in her room in the morning, dead. He administered various injections intended to revive her; then he called emergency services. He later said that he also had given her a sleeping pill that night. The autopsy, conducted two days later, could not establish a cause of death. Among the findings were: aspirated stomach contents in the airway and lungs, undigested contents in the stomach, several injection marks, a superficial vaginal tear (judged to have occurred after death), fresh bloody stains around the genitals and a whitish substance in the vagina; the substance was not tested. The genitals were removed and have been missing ever since. The prosecutor declined to open a case. Once Bamberski had obtained a copy of the autopsy report, he pressed for another investigation. Additional investigations were ordered in Germany and found that the Kobalt-Ferrlecit injection must have happened very close to Kalinka's death and that Kobalt- Ferrlecit is a dangerous drug that could cause an adverse reaction, but it would do so immediately after injection, not several hours later. The undigested stomach contents pointed to a death soon after a meal; the aspirated stomach contents in the lungs pointed to a death during coma or anesthesia. The expert concluded that the timeline given by Krombach was not convincing and that it was more likely that an injection right after dinner had caused circulatory failure, unconsciousness, vomiting and death. In 1983, Bamberski distributed leaflets in Lindau accusing Krombach of the rape and murder of his daughter. Krombach sued for defamation and received a judgement of 500,000 German Marks which Bamberski refused to pay. Bamberski hired well- known German lawyer Rolf Bossi to press for a trial against Krombach. The case ended before the Oberlandesgericht Munich in 1987 with a finding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Krombach's injection negligently or intentionally caused the girl's death. ==First trial in France== Kalinka's body had been interred in Toulouse and was exhumed in 1985. The genitals could not be found and no new analyses could be performed. An evaluation by French doctors was ordered, which pointed to the poor quality of the original toxicological analyses and concluded that the injection site at the right arm occurred close to death, not several hours before. In 1995, following intense lobbying by Bamberski, Krombach was tried in France in absentia and received a sentence of 15 years in prison for \\"intentionally afflicting of bodily harm which caused unintentional death\\". The verdict was annulled in 2001 by the European Court of Human Rights which censured France because Krombach had not been able to defend himself; Krombach received compensation of 100,000 francs. ==Convictions of Krombach in Germany, further allegations== In the 1970s, Krombach had been investigated in Germany; he was suspected of having killed his wife with an injection. No charges were filed. In a trial in Germany in 1997, Krombach admitted having drugged a 16-year-old patient and raped her in his medical office. He received a two-year suspended sentence and lost his medical license. Several other victims came forward, but the cases were not pursued for lack of physical evidence. In 2006 he was sentenced to 28 months in prison for practicing medicine without a license. The 2006 German TV documentary Kalinkas letzte Reise contains an interview with two teenage sisters who say they were befriended by Krombach, injected with iron cobalt and raped. ==Abduction to France, conviction of Krombach and further proceedings== A German court declined the French authorities' extradition request of Krombach in 2004, stating that the case was closed. Bamberski, concerned that the statute of limitations would run out in 2012, paid several men to abduct Krombach and deliver him to French authorities. On 17 October 2009 Krombach, by then 74 years old, was beaten up by three men in his home town of Scheidegg, Bavaria and driven to Mulhouse, France where he was left chained to a fence near the police station. He suffered a fractured skull. Bamberski was soon arrested with 19,000 Euros he intended to pay to the kidnappers; he was released on bail. Germany demanded Krombach's return to Germany and the extradition of Bamberski and the perpetrators, but France refused. Instead, Krombach was imprisoned and a new trial was scheduled. Testimony of a German woman came to light, who said she had had an affair with Krombach when she was 16 years old; the doctor would drug his wife during their encounters. Several women testified at trial that Krombach had sexually abused them as teenagers, always using cobalt-iron injections. On 22 October 2011, Krombach was sentenced to 15 years in prison, for causing intentional bodily harm resulting in unintentional death. The prosecutors believed that Krombach had drugged Kalinka in order to rape her. The verdict was confirmed on appeal in December 2012. Krombach's lawyer immediately vowed to appeal further to the Court of Cassation, but the appeal was rejected on 2 April 2014. Krombach appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that he had been prosecuted twice for the same crime. The Court rejected the appeal in March 2018, holding that the independent prosecutions in Germany and France were not ruled out by the European Convention on Human Rights. == Case against Bamberski == Germany's demand to have Bamberski extradited to stand trial for the kidnapping was rejected in 2009 by a court in Toulouse with the argument that Bamberski would be tried in France. Bamberski's trial for the kidnapping occurred on May 22 and 23, 2014. He confessed that he had agreed to have Krombach abducted. He was given a one-year suspended jail sentence. == Films == *The 2006 German TV documentary Kalinkas letzte Reise deals with the case. *The 2016 French-German drama film Au nom de ma fille (in English: Kalinka/Bamberski: The Kalinka Case/In Her Name) is based on the case. ==References== Category:1982 crimes in Germany Category:1982 deaths Category:France‚ÄìGermany relations Category:Vigilantism Category:Kidnappings in Germany ","title":"Kalinka Bamberski case"},{"id":"35836324","text":"The Osgood Gamekeeper's Lodge is located along State Highway 133 near Redstone, Colorado, United States. It is a timber frame structure built at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architect Theodore Boal designed the house in the Swiss chalet style, one of many in Redstone at that time. He had been commissioned by John C. Osgood, then owner of the Colorado Fuel and Iron (CFI) company, who designed the small community as a company town for the coal miners and other workers CFI employed in the area. Osgood's estate included two large private game preserves for himself and his guests, who included Theodore Roosevelt, John D. Rockefeller and King Leopold II. Less than a decade after it was built, Redstone was almost completely abandoned. Many of its original houses and cottages were torn down or moved in later decades, even as Redstone itself revived slightly as an arts colony. The gamekeeper's cottage is one of the few outside the village that remain relatively unaltered. It continues to be used as a private residence. ==Buildings and grounds== The lodge is on a complex on the west side of Highway 133, approximately a mile (1.6 km) south of the turnoff to Redstone, at an elevation of above sea level. To the east, across the Crystal River, is Osgood Castle, the main building of the mining magnate's estate. On both sides of the valley steep wooded mountain slopes rise to alpine summits as high as in White River and Gunnison national forests. Much of the neighboring land is undeveloped. To the south is a small subdivision along Chair Mountain Road. A quarter-mile (500 m) to the north is another subdivision. The land along the road is open, giving way to forest further back. There is no development between the highway and the river. An unpaved driveway leads into the property from the road. There are three buildings around its end. The original gamekeeper's lodge is to the north, its carriage house to the west and a modern building to the south. All are sheltered by mature trees, predominantly a mixture of aspen and pine. The lodge building is a one-and-a-half-story timber frame house sided with wooden shingles stained dark brown. It is topped by a clipped-gable roof with broad overhanging eaves pierced by two chimneys near the center. The lower story has a full-length porch on the south (front) facade, complemented by a balcony above it. Both the porch and the balcony have full-length saw-cut wooden balustrades. Two large white brackets support the balcony on either side of the main entrance. Next to them on either side are triple six-over-three double-hung sash windows. The main entrance itself has a white paneled wooden door with six- pane window. Above the brackets two turned spindles rise to the roof. The plainer door to the balcony is flanked by four-over-two double-hung sash. On the east and west elevations, plain brackets support the roof. The carriage house is similar but more restrained. Its eaves are lower, supported by smaller brackets, with the roof pierced by a large shed dormer on the south side. Entrances are located on the sides, with three modern bay windows between them. The east facade has a similar but shorter balustrade along its balcony. ==History== John C. Osgood came to Colorado in 1882 to survey the new state's coal resources for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. He soon established the Colorado Fuel Company to supply it and other railroads with coal mined, initially, by others. His goal was to open mines in the remote Crystal Valley, where he had found high-quality coal suitable for coking during his surveys.Simmons, R. Laurie and Whitacre, Christine; , History Colorado, March 1989, p. 5‚Äì9. Retrieved May 18, 2012. He began buying land in the valley, primarily for the company but also with an eye toward creating an estate for himself. Central to that latter concept was a hunting lodge and game preserves. In 1892 he merged his company with the rival Colorado Coal and Iron Company to form Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I;), which soon became one of the largest mining concerns in the state and indeed the entire West.Simmons and Whitacre, 9‚Äì16. Despite this economic prowess, CF&I; was unable to develop the Crystal Valley at first. In the wake of the Panic of 1893, which hit Colorado's mining sector very hard, banks were unwilling to lend the money to build the necessary railroad connection until the closing years of the century. After that was finished, Osgood began implementing his plans. Like many mine owners of the time, Osgood had a strong dislike for labor unions. He embraced paternal capitalism as an alternative, and planned a company town to be called Redstone, as the center of CF&I;'s operations in the Crystal Valley. After setting up a large coke oven complex, he hired architect Theodore Boal to design both his estate and the town. Influenced by the writings of Andrew Jackson Downing earlier in the century, which had led to the Carpenter Gothic movement and other early Victorian styles that tried to harmonize country houses with their natural setting, Boal built primarily in the Tudor Revival and Swiss Chalet styles, the latter of which finds one of its fullest expressions in Redstone in the gamekeeper's cottage. Both were well-suited to the mountainous surroundings, and Boal adapted them even further to that end. The building's design elements serve both aesthetic and functional purposes. For example, the shingles are as durable as they are rustic and picturesque, per Downing's recommendations. The balcony is not only an element of many actual Swiss chalets, but allowed the gamekeeper to survey the animals in the winter enclosure that would have been before him. In addition to Osgood's hunting lodge, which eventually became his Cleveholm mansion, Boal designed small cottages for the workers and a dormitory for unmarried miners that is today the Redstone Inn, in the same styles. In addition to being high-quality workmanship, in contrast to the makeshift shacks and cabins that dominated most mining camps of the era, the cottages and dormitory had amenities such as electricity and running water that were considered luxuries at the time by any standard. For several years Osgood enjoyed the life he had envisioned for himself two decades before. He made daily rounds in the streets of Redstone to hear from his employees how things were going and resolve their complaints. Both he and his Swedish-born wife Alma, an avid outdoorswoman, took advantage of the ample game on the preserves. Their guests, who frequently accompanied them on their hunting expeditions, included John D. Rockefeller, Theodore Roosevelt and King Leopold II of Belgium. In 1903, interests connected to the Rockefeller family took control of CF&I.; Osgood became less involved in the company and a less frequent presence in the valley he had developed. Six years later, CF&I;'s completion of a new coke plant and economic shifts made Redstone's mines unprofitable, and the town was nearly abandoned within days. Osgood shut down the estate and game preserves in 1913, leaving the few remaining residents to take care of them. The next year the bitter strike that culminated in the Ludlow massacre demonstrated the unsustainability of the paternalist philosophy that had motivated him to build Redstone. In the mid-1920s he returned to the Crystal Valley, terminally ill. After his death in 1926, his ashes were scattered over the valley per his wish. His widow Lucille tried to redevelop the estate into a resort, but its remoteness and the onset of the Great Depression frustrated those hopes. Lucille was forced to sell the property in increments to survive. Some of the original buildings, such as the greenhouses, were moved; others were demolished. The gamekeeper's cottage remained, even after she sold the main estate house itself in the early 1940s. By 1949 the barn had been converted for resort use and cottages were built on the neighboring property. In the 1950s a small log wing was added at the northwest corner. It was joined by a gallery on the lower front in the 1960s. That work also put in new side joists and a concrete foundation. The resort failed, and the house was vacant until 1965, when it reverted to use as a home. Since then Redstone has experienced a slight revival. The gamekeeper's cottage remains largely unaltered other than the work done in the middle of the 20th century. Its current occupants have remodeled the carriage house and rent it out as overnight lodgings. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places in Pitkin County, Colorado ==References *Gamekeeper's Cottage page, with photographs Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado Category:Houses completed in 1901 Category:Redstone, Colorado Category:Houses in Pitkin County, Colorado Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pitkin County, Colorado Category:1901 establishments in Colorado ","title":"Osgood Gamekeeper's Lodge"},{"id":"35836326","text":"blue gum forest in Sydney The Blue Gum High Forest of the Sydney Basin Bioregion is one of six main indigenous forest communities of Sydney, Australia. It has been classified as critically endangered, under the New South Wales government's Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The principal canopy trees in this forest community are Sydney blue gum and blackbutt which are usually seen between 20 and 40 metres tall. 180 species of indigenous plants have been identified at Dalrymple-Hay Nature Reserve. == Distribution == The Blue Gum High Forest is restricted to the northern parts of Sydney, on soils based on shale with an annual rainfall over 1100 mm (43 in). Much of it grew on the ridge tops, roughly following the present day Pacific Highway from around Crows Nest up to Hornsby. Also it was recorded on soils based on the Mittagong Formation, volcanic diatremes and exposed shale lenses within the Hawkesbury Sandstone. Remnants are found as far west as West Pennant Hills and Eastwood, though most of the few remaining areas are in suburbs such as Pymble, Turramurra and Wahroonga. Turiban Reserve in Wahroonga has particuarly tall trees. Two of the larger forest remnants are Dalrymple- Hay Nature Reserve and Sheldon Forest. Around one percent of the original forest remains, and the current remnants amount to an area of 136 hectares (336 acres). Blue Gum High Forest grades into Turpentine-Ironbark Forest in drier areas of lower rainfall. ==Ecological status== Due to fragmentation and the surrounding urban area, the forest remnants are constantly under threat from invasive plant species. Bush regeneration programs have been put in place for many years. Significant species include Wandering Jew, Madeira vine, passionfruit vine, Chinese privet, ochna and camphor laurel.}} == Fauna == Ring-tail possums, sugar gliders, brushtail possums and grey-headed flying foxes are common. There are occasional sightings of wallabies.National Parks & Wildlife Service, info from a Field Officer Birds include rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), Australian king parrot (Alisterus scapularis), crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), currawongs, variegated fairywren (Malurus lamberti), black-faced cuckoo-shrike (Coracina novaehollandiae), superb fairywren (Malurus cyaneus), powerful owl (Ninox strenua), glossy black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami) and silvereyes.

Eneolithic monuments of the steppe Altai were discovered in the foothill zone in the 1970s by B.H. Kadikov, but for a time they remained unrecognized and were classed as Neolithic. The culture has about 50 known monuments with Eneolithic material. Only one cemetery, Large Cape (Bolshoi Mys in Russian), is known so far, and the culture was named for it. The culture is noted for its ceramic vessels with tipped or beet-shaped bottom, thin-walled and thoroughly dressed, later supplanted by more thick-walled round- and flattened-bottom. Vessel ornamentation is dominated by jagged and smooth lines, and comb pattern, sometimes with grid, triangle, and zig-zag decorations. The ornamentation technique is close to that of the Kelteminar monuments of Central Asia and the Afanasevo culture of Altai. In rare cases, vessels have print-comb ornamentation, more typical to the Chalcolithic art of the Eastern Urals and Tumen-Ob region. Thick-walled vessels are sometimes covered with textile patterns, rows of pearls, and rarely pits. The discovery of a metal awl in the remains of a house allowed confident attribution of the Bolshemys complexes to the Eneolithic Age. In the Eneolithic layers, the number of bifaces, arrowheads, and large plates is five to ten times greater compared to the Neolithic layers. Bolshemys people lived in light surface dwellings.Kiryushin, Kirill. Cultural and Chronological Complexes Tytkesken-2 Settlement (in Russian) (2004). Dissertation, Novosibirsk. Retrieved 21 February 2013. Appearance of the Bolshemys monuments in the Middle Katun area is thought to be associated with migration, which caused a complete change of the previous local population, seen in change of ornamental traditions, forms of pottery, and stone tools. The Bolshemys foot hunter economy engaged in hunting of hoofed animals‚Äîroe deer, musk deer, red deer, and Siberian ibex, and mouflon. The population was well adapted to the natural conditions. Settlement location at the junction of highlands and midlands allowed for sustainable agriculture and sufficiently permanent produce. Scientists hold that the Kelteminar culture is related to Pit‚ÄìComb Ware culture and belongs to the Finno-Ugric peoples. However, the archaeological detection in southern Western Siberia of the Neolithic population south-western connections with Bolshemys and Kelteminar cultures is not corroborated by anthropological studies as a migration impulse, and can be explained by the existence in a distant past of common anthropological genetic substrate of the population, which probably preserved intercultural contacts between the offspring cultures. In the Early Metal Period (c. 2000 BC ‚Äì 300 AD) in the southern region of the Western Siberia two core anthropological communities survived, which formed the fabric for the morphological traits of the Early Metal Period population. T.A. Chikisheva defines them anthropologically as Northern Eurasian Anthropological Formation (Uralic type) and Southern Eurasian Anthropological Formation (Altaic type). Studies found anthropological continuity between the people of the Neolithic and Ust-Tartas cultures in the Baraba steppe. Evidence indicates an influx of Bolshemys culture from the Barnaul-Biysk-Ob area or their descendants into the anthropological milieu of Ust-Tartas culture of the Baraba province. The obvious migratory impulses of animal husbandry population from the Middle East or Middle Asia from the south to the territory of the Altai Mountains are traced by the anthropological markers starting after 2000 BC, and increasing in the Early Nomads Era (2000‚Äì1 BC). In the Early Bronze Age (3200‚Äì2300 BC), the population of the Baraba steppe retained capacity of the indigenous anthropological substrate, having assimilated the migrant Bolshemys Culture. The Ust-Tartas Culture, in turn, was replaced by the anthropological complex of the Odinov culture, and later by Krotov culture, with the anthropological composition of the population containing only autochthonous morphological complex.Chikisheva, Tatiana.

From that time, other than wells completed in water- drive reservoirs, they decline in production, the rapidity of decline depending on the output of the wells and on other factors governing their productivity. The production decline curve shows the amount of oil and gas produced per unit of time for several consecutive periods; if the conditions affecting the rate of production are not changed, the curve may be fairly regular, and, if projected, will furnish useful knowledge as to the future production of the well.

This trait thus correlates highly with a fantasy-prone personality. The original research on absorption was by American psychologist Auke Tellegen. The construct of absorption was developed in order to relate individual differences in hypnotisability to broader aspects of personality. Absorption has a variable correlation with hypnotisability (r = 0.13‚Äì0.89) perhaps because in addition to broad personality dispositions, situational factors play an important role in performance on tests of hypnotic susceptibility. Absorption is one of the traits assessed in the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire. == Measurement == Absorption is most commonly measured by the Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS). Several versions of this scale are available, the most recent being by Graham Jamieson, who provides a copy of his modified scale. The TAS comprises nine content clusters or subscales: * responsiveness to engaging stimuli * responsiveness to inductive stimuli * imagistic thought * ability to summon vivid and suggestive images * cross-modal experiences‚Äîe. g.: synesthesia * absorption in thoughts and imaginings * vivid memories of the past * episodes of expanded awareness * altered states of consciousness A 1991 study by Glisky et al. concluded that responsiveness to the engaging or inductive stimuli subscales of the TAS were more strongly related to hypnotisability than were imagistic thought, episodes of expanded awareness, or absorption in thoughts and imaginings. A revised version of the TAS has been included in Tellegen's Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) in which it is considered both a primary and a broad trait. In the MPQ, absorption has two subscales called \\"sentient\\" and \\"prone to imaginative and altered states\\" respectively. Tellegen has assigned copyright of TAS to the University of Minnesota Press (UMP). It was generally believed from the 1990s that the TAS was now in the public domain, and various improved versions were circulated. However, recently the UMP has reasserted its copyright, and regards these later versions to be unauthorised, and also disputes whether these versions are in fact improvements. ==Relationship to other personality traits== Absorption is strongly correlated with openness to experience. Studies using factor analysis have suggested that the fantasy, aesthetics, and feelings facets of the NEO PI-R Openness to Experience scale are closely related to absorption and predict hypnotisability, whereas the remaining three facet scales of ideas, actions, and values are largely unrelated to these constructs. Absorption is unrelated to extraversion or neuroticism. One study found a positive correlation between absorption and need for cognition. Absorption has a strong relationship to self-transcendence in the Temperament and Character Inventory. ==Emotional experience== Absorption can facilitate the experience of both positive and negative emotions. Positive experiences facilitated by absorption include the enjoyment of music, art, and natural beauty (e.g. sunsets) and pleasant forms of daydreaming. Absorption has also been linked to forms of maladjustment, such as nightmare frequency and anxiety sensitivity (fear of one's own anxiety symptoms), and dissociative symptoms. Absorption may act to amplify minor somatic symptoms, leading to an increased risk of conditions associated with hypersensitivity to internal bodily sensations, such as somatoform disorders and panic disorder. People may have a particular risk of the aforementioned problems when they are prone to both high absorption and to personality traits associated with negative emotionality. ==Altered states of consciousness== A core feature of absorption is an experience of focused attention wherein: \\"objects of absorbed attention acquire an importance and intimacy that are normally reserved for the self and may, therefore, acquire a temporary self-like quality. These object identifications have mystical overtones.\\" This capacity for focused attention facilitates the experience of altered states of consciousness. In addition to individual differences in hypnotizability, absorption is associated with differential responses to other procedures for inducing altered states of consciousness, including meditation, marijuana use, and biofeedback. A review of studies on differential response to the drug psilocybin found that absorption had the largest effect of all the psychological variables assessed on the intensity of individual experiences of altered states of consciousness. Absorption was strongly associated with overall consciousness alteration and with mystical-type experiences and visual effects induced by psilocybin. Researchers have suggested that individual differences in both absorption and responsiveness to hallucinogenic drugs could be related to the binding potential of serotonin receptors (specifically 5-HT2A) which are the main site of action of classic hallucinogens, such as LSD and psilocybin. ===Dream recall=== Research has found that frequency of dream recall is associated with absorption and related personality traits, such as openness to experience and proneness to dissociation. A proposed explanation is the continuity model of human consciousness. This model proposes that people who are prone to vivid and unusual experiences during the day, such as fantasy and daydreaming, will tend to have vivid and memorable dream content, and hence will be more likely to remember their dreams. ==See also== * Boundaries of the mind * Depersonalization and derealization * Fantasy prone personality * Fantasy (psychology) * Flow (psychology) * Paracosm * Suggestibility ==References== Category:Personality traits Category:Hypnosis ","title":"Absorption (psychology)"},{"id":"35836490","text":"The Institut de tourisme et d'h√¥tellerie du Qu√©bec on Saint Denis Street near Saint-Louis Square in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal.

He grew up in Bremen, Georgia, and went on to attend the University of Georgia before transferring to the Georgia Institute of Technology; he initially hoped to study to become an architect, but later changed his course of study to journalism. He registered for the Selective Service System and was given a II-S student deferment. He married Margaret Elizabeth Thompson of Atlanta on November 6, 1966. In January or February 1967, he withdrew from university. He attempted to obtain 1-O conscientious objector status, but was denied, and was instead classified 1-A (available for induction). After twice being ordered to report for induction, he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in February 1967 and charged with violating the Selective Service Act. He then crossed the border into Canada with his American wife, obtained landed immigrant status there (though not Canadian citizenship), and in May went to the United States Consulate in Toronto and renounced his citizenship. His oath of renunciation was signed before U.S. Consul Richard J. Dols. ==Deportation case== Jolley later returned to the United States, apparently via Detroit. He then went south and began working as a news reporter for the Tallahassee Democrat in Tallahassee, Florida, while his wife enrolled in graduate school at Florida State University. After the news of his situation went public, Democrat managing editor William Phillips, who made the decision to hire Jolley, commented that the paper had received equal numbers of letters of support and hate mail for its decision not to fire Jolley. The U.S. government ordered Jolley deported, but he did not depart the country voluntarily, and so on February 22, 1968, he was again arrested by FBI agents. He was released on a $3,000 bond pending formal deportation proceedings against him. U.S. media described him as a \\"draft evader\\". Others called him a \\"modern-day Philip Nolan\\", a reference to the main character of the American Civil War short story The Man Without a Country. Represented by attorney Peter Rindskopf, Jolley appealed his case to the Board of Immigration Appeals in April 1969, but the Board ruled against him in March 1970. He appealed again to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which in April 1971 also ruled against him. The court struck down his argument that his renunciation was involuntary because he was being forced into military service, instead ruling that it indeed constituted voluntary relinquishment within the meaning of Afroyim v. Rusk. However, Richard Rives wrote a dissenting opinion arguing that the U.S. government should allow Jolley's appeal and prosecute him for draft evasion instead. Jolley attempted to appeal the Fifth Circuit's ruling to the Supreme Court, but not a single justice recommended granting certiorari, meaning the Court would not hear his case. After this news came out, Jolley stated that he would not pursue further any further legal actions. ==Aftermath== Jolley was thus declared deportable, but before he could be deported, another country would have to be found to accept him. A spokesman for the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada stated that Jolley may have lost his landed immigrant status due to his long absence from Canada, but he could apply for immigration permission again at a Canadian port of entry. Jolley was given 90 days to voluntarily depart the country, failing which the government would commence removal proceedings on February 7, 1972, but in January that year, Representatives Phillip Burton and Ron Dellums (both D-CA) sponsored separate private bills to grant a green card to Jolley, and the House Committee on the Judiciary asked the Department of Justice to provide a full report about Jolley. The removal process was suspended while the bill was under consideration. The following year, Dellums sponsored another private bill to the same effect, but no further action was taken on it. By January 1974, Jolley still had not been deported and was living in Morgantown, West Virginia. The Los Angeles Times reported that \\"Canada, which has no legal obligation to take Jolley back, does not want him back\\", and quoted an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman as stating that the government had \\"no choice but to let him live here\\". With no country to which he could be deported, it was expected that he might spend the rest of his life living in the United States as a deportable alien. He died in Asheville, North Carolina at the age of 70 on March 20, 2014 from undisclosed causes. ==References== Category:1944 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American anti‚ÄìVietnam War activists Category:American emigrants to Canada Category:Vietnam War draft evaders Category:People from Greensboro, North Carolina Category:People who lost United States citizenship Category:Stateless people Category:Disease-related deaths in North Carolina Category:People from Bremen, Georgia Category:Activists from North Carolina ","title":"Thomas Jolley"},{"id":"35836508","text":"Duke Xi of Qi (; died 698 BC) was from 730 to 698 BC the thirteenth recorded ruler of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China.

He is known for solo hits and collaborations with various artists. He rose to fame after his collaboration with Spanish DJ and producer Jose de Rico which launched him internationally with dance hits like \\"Te fuiste\\", \\"Rayos de sol\\", and \\"Noche de estrellas\\". His renditions have been included in several Latin dance compilations and his songs are played in Europe, Latin America and internationally. He is signed to Flow Records BCN label. ==Career== Born in Santo Domingo, M√©ndez was interested in music and dance very early as a child and as a teenager performing at various locations with youth groups. He immigrated to Spain residing in the district of Sant Pere, Tordera near Barcelona, where he began a music career professionally with collaborations especially with the singer and friend OPB (Ollantay P√©rez Betancourt). In 2002, he founded his own \\"Latino Way\\" record label with a record deal with Filmax Music, launching on a big tour of more than 100 dates throughout Spain, creating a fan base. He appeared with well-known Spanish artists like David DeMar√≠a, David Bustamante, Chenoa, Guaran√°, Presuntos Implicados amongst others. Songs from this period include \\"Sigue Bailando\\", \\"Mami\\", \\"Yo soy tu maestro\\" and \\"Ven\\" achieving good sales throughout his tour. His songs were also included in various hit compilations like El Disco de Reggaeton 02 (Vale Music), Caribe Mix (Blanco y Negro Music), El Megat√≥n (Filmax Music) and La Factoria del Reggaeton (Metropol Records) etc. With increasing appeal of dancehall music internationally, M√©ndez signed with Sony BMG in Spain for launching urban dancehall sounds and early 2008 created his own independent label in partnership with Ollantay P√©rez releasing songs like \\"Yo S√≠ Soy de Barrio\\", \\"Traigo Candela\\" and others alongside music videos for the releases for better exposure on music channels in Spain. He also branched with his friend Ollantay P√©rez Betancourt to Sheneal Records led by Carlos L√≥pez da Silva with renowned music video producer Eklipse. He also managed to forge collaborations with other Dominican and regional Spanish performers throughout his tours with OPB with titles like \\"La sonrisa del gato\\", \\"Chica tentadora\\" and \\"Fuego pasi√≥n\\". He also increasingly adopted European disco sounds for wider appeal, without forgetting the Latin American markets, where he toured initially with Ecuadorian rapper and reggaetone act Rude School. His releases became increasingly popular in Latin America (Ecuador, Colombia, Chile) and as far as Cuba in addition to his homeland, the Dominican Republic. ;National and international fame 2011 saw a huge increase in popularity of Henry M√©ndez after signing with Roster Music, a big name in Spanish dance music and collaboration with Spanish DJ and music producer Jos√© de Rico. The release of \\"Te fuiste\\" (credited to Jos√© de Rico and Henry M√©ndez) resulted in a huge commercial appeal and dance hit specially with the catchy music video launched for the song. Almost simultaneously the dance hit \\"Rayos de sol\\" (credited to Jose de Rico featuring Henry M√©ndez) was launched reaching number 2 in Spain and an international hit charting in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland. It became the third best selling single in Spain in 2012. A third 2012 big hit in the series of Mendez international hits came with \\"Noche de estrellas\\" (credited to Jos√© de Rico & Henry M√©ndez featuring Jay Santos). Henry M√©ndez has continued to enjoy commercial success with his solo single \\"Mi reina\\" that reached number 5 in Spanish PROMUSICAE Singles Chart and the follow up \\"El tibur√≥n (The Shark)\\", a remake of a popular merengue tune by Proyecto Uno. ==DiscographySingles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of singles, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"8\\"  Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Certifications ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" AUT AustrianCharts.com Henry Mendes discography (Austria) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" BEL (Vl) Ultratop.be Henry Mendes discography (Belgium (Vlanders)) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" BEL (Wa) BelgianCharts.com Henry Mendes discography (Belgium (Wallonia)) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" FRA LesCharts.com Henry Mendez discography (France) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" GER ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\\" SPA SpanishCharts.com Henry Mendez discography (Spain) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" SWI swissCharts.com Henry Mendes discography (Switzerland) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" VE - rowspan=\\"3\\" 2012 ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Te fuiste\\" (Jose de Rico & Henry Mendez)  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  62  ‚Äî  34\\"Te fuiste\\" page  ‚Äî  ‚Äî   - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Rayos de sol\\" (Jose de Rico feat.

The diameter of a set of moving points is the maximum distance between any pair of points in the set. In the two dimensional case, the kinetic data structure for kinetic convex hull can be used to construct a kinetic data structure for the diameter of a moving point set that is responsive, compact and efficient. ==2D Case== The pair of points with maximum pairwise distance must be one of the pairs of antipodal points of the convex hull of all of the points. Note that two points are antipodal points if they have parallel supporting lines. In the static case, the diameter of a point set can be found by computing the convex hull of the point set, finding all pairs of antipodal points, and then finding the maximum distance between these pairs. This algorithm can be kinetized as follows: Consider the dual of the point set. The points dualize to lines and the convex hull of the points dualizes to the upper and lower envelope of the set of lines. The vertices of the upper convex hull dualize to segments on the upper envelope. The vertices of the lower convex hull dualize to segments on the lower envelope. The range of slopes of the supporting lines of a point on the hull dualize to the x-interval of segment that point dualizes to. When viewed in this dualized fashion the antipodal pairs, are pairs of segments, one from the upper envelope, one from the lower, with overlapping x ranges. Now, the upper and lower envelopes can be viewed as two different x-ordered lists of non overlapping intervals. If these two lists are merged, the antipodal pairs are the overlaps in the merged list. The overlaps in the merged list of x-intervals can be maintained by storing the endpoints of the intervals in a kinetic sorted list. When points swap, the list of antipodal pairs are updated. The upper and lower envelopes can be maintained using the standard data structure for kinetic convex hull. The maximum distance between pairs of antipodal can be maintained with a kinetic tournament. Thus, using kinetic convex hull to maintain the upper and lower envelopes, a kinetic sorted list on these intervals to maintain the antipodal pairs, and a kinetic tournament to maintain the pair of maximum distance apart, the diameter of a moving point set can be maintained. This data structure is responsive, compact and efficient. The data structure uses O(n) space because the kinetic convex hull, sorted list, and tournament data structures all use O(n) space. In all of the data structures, events, inserts, and deletes can be handled in O(\\\\log^2 n) time, so the data structure are responsive, requiring O(\\\\log^2 n) per event. The data structure is efficient because the total number of events is O(n^{2+\\\\epsilon}) for all \\\\epsilon>0 and the diameter of a point set can change \\\\Omega(n^2) times, even if the points are moving linearly. This data structure is not local because one point may be in many antipodal pairs, and thus appear many times in the kinetic tournament. The existence of a local kinetic data structure for diameter is open. ==Higher Dimensions== Efficiently maintaining the kinetic diameter of a point set in dimensions higher than 2 is an open problem. Efficient kinetic convex hull in dimensions higher than 2 is also an open problem. ==Related Problems== *Kinetic width *Kinetic minimum box == References == P. K. Agarwal, L. J. Guibas, J.

The bridge lies within San Onofre State Beach and gave its nickname to the famed Trestles surfing site at that beach..... ==Usage== The bridge, carrying a single railway track, forms part of the only northern rail connection out of San Diego and part of the LOSSAN Corridor, the second busiest segment of railway in the United States. Approximately 45 trains per day and 2.7 million people per year travel on the bridge; it is used by Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner trains, the Orange County Line of the Metrolink commuter rail service, and freight trains on the BNSF Railway.. ==History== A railroad first bridged the creek in this location in 1891. In 1941, a wooden trestle bridge long was built in this location. The nearby waves had already been surfed as early as 1937, and by 1951, local surfers had named the beach and its surf break \\"Trestles\\", after the bridge there.. In 1992, the railway line containing the bridge was purchased by the North County Transportation District from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Storms caused by the El Ni√±o of 1998 damaged the bridge, leading a center section of the bridge long to be replaced by concrete and leaving separated wooden sections long in the south and long in the north.. By 2007, inspectors determined that the northern segment of the bridge needed replacement. Salt from the beach environment had rotted the wooden support beams, they had been damaged by fires set by beachgoers, the creosote protecting the beams had been worn away, and the bridge did not meet seismic standards. Trains could not travel on the bridge at full speeds, and frequent bridge maintenance was costing US$250,000 per year... Construction began in 2010,. and a new concrete replacement for this bridge segment opened in 2012 at a cost of eight million dollars, paid by federal funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.. ==Design== In order to protect the 2012 bridge segment against corrosion, its rebar was protected by an epoxy coating and calcium nitrite was added as a corrosion inhibitor to its reinforced concrete.. See in particular example 4.2, San Mateo Creek Rail Bridge 207.6, pp. 195‚Äì196. The new concrete supports for the bridge structure are etched with letters spelling \\"Trestles\\", the nickname of the bridge. ==References== Category:Bridges in San Diego County, California Category:Railroad bridges in California Category:Bridges completed in 1941 Category:Concrete bridges in California Category:Wooden bridges in California Category:Trestle bridges in the United States ","title":"Trestles Bridge"},{"id":"35836757","text":"Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson (died 1265) was King of Mann and the Isles.

The book was published on May 8, 2012 by Simon & Schuster, and deals with the coming of age of a bisexual man and his coming to grips with his sexual identity. ==Synopsis== In One Person is narrated by central character Billy, a bisexual novelist. Billy's story is told through multiple time periods and shows him initially as a teenager with crushes on the \\"wrong people,\\" but also shows his coming of age. ==Background== Irving came up with the idea of writing a book about a bisexual character while thinking \\"what if,\\" also commenting that the subject matter of bisexuality was familiar to him, having had fleeting crushes on boys while growing up. He also remarked on the subject of the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s when he wrote that he and several family members of homosexual men had only discovered the sexual orientation of these men due to their being diagnosed as having the disease and dying of it. Irving has stated that while it had taken him seven to eight years to conceptualize the book, he felt that the novel's actual writing process was relatively fast and that due to his experiences in New York, did not have to do as much research. ==Themes== In One Person deals with several themes such as homosexuality, bisexuality, and AIDS. Other elements mentioned in the book concern transgenderism and the idea of sexual awakening. ==Reception== Critical reception for In One Person was mixed to positive. Prevalent criticisms of the book centered on the usage of the character of Billy as a way of discussing various themes and issues, with The Telegraph saying that \\"Bill Abbott ultimately proves better at discussing Irving‚Äôs themes than at embodying them.\\" A reviewer for The A.V. Club criticized that women in the novel were predominantly portrayed as \\"hateful, bigoted shrews,\\" but praised In One Person as having several strengths such as the novel's conclusion. Praise for the novel also centered on the book's humor and the character of Billy. The book was a co-winner with Cheryl Burke's My Awesome Place: The Autobiography of Cheryl B in the Bisexual Literature category at the 2013 Lambda Literary Awards. ==References *Official author website * Category:2012 American novels Category:Novels by John Irving Category:Novels with bisexual themes Category:Novels with transgender themes Category:Lambda Literary Award-winning works Category:Male bisexuality in fiction Category:American LGBT novels Category:2010s LGBT novels ","title":"In One Person"},{"id":"35836866","text":"El Pac√≠fico- Compa√±√≠a de Seguros y Reaseguros S.A. or Pacifico Seguros () is a leading insurance and reinsurance company in Peru and one of the largest in Latin America.

In the second round he met Damir Keretiƒá, who he had beaten two weeks earlier in Florence, but on this occasion proved too strong for Tiberti in a five setter. At the 1983 French Open he again faced Keretic, this time in a first round match, which he lost in four sets. On tour he had his best ever showing in 1982, at the Swedish Open, where he reached the semi-finals with wins over Thierry Tulasne, Jonathan Smith and Carl-Axel Hageskog. He was defeated by a young Mats Wilander in his semi- final.Vancouver Sun, \\"Purcell advances against Vilas\\", 19 July 1982. He had a good year playing doubles in 1986, finishing runner-up at two Grand Prix events, the Copa Banco Galacia (Buenos Aires) and Geneva Open.

In the early episodes, the cast joked that their primary aim was not to disturb the ratings of sister segment 2 Days & 1 Night. The original cast included the main MC Lee Kyung- kyu, who made his comeback into the Korean TV industry with this show; Kim Gook-jin, a comedian who previously attempted to become a professional golfer; Kim Tae-won, leader of the legendary rock-ballad band Boohwal; Lee Yoon-seok, a comedian known for his doctor's degree and conversely his ridiculously weak strength (though since joining the show, Kim Tae-won took over his title of \\"Weakling of the nation\\"); Yoon Hyung-bin, a comedian from the show Gag Concert; and actors Lee Jung-jin and Kim Sung-min. The cast went through a variety of physically and emotionally taxing missions, usually spanning over 24 hours, performing the likes of serving mandatory military service again, crying, becoming employees of random companies, not smoking for a day, wake- boarding, singing in a choir, participating in an amusement park parade show, and forming an amateur band. The most memorable moment for the program was when 2 of the members (Kim Gook-jin and Kim Sung-min) was selected as a guest for the United States Air Force Thunderbirds Acrobatic Team, during their 2009 Far East Tour at Osan Air Base, in South Korea. For the Choir episodes, both of the Choir teams won awards (with guest Kolleen Park and Kim Tae-won as conductors). In late 2010, Kim Sung-min was dropped from the program after being arrested for drug use. He was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months in prison for meth use and smuggling, suspended for 4 years. On April 10, 2011, Korean baseball legend Yang Joon-hyuk (he currently holds the records for home runs, RBI, and best batting average) made his debut as a member of the show. On May 8, 2011, Lee Jung-jin appeared in his final episode and Jun Hyun-moo became the newest and 7th member of the show. Jun is a KBS news announcer and reporter known for his variety and comedic skills (particularly for his parody of SHINee's \\"Lucifer\\" dance). On July 31, 2012, Yang Joon-hyuk and Jun Hyun- moo left the show, and 2 new members‚Äîactor Joo Sang-wook and Gag Concert comedian Kim Jun-ho‚Äîjoined the crew. Qualifications of Men initially maintained good ratings; in 2009, it placed second among the most viewed Sunday night programs for 16 weeks with more than 30% viewership ratings.\\"'1Î∞ï2Ïùº' ÌòπÌïúÍ∏∞ ÌäπÏßë Ìö®Í≥º ÌÜ°ÌÜ°!

With its cancellation, the show's raison d'√™tre was unfinished, with the program coming to a close before the cast members were able to finish filling out the list of 101 things, only getting up to #94. ==Broadcasting times== {  - !

He has won $246,963 in tournament winnings over the course of his StarCraft 2 career, and has won three GOMTV Global Starcraft II League (GSL) tournaments, the second-most of any player, just behind teammate Jung \\"Mvp\\" Jong Hyun who has four titles. ==History2010=== NesTea was one of the top ranked Zerg players on the Korean ladder shortly after the launch of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. He managed to qualify for the very first GOMTV Global Starcraft II League, but his tournament run met a quick end when he got knocked out in the first round by LiveForever. His opponent eventually went on to finish in 3rd/4th place. In late September 2010, NesTea, together with Mvp, TT, ChRh, and LosirA, founded the team IM - \\"Incredible Miracle\\". All of these team members were former Brood War players. However, in season 2 of the GOMTV Global Starcraft II League he went much further in the tournament than his previous run. He did not drop a single set until the final's; a record that was only broken by himself in a later season where he won the tournament without dropping a single map. He ended up winning season 2 by defeating Boxer (who changed his name to Marineking) 4-3. ===2011=== NesTea kept up with his impressive performance when his team Incredible Miracle reached the finals of GOMTV Global Starcraft II Team League. They were up against Startale and were tied 4-4 in the best of seven, NesTea was chosen for the ace match and won his game carrying his team to the first ever GSTL win. When Code S and Code A were introduced into the GSL it was a rocky start for NesTea. Losing to MVP in the semifinals of the first Code S and then being taken down to the up and down matches (this is used to determine how moves up and down between Code A and Code S) in the second season of the new GSL. He however bounced back getting right back into Code S. In May he advanced from his group only losing one game and proceeded to reach the finals of the GSL once again. He met InCa in the finals and easily took the game 4-0 to claim yet another GSL win. In July NesTea beat the record that he had set for the cleanest tournament by not losing a single game in the whole tournaments and taking the finals 4-0. This record has never been met again by anyone including NesTea. In August, NesTea beat Kyrix in the group stages and lost against MMA, which ended NesTea's massive GSL win streak. He advanced from his group to the Round of 16 by winning a close match against his teammate Happy. Unfortunately, his next opponent was once again his teammate and rival, Mvp, whom he lost to 0-2. In October, NesTea was once again in a group with MMA. However, this time, NesTea managed to advance through his group by defeating both MMA and NaDa. He then defeated Virus 2-1 in the Round of 16, but lost in the Round of 8 to Mvp in a close (2-3) series. NesTea struggled a bit during the initial stages of the 2011 GSL November. He was able to advance out of the Round of 32 by defeating his teammate LosirA, but he then lost 0-2 in the Round of 16, sending him into Code A. In the 2012 GSL Season 1 Code S Round of 32, NesTea was seeded into a group with Mvp, Lucky, and IdrA. He defeated IdrA 2-0 and Mvp 2-1 to continue into the Round of 16. NesTea would lose 2-1 against both DongRaeGu and Genius to fall down to Code A as last in his group. NesTea was only in Code A for a brief period, he played one game against asd and beat him 2-0 reclaiming his Code S spot. NesTea was invited to his first major foreign tournament when he got invited to BlizzCon 2011. He reached the finals where he had to verse he teammate MVP in an extended series due to the fact that he had beat him in the winners bracket prior to the finals. He lost 2 best of 3's to MVP leaving him in 2nd place. After BlizzCon 2011 NesTea went to MLG Providence. He ended up in 12th place losing to Haypro and NaNiwa. His lose to NaNiwa created a new rivalry between the 2 players that would come back often in events in and out of Korea. ===2012=== In 2012 NesTea participated in many foreign tournaments and achieved high rankings in these tournaments. He participated in the Iron Squid tournament, a tournament hosted in Paris, France. He went to the US for the IGN Pro League and for the 2012 MLG Winter Qualifier Korea. When he participated in the Iron Squid tournament he was in group D with aLive, Nerchio, Leenock and HasuObs. He advanced from his group without dropping a set and proceeded to the open bracket. He went up against Jjakji in the quarterfinals and beat him 3-2 in the best of 5. He then lost to Symbol 3-1 in the semifinals droping him down to the 3rd place decider match where he would face aLive. He defeated aLive 3-2 to claim 3rd place in the tournament and claiming $3,750. ===2014=== In 2014 NesTea became a free agent. ==Trivia== * He is the first player to win three GSL championships. * He is the first and only player to win a GSL without dropping a single game. (July 2011).

The most commonly used grip is the orthodox forehand grip. Most players change grips during a rally depending on whether it is a forehand or backhand shot. A grip is also the wrapping around the handle of the racket. There are many types and varieties of grips; the texture, thickness, color, material and surface (flat or waved) are all factors that make grips unique. ==Forehand grip== In order to understand the grips, it is important to know that the handle of a racquet always consists of 8 sides, or in other words, has an octagonal shape. A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called levels. The levels can be numbered from 1 to 8; with the racquet surface perpendicular to the ground, the bevels are numbered from the top anti-clockwise. So bevel 1 would be the narrow bevel at the 'North' position, bevel 2 would be the diagonal bevel at the 'Northwest' position, etc. The badminton handle should be held as if the player was lightly shaking hands with it. For right handed players, the right bottom side of the thumb should be touching the 3rd bevel while the left side of the index finger should be resting on the 7th level. The index finger rests on the 7th bevel above the adjacent location of the thumb on the 3rd level. The finger is shaped like a hook and holds onto the handle near the top section. The other fingers are wrapped around the lower sections of the handle. ==Backhand grip== The backhand grip, also known as the thumb grip, is similar to the forehand grip except the complete bottom of the thumb is in contact with the 3rd bevel and the index finger is lowered down to a position below the thumb. ==Benefits and limitations of grip positions== Here is a table contrasting the benefits and limitations of using certain grips in certain situations. {  style=\\"text-align:center; width:80%;\\" + Benefits and Limitations of Grip Positions - - Benefits Limitations - Using the forehand grip is beneficial as it reduces strain on the wrist and arm. Using the backhand grip during a backhand shot increases power as the thumb provides substantial energy to the racquet. - More powerful smashes Clears are too short, smashes are weak - More accurate net shots and serves Limited choice for the direction of your strokes - Stronger smash defense, ready to return smash on both sides Difficulty coping when opponents hit towards your body - Deceptive Strokes Obvious stokes that your opponent can predict - } ==Types of gripsUnderlying Grip (undergrip)=== The underlying grip or the undergrip, is a layer of thin wrapping of synthetic leather that is wrapped around the bare handle of the racquet. All badminton racquets come with the undergrip and it is recommended that it is not removed. It is advised for players to apply an overgrip over the undergrip for normal use/play. ===Waved=== The waved badminton grip is a type of grip that has foam strips in the center of the grip wrap so that after the grip is applied, there will be 'grooves' on the grip that can help increase friction and comfort when holding the racquet. The only slight disadvantage of waved grips is that is slightly heavier than flat grips due to the excess foam for the grooves. ===Flat=== The Eastern Backhand grip is obtained when placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger and heel of the hand are right on the 1st bevel. This is essentially the same as the Western forehand grip and allows for significant spin and control.

It is the center of commerce and finance, culture, sport and entertainment in the Republic. Saransk is a very clean and green city with a lot of squares. There are 4 main squares in the city center - Kommunisticheskaya Square, Sovetskaya Square, Privokzalnaya Square and Square of Victiory. ==Sovetskaya Square== Sovetskaya squarehttp://www.saransk-online.info/sight/4/06/ - –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥—å(Russian) is the main square in Saransk. It is located in the center of the city on Sovetskaya street, at the crossroads of Tolstoy street, Volodarsky street, Moskovskaya street and Lenin Prospect. The square was made in the middle of 17th century. The place has had various names during different periods of time - Sobornaya (Cathedral Square), Sobornaya-Torgovaya (Cathedral and Trade Square), Bazarnaya (Market Square) and Verhne-Bazarnaya (Upper-Market Square). The first name is dated to the time when Saransk was founded. In Russian tradition every church was supposed to have a square beside it, so Sobornaya Square was made next to the church on the hill. In 1852 a great part of Saransk burnt down and many churches were destroyed. After a while a tradesman Ivan Krotkov started the construction of a new one. It took a long time to build it and many townspeople supported him financially. The Spassky Cathedral was finally finished in 1885 looking after Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow. A new Sobornaya square became bigger including two other minor squares - Rozhdestvenskaya (Christmas Square) and Bazarnaya (Market Square). In the second half of the 19th century the large area in Bazarnaya Street was called Sobornaya, Rozhdestvenskaya and Bazarnaya squares.http://mordovia.drugiegoroda.ru/24- sovetskaya ploshhad goroda saranska/ in the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century, the number of sales outlets, new buildings and houses were built on the square. The name \\"Bazarnaya Square\\" became commonly used. After the Revolution the oldest city square was renamed into Revolution Square. It became the main place to hold public events, demonstrations, meetings, processions and the Red Army parades in Saransk. The modern name of the square, Sovetskaya Square, has been used since 1919. ==Kommunisticheskaya Square== Kommunisticheskaya Squarehttp://www.saransk-online.info/sight/4/03/ - –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥—å(Russian) is located between Bolshevistskaya street, Kommunisticheskaya street and Lenin Prospect.

Maintaining a kinetic triangulation is important for applications that involve motion planning, such as video games, virtual reality, dynamic simulations and robotics. ==Choosing a triangulation scheme== The efficiency of a kinetic data structure is defined based on the ratio of the number of internal events to external events, thus good runtime bounds can sometimes be obtained by choosing to use a triangulation scheme that generates a small number of external events. For simple affine motion of the points, the number of discrete changes to the convex hull is estimated by \\\\Omega(n^2), thus the number of changes to any triangulation is also lower bounded by \\\\Omega(n^2). Finding any triangulation scheme that has a near-quadratic bound on the number of discrete changes is an important open problem. ===Delaunay triangulation=== The Delaunay triangulation seems like a natural candidate, but a tight worst-case analysis of the number of discrete changes that will occur to the Delaunay triangulation (external events) was considered an open problem until 2015; it has now been bounded to be between \\\\Omega(n^2) and O(n^{2+\\\\epsilon}).

Currently, he is Russel H. Morgan Professor of Radiology and Director of the Division of MR Research at Johns Hopkins University, with ~200 peer-reviewed journal articles, almost 50 U.S patents and is a Founder and past member of the Board of Directors of MRI Interventions, Inc MRI Interventions, formerly known as SurgiVision Inc. ==Work== Born in Melbourne, Australia, Bottomley earned a BSc in Physics from Monash University in 1974. In 1975, he started a PhD in Physics at the University of Nottingham in one of the three original groups that began MRI. In Raymond Andrew‚Äôs group, alongside that of Peter Mansfield, they built the first MRI system producing radiographic-quality images of the human wrist (Nature), and performed the initial work on RF-field and power deposition in human MRI. Upon completing his PhD, he went to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1978 to adapt MRI for spatially localized MRS, using surface coils to demonstrate metabolite depletion and reversal in regional myocardial ischemia (Science). In 1980, Paul joined the GE Research Center in Schenectady NY. Together with William A. Edelstein and others, this group formed the nucleus of GE's early MRI development program. They ordered the biggest magnet available ‚Äì a 1.5 Tesla system ‚Äì and built the first high-field whole-body MRI/MRS scanner, overcoming problems of coil design, RF penetration and signal-to-noise. The results translated into the highly successful 1.5 Tesla clinical MRI products of which there are well over 20,000 systems today, representing 60-70% of all systems. Paul did the first localized MRS in human heart and brain. After starting a collaboration on heart applications with Robert Weiss at Johns Hopkins, Paul returned to Johns Hopkins University in 1994, as Professor and Director of the MR Research Division. He works on the application of MRS to measure cardiac energy metabolism in the healthy and failing heart, and the development of interventional MRI technology. He has about 200 peer-reviewed papers with most-cited reviews of tissue relaxation in Medical Physics, and ~50 patents, including high-field MRI (>0.7 Tesla), spin- echo MRI, ‚Äòcrusher‚Äô gradients, 'fat-saturation', '3D-slab' MRI, and 'point resolved spectroscopy' (PRESS), 2D spatially-selective pulses, MRI-safe implantable leads (licensed and sold as Avista‚Ñ¢ by Boston Scientific Inc), and 'MRI endoscopy'. He is an ISMRM Fellow, 1989 Gold Medal recipient, a GE gold patent and Coolidge Fellowship awardee, and 2015 Gold Medal recipient of the American Roentgen-Ray Society.http://www.mri.jhu.edu/DivMRRes/bottomley2.htm ==Awards== *Gold Medal of the Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (1989) *GE Coolidge Fellow and Medal, (1990) *GE Gold (1989), Silver (1985) and Bronze (1982) patent medallions *Editors recognition awards from Radiology (1986, 1988, 1989, 1990) *GE Dushman Award (1983) *Associate Editor, Magn Reson Med (1983-2004), Deputy Editor (2010-present) *Editorial Boards of Magn Reson Imag (1982‚Äìpresent), Rev Sci Instrum (1986-1988),and Radiology (1991-5) *Editorial Board of Advanced Medicine (Japan: 1995‚Äì); MAGMA (2003‚Äì2006) *Elected Trustee, Soc Magn Reson Med (1986-1989), and Soc Magn Reson Imag (1982-1986) *Fellow, Soc Magn Reson (1989) *Gold Medal of the American Roentgen Ray Society (2015) *Distinguished Investigator, Academy of Radiology Research (2012) *Member, National Academy of Inventors (2015) *Soc Magn Reson Med Sir Peter Mansfield Lecturer (2012) *NIH grant reviewer since 1979 https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:B53Isq9e5y4J:icmic.rad.jhmi.edu/icmicpersonnel/BIOBottomleyP.pdf+&hl;=en‚â∑=au&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEESiJwN- VFDBZYAJNlCrH_6bwkyc1QP4zv- Ukp7f1oJKlFJzF9iLLzDdlb4VNBXPRwkrTrogeyzxobrciLvGJXovo-5LVBzC7JSURgDmLCIbufYXxKxlSDTC5hoBNPtSUuSUlDTkQ&sig;=AHIEtbRg7nI1dQNK7HaMLiWtT- ykWar9rA ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Magnetic resonance imaging Category:21st-century American chemists Category:Australian chemists ","title":"Paul Bottomley (scientist)"},{"id":"35837109","text":"Dallas Green may refer to: * Dallas Green (musician) (born 1980), Canadian musician * Dallas Green (baseball) (1934‚Äì2017), American baseball player and manager * Dallas Green Monarchs, a former semipro baseball team Green, Dallas ","title":"Dallas Green"},{"id":"35837131","text":"Barranbinja or Barrabinya is an extinct Australian Aboriginal language of New South Wales. The last speaker was probably Mrs Emily Margaret Horneville (d. 1979), who was recorded by Lynette Oates who then published a short description of it. It had also been recorded by R.H. Mathews along with Muruwari, though not all items in his wordlist were recognised by Mrs Horneville. Both Mathews and Oates conclude that Barranbinya and Muruwari were in a dialect relation. == Relationship with other languages == Lynette Oates' work on Muruwari and Barranbinya gives a cognate count of 44% between the two varieties, concluding that both were likely in a dialect relation. R.H. Mathews (1903), who recorded both Muruwari and Barranbinya, also commented that besides vocabulary differences, the grammar of both Muruwari and Barranbinya were essentially the same. Together, Muruwari and Barranbinya form an isolate group within the Pama-Nyungan language family, and were very different in many respects from their geographic neighbours (which belong to many different Pama-Nyungan subgroups). For more information, see the description for Muruwari. ==PhonologyPhonemic inventory=== The phonemic inventory is very similar to Muruwari, although the relative paucity of data means that the status of many phonemes is not clear (in round brackets). {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - + Consonant phonemes ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  ! colspan=\\"2\\" Peripheral ! colspan=\\"2\\" Apical ! colspan=\\"2\\" Laminal - !

In 2000, he sought election to the New Hampshire State Senate, losing the Democratic primary to Dan O'Neil. After losing the primary, he sought re-election to the House as a Libertarian Party member and won with 18% of the vote. Vaillancourt was successfully reelected to the House as a Republican in 2002 (21%), 2004 (25%), 2006 (19%), 2008 (19%), 2010 (25%), and 2012 (25%). Following Vaillancourt's opposition to a resolution introduced in the 2014 legislative session sponsored by the grassroots political action committee Wolf PAC, which would call for an Article V Convention to propose a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics and overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Wolf PAC mobilized to campaign against Vaillancourt in his reelection efforts to the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Vaillancourt was ultimately defeated in his reelection bid, losing to Republican Mark McLean by 89 votes. Vaillancourt ran a successful campaign to return to the State House in 2016, winning one of the two District 15 seats with 26% of the vote and defeating Mark McLean by 110 votes. He served in the body until his death in March 2017. ===Tenure=== While he only ran as a libertarian once, his political views were very much in line with their philosophy. He strongly opposed Obamacare and tried to block the expansion of medicaid in his state. He strongly opposed the death penalty in New Hampshire and supported abolishing it. When defending the bill that would abolish it, he said \\"We make mistakes. Police prosecutors make mistakes. In the name of Carlos DeLuna, please pass this bill.\\" He also supported marijuana legalization. In January 2014, he was the chief sponsor of House Bill 492, which would legalize marijuana for recreational purposes in New Hampshire. It followed the Colorado model, allowing possession of one ounce and six plants by adults over 21. He estimated it could bring the state $25 million to $30 million a year in revenue. It passed the House by a 170-162 vote, the first time a legislative body in the United States approved a full marijuana legalization bill. In addition, it passed despite a veto threat by Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan. A majority of Democrats voted in favor, 106-83, while a slight majority of Republicans voted against it, 64-79. However, Vaillancourt admitted that it was unlikely to pass the New Hampshire Senate saying \\"there is virtually no chance this bill will even get to the governor's desk.\\" While some people hoped that Hassan would change her mind like how Governor John Lynch evolved on same-sex marriage in New Hampshire, Vaillancourt had doubts saying \\"Governor Lynch was worn down by some of his personal friends. I'm not going to lie to you, I don't think we're going to wear this governor down on this issue.\\" Vaillancourt supported same-sex marriage in the state, and voted in favor of HB 73, the 2009 bill which legalized same-sex marriage. He joined a minority of the Republican supermajority in opposition to the 2011 attempted repeal of same-sex marriage. Child pornography controversy Vaillancourt and former Democratic House member Raymond Buckley had been friends since 1983, and housemates until 1999, when Vaillancourt evicted Buckley for unknown reasons. The relationship had been strained since then. In January 2007, Vaillancourt leveled accusations that Buckley possessed child pornography, causing Buckley to temporarily suspend his campaign for the chairmanship of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Vaillancourt later admitted he had no proof to back up his allegations. Buckley went on to become chair of the Democratic Party in March. Nazi salute controversy On May 15, 2012, Vaillancourt was temporarily suspended from the House floor after stating \\"Sieg Heil\\" in the direction of the Speaker, Bill O'Brien. The action came after Vaillancourt objected to limitations on debate over a voter ID bill, only to be ruled out of order by the Speaker. An apology committee of three (Rep. Shawn Jasper, R-Hudson, Rep. David Hess, R-Hooksett, and Rep. David B. Campbell, D-Nashua) was formed in order to compel Vaillancourt to form an acceptable apology to the House; Vaillancourt offered two unaccepted apologies, one offering never to mention any German words on the floor, until his third apology was finally accepted by the House. Vaillancourt was the first member of the New Hampshire House to be ejected from the chamber in over two decades. Sexist comments In a 2014 blog post, Vaillancourt described New Hampshire Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster as \\"ugly as sin\\", comparing her unfavorably to a drag queen. In his blog, he went on to praise the looks of Republican challenger Marilinda Garcia, who described his views as \\"sexist\\" the next day. ===Committee assignments=== ;2013 *Criminal Justice and Public Safety ;2011 *Finance *Finance-Division I *Special Committee On Redistricting ==Personal life== Vaillancourt lived in Manchester, New Hampshire. In 1992 and 1993, he lived in post-communist Berlin to study German reunification. He frequently visited Canada to observe politics of Montreal. He was openly gay.\\"Hundreds pack statehouse to fight repeal of same-sex marriage law\\". The Telegraph, February 18, 2011.\\"Gay-marriage bill stalls in New Hampshire\\". Reuters, May 20, 2009. Vaillancourt had an impeccable committee attendance record, so it was noticed that he did not appear at the legislature on March 22, 2017. He could not be reached by phone. Someone immediately investigated his Manchester home and discovered that he had died. The exact date and cause of death are unknown. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Manchester, New Hampshire Category:People from Middlebury, Vermont Category:Plymouth State University alumni Category:Libertarian Party (United States) officeholders Category:New Hampshire Republicans Category:New Hampshire city council members Category:Members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Category:New Hampshire Libertarians Category:LGBT state legislators in New Hampshire Category:Gay politicians Category:New Hampshire Democrats Category:Members of the Libertarian Party (United States) Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Steve Vaillancourt"},{"id":"35837356","text":"Antichloris viridis, the satin stowaway or banana moth, is a moth of the family Erebidae.

Saldanha Bay, with its sheltered moorings, was the ideal location. The South African Seaward Defence Force and a minesweeping flotilla were established in 1942 for seaward and harbour protection. On Baviaanskop, Elands Bay, Malgaskop and Hoedjiespunt, 6-inch and 12-inch guns were installed. Anti-submarine nets were laid in North Bay, and eight lines of moored mines and a control centre on land protected the entrance of Saldanha Bay. Members of the South African Women's Auxiliary Naval Services, previously known as SWANS, manned the controls and detection equipment. All the British living quarters became the property of the SA Navy on 14 June 1944. In 1948 the training establishment HMSAS Field Marshal Smuts moved from Saldanha to Salisbury island in Durban. However, the base at Saldanha soon reverted to a training base in 1951 when the Naval Gymnasium was set up with 44 trainees reporting for a year's training.http://www.navy.mil.za/peoplesnavy/saldanha/history.htm Before the unit was christened SAS Saldanha on 1 March 1956, it was known as the \\"Naval and Marine Gymnasium\\" and \\"SAS Drommedaris.\\" With the implementation of 12 months compulsory National Service, SAS Saldanha started training recruits from both the National Service and the Permanent Force. In May 1989 SAS Saldanha became a naval base with the added responsibility to still function as a unit. This was maintained until 1990 when, due to rationalisation, it reverted to a pure training unit. ==Training Courses== The training that currently takes place at SAS Saldanha is divided into three parts:http://www.navy.mil.za/peoplesnavy/saldanha/index.htm * Military Skills Development (MSD) Training * Military Training for Ratings Part 2 (MTR 2)- a requirement for Leading Seamen to become a Petty Officer * Military Training for Ratings Part 3 (MTR 3) - needed for promotion to Warrant Officer SA Navy also trains NARYSEC (YLDP - Youth Leadership Development Programme) participants, who are recruited by Department of Rural Development & Land Reform. In a year period of time, SAS Saldanha welcomes 2 or 3 intake, which consists of nearly one thousand (1 000) youth from across South Africa. These youth people receive leadership training through the military approach of training.

Two classifications are commonly used:Les d√©finitions des termes et indicateurs statistiques de l'√©ducation nationale - Niveau de formation The nomenclature des niveaux de formation (national classification of levels of training),Insee - D√©finitions et m√©thodes - Niveaux de formation established in 1969 by the Commission statistique nationale (national statistical commission), and the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), validated by UNESCO in 1997 and used for international comparisons. The first one is used by the Ministry of National Education, but also by the French employment agency, to classify jobseekers by education level, and by INSEE for the census,France m√©tropolitaine - Th√™me ¬´ Dipl√¥mes - Formation ¬ª ... The issue of classification reform arises from European degrees harmonization, including the phasing of final diplomas of undergraduate higher education (level III). However, even after the phasing, there are still many graduates. Thus, although the Certificat d'√©tudes primaires was officially abolished in 1989, which does not prevent to find today, in the French population, individuals who had stopped at this level of training. == National classification of levels of training (1967) == It defines the levels of training in terms of duration.Nomenclature des niveaux de formation === Level VI === Staff with a job which not requires training beyond compulsory schooling. === Level V Bis === Staff with a job assuming a specialized training for a maximum of one year beyond the first cycle of secondary education, level of the certificat de formation professionnelle (vocational training certificate). === Level V === Staff with a job normally requiring a level of training equivalent to the Brevet d'√©tudes professionnelles (BEP) (two years of education beyond the first cycle of secondary education) and to the Certificat d'aptitude professionnelle (CPC ). Provisionally, the training of the National diploma acquired. === Level IV ===  IV a  Staff with a job normally requiring a Baccalaur√©at, a brevet de technician (BT), a brevet sup√©rieur d'enseignement commercial (BSEC) (three years of education beyond the first cycle of secondary education) .

This level corresponds to a full qualification for the practice of a specific activity, with the ability to use instruments and techniques relating thereto. This activity involves chiefly the performance of a work which may be independently conduct within the limits of the techniques related thereto. === Level IV === Staff with a jobs of control or highly skilled worker and can attest a level of training equivalent to that of the brevet professionel (BP), the brevet de technicien (BT), a Baccalaur√©at professionel or a Baccalaur√©at technologique. A degree of level IV requires more theoretical knowledge than the previous level. This activity involves chiefly technical work which can be performed independently and/or entail executive coaching (control). === Level III === Staff with a jobs that normally requires a Dipl√¥me universitaire de technologie (DUT) or a Brevet de technicien sup√©rieur (BTS) or end of undergraduate higher education. A degree of Level III corresponds to the knowledge and skills level, though lacking the knowledge of the scientific basis of the areas concerned. Capabilities and knowledge required ensure to be able to work autonomously or independently responsibilities of design and/or coaching and/or management. === Level II === Staff with a middle management job that normally requires a training of a Bachelor's degree level or a first- year Master's degree level. At this level, the practice of an employment contract or independent means knowing the scientific foundations of the job, generally leading to autonomy in carrying out this activity. === Level I === Staff with a middle management job that normally requires a training above the first-year Master's degree level.

After working briefly in the German Department at Durham University in 1945, Lockwood taught at the University of Birmingham, during which time he also briefly taught as a Senior Lecturer in German at the University of Sydney. As he left Birmingham, the University awarded him a D.Litt. on the basis of his many publications. In 1961 he received an invitation to the Chair of Comparative Philology at the Humboldt-Universit√§t in East Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic. 1961, however, was the year in which the Communist regime erected its infamous wall, and after four years of increasing disillusionment with the political climate he returned to the West. He settled in Dublin, intending to devote himself to his philological studies, including German and Germanic languages (especially Faroese) as well as Roman, Hellenic, Slavonic and Celtic (especially Welsh) languages. A year later, however, he was invited to take up a specially established readership in Germanic and Indo-European philology at Reading. This readership was converted into a chair in 1968, and he remained at Reading until his retirement.W. B. Lockwood: On the Occasion of his Retirement, W. A.

He had three brothers, along with nine sisters, but in 1713 primogeniture was introduced in the principalities of Schwarzburg, and therefore he became the sole ruling Prince of Rudolstadt in 1718. His education was organized primarily by his grandparents. Frederick Anton was encouraged to study religion and various sciences. He was particularly interested in poetry and wrote some poems himself. Between 1716 and 1731, the country was in the grips of the Balisius Unrest, named after the lawyer Johann Georg Balisius. The government tried to increase the tax burden, leading to unrest in 1716. The people tried every legal means available to fight the increase and demanded a reduction instead. In the end, the government prevailed, however, the risk of insurgency remained. The Prince hardly dealt with the business of government. Instead his Chancellor, Georg Ulrich of Beulwitz was solely responsibly for government policy. This was well known to his subjects, who considered him unfit to rule. In 1727, he granted two Jewish families permission to settle in Immenrode (today part of Sondershausen).History of the Jewish community in Immenrode, viewed on 10 October 2011 Between 1727 and 1737, nine more Jewish families were granted the same privilege. These families developed into the largest Jewish community in the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1732, some 2000 refugees from Salzburg arrived in Rudolstadt. They were Protestants and had been expelled from Salzburg when Salzburg began enforcing Catholicism in 1731. They were welcomed with ringing of church bells and a church service in the St. Andreas church in Rudolstadt. Most of them settled in Uhlstedt. Frederick Anton accepted these refugees in response to a written request from King Frederick William I of Prussia who had invited the Protestants from Salzburg to Prussia with \\"emirgration patent\\" of 1731 and his \\"invitation patent\\" of 1732. When many Protestants arrived in Prussia, Frederick William wrote to the princes of neighbouring principalities, asking them to house and feed some of the refugees. One gets a better idea of the scale of this influx if one realises that the refugees arrived in groups of 1000 at a time when Rudolstadt had only around 540 inhabitants.Chronik der f√ºrstl. Schwarzburgischen Residenzstadt Rudolstadt von L. Renovanz, Rudolstadt 1860, S. 131‚Äì133, viewed on 10 October 2011 Frederick Anton had to cope with a number of financial setbacks, which he found hard to do. His brother William Louis was always in debt, and Frederick Anton had to bail him out more than once. In 1726, fire broke out in the ancestral Schwarzburg Castle. In 1735, Heidecksburg Castle burned down to the ground. In 1737, Frederick Anton began construction of a new Great Hall on the site of Heidecksburg Castle. In 1741, a bust of the prince was installed over the main gate of the courtyard. Construction was completed in November 1744.Chronik der f√ºrstl.

CATE's researchers work closely with regulatory bodies, which include the International Civil Aviation Organization, the European Commission, the UK Government and the US FAA;aviation sectors such as the airports, airlines and air traffic management organisations; aerospace and aircraft engine manufacturers; academics, research laboratories and NGOs. CATE's research underpins policy formulation and supports technological development in helping the stakeholders minimise the environmental impacts of aviation to achieve long-term sustainable growth. ==Main areas of expertiseSustainability and the air transport industry=== This area of work involves the application of sustainability theory to the air transport industry, the role of aviation in supporting social and economic development, the associated environmental impacts, the need to compensate for growth through the development of new infrastructure, technologies, operations and business models. ===Global climate change=== The research investigates the impact of airplane emissions upon the climate. Led by Professor David Lee, this research group uses a range of modelling tools to calculate global aviation emissions and scenarios, contrail coverage and simplified climate response models of aviation-specific effects. With the evidence stemming from this research, the group provides advice and support on aviation related climate change issues for UK Government Departments and to fora such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The importance of CATE's work in this field is reflected by the contribution of four CATE researchers to the IPCC's seminal 1999 report Aviation and the Global Atmosphere. The IPCC was jointly awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, and the contribution to the IPCC of many scientists was acknowledged. ===Noise and community impacts=== Led by Professor Callum Thomas and Dr Paul Hooper, this research group addresses the environmental and community impacts of airports and airline operations within the vicinity of airports. The research programme focuses on issues of regulatory limits, measurement, management and impact of noise on local residents as well as the processes of stakeholder engagement and understanding community attitudes to airport growth. The UK Governments's night flying policy was underpinned by research carried out by CATE staff (Dr. Ken Hume). Manchester Airport's noise control programme and community relations programmes were developed with CATE researchers. More recently, CATE has been commissioned by the NI Government to produce a 'good practice guide' on the measurement and management or aircraft noise for Northern Ireland Airports. ===Local air quality=== This group focuses on the way airports and airlines deal with air quality issues. CATE provides expertise in air quality modelling and monitoring and provide advice on how emissions can be managed and reduced. The research group, led by Professor David Raper investigates the fundamental processes that control dispersion of pollutants around airports. This group researches the impact of wing tip induced vortices on dispersion of aircraft engine exhaust fumes and led one of three Air Quality Panels for Department for Transport while contributing to another, to review the impact of aircraft emissions on air quality around Heathrow Airport. ==List of organizations CATE has worked withGlobal=== *The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) *The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) *The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) *Airport Council International World Body (ACI) *The International Air Transport Association (IATA) *The International Commission on the Biologocial Effects of Noise (ICBEN) *The World Economic Forum (WEF) *The US FAA ===European=== *The European Commission (EC) *Noise Pollution Health Effects Reduction (NOPHER) *Airports Council International Europe (ACI-EUROPE) ===National=== *Future of Aviation Policy Advisory Group (DfT) *Aerospace Innovation Growth Team (DTI) *Greener By Design (DfT/DTI) *Commercial Aviation Sustainability Strategy (DTI) ==Research partnersResearch laboratories=== *DLR ‚Äì The German Aerospace Centre *FOI ‚Äì Swedish Defence Research Agency *NLR ‚Äì National Aerospace Laboratory - The Netherlands *ONERA ‚Äì The French Aeronautics and Space Research Centre ===Academia=== *Loughborough University *University of Cambridge *University of Leeds *University of Manchester *University of Nottingham *University of Oxford *University of Reading *University of Sheffield *University of Central Florida (USA) *University of Essen (De) *University of Illinois (USA) *University of l'Aquila (It) *University of Oslo (No) *University of Paris XII (Fr) *University of Stockholm (Sw) *University of Strasbourg (Fr) *University of Trento (It) *University of Utrecht (NL) *University of Wageningen (NL) ===Airports=== *BAA Airports *Belfast *Birmingham *Bucharest *Dublin *Heathrow Airport Limited *Liverpool ‚Äì John Lennon *Manchester Airport Group *Oslo Airport *The UK Airport Operators Association (AoA) ===Airlines=== *BA *Cathay Pacific *Delta *Lufthansa ===Air Traffic Management=== *CANSO *EUROCONTROL *UK National Air Traffic Services (NATS) ===Manufacturers=== *Airbus *BAE Systems *Boeing *Rolls Royce ===UK Government=== *UK Government ‚Äì Office of the Prime Minister *UK Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) *UK Government Department for Transport **UK Civil Aviation Administration (UK CAA) **The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) *US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ==References External links == * Category:Aviation and the environment Category:Aviation research institutes ","title":"Centre for Aviation, Transport and Environment"},{"id":"35837728","text":"Historically, Greeks in Azerbaijan have not formed a large community in comparison to those in neighbouring Georgia and Armenia. It was composed mainly of Pontic Greek immigrants from the Ottoman Empire. == History  Under the Russian Empire === Initially, these immigrants arrived in the 1830s and settled in the village of Mehmana on the banks of the Tartar river. On 23 May 1830, the Georgian exarch appointed archpriest Vasily Andrianov to lead the religious community of Mehmana.Ivan Pilijov. Greeks in Azerbaijan . In 1851, Trebizond-born Charalambos Koundourov (locally known as Usta Allahverdi) built two copper smelteries near Ordubad where the core staff consisted of Greek labourers. Ten years later, a school and a church for the Greek community were built there as well. The church was headed by Nikolaos Lavos. Koundourov's sons owned the smelteries after his death until the October Revolution. Local Greeks were also prominent in architecture and construction. The Saint Nicholas Church in Baku and an Orthodox church in Altiaghaj were designed and built in the 1850s by Greek architects and contractors. Greeks had not started immigrating to Baku, the present-day capital of Azerbaijan, until the oil boom of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Statistical records from 1886 revealed no Greek population in the Baku Governorate, but the picture changed in 1897 when the census indicated 278 Greeks in the Baku Governorate and 658 in the Elisabethpol Governorate (compared to 102 in 1886). The immigrants consisted mainly of general labourers and retailers and included both Turkish citizens and natives of the Greek settlements elsewhere in the Caucasus. In 1907, the city of Baku alone had an estimated Greek population of 800, most of whom had immigrated from Asia Minor and therefore could not execute religious services in Russian Orthodox churches where the working languages were Old Church Slavonic and Russian. Thus the Greek Benevolent Society of Baku received a permission to construct a Greek Orthodox church in Baku. The number of Greeks in Baku did not change much according to the 1917 official statistical data.Sudaba Zeynalova. Ethnodemographic Changes in the Caucasus: Development of Ethnic European Communities in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century. Central Asia & Central Caucasus Press AB, 2009, #4. According to Russian ethnographist Andrei Popov, there were 2,161 Greeks living in eight cities and villages across the Governorates of Baku and Elisabethpol as of 1919.Andrei Popov. Pontic Greeks . === Soviet period === Another wave of Greek immigration took place in the aftermath of World War I and the establishment of Soviet rule in Baku in 1920. By 1923, Azerbaijan's Greek population rose to over 1,000, of which 58 people lived in the pioneer settlement of Mehmana. The building of the Greek philanthropic association located on Millionnaya Street (presently Amirov Street) in Baku housed an amateur Greek theatre, a church, a library and a primary school which had 89 students in 1921. There was a community football club named Embros. Curiously nearly a third of Azerbaijan's Greek population chose to retain foreign citizenship. By 1937, 95% of foreign citizens residing in Azerbaijan were Greeks. This factor, as well as the Soviet Union's changing attitude toward its Greek population led to Greeks of Baku being a target of repression and forced relocation. In 1937‚Äì1938, many members of the community were arrested and some later executed. Among the victims was actress Pamphylia Tanailidi. By 1939, with the help of the Greek embassy in the USSR, most foreign citizens of Greek origin left Baku for Greece. Two more waves of repression resulting in relocation to Central Asia and Siberia targeted Greeks of Azerbaijan with Soviet citizenship and took place in 1942 and 1949 respectively, as part of the Bolshevik campaign of \\"clearing the Caucasus from the politically untrustworthy elements.\\" ===Since independence=== Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, in the midst of political instability over 100 of the remaining Greeks left Azerbaijan. The Greek population of the village of Mehmana fled during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1994, a Greek cultural centre was established in Baku at the initiative of the Greek ambassador. In 1997, it was reorganized into the Argo Greek Society. The community, which has largely lost the Pontic language, presently numbers 535 people, both Greeks and descendants of mixed families. ==See also== *Azerbaijan‚ÄìGreece relations ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Azerbaijan Azerbaijan ","title":"Greeks in Azerbaijan"},{"id":"35837735","text":"Ernesto Vela (born 20 October 1968) is a Mexican former swimmer who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the 1988 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican male swimmers Category:Male backstroke swimmers Category:Pan American Games competitors for Mexico Category:Olympic swimmers of Mexico Category:Swimmers at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 1987 Pan American Games Category:Swimmers at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Mexico Category:Competitors at the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in swimming ","title":"Ernesto Vela"},{"id":"35837749","text":"Knipe‚ÄìJohnson Farm is a historic home and farm located in Upper Gwynedd Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

In 1923, supported by a local businessman, he developed a self-winding wristwatch and applied for a patent in Switzerland, which was granted in September, 1924. His design ensured that the watch could be hermetically sealed against the ingress of water or dust. The hands could be reset by a rotating bezel. After four years, supported by funds from two Manchester brothers, Louis and Philip Alexander, he persuaded Swiss watch manufacturers Anton Schild S.A. and Walter Vogt of Fortis to manufacture the design. Blancpain also made them under licence in 1928 for sale in France and the Perpetual Self-Winding Watch Company manufactured them for sale in North America.

G√ºtzlaff announced that he would start a monthly magazine that would correct this impression by introducing the ideas of Western art and science and promote understanding and friendship. In March 1834 the magazine carried an article entitled \\"A Discussion of Newspaper Strategy\\" „ÄäÊñ∞ÈóªÁ∫∏Áï•ËÆ∫„Äã (Xƒ´nw√©nzh«ê Lu√® L√πn), which was the first treatise on the Western press to appear in China. Although only 331 words long, the article covered newspaper origination, freedom of the press and reviewed the details of a number of Western papers. Copies of the magazine were circulated to Nanking (Nanjing), Peking (Beijing) and other cities but its reception is not recorded.Britton 1933, p. 24 The magazine ceased publication after Issue 10 in May 1834, restarted in February 1835 only to cease again in July of the same year. The magazine relocated to Singapore in 1837, printing its last issue in 1838. ==Publication style and features== The Eastern Western Monthly Magazine employed Chinese style printing techniques using wooden blocks with a structure similar to Chinese Monthly Magazine „Ää:zh:ÂØü‰∏ñ‰øóÊØèÊúàÁªüËÆ°‰º†„Äã produced by Robert Morrison, Walter Henry Medhurst and William Milne. Although edited by a missionary, the magazine played down this aspect, focusing instead on promoting the superiority of Western culture and criticising the Chinese people's arrogant xenophobic attitude in three sections covering religion, morals and ethics and scientific thought. G√ºtzlaff wrote in the prospectus: > \\"The monthly periodical, which is now offered for the patronage of the > foreign community of Canton and Macao, is published with a view to > counteract these high and exclusive notions [the Chinese profess to be first > among the nations on earth, and regard all others as 'Barbarians'.], by > making the Chinese acquainted with our arts, sciences, and principles. It > will not treat of politics, nor tend to exasperate their minds by harsh > language upon any subject. There is a more excellent way to show that we are > not indeed 'Barbarians', and the Editor prefers the method of exhibiting > facts, to convince the Chinese that they still have very much to learn. > Aware also, of the relation in which foreigners stand to the native > authorities, the Editor has endeavoured to conciliate their friendship, and > hopes ultimately to prove successful.Britton 1933, p. 23 G√ºtzlaff's pseudonym, \\"One who loves the Chinese\\" (), appeared on the front cover of early issues of the magazine.Zang 2007, p. 40 ==Surviving copies== Despite its importance for research into historical Sino-western exchanges, few copies of the Eastern Western Magazine still exist in China although 39 issues are held in the Harvard University Yenching Institute () Library. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==Further reading== * Category:Publications established in 1833 Category:Mass media in Guangzhou Category:Magazines published in China ","title":"Eastern Western Monthly Magazine"},{"id":"35837779","text":"Thomas Oliver was a Tyneside poet/songwriter from the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. ==Details == P.

Archaeological research indicates that there was a church here in 650, although 1170 is the earliest date in recorded history.\\"Portsmouth in the past\\" Gates,W.G p77: East Ardsley, SRP, 1972 ==History== Throughout its history the church has played an important role in the life of the island, especially for the local communities of Fratton, Landport and Buckland. The current church was built in the 1880s to a design by Arthur Blomfield.\\"The Buildings of England: Hampshire\\" Pevsner,N; Lloyd, D.. p. 441: Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1973 The reredos above the altar is by C E Buckeridge. The church is a major landmark in the city and its tower can be clearly seen rising above the surrounding terraces. The church was built with the support of W. H. Smith, then the First Lord of the Admiralty, to serve the needs of the city and to be an inspiration to all who saw it. The building is a notable example of its era and contains many fine pieces, especially the Walker organ designed for the church. The organ has been described by a contemporary expert as being of \\"national importance\\". In addition to building the parish church, a number of other buildings, institutes and mission halls were built to serve all who lived and worked in this area of the city, especially those struggling in what was a deprived area. The history of this period is nationally known and St Mary's holds a place in folk lore, particularly as two vicars at the start of the 20th century went on to become Archbishop of Canterbury (Cosmo Lang) and Archbishop of York (Cyril Garbett). The building is Grade II* listed and sits in an extensive churchyard. ==Present== While many things have developed in the city around it, St Mary's continues to be a landmark and a place held in the affections of many who live and work in the city. It has witnessed hundreds of marriages over the years, as well as having touched many people's lives through its various mission churches, institutions, clubs, groups and choir. Many regard it as \\"their\\" church even though they have long moved out of the geographical parish. The parish itself continues to have \\"areas of deprivation\\" covering a large part of Charles Dickens Ward and including the Landport SRB area of need. In recent times the church has also developed as a place for concerts and is used regularly by the Portsmouth Choral Union, the Portsmouth Festival Choir and the Royal Marine School of Music. The building offers good acoustics, onsite parking for a large number of cars and seating for 600 people in one large open space. The churchyard is leased to the city council and is used as a large park area by many people in the midst of a densely populated area. In addition, on the May Bank Holiday, the churchyard is the site of the May Fayre, a large event for the whole community run by the church. Regular features of the May Fayre include an arena for performers such as Morris dancers, a beer tent, and stalls from a variety of businesses selling hand-crafted goods and lots of homemade food. The present church council and congregation are keen to honour the vision and ethos of the builders of the church 120 years ago and ensure it both remains a landmark, serves the needs of the local community and city and seeks to inspire all who visit it. The parish has successfully completed a major renovation and restoration of the main body of the church and in particular the roofs - raising some ¬£1million in grants and funds. It now wishes to move from the work of simple restoration and look at how it can further develop the building and its site so that it continues into the 21st century to fulfil the vision of its builders and to honour the Christian presence in this place for 1,000 years. ===Organ=== The organ of St Mary's Portsea is an integral part of Canon Edgar Jacob's grand vision for \\"a mother church of Portsea Island ... (standing as) a beacon to the city of Portsmouth.\\"\\"The Portsmouth Papers: Portsea Island Churches\\" Lubbock, R., p. 12: Portsmouth, Portsmouth City Council, 1969. In 1888 plans for an organ to match the scope and scale of the new building were drawn up. The firm of J. W. Walker were selected to provide a new instrument for the building with George Martin, organist of St Paul's Cathedral, acting as consultant. Plans were made for a grand four manual instrument, but funds were scarce. The result was a three manual instrument of thirty-eight speaking stops, albeit with a four manual console (the redundant manual was for many years used as a bookshelf), which was completed in October 1892. The church architect, R. A. Blomfield, had designed an organ case, but this was not installed for another nine years.Details of the organ on the National Pipe Organ Register ===The Organ Project=== In August 2018, the Organ Project submitted an application for funding to the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and received ¬£32,100 to help restore the Organ to its former state. This involves reverting the pitch back to 449.9Hz, reconstructing the console to match the original J.W. Walker style, cleaning and correcting the pipes, and cleaning and waxing the casework. The Organ Project also has a 6-point plan on how to explore and interpret the organ's heritage: looking at the science of heritage, the art of heritage and the history of heritage (including the Boer War, connecting heritage history, restoring and securing heritage, and sharing and celebrating heritage. In April 2020, The Organ Project Committee was pleased to announce the success of a second round of applications, securing ¬£764,000 of Lottery Funding.

It is found in shallow waters in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. ==Description== Underside of Asterias forbesi Asterias forbesi usually has 5 arms but occasionally has 4 or 6. Like many starfish species, the upper surface is covered in blunt conical projections giving it a rough feel. Some of these are pedicellariae, minute pincers that can grip objects. The arms are plump, broad at the base and tapering to a blunt tip. This starfish grows to about in diameter with an arm length of about . The madreporite is usually pink and is visible near the edge of the disc. There are several rows of tube feet on the underside on either side of the ambulacral groove that run down the centre of each arm. The colour of the upper side is variable, ranging from brown or tan to reddish-purple and the underside is usually pale brown. Near the tip on the underside of each arm there are small eyespots. These are not set on short stalks as they are in the otherwise similar Asterias rubens with which this species can be confused. ==Distribution== Asterias forbesi is found in the intertidal zone of rocky shores on the Atlantic coast of North America from Maine southwards to the Gulf of Mexico. Asterias rubens has a more northerly range, being found from Labrador southward to Cape Hatteras, most commonly north of Cape Cod living in colder, deeper waters. ==Behaviour== Asterias forbesi feeds on bivalve molluscs and other marine invertebrates. It can open shells by gripping the two halves with its tube feet and forcing them apart. It then inserts its stomach, turning it inside out in the process, and secretes enzymes, digesting the body of the mollusc in situ. Starfish can locate their prey by chemoreception. In a trial, sixty Asterias forbesi that had not been fed for a week were used. The bait was a piece of mussel flesh in a tank of slowly circulating water. Test starfish were placed in the downstream odour plume, one metre (3 ft 3 in) away from the food source and the movements of each starfish were recorded on videotape. A control was provided using the same flow conditions but without an odour being present. 12 of the test starfish (20%) moved towards the target and got within of it in the allotted 15 minute timespan. The direction of movement became more accurate as the distance from the bait shortened. The rate of movement was slower than that of the control starfish and it was thought that this slower speed might improve the ability of the starfish to taste the water and make accurate comparisons of odour concentrations. None of the control starfish moved purposely in any direction, tending to move in random directions, circling and crossing their previous paths. It was proposed that more starfish would have moved towards the bait if they had previously been starved for a longer period. Other similar trials have involved starving starfish for two months prior to the experiment and this provides greater motivation to seek prey. The sexes are separate in Asterias forbesi. Sperm and eggs are liberated into the sea and fertilization is external. The starfish in any area may synchronise their emission of gametes which will increase the chance of fertilization taking place. The eggs hatch into bipinnaria larvae which form part of the zooplankton and develop over a period of about three weeks before settling on the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile starfish. ==Ecology== The ciliate parasite Orchitophrya stellarum has been found in the gonads of up to 20% of male Asterias forbesi in Long Island Sound. They feed on the tissue of the gonad and effectively castrate their host. A small number of females were also found to contain the parasite. ==References== Category:Asterias Category:Animals described in 1848 ","title":"Asterias forbesi"},{"id":"35838120","text":"Beerbee Mungnari (born Waterloo Station, 1931) is an Australian aboriginal artist.

Members of the tribe prefer the name Malaa. == Language == Malaa people use a language unintelligible to most of the other Adi tribes. There has been several theories regarding this language; most Malaa maintain that they adopted their language from a people called Soi-sotem, who inhabited their lands long before Malaa settled there. The Malaa remember the Soi-sotem in their ballads as: : Soi belu kettunge, Sotem belu kettunge. Soi sotem were believed to come from Kalang Ade(dite), the highest peak in the land of the Milang beyond which is the land of Idu Mishmi people. ==Religion== The Malaa are adherents of indigenous Donyi-Poloism, the practice of praying to the almighty Sun goddess and The Moon God. The priests, called Madar in Malaa, are popularly believed to be the intermediaries between the natural human world and Spiritual and supernatural world. Male priests are connected with act of divination while the female priests are related with healing of sickness. The priesthood is hereditary practice as it passed from generation to generation in a family. The ritual of sacrificing an animal as suggested by priest to cure a disease is called Lulu. Whenever an epidemic or disease breaks down in a village,the villagers construct a gate at the entrance of the village and a dog is sacrificed with intestines sagging out and hanged.This ritual is called Lukan. Ayid Madar Bemmanu, a ritualistic dance is performed throughout the night in which priest bargains to appease the spirits to release the soul of diseased person and in exchange for gifts. The priest examines the chicken liver and reads omen and suggest the nature of disease and corresponding sacrifice to be made to heal the disease. ==Geography== Geographically the Malaa land lies approximately between 94-95 degree N latitude and 28-29 degree E longitude in Upper Siang district. The land of the Milangs extends to the Chage and Felo hills in the north which is land of the Idu tribe of Dibang valley. To south and the east they are bounded by the land of the Padams. Their land is a rich source of the Aconitum plant (variously known as monk's hood or wolf's bane), the source of the powerful poison aconitine, which the Milang historically used on their spears and arrows during battle.The Anglo- Abor wars between 1835 and 1912 saw massive use of EMO (called AMU in Millang) being supplied from Peki Modi village against the invading British forces. The principal rivers are Sidip, Yamne, Yammeng, Satamak and Chapel besides many rivulets flowing through their land. Millang, Dalbing and Peki Modi are the important ancestral villages of the Malaa. However, as of today they are found residing in the hills and the valleys of East Siang, Upper Siang and Lower Dibang Valley Districts of Arunachal Pradesh. ==Surnames== Surnames used by Malaa are based on family lineage. Common surnames include: * Ayom * Binggep * Bitin * Dalbong * Daltem * Dameng * Gamno * Langkam * Lego * Litin * Libang * Miew * Modi * Ngukir * Ngupok * Patuk Malaa bearing each surname are further subdivided into several clans.

In 1813, Mary Pickersgill sewed the famous Star Spangled Banner Flag in one of its malthouses. At the time, the brewery was owned by Baltimore merchant George I. Brown who had bought it from Edward Johnson, the third Mayor of Baltimore. George Brown sold the brewery to Eli Claggett in 1818, and until its final closure in 1879, it was known as Claggett's Brewery. The site once occupied by the brewery was excavated in 1983 as the Baltimore Center for Urban Archeology's first project. ==History== Edward Johnson (1767‚Äì1829), owner of the brewery prior to its sale to George Brown in 1813 The brewery, which for a while was known as The Baltimore Strong Beer Brewery, was founded in 1783 by Thomas Peters, who had come to Baltimore from Philadelphia to manufacture beer for the French and American troops during the American Revolution. Peters married Rebecca Johnson, the daughter of Baltimore physician Edward Johnson, in October 1783. Johnson later became a partner in his son-in-law's brewery business, and it was then called Peters, Johnson, and Company. When Edward Johnson died in 1797, his son, Edward Johnson Jr. (1767‚Äì1829), took over his father's share in the company and eventually became its sole owner.Flowers, Charles V.

However, according to Rob Kasper writing in The Baltimore Sun, the mayor found that simultaneously \\"brewing and governing\\" was too demanding and put the newly rebuilt brewery up for sale in 1813.Kasper, Rob (July 3, 2011). \\"Flags and beer: A Baltimore tradition\\".

The advertisement for the auction described the property as \\"the most complete establishment of its kind in the United States\\" and consisting of a brewhouse, two 100 by 30 feet malthouses with a granary over each, a brick counting house, a cooperage, a two-story dwelling, a stone coach house, and a stable.Kasper, Rob (2012). Baltimore Beer: A Satisfying History of Charm City Brewing, pp. 25‚Äì26. The History Press. George I. Brown, a local merchant, bought the brewery at the auction on July 14, 1813. He was an acquaintance of Mary Pickersgill, who had been commissioned by Colonel George Armistead in 1813 to make a large flag (30 by 42 feet) to fly over Fort McHenry. Pickersgill did not have adequate space in her house to assemble a flag of that size and lived only a block away from Brown's Brewery. Brown permitted her to assemble what became known as the Star Spangled Banner Flag on the floor of one of his malthouses. Brown had only limited success as a brewer and in 1818 sold the brewery to Eli Claggett, a former soldier wounded during the bombardment of Fort McHenry, who then operated it as Claggett's Brewery. In 1850 it produced 50,000 barrels of beer and was the largest of the city's 11 breweries. The Claggett family continued to run the brewery until 1879 when the business closed and the property was sold to the National Casket Company. The old brewery buildings, which were used to store caskets, were destroyed in the 1904 Great Baltimore Fire along with much of Baltimore's business district.O'Prey (2011) p. 55Arnett, Earl; Brugger, Robert J.; and Papenfuse, Edward C. (1999). Maryland: A New Guide to the Old Line State, p. 274. Johns Hopkins University Press. The corner on East Lombard Street which Brown's Brewery used to occupy later became known as Brewer's Park. A commemorative plaque was placed on the site, although it erroneously gave Claggett's name as the owner of the brewery when Mary Pickersgill assembled the flag. A similar anachronism appears in Robert McGill Mackall's 1976 painting, Mary Pickersgill Making the Star-Spangled Banner (on display at the Maryland Historical Society) which depicts several beer barrels in the background labelled \\"Claggett's Brewery\\". The site was acquired by the city of Baltimore in 1970 and in 1983 became the first project of the Baltimore Center for Urban Archeology. Much of the present knowledge about the brewery's history was the result of the project's archeological and archival research. The site is now occupied by a Marriott Hotel. ==Timeline== * 1812 ‚Äì Edward Johnson and Company Brewery burns down * 1813 ‚Äì Rebuilt by Johnson and sold to George Brown * 1813 ‚Äì Mary Pickersgill sews the famous Star Spangled Banner Flag in Brown's Brewery * 1818 ‚Äì George Brown sells the brewery to Eli Claggett * 1879 ‚Äì Claggett's Brewery closes ==See also== * List of defunct breweries in the United States ==Notes and references *Mary Pickersgill Making the Star-Spangled Banner, Robert McGill Mackall's 1976 painting depicting Mary Pickersgill in the brewery sewing the Star- Spangled Banner.

January 4, 2016. ==Location conflicts== Little Free Libraries may be designed and decorated to fit their surroundings or to stand out. Little Free Libraries are typically welcomed by communities; if zoning problems arise, however, local governments often work with residents to find solutions. In late 2012, the village of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, denied permission to potential Little Free Library projects and required that an existing Little Free Library be removed because of a village ordinance that prohibited structures in front yards. Village trustees also worried about inappropriate material being placed in the boxes. However, in August 2013, the village approved a new ordinance that specifically allowed Little Free Library boxes to be put up on private property. On June 17, 2015 Portland, Oregon Mayor Charlie Hales announced a major liberalization of public space when he declared it \\"Little Community Kiosk day\\". On that day, he and the Portland City Council unanimously established a new \\"encroachment\\" code, providing automatic permits and insurance coverage for every person who installs a community kiosk on either side of a public sidewalk and within the public right of way. The two sides are known as either a \\"furnishing strip\\" or \\"frontage strip\\". The ordinance provides height, width, and setback guidelines that also address certain ADA requirements related to detection by walking sticks used by alter-abled people. As of that date, every residential block is able to feature installations of a widest possible spectrum of interactive kiosks, including libraries. This was partly approved as a means to fight youth gang violence. Shortly afterward members of three gangs in North Portland participated in the design, construction, and installation of one hundred-fifty little libraries located in public spaces. The number was established to honor the 150th anniversary of Portland's public library system. In June 2014, city officials in Leawood, Kansas shut down a Little Free Library under a city ordinance prohibiting detached structures. The family of the nine-year-old boy who built the structure created a Facebook page to support the amendment of Leawood's city code. Another resident of the city who erected a Little Free Library was threatened with a $25 fine. In July, the city council unanimously approved a temporary moratorium to permit Little Free Libraries on private property. On January 29, 2015, the Metropolitan Planning Commission in Shreveport, Louisiana shut down a Little Free Library. Zoning administrator Alan Clarke said that city ordinances permitted libraries only in commercial zones and that the one that was shut down had ‚Äúbothered someone.‚Äù The following month, the city council temporarily legalized book exchange boxes until the zoning ordinances could be amended to permanently allow them. In North America, Little Free Libraries, and, implicitly, other public bookcases, have been criticized for being placed mostly in neighborhoods of wealthier, well- educated people, where there are already high-quality traditional public libraries nearby. The commentator encourages groups to assist neighborhoods where such facilities are lacking. ==Little Free Pantries and Blessing Boxes== As of June 2019, the United States had more than 600 Little Free Pantries, and more can be found in Canada, The Netherlands and Australia. The Little Pantries function similarly to the libraries, as places where anyone can bring food and anyone can take food. Personal hygiene items such as soap and toothbrushes are also distributed. The first Little Free Pantry opened May 12, 2016 in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Another 100 were installed within months, including pantries in New Zealand. Items not allowed, according to informal rules, include razors, alcohol, and breakable glass containers. Blessing Boxes, which are similar to the Little Free Pantries, are often sponsored by churches. They provide a place for sharing food and other useful goods, such as clothing. People are encouraged to \\"pay it forward\\" and donate whatever they can, such as a can of beans. \\"The idea is that anyone walking by who may be struggling can use the goods to make ends meet and get through the day.\\" ==See also== * Public bookcase, for history and generic aspects of the practice ==References * Official website * Little Free Library World Map *Sampling of creative LFL ideas shared on Pinterest including repurposed pay phone, newspaper boxes, file cabinets * Little Free Libraries Around Buffalo, NY: Mapped because most are not registered and don't appear on the official map Category:Non-profit organizations based in Wisconsin Category:Book swapping Category:2009 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Organizations established in 2009 ","title":"Little Free Library"},{"id":"35838713","text":"Metcalf Ross ( ‚Äì 2 January 1858) was an English master printer and sometime poet/songwriter in Tyneside.

It was probably built in the early 1740s for a local merchant and in 1759 it was purchased by Charles Gregory Fairfax, 9th Viscount Fairfax of Emley, who arranged for the interior to be remodelled by John Carr (architect). After the Viscount's death in 1772, the house was sold and subsequently passed through a number of local families before spending some time as a Gentleman's Club, a Building Society and a cinema. The property was bought by York Civic Trust in the 1980s and completely restored to its former grandeur. Fairfax House is now a museum open to the public and a Grade I listed building. ==History== In 1761, Viscount Fairfax employed the Yorkshire architect John Carr to remodel the house at 27 Castlegate. The work was completed in 1765. The interior has some of Yorkshire's finest mid-C18 plasterwork by James Henderson (fl. c. 1755‚Äì1778) and Giuseppe (Joseph) Cortese (fl. c. 1745‚Äì1778) and carved woodwork. The wrought iron balustrades on the staircases were by Maurice Tobin (fl. 1762) Wrought iron gates and railings fronting Castlegate were removed when the street was widened, but were recorded by York architect and artist Ridsdale Tait. upright=0.9 Viscount Fairfax died in 1772 and his title became extinct. Subsequent occupants included Sir Walter Vavasour, 6th Baronet of Haslewood (1780), William Danby (1787), Peregrine Wentworth (1792), Sir John Lister Kaye, 1st Baronet Lister-Kaye of Grange (1820) and Mrs Ann Mary Pemberton (1840‚Äì65).Fairfax House, Castlegate, description by York Conservation Trust At some point after this, Fairfax House, renamed St. George‚Äôs Hall, became neglected and fell into disrepair, and in the late 19th and early 20th century, part of the property was used as a dance hall. In 1921, St George's Cinema, adjacent to Fairfax House, was opened and the building was expanded. It closed in 1970 and the City Council acquired the dilapidated building. The City sold it to York Civic Trust, which between 1982 and 1984 under architect Francis Johnson renovated the building and turned the defunct cinema's entrance into the main entrance to Fairfax House. The York Conservation Trust subsequently purchased the house, leasing it back to the Civic Trust. On the death in 1980 of Noel Terry (of the Terry's chocolate business), his collection of Georgian furniture and clocks was donated to York Civic Trust and subsequently housed in the period rooms of Fairfax House. The collection has since been expanded by acquisition and donation, including in summer 2017 a re-discovered wooden panel carved by Grinling Gibbons while learning his trade in York. York Civic Trust headquarters is in the house, which is open for the public to see the rooms and exhibitions. ==Gallery== File:Fairfax House Kitchen.jpgThe Kitchen File:Fairfax House Saloon.jpgThe Saloon File:Fairfax House Drawing Room.jpgThe Drawing Room File:Fairfax House Viscount Bedroom.jpgThe Viscount Bedroom File:Fairfax House Annes Bedroom.jpgAnnes Bedroom File:Fairfax House Stairs.jpgThe main stairs File:Fairfax House Corridor.jpgCorridor inside File:Fairfax House Dining Room.jpgThe Dining Room File:Fairfax House Library.jpgThe Library ==References *Fairfax House website Category:Grade I listed buildings in York Category:Museums in York Category:Historic house museums in North Yorkshire ","title":"Fairfax House"},{"id":"35838762","text":"Whelchel is a surname.

One significant aspect of the Pathfinder series is its uniquely complex but well documented set of time travel rules. == Plot == The narrative follows the adventures of a young man named Rigg, an unknowing colonist of a planet called Garden in a seemingly medieval state of scientific advancement. Rigg, at first a fur trapper's apprentice who has been educated in nearly every skill by a mysterious figure claiming to be his father, prominently exhibits a seemingly magical ability to see \\"paths\\" (hence the series' title), or the physical traces of living entities through time, to his benefit. Rigg and his companions, a band of unlikely friends, young and old, who have similar time-altering abilities, travel across Garden through many varied societies and environments to use their talents for personal benefit and heroics.

Some readers did complain that the ending of the series did feel \\"lazy\\" or weak, the writing uneven.

The Bar offers Continuing Legal Education and other member and public services. Membership numbers more than 4,000. The association is also responsible for administering the bar examination for the State. The Bar offers several membership categories, including active in-state, active out-of-state, inactive, senior and retired. ==History== The Association was founded in November 1896 in Juneau.https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044031785215 Admission was dependent on a vote by the board of directors and payment of a fee of $1. The association did not address matters involving attorney misconduct. The most severe punishment was expulsion from the club. The only action that would invoke suspension or expulsion was non-adherence to the minimum fee schedule. Potential cases of lawyer misconduct were referred to the U.S. Attorney's office for investigation, then to the grand jury for indictment and finally to the territorial court for adjudication. United States v. Stringer124 F. Supp. 705 (D. Alaska 1954), rev'd 233 F.2d 947 (9th Cir. 1956) instituted the Association. The case demonstrated how little power lawyers had in the territorial legal system and that cases and professional conduct were judged by the same jurist. This was a source of concern over judicial bias and overreach. In 1955, the territorial legislature introduced The Alaska Integrated Bar Act of 1955, creating the Alaska Bar Association, a territory- wide organization that would govern the profession.http://jukebox.uaf.edu/site7/sites/default/files/documents/ak_law_review_article.pdf The first bar president, M.E. Monagle, was elected in 1955.https://alaskabar.org/wp-content/uploads/President-historical-list.pdf The first 65 years of the association's history invested eight bar presidents: *Wilfred Stump, Ketchikan (1958-1959) *Keith Brown, Juneau (1975-1976) *Mary Hughes, Kodiak (1983-1984) *Ralph Beistline, Fairbanks (1986-1987) *Dan Winfree, Fairbanks (1994-1995) *John Tiemessen, Fairbanks (2006-2007) *Sid Billingslea, Soldotna (2009-2010) *Darrel Gardner, Anchorage (2017-2018) In October 1972, the Board of Governors established the Alaska Bar Foundation as a 501(c)(3) corporation. The Foundation strives to foster and maintain the honor and integrity of the legal profession. It is governed by seven trustees. It administers the Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program, in accordance with rules established by the Alaskan Supreme Court. By joining IOLTA, attorneys‚Äô unsegregated trust accounts generate interest income, which is sent to the Foundation to be used for grants to programs that provide civil legal services to low-income Alaskans. ==Structure== The Board of Governors consists of 12 members, nine attorneys and three citizens. The nine attorneys are elected by their peers. Serving three-year staggered terms, two attorneys represent the First Judicial District, which includes Juneau and southeast Alaska; four are from the Third Judicial District, which includes Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and the Kenai Peninsula; two members serve the Second and Fourth Judicial Districts, which includes Fairbanks and northwest Alaska; and one member is elected at-large. The three citizen members are appointed by the governor and are subject to legislative confirmation. They serve staggered three-year terms. Vacancies are appointed by the board until the next election. The board meets 5-6 times a year at dates and places designated by the president. Special meetings may be called by the president or three Board members. Typically in May, the board elects a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. The association employs an executive director. ==Finance== The Association is a non-profit funded by license fees paid by the state's lawyers. It generates additional revenue through on-line and live Continuing Legal Education courses, referrals and investments. ==Services Lawyers === The Association implements the rules for admitting attorneys to the practice of law through biannual bar exams and annual re-licensing. The Bar Counsel investigates and prosecutes claims of attorney misconduct, as specified in the Alaska Bar Rules and Alaska Rules of Professional Responsibility. Disciplinary orders are ultimately imposed by the Alaska Supreme Court. Member services include: *Continuing Legal Education on legal topics and ethical matters. Alaska lawyers are required to complete at least three hours of ethics training per year and are encouraged to obtain at least nine hours of other CLE. *Bar Counsel provides informal advice to lawyers with questions about ethics. Ethics Opinions are available online. *Telephonic Lawyer Referral Service. All lawyers are active Bar members in good standing. *Lawyers' Assistance Committee that promotes the legal profession and protects the public by providing education, respectful confidential assistance and referrals for members of the Bar, their families, colleagues, and clients affected by a member's mental health and substance abuse issues. *The SOLACE Program assists anyone within the Alaska legal community (lawyers, law office personnel, judges or courthouse employees) who suffers a catastrophic loss due to an unexpected event, illness or injury, through voluntary contributions and networking. *31 voluntary associations (Sections) of attorneys who are interested in a single topic, such as Alaska Native Law and Arctic Law. The Sections have regular meetings and often host their own CLE presentations. *The Alaska Bar Rag is a quarterly print and on- line newsletter. It offers irreverent and topical content representing the Alaskan legal community. *The Alaska Bar Convention is an annual 2.5-day event hosted in Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks. The convention features CLE courses, luncheons with award ceremonies, a banquet, and the inauguration of the new Bar president. ===Public=== The Alaska Bar Association provides services to the public, including: *Forms and instructions for filing complaints against lawyers *An online database for searching for public discipline records *A guided procedure and process for resolving attorney/client fee disputes *A Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection to reimburse clients who have been financially harmed by their attorney's professional misconduct. *Guides and information on topics such as Seniors & the Law; the Alaska Youth Law Guide; Pro Bono Legal Service Providers; Unbundled Legal Services; Domestic Violence Protective Orders; Client's Rights and Responsibilities *Alaska Free Legal Answers, an online service for low- income Alaskans; self-Help services; and a guide to legal resource websites. *A free telephonic Lawyer Referral Service organized by topic, such as real estate, adoption, etc. Members of the public can receive contact information for lawyers practicing in specific areas. Lawyers who enroll in the Lawyer Referral Service agree to charge no more than $125 for the first half-hour of consultation. *An annual free clinic on Martin Luther King Jr. Day enrolls volunteer lawyers from across the state to provide legal advice on issues including landlord/tenant disputes, family law matters, wills and estates, and public benefits issues. ==See also== * Legal education in Alaska ==References== Category:American state bar associations Category:Organizations established in 1972 Category:Organizations based in Alaska Category:1972 establishments in Alaska ","title":"Alaska Bar Association"},{"id":"35838791","text":"Heteropsis anganavo is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Aumund nowadays has around 390 employees, 10 branches worldwide and a wide network of local representatives. ==Foundation and History== Prof. Dr.-Ing. Heinrich Aumund founded Aumund F√∂rdertechnik GmbH 3 August 1922 in Berlin. Numerous patents were filed in the field of conveying and transport technology in the course of his research and engineering activity at the Technical College of Danzig, as well as at the Technical College of Berlin, enabling Heinrich Aumund to rapidly develop the company. From 1951 his son G√ºnter-Claus Aumund took over management of the company. In 1957 production was moved to Rheinberg-Millingen. After the death of G√ºnter-Claus Aumund in 1984 the third generation came into force, seeing Franz-Walter Aumund in charge. The company was expanded worldwide. Already in 1975 the subsidiary ‚ÄúAUMUND do Brasil‚Äú was established in Rio de Janeiro and ‚ÄûAUMUND International‚Äú in Toronto. By 1977 AUMUND had established 14 subsidiaries and main representative offices worldwide. Among these were subsidiaries in Australia, Finland, Greece and South Africa. In 2001 Gustav Schade Maschinenfabrik was acquired by the AUMUND Group, through which Aumund extended its product range with products from the field of bulk materials and storage technology. One year later the British company B&W; was acquired. B&W; is specialised in bulk material mobile loading and unloading equipment. Aumund said farewell to crane technology, once a core competence, in 1995. In 1984 the company was officially honoured by Federal President Karl Carstens for its ‚Äúexemplary service to young people‚Äôs professional training‚Äú. In 2006 the Franz-W. Aumund Foundation was established which awards Heinrich-Aumund- Scholarships to students at the TU Berlin as well as at the Fachhochschule Koblenz with excellent study achievements related to design and conveying technology. ==Products== AUMUND offers the whole range of conveying technology. *Vertical chain bucket elevators for the transport of difficult and hot materials *Vertical belt bucket elevators for the conveying of fine materials *Apron conveyors and complete cement clinker transport systems *Heavy-duty apron conveyors for raw material handling *Apron weigh-feeders for controlled mill feeding *Silo discharge systems *Special silo clearing systems for cement clinker ==Literature== * Heinrich Coopmann: Aumund - Three Generations, three emphases.

(2008). \\"Commercial Diplomacy: A Conceptual Overview.\\" Conference paper for the 7th World Conference of TPOs ‚Äì The Hague, The Netherlands. It aims at generating commercial gains in the form of trade and inward and outward investment by means of business and entrepreneurship promotion and facilitation activities in the host country.Ruel, H. J. M. and Visser, R. (2012). \\"Commercial Diplomats as corporate entrepreneurs: explaining role behavior from an institutional perspective\\", International Journal of Diplomacy and Economy.

M., \\"Research on Commercial Diplomacy: Review and Implications\\" in Commercial Diplomacy and International Business: a conceptual and empirical exploration, Ruel, H. J. M., ed. (Advanced series in Management, Emerald, 2012). As a term, commercial diplomacy emerged in the second half of the twentieth century (e.g., Joseph, 1965; Corbet, 1972), but the concept certainly existed in previous centuries. In literature the concepts of economic diplomacy and commercial diplomacy are often used interchangeably. Definitions of both concepts vary, and consequently the relationship between them is also described differently. Some authors argue that commercial diplomacy is a subset of economic diplomacy.Okano-Heijmans, M., and Ruel, H. (2011). \\"Commerci√´le diplomatie en internationaal ondernemen: Koopman versus dominee in de nieuwe economische wereldorde\\", International Spectator, 65(9), 463-467. It is certain, however, that both kinds of diplomacy are \\"irrevocably intertwined\\" and thus \\"distinct [but] obviously closely related to [each other]\\".Berridge, G. J., A Dictionary of Diplomacy (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001): p. 128. ==Purpose== Commercial diplomacy emphasizes the government's role, being defined as \\"a government service to the business community, which aims at the development of socially beneficial international business ventures\\".Kotabe, M., and Czinkota, M.

Commercial diplomacy thus includes \\"all aspects of business support and promotion\\" including investment, tourism, R&D;, and intellectual property.Naray, O. (2010). \\"What a good Commercial Diplomat has to know and be capable of\\", Exchange: The Magazine for International Business and Diplomacy, 2 (December 2010): 8-9. Commercial diplomacy is designed to influence foreign government policy and regulatory decisions that affect global trade, investment and commerce. It is concerned with government regulations and actions that affect international commerce‚Äîincluding standards in areas such as health, safety, the environment, and consumer protection; regulations covering services such as banking, telecommunications and accounting; competition policy and laws concerning bribery and corruption; agricultural support programs; and industrial subsidies. Potter (2004) argues that commercial diplomacy is a value-creating activity due to its usefulness in dealing with managerial and government concerns. In this context, commercial diplomacy is profitable in that it makes exporting and operating abroad easier; it is a valuable instrument for export promotion and operating abroad; it enables companies to perform tasks abroad more quickly and increases the amount of exports and company results by providing information about rules, regulations, culture, public tenders and the market of the host country; by providing support during the partner search; and by providing assistance in trade disputes, fairs, and missions. Especially for companies that have financial limitations, access to reliable information and a broad network abroad are essential.Busschers, S.

For many years this was considered a lost film, but in 2013 a copy was discovered in the basement of the surrogate court of New York City. Two of seven cans of the movie were deteriorated beyond hope, but five survived and are at the George Eastman House film archive for restoration. ==Plot== An unknown soldier (Errol Flynn) relates the story of four young men who are killed at the Battle of Anzio before they go into Heaven.

The movie was originally entitled Before You Sleep Tonight and Flynn agreed to own a half interest in the film in exchange for a promissory note worth $25,000 signed in July 1949. Flynn made the movie in Italy in late 1949 on the way back from India, where he had been filming Kim.Thomas McNulty, Errol Flynn: The Life and Career, McFarland, p242 accessed 22 November 2012 He worked on it for ten days and Flynn says his fee was $2,700 a day. ==Legal dispute== Flynn was unhappy with the quality of the final product and while making another film with Marshall in Paris, Adventures of Captain Fabian, he arranged for a friend of his, Charles Gross, to obtain the original negative of Hello God. Marshall reconstructed the film using out- takes and additional footage shot in Santa Barbara. Marshall said at the time: > Flynn doesn't look his best in some of the rejected shots but we'll have to > use them unless his man coughs up the good ones. I like Flynn as well as > anybody, but in business he's pretty difficult. Somebody must be giving him > bad advice. I haven't been able to get in touch with him lately... Everybody > who has seen it says it's a wonderful picture and Flynn does things in it he > has never done before. He prays to God and he cries on the beach at Anzio. Flynn's manager at the time, Al Blum, insisted that Marshall would not get the footage back: > He represented to Flynn that he had a feature picture which needed only > Flynn's appearance in the Italian scenes and a commentary by Flynn to > complete it. But what he really has is a hodgepodge of junk ‚Äì old newsreels, > clips from other pictures, bad photography, no quality ‚Äì it's just terrible. > And, also, I'm a little afraid of its political aspects ‚Äì although I don't > want to make any positive charges. At all costs Flynn will block the release > ‚Äì by court action if necessary. William Marshall then sued Flynn for collection on the promissory note which had been signed in exchange for a half interest in the film. Flynn countersued, asking for the court to cancel the note and his partnership agreement with Marshall. He claimed that: *When he entered into the agreement to make the film he did not know it would be detrimental to the public welfare in that it was of a pacifist nature and contrary to the policy of the United States and other countries opposed to Communist aggression; *Marshall fraudulently represented that he had spent more than $50,000 on the production already, that the musical background had been scored and had been written by a conductor of distinction, and that the film could be expanded from being a documentary to a full-length drama; *The film was of inferior quality because of the poor film stock used and poor sound recording.Flynn lost the case and in 1957 was ordered to pay $31,750 to William Marshall, plus $2,500 in legal costs. Marshall later claimed he had lent Flynn $180,000 when the actor was in financial trouble. The movie was never released commercially, but a partial copy related to Marshall's legal troubles was discovered in 2013. ==References * ","title":"Hello God"},{"id":"35838979","text":"Inside the premier league is a TV program that airs Monday through Thursday on Abu Dhabi Sports Channel (Abu Dhabi sports 3) that shows the latest news of the English premiership.

Haughton, the son of a doctor, was educated in England before travelling to India in 1808 to take up a position in Bengal as a military cadet in the service of the East India Company. He became proficient in Hindustani and entered Fort William College in Calcutta to further his knowledge of oriental languages, winning several prizes. Ill-health caused by over-exerting himself in study caused him to return home in 1815. Two years later, he was appointed as an assistant professor at the East India College, Haileybury; he held the post of professor of Sanskrit and Bengali from 1819 to 1827, publishing instructional works in Bengali. He was awarded an honorary degree of Master of Arts by the University of Oxford in 1819, elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1821, and was a member of other learned institutions in Europe and India, including the Royal Asiatic Society which he helped to found. In 1833, he was created a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order. He was supported by various prominent academics when he attempted in 1832 to be elected as the first Boden Professor of Sanskrit, but he stood down from the contest in favour of Horace Hayman Wilson, a decision which won him acclaim from many Oxford scholars and graduates. He published articles on various topics, including Sanskrit prepositions, the cause of cholera, and cause and effect as seen in Hindu and European thought. He died of cholera in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud, where he had resided towards the end of his life, on 28 August 1849.

The NewFM Division is the 2nd tier of Football in Northern New South Wales Football below the NBN State Football League. ==History== Over the years, doubt has been expressed about the birth of soccer in Cessnock. To get down to the basic truths, Sid Grant, a well known historian, undertook a detailed research including personal interviews with old Bob Harden (ex-West Wallsend skipper), Tom Rennex, ‚ÄòG ‚ÄòTup‚Äô‚Äô Rennex, Alf Brunskill, Alec Renfrew and others. But the truth of this problem came out when a former Secretary of the NDBFA, Mr George Reay of Dudley, presented Sid with both the official minute book and registrar of players book for the period 1902‚Äì1911. This indicated clearly that soccer started in Cessnock in April, 1907. A group of 15 sportsmen met on a vacant allotment just south of the Cessnock railway station. Many of these enthusiasts were recent arrivals from Minmi, West Wallsend, Greta and Stockton. The first ground was a large vacant area near where the Aberdare Park was established 15 years later. 2007 saw Cessnock celebrate 100 years of football.http://www.cessnockhornetsfc.com.au/history.htm ==Home Ground== Cessnock play their home games at the Hornets Ground, Turner Park Complex, Aberdare Road, Aberdare.

Both of the clubs have enjoyed success at the top of local football over their histories and have always had that extra spark in the games where these 2 clubs meet in any Grade/Age as you do with games between two rival football clubs. The Hornets also have a big local rivalry with Singleton Strikers. Cessnock share a somewhat local rivalry with Maitland Magpies too, who now currently play in the Northern NSW NPL. ==Worthy Mention== The end of the Hornets 2013 season saw the retirement of Andrew O'Hearn (nickname: Kanga ) a Cessnock City Hornets Football Club life member, a former Newcastle Breakers player, and Hornets 1st Grade Captain who ended his footballing career with 414 senior caps for the Hornets. ==Notable Former Players== Cessnock has had many players go on to represent Australia at a junior and senior level including * Cliff Almond * John Barr * Les Brown * Jack Drinkwater * Jack Evans * Jim Harden * Lo Hearne * Eddie Hodge * Jack Lennard * Perce Lennard * William Lonergan * Roy McNaughton * Amber Neilson * Kevin O'Neill * Jim Orr * Greg Owens * Phil Peters * John Pettigrew * Alec Purdon * John Roberts * George Rowe * George Russell * Lorisssa Stevens * Jack Taylor * Cec Williams * Ern Williams * Clayton Zane * Mitchell Killen http://www.cessnockhornetsfc.com.au/history.htm ==References== Category:Soccer clubs in New South Wales ","title":"Cessnock City Hornets FC"},{"id":"35839115","text":"V.R.Krishnan Ezhuthachan (1909‚Äì2004) was an Indian freedom fighter, Gandhian, journalist, trade unionist and Indian National Congress leader from Thrissur city in Kerala, India.

The daily's circulation was given as 93,000 by Western media observers in 2002. The estimated circulation of the paper in 2003 was 80,000 copies. Its 2007 circulation figure is given to be 110,000 by World Association of Newspapers. The confirmed circulation of the paper is reported to be more than 131,000 copies in June 2008. The circulation of the daily, which was confirmed by the BPA, was 125,415 copies for the last six months of 2011. For the first six-month period of 2013 the paper had a circulation of 123,097 copies. ==Influence and awards== It is argued that Al Jazirah is one of four leading Saudi daily newspapers along with Al Watan, Al Riyadh and Al Madina. At the beginning of the 1990s, Al Jazirah and Al Riyadh competed against each other to be more influential than the other. The paper was awarded the best print prize in Asia by IFRA in Manila in 2007 and its website was awarded the digital excellence award by the Saudi Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in 2007. In addition, the editors of the paper were invited by the World Association of Newspapers to its 2007 conference held in South Africa. It was the first invitation of the association for a Saudi daily. ==Content == Al Jazirah usually publishes reports and interviews concerning national, Arab and international issues. The paper is mostly known for its daily supplements on different topics such as economy, sports, culture, computers, medicine and science. It also has a weekly supplement, Telecom and Digital World. It also carries cartoons. The Arab Press Network states that the paper extensively covers the activities of the ruling Saudi family and adopts an uncritical approach towards the government's policies on most of its 60 daily pages. It is further discussed that its columnists and the debate they initiate are both weak. Then minister of health Ghazi Al Gosaibi's poem written for King Fahd, entitled \\"A Pen Bought and Sold\\", was published on the front page of the paper in 1984. In the poem, Al Gosaibi indirectly accused the ruling elites, including Prince Sultan, then Minister of Defence, of corruption and Saudi Oger of improper tender activities regarding the public hospitals. King Fahd fired him after reading the poem. On 3 and 10 January 2002, a commentary by Muhammad bin Saad al Shuwayir was published in the paper. The commentary was entitled \\"Why Pork Is Forbidden?‚Äù. The author said that the transformation of the Jews into apes and pigs was a punishment \\"because monkeys and pigs were considered among the lowliest of animals, in nature and manners\\". He further stated that Jews always represent the human lowness, as expressed in Quran. Jasser Abdulaziz al Jasser, a columnist of Al Jazirah, criticised Russia, especially Sergey Lavrov, for supporting Assad regime's Alawite minority rule over a Sunni majority in Syria on 24 March 2012. Al Jasser argued that the same tactics used by Russia to oppress Muslim majority in Chechnya and the Caucasus were employed by Assad to oppress Sunni majority in Syria. Al Jazirah's front page on 17 June 2012 was entirely in black and white, showing photographs of King Abdullah and late Crown Prince Nayef, who died in Geneva on 16 June 2012. ==Controversy== In September 2008, a reporter of the paper, Fahd al Jukhaidib, wrote an article in which he described frequent power cuts in Qubba in northern Saudi Arabia. The article also informed the readers about a protest in front of the government-owned electricity company as a result of power cuts experienced. Upon publication of his article, he was sentenced in October 2008 to two months in prison and 50 lashes for inciting the public to protest against a series of electric power reductions. He was free on appeal in 2009. ==Innovation== Al Jazirah seems not to be conservative in terms of using technology to provide advanced technological platforms to its readers. The paper is the first Saudi daily in launching online website that was formed in 1996. It is also the first daily paper in the Middle East to launch mobile phone application which had more than 50,000 users in 2013. In addition to these technological innovations, Al Jazirah is also innovative in launching first online women's daily covering female achievements in Saudi Arabia, latest developments and other topics related to women. In 2013, the daily cooperated with Goss International for press upgrade, refurbishment and relocation venture. ==See also== *List of newspapers in Saudi Arabia ==References== Category:1960 establishments in Saudi Arabia Category:Publications established in 1960 Category:Arabic-language newspapers Category:Newspapers published in Saudi Arabia Category:Arab mass media Category:Mass media in Riyadh ","title":"Al Jazirah (newspaper)"},{"id":"35839219","text":"is an English trusts law case concerning receipt of property in breach of trust. ==Facts== Mr Murad, an investment manager held El Ajou‚Äôs money but was bribed to invest in fraudulent share selling operations run by three Canadians.

The action was a personal action only available in respect of money, rather than other benefits. Where the benefit received by the defendant was services or goods, the appropriate action was a quantum meruit or a quantum valebant, respectively. The action for money had and received formed a part of the law of quasi-contract. Although the forms of action were abolished in the mid-19th century, reference continues to be made to the action in modern pleading.Cf.

He was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Descamps at the Rouen School of Fine Arts, then of Joseph-Marie Vien, where he had as classmates and friends Jacques-Louis David and Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent. With a pleasing appearance, much natural wit and excellent recommendations he was soon admitted into the best society in the capital, especially in the salon of Marie Th√©r√®se Rodet Geoffrin, who took a liking to him. In 1772 he exhibited The Children of Niobe killed by Apollo and Diana, a work that won him the Prix de Rome. He lived in Rome, as a licensee of the Government, from 1774 to 1784. In this country of the arts, Lemonnier found a home full of kindness with the famous poet diplomat, Cardinal de Bernis, and devoted himself with enthusiasm to the study of masterpieces of the masters, from which he drew inspiration for the design and composition that is distinctive of his talent. Back in France, Lemonnier returned to his hometown where he painted one of his best pictures, the Plague of Milan, for the chapel of the Seminary of Saint-Vivien. In 1786, during the visit of Louis XVI to Rouen on his return from Cherbourg, Lemonnier was commissioned to paint a picture whose subject was the presentation of the members of the Rouen Chamber of Commerce to the monarch. Soon after, he performed for the same company a large allegorical painting representing the engineering trade and the discovery of America. In 1789 Lemonnier was named to the Academy of Painting for his work la Mort d‚ÄôAntoine (the Death of Anthony). During the French Revolution, Lemonnier was called to be part of the Committee on Monuments, and in 1794 he obtained the title of the cabinet painter of the School of Medicine. Related to Roland, on 4 December 1792 Lemonnier received from the minister a position at the Louvre which placed him on the Arts Commission, where he rendered great service. In Rouen he was charged, with his compatriot Charles Le Carpentier, to examine art works removed from suppressed religious institutions in the district and select those that should avoid destruction. He discharged this critical mission with great zeal, and it is due to Lemonnier that several churches and the museum of Rouen now possess many of the best paintings he managed to collect. In 1810 Lemonnier became director of the Gobelins Manufactory, a position he lost in 1816. He also took an active part in establishing the Museum of Fine Arts of Rouen. He died in Paris on 17 August 1824. Lemonnier's son was a man of letters who wrote, among other things, a historical record of the life and works of A.-C.-G. Lemonnier. Lemonnier's portrait is in the collection of Rouen Library. ==Works== The best known of Lemonnier's works is without doubt An Evening with Madame Geoffrin, executed in 1812 for the Empress Josephine. This painting exhibited at the Mus√©e des Ch√¢teaux de Malmaison et Bois-Pr√©au is an imaginary reconstruction of the salon of Marie Th√©r√®se Rodet Geoffrin depicting, among others, the ministers Choiseul, Fontenelle, Montesquieu, Diderot and Marmontel, their hostess and a bust of Voltaire in a scene where the actor Lekain is reading Voltaire's play L‚ÄôOrphelin de la Chine (The Orphan of China).

They were used as main guns on the most typical frigates of the early 18th century, on the second deck of fourth-rate ships of the line, and on the upper decks or castles of 80-gun and 120-gun ships of the line. Naval 12-pounders were similar to 12-pound Army guns in the Gribeauval system: the canon lourd de 12 Gribeauval, used as a siege weapon, and the canon de 12 Gribeauval, which was considered a heavy field artillery piece. == Usage == As the 12-pounder calibre was consistent with both the French and the British calibre systems, it was a widespread gun amongst nations between the 17th and the 19th century. From the late 18th Century, the French Navy used the 12-pounder in three capacities: as main gun on early frigates under Louis XIV, on standard frigates under Louis XV and on light frigates under Louis XVI; as secondary artillery on 64-gun ships; to arm the castles of 80-gun ships of the line; and to equip the third deck of early first-rate ships. Under Louis XIV, frigates were organised into \\"first-rank frigates\\", which were small two-deckers comparable in role to the 60-gun ships of the 19th century, and smaller \\"second-rank\\" frigates. The first-rank frigates carried the 12-pounder as main artillery on their lower deck. Later, under Louis XV, the frigate took its modern shape with a single artillery deck complemented by smaller pieces on the castles; new heavy frigates were developed to carry 26 12-pounders, with Hermione as lead ship of the series. Hermione was captured by the British in 1757 and was swiftly imitated. Breakthrough towards fielding heavier guns were made in 1772, when the two units of the Pourvoyeuse class were built, with 24-pounders intended, but 18-pounders used in practice, and the 12-pounder remained the standard issue on most units. Under Louis XVI, the heavier 18-pounder frigate became predominant, with over 130 units produced, but the French Navy still had around 70 lighter 12-pounder frigates in commission. On 64-gun two-deckers, the 12-gun was used as secondary artillery, to supplement the 24-pounder main batteries. 28 guns were carried on the top gun-deck. Larger units used the 12-pounder to complement the firepower provided by their main and secondary artillery. On 80-gun ships of the Tonnant class and Bucentaure class, they armed the forecastle and the poop deck. On capital ships, the 12-pounder was used on the third deck from the reign of Louis XIV, with units like Royal Louis or Soleil-Royal as typical examples. While the secondary artillery of these 100-gun ships evolved from 18-pounders to 24-pounders, the 12-pounder remained the standard gun on the third deck until 1803, when the Oc√©an class ship Imp√©rial became the first 120-gun to carry 18-pounders on her third battery. In the Royal Navy, the 12-pounder was used in a similar capacity. The capture of Hermione in 1757 encouraged the British to imitate her design, yielding the Southampton class and Richmond class frigates. The 12-pounder also equipped the castles on razeed ships, where 12 pieces were mounted, and the 22-gun secondary battery of 50-gun fourth-rates. Finally, 30 were installed on the third deck of 90-gun second-rates. == Sources and references == * Jean Boudriot et Hubert Berti, L'Artillerie de mer : marine fran√ßaise 1650-1850, Paris, √©ditions Ancre, 1992 () (notice BNF no FRBNF355550752). * Jean Peter, L'artillerie et les fonderies de la marine sous Louis XIV, Paris, Economica, 1995, 213 p.

These are called duplex (or austenitic-ferritic) grades because their metallurgical structure consists of two phases, austenite (face- centered cubic lattice) and ferrite (body centered cubic lattice) in roughly equal proportions. They are designed to provide better corrosion resistance, particularly chloride stress corrosion and chloride pitting corrosion, and higher strength than standard austenitic stainless steels such as Type 304 or 316. The main differences in composition, when compared with an austenitic stainless steel is that the duplex steels have a higher chromium content, 20‚Äì28%; higher molybdenum, up to 5%; lower nickel, up to 9% and 0.05‚Äì0.50% nitrogen. Both the low nickel content and the high strength (enabling thinner sections to be used) give significant cost benefits. They are therefore used extensively in the offshore oil and gas industry for pipework systems, manifolds, risers, etc and in the petrochemical industry in the form of pipelines and pressure vessels. In addition to the improved corrosion resistance compared with the 300 series stainless steels duplex steels also have higher strength. For example, a Type 304 stainless steel has a 0.2% proof strength in the region of 280N/, a 22%Cr duplex stainless steel a minimum 0.2% proof strength of some 450N/ and a superduplex grade a minimum of 550N/. == Grades of duplex stainless steels == Microstructures of four kinds of duplex stainless steel in each direction Duplex stainless steels are usually divided into three groups based on their pitting corrosion resistance, characterised by the pitting resistance equivalence number, . ; Standard duplex (PREN range 28‚Äì38): Typically Grade EN 1.4462 (also called 2205). It is typical of the mid-range of properties and is perhaps the most used today ; Super-duplex (PREN range 38-45): Typically grade EN 1.4410 up to so-called hyper duplex grades (PREN: >45) developed later to meet specific demands of the oil and gas as well as those of the chemical industries. They offer a superior corrosion resistance and strength but are more difficult to process because the higher contents of Cr, Ni, Mo, N and even W promote the formation of intermetallic phases, which reduce drastically the impact resistance of the steel. Faulty processing will result in poor performance and users are advised to deal with reputable suppliers/processors. Applications include deepwater offshore oil production. ; Lean duplex grades (PREN range 22‚Äì27): Typically grade EN 1.4362, have been developed more recently for less demanding applications, particularly in the building and construction industry. Their corrosion resistance is closer to that of the standard austenitic grade EN 1.4401 (with a plus on resistance to stress corrosion cracking) and their mechanical properties are higher. This can be a great advantage when strength is important. This is the case in bridges, pressure vessels or tie bars. == Chemical compositions == Chemicals composition of grades from EN 10088-1 (2014) Standard are given in the table below: {  + Composition by weight (%) - !

Since appearing in Europe in the 16th century, the Beau Sancy has been owned by a number of European royal houses, among them the House of Medici and the Kings of England and Prussia. After 370 years in the possession of the House of Hohenzollern, the diamond was sold in 2012 at Sotheby's auction in Geneva for $9.57 million to an anonymous buyer. ==History== The Beau Sancy comes from the famous diamond mines around Golconda, now in the Indian state of Telangana. Like its sibling diamond, the Sancy, it is part of the stones collectively known as the Golconda diamonds, which also include the Koh-i-Noor and the Hope Diamond. The Beau Sancy is sometimes also known as the 'Little Sancy' to better distinguish it from its larger sibling. It is unknown when the diamond first reached Europe, but the earliest record of its existence comes when it was acquired by French diplomat Nicolas de Harlay, seigneur de Sancy, most likely in Constantinople, where he was the French ambassador at the court of Sultan Selim II. When de Sancy faced financial difficulties in attempting to raise an army for Henry III of France, he was forced to sell off some of his jewels, among them both Sancy diamonds; the stones received their names after this sale in around 1589. Coronation portrait of Marie de' Medici (1610) At the same time, Marie de' Medici had been looking to acquire the largest diamonds she could find on the market. Besides being the heiress to the House of Medici and recipient of a massive fortune, Marie had also inherited a love of diamonds from her father, Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. When de Sancy put his jewels up for sale, Marie saw her chance to buy the 55-carat Sancy, at the time the largest diamond that had ever reached the European market. However, she was outbid by King James VI and I, who used the Sancy in creating the Mirror of Great Britain. Not to be outdone, Marie hastened to acquire the 35-carat Beau Sancy instead, which was nominally gifted to her by her husband Henry IV of France in 1604. Marie had the stone set into the very top of a crown of pearls and diamonds for her coronation in the Basilica of Saint-Denis in 1610. The Beau Sancy is clearly visible in her Coronation Portrait by Frans Pourbus the Younger. When Henry was assassinated shortly afterward, Marie became regent for her nine year old son Louis XIII, who then exiled her in 1617 due to her mismanagement and ceaseless political intrigues. Marie fled France in 1630, and would remain in exile in Cologne until her death in 1642. Despite her debts piling up, Marie managed to hold on to the Beau Sancy, but the stone eventually had to be sold to pay for her funeral and assorted other expenses.alt=The buyer was Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, who acquired the diamond from an Amsterdam gem dealer for the sum of 80,000 florins. While this was undoubtedly a significant expense, court jeweller Thomas Cletcher assessed the stone's value at over 150,000 guilders, making the purchase a bargain. Frederick Henry intended the Beau Sancy as a gift for his new daughter-in-law, the 10-year-old Mary, Princess Royal, daughter of Charles I of England, who also happened to be the granddaughter of Marie de' Medici. The stone would remain with the House of Orange for the next years, but Mary pawned the Beau Sancy in 1659 to support her brother Charles II in his quest to regain the English crown for the House of Stuart. The Restoration being successful, Mary joined her brother in London, where she died in 1661 without having been able to redeem the Beau Sancy, or return her other jewellery from England. This task fell to her mother Amalia of Solms- Braunfels, who was able to solve the problem by arranging for her grandson William III to marry James' II daughter Mary, with the pair being crowned joint monarchs of England in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Beau Sancy thus became part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom for the duration of William and Mary's reign. Mary predeceased William in 1694, and when the King died in 1702, the diamond passed back to the House of Orange, since the couple had been childless. As the highest-ranking member of the House, Frederick I of Prussia claimed the jewel in 1702. Eager to emulate other absolutist monarchs after his self-elevation to the title of King in Prussia just one year earlier, Frederick considered the storied Beau Sancy to be the cornerstone of the Prussian Crown Jewels. Set in the center of a new crown, and worth a reputed 300,000 Reichsthaler, the diamond spoke to the self-made king's aspirations. In 1713, the jewel passed from Frederick to his son, the 'soldier king' Frederick William I, who in turn passed it to Frederick the Great in 1740. Frederick the Great famously abhored all signifiers of stylishness, and gave the stone to his wife Elisabeth Christine, who had the Beau Sancy reset in 1739 in the Rococo style as a bouquet jewel. A painting of Elisabeth Christine by Antoine Pesne shows the diamond as the centerpiece of an elaborate pink bowtie. Empress Augusta Viktoria with the Beau Sancy as a breast ornament, 1913 The jewel remained in the possession of Prussia's ruling House of Hohenzollern for the next 179 years, surviving the 1806 invasion of Napoleon and seeing the rise of the Kings of Prussia to become German Emperors. The Beau Sancy retained its exalted position amongst the crown jewels, but was reset several times as a pendant, which it was customary for the bride to wear at royal weddings. The last Empress to wear the diamond was Augusta Victoria, wife of Wilhelm II. The last Kaiser abdicated the throne at the end of the First World War in 1918 and went into exile in the Netherlands, but the stone remained in Berlin. At the end of Second World War, it was transferred to a bricked-up crypt for safe-keeping, where it was found by British troops and returned to the estate of the House of Prussia. In the decades following the war, the Beau Sancy was occasionally exhibited publicy. In 1972 it was shown in Helsinki together with its sibling diamond the Sancy, at which point the two diamonds had been separated for 370 years. The jewel's story with the House of Hohenzollern ends in 2012, when it was put up for auction with Sotheby's by Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia. Although the pre-sale estimate had only been between $2‚Äì4 million, an eight-minute battle between five interested parties ensued, with the final bid of $9.7 million coming from an anonymous buyer. The Beau Sancy has not been publicly exhibited since. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Balfour, Ian (2009). Famous Diamonds 5th ed.

She is a reproduction of the 1779 Hermione, which achieved fame by ferrying General La Fayette to the United States in 1780 to allow him to rejoin the American side in the American Revolutionary War. == Construction == This project was conceived by members of the Centre International de la Mer in 1992, and construction began in 1997, envisaging a launch in April 2015 (as compared to the original, which took less than a year to build). The shipyard was in one of the two dry docks beside the Corderie Royale at Rochefort. As far as possible, traditional construction methods were used although modern power tools were substituted for the period tools on some jobs. The site is open to the public, and admission fees help fund the project. English plans of a sister ship, , were used. The cost was estimated to be $22 million. The original plans had been modified in several ways for reasons of strength and safety: planks had been bolted rather than pegged to avoid movement during the long period of construction. Similarly, the mast sections were fastened with glue rather than metal hoops to avoid water penetration. The cannons are lightweight and non-functional to save weight. Manilla rope has been used for the majority of the rigging and the sails made of linen canvas. An engine will be used for safety, and electric generators for lighting and basic amenities. ==2015 voyage== In preparation for a transatlantic voyage in 2015, the frigate departed from Rochefort and started her seaworthiness trials on 7 September 2014.

The party was elected into the Riigikogu the following year with 7.1% of the nationwide vote, which granted them six seats. In 2010, amid growing tensions following their failed runs in the European Parliament and local elections in 2009, Tammet along with 19 other members was thrown out of the party. It subsequently failed to reach the minimum 5% of the vote needed in the 2011 parliamentary elections and faded. Tammet is a professor at the Tallinn University of Technology and is the faculty manager of its computer science institute. Previously he had helped found the Tallinn IT College and was on its board of advisors from its inception in 2003. Tammet has also worked in the Institute of Cybernetics in Tallinn.

Shri Viswanathan, however, resigned from the State Assembly in 1950 along with his other colleagues in response to a call from the Cochin Praja Mandal to that effect. He then turned his attention to welfare activities among the masses and soon came to be known as a leading social worker as also an astute Congressman in and around the Cochin region. In 1957, when the EMS-led Communist Ministry was installed in office after the first general elections, after the formation of Kerala State in November 1956, Shri Viswanathan was also a Member of the Assembly and was eventually elected as Secretary of the Kerala Congress Legislative Party. He dedicated himself to the cause of the weaker sections with missionary zeal and ardently advocated several progressive measures and legislations for the amelioration of their condition. By then he had become one amongst front-ranking Parliamentarians in Kerala and gained recognition even of members of Opposition parties as an expert in land reforms. During this period he decided to give be up even his lucrative law practice in order to be able to devote his full-time and care to the party work. Shri Viswanathan was returned to the State Assembly with a huge margin of votes when fresh elections were held in 1959 after the exit of the Communist Ministry headed by Shri E.M.S. Namboodiripad as a result of the liberation struggle launched by the people against it. He lent his powerful support and guidance first to the Coalition Government and later to the Congress Ministry in bringing about various land reform measures in the State. Shri Vishwanathan edited a Malayalam Weekly named The Republic and ably projected Congress policies and programmes which gained acceptance and support from the common people. He was the Secretary of the State Congress Legislative Party during 1957-60 and 1960‚Äì64 and the General Secretary of the KPCC from 1966 to 1969. The first ever AICC session held in Kerala was successfully organized by him in Ernakulam in 1966. After the split in Congress ranks in 1969, he, as the Convener of the ad hoc KPCC, was responsible in establishing the Congress Party on strong foundations. He was later elected as President of the KPCC in 1970, followed by his re-election to the same post in December, 1972. In addition to his Parliamentary work, Shri Viswanathan was Chairman of the State Evaluation Committee of Programmes for the Scheduled Casters and the Scheduled Tribes during the first and the Second Five Year Plans; was a member on the Kerala State Food Advisory Committee, the Public Health Advisory Committee, the High Power Committee on Land Reforms, the Estimates Committee, the Assurance Committee and the Rules Committee. He organized an All India exhibition during the Centenary of Sree Narayana Guru in 1956. As President of various important Trade Unions, he actively participated in several labor welfare programmes for nearly two decades. Besides, he played a prominent role in the adult franchise movement as a pre-condition to the induction of Responsible Government in the Cochin State. During his tenure in the Congress, Shri Viswanathan took a very keen interest in reorganizing the KPCC and secured far better representation on it for the Harijans, minority communities and the youth which enhanced the party's involvement in the lives of all categories of people in the State, lending it a greater democratic touch. He also helped opening of hotels and restaurants managed by the Harijans. He played a notable role in raising and developing the Congress Seva Dal into a 25,000 strong trained volunteer organization. During his long and eventful public life in Kerala, Shri Viswanathan could see through many an ambitious and progressive reform in political as well as social spheres. He was able to elicit all round admiration and respect for his intellectual honesty and wisdom even from his seniors. He came to be considered a friend, philosopher and guide by his junior colleagues. Even amongst opposition party members there was great appreciation of his transparent sincerity and he was held in high esteem and affection for his qualities of head and heart. He took over as the Governor of Gujarat on April 4, 1973, and continued to serve Gujarat till August 13, 1978. He later served as the president of SNDP Yogam. He continued in office till his death on August 17, 1992, aged 78. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Members of the Kerala Legislative Assembly ","title":"K. K.

The English translation is by Philip Boehm (2012). ==Summary== It is a depiction of the persecution of ethnic Germans in Romania by the Stalinist regime of the Soviet Union, and deals with the deportation of Romanian Germans to the Soviet Union for forced labour by Soviet occupying forces during and after 1945. The novel tells the story of a youth from Sibiu in Transylvania, Leo Auberg, who is deported at the age of 17 to a Soviet forced labor concentration camp in Nowo- Gorlowka (Novogorlovka, Ukraine, now incorporated in Gorlovka) and spends five years of his life there. It is inspired by the experiences of poet Oskar Pastior and other survivors, including the mother of the author.\\"Atemschaukel\\" ‚Äì Roman aus dem Versunkenland, tagesspiegel.de Initially, Pastior and M√ºller had planned to write a book about his experiences together, however, Pastior died in 2006.http://www.focus.de/kultur/buecher/literaturnobelpreis-der- vorwurf-ist-absurd_aid_443317.html It is based on her interviews with many deportees from her home village of Ni»õchidorf in Romania; from fragments offered during her childhood by her mother; and extensively from her interactions with the poet Oskar Pastior who was a deportee from Sibiu (Hermannstadt) Romania for five years. Reading \\"Atemschaukel\\", Potsdam, Juli 2010 The title comes from a compound word \\"Hungerengel\\" coined by Pastior to describe the pervasive hunger that dominated his prison experience in the Donets Basin as war reparations slave labor. The fierce hunger was also an angel that kept him alive during the ordeal. The German title, Atemschaukel, is another compound word that is more difficult to translate, meaning something like \\"BreathingSwing\\" or \\"BreathSwinging\\", to denote the mechanical and distanced aspects of self-awareness of breathing that the prison experience engendered. According to Ruth Klueger this book offers a new direction in German literature, that of fiction by a second hand participant in the camps, whether Gulag or Internment or Concentration or Extermination. ==Translation== Translation rights have been sold in several countries including Poland and Sweden.Everything I Possess I Carry With Me, (New books in German). The working title of \\"Everything I Possess I Carry With Me\\", based on the first sentence of the book, was suggested by the German publisher when it sold translation rights, however no English-language translation was published under this title. ==Awards and honors== The novel was nominated for the prestigious German Book Prize in 2009, and the author received the Nobel Prize in Literature the same year. The English translation by Philip Boehm was nominated for the Best Translated Book Award (2013), and won the Oxford- Weidenfeld Translation Prize (2013). ==Editions== *The Hunger Angel, Philip Boehm (Translator), Metropolitan Books, April 24, 2012, ==References * \\"Half-lives in the shadow of starvation\\".

The woodlands of the lower Wye Valley are one of the most important areas for woodland conservation in the United Kingdom. This is an area of semi-natural woodland which is continuous along the gorge sides. The woods are a mixture of stand types which are considered to be similar to the original natural woods of the valley. Rare and local species are present. There are two units of assessment. Unit 1 is a site and includes Ban-y-gor Wood nature reserve. Unit 2 is a site and includes Lancaut nature reserve. Wintour's Leap is part of the Lancaut nature reserve.Natural England SSSI information on the Lower Wye Gorge units ==Lancaut reserve== A view north of the River Wye, Lancaut Below Wintour's Leap, Lancaut Lancaut reserve () is a site and lies on the east bank of the Wye Gorge, north of Chepstow. The gorge is formed from massive Lower Carboniferous limestones and sandstones and rises 250 ft above the tidal River Wye. The reserve is made up of Lancaut Wood, Pen Moel and Chapelhouse Woods, disused quarries, limestone cliffs, and saltmarsh. It is one of the few sites in the United Kingdom showing the natural transition from saltmarsh to valley woodland. It became a Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust reserve in 1971. There is a public footpath which runs through the woods from the ruins of Lancaut Chapel to below Pen Moel, which returns by Offa's Dyke Path.Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al, 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' ===Trees=== The steep slopes and historic quarrying of limestone for agriculture and construction, such as the Avonmouth Docks, have resulted in a diverse woodland. Trees include pedunculate oak, ash, field maple, yew, small-leaved lime, wild service-tree, wayfaring tree and rare whitebeams. ===Ground flora=== The ground flora includes ferns and a spring display of primrose, bluebell, dog-violet, wood anemone and early purple orchid. Also recorded are green hellebore, bird's nest orchid and fingered sedge. Wild flowers grow on the open rock faces, cliff ledges and in the quarries. These include hairy violet, yellow-wort, lesser calamint, oxeye daisy, red valerian and shining crane's-bill. The flora of the saltmarsh includes sea aster, English scurvy-grass, sea milkwort and buck's-horn plantain. There are a variety of lichens and mosses.2011, 'Nature Reserve Guide', Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust published to celebrate its 50th anniversary ===Birds and mammals=== Lancaut's cliffs, which are south-facing, are regular nesting sites for peregrine falcons and ravens. Sparrowhawk, goshawk, kestrel, cormorant, heron, shelduck, wood warbler, lapwing and goldcrest are amongst the wide range of birds recorded. \` ===Conservation=== Invasive Sycamore is controlled and scrub removed from limestone scree areas to promote a grassland flora. Erosion of the saltmarsh from natural and artificial causes is considered a major problem. ==Ban-y-gor Wood== Ban-y-gor Wood () is a site and faces north and is, therefore, a much darker, cooler and wetter wood than Lancaut. The wood was donated to the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust in 1995 by the Clay Estate, and part of Lancaut was given at the same time. The wood descends about a 100 metres down to the River Wye edge. The slopes are very steep and there are areas of cliff exposures, bare sandstone, and limestone rocks. Although steep and potentially inaccessible, there is evidence of quarrying in the past. There is derelict winding gear present which was used to pump water up from the river. This is an area of secluded habitat, carpeted with ferns and mosses, with large ancient coppice and pollards. A single path descends via a small glade towards the river. ===Trees=== The tree canopy includes beech (some huge old coppice stools), ash, sessile oak, silver birch, common whitebeam and small-leaved lime. Yew is the dominant shrub, particularly beneath beech trees. There is hazel coppice, field maple, hawthorn, holly and goat willow. There is a rare hybrid present between rowan and whitebeam. ===Ground flora=== The conditions are damp and acidic and the ground flora includes foxglove, woodruff, tutsan, slender St John's-wort, wild madder, great woodrush, wood sage, bilberry, wood sorrel. The many ferns include hard shield fern, hard fern, scaly male-fern and maidenhair spleenwort. The general woodland flowers include bluebell, wood anemone, primrose, dog-violet and yellow archangel. There are many mosses and liverworts present. ===Mammals=== Dormice are recorded within the woodland. ===Conservation=== Structural variety is increased by cutting glades and small coppice coupes particularly either side of the path. ==Publications== * Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al., 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' * 'Lancaut and Ban-y-Gor Nature Reserves ‚Äì Information and the Lancaut Walk', (undated), Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust * 'Where to see Wildlife in the Forest of Dean', January 2012, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust ==See also== *Upper Wye Gorge *Wye Valley AONB ==ReferencesSSSI Source== * Natural England SSSI information on the citation * Natural England SSSI information on the Lower Wye Gorge units ==External links== * Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust * Natural England (SSSI information) Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1954 Category:Nature reserves in Gloucestershire Category:Forests and woodlands of Gloucestershire Category:River Wye ","title":"Lower Wye Gorge SSSI"},{"id":"35839596","text":"Heteropsis laetifica is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Written by Paul Franklin, the film is about the foreman at a ranch owned by a wealthy rodeo owner who will lose her rodeo contract unless sales improve. ==Plot== The owner of the Silver Shadow ranch, Maureen McClune (Peggy Moran), runs the Frontier Week rodeo every year, relying on the financial success of the event to support the ranch. The current rodeo is the most profitable in the event's history, but Maureen is told by the rodeo organizers that she must do even better if she hopes to get her contract renewed. Maureen's main competition is Jack Pomeroy (LeRoy Mason), who owns a rival ranch and a local nightclub and gambling house. Following a series of \\"accidents\\" apparently caused by negligence during the rodeo, Maureen's foreman, Gene Autry (Gene Autry), sets out to prove that Pomeroy is responsible. Maureen's Aunt Hattie (Pert Kelton) wins some money at a roulette table at Pomeroy's club, thanks to Gene's disabling of the rigged mechanisms. Returning home, they are ambushed by Pomeroy's men. Later, Gene breaks into Pomeroy's office to get additional proof of his guilt. On the last day of the Frontier Week rodeo, Gene rides against one of Pomeroy's men in the final event, a stagecoach race. Aunt Hattie bets everything she has on Gene, hoping to save the ranch. When Gene discovers his friend, Frog Milhouse (Smiley Burnette), making a recording of a proposal to Hattie, he realizes that Frog's recorder could entrap Pomeroy. He instructs Frog to place the device below Pomeroy's seats at the rodeo just before the start of the race. Pomeroy persuades the sheriff that Gene has committed a murder, but Gene is able to escape. With Frog's help, Gene is able to make it to the race on time. While Gene rides furiously, nearly losing his life, Frog records Pomeroy and his men discussing the \\"accidents\\" they created during the rodeo. Gene ends up winning the race, Hattie wins her bet, and Pomeroy and his henchmen are arrested. With their financial worries behind them, Gene and Maureen are free to marry, as are Frog and Hattie. ==Cast== * Gene Autry as Gene Autry * Smiley Burnette as Frog Milhouse * Pert Kelton as Aunt Hattie * Peggy Moran as Maurine McClune * LeRoy Mason as Jack Pomeroy * Arthur Loft as Cylde Chase * Ethan Laidlaw as Tex Robinson * Walter De Palma as Leach, the tall henchman * Arch Hall Sr. as Rusty, the henchman in the stage * Eddie Hart as Alex, the henchman * Eddie Acuff as Dixie Erwin * Champion as Gene's Horse (uncredited)Magers, p. 121. ==ProductionStuntwork=== * Ken Cooper (Gene's double) * Jack Kirk (Smiley's double) * Bill Yrigoyen * Joe Yrigoyen ===Filming locations=== * Corriganville Movie Ranch, Simi Valley, California, USA * Iverson Ranch, 1 Iverson Lane, Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California, USA ===Soundtrack=== * \\"Merry Go Roundup\\" (Gene Autry, Johnny Marvin, Fred Rose) by Gene Autry (vocal and guitar) * \\"She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain\\" (Traditional) by Smiley Burnette (a cappella vocal) * \\"Oh!

FNF also advocates for shared parenting, more time for children with their non-custodial parent, and stronger court actions when a custodial parent defies court orders requiring them to allow their children a relationship with the other parent. The organisation's goal is that children of divorce or separation should not lose the love and care of one of their parents.Families Need Fathers, About Us __TOC__ == Mission == In the United Kingdom, roughly one third of children from separated parents have no contact with their father, and the organization is chiefly concerned with maintaining a child's relationship with both parents during and after family breakdown. The majority of the work of the charity is in providing relief, assistance, guidance and support to parents and other close family members hoping to stay in touch with their children after divorce or separation. It aims to further the emotional development of children whose parents have separated by encouraging shared parenting arrangements which enable such children to have continuing and meaningful relationships with both parents. The organization also seek to study problems associated with children who are deprived of a parent, and to promote an understanding of these problems among family and legal professionals and policy makers. == Parental support work== In 2016, Families Need Fathers received around 25,000 calls to its Helpline, around 5,000 visitors to local meetings, a similar number of posts to its online Forum, and 185,000 unique page views to its website. ==Shared parenting advocacy== The organization advocates for shared parenting, whereby the children live substantial amounts of time with both of their divorced or separated parents. They base their advocacy on scientific studies showing that shared parenting is in the best interest of children, citing research by Malin Bergstr√∂m, Robert Bauserman, Richard Layard, Judith Dunn, Rebekah Levine Coley and Bethany L. Medeiros, among others.Families Need Fathers, What is Shared Parenting?Families Need Fathers, Shared Parenting Research == History and Organization == Families Need Fathers was founded in May 1974 by child psychiatrist Alick Elithorn and financial consultant Keith Parkin as an organization to campaign for equal parenting time after divorce, and for increased contact between a child and its non-custodial parent. The organization became a registered charity in 1979, and was able to hire staff in 1992. As the organization grew and started to receive government funding, some members left in the 1990s and several new organizations was founded such as Parents Forever Scotland, the Association of Shared Parenting, Dads After Divorce, and Fathers4Justice. In 1994, the Cheltenham Group was formed by FNF, Dads After Divorce and Parents Forever Scotland in an attempt to form a coalition of parenting organizations.Keith Parkin, Fathers need their families, The Guardian, June 12, 1974.ExInjuria - Moving beyond injustice, An Exercise in Absolute Futility, February 9, 2014.Barry Worrall, Without authority, The Cheltenham Group, 2004. In 2008, FNF ran projects under the umbrella of \\"Both Parents Matter\\" and this strapline was added to the charity's logo in 2013 to clearly articulate the emphasis the charity placed on the importance of both parents in a child's life. By 2010, the organization had 51 branches across the United Kingdom and a network of 300 volunteers. It has since continued to advocate for shared parenting with the media, the House of Commons and the family justice establishment, while continuing its work as a social care organization. Jon Davies was the chief executive from 2006 to 2010. The current chair is Jerry Karlin, and Michael Lewkowicz is the company secretary.Families Need Fathers, National Council == Criticism == In 1994, Labour Party MP Glenda Jackson claimed that Families Need Fathers advised fathers to kidnap their children if they were not allowed access to them, and if that did not work, to murder the mother.House of Commons, Parliamentary Business, July 4, 1994, 7:50pm. In a subsequent letter regarding the organizations draft mission statement, she reiterated the kidnapping assertion and found the mission statement to be an attack on women rather than an argument for keeping children and parents in contact. In neither instance did the MP provide a source for the kidnapping claim. In 2007, journalist Jenni Murray argued that at its foundation, FNF cast itself outside the frame of respectability as they were said to advocate for the abduction of children whose custody was awarded to the mother. More recently in 2017, Legal Action for Women protested at an FNF conference. They cited Jackson's 1994 kidnapping comment in parliament and protested that the organization has consistently attacked women and that they deny the existence of domestic violence.Legal Action for Women, 24 October 2017. == FNF-BPM Cymru == Families Need Fathers Both Parents Matter Cymru (FNFBPM Cymru) is a separately registered charity that was set up to respond to changes affecting parents going through separation that may result from Welsh devolution. For example, Wales has (CAFCASS) Cymru, while England has (CAFCASS). The National Manager of the charity is Paul Apreda who amongst other things coordinates support meetings across Wales and seeks to develop the infrastructure of the charity to provide assistance to increasing numbers of people. In 2011 FNFBPM Cymru ran a competition in South Wales looking for a \\"superdad\\", with a ¬£500 prize for the winner. It was followed the next year by the \\"Inspirational Wales Dad of the Year Award\\" at Ty Hywel in Cardiff Bay. In 2013 the Charity held a Dinner to celebrate fathers with Louis de Bernieres as the guest speaker. In the last year, the Charity has hosted lectures on Parental Alienation with Karen Woodall one of the world experts in the subject in Cardiff and in Llandudno Junction for professionals working in the family law arena to attend. Following funding from Cardiff City Council the charity has produced a booklet \\"A guide for school professionals... working with fathers and other non resident parents\\" There are support groups that meet once a month in Cardiff, Aberystwyth, Bangor, Blackwood, Bridgend, Merthyr, Newport, Swansea and Wrexham. A new group is due to start in St Clares this year. In Cardiff there is also a once monthly emotional support group led by a professional counselor. It also provides a telephone helpline and emotional support for parents and other family members dealing with issues relating to separation from their children. Support meetings include a wide range of people - not just fathers. Increasingly (and thought by some as a result to the changes in Legal Aid eligibility) volunteers are supporting grandparents and mothers (both resident and non resident) who are seeking assistance in dealing with emotional and legal support. ==See also== *Shared parenting *Parental alienation *Shared residency in England *Fathers' rights movement in the UK *English family law *Family court ==References *Families Need Fathers Homepage *FNFBPM Cymru Homepage Category:1974 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Charities based in London Category:Charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Children's rights Category:Family and parenting issues groups in the United Kingdom Category:Fathers' rights Category:Fathers' rights organizations Category:Organizations established in 1974 Category:Support groups ","title":"Families Need Fathers"},{"id":"35839840","text":"Frank George Covelli (born 2 April 1937 in Paducah, Kentucky) is an American former javelin thrower who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics and in the 1968 Summer Olympics.

It has been found that many epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the regulation and expression of genes such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. These epigenetic mechanisms are believed to be a contributing factor to pathological diseases such as type 2 diabetes. An understanding of the epigenome of Diabetes patients may help to elucidate otherwise hidden causes of this disease. == PPARGC1A candidate gene == The PPARGC1A gene regulates genes involved in energy metabolism. Since Type 2 diabetes is characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia as a result of impaired pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, it was thought that the gene might be downregulated in type 2 diabetes patients through DNA methylation. The defects in pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues were thought to be the result of impaired ATP production from reduced oxidative phosphorylation. It was found that the mRNA expression of PPARGC1A was markedly reduced in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic donors compared with that of non-diabetic donors. Using bisulfite testing, it was also found that there was an approximately twofold increase in DNA methylation of the PPARGC1A promoter of human islet cells from diabetics as compared to non-diabetic human islet cells. This means that expression from the PPARGC1A genes were turned down in the diabetic patients. Further testing revealed that the more PPARGC1A was expressed, the more insulin was released from the islets, and as expected, in diabetic patients there was less PPARGC1A expressed and also less insulin secreted. This data supports the idea that PPARGC1A expression is reduced in animal models of diabetes and human diabetes and is associated with impaired insulin secretion. PGC-1Œ± can modulate glucose-mediated insulin secretion in human islets, most likely through an effect on ATP production. In human type 2 diabetic islets, reduced PPARGC1A mRNA levels were associated with impaired glucose-mediated insulin secretion. It was suggested that DNA methylation was the mechanism through which the PPARGC1A gene was turned down. In a different study where transcriptional changes due to a risk factors for diabetes, were examined, changes in the methylation patterns of the PPARGC1A gene were also found. In the study done on physical inactivity, where subjects were required to have a sustained bed-rest of 10 days and were then examined, it was also found that there was significant downregulation of the PPARGC1A gene. In addition, it was shown that after the bed rest, there was a marked increase in DNA methylation of the PPARGC1A gene along with a decrease in mRNA expression. Another risk factor is low birth weight (LBW), and in a study done on that, it was found that there was increased DNA methylation in the LBW patients' muscle cells. == Micro-RNA in the regulation of glucose== Micro RNAs (miRNA) are single- stranded transcribed RNAs of 19‚Äì25 nucleotides in length that are generated from endogenous hairpin structured transcripts throughout the genome. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs have pivotal roles in many different gene regulatory pathways. A subset of miRNAs has been shown to be involved in metabolic regulation of glucose homeostasis and in epigenetics of diabetes type 2. Pancreatic islet-specific miR-375 inhibits insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic Œ≤-cells by inhibiting the expression of the protein myotrophin. An overexpression of miR-375 can completely suppress glucose-induced insulin secretion, while inhibition of native miR-375 will increase insulin secretion. In another study, increasing the level of miR-9, a different miRNA, resulted in a severe defect in glucose-stimulated insulin release. This happens because miR-9 down-regulated the transcription factor Onecut2 (OC2) that controls the expression of RAB27A effector granuphilin, a key factor in controlling insulin release. Also miR-192 levels have been shown to be increased in glomeruli isolated from diabetic mice when compared to non-diabetic mice, suggesting that it is involved as well. Since miR-192 was shown to regulate extracellular matrix proteins Collagen, type I, alpha 1 and Œ±2 (Col1Œ±1 and 2) that accumulate during diabetic nephropathy, miR-192 may play a role in kidney diseases as well. A correlation between elevated Notch signaling pathway gene expression, which is important for cell to cell communication, and diabetic nephropathy has also been shown. MiR-143 has also been experimentally shown to regulate genes that are crucial for adipocyte differentiation, (including GLUT4, Hormone-sensitive lipase, the fatty acid-binding protein, aP2 and PPAR-Œ≥2), demonstrating that miRNAs are also involved in fat metabolism and endocrine function in humans. == Vascular complications == Epigenetics may play a role in a wide array of vascular complications and in diabetes. The epigenetic variations involved with diabetes can change chromatin structure as well as gene expression. Regardless of whether glycemic control has been achieved through treatment these epigenetic mechanisms are lasting and do not change with the alteration of diet. The most common vascular complication in patients with Type 2 Diabetes is retinopathy which causes many patients to go blind. Studies showed that retinal damage persisted even after the reversal of hyperglycemia in dogs. Studies with streptozotocin injected Type 1 diabetes rats showed that the re-institution of glycemic control after a short period of hyperglycemia had protective effects in the eyes, including reduction in parameters of oxidant stress and inflammation. However, specimens with prolonged diabetes failed to show similar protection. It was then seen with endothelial cells (which line blood vessels) cultured in high glucose that there was a sustained increase in the expression of key extracellular and pro- fibrotic genes and persistently increased oxidant stress, after subsequent glucose normalization. These studies show that the deleterious effects of prior hyperglycemic exposure have long-lasting effects on target organs even after subsequent glycaemic control underscoring the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control in diabetes. The persistence of these symptoms points to epigenesis as an underlying cause. Studies have shown that the islet dysfunction and development of diabetes in rats is associated with epigenetic silencing via DNA methylation of the gene Pdx1 promoter, which produces a key transcription factor that regulates beta-cell differentiation and insulin gene expression. Silencing at this promoter decreases the amount of beta-cells produced which leads to insulin resistance and the inability of the beta-cells to produce an important peptide that prevents vascular deterioration and neuropathy caused from vascular inflammatory responses. A subsequent study shows that under high glucose conditions, islet-specific transcription factor Pdx1 was shown to stimulate insulin expression by recruiting co-activators p300 and the Histone methyl transferase SETD7/9, which increased histone acetylation and H3K4me2, respectively, and the formation of open chromatin at the insulin promoter. In contrast, under low-glucose conditions, Pdx1 could recruit co-repressors HDAC1/2, which led to inhibition of insulin gene expression. Furthermore, Pdx1 also mediated Œ≤-cell-specific expression of SET7/9, which may regulate genes involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion. Nephropathy is another common symptom of diabetes patients and is caused by angiopathy of the capillaries in the kidneys. A gene known as UNC13B shows hypermethylation in diabetes patients genomes and is linked to diabetic nephropathy. The National Center for Biotechnology Information claims that hyperglycemia leads to an upregulation of this gene due to the increase in methylation at important CpG sites within the gene. UNC13B produces a protein with a diacylglycerol (DAG) binding domain. Hyperglycemia increases DAG levels in the blood which causes apoptosis in cells upregulating this gene and renal complications when DAG binds to the product of the UNC13B gene. The production of fat hinders the ability for muscles and other cells in the body to respond properly to glucose and insulin, furthering the complications involved with diabetes. Increased levels of fat in the body and blood raises blood pressure, increases cholesterol, and causes arteriosclerosis; all of which are severely dangerous vascular complications for patients suffering from diabetes and can lead to death. The epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and the Polycomb group of proteins such as Bmi-1, the H3K27me3 transferase Ezh2, its demethylase JMJD3, and the H3K4me3 transferase MLL were shown to be regulators in the expression of tumour suppressor p16INK4a in Œ≤-cell proliferation and regeneration. Post-translational modifications of histones (H3K4me2 and H3K9me2), H3K4 demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), and an H3K9me2 methyltransferase SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) were also implicated in diabetes related adipogenesis. The inflammatory response arises from vascular tissues and specialized white blood cells, and a persistent state of inflammation under diabetic stress leads to clots and vascular deterioration. Patients suffer edema, aneurysms, and injuries that cannot heal properly because the vascular system is unable to respond properly when under epigenetic influences. Diabetes and the associated hyperglycemia can lead to production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and growth factors. Together, they activate multiple signal transduction pathways including oxidant stress, tyrosine kinases, PKC, and MAPKs leading to activation of transcription factors such as NF-Œ∫B, and dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms including HKme, histone lysine acetylation, and DNA methylation via the action of corresponding methyltransferases, demethylases, acetylases, and deacetylases. This leads to higher accessibility of pathological gene expression products and activation of pathological genes. Being in this state of diabetic stress leads to long term metabolic memory and altered epigenome with adverse side effects on the cardiovascular system. Oxidized Low-density lipoprotein-induced chemokine expression was associated with H3KAc and phosphorylation, and recruitment of HATs along with NF-Œ∫B in endothelial cells, and these were reversed by pre-treatment with statins. Studies show alterations in histone modification patterns, along with changes in expression of the corresponding Histone methyltransferases, in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells from aortas of adult mice exposed to hypercholesterolaemia. Studies in monocytes, white blood cells that travel along vascular surfaces, showed that H3K9/14Ac and HATs CBP/p300, H3R17me and its methyltransferase CARM1, play key roles in inflammatory gene expression. HDACs also played key roles in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory gene expression in monocytes and macrophages. Prolonged inflammatory responses in the cardiovascular system lead to atherosclerosis and high blood pressure which contribute to the many heart attacks and strokes caused by diabetes each year. In humans it has been shown that inflammatory gene expression induced by diabetic stimuli like high glucose and a RAGE ligand S100B was associated with increased H3K9/14Ac genome wide along with increased recruitment of NF-Œ∫B and HATs CBP/p300 at inflammatory gene promoters in THP1 cell line monocytes. In vivo, increased histone lysine acetylation at these promoters in monocytes obtained from Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Diabetes type 2 patients was seen. Acetylation at these promoters increases gene expression and increases the inflammatory response as a result. Genome-wide location studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with DNA microarray analysis revealed significant changes in H3K4me2 and H3K9me2 patterns at key gene regions in high glucose-treated THP-1 monocytes, with relevant changes being observed in primary monocytes from diabetes patients. A possible treatment for vascular complications of diabetes exists with the SIRT1 gene, a member of Sirtuin family of genes. The SIRT1 enzyme has HDAC activity, and has been shown to modulate energy metabolism and inflammation. SIRT1 overexpression or activation by resveratrol could improve insulin resistance and SIRT1 activators are being developed for diabetes treatment. The role of other HDACs and the potential use of HDAC inhibitors in diabetes is not very clear. Other treatments look towards an anti-inflammatory agent and HAT inhibitor, curcumin, which in trials ameliorated high glucose-induced inflammatory gene expression and histone acetylation at their promoters as well as changes in HAT and HDAC activities in human monocytes. == Metabolic memory == Metabolic memory is the phenomenon of diabetic vascular stresses persisting after glucose normalization in diabetic patients because of early an glycemic environment. Hyperglycemia appears to be remembered in organs such as the kidney, eyes, and heart. Evidence of this is found in patients who were always in intensive therapy when they are compared to patients who began in conventional therapy and then switched to intensive therapy. The first group had delayed progression of nephropathy, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy. Metabolic memory may be regulated by epigenetics. Recent studies have shown that diabetic patients have decreased H3K9me3 and an increase in the Histone methyltransferase called SUV39H1, and all of these changes serve to repress chromatin. Normal patients treated with high glucose exhibited the same changes in DNA methylation, implying that the persistent changes in these marks could be due to the prior hyperglycemia. Oxidant stress may also play an important role in preserving this metabolic memory by modifying or damaging essential lipids, proteins, and/or DNA. == Histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases == Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and HDACs have been found to play key roles in genes linked to diabetes. One example is the SIRT family of HDACs, specifically SIRT1 has been found to regulate several factors involved in metabolism, adipogenesis, and insulin secretion. It has also been seen that histone acetylation promotes some gene expression related to diabetic conditions. This was seen in an experiment when a high glucose treatment of cultured monocytes increased recruitment of the HATs CREB-binding protein (CPB) and PCAF, leading to increased histone lysine acetylation at the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and TNF-inflammatory gene promoters. This led to a corresponding increase in gene expression, which was similar to the increased histone lysine acetylation at these gene promoters in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients compared to healthy control volunteers. == Methylation patterns == There are several factors that put people at higher risk of contracting Type 2 diabetes. Among these are obesity, lack of exercise, and aging. But, not everyone that becomes diabetic falls under these categories. However, what has become clear is that there are multiple loci which increase a person's susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes. One study examined a multitude of papers, creating a detailed list of epigenetic modifications and loci associated with Type 2 diabetes. Prominent among these, was DNA methylation, or lack thereof. After examining Type 2 diabetes patients, it was found that levels of homocysteine were exceptionally high when compared to levels in individuals without the disease. Homocysteine is an intermediate that is responsible for maintaining methylation reactions in critical metabolic processes. It can be re-methylated to form methionine, be taken into the cysteine biosynthetic pathway, or be freed into the extracellular medium. When a person lacks sulfur in their diet, it prompts the body to use methionine and form cysteine. This in turn increases the risk of a person contracting type 2 diabetes later in life. The reason behind this turns out to be rather simple. Methionine directly affects S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) levels. SAM is the substance that provides the methyl groups for DNA methylation. A shortage of SAM leads to an inability to develop proper methylation patterns, and is thought to be an indicator of an increased risk of contracting type 2 diabetes. There are a number of genes involved in chromatin methylation. One of these genes encodes the enzyme Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR is involved in reducing 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This reaction is a critical step in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. The resulting product is a methyl donor that is required for CpG and histone methylation. Mutations in this gene can lead to reduced methylation at CpG sites, and these changes in methylation patterns may increase susceptibility for Type 2 Diabetes. The most common at the gene encoding MTHFR is the C677t mutation. This is not a spontaneous mutation; it is actually hereditary. While the mutation does not inactivate the gene, it greatly reduces the efficiency, thus impairing the formation of methionine. The lack of this amino acid prevents methylation from occurring, and as said above, hypomethylation leads to increased susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes. Type 2 diabetes associated sequence polymorphisms have been identified in 30 linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks across the human genome, but their effects only explain a minor fraction of the observed phenotypic diversity among individuals. Previously, in other studies it has been demonstrated that connections between small methylation differences at isolated CpG sites have large differences in gene-expression levels On a genome wide scale studies have proven that hypomethylation in genes known to be associated with type 2 diabetes has been associated with an increase in susceptibility for the disease. CpG sites in particular display a small but significant case of hypomethylation consistently. The odds of belonging to the Type 2 Diabetes group increased by 6.1% for every 1% decrease in methylation based on microarray-based assay. These observed methylation differences are capable of producing or indicating real expression differences, which lead to the observed enhanced disease risk. Based on this study further investigation proved that if hypomethylation was induced, then the individual was far more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who led a healthy lifestyle. This proven presence of low methylation at certain sites could be used to diagnose diabetes 2 in individuals earlier in future treatment. Studies in 2011 have shown that insulin resistance (IR), the hallmark of type 2 diabetes, may also involve epigenetic control as a contributing factor. Promoter methylation of the mitochondrial transcription factor A gene, an important gene essential for mitochondrial DNA maintenance, was associated with IR in adolescents. A possible link between DNA methylation and insulin resistance was shown through monozygotic twin comparisons and bisulfite pyrosequencing to measure the global DNA methylation of Alu repeats in peripheral blood leukocytes. Alu elements are known to create genomic instability and affect gene expression, and have been implicated in numerous human diseases. Epigenetic alterations arising during the lifetime of monozygotic twins in Alu repeats resulted in an increase in genomic s instability, and consequently cause insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. show that methylation levels at all four CpG sites displayed an increase in Alu methylation. This study provides the first evidence that alteration in global DNA hypermethylation is associated with increased risk of IR independent of established risk factors. Because epigenetic modifications are possibly reversible, this research suggests the potential for lifestyle or therapeutic interventions for insulin resistance. == FTO loci == As shown by various studies, there are a number of genes that affect a person's risk of contracting Type 2 Diabetes. The same applies for obesity, which has several loci in common with the disease. Both are polygenic, but it is possible to identify at least part of the regions via DNA assays. Among these regions is the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, which has shown to increase susceptibility to both obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. When looked at further, it was shown to have increased methylation levels in a haplotype associated with Type 2 Diabetes. To find exactly which portion of the gene led to the higher levels of risk, one group of researchers performed a sliding window analysis. Using the information, they narrowed the search down to the 46 kb linkage disequilibrium block, and within that region found a 7.7 kb region in which methylation levels were abnormally high. Pyrosequencing found that this difference was due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that created CpGs across the haplotype. Within this 7.7 kb, haplotype-specific methylation area, a highly conserved non-coding element (HCNE) was found. Anja Ragvin, a researcher at the University of Bergen, has proven that this HCNE directly effects IRX3 expression. First, HCNE-driven expression patterns were identified via protein imaging. Next, they were compared to IRX3 expression patterns. When compared, it was found that the two patterns matched. Researchers used this information to conclude that the linkage disequilibrium block of the FTO gene acts upon IRX3. These results were also supported by the presence of the H3K4me1 enhancer signature left behind during both HCNE-driven expression and IRX3 expression. In summary, persons at high risk for Type 2 Diabetes and obesity have a highly methylated 7.7 kb region in the linkage disequilibrium block of the FTO gene. This methylation leads to the deactivation of the HCNE located within it, and decreased IRX3 expression. When IRX3 was knocked out, there was a drop in the number of Œ≤-cells that produce insulin and the Œ±-cells that produce glucagon. This sudden drop indicates a direct relationship between the FTO gene, IRX3, and Type 2 diabetes. == References == * Category:Diabetes Category:Epigenetics ","title":"Epigenetics of diabetes Type 2"},{"id":"35839853","text":"Sovereign is an unincorporated community in Logan County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Logan County, West Virginia Category:Coal towns in West Virginia ","title":"Sovereign, West Virginia"},{"id":"35839854","text":"Colson in 1977 Sam Colson (born March 24, 1951 born in Beloit, Kansas) is a former javelin thrower who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics where he finished fifth.

The lament was saved from oblivion by the composer's decision to publish it independently from the opera; in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal, and in 1623 as an accompanied solo. The madrigal version was included in Monteverdi's Sixth Book of Madrigals. It appears in recordings of that collection, and in other madrigal selections. Recordings of the solo version are more plentiful. Most of these employ a female voice, usually either a soprano or mezzo-soprano, but two contralto versions are available. There are also male voice versions for baritone, tenor and countertenor. The year and the label information are generally those of the most recent issue, and do not necessarily relate to the initial recording. ==Five-voice madrigal (1614)== The 5-voice version of Lamento d'Arianna is included in all recordings of Monteverdi's Sixth Book of Madrigals. { !width= \\"50\\"Year of issue !width= \\"250\\"Album title !width =\\"300\\"Performers !width= \\"250\\"Label !width= \\"50\\"Refs - align= \\"center\\" Banchieri:La Pazzia Senile; Monteverdi: Seven Madrigals (selection of seven madrigals from various Books) Sestetto Italiano Luca Marenzio LP: DGG QAPM14132  - align= \\"center\\"1967 Monteverdi: Madrigals (selection of madrigals from various Books) April Cantelo, Eileen Poulter (sopranos), Helen Watts (contralto), Gerald English, Robert Tear (tenors), Christopher Keyte (bass), conductor: Raymond Leppard (harpsichord) LP: HMV HQS1102  - align= \\"center\\"1981 Monteverdi: Madrigals (anthology from 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Books) Marjanne Kweksilber (sop); Ren√© Jacobs (alto); Marius van Altena, Michiel ten Houte de Lange (tenors); Floris Rommart (bass); Gustav Leonherdt (harpsichord) LP: RCA RL30390  - align= \\"center\\"1985 Lamento d'Arianna.

It is a part of the permanent collection at the Flint Institute of Arts. == Description == right The painting is a double portrait of Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria and her son, Ferdinand, the future Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Completed around 1623, after the death of Ferdinand's father, Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, the painting shows Maria Maddalena in the center, with her right hand next to Cosimo II's crown and her left hand resting on her young son's shoulder. Ferdinand would have been thirteen at the time, but looks to be about 4 or 5 years old in the portrait.Justus Sustermans. Flint: Flint Institute of Arts, 2012. Print. In addition, his mother looks much younger in this portrait than in a portrait Sustermans did of her in 1622. It is believed that the first work he completed for the Medici was the 1622 portrait of Cosimo's widow, Marie Madeline, who became Susterman's first patron == Symbolism  Age === Sustermans was known for painting children accurately, so it is unlikely that the artist didn't know how to make Ferdinand look his age. Since this double portrait was delivered with a posthumous portrait of Ferdinand's father, Cosimo II, it is quite possible that this painting is meant to look to the past, just as the posthumous portrait of Cosimo II looked back to the time when he was alive. === Crown === By showing the Grand Duke's crown, Sustermans symbolically included Cosimo II in the portrait of his wife and son. Marie Madeline's right hand is next to the crown, while her left hand rests on her son's shoulder. Standing in between the two, Marie Madeline may be suggesting that she is the link between Ferdinand and the rule of Tuscany. By the time the portrait was completed, Marie Madeline was co-regent of the Grand Duchy, along with her mother-in-law Christina of Lorraine. The co-regency continued until Ferdinand II reached the age of 17. == References  External links == * http://www.flintarts.org Category:Mannerist paintings Category:Paintings in Michigan ","title":"Marie Madeline and Her Son"},{"id":"35839915","text":"Coal Valley is an unincorporated community in Logan County, West Virginia.

He went to live in Ludlow, Shropshire, took an M.D. degree 17 May 1816 at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and was admitted an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians of London 8 June 1816. He commenced physician, and received in 1817 the degree of M.D. from the Archbishop of Canterbury. He became a member of the Royal Irish Academy. On 17 March 1826 Nicoll graduated M.D. at Glasgow University, then moved to London, and was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 26 June 1826. He attained some success in practice, and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 18 February 1830. Around 1834 when Michael Faraday was looking to introduce terminology for electrolysis, he took up suggestions of Nicoll and William Whewell. In 1835 Nicoll gave up practice, and settled at Wimbledon, Surrey, where he died on 3 December 1838. ==Works== Nicoll began to write aon medicine in the London Medical Repository in 1819; his first separate publication, Tentamen Nosologicum had already appeared there, a general classification of diseases based upon their symptoms. The History of the Human ≈íconomy appeared in 1819, and suggests a general physiological method of inquiry in clinical medicine. Primary Elements of Disordered Circulation of the Blood was also published in 1819. General Elements of Pathology‚Äô appeared in 1820, and in 1821 Practical Remarks on the Disordered States of the Cerebral Structures in Infants. This was first read before an association of physicians in Ireland on 6 December 1819; he proposed that erethism of the cranial brain is due to impressions on the anticerebral extremities of nerves, but this theory went beyond his actual observations. He published two ophthalmic‚Äîone of imperfection of vision, the other of colour-blindness‚Äîin the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, vols. vii. and ix. The taste for Hebrew and for theology which he acquired in boyhood from the learned uncle who educated him remained through life. Influenced by his uncle, Nicoll published five theological treatises during his lifetime: * An Analysis of Christianity, London, 1823; ‚Äò * Nug√¶ Hebraic√¶ and Nature the Preacher, 1837; * Remarks on the Breaking and Eating of Bread and Drinking of Wine in Commemoration of the Passion of Christ, London, 1837; * An Inquiry into the Nature and Prospects of the Adamite Race, London, 1838. He left theological works in manuscript, which were published in 1841, with a short sketch of his life. ==Family== Nicoll married: *in 1812, Margaret, daughter of Rev. Robert Rickards, who died 1831; *in 1832, Charlotte, daughter of James Deacon Hume, who died of puerperal fever. ==References== ;Attribution Category:1786 births Category:1838 deaths Category:19th-century English medical doctors Category:Alumni of the University of Aberdeen Category:English theologians Category:Christian Hebraists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society ","title":"Whitlock Nicoll"},{"id":"35840110","text":"The Hills Cricket Club is a cricket club in Skerries, Dublin Ireland, playing in Division 1 of the Leinster Senior League.

Based on the reality singing competition The Voice of Holland, the series was created by Dutch television producer John de Mol. The original coaches for the first three seasons were Lulu Santos, Carlinhos Brown, Claudia Leitte and Daniel. Daniel departed after season three and was replaced by Michel Tel√≥ from season four onwards. Claudia Leitte last coached for season five, then became coach of The Voice Kids, swapping roles with Ivete Sangalo who became coach of the adult version from season six onwards. Carlinhos Brown didn't return for season 8 being replaced by Iza, leaving Lulu Santos as the only coach left from the inaugural season. ==Format== The series is part of The Voice franchise and is based on a similar competition format in The Netherlands entitled The Voice of Holland. The winner is entitled to a R$ 500.000 prize and a recording contract with Universal Music Group. ===Blind auditions=== In The Blind Auditions, the four coaches form their team of artists (12 in seasons 1‚Äì6 and 18 in season 7) whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. Each judge has the length of the auditionee's performance to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same singer then the singer gets to choose which coach they want to work with. Since season 7, a new twist called \\"Block\\" is featured, which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant. ===Battle rounds=== In The Battles, each coach pairs two of his or her team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance. Coaches are given \\"steals\\" (3 in seasons 1‚Äì2 and season 7, 2 in seasons 3‚Äì6), allowing each coach to select individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach. ===Live shows=== In the final phase, the remaining contestants of each team will compete against each other in 4‚Äì7 weeks of live broadcasts. The television audience will help to decide who moves on. When one team member remains for each coach, these four contestants will compete against each other in the finale, with the most voted singer declared the season's winner. Coaches' Battle Introduced in season 5, in the Coaches' Battle, two contestants from two teams battle against each other and the public vote determines who will advance. Remix Introduced in season 5, the Remix round is a way to balance the teams after the Coaches' Battle, which works exactly like the Blind Auditions. ==Coaches and hostsCoaches=== The original coaches were revealed in mid-2012 to be: Brazilian ax√© singer Claudia Leitte, pop rock singer-songwriter Lulu Santos, MPB singer- songwriter Carlinhos Brown and sertanejo singer, Daniel. All four coaches returned for seasons 2 and 3. In 2015, it was announced that Daniel would not return for season 4; sertanejo singer Michel Tel√≥ was named his replacement. Claudia Leitte took a hiatus after season 5, swapping roles with Ivete Sangalo to become a coach on The Voice Kids. In 2019, it was announced that Iza will join Santos, Tel√≥ and Sangalo as coach of season 8 replacing Carlinhos Brown, making it the first season with two female coaches. With Brown's departure, Santos serves as the last remaining coach from the show's inaugural season. In 2020, it was announced that Ivete Sangalo, Iza, Lulu Santos and Michel Telo will all be returning for the ninth season confirmed by Globo. On July 29, 2020, it was announced that Carlinhos Brown would be returning after one season, who replaced Ivete Sangalo. {  style=\\"text- align:center; width:50%;\\" - ! colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=\\"2%\\"  Coach ! colspan=\\"12\\"  Seasons - ! width=\\"5%\\"  1 ! width=\\"5%\\"  2 ! width=\\"5%\\"  3 ! width=\\"5%\\"  4 ! width=\\"5%\\"  5 ! width=\\"5%\\"  6 ! width=\\"5%\\"  7 ! width=\\"5%\\"  8 ! width=\\"5%\\"  9 -  bgcolor=\\"D0F0C0\\"   Lulu  colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"D0F0C0\\"  -  bgcolor=\\"ccccff\\"   Brown  bgcolor=CCCCFF colspan=7   colspan=1  bgcolor=CCCCFF colspan=1  -  bgcolor=\\"pink\\"   Claudia  bgcolor=pink colspan=5   colspan=4 -  bgcolor=\\"ffe5b4\\"   Daniel  bgcolor=FFE5B4 colspan=3   colspan=6 -  bgcolor=\\"fffa73\\"   Tel√≥  colspan=3  colspan=\\"6\\" bgcolor=\\"fffa73\\"  -  bgcolor=\\"f78fb2\\"   Ivete  colspan=5  bgcolor=f78fb2 colspan=3   colspan=1 -  bgcolor=\\"afeeee\\"   Iza  colspan=7 colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"afeeee\\"  - } File:Lulu Santos, 2014.jpgLulu Santos (2012‚Äì) File:Carlinhos Brown no The Voice Brasil de 2012.jpgCarlinhos Brown (2012‚Äì2018, 2020‚Äì) File:Claudia Leitte no The Voice Brasil 2012.jpgClaudia Leitte (2012‚Äì2016) File:Daniel 2010.jpgDaniel (2012‚Äì2014) File:Michel Tel√≥ em Show.jpgMichel Tel√≥ (2015‚Äì) File:APC ivete sangalo cropped.jpgIvete Sangalo (2017‚àí2019) File:IZA em 2019.jpgIza (2019‚Äì) ===Hosts=== The show is hosted by sport journalist Tiago Leifert, who has hosted the series since the inaugural season, alongside Mariana Rios, who serves as co-host, backstage interviewer, online and social media correspondent since season 5.

He was pastor at Rochester in 1826-30. Attracted by the free church movement, in 1830 he went to New York City. The movement looked to provide church services to people who could not afford high pew rents. Parker organized the Dey Street Church in New York whose seats were free. He served as its pastor. In 1833, he was called to Louisiana to pastor First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans. In 1834 Rev. Parker went back up to New York to solicit subscriptions for a new church building. While away in New York rumors reached New Orleans that he had vilified the Roman Catholic community of New Orleans saint that \\"there were about 40,000 catholics in New Orleans, most of who were atheists (at least the men) and that they regarded religion as only good for women and servants\\". These reports were later proved to have been false, but before his returning November 1834 he was hung in effigy once or twice in the city. There were resolutions within the population of New Orleans demanding that First Presbyterian discharge him, but the congregation refused to bow to the pressure and Rev. Parker remained until June 1838 when he returned to New York.A History of the Presbyterian Church in Louisiana, Penrose St Amant, 1961, pgs 44-45 In 1838-40 he was in charge of the Tabernacle Presbyterian Church on Broadway in New York. Upon its being closed he became president of the Union Theological Seminary and occupied the chair of sacred rhetoric. He later held charges in Philadelphia in 1842-54, in New York at the Bleecker Street Presbyterian Church in 1854-63 and at Newark, New Jersey, in 1863-68. ==Literary work== He was for a time associate editor of the Presbyterian Quarterly Review and was author of: * Lectures on Unitarianism (New York, 1829) * Morals for a Young Student (1832) * Invitations to True Happiness (1843) * Notes on Twelve Psalms (1849) * Reasonings of a Pastor (1849) * Sermons (1852) * Pastor's Initiatory Catechism (1855) He edited the Sermons of Rev. John W. Adams, with a memoir (1851). ==NotesReferences== * ;Attribution * Category:1799 births Category:1873 deaths Category:American Presbyterian ministers Category:Hamilton College (New York) alumni Category:American editors Category:American non-fiction writers Category:Heads of universities and colleges in the United States ","title":"Joel Parker (clergyman)"},{"id":"35840287","text":"Oilville is an unincorporated community in Logan County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Logan County, West Virginia ","title":"Oilville, West Virginia"},{"id":"35840290","text":"Sharon Mathai, known professionally as Mathai, is an American singer. She was on the second season of NBC's The Voice and was one of the top 10 contestants. Trained in jazz during her childhood, Mathai started developing her vocal style around the age of sixteen with a sound reminiscent of Billie Holiday, Norah Jones, Nelly Furtado, and Adele, although two of her biggest influences are Johnny Cash and Amy Winehouse. ==Early life== Sharon Mathai was born on November 27, 1992 in Queens, New York, Mathai to parents from Kerala, India. She adopted the stage name Mathai, which is the name 'Matthew' in Malayalam, as derived from Hebrew. She had started singing at age 3, primarily in church events. When she was 10, her family moved to Dallas, Texas. Mathai attended Coppell High School and Texas Women's University. ==CareerBeginnings=== During the winter of 2010 she had the opportunity to perform during the AMTC convention in Orlando, Florida where she was discovered by two entertainment executives, and soon took a break from school to move to Atlanta to pursue her music career. In late 2010 she auditioned for The Glee Project, a spin-off from the television series GLEE on FOX. After advancing to the final round, she did not make the cast, but she was convinced that singing was what she wanted to do. In November 2011, on a dare from friends, Mathai auditioned for Season 2 of the talent competition series, The Voice on NBC. After making it through the blind auditions, her rendition of \\"Rumor Has It\\" by Adele's caused coaches (Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, and Cee-Lo Green) to turn around and woo her to join their team. Mathai joined Team Adam and over the next several weeks continued to advance before being eliminated after making the top ten. ===After The Voice=== Mathai collaborated with Lecrae on the track \\"Free From it All\\" from Gravity, which was released September 4, 2012 and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. Mathai's EP, Girl Like Me, was released on July 4, 2013. Her debut single, \\"Once Again,\\" was released on March 25, 2013. The EP was written and produced by Mathai and Grammy Award-winning producers Dru Castro and Pierre Medor. ==References== Category:American pop singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:The Voice (franchise) contestants Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:American female singer-songwriters Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American female singers of Indian descent Category:American female pop singers Category:People from Queens, New York Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:21st- century American women singers ","title":"Mathai (singer)"},{"id":"35840293","text":"Basketball is a part of the South Asian Games since the 1995 edition. ==Summaries== { class= style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:100%\\" - D0E6FF;\\" 1995 Details  (Madras) ''''''      - 1999 Details  (Kathmandu) ''''''      - D0E6FF;\\" 2004 Details  (Islamabad) ''''''      - 2010 Details  (Dhaka) '''''' 65‚Äì64   75‚Äì62  - D0E6FF;\\" 2019 Details  (Kathmandu)  101-62   81-59  - } ==Championships per nation (Incomplete)Participation Details== { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;\\" - bgcolor= Team  1995  1999  2004  2010  2016  Total - bgcolor=#D0E6FF   -  -  -  bgcolor=gold 1st  1 - bgcolor=#FFFFFF   ?  ?  ?  bgcolor=cc9966 3rd  ‚â•1 - bgcolor=#D0E6FF   -  -  -  -  0 - bgcolor=#FFFFFF   bgcolor=gold 1st  bgcolor=gold 1st  bgcolor=gold 1st  bgcolor=silver 2nd  4 - bgcolor=#D0E6FF   -  ?  ?  ?  ? - bgcolor=#FFFFFF   -  -  ?  4th  ‚â•1 - bgcolor=#D0E6FF   bgcolor=silver 2nd  bgcolor=silver 2nd  bgcolor=silver 2nd  ?  4 - bgcolor=#FFFFFF   ?  ?  ?  ?  ‚â•1 } ==References * Pakistan basketball team named for 11th South Asian Games, gz2010.cn, accessed 25 March 2012. * South Asian Games: Shooters, swimmers shine as India consolidate dominance, TimesOfIndia.com, accessed 16 May 2012.

In 1791 he became an indoor clerk in the custom house in Thames Street, London. A report which Hume wrote for the commissioners attracted the notice of William Huskisson, and he was appointed as controller of the customs. In 1822 he brought up the idea of consolidating the laws of the customs, and at the end of the year the Treasury excused him from ordinary duties for three years to pursue the work. The customs laws dated from the reign of Edward I of England and comprised 1500 statutes. Hume reduced them to ten: these ten Acts of Parliament received the royal assent in July 1825. Hume edited them with notes and indices. He was rewarded for his labour by a public grant of ¬£6,000, which he then lost by a bad investment. Hume was, in 1828, appointed joint secretary of the Board of Trade, and became assistant to Huskisson. From Hume had been employed on preparing a parliamentary bill regulating the silk duties. In 1831 he made an official tour through England, collecting information about silk manufacture, and in March 1832 he gave evidence before a committee of the House of Commons on the silk duties. He gave further evidence before another committee in 1840, and expressed a strong opinion against protective duties. He assisted Thomas Tooke in establishing the Political Economy Club, and from its founding in 1821 until 1841 attended its meetings regularly, and spoke repeatedly on free trade. The Customs' Benevolent Fund, originated in 1816 by Charles Ogilvy, was carried out by Hume, who was the first president. He advocated life assurance, and was one of the founders of the Atlas Assurance Company in 1808, and its deputy chairman to his death. In June 1835 he gave evidence before a committee on the timber duties, which were gradually reduced. Hume was associated as trustee of some private property with Henry Fauntleroy, and in September 1824 found that Fauntleroy had forged his name to a letter of attorney by which ¬£10,000 had been abstracted from the estate. The trial and execution of Fauntleroy followed Hume retired from the Board of Trade in 1840, and went to live at Reigate. He received a pension of ¬£1,500 a year. In the same year he gave evidence on the corn laws and on the duties on coffee, tea, and sugar, and his opinions in favour of the abolition of these duties quoted by Sir Robert Peel and other politicians. Hume lost his savings by poor investments. He died of apoplexy at Great Doods House, Reigate, on 12 January 1842, and was buried in Reigate churchyard. His death was mentioned by Peel on 9 February in the House of Commons. ==Works== Hume was the author of: * Thoughts on the Corn Laws, as connected with Agriculture, Commerce, and Finance, 1815. * The Laws of the Customs, 6 Geo. IV, c. 106-16, with notes, 1825‚Äì32, six parts. * The Laws of the Customs, 3 & 4 Gul. IV, c. 50-60, with notes, 1833-6, three parts. * Letters on the Corn Laws, by H. B. T., 1834; another edit., 1835. * Corn Laws. The Evidence of J. D. Hume on the Import Duties in 1839, 1842. In 1833-4 Hume sent seven letters to the Morning Post entitled Rights of the Working Classes. They were reprinted at the request of Sir Benjamin Hawes, and reached a second edition. ==Family== Hume married, on 4 June 1798, Frances Elizabeth, widow of Charles Ashwell of Grenada, and daughter of Edward Whitehouse of the custom house and a gentleman usher at the Court of St. James's. She died at East Bergholt, Suffolk, on 31 May 1854, leaving twelve children by Hume. ==References== * ;Attribution Category:1774 births Category:1842 deaths Category:English economists ","title":"James Deacon Hume"},{"id":"35840389","text":"Kelly is an unincorporated community in Logan County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Logan County, West Virginia ","title":"Kelly, West Virginia"},{"id":"35840395","text":"St Cyprian's Church is an episcopal church in Beech road, Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, Scotland.

The crash, with 44 fatalities, killed a number of Russian and Ukrainian aviation specialists. ==Crash== The aircraft was en route from Kharkiv in Ukraine to Isfahan in Iran, having stopped in Trabzon, Turkey to refuel. It hit high ground on a night-time descent to Isfahan International Airport, killing all on board. The passengers, including several Russian and Ukrainian specialists and officials, were headed for the official inauguration of Iran's version of another Antonov plane, the An-140 commuter airliner, which is licensed by the Antonov design bureau. Iranian officials at first said they believed pilot error was the cause of the crash, but later said it was too early to determine what caused the accident. A short summary of the report was published on the Flight Global website. ==Investigation== The aircraft's flight data recorder was recovered and the initial investigation into the crash stated that the primary cause was due to \\"procedural navigation errors by the crew\\". The Commonwealth of Independent States' Interstate Aviation Committee report concluded that the main causes of the crash were poor crew management, failing to apply approach procedures, and incorrect use of the aircraft's GPS satellite navigation system, in breach of its operational requirements and their rating for its use on approach; failure to use information from other installed navigation equipment; failure to seek an alternative approach when they realised the GPS could not be giving a realistic distance measuring equipment readout. ==See also== *Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 217 ==References== Antonov Antonov Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Antonov An-140 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Iran Category:December 2002 events in Asia ","title":"Aeromist-Kharkiv Flight 2137"},{"id":"35840423","text":"Kitchen is an unincorporated community in Logan County, West Virginia.

The main part of the site is a subterranean circular building approximately ten metres (~40 feet) in diameter similar to communal buildings in other nearby sites.

The species produces small, brown or yellow mushrooms with caps up to across, with stems up to long. The species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus Inocybe that also associate with willow, and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== Inocybe salicis was described and named by Robert K√ºhner in 1955 in the Bulletin Trimestriel de la Soci√©t√© Mycologique de France. Inocybe straminipes is a synonym of I. salicis. The former was originally described in 1979 by Henri Romagnesi, and had different spores from those of I. salicis. However, the holotype was reexamined in 2009 by Ukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen, who observed that the spores were in fact identical to those of I. salicis, which was described earlier, and so had precedence. The specific epithet salicis is in reference to Salix, the generic name for willow. Within the genus Inocybe, I. salicis belongs to the section Marginatae, which also includes I. obtusiuscula, I. dunensis, I. salicis- herbaceae, I. substellata, I. praetervisa, I. saliceticola and I. mixtilis. These species are all known to associate with willow, and all have macroscopic similarities. As such, they are best differentiated microscopically. ==Description== Inocybe salicis mushrooms have tawny to yellowish-brown caps of between in diameter. Their surface can be cracked, covered in fibres or scaly. The caps change in shape as the mushrooms mature; while younger specimens have campanulate (bell-shaped) to conical caps, the caps of older specimens expand and flatten, with a broad umbo emerging. The cap cuticle forms a cutis. The gills are almost free, meaning that they only just connect to the stem, and are initially a pale grey, becoming an ochre-grey (or brownish) as they age. The stem has a white to honey-coloured surface entirely covered in powdery granules. The stem is long by thick. There is a well- defined \\"bulb\\" at the base of the stem. The white flesh smells spermatic, but the scent is not distinctive. ===Microscopic characteristics=== Inocybe salicis produces spores of 9 to 11 by 6 to 8 micrometers (Œºm). In shape, they are elongated or curved, but they are covered with 10 to 15 distinctive blunt, semi-circular projections. The cystidia on the face and edge of the gills measure 50 to 70 by 12 to 25 Œºm with a cell wall 2 to 3 Œºm thick, and either taper at each end, or are shaped like swollen bottles, with the cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) more variable. The circumcystidia (cystidia on the margin of the cap) are club- or balloon-shaped, and caulocystidia can be found all the way down the stem. ==Distribution and habitat== Inocybe salicis favours wet land in willow woodland and clearings. Although widespread throughout its range in Europe, it is not commonly encountered. ==See also== *List of Inocybe species ==References== salicis Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi described in 1955 ","title":"Inocybe salicis"},{"id":"35840521","text":"Signature on Guardiagrele Duomo processional cross Nicola da Guardiagrele (born Nicola Gallucci or Nicola di Andrea di Pasquale; c. 1385/1390Page at Abruzzo region official website \\\\- c. 1462) was an Italian late medieval goldsmith, painter and etcher. ==Biography== Born at Guardiagrele, in what is now the province of Chieti, he was primarily influenced by Gothic art and by the contemporary Tuscan school of artists such as Lorenzo Ghiberti. He worked mostly as goldsmith, with numerous works dated and signed, although also sculptures and a panel painting are also attributed to him. His first known works, the cross of Roccaspinalveti and two monstrances, date from 1413-1418. Together with Paolo Romano and Pietro Paolo da Todi he had executed the twelve silver apostles which were in the Papal chapel before the Sack of Rome (1527). His other works include the antependium in the Cathedral of Teramo, an illuminated prayer book from c. 1420 (now at the Mus√©e Cond√©) and a Madonna dell'Umilt√† at the Uffizi. A sculpted Annunciation, of debated attribution, is at the Museo del Bargello in Florence.

This mask is denoted as male by the cartridge shells along the top and the wood carved leopard's teeth placed along the sides and bottom. === We people === The We, sometimes called the Krahn or Guere, are an indigenous African people that inhabit areas in eastern Liberia and western C√¥te d'Ivoire. In this region, masks such as this one typically start as simple, unadorned objects carved by a male artist. The mask is then handed down through generations with each new wearer adding adornments. According to the We, as each generation adds to the mask, it grows in ritual significance and power. The individual honored with wearing the mask traditionally wears an oversized skirt made of raffia fronds and may carry a ceremonial staff. We masks similar to this one are often designed to appear ferocious and are intended for use in mediations between community members, as visual aids during moral lessons, and as forms of entertainment. By portraying the more frightening nature of the animal, the mask is viewed as powerful and may have been used as part of social control methods prior to the introduction of Western law systems during the colonial period. == Acquisition == A detailed history of this mask is unknown.

Originally, Food Insurance only offered emergency kits to help people follow FEMA's guidelines. It has since expanded its product offering to include long- term emergency food supplies and non-food emergency supplies. Since its founding, Food Insurance has been endorsed by conservative talk radio show hosts Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity. These endorsements have given Food Insurance national recognition. It has also been the cause of some controversy as some have claimed that Glenn Beck is trying to profit from people's fears. == Emergency preparedness == With the emergence of groups such as American Preppers Network and shows like Doomsday Preppers, emergency preparedness has become mainstream. These groups believe in living in such a way as to be prepared for both natural, economic and political disasters. === Criticism === There has also been criticism of the prepper movement and of Food Insurance as being unnecessary. Included among the detractors is Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. Critics speak to the futility of owning an emergency food supply in the event of a global nuclear catastrophe. == Recognitions and charity work == Food Insurance was recognized as having the best tasting gourmet meals by the Food Storage Reviewer.

Between the years of 1824 and 1860, the centre of old Newcastle was basically demolished and rebuilt as a result of Richard Grainger's town planning exercise. The result was wider and cleaner streets, more attractive places of commerce and business, repositioning of the old traditional markets, and a loss of the old smelly slum areas, but also the loss of many historical areas, town walls and gates, etc. and tradition.

It is prepared by gradually adding flour to boiling water while stirring. It is a staple meal in various parts of Nepal and the Sikkim and Darjeeling regions of India. Though it is a staple food in Nepal, dhindo has previously been seen as an inferior food compared to rice, and was associated with low status. The inclusion of dhindo on urban restaurant menus has coincided with a rise in the food's prestige, possible attributed to the changing perception of Nepal's indigenous crops, which are now recognised for their nutritional advantage. == Preparation and serving == To prepare dhindo, water and flour are combined in a ratio of approximately three to one. While cooking, dhindo may have ghee, garlic, and salt added to it, or the ghee may be served as a separate accompaniment. The flour is added to the boiling water slowly, and stirred vigorously until the mixture is stiff. The process of making dhindo is called maskaaune (‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§â‡§®‡•á). Dhindo is traditionally prepared from ground buckwheat or millet, but corn meal is common as well. Theoretically, any flour can be used to make dhindo, as it is essentially a simple mixture of hot water and ground grain. Optionally, chopped mutton can be added to the dhindo, or small pieces or powder of soft chhurpi. The vessel of choice for preparing dhindo is (iron pan). A narrow iron spatula called a (‡§¶‡§æ‡§¨‡§ø‡§≤‡•ã) is used to stir the dhindo as it thickens. Dhindo is eaten by making a small ball with one's fingers, dipping it in a liquid (lentil soup, meat soup, milk or gundruk) and swallowing without chewing. In addition, it is often served with Chutney. == Nutrition == Millet is an alkaline food. http://www.realfoodforlife.com/millet-gluten-free- alkalizing/ == See also == * Nepalese cuisine * Indian cuisine * Ugali - a very similar preparation from Africa * Asida * Dal bhat * Polenta == References == Category:Nepalese cuisine Category:Bhutanese cuisine ","title":"Dhindo"},{"id":"35840957","text":"Skov is the Danish word for forest. == Surname == * Art Skov (1928-2009), hockey referee * Glen Skov (born 1931), hockey player * Kira Skov (born 1976), Danish singer * Peter Skov-Jensen (born 1971), Danish former professional football player * Rikke Skov (born 1980), Danish handball player * S√∏ren Skov (born 1954), Danish former professional football player * Shayne Skov (born 1990), American football player for college team Stanford Cardinal ==Place name== * Riis Skov * Rold Skov * Mollerup Skov * Gribskov Municipality Category:Danish-language surnames ","title":"Skov"},{"id":"35840963","text":"Git (, also Romanized as Gƒ´t) is a village in Qohestan Rural District, Qohestan District, Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

In 1790 the power of the falls were harnessed with the building of a new mill. The first settler there was George Wilson from North Carolina who built the first dam in the area. Some years after purchasing several thousand acres at the falls, Benjamin Sebastian, one of the first Kentucky Appellate Court judges, sold it all to Willis Green. In 1823 Willis Green built the house and store that still stand today. When the Falls of Rough post office originally opened in 1830 it bore Green's name. It was later renamed in 1850 for a nearby rapid on the Rough River. In 1855, the rock dam built by Willis Green washed out. Lafe Green borrowed $20,000 from B.F. Beard to rebuild it. The stonework in the new dam was done by Edgar Bennett and has thus far stood the trials of time. After years of operation the saw mill ran out of quality trees in the area and shut down in 1933. Between 1915 and 1920 the Greens owned over 8,000 acres of land making it the largest single farming operation in the state at the time. A flour mill also operated here.

He is a notable alumnus of the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux- Arts of Paris, where as a student in the late 1960s he played an instrumental role in successfully bringing French sculptor C√©sar Baldaccini as a Professor there, of whom he was to become a distinguished disciple and prot√©g√©. He was a co-designer of his eponymous C√©sar Award trophy, French cinema equivalent of the American Oscar. Ahmed Benyahia is the brother of Algerian French artist Samta Benyahia. and father of infographic artist and cartoonist Racim Benyahia. == Biography == Born on 11 May 1943, in what is today Chelghoum La√Ød (formerly known as Chateau-dun-du-Rhumel), Ahmed Benyahia received his early education there. He then grew up at the Rebain Cherif, for long considered the intellectual hub of the city of Constantine, a short distance from the school of the famous Algerian polymath and reformist Ben Badis. In 1957, at age 13, he joined Constantine's √âcole municipale des beaux-arts, then under French administration, which allowed him to teach painting, drawing, and history at the Hihi El Mekki High School in Kantara for a year. After distinguishing himself at ' in Algiers, where his works were featured on several major international events (such as, among others, the First International Forum of Algeria) in 1964, he moved to Paris in 1966, where he was admitted to the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. In 1972, he was awarded the post of professor at the University of Constantine, and in 1977 exhibited his artworks in the city for the first time. Subsequently, he staged a series of exhibitions in France. While in Constantine, he was commissioned to design a building to commemorate the life of Zighoud Youcef, who died in 1956 at the age of 35, and the Guelma memorial, which commemorates the victims of a massacre on 8 May 1945. == Paris: bringing C√©sar to les Beaux-arts == After moving to Paris, Ahmed's artistic talent would not go unnoticed by French sculptor C√©sar, who joined the faculty of the prestigious √âcole after a group of students headed by Ahmed urged him to become their Professor. The Board members of the √âcole nationale initially refused to grant a professorship to C√©sar, but were subsequently forced to reconsider their stance due to the students' pressure. Ahmed became the prot√©g√© of the renowned French artist. He worked on several projects under his supervision, and was co-designer of his eponymous C√©sar Award trophy, French cinema equivalent of the American Oscar. He is the mentor of Samta Benyahia. == Master and disciple: C√©sar and Ahmed Benyahia == Highly recommending the young Ahmed Benyahia to his friend, the architect Fernand Pouillon, C√©sar had this to say about his Algerian disciple: == Preserving the cultural heritage of Constantine == Ahmed Benyahia is also the founder and president of the Association for the Defense of the Old Rock of Constantine, which boasts a long history of striving for the preservation of the national heritage of the city of Constantine. Thanks to the intense activism of the association headed by Ahmed Benyahia, a great number of monuments and landmarks dating back to the Phoenician, Roman, and Ottoman era were saved from destruction, which was planned by the local authorities in order to initiate several new urban projects such as the construction of parking lots and tramway lines. Several of these monuments and landmarks were subsequently classified as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. == Family ties == He is the brother of Samta Benyahia of whom he was the mentor for several years, as well as the brother of the late Doctor Azzouz Benyahia of Constantine, who was the target of a political assassination during the Algerian legislative elections of 1997. Mohammed Seddik Benyahia, militant nationalist, former Minister of Foreign Affaires and architect of the liberation of the American hostages held in Iran after the Iranian revolution, is not a direct relative. He is however a member of the greater Benyahia family, who hails from the large Aures tribe of the Abdennours. He is the father of illustrator artist and cartoonist Racim Benyahia. == Some works == * Sculpture of the Emir Abdelkader, Mexico City, 1986 * Statue of the Military Academy of Cherchell, commemorating the Algerian Struggle for Independence * Sculpture of Algerian national hero Zighoud Youcef, 1975 * Co-designer of the C√©sar Award trophy, French cinema equivalent of the American Oscar, 1976 Following the designation of the Medina of Fez in Morocco as a world heritage site in 1981, Benyahia designed a commemorative medal for UNESCO, to celebrate its status.

It was presented by Greg James and Russell Kane. ==Format== In the show, presenters Greg and Russell try to find out what is weird and wonderful about the people of Britain. Over the course of six weeks, they asked a total of five-hundred questions to people, and put together the 'Britain Unzipped Report', made up of statistics taken from the overall answer to each question. Such questions include 'Have you ever woken up and had no idea where you were?' and 'would you watch a friends sex tape if it was leaked on the internet?'. They then ask these questions to a celebrity guest, and to special members of the audience, the 'Britain Unzipped Sample', which have been specifically chosen to be the most likely to give entertaining answers. James said of the series: \\"I'm pretty sure we live in a nation full of characters ‚Äì this show will find out once and for all just how weird we actually are. It'll also make me feel better about how often my Internet history is cleared!\\" Kane commented: \\"I am absolutely thrilled to be involved in this project. Given that I don't even have a clue who I am, I'm going to enjoy picking apart who everyone else is.\\" BBC Three controller Zai Bennett says of the series: \\"Britain Unzipped will be a unique show examining the state of the nation that is the BBC Three audience. With Greg and Russell at the helm it promises to be an irreverent and hilarious look at exactly what our audience are up to and what they think of one another.\\" On 11 June 2012, less than a week after the first series ended, it was announced that Britain Unzipped had been recommissioned for a second series. On 6 August 2012, it was announced on the official Facebook of BBC Three that Britain Unzipped would be returning as Unzipped and not as Britain Unzipped, though a reason for this has not yet been given. The second series began on BBC Three on 3 October 2012. ==Features== Features of the series include: * Normality Rating (Series 1-2) - Greg and Russell ask questions from the unzipped report to their celebrity guest(s), to find out if they are normal or abnormal. Their answers are calculated into a normality rating percentage and then placed on a chart which rates from boring to super weird. At the end of the series, the weirdest celebrity of all becomes the winner. * Man vs. Woman (Series 1) - Greg and Russell pit a man and woman against each other in a three question shootout, to see which gender is most down-to-earth. The winning gender receives a number of prizes based on their gender. ** The Reality Check (Series 2) - In the second series, the celebrity guest(s) play against two people from the unzipped sample under the same rules as Man vs. Woman but this thime, the prizes are based on or related to the celebrity guests who are present on the show that week, such as albums, books etc. * Celebs Unzipped (Series 1) - Greg and Russell invite their celebrity guest(s) to attempt to win booze for the entire audience by answering five questions correctly based on confessions made by nine celebrities for the celebrity guest to choose on a tic-tac-toe board. ** Celebrity Confessions (Series 2) - In the second series, the celebrity guests now need to answer three questions correctly to win booze for the audience and the tic-tac-toe board was replaced by a fictional spinning on-screen wheel to decide which of the celebrity confessions the celebrity guests will be attempting to answer. ==EpisodesSeries 1=== {  width=\\"60%\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !width=\\"5%\\"Episode !width=\\"20%\\"Air date !width=\\"20%\\"Guest(s) !width=\\"20%\\"Normality rating !width=\\"20%\\"Man vs. Woman - 1  Holly Willoughby   - 2  Christine Bleakley   - 3  Emily Atack Adam Deacon   - 4  Kimberly Wyatt   - 5  Charlie Brooks Tinchy Stryder   - 6  Chelsee Healey Joe Swash   } ===Series 2=== {  width=\\"60%\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !width=\\"5%\\"Episode !width=\\"20%\\"Air date !width=\\"20%\\"Guest(s) !width=\\"20%\\"Weirdo of the Week !width=\\"20%\\"The Reality Check - 1 3 October 2012 Anthony Joshua Sara Cox Anthony Joshua Sara Cox wins - 2 10 October 2012 Fearne Cotton Aiden Grimshaw Aiden Grimshaw Fearne wins - 3 17 October 2012 Nancy Dell'Olio Louis Smith Nancy Dell'Olio Nancy Dell'Olio wins - 4 24 October 2012 Emma Bunton Jade Jones Dappy Dappy Celebrities win - 5 31 October 2012 Harry Judd Danny Jones Amanda Byram Danny Jones Unzipped Sample win - 6 7 November 2012 Example Jerry Springer Heidi Range Example Unzipped Sample win - 7 14 November 2012 Danny Dyer Laura Whitmore Danny Dyer Celebrities win - 8 21 November 2012 The Best of Unzippedhttp://www.radiotimes.com/episode/szz7y/britain-unzipped--series-2 ---8-unzipped Nancy Dell'Olio1  } 1 Nancy Dell'Olio was voted 'Weirdo of the Series'. ==Transmissions== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

It is set in the town of Beszterceb√°nya (now Bansk√° Bystrica), describing the rural life of the peasantry in an undeveloped part of Upper Hungary (now Slovakia). ==Synopsis== The full text, in English, is available to download / Project Gutenberg The story is set is the rural region to the north of Hungary, now Slovakia, where Miksz√°th was born. This is the territory of the Pal√≥c people, celebrated by Miksz√°th in his writings, especially the short stories A J√≥ Pal√≥cok (translated as The Good People of Palocz). The characters in the story are small town middle class and the local peasantry. The novel is in five sections, the first establishing the legend of 'St Peter's umbrella'. The key character is the young priest, J√°nos B√©lyi, who has just arrived in his first parish, Glogova, so poor that the living barely supports a priest. Within a couple of weeks, a neighbour from his home village appears. He brings news of the priest's widowed mother's death, and deposits on him his two-year-old sister. How, J√°nos wonders, can he care for his sister when the parish hardly provides enough for him? He goes to the church to seek guidance, leaving little Veronica asleep in her basket on the verandah. A sudden storm with torrential rain interrupts his prayers and he hurries back to the sleeping child, only to find her perfectly dry, her basket covered by a ragged red umbrella. The villagers having seen an old Jew in the neighbourhood, with the umbrella, decide that he closely resembled the picture of Saint Peter in their church: they are convinced that the saint has visited their village. The red umbrella becomes a miraculous object of veneration, its widespread fame bringing visitors and prosperity to the village, and to its priest. The subsequent sections start with a flashback, many years earlier, in the nearby town of Besterceb√°nya. The key characters are P√°l Gregorics, and his son, Gyuri Wibra. P√°l, a socially awkward man, inherits a fortune from his mother - to the displeasure of his two elder half brothers and a half sister. When his cook gives birth to an illegitimate son, it is understood that P√°l is the father. He dotes on young Gyuri Wibra, and provides for his education. Regarded as an eccentric, P√°l always carries with him a red umbrella from which he refuses to be parted. Suspicious that his brothers and sister will seek to harm Gyuri's interests, P√°l secretly sells all his estates and property and deposits the cash in a bank, in exchange for a banker's draft for the entire amount to go to Gyuri. On his death, his Will is read out; the brothers are stupefied that there is no mention of any estates, no fortune; just a few insignificant bequests. Gyuri, now a celebrated young lawyer, is aware the missing money was to be his inheritance. Learning that P√°l had been a wartime spy and had a compartment made in the handle of his umbrella for carrying secret documents, Gyuri is convinced that a paper, proving his inheritance, is hidden in the handle. This would explain why P√°l never let the umbrella out of his sight. But by this time the umbrella had already been sold, along with other sundry possessions, to an old Jew who kept a second- hand shop but who had now disappeared. The subsequent sections follow Gyuri in his obsessive quest to track down the umbrella. The trail eventually leads him to Glogova; but before he arrives there, he meets a young girl, Veronica, and hears of her 'miraculous' red umbrella. Gyuri decides that the only way he can lay hands on his inheritance is to marry Veronica. She accepts him and he has the blessing of the parish priest, her brother. But the plan is thwarted when he discovers that the villagers of Glogova had paid to have the umbrella's wooden handle replaced with a more fitting silver one, and the old handle had been burnt: Gyuri's inheritance is lost. But with the loss comes the realisation that he wants to marry Veronica for herself, not to gain possession of his money. ==Film adaptations== The novel has been adapted for the screen on three occasions: a 1917 silent version St. Peter's Umbrella directed by Alexander Korda, a 1935 sound film St. Peter's Umbrella by G√©za von Cziffra and a 1958 film St. Peter's Umbrella co-directed by Frigyes B√°n and Vladislav Pavlovic. ==Bibliography== * Miksz√°th, K√°lm√°n, St Peter's Umbrella (trans.

The point is a triangle center and it is designated as X(181) in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC). The Apollonius center is also related to the Apollonius problem. In the literature, the term \\"Apollonius points\\" has also been used to refer to the isodynamic points of a triangle. This usage could also be justified on the ground that the isodynamic points are related to the three Apollonian circles associated with a triangle. The solution of the Apollonius problem has been known for centuries. But the Apollonius point was first noted in 1987. ==Definition== 280px The Apollonius point of a triangle is defined as follows. :Let ABC be any given triangle. Let the excircles of triangle ABC opposite to the vertices A, B, C be EA, EB, EC respectively. Let E be the circle which touches the three excircles EA, EB, EC such that the three excircles are within E. Let A' , B' , C' be the points of contact of the circle E with the three excircles. The lines AA' , BB' , CC' are concurrent. The point of concurrence is the Apollonius point of triangle ABC. The Apollonius problem is the problem of constructing a circle tangent to three given circles in a plane. In general, there are eight circles touching three given circles. The circle E referred to in the above definition is one of these eight circles touching the three excircles of triangle ABC. In Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers the circle E is the called the Apollonius circle of triangle ABC. == Trilinear coordinates== The trilinear coordinates of the Apollonius point are :\\\\frac{a(b+c)^2}{b+c-a} : \\\\frac{b(c+a)^2}{c+a-b} : \\\\frac{c(a+b)^2}{a+b-c} :=\\\\sin^2 A \\\\cos^2(\\\\frac{B}{2}-\\\\frac{C}{2}): \\\\sin^2B\\\\cos^2(\\\\frac{C}{2}-\\\\frac{A}{2}) : \\\\sin^2C\\\\cos^2(\\\\frac{A}{2}-\\\\frac{B}{2}). ==ReferencesSee also== *Apollonius' theorem *Apollonius of Perga (262‚Äì190 BC), geometer and astronomer *Apollonius problem *Apollonian circles *Isodynamic point of a triangle Category:Triangle centers ","title":"Apollonius point"},{"id":"35841153","text":"Danijel Korica (Serbian Cyrillic: –î–∞–Ω–∏—ò–µ–ª –ö–æ—Ä–∏—Ü–∞, born 10 June 1945), better known by his nickname Dane in his home country, is a Serbian retired long- distance runner who competed for Yugoslavia in the 1972 Summer Olympics. He is regarded as one of the greatest ever distance-runners from the areas of former Yugoslavia. ==Early life== Korica was born in Kutina to a family of six children. At the age of thirteen he suffered a serious leg injury from a freak accident for which he was immediately sent to the hospital. After his condition deteriorated, there was a possibility that he would have to spend the rest of his life in a wheel chair. After being sent to another emergency care center near Opatija, he began to recover. Korica was recommended by his doctors not to pursue a career in athletics. His idol growing up was Franjo Mihaliƒá. Korica's village had no track on which he could practice, so Korica often ran in the forest, many times barefoot. At the time, long-distance running was not a well-known occupation in Yugoslavia, and the villagers often looked at Korica as though he was crazy. One neighbor, assuming that Korica spent more time running than helping his parents, allegedly threatened if he ran on his property \\"with those nails on his shoes\\" (a reference to track spikes), that he would attack Korica with a hoe. ==Running career== Korica began training formally with AK Moslavina.

It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 25, 2012 and was shown in high definition in theaters across the United States and Canada on May 7, 2012. The subject of the film is the staging of a new production of Richard Wagner's four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Metropolitan Opera beginning in 2010. ==Description== Froemke, who has previously filmed at the opera house, claims that she was given no limits by the opera company in filming the documentary. The documentary captures the challenges of creating the new production, including a complex set designed by Carl Fillion of Ex Machina (Robert Lepage's production company). The opera house had expected the set to weigh only , so it‚Äôs only when the set was finally delivered that need to reinforce the floor of the stage's left wing (by adding beams under it) became known. Among the mishaps covered in the documentary are the failure of the set to work properly at the premiere of the first Ring opera, Das Rheingold, and Deborah Voigt in the role of Br√ºnnhilde falling and sliding down the set upon her entrance at the premiere of Die Walk√ºre. The documentary covers other challenges faced, including the Metropolitan Opera's music director being forced to step down as conductor before the last two productions premiered and the need for tenor Jay Hunter Morris to step into the title role of Siegfried just three days before its premiere. The film avoids making Lepage or Metropolitan Opera general manager Peter Gelb scapegoats for the challenges. James R. Oestreich of The New York Times claims that \\"the tone is basically adulatory, apart from a few skeptical notes sounded by ticket buyers and audience members,\\" and notes that Gelb and Lepage \\"cut heroic figures in an epic adventure.\\" David Patrick Stearns of The Philadelphia Inquirer was \\"charmed\\" by Voigt in the film. ==Cast== The cast of Wagner's Dream includes: *Robert Lepage *Peter Gelb *Deborah Voigt *Jay Hunter Morris *James Levine *Fabio Luisi *Lisette Oropesa ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack of Wagner's Dream incorporates Wagner's music. Oestreich particularly praises the use of the music from the descent to Nibelheim from the end of scene 2 of Das Rheingold to accompany the production's move from Quebec to New York. ==Critical reception== David Patrick Stearns of The Philadelphia Inquirer stated that \\"the film is destined to be one of the classic documentaries about opera.\\" James R. Oestreich of The New York Times felt it was \\"a bit long\\" but \\"beautifully made.\\" Ronnie Scheib of Variety called it \\"a highly entertaining outing for operaphiles and operaphobes alike.\\" John Terauds of Toronto.com stated that \\"It's a high-stakes gamble that Susan Froemke has captured [it] in all of its breast-plate-and-spear glory in a two-hour documentary that has as many hair-raising, stomach-churning moments as a ride on Wonderland‚Äôs new Leviathan.\\" Tom Huizenga of NPR called it a \\"meticulously unpacked if ultimately unmemorable diary of the company's high-stakes production.\\" Steve Smith of Time Out New York says \\"To its credit, Wagner‚Äôs Dream includes revealing footage of Promethean labors undertaken by cast and crew, misfires included.\\" ==See also== *Metropolitan Opera Live in HD ==References* Category:Documentary films about classical music and musicians Category:Documentary films about opera Category:Metropolitan Opera Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Richard Wagner ","title":"Wagner's Dream"},{"id":"35841173","text":"Dingle Marshes is a wildlife reserve on the North Sea coast of the English county of Suffolk.

They originally created toy prototypes for major toy companies such as Mattel, Galoob and Wild Planet. In 1999, Sideshow began marketing its own line of collectible and specialty products under the Sideshow brand, beginning with the Universal Classic Monsters 8\\" Action Figure license, which sold through Toys R Us and other mass market retailers. The company then began creating items in the sixth scale format that sold through specialty markets, at which time Sideshow switched their name from \\"toys\\" to \\"collectibles\\". Sideshow also flirted with a different paradigm for shopping, the concept of selling their product directly to their customers. This allowed them to provide more detailed, higher end products, offer direct customer service support, and to interact with collectors more closely from sale to delivery as well as through online communications and fan forums. Sideshow has continued to improve on this model, offering options like product pre-ordering, flexible payment plans, and a responsive 30-day Guarantee/ Returns policy to their customers, as well as focusing on the kind of quality and detail that attracts gaming, comic and film collectors alike. Sideshow has forged collaborative relationships with Hollywood filmmakers and special effect houses including Guillermo del Toro, Legacy Effects, Spectral Motion, Amalgamated Dynamics Inc. and KNB EFX to produce some of the most sought after collectibles based on movie props and pre-production film maquettes from blockbuster film's such as Iron Man, the Transformers, the Avengers, Hellboy, Predators, Alien 3, and Alien vs Predators. Sideshow Collectibles currently partners with Marvel, Disney, DreamWorks, WB, Lucasfilm, DC, Blizzard Entertainment, and others to create product from properties such as the Marvel Universe, the DC Universe, Star Wars, Alien & Predator, Terminator, The Lord of the Rings, G.I.

Sideshow Collectibles' products are currently sold in specialty, trend, collectible and comic shops both in the US and internationally, as well as online directly through Sideshow Collectibles. ==Production== A collectible at Sideshow starts out with conceptual art, which may be several layers deep. Then sculpting begins, primarily with traditional clay or wax sculpture tools. Digital rendering programs are also used, which are printed out in a rapid prototyping machine. The output is taken into the sculpture pool, and then cleaned up to bring in an additional layer of detail by human hand. 90% of the collectibles Sideshow makes are licensed properties. ==Licensed properties== * James Bond * Friday the 13th * Ghost Rider * Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull * Jaws * Jurassic Park * Spider-Man 3 * Star Wars * Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles * Terminator 2: Judgment Day * Terminator Salvation * Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen * Tremors News Editor, \\"TREMORS Graboid Maquette \\", Mania.com (January 24, 2006). * Tron: Evolution Tron: Evolution release date and Collector's Edition revealed  Joystiq *How To Train Your Dragon *How To Train Your Dragon 2 *Kung Fu Panda *Star Trek Monty Python and the Holy Grail Monty Python: Life of Brian ===DC Comics=== * Batman * Catwoman * Wonder Woman * Green Lantern * Harley Quinn * The Joker * Deathstroke * Poison Ivy * Superman * Aquaman * Darkseid * Huntress * Green Arrow * Swamp Thing * Killer Croc ===Marvel Comics=== * Deadpool * The Hulk Sideshow Collectibles Hulk Comiquette review  What's Your Obsession * Iron Man * Mary Jane Watson * Psylocke New From Sideshow Collectibles: Psylocke Premium Figure  News Marvel.com * The Thing * Thor * Ultron * Venom * Wolverine ===Television=== * Buffy the Vampire Slayer * G.I.

This he did and a few years later moved the school, named after the king, from the former Carmelite monastery into the hospital. In 1565, Queen Elizabeth I visited Coventry entering via Bishop Street Gate, and as she passed the school it was mentioned that her father had caused its foundation. She visited and gave a donation for its upkeep. ===Georgian period=== When the street outside of the Old Grammar School was widened in 1794, the half- timbered part of the building was demolished and the street was renamed to Hales Street. That same year, the west end of the church and the bell tower were also demolished. ===Victorian era onwards=== The King Henry VIII School moved to its present location in Warwick Road in 1885. After standing empty for over 20 years, it was announced in 2012 that plans were afoot to open the Old Grammar School as an offshoot of the Coventry Transport Museum. In March 2013 planning permission was granted to enable the restoration of the Old Grammar School to be used as an exhibit, education and event space. This included the demolition of an existing adjoining building with the construction of a replacement extension to provide disabled access to the Old Grammar School. The restoration formed part of a ¬£8.5 million redevelopment of the Coventry Transport Museum and began on 31 March 2014 with the Old Grammar School opening to the public on 4 July 2015. ==See also== *Grade I listed buildings in Coventry ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==External links== Category:Buildings and structures in Coventry Category:Grade I listed buildings in the West Midlands (county) ","title":"Old Grammar School, Coventry"},{"id":"35841248","text":"Gene Thomas is an American football player.

The culture was formed by interaction of migrants, who brought with them tradition of bronze metallurgy and advanced animal husbandry, with the local mix of Caucasoid-Mongoloid substrate.

Barnaul, Altai University, 2002, p. 183 In general, the migration wave of Andronovo cultural-historical community tribes pushed inhabitants of the Altai-Sayan foothills to the north toward the southern taiga zone, where their physical type (anthropologically ascended to the Southern Eurasian Anthropological Formation) conflated with local tribes (anthropologically ascended to the Northern Eurasian Anthropological Formation) and went on ethnogenesis of the Andronoid cultures.Chikisheva T.A., \\"Dynamics of anthropological differentiation\\", section Conclusions The phenotype features of Elunin people are distinctive. The Elunin culture developed from the local Bolshemys Eneolithic culture. In its formation participated a Caucasoid population of Eastern Mediterranean type, migrants from Central Asia. The migration started in the Eneolithic period and continued in the early and advanced bronze periods. Another ethnic component was associated with the East, and possibly northern Kazakhstan, they were people with ceramic comb-patch ornamentation, traceable to the nearest early Andronovo tribes of East Kazakhstan. Penetration starts in the final stages of the Elunin culture, and coincides with the area of Bolshemys settlements. The northern boundary of the penetration lies in the Novosibirsk Oblast. ==Economy== The mainstay of the Elunin economy was extensive animal husbandry, illustrated by tens of thousands bones and bone fragments found in a single settlement. The composition of the herds was 60% sheep, 25% horses, and 15% cattle.Tishkin A.A., Comprehensive Approach, p. 183 ==Bibliography== * * * ==References== Category:Archaeological cultures of Northern Asia Category:Bronze Age cultures of Asia Category:Archaeological cultures in Kazakhstan Category:Archaeological cultures in Russia Category:Finno-Ugric archaeological cultures Turkish ","title":"Elunin culture"},{"id":"35841325","text":"Kolohe Andino (born March 22, 1994 in San Clemente, California) is an American surfer.

He was a Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire from 1831‚Äì41. ==Family== He was the eldest son of William Addams Williams of Llangibby Castle, and Caroline Marsh; she was the daughter of Samuel Marsh, who served as Member of Parliament for Chippenham.historyofparliamentonline.org Marsh, Samuel (?1736‚Äì95), of Battersea, Surr. and Uxbridge, Mdx. Addams Williams married, through his connection and godfather Rev. George Avery Hatch, into a clerical family with a Welsh background at The Ham, Glamorgan. His wife, Anna Louisa Nicholl, was the daughter of Rev. Illtyd Nicholl, of Tredington parish in Worcestershire, and Anne Hatch (sister of George Avery); her brothers included Whitlock Nicholl the physician, and Illtyd Nicholl who inherited property near Usk. With his wife Anna Louisa, Addams Williams had four children; one son, also named William Addams Williams,Death of William Addams Williams of Llangibby Castle; England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995 and three daughters.

He became closely involved in local politics, and in particular in the Monmouth Boroughs constituency. He became the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1827. He was elected MP for the county constituency of Monmouthshire in 1831, as a Whig, at the time of the Great Reform Bill, after Sir Charles Morgan, 2nd Baronet as one of the sitting MPs had voted for a wrecking amendment. He was elected unopposed, a tribute to personal popularity rather than his reformist views, however.Gwent local history ‚Äì 79 Autumn 1995 A view of the county, c.1850, p. 10. He was in fact one of the small group of reformist pushing ministers to go further than the Reform Act of 1832 that resulted. Sir Hopton Williams, Addams Williams' great-great-grandfather, was the last person from the family to hold the Monmouth seat, in 1708. As MP, Addams Williams was involved in a Monmouth roads bill. He spoke against a private enclosure bill, for St Harmon, but it received a second reading. During his career Addams Williams ensured that both local and national newspapers were informed when they omitted or incorrectly inserted him in their published division lists. He resigned his seat in 1841, in bad health. ==References== Category:1787 births Category:1861 deaths Category:Welsh lawyers Category:19th-century Welsh lawyers Category:Whig (British political party) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:UK MPs 1831‚Äì1832 Category:UK MPs 1832‚Äì1835 Category:UK MPs 1835‚Äì1837 Category:UK MPs 1837‚Äì1841 Category:High Sheriffs of Monmouthshire ","title":"William Addams Williams"},{"id":"35841337","text":"Cultuzz Digital Media GmbH is an IT and Internet company that specializes in software for e-commerce in the travel and tourism industry.About Cultuzz It has its headquarters in Berlin, Germany and subsidiaries in Switzerland, India, UK and US.

Retrieved December 18, 2014. ==Running careerHigh school (1976-1980)=== When Brantly was at Winter Haven High School in 1976, he joined the cross-country team, coached by Buck Dawson. Dawson is a member of Morehead State University Hall of Fame who later went to coach high school cross-country and track in 1979 where he guided two runners to be future Olympians. When Brantly's running career soared as an individual in the fall of his senior year during the cross-country season, Dawson saw the potential he held. Brantly and one of his most memorable competitors, Basil Magee from Largo High School, challenged each other in multiple encounters such as the 1979 Astronaut Invitational and the 1979 Winter Haven Invitational, with Brantly falling just seconds behind Magee in both encounters. Towards the seasons end, there were two teams preparing for battle at the cross-country state championships in DeLand, Florida, Largo High School and Astronaut High School. All the while, Brantly was preparing for the title as champion. In the Florida class 4A High School State Cross Country Championships, Brantly (14:18) took an early lead to finally defeated Magee (14:30) in a rigorous five thousand meter footrace. Throughout the remainder of his senior year, Brantly and Magee grew closer in ability and competitiveness that carried into the spring track season. In 1980, Brantly would go to the Florida class 4A High School State Track Championships and win the 2-mile event in the time of 9:13. Brantly and Magee's competitive relationship did not stop at the state level, but at the national level where Magee (9:02) would outkick Brantly (9:03) at the 2-mile Postal Meet for the win. *1979 - Florida Class 4A High School State Cross Country Champion (14:18) *1980 - Florida Class 4A High School Track and Field 2 mile Champion (9:13) ===College (1980-1986)=== Brantly attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he would run collegiate cross-country and track under Coach John Randolph. As a college student athlete, naturally, it was easy to get distracted and lazy Brantly said. Randolph helped instill the discipline that he lacked. During his time as a Gator, Brantly continued to thrive as a runner by winning two Southeastern Conference (SEC) 10,000 meter championships. In an interview he explains that these were no easy feat, ‚ÄúThe University of Florida places a high emphasis on the SEC so winning was a very big deal.‚Äù Winning at this level played a huge role in his running career because it would later aid him in his quest for the Olympic team. *1982 - SEC 10,000 m Champion (30:18.23) *1982 - 5th place in 2 mile at NCAA Indoor Championships (8:49.92) *1983 - SEC 10,000 m Champion (29:48.1) *1983 - 5th place in 10,000 m at NCAA Championships (29:45.95) *1983 - SEC Cross Country Champion *1984 - 7th place in 10,000 m at NCAA Championships (28:39.82) === After College (1986-1998) === Following his collegiate career with the Florida Gators, he was mentored by David Martin who compiled his knowledge to transform him ‚Äúfrom a talented runner to a seasoned competitor‚Äù Brantly said. His competitive spirit and love for the sport continued to push him to further distances. The furthest distances he competed in before were the 5,000 meters, the 10,000 meters and an eighteen-mile training run. Brantly would run his first marathon (2:20:35) in Honolulu, Hawaii, and found that the training for this distance alone was a challenge in itself. In the 1993 New York City Marathon, Brantly (2:12:51) continued to improve placing fifth behind the elite marathoners. In the 1994 Boston Marathon (2:13:00), he trained to finish in the top five but fell behind at the halfway point, finishing twentieth. With years of experience and failing to make the United States Olympic team twice in previous years, Brantly's drive to make the team in 1996 was his main focus. At the 1996 Olympic Trials Marathon, Brantly used his previous failed attempts and knowledge from the New York and Boston Marathons to strategize making the team. ‚ÄúMy strategy at the 1996 Trials was to sit back, draft and stay warm until the final three players became clear.‚Äù Brantly said. Paul Zimmerman led the race until the fifteen mile marker where Bob Kempainen, Mark Coogan, and Keith Brantly would take control for the final 10,000 meters. Brantly would finish in a time of 2:13:22 placing third and locking him into the US Olympic team. At the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, Brantly gathered his thoughts and strategies for the biggest stage an athlete can compete on. He finished representing the United States in a time of 2:18:27 placing twenty-eighth. ==Competition record== { - !colspan=\\"6\\"Representing the - 1981 World Junior Cross Country Championships Madrid, Spain bgcolor=cc99663rd Junior race 22:07 - rowspan=21985 World University Games Kobe, Japan bgcolor=gold1st 10,000 m 29:11.24 - USA 10 km Road Championships Asbury Park, New Jersey bgcolor=gold1st 10 km 28:39 - 1987 USA 10 km Road Championships Asbury Park, New Jersey bgcolor=gold1st 10 km 28:47 - rowspan=21988 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Tampa, Florida bgcolor=silver2nd 5,000 m 13:45.16 - US Olympic Trials Indianapolis, Indiana 4th 5,000 m 13:47.87 - rowspan=21989 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Houston, Texas bgcolor=silver2nd 5,000 m 13:40.2 - USA 10 km Road Championships Raleigh, North Carolina bgcolor=gold1st 10 km 28:55 - 1992 US Olympic Trials Marathon Columbus, Ohio 4th Marathon 2:14:16 - rowspan=21993 USA 20 km Road Championships New Haven, Connecticut bgcolor=gold1st 20 km 59:55 - New York City Marathon New York City, New York 5th Marathon 2:12:49 - rowspan=31995 USA 10 km Road Championships New Orleans, Louisiana bgcolor=gold1st 10 km 29:12 - USA 25 km Road Championships Grand Rapids, Michigan bgcolor=gold1st 25 km 1:15:20 - USA Marathon Championships Charlotte, North Carolina bgcolor=gold1st Marathon 2:14:27 - rowspan=21996 US Olympic Trials Marathon Charlotte, North Carolina bgcolor=cc99663rd Marathon 2:13:22 - Olympic Games Atlanta, Georgia 28th Marathon 2:18:27 - 1998 USA Marathon Championships Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bgcolor=gold1st Marathon 2:12:31 } ==Personal records== {  - !Event !Time - 1500 m 3:40.7 - 5 km 13:36 - 10 km 28:02 - 15 km 42:50 - Half-marathon 1:01:30 - Marathon 2:12:31 } ==See also== * Florida Gators * List of University of Florida alumni * List of University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame members * List of University of Florida Olympians ==References== ;General * Cohen, Gary. \\"Keith Brantly Interview.\\" Garycohenrunning. 1 May 2009.

It is the 22nd installment of the NHL series. The game was released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, featuring Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux on the cover. The game was featured at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, which took place between June 5‚Äì7, 2012. The demo of the game was released on August 21‚Äì22, 2012, at the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store. An exclusive \\"Stanley Cup Collector's Edition\\" was also released, apart from the actual NHL 13 game. The Collector's Edition includes five random Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) player packs from the two 2012 Stanley Cup Finals teams; a Gold Jumbo HUT pack including legend Wayne Gretzky; and a boost pack featuring the CCM RBZ stick. On September 20, GamesIndustry.biz reported that NHL 13 had posted the best first week sales in the franchise's history. Giroux became the first Philadelphia Flyer to appear on an EA Sports NHL video game cover since Eric Lindros in NHL 99, as well as the first Philadelphia Flyer to appear on any ice hockey video game cover since Jeremy Roenick on ESPN NHL Hockey in 2003. With this, the Philadelphia Flyers have more cover athletes than any other team. == Features == All modes and features from NHL 12 remain in NHL 13. The following new features are included: * EA Sports Hockey IQ (AI): Makes CPU-controlled players and teammates smarter by reacting to everything on the ice, not just what they see in front of them. Skaters will be more easily able to prevent scoring opportunities. For goaltenders, Hockey IQ opens up for a lot of new different types of desperation saves as they are better able to identify \\"potential\\" scoring threats. As part of Hockey IQ, there are over five times as many strategy options in NHL 13 compared to previous titles of the current generation of the NHL series to replicate the real-life plays in the National Hockey League (NHL). Also, players can now develop their own plays and implement them for the computer AI in gameplay. According to Dean Richards, general manager of the NHL series, the development team spent more time on the AI development in NHL 13 than in the past three years combined. * True Performance Skating, a new skating engine based on physics, makes the player skating more dynamic and realistic with over 1,000 new animations created using motion capture. The engine is divided into three parts: explosiveness, top-end speed, and momentum. Explosiveness refers to how quickly a player can accelerate when gliding, being in a stationary state or how far a player can skate quickly. Top-end speed means that the players can skate as quickly as in real-life in their top speeds. Momentum is part of the physics; for example, a player skating at top speed may not turn around as quickly when carrying the puck as compared to when skating at normal speed or just gliding. Also, a player skating at top speed has his shooting and passing accuracies decreased. Momentum also means that players have a harder time recovering from mistakes. The new animations, combined with the Skill Stick features, allow for a lot of new plays and dekes that can be pulled off. True Performance Skating is taglined \\"Every Stride Matters\\". * Improved rating system: In NHL 12, each player's overall rating is based on that player's role in the team (playmaker, enforcer, defensive defenceman etc.). In NHL 13, however, the player's overall rating is based on that player's skill in their position (i.e. forward, defenceman, or goaltender). For example, in NHL 12, George Parros (at that time playing for the Anaheim Ducks) was rated 81 overall (out of 99) based on his role as an enforcer. In NHL 13, Parros' overall rating has been lowered down to 69 as determined by his skill as a forward. EA Sports stated that this was \\"a fan-requested change\\". Based on their attribute values, the players are now also given 5-star ratings for these six categories: shooting, puck skills, senses, skating, physical, and defense. Further, the teams' overall ratings for offense, defense and goaltending are now also 5-star based ratings instead of out-of-100 ones. * Team First Presentation aims to make the in-game experience more authentic than previously.

Although largely a silent film, Night Watch was the first of Korda's films to feature sound effects and music but no dialogue from Vitaphone.Kulik, Karol.

Afterward, Lieutenant D'Artelle asks Yvonne to stay on board with him, and when Corlaix (learning by classified wireless that war has been declared) abruptly orders her from the ship, she goes instead with D'Artelle to his cabin. The ship is sunk by a torpedo, and Corlaix is brought before the Admiralty Court on charges of incompetence. Yvonne comes forward to testify and, by compromising herself, proves her husband's adherence to duty. Corlaix, realizing Yvonne's great love for him, forgives her for her indiscretions, and they are reunited. ==Cast== * Billie Dove as Yvonne Corlaix * Paul Lukas as Captain Corlaix * Donald Reed as Lieutenant D'Artelle * Nicholas Soussanin as Officer Brambourg * Nicholas Bela as Leduc * George Periolat as Fargasson * William H.

She is daughter of King Saud. Her mother is Jamila bint Assad bin Ibrahim Al Mirhi from Latakia, Syria. Princess Fahda received primary educational at the Karimat High School in Riyadh until 1964. Then in 1969, she graduated from the Beirut Evangelical School for girls (BESG) in Beirut. She received her bachelor's degree in political science from Beirut College for Women (now the Lebanese American University) in 1974. She then obtained a master's degree in political sciences from the American University of Beirut in 1976. She then studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies for one year. There she participated in a non-degree research courses in the department of political science. Later, she moved to Paris to study art and was trained by late Iraqi artist Issam Al Said on Islamic geometric patterns. ==Activities== Princess Fahda is the founder as well as the head of( publishing and archiving) at The King Saud Library which collects, archives and publishes the history and legacy of King Saud. Princess Fahda also sits as the president of Al Faisaliyya Women's Welfare Society in Jeddah which she's chaired for over two decades, as well as head of Sleysla, a Cooperative Society, specialized in modernizing Saudi handy crafts and fashion in the city of jeddah using locally sourced raw materials with locally inspired TRADITIONAL designs and employing local women to produce them. Princess Fahda participated in some exhibitions that have feminist focus through her watercolours. One of such exhibitions was organized by the Royal Society of Fine Arts in Jordan and the Pan-Mediterranean Women Artists Network of Greece to eliminate the negative stereotypes concerning women across the Islamic world. The first exhibition was in Australia under the organization of the Interfaith Centre of Melbourne from 25 January to 23 March 2008. Princess Fahda's watercolour work in this exhibition entitled Three Women is a visual representation of the Japanese Golden Rule \\"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\\" so dominant in the Islamic world. She herself also organized exhibitions mainly concerning with her father's memory. Additionally, Princess Fahda supported the exhibitions of other artists in Saudi Arabia, for instance that of Farha Sayeed, an Indian artist who focuses on decoration of eggs. Princess Fahda painted the pictures of the book dedicated to her father published by King Saud foundation that was seen as part of the rehabilitation of King Saud. She is president of the Al Faisaliyah women's welfare society, that is a Jeddah-based organization mainly targeting women. ==Views== Princess Fahda wrote several articles on different topics in leading Saudi newspapers such as Okaz and Arab News, relating to social issues and Saudi history. In February 2007, her article entitled \\"Saudi women's concerns\\" was published in Al Hayat. There Princess Fahda clearly expressed that debate continuing about the rights of women in Saudi society has been \\"pivotal to the nation's renaissance.\\" However, she is described as a traditionalist, but not a reactionary. She supports reform towards women, but largely depending on the country's own values, including religious values. Interview with Fahda bint Saud was one of the interviews included in Mona Almunajjed's book entitled Saudi Women Speak: 24 Remarkable Women Tell Their Success Stories, published in 2011 by the Arab Institute for Research and Publishing in Amman and Beirut. ==Personal life== Fahda bint Saud has one child, a son, Abdulaziz.

Walker was the penultimate World Colored Heavyweight Champion from 9 October 1933, when he out-decisioned title holder George Godfrey in a 10-round fight at the Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to 20 July 1935, when he lost the title on a decision in a 15-round bout to former colored heavyweight champ Larry Gains on 20 July 1935 in Tigers Rugby Stadium, Leicester, England. A heavyweight contender of the 1930s, he was avoided by many boxers. Sportswriter Ed Danforth praised the \\"Bearcat\\" in the Atlanta Georgian in a column published on 5 July 1938: > \\"Walker became the toast of Paris.

Among the top heavyweight contenders he defeated was Two-Ton Tony Galento, who fought Joe Louis for the heavyweight championship. It was Louis's long reign as champ that ended the World Colored Heavyweight Title. In his career, Walker won 77 fights (53 by K.O.) and lost 16, with 5 draws.

The game was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in May 2012, and for Microsoft Windows systems in August 2012. It was later ported to OS X and Linux. Another version of the game, Awesomenauts Assemble!, incorporating all the changes and additions available on Windows, OS X and Linux, was released for the PlayStation 4 in March 2014 and for the Xbox One in September 2016. In May 2017, the PC version of the game transitioned to a free-to-play title, incorporating an in-game currency and reward system to allow players to gain access to new characters and other customization aspects. In September 2019, Ronimo Games announced that development on the game has stopped indefinitely. ==Gameplay== Split-screen mode for three local players, including the common megamap (bottom right) for all three. Awesomenauts is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) incorporating elements from 2D platformer and fighting games. At the start of a match, a player selects from one of the available characters known as \\"Awesomenauts\\". In addition to unique looks and voice-over work, each Awesomenaut has a vastly different set of base attributes such as health, movement speed, and attack strength, and regular and special attack moves. In the game's primary match mode, two teams of three characters, selected before the match, are pitted against each other, with the goal to destroy the other's team's Solar Collector within the enemy's team base before the others do the same. Both teams have to fight their way through enemy players, automatic drones, and turrets that block the path until destroyed. Some maps contain other obstacles, such as a giant pit monster that consumes anything immediately above it that can be summoned by standing on a button. Upon death, the player may respawn back at their base after a short delay that gets longer as the game progresses. Maps include health pickups and Solar units, the game's currency. When a player kills an enemy or a turret, every member of the team earns Solar. When a team destroys a turret, a super-drone is generated that can take and deal more damage as it heads towards the enemy base. As the player earns Solar, they can return to their base (either by moving there or through a short teleportation sequence) to heal and spend the Solar on various upgrades to these skill sets or character attributes. For each of four areas - the two special skills, the regular attack, and general attributes - the player can buy up to three of six available improvements, with some improvements which can be bought multiple times with benefits stacked. With the release of the \\"Starstorm\\" expansion, each match also features team experience and levels. The game starts both teams at level 1, and experience is collectively earned through killing enemy drones or Awesomenauts or taking out turrets. Each level slight improves base attribute values for all characters on that team, such as attack strength and healing rates, up to a maximum level of 20. The default game mode is ranked play, which puts players into 9 different ranks and attempts to match players within these ranks; Romino Games subsequently will reward players that finish at the top ranks on the completion of a season before resetting all rankings. The game's servers will adjust the player's ranking depending on their performance. Within ranked play, no team can have two or more players using the same Awesomenaut character. If necessary, computer-controlled opponents will be used to fill out a team, and if a player drops out of a match, they will be replaced by a computer opponent. Other modes allow for more variations but do not contribute towards ranking. Such modes include skirmishes where the singular character limit is removed, and round-robin modes where every time a player is killed, they are randomly assigned to a new Awesomenaut. Single and local players can also engage in practice matches against computer-controlled teams. ==Development== Awesomenauts was announced for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network on 19 May 2011 in a press release from publisher DTP Entertainment. The first playable build of the game was revealed for and played by the attending press at E3 2011. A release date of 2 May 2012 was later announced by developer Ronimo Games on 3 March 2012. The game was ported to Windows and Steam on 1 August 2012 with an OSX version arriving on 7 December 2012 and a Linux version on 29 May 2013. Ronimo Games announced a PlayStation 4 release, co-developed with Abstraction Games with improvements and updates from the PC version as well as DLC, on 14 August 2013, intended for release with the console's launch. The PlayStation 4 version, entitled Awesomenauts Assemble!, was released on 4 March 2014 following a delay to the console's launch window. On 2 June 2014, Ronimo Games announced an Xbox One version of the game, originally slated for Summer 2015 but later delayed to Fall of the same year. Built on the second version of in-house 2D engine Ronitech, originally developed for Swords & Soldiers, Awesomenauts was described by Ronimo Games' Joost van Dongen as a MOBA combined with platforming elements, similar to but significantly different from other games in the same genre such as League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients. Ronimo Games specifically created for the upgraded engine a number of real- time editing tools for levels, animations, and effects, largely non-existent in the development of previous titles, for use in developing the game. The game's art style and direction were stated by Ronimo Games as being inspired by colorful, over-the-top animated series from the 1980s. Music for the game was produced in partnership with award-winning Dutch recording studio SonicPicnic. The game has been updated regularly by Ronimo with new characters, balance changes, game modes, UI updates, visual overhauls, and matchmaking improvements since its release. === Starstorm expansion === In August 2013, Ronimo games started a Kickstarter campaign for additional content entitled Awesomenauts: Starstorm. The goal of the project was $125,000. By the end of the Kickstarter campaign, over $345,000 had been donated on via Kickstarter, with PayPal bringing the total to over $400,000. Several stretch goals were reached, including a new map, a replay system, and a spectator mode. In addition to the three new characters planned for the paid DLC expansion (Ted McPain, Skree, and Sentry X-58), two extra characters were included after stretch goals for them were met (Penny Fox and Nibbs). Ronimo Games' studio head Jasper Koning said the company opted to go to Kickstarter for further development due to their bad experiences with their console publisher DTP Entertainment, who had gone bankrupt after Awesomenauts released on console, but whom they still must pay from every sale of the game. === Overdrive expansion === A second paid DLC for Awesomenauts, named Awesomenauts: Overdrive and featuring three new characters (Professor Milton Yoolip, Chucho Krokk, and Jimmy and the LUX5000), was released on 3 March 2016. The release of the expansion was accompanied by the release of several new free features for all players, including matchmaking improvements, a new character (Ix the Interloper), and a graphical update for the character Sheriff Lonestar. Later Max Focus was also added to this expansion. === Transition to free-to-play === In April 2017, Ronimo announced that they would transition the personal computer version of the game into a free-to-play title by May 2017 with the game's 4.0 update, which was completed on 24 May 2017. In the free-to-play version, players earn in-game currency, Awesomepoints, for winning matches, which can be used to purchase characters, player icons, and other customization options in the game's store. Players gain experience towards a player level, while also leveling up each of the characters when they play as that character; leveling (player or character) will reward the player with Awesomepoints or other customization options. As many players had purchased the game and downloadable content before this point, Ronimo provided a transition scheme that those players were automatically given credit for owning specific characters and other customization options, along with unique customization options establishing the player as a \\"founder\\" to others. ==Reception== Upon release, Awesomenauts received fairly positive reviews, earning Metacritic scores of 75/100 and 77/100. The PlayStation 4 version of the game, Awesomenauts Assemble!, earned a Metacritic score of 74/100 following its release on 4 March 2014. Most critics have praised the game's utilization of streamlined elements of the MOBA genre and their accessibility to newcomers, especially those on consoles. GameSpot Austin Light noted that Awesomenauts \\"serves as an excellent introduction to the genre for the uninitiated and is a fun spin on familiar tropes for MOBA veterans.\\" In his review, IGN Mitch Dyer stated that the game \\"distills a complicated, largely PC-only genre down to its essence, and it does so mostly successfully.\\" ==Sales== The game sold close to one million copies by August 2013. ==References * Category:2012 video games Category:Indie video games Category:Multiplayer online battle arena games Category:Split- screen multiplayer games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox One games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Awesomenauts"},{"id":"35841483","text":"The Polish Writers' Union or the Union of Polish Writers (, ZLP) was established at a meeting of Polish writers and activists in Lublin behind the Soviet front line, during the liberation of Poland by the Red Army in 1944. Its initial name (Professional Union of Polish Writers) came from the similar organization formed in 1920 by renowned Polish novelist Stefan ≈ªeromski, called ZwiƒÖzek Zawodowy Literat√≥w Polskich which was deactivated during World War II. The name was shortened to Polish Writers' Union at the 1949 conference in Szczecin, in order to reflect the new government-imposed policy of Socialist realism in Poland advanced by the Polish communist party of that period. In the following years, the two official organs of ZLP were Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá monthly and the weekly Nowa Kultura. After the socialist revolution of 1956 the Union became less of a political arm of the United Workers' Party, and more of a true writers' organization devoted to creative output and the well- being of its members. In communist Poland, the ZLP was the only official representation of the country's literary community. In 1980, the Union consisted of 1,349 participants gathered in its 17 regional chapters. It had an annual budget set by the state with numerous special funds and permits allowing for food supplements, medical clinics, foreign travel, cars, vacations, stipends and cash prizes for the inner circle. Its leaders lived a life of privilege, while some of the writers are known to have worked for the secret police, spying on others. ==Martial law in Poland== On 13 December 1981 the authoritarian government of the People's Republic of Poland introduced martial law in an attempt to crush political opposition. Pro-democracy movements such as Solidarity were banned and their leaders detained. The Union of Polish Writers was suspended. Some of its dissident members were jailed and dozens blacklisted. At the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee meeting the writers loyal to the new regime condemned the leaders of ZLP as disreputable. The Union was disbanded in 1983. It was reinstated the same year by communist hardliners based on a new pledge of loyalty, which caused a deep rift in its highly politicized community. Many former members did not renew their cards. After the collapse of the Soviet union in 1989, the ZLP lost its state sponsorship. An alternative, new writers' union was also formed, called Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich (The Society of Polish Writers). As of now, both organizations have their headquarters at the Dom Literatury (Literary House) in Warsaw at ul. Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie street, in a historic building which they own collectively. ==Postwar presidents== *Julian Przybo≈õ (1944‚Äì1945) *Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz (1945‚Äì1946, 1947‚Äì1949, 1959‚Äì1980) *Kazimierz Czachowski (1946‚Äì1947) *Leon Kruczkowski (1949‚Äì1956) *Antoni S≈Çonimski (1956‚Äì1959) *Jan J√≥zef Szczepa≈Ñski (1980‚Äì1983) *Halina Auderska (1983‚Äì1986) after 1986, honorary president of ZLP *Wojciech ≈ªukrowski (1986‚Äì1989) *Piotr Kuncewicz (1990‚Äì2003) *Marek Wawrzkiewicz (2003‚Äì) ==Notes and referencesFurther reading== * Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich, SPP.

W. W. Norton) People of the Whale is a 2008 novel by Linda Hogan about a Native American man with a supernatural ability to breathe underwater named Thomas Just who is forced to come to terms with his experiences in Vietnam during the war. The novel is separated into three parts. Its chapter titles are known to use a lot of colons, and chapters greatly vary in length from 2 to sometimes 30 pages. == Plot == The novel begins with a brief prologue explaining the history of Dark River, the fictional reservation where the main character, Thomas Just, is born. The day of his birth, Thomas's mother holds him up to a giant octopus that can walk on land, asking for it to look after him, explaining that it knew his grandfather, Witka, a mystical man who used his ability to hold his breath underwater for long periods of time to act as the whale hunter for the tribe. As Thomas grows up, he loves the water like his grandfather and eventually marries a childhood friend named Ruth. They share an intimate marriage until one day at the drafts office, Thomas drunkenly signs up for the war with some of his friends, much to the sadness of Ruth. Ruth bears a child, Marco, named after the explorer Marco Polo, after Thomas leaves for Vietnam. Years pass as Ruth raises Marco; eventually the day comes when Thomas is supposed to return, but he does not. Instead, he disappears and is described as being ‚Äúmade up of lies.‚Äù Thomas has been changed by his experiences in Vietnam, and thoughts flow through his head, such as his cheating on his wife with a Vietnam woman named Ma, the sadness he experienced when the army took him away from Vietnam, and the faces of shot men from war scenes he was in. The novel flash-forwards to the year 1988. There have been rumors around the tribe about a plot to kill a whale, and Ruth, attempting to expose that the whale killing is only for money, takes a stand against the council behind it, which consists mainly of Thomas's old war friends. The whale hunt attracts the media, and Thomas, seeing this, decides to return to the tribe in order to try to find himself. He returns to the reservation, but refuses to talk to Ruth or Marco. The local men, led by Dwight, persuade Thomas to join them on the hunt. Marco has the job of listening for the whale, and on the day of the hunt, he is able to feel a whale as it approaches and expresses this to his father. When the whale appears, Thomas, without thinking, shoots the whale with his gun, and is suddenly flooded with harrowing memories of his experiences in the war. Chaos ensues the other men open fire on the whale, the canoe is flipped over, and Marco disappears. After returning, the men, excluding Thomas, carelessly leave the whale on the beach and go inside to watch a football game, causing Thomas to realize the tribe has abandoned its traditional values. Milton, one of the men who is mentally slow, says that someone with a big ring drowned Marco, but little of the tribe believes him. Thomas subsequently goes into mental withdrawal and builds a fence around Witka's home where he resides, further isolating himself from the rest of the tribe in the process. Dark River experiences a drought, with rain ceasing to fall and the ocean receding. Ruth decides to ask help from the Rain Priest, a mystical man said to be able to bring the rain back. She offers her boat, the Marco Polo, as sacrifice, and the Rain Priest arrives in Dark River and causes water to pour down for days. In the tribe, the rain reveals the history of the tribe ‚Äì seashell buildings built by ancestors in the distant past believed to have disappeared. It is revealed that Thomas has made a sacrifice, just like Ruth: he commits to traveling to Washington D.C. to return his medals and tell the army the truth and then to fly to Vietnam to find his daughter, Lin. Narration shifts to Thomas's experiences in the Vietnam War many years ago. He is described as never fitting in with the other men, who disrespected the dead and didn‚Äôt mind the brutal violence of war. One day, Thomas's troop flies to a wrong location, a town containing only poor children and women instead of an enemy camp they had been looking for. One of the troops, named Murphy, begins to attack an innocent young girl. As the others begin to attack other residents, Thomas suddenly fires his gun. He goes on to kill almost his entire platoon with little conscious thought, paralleling his jerk reaction of shooting the whale in Dark River years later. Thomas leaves his dog tags for the American army to find, disappearing into Vietnam society. He marries a local woman, Ma, and actively works to hide from being found by the U.S. Army. They give birth to their daughter, Lin, who Thomas attaches to over time. One day, however, Ma is killed by a land mine, and at her funeral, Thomas is found by the Americans and is taken away from his daughter, throwing him into sadness as he is forced away from a life he loves. As if to symbolize Thomas's removal from society, Hogan switches from the perspective of Thomas to the perspective of Lin. These chapters are some of the longest in the book and make up a lot of the second part. Lin recalls her life as an orphan after the death of Ma and the taking away of Thomas back to America by U.S. Troops. She remembers how sad her father was as he rose in the helicopter back to the U.S. and how she waited for him to come back, always holding the red fish he had bought her years ago. Forced away from her village because of soldiers closing in, she is presented with gruesome scenes of violence and corpses. She is grabbed by one of the young soldiers; they stare at each briefly, but the soldier lets her go. Eventually, she travels to Ho Chi Minh City, where she makes a living sweeping the streets. There, she is able to win the favor of a man in a flower shop on the street; realizing that she is homeless, he takes her under his wing and provides her with food. His wife is initially reluctant to accept her, though soon she gains affection for Lin because of the hard work she does. As she grows up, her affinity for knowledge causes her to take secret classes and study different languages on her own. Lin also has a knack for connecting missing family members, a skill which eventually becomes her job. She meets her future husband at an English class, who turns out to be the young soldier that let her go when she was running away from her village years ago. With her life now in order, she now resolves to find her father in America. Lin leaves her husband to visit Thomas in Dark River. It is here that she meets up with Ruth, of whom Lin's first impression is a strong, stubborn woman who stands up for what is right. Ruth is unusually enthusiastic to see her; she brings her to Thomas's home, where a shell-shocked Thomas is unable to speak or express his feelings. Lin brings him a red fish as memory of when Thomas bought one for her as a souvenir; however, it only reminds him of war and the loss of Marco. Lin leaves and Ruth is angered by Thomas's apparent dismissal of his own daughter. In part 3, Thomas goes to Washington, D.C. with Dwight and some other men to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. At the memorial, Thomas solemnly reflects on his life in Vietnam. He is reminded of the barren landscapes bombed and defoliated, and the hostility of his unit. He sees his own name on the wall with a circled cross next to it, and suddenly begins to cry as he thinks about the people in his troop that he killed. At the hotel, Thomas notices the ring Dwight is wearing, recalling Milton's statement about Marco being held down by a man with a ring. He turns against Dwight and accuses him of murdering his son, but Dwight denies the idea. Because of this encounter, Dwight decides later that he needs to ‚Äúkeep a watch‚Äù on Thomas. Meanwhile, Thomas tries to return the medals he earned for his service in Vietnam at The Pentagon; this does not go as he had wanted, as the truth Thomas reveals is ignored by the men, who tell him to let the past go. Back in Dark River, Thomas reconciles with Ruth. He explains that he wants to be remembered as a man of tradition rather than a man of war, and vows to get Dwight back for what he had done to the whale and their son. When he tells Ruth about how he shot the whale during the hunt, she gets angry that he went against Marco and dismisses him, though is partly understanding of his situation. Thomas and his men paddle on a canoe out into the water. He begins to sing ancient tribal songs, and Dwight, jealous of Thomas and possibly intimidated by the threat he poses, suddenly pulls out a pistol and shoots Thomas. Thomas falls into the water, apparently unaffected spiritually, and dies. However, his spirit is later seemingly reincarnated into his body by the Old Ones and he awakes a new, whole man. Dwight is arrested by his own friends and is put to justice. Months later, Thomas visits Ruth and her boyfriend Dick Russell, expressing his gratitude for all that she has done for him and that he intends to travel to Vietnam to see Lin. == Characters == *Thomas - The protagonist, who has a special power to breathe underwater. Born to the A‚Äôatsika people of the Dark River Native American reservation, he is the husband of both Ruth and Ma as well as the father of Marco Polo and Lin. As a soldier in Vietnam, Thomas never gets used to the constant violence and killing that comes with war, and he eventually ends up killing his entire platoon in order to prevent the attack of an innocent town. He disappears into normal societal Vietnam life and creates a family there, but years later the U.S. army forces him away. A Vietnam veteran with posttraumatic stress disorder, he is unable to face his old life or express his feelings. He attempts to reconnect with his tribe to resolve the conflict from within him, but finds the A‚Äôatsika people (mainly his old war friends who are corrupt and have accepted money from the Japanese to kill a whale) have abandoned their traditions. He goes into isolation after the death of his son, Marco, during the whale hunt, unable to face the ocean. Eventually, he resolves to return his war medals in Washington D.C. as a way of becoming a pure being of his tribe and letting go of his war life. He learns from the tribe elders about A‚Äôatsika traditions, and seemingly finds peace. When he is shot by Dwight, his spirit becomes one with the ocean, and he is reincarnated as a whole, harmonious human. *Ruth - Thomas's wife and the mother of Marco Polo, and a telepath. Born with gills, she has a natural affinity for the water, and ends up living on a boat, the Marco Polo, in the ocean. She is upset with Thomas's decision to enlist in the army, and so when he goes to Vietnam, she has to raise Marco all on her own. A devoted traditionalist, Ruth heavily protests the councilmen when they accept a deal from the Japanese to kill a whale under the guise of ‚Äúreturning to tradition;‚Äù even when the men destroy her property, she persists in trying to get them to stop. She is unsure of her feelings for Thomas when he comes back to Dark River decades after he left for war, but still cares for him and brings him food and water. When Lin comes to find her father, Ruth is very welcoming and caring, and it is implied that Ruth's friendly, almost motherly treatment of Lin is perhaps an attempt on her part to live vicariously through and be the parent Thomas never was, or is now incapable of being. When Thomas approaches her about their relationship, she is somewhat understanding, but angry when she finds out that Thomas went against Marco when he shot the whale. At the end of the novel after Thomas's reincarnation, Ruth has moved on from loving Thomas in a romantic sense, but still decided loves him in a brotherly way. *Lin - Thomas's bastard daughter from Vietnam. Growing up at a young age, she develops a special connection with her father, so when he is taken away by the U.S. Army, she is devastated. As an orphan, she is forced away from her home because of the war and makes a life on the streets in Ho Chi Minh City. With her clever intellect, she is able to gain the favor of a couple in a florist shop on the street, which provides her with shelter and food. She effectively makes a prosperous life for herself, taking classes and finding a job helping connect lost family members. When she travels to America to find her father, she is surprised that both America and Thomas are not what she expected ‚Äì she had heard glorified things about both, yet both end up different from her expectations. *Marco Polo - Thomas and Ruth's son, who is considered wise beyond his years. Raised from birth solely by Ruth, he shows a deep connection with the ocean, like his grandfather, Witka. Marco grows into a strong man, able to hear and feel the creatures in the ocean. He eventually learns he is destined to fulfill the role of listening for the whale during the hunt, an event in which he talks his father for the first time. When the whale approaches the boat, Marco senses the friendliness of the whale, much to the content of his father, but is drowned by Dwight during the chaos of when the whale is shot and killed. *Dwight - The antagonist. From the moment they met as kids, Dwight has been jealous of Thomas's abilities to hold his breath underwater. Because of this, he develops an increasingly hostile attitude toward him throughout the novel, first lying to Thomas during the war and telling him that Marco is not his son, then gradually coming to realize he needs to eliminate the threat Thomas poses because of Thomas's continual reprimanding of his actions. Dwight becomes a corrupt councilman for the tribe and organizes the whale hunt for the reward of money, and he drowns Marco during the hunt as well. When he visits Washington D.C. with Thomas and the other men, he is confronted by Thomas about the killing of Marco. Dwight denies the claims, deciding that he needs to get rid of Thomas in case he is exposed. When the men are back at the tribe on a boat, Thomas begins to sing a tribal song, and Dwight, still jealous of Thomas, pulls out his pistol and shoots Thomas, a crime for which he is subsequently arrested. *Witka - Thomas's grandfather. Witka was a highly regarded whaler known for his mystic ability to hold his breath underwater for extended periods of time. Acting as the messenger between the A‚Äôatsika people and ocean life, he helped the tribe practice the tradition of revering the whales and ocean. He became acquainted with the octopus and found that it liked shiny objects such as pearls and rings. == Connection to Native American culture == Throughout the novel, bits of Native American culture are embedded and intertwined with Thomas's story. Often, Hogan describes events from a perspective where readers must suspend their disbelief and look at the world from a different way (e.g. when Witka is able to seemingly communicate with his wife when he is underwater and his wife is on land, the fact Marco is able to see all life under the sea in visions, and Thomas's reincarnation), and in the story, Pacific Northwest Native American myths are true. The respect for whales and sea life stems from Inuit and Northwest Native American culture, where whales are believed to help people survive by offering themselves, therefore holding a position of reputation.Native American Whale Mythology This is apparent in Dark River, as whale hunting was a huge part of life for the Native Americans in the reservation, and they held whales in the highest regard. The A‚Äôatsika people sang many ancient songs that were passed down through many generations, which connects to the Native American tradition of expressing a tribe's history through music. The concept of spirits and the spirit world is a big part of Native American culture ‚Äì Pueblo peoples had rituals for the spirits while wearing masks (masks are found in the novel since Thomas's father makes them), and Navajo beliefs included trying to maintain harmony with the spirit world. A lot of tribes believed in the concept of humans having one soul that perished with the body and another soul that lived on,Native American Religion which connects to Thomas's soul living on after he was killed by Dwight. == Themes, Motifs, and Symbols == People of the Whale contains many symbols and motifs and also subtly conveys messages about Native Americans and relationships. # Water is used as an element to symbolize purity, honesty, and life. After Marco is drowned and the whale is untraditionally killed by Dwight and the other councilmen, the ocean recedes, as if to condemn the dishonesty in the tribe and the abandoning of tradition. When the rain returns, water pours down upon the tribe, revealing a whale killed by the white men as well as ancient seashell buildings built long ago. The water in a sense purifies the tribe, exposing how corrupt the men have been, as well as revealing more about the history of the tribe. The fact that Thomas cries as well when the ocean returns is a reference to water, since he at the moment promises to return his medals in Washington, an act of revealing the truth. The ocean also is the home to myriads of sea creatures, of which the people of the tribe revere. The sea represents life to the tribe, so much so to Thomas at the end of the novel that when he is killed, his spirit essentially becomes part of the water, as people of the tribe ‚Äúsaw him moving above water, dead, as if it was his soul, carried straight out to sea.‚Äù # The passing of time does not have any boundaries; we still contain the same roots inside us regardless of what we experience. This is shown in part by the octopus that appears multiple times throughout the novel. As an animal that is thought to be the Rain Priest, it appears during Witka's time during one of his trips underwater, was present when Thomas's mother held Thomas up and asked for it to look over him, climbed out of the Marco Polo after the returning of the rain to the tribe, and was rumored to have watched over Thomas after his death. The octopus is present through several generations from Witka to Thomas and Marco, and watches over Thomas during the course of his life. Because of Witka's generosity years back, the octopus still watches over his family line, looking out for Thomas even when his life is torn apart by war; even after becoming almost an entirely new person, Thomas still is able to find and bring out his past since his tribal roots are uneroded by time, just as the octopus remembers its past with Witka and looks over Thomas. And even after all the years Thomas was at war, he and Ruth still retain the capacity to care and love. Though Thomas is initially traumatized upon returning to the tribe and Ruth moves on at the end of the novel from loving Thomas in a romantic sense, they both still show they care for each other and that time did not completely erase their relationship. Thomas learns to venerate Ruth as a person who endured many hardships when he was gone, and Ruth shows affection for Lin because she still cares about Thomas and wishes to at least be a parental, loving figure that he never was able to be for Marco. This shows that even though their love has grown distant, the capability of caring remains unaffected by decades of war and separation. # The clash of culture and world society. Throughout the novel, readers can catch a glimpse of not only how Native American culture has been affected by colonization, but also how Vietnamese culture was severely disrupted by war. The gradual disappearance of such cultures is demonstrated by showing how larger ones engulf them. White American men such as Dwight possibly could represent all American colonists that came from Europe ‚Äì he nearly tears apart the traditions of Dark River through his organization of the corrupt whale hunt, hinting at how colonists subdued Native American culture centuries ago. In Vietnam, war completely eradicates many small cultures spread throughout the country, such as Lin's. Thomas settles in Vietnam as a way of escaping from the chaos and isolation he feels from war and moving into a unified, intimate community. However, war eventually catches up to him once again, and he is forced out of this life, with the village itself being destroyed by war just a few years later. Hogan is able to narrate the story in a way where readers are able to sympathize with the Vietnamese and Native Americans since readers can understand their precious traditions by looking at life from another viewpoint. A culture serves the purpose of guiding a group of people with stories, songs, and activities ‚Äì something that is clearly present in Dark River, but also in the village in Vietnam on a smaller scale, with the people sharing the common wish to just wanting to survive and stay away from war. The decline in these cultures conveys the detrimental effects of modern society on smaller cultures. # The concept of duality and doubles is omnipresent in the novel, especially in the description of Thomas's experiences and character. Thomas has two lives, two families, and is a part of two cultures; many things in the novel are also viewed from two perspectives. For example, Thomas's last name, Just, was given as a way of demeaning him, yet Lin looks at it as a name representing justice and balance, and Thomas's massacre of his troop is described as dishonorable, yet ‚Äúthe only, the most honorable thing he‚Äôd done the whole time.‚Äù These dualities are symbolic of the conflict within Thomas ‚Äì he struggles to resolve his two lives and find peace. By the end of the story, Thomas has corrected the imbalance in himself to become a whole individual again. He lets go of his war life but retains his experiences as a Vietnam villageman, and his two lives mix within him to ultimately make him spiritual and pure; his character conveys that the key to finding peace is to find balance within oneself. # Thomas shows his desire to prevent a loss of innocence throughout his life, with a prominent image of a fenced off land mine associated with it. In Vietnam, Thomas constantly disdains the violent practices of war, especially the killing of innocent Vietnamese citizens. When Murphy and the rest of Thomas's platoon begin attacking the village, Thomas stands up for the innocent people by shooting his men. He also pushes the new, innocent soldier in his troop, Mike, to safety in order to prevent him from being hurt. Later, he wishes to build fences around the land mines planted by the American soldiers in civilian areas to protect innocent people from being killed. Eventually, the mines do take the life of someone innocent ‚Äì his wife, Ma. His devastation after this event is understandable, as he is deeply upset that not only Ma's innocence was taken, but Lin's as well since Lin was exposed to such a sad event. His desire to protect innocence perhaps stems from his own loss of innocence; by being exposed to war, Thomas is deprived of his innocence through the traumatic events he experiences, and knowing how it feels, wants to prevent such a loss from happening in others. Upon returning to his tribe in America only to see that he cannot protect Marco's innocence, he withdraws from society partly due to his failure to prevent so many peoples‚Äô innocence. A loss of innocence is a loss of purity, so building a fence around his house acts to condemn the impure world he lives in; he can no longer face the clear water. Thomas is able to reach past this in the end and eventually become whole and pure, turning into a devoted traditionalist of the tribe who helps to spread faith, tradition, and honesty. == References == * Hogan, Linda.

The main doorway is early Romanesque, and there is a well-preserved early 16th-century sacrament house, similar to those at Deskford and Kinkell. The early 13th- century kirk has been roofless since the early 19th century, but the walls and gables are nevertheless in good condition. In the care of Historic Scotland, it is registered as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. ==Unusual survivor== St Mary's is rare for a Scottish church in that it has survived into the modern era without any major alterations. Although surviving medieval churches are reasonably common throughout the country, almost all were significantly altered during and after the Reformation, often so heavily transformed that it is difficult to see their medieval origins. Of the few other churches which have survived the Reformation largely intact, e.g. Rosslyn Chapel in Midlothian, nearly all are of a later date than Auchindoir. Another factor making Auchindoir unusual is that most surviving Romanesque structures in Scotland are either large monastic houses or cathedrals, or else chapels and churches associated with larger monastic or ecclesiastical complexes. As a modest parish church St Mary's is an unusual survivor. ==History== St Mary's Kirk was built in the early 13th century and served as the place of worship for the nearby motte and bailey castle, next to a gorge to the south-east of the church. First mentioned in 1236, the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. West of the church was a source called St Mary's Well, which was supposed to relieve toothache. In 1514 the church was elevated to a prebend of King's College in Aberdeen, thereby receiving the income of a canon. It was subsequently used as a parish church, surviving the Reformation largely intact. However, in the 17th century it was redecorated, with most of the lancet windows replaced with larger windows. In 1810, the church ceased to be used as a place of worship and the old timber work was sold publicly. The following year, a new village church‚Äîthe North Parish Church, also called Newton of Auchindoir‚Äîcame into use, and St Mary's was abandoned.Andrew Jervise: \\"Notes respecting the Castle of Craig and the Old Kirk of Auchindoir, etc., in Aberdeenshire\\", Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol.8, 1871. Pages: 328‚Äì9. ==Architectural features== The church has been described as one of Northern Scotland's finest specimens of 13th-century First-Pointed architecture. It is said to belong to the period when \\"the already softened features of the Norman were beginning to merge altogether into the still more flexile and varied forms of the First-Pointed style.\\" One peculiarity is that the church stands north and south rather than east and west.Descriptive Notices of the Ancient Parochial and Collegiate Churches of Scotland, London, 1848, Page 144. It had already lost its roof at the beginning of the 19th century but the walls of rubble and freestone quoins remain intact. The nave leads directly into the chancel without any structural division. Alterations were made in the first half of the 16th century and during the 17th century when doors and windows were added. The belfry on the west gable dates from 1664.\\"Auchindoir, St Mary's Church\\", Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. Retrieved 17 May 2012. One of the most impressive feature of St Mary's is its Norman-arched doorway with well-preserved chevron decorations. Standing next to the outer wall in the north-east corner of the church, a grave slab dated 1580 and dedicated to \\"O.L.H.M.\\" and \\"A.S.\\", together with the arms on the adjacent plaque, is associated with the Gordons of Craig from Craig Castle. Inside the church, at the east end of the north wall, there is a highly decorated sacrament house in the Second-Pointed style of the early 1500s, set in what used to be a lancet window.\\"St Mary's Kirk\\", Undiscovered Scotland. Retrieved 17 May 2012. It is surmounted by a representation of Christ on the cross. There is an inscription on the sacrament house that reads: \\"HIC‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢CORP D N I C V M\\" (HIC Est CORPus Domini Nostri Iesu Christi Virginis Mariae meaning \\"Here is the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Virgin Mary\\").Smith, Alexander (ed.)

It took place in Bab El Oued, a traditionally white working-class quarter of Algiers, from 23 March to 6 April 1962. ==ContextThe OAS uprising (19 March)=== Algeria: Tense Cease Fire Bab el Oued, 22 March 1962 The OAS was an organization of hard-line European \\"Pieds Noirs\\" living in (the then-French territory) Algeria who were opposed to the cease-fire announced by French president Charles de Gaulle on 19 March 1962 between French forces and the Front de lib√©ration nationale (FLN) forces fighting for Algerian Independence. The OAS decided to dig in at their stronghold of Bab El Oued (a traditionally European working-class area) to fight the Evian Agreements by force. ==Siege of Bab el Oued (from 23 March to 6 April)== The Battle of Bab el Oued was principally a battle between the French Gendarmerie Mobile and the OAS Commando Delta. The French government forces used M8 Greyhound armoured cars to control the exits to the town whilst suspicious buildings were surveilled from the air by T-6 and T-28 aircraft departing from Boufarik Air Base. Four T-6s strafed the roofs to clear them from snipers after Army helicopters dropped canisters with tear gas.Time magazine, Volume 8, p. 119. Time, Inc., 1962 As part of the attack, naval artillery support from the T 47 class destroyers Surcouf and Maill√©-Br√©z√© was planned, though it soon became evident that this was not practical and the bombardment was called off. Most of the troops setting siege to the quarter had been ferried to Algeria by Surcouf and Maill√©-Br√©z√©, along with other three destroyers, on 2 March.Labour research, Volume 51, p. 112. Labour Research Department, 1962 In support of Bab-el Oued, 200 OAS maquis marched from Algiers to Ouarsenis, a mountainous region between Oran and Algiers. They tried to capture two French military outposts and gain support from local Muslim tribes loyal to France, but instead these forces were harassed and eventually defeated by Legion units led by Colonel Albert Brothier after several days of fighting.Harrison, Alexander (1989).

On independence, the rue d'Isly which was named after the 1844 Battle of Isly was renamed in honour of the commander of the FLN Larbi Ben M'hidi The massacre on the rue d'Isly () was the action on 26 March in which a largely peaceful demonstration of pro- French Algeria Pied-Noirs against the blockade tried to force their way through French roadblocks around the Grande Poste (Great Post-Office). The protestors ran into a road block manned by 45 soldiers of the 4e r√©giment de tirailleurs alg√©riens (4e RTA) (4th regiment of Algerian riflemen) who fired on the crowd.

It is a simple structure without a standard architectural style. Five spaces for windows and doorways are present on each of the facade's two stories, while the ends rise to gables., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-13. Inside, many original details are present, including the fluting on the pilasters of the fireplace mantels, the oven in the fireplace and the delicate wooden molding in the kitchen, and the antique latches and locks on the doors. These elements are more significant than the little-changed exterior, as Ohio historic preservationists have few comparable opportunities to examine period interiors.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 161. Built in 1832, the Hostetter Inn takes its name from the original owners, a family named Hostetter, who were the proprietors until after the turn of the twentieth century. Throughout its history, the inn has experienced remarkably few changes; aside from miniature modifications on the exterior, nothing of the building's appearance has changed since its construction. As a result, and because most of the area's old houses have experienced major modifications, the old inn has become a highly significant part of the local built environment. Accordingly, in 1980, the inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it qualified both because of its architecture and its place in local history, being deemed important as a major part of the commercial life of Hanover Township and the community of Guilford. ==References== Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1832 Category:Buildings and structures in Columbiana County, Ohio Category:Hotels in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbiana County, Ohio Category:Vernacular architecture in Ohio ","title":"Hostetter Inn"},{"id":"35841646","text":"Sir William Bolton (died 1680) was an English merchant who was Lord Mayor of London in 1666.

An owl hole is a structural entrance built into buildings (such as mills and barns) to allow predatory birds, typically Barn Owls (Tyto alba), to enter. The birds prey on farm vermin, and therefore benefit the human owner of the structure in a symbiotic relationship. ==History== The Barn Owl feeds primarily on small vertebrates, particularly rodents. Studies have shown that an individual Barn Owl may eat one or more rodents per night; a nesting pair and their young can eat more than 1,000 rodents per year and have been referred to as 'nature's mousetraps'. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. Barn Owls consume more rodents than possibly any other creature. This makes the Barn Owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals to farmers, millers, etc. Farmers and others found these owls effective in keeping down rodent pests, and they encouraged Barn Owl habitation by providing nest sites.University of Florida Retrieved : 2012-05-16 In the few months between hatching and fledging a clutch of six owlets can consume up to of rodents.Building Barn Owl Boxes Retrieved : 2012-05-16 With the advent of modern pesticides the perceived value of biological control has dramatically decreased to the point that few owl holes are still in active use.

The perch or landing platform was made from stone or wood and usually sloped slightly downward to prevent rain water from entering the building. The entry holes are usually oblong and of a size 6 to 9 inches (152‚Äì228 mm)Peters, Page 16 that permits a single bird to enter with space for a safe landing and passage to the interior whilst at the same time excluding larger predators. Owl holes without landing platforms had grooves or rough surfaces beneath the hole to aid grip. On wooden buildings circular examples are sometimes found. The openings usually faced onto open ground so that they could be easily seen by barn owls seeking nesting sites. Owl holes also assisted ventilation within barns and provided for some extra illumination. File:Owl Hole - Roughwood.JPGTypical owl hole at Roughwood Farm, Scotland.

Opened on March 8, 2002, it includes JCPenney, Dillard's, and Bed Bath & Beyond as its anchor stores. ==History== Westcor first announced plans to build a mall east of Prescott on Arizona State Route 69 in 1998. The decision was met with local opposition from members of the community, and petitioned for a referendum after city council approved a change in zoning. Under Westcor's original plans, the proposed mall would have JCPenney, Sears and Dillard's as anchor stores. The former two stores were already anchors at an existing mall, Ponderosa Plaza, but the managers of both stores considered their existing locations too small. Following the referendum, a lawsuit was filed over the agreement made between the city and mall developers. The lawsuit was later dropped. Construction began on the mall in 2001. Besides the three anchor stores, other confirmed tenants at the mall included Barnes & Noble and Linens 'n Things, the latter of which was located in an outdoor village section in front of the mall. Although Westcor officials said that the diversity of the Prescott market made it difficult to choose tenants, they expected the mall to be over 96 percent leased by 2002. The mall opened to the public on March 8, 2002, with a \\"Party of the Year\\" the day before. Among the stores that were new to the Prescott market included Buckle, KB Toys and Casual Corner. It was 80 percent leased at opening, and increased to 86 percent a year later, adding 24 stores. After Linens 'n Things closed in 2008, it became a Bed Bath & Beyond in late 2009. Barnes & Noble, an original tenant, closed in 2011. Trader Joe's, announced in 2011, opened a store at the Shops at Prescott Gateway outparcel in 2012.

The class would later serve the Republic of China Navy and the Royal Hellenic Navy through the National Protection War, World War I, the Greco-Turkish War, the Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War, the Northern Expedition, Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. In 1910, Imperial regent Zaifeng, Prince Chun commissioned a 7-year plan for the modernization of the Qing Dynasty's Imperial Chinese Navy. Third-rank Prince Zaixun and Admiral Sa Zhenbing were sent on a whirlwind fact-finding tour of the West, starting in Europe in October 1909 (where Admiral Sa was awarded the Order of St Michael and St George) and continuing to the United States and Japan in 1910. The Naval Commission's findings suggested that a Ministry of the Navy be created, and on 4 December 1910 the Naval Commission was made into the Ministry of the Navy with Prince Zaixun as its first minister. The commission also suggested that the various Chinese navies be unified and divided into three separate fleets, Southern, Central and Northern. Part of the ambitious modernization program was the commissioning of new state-of-the- art ships for the Navy, battleships, cruisers, torpedo boats and submarines. The contract for the building of three Chao Ho-class training cruisers were awarded to two British and one American ship building yards in 1910.Rhoads, Edward J.M..

() was launched on 13 July 1911 from Vickers Limited at Barrow- in-Furness. The last of the class was Fei Hong () which was laid down on 12 May 1912 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and completed in November 1913.Wright, Richard N.J.. The Chinese Steam Navy 1862‚Äì1945. Chatham Publishing, 2000, p. 125-126. By this time China had undergone a wide-scale revolution, which had forced the abdication of Emperor Puyi, the collapse of the Qing government and the establishment of the Republic of China. The fledgling Chinese republic was uninterested in being saddled with the Manchu Qing dynasty's debts and dealings, so on 14 May 1914, Fƒìi H√≥ng, which had not yet been paid for or delivered, was sold to the Kingdom of Greece and renamed Elli (Greek: Œö/Œî ŒàŒªŒªŒ∑) after the decisive Battle of Elli of 1912, by the New York Shipbuilding Company. The Chao Ho-class cruisers were unusual in that all three semi-sister ships were built in different ship building yards, and although all three ships were built to the same basic design, they varied in size, displacement, armour and boiler types, and all three ships carried varied assortments of guns (as opposed to uniform main armament). These were done to increase the educational effectiveness of the ships, in order to familiarize their crews with various boiler and weapons systems. The class was notable for being the first Chinese ships to use Parson steam turbines. While the primary fuel for the Chao Ho class remained coal, these were the first Chinese ships to carry oil for fuel as well.Gray, Randall.

It displays a rich collection of art works acquired over the centuries on a total area of distributed as follows: * for permanent collections * for temporary exhibitions * for the public reception areas: lobbies, passing museums, auditorium, video room, coffee shop ... * for technical buildings Thanks to recent restoration the site combines history and development with the most modern presentation. The museum has been classified by the Journal des Arts Museum on 2010 as the best of western France and fourth museum in France (outside Paris). This ranking is due to a redesign of the museum's website and the richness and diversity of the exhibitions. ==History== After the French Revolution, the Directory founded \\"Ecole Centrales\\" (central schools), and that of Maine-et-Loire was transferred to the Logis Barrault mansion. In May 1801, the museum of the Ecole Centrale de Maine-et-Loire opened its doors, modeled on the Louvre. In 1803, the Central Schools were closed, but the municipality of Angers decided to preserve the museum of painting. The natural history museum and municipal library opened in 1805. The museum is considered to be one of the richest in all the neighboring departments, and after that of Paris it would be one of the finest in France. In the two centuries that followed the museum came to have a critical lack of space and obsolete facilities, but this did not prevent the museum from receiving regular bequests and prestigious gifts, including those of Pierre- Jean David, called David d'Angers. In 1839 the David d'Angers Gallery was inaugurated in the former refectory of the museum (where it remained until 1984). In 1859, Lancelot-Th√©odore Turpin de Criss√© enriched the museum's collection with a considerable legacy: Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiques, ancient bronzes, Greek vases, glasses, enamels and pottery, as well as many paintings including some by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (Paolo and Francesca) and some primitives including a triptych of the School of Avignon. He had built up a collection that reflected the eclectic tastes of the Restoration, with an estimated total value of nearly one million francs at the time. In 1861 the painter Guillaume Bodinier offered the city the h√¥tel Pinc√© - mus√©e Pinc√© - to house the objects of the Turpin de Criss√© collection. In 1887 the Beaurepaire gallery was inaugurated, built perpendicularly to the David d'Angers gallery and designed by city architect Charles Demoget. Works presented included The Dance, a controversial sculpture by Charles Gumery, and The Death of Priam by Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin. At the beginning of twentieth century expansion projects were initiated. A new public entrance appeared in order to make the museum more visible. But the project fails. In 1944 the museum is devastated by the war and was placed, two years later, on the list of classified provincial museums. From 1949 the museum was hastily reorganized, and reopened in 1950. The Conservators had to adapt to the constraints of the site without being able to really enhance the collections. In 1977 the City foresaw a redevelopment of the Museum of Fine Arts. In 1980 it was decided to first move the library, and then to transfer the David d'Angers gallery to the Church of All Saints Abbey of Angers. In 1984 Fran√ßois Mitterrand inaugurated the new David d'Angers gallery. In 1998 the City approved the scientific and cultural project presented by Patrick Nou√´ne, Director and Chief Curator of the Museums of Angers. Between 1999 and 2004 massive renovations, transformation and enlargement were orchestrated by two famous architects: *Gabor Mester de Parajd, Chief Architect of Historic Monuments, had already completed several major projects in Maine-et-Loire, the Cathedral of St. Maurice d'Angers and the Abbey of Fontevraud. He took charge of the restoration of the heritage listed logis Barrault and the old parts, in the purest respect of architectural and historical references. \\"The Museum of Fine Arts is a jumble of styles and constructions. Our aim was to enhance the identity of every age and harmonize all the buildings. On the facades, we wanted to preserve the authentic rather than hiring a new restoration. Intramural, some tinkering done over the centuries led us to conduct historical studies and many soundings. We had to takeaccount of discoveries made at the site. For example, we replaced the vaulted loggia, one of the peculiarities of the house Barrault.\\" *Antoine Stinco (museographer architect) who participated in the creation of the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Toulouse and the National Gallery of Jeu de Paume in Paris. For the Museum of Fine Arts in Angers, he devoted himself to the renovation of the most recent additions, to create entirely new spaces. \\"My first goal was to stage a lively place that facilitates the discovery and fosters curiosity of audiences. I'm not trying to copy the past using the same architectural style. My mission was to create new spaces in relation to their function.\\" In 2003 the city of Angers received, by bequest of its last owner and contributor, Mr. Daniel Duclaux, the Villev√™que castle and the extensive collection of art objects it contains. Among this rich collection of over 900 works, hundreds of pieces of antique furniture, some sixty old books, manuscripts and incunabula, Italian ceramics and Hispano-Moorish enamels of Limousin, 70 works of art, sculptures in stone or polychrome wood from the Middle Ageas, tapestries from Flanders in the Renaissance period. The same year the Mus√©e-Ch√¢teau de Villev√™que was opened to the public, attached to the Angers Museum of Fine Arts. ==Permanent collections== Les G√©nies des Arts by Fran√ßois Boucher (1703-1770) Gianciotto Discovers Paolo and Francesca by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (1780‚Äì1867) Works from many gifts, bequests, deposits or acquisitions are located in the historic rooms of the museum. 900 of them are exposed on the 1700 account as the Museum of Fine Arts. About 150 underwent fundamental restoration during construction. They are divided into two separate permanent tours: ===The \\"fine art\\" tour=== This tour presents a rich collection of paintings punctuated by artwork and sculptures that tells chronologically the different artistic movements from the fourteenth to the twenty first centuries. Two rooms on the first floor, restored by the Historic Buildings society, are devoted to 14th-century Primitives (French, Italian and Flemish) and objects of art from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, but also to Northern, French and Italian schools of the 16th and 17th centuries. These rooms hold works of Segna di Bonaventura, Benvenuto Tisi, Jehan Bellegambe, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrick van Balen, Frans Franken, Jacob Jordaens (Self Portrait), Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem, Jan Asselijn, Jan van Kessel, Willem van Mieris, Jacob van Ruisdael, Theodoor van Thulden, Jacob Foppens van Es, David Teniers the Younger, Philippe de Champaigne, Charles Le Brun, Charles de La Fosse, Jacques Stella, Pierre Mignard, Antoine Coypel, Sisto Badalocchio, Pier Francesco Mola, Giovanni Battista Vanni, Lorenzo Lippi (Allegory of the simulation), Luca Giordano, Francesco Solimena, Francesco Guardi and of Giambattista Tiepolo with his famous Apotheosis of the Pisani house, a sketch for the ceiling of the Villa Pisani at Stra in Veneto. On the second floor, visitors can discover the works of the eighteenth in the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, and the large paintings of the early nineteenth century. For the eighteenth century French strong point of the museum collections, there are paintings of Antoine Watteau, Fran√ßois Desportes, Carle Van Loo, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard (two sketches, The Hunt and The Surprise, the paintings Cephalus and Procris, Jupiter, the guise of Diana, seduced Callisto, and Coresus Callirrhoe and another sketch, The Nymph lo and Jupiter), Fran√ßois Boucher, Jean-Francois de Troy, Noel Halle, Nicolas Lancret, Jean-Baptiste Pater, Jean-Baptiste Chardin with his masterful still lifes, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Hubert Robert, Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent, Jacques-Louis David and Joseph- Marie Vien. Among sculptures are the famous bust of Voltaire by Jean-Antoine Houdon. The first half of the nineteenth century is represented with works of Ingres, Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin, Camille Corot, Ary Scheffer, Eug√®ne Dev√©ria, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and others. Upstairs, a large room is dedicated to modern art of the twentieth century and contemporary art, and on the ground floor the Gumery room has large canvases from the late nineteenth century and sculptures. These include works by Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin, Henri Gervex and other large academic pictures of the nineteenth century. From the second half of the century it presents works of Eug√®ne Boudin, Johan Barthold Jongkind, Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Henri Lebasque and Albert Lebourg. From the twentieth century the museum includes Maurice Denis, Maxime Maufra, Louis Valtat and Angevin Alexis M√©rodack-Jeaneau, as well as contemporary works of Fran√ßois Morellet, Jean-Pierre Pincemin and Daniel Tremblay. ===The \\"History of Angers\\" tour=== A gallery of archaeological artifacts and works of decorative art has been created from the collections of the former Museum of Antiquities, excavations at Angers and acquisitions. It shows the development of the city of Angers from its origins to contemporary urban development projects. The old and new archaeological discoveries reveal the first traces of the site in the Neolithic and the creation of the Gallo-Roman city named Juliomagus. Fragments of stone and wood evoke the sculptural decoration of churches and wooden-walled houses. The social, economic and cultural importance is illustrated by an iconography: portraits, city views and photographs. ==Exhibitions== Demande de mariage by Guillaume Bodinier (1795‚Äì1872) Two or three temporary exhibitions are presented annually at the museum in the temporary exhibition hall, such as works of Niki de Saint Phalle in 2004 or Fran√ßois Morellet in 2006. Some exhibitions are now held in permanent collections, such as the 2008 exhibition of Agn√®s Thurnauer. ===Past exhibitions=== *Morellet 1926-2006 etc. ...

He was of Quaker extraction. ==Pre-Civil War life== Gurney went to New York City in 1837, and obtained employment as a clerk in the wholesale establishment of A.N. Brown, in Dey street. He became a junior partner of Mr. Brown, and afterward the head of the firm of Gurney & Underhill, which succeeded the old firm. He was one of the originators of the Five Points Mission in New York City. ==Masonic affiliations== Gurney was affiliated with many Masonic lodges including Adelphic and Arcana and in 1853 was one of the founders of Continental Lodge No. 287 Free and Accepted Masons in the state of New York. He was also a member of Adelphi Chapter and Morton Commandery. ==Military service== Gurney always took an active interest in the Militia, and was originally a member of the Eighth Regiment. At the outbreak of the American Civil War he was a First Lieutenant in the Seventh Regiment, which he accompanied during its three months' term of service. On his return to New York City he accepted a captain's commission in the Sixty-fifth Regiment, New York Volunteers, commanded by Col. John Cochrane. In 1862 he was appointed Assistant Inspector-General and Examining Officer on the staff of Gov. Morgan, in which position he was required to pass upon the qualifications of persons applying for commissions in the regiments of the State of New York. On July 10, 1862 Gurney received authority to raise a regiment, and in 30 days recruited the 127th New York Volunteer Infantry. It was organized on Staten Island September 8, 1862. Gurney returned to the front at the head of this unit. Later in 1862 he was assigned to the command of the Second Brigade in Gen. Abercrombie's Division. In 1863, he was leading a division in the Department of Virginia forces. In 1864 he joined the command of Gen. Q.A. Gillmore, who was then operating on the South Carolina coast. He was severely wounded at Denoe's Neck, near Charleston, in December 1864, and was sent North for medical treatment. On his recovery, he returned south and was assigned to duty as Commander of the post at Charleston, taking over the job from Stewart Woodford. While in this position, Gurney was involved in an incident with Stephen Atkins Swails, the first African American Commissioned Officer. He was promoted for gallantry in action to the rank of brigadier general. Gurney returned to New York in July, 1865, where he was mustered out of the service. The 127th New York Volunteers he had raised was mustered out on June 30, 1865 after three years of service to the United States. ==Post Civil War life== Gurney went back with his family to Charleston, where he established himself as a merchant and cotton factor. In 1870 Gurney was appointed Treasurer of Charleston County. He was a member of the Electoral College in 1872 from South Carolina, and was the Commissioner from that State in the Centennial Exposition. He continued to reside in Charleston until about 1878, when he came North on account of his health. ==References== *The New York Times, February 3, 1879 ==External links== * localhistory.morrisville.edu Category:1821 births Category:1879 deaths Category:Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery Category:Union Army generals ","title":"William Gurney"},{"id":"35841953","text":"Abdelkader Ch√©kh√©mani (born 18 July 1971 in Barentin) is a French former middle distance runner who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==Competition record== { - !colspan=\\"6\\"Representing - 1993 Universiade Buffalo, United States bgcolor=gold1st 1500 m 3:46.32 - rowspan=31994 European Indoor Championships Paris, France bgcolor=cc99663rd 1500 m 3:44.65 - Jeux de la Francophonie Paris, France bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:43.08 - European Championships Helsinki, Finland 8th 1500 m 3:38.42 - rowspan=21995 World Championships Gothenburg, Sweden 6th 1500 m 3:36.90 - Universiade Fukuoka, Japan bgcolor=gold1st 1500 m 3:46.53 - rowspan=21996 European Indoor Championships Stockholm, Sweden bgcolor=cc99663rd 1500 m 3:45.96 - Olympic Games Atlanta, United States 8th (sf) 1500 m 3:34.84 - 1997 World Indoor Championships Paris, France 12th 1500 m 3:49.47 - rowspan=21998 European Indoor Championships Valencia, Spain bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:44.89 - European Championships Budapest, Hungary 8th 1500 m 3:42.92 - 1999 World Championships Seville, Spain 9th (sf) 1500 m 3:37.77 } ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:French male middle- distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of France Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:People from Barentin Category:Sportspeople from Seine-Maritime Category:Universiade gold medalists for France Category:Medalists at the 1995 Summer Universiade Category:Medalists at the 1993 Summer Universiade ","title":"Abdelkader Ch√©kh√©mani"},{"id":"35841955","text":"Nicholas Soussanin (born 16 January 1889, Yalta, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire (present-day Crimea, Ukraine) ‚Äì 27 April 1975, New York City, New York) was a Russian actor who settled and worked in the United States.

The weapon uses the .338 Norma Magnum round, giving it greater lethality and double the range of the 7.62 NATO round. The LWMMG has a rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute, an effective range of 1,700 meters (1,860 yards), and a maximum range of 5,642 meters (6,170 yards). It weighs 24 pounds (10.8 kg), making it only slightly heavier than the M240L, and lighter than the M240B. The .338NM bullet has over of muzzle energy and is four times more powerful than the 7.62 NATO at 1,000 meters. An individual round is twice as heavy (45.5 grams compared to 24 grams), as are each belt link (8 grams compared to 4 grams). For each weapon to fire for one minute, the standard LWMMG weighing plus a belt of 500 .338NM rounds would weigh , while an M240B weighting plus a belt of 800 7.62 NATO rounds would weigh . The LWMMG is operated by a gas-operated, long-stroke piston with a rotating bolt located under the barrel and fires from an open bolt. It uses ‚ÄúShort Recoil Impulse Averaging‚Äù technology, patented by General Dynamics and previously used on their XM806 machine gun, where the entire barrel, barrel extension, gas system, and bolt assembly recoil inside the outer housing. The LWMMG is equipped with a quick-change barrel, quad picatinny rails, collapsible stock, and can be used by dismounted troops or mounted on a platform.General Dynamics Unveils New Medium-caliber Machine Gun at Joint Armaments Conference in Seattle - General Dynamics Press Release, 15 May 2012.338 NM Lightweight Medium Machine Gun (LWMMG) - Thefirearmblog.com, 16 May 2012GD Lightweight Medium Machine Gun / LWMMG - World.Guns.ru The LWMMG is pitched as being a bridge between 7.62 NATO and .50 BMG machine guns. While the M240 has an effective range of 1,100 m, the LWMMG fires a .338 bullet that can provide effective and accurate fire out to 1,700 m. General Dynamics officials say their machine gun is not meant to be a replacement for the M240, but to give the ability to put effective fire on targets at extended ranges. The LWMMG can be mounted on an M240 mount and costs about the same. While the company is satisfied with the shorter .338NM cartridge's performance, the gun could easily be converted to .338 Lapua Magnum. The gun's short recoil operating system causes the barrel to reciprocate, similar to the M2 machine gun. This combined with a gas system to minimize recoil balances positive and negative recoil forces, allowing a gunner to fire a round with significantly greater energy but with the recoil profile similar to a 7.62 mm round from an M240.GD Shows Off Long-Range Machine Gun - Kitup.Military.com, 25 September 2013 ==History== General Dynamics first realized the capability gap being experienced by U.S. forces in Afghanistan around 2010. In many cases, troops were on low ground and being engaged by PKM machine gun fire from the high ground, forcing them to return fire from where they were instead of being able to seek a better position. The M2 .50-caliber machine gun is too heavy for use by dismounted patrols, and rounds from an M240 begin to drift off-target at 800 meters, especially when shooting upwards. At closer ranges, an M240 is accurate but does not have enough penetrating power against hard structures. The Precision Sniper Rifle competition going on at that time also showed the U.S. military was interested in infantry weapons with a 1,500-meter range. To achieve desired range capabilities, the .338-caliber was chosen, specifically the .338 Norma Magnum over the .338 Lapua Magnum for several reasons including greater barrel life and a less tapered case for better use in a push-through design metallic disintegrating link. At , the 7.62 NATO's velocity drops to about ; at that range, the .338NM travels at and out to , the round is capable of defeating Level III armor. A machine gun was then designed around the concept with Short Recoil Impulse Averaging technology, uses available subsystem components to keep cost down, and has a broad view 6-power scope to enable point target engagement out to 1,000-1,200 meters. The development of prototypes was entirely company-funded and took 12 months. The LWMMG was first unveiled on 15 May 2012 at the Joint Armaments Conference in Seattle, Washington.General Dynamics‚Äô New General Purpose Machine Gun in .338 Norma Magnum Effective to 1800 Yards - Guns.com, 16 May 2012Revolutionary Lightweight Machine Gun Prototype Unveiled by GDATP - Defensemedianetwork.com, 24 May 2012 An improved LWMMG was displayed at AUSA 2014 with its weight decreased to . Previously, the gun underwent a firing demonstration with special operations elements at Camp Roberts, California. When firing from a bipod, the gunners were able to fire directly and hit targets as far out as . At that range, a .50 caliber machine gun is designed to be an area weapon and could only fire accurately with single shots, while the LWMMG can maintain accurate automatic fire beyond what the .50 Cal is capable of. This showed the weapon's significance of hitting targets at longer ranges than what an M240 can do that would require the use of a vehicle-mounted .50 caliber weapon.

It was the first World Federalist Organization in the 20th century. In 1937, disenchanted with the League of Nations and its perceived weaknesses, they announced the Campaign's mission to promote a federal world government directly representing the interests of the world's people, as opposed to the interests of states.https://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/cwg.pdf While the specific methods promoted for achieving this goal shifted over the next several decades, the Campaign adhered to the concept of a populist global federalism throughout its existence. The Campaign's early platform was outlined in 1937 in their pamphlet \\"Chaos, War or a New World Order?\\" which called for the creation of a World Constitutional Convention. At this convention, it was hoped, a framework for a Federation of Nations would be formed, and democratic elections to the federation would be scheduled. Schwimmer and Lloyd included a tentative plan for this novel federal body, including full membership for all countries, direct representation, and several organs of government. Among the plan's elements were a new international date system, the abolition of all military bodies, the peaceful transfer of people out of population-dense regions, and a combined global free-trade and command economy. Over time, as Schwimmer and Lloyd recognized the increasing unlikelihood of national governments voluntarily forming a world government, their plan shifted emphasis to the peaceful popular demand for the election of such a body. Following this shift, the Campaign began to focus on national consciousness-raising and international conferences of other like-minded groups. ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1937 Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States Category:World federalist movement member organizations Category:World government ","title":"Campaign for World Government"},{"id":"35841986","text":"Joseph J. O'Donnell Field is a baseball venue in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is home to the Harvard Crimson baseball team of Harvard University. Formerly known as Soldier's Field, the location has been home to Harvard baseball since 1898. The venue is named for Joseph J. O'Donnell, a Harvard alumnus who played baseball and football while attending the school. It has a capacity of 1,600 spectators. == History  Donation and dedication === The land on which O'Donnell sits was donated to Harvard in 1890 by Major Henry Lee Higginson; Higginson named the site Soldier's Field after six of his friends who died fighting in the Civil War‚Äì James Savage, Jr., Charles Russell Lowell, Edward Barry Dalton, Stephen George Perkins, James Jackson Lowell, Robert Gould Shaw. At the site's dedication, Higginson said in an address to Harvard's students: :This field means more than a playground to me, for I ask to make it a memorial to some dear friends who gave their lives, and all that they had or hoped for, to their country and to their fellow men in the hour of great need‚Äîthe War of the Rebellion. They gave their lives in the cause of virtue and good government, and to save our nation from the great sins of disunion and of slavery. This is what we claim for our northern men. === Use === The Harvard baseball program moved to the location in 1898; from 1884‚Äì1897, it had played at Holmes Field, which Harvard also used for football games and track and field competitions. The Harvard Crimson football and track and field teams continued to share Soldier's Field until moving to Harvard Stadium. On April 27, 1898, in the first game played on the field, Harvard defeated Dartmouth 13‚Äì7. Prior to a doubleheader against Dartmouth on May 4, 1997, the field was dedicated to Joseph J. O'Donnell, Harvard class of 1967. O'Donnell played baseball and football at Harvard, captaining the baseball team during his senior season. He donated $2.5 million to the baseball program in 1995, allowing it to hire a head coach on a full-time basis. In 2012, O'Donnell donated an additional $30 million to the university. The 1998 Harvard team had a 15‚Äì0 record at O'Donnell Field and is the only team in program history to have an undefeated home record. == Features == The field features a natural grass surface, bullpens, and shrubbery beyond the outfield fence. Bleacher seating is located behind home plate and on the first base side of the field. In 2004, a new backstop and dugouts were added to the field. Additionally, the height of the outfield fence was raised from three feet to four feet. Harvard Stadium stands next to the field on the first base side. == Other uses == The field has hosted the baseball tournament of the summer Bay State Games on several occasions. It also hosts high school baseball showcases. == See also == * List of NCAA Division I baseball venues ==References== Category:College baseball venues in the United States Category:College football venues Category:Harvard Crimson baseball Category:Harvard Crimson football Category:American football venues in Boston Category:Baseball venues in Massachusetts Category:1898 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Sports venues completed in 1898 ","title":"Joseph J.

Growing up a Quaker, Franklin Harris lived in Butler Township from the cradle. At age 22, two months after the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted in military service; after service in the 104th OVI, he served in the carpenter corps until being discharged in 1863.

He is known as one of the pioneers of nuclear physics in India and for building the nation's first cyclotron at the University of Calcutta. In the early 1970s, as the Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defence and chair of the Cabinet Committee on Science and Technology, Nagchaudhuri played an influential role in Smiling Buddha, India's first nuclear test. He also initiated the first feasibility studies on India's ballistic missile program. Later, he also served as a member of the Planning Commission and as Vice Chancellor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. ==Early life== Nagchaudhuri was born on 6 September 1917 in Barodi village of Dhaka district. His father U. C. Nag was a Professor of English at Dhaka University. He was the eldest of seven sons, one of whom died quite young. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the Banaras Hindu University. He obtained a Master's degree from Allahabad University. In Allahabad, he met influential lawyer Parmeshwar Narayan Haksar as well as renowned Indian physicist, Meghnad Saha. He became close to Saha and joined his research group. In July 1938, when Saha moved to the Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta, Nagchaudhuri moved with him. Through Saha, he came in contact with Ernest Lawrence and with the latter's support he moved to the University of California, Berkeley at the end of 1938 to work on his doctorate in Nuclear Physics. His thesis advisor was Ernest Lawrence. Nagchaudhuri completed his doctorate in 1941 and returned to India. After the partition of India in 1947 and the ensuing violence against Hindus in Dhaka, his family moved to India. His father took a position as a professor in the Department of English at the Banaras Hindu University. Nagchaudhuri was married to Dipali Nag n√©e Talukdar, daughter of a professor at St. Johns College, Agra. Dipali Nag was a well-known classical vocalist. They had one son. ==Professional workAcademics and research=== After completing his doctorate in 1941, Nagchaudhuri returned to the Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta to join Saha's research group. In 1949, when the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) was established, Nagchaudhuri was affiliated with research at the institute, while continuing to teach at Science College, Calcutta University. After Saha's retirement in 1952, he was named Director of the SINP. Nagchaudhuri's research focused on nuclear isomers, induced radioactivity, Cherenkov radiation and nonthermal plasma. During his doctorate at Berkeley, he had worked with the pioneers of the cyclotron. Before returning to India in 1941, with support from Saha and funding from the Tatas, Nagchaudhuri had arranged for shipment of parts for a cyclotron magnet to the Calcutta University. However, ship carrying the second consignment of parts for the cyclotron was sunk by the Japanese. The team under the leadership of Saha and later under Nagchaudhuri took on the task of building the remaining parts themselves. Problems with the vacuum pumps continued to afflict the project. The demountable oscillators also proved difficult to build. It was only in 1954, after a visit from Emilio Segre to the laboratory, that the cyclotron started to function. Nagchaudhuri is thus credited with building the first cyclotron in India. In 1953, he succeeded Meghnad Saha as the Palit Professor of Physics at Calcutta University, a post which he held until 1959. He was a visiting professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1961-62 and nominated as a Lincoln Lecturer. ===Government=== Being well-connected to the political elite of West Bengal through his relationship with B.C. Roy and with P.N. Haksar, Nagchaudhuri was nominated to serve as the Chairman of the Cabinet Committee of Science & Technology from 1969-72. During this period, he also served as the Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). He became a Member of the Planning Commission in 1970. From 1970-1974, he served as the Scientific Advisor to the DRDO. Given his background in nuclear physics, and in his roles as the chair of the cabinet committee and as scientific advisor to the DRDO, he was closely involved in the policy discussion about India's nuclear test. In October 1972, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave the go-ahead for the Smiling Buddha test. Nagchaudhuri was a member of the steering committee for the test preparations. It was in the scientific laboratories of the DRDO, headed by Nagchaudhuri, that the explosive lenses for the test were fabricated. The test was successfully conducted in May 1974. In 1970, he was also tasked by Indira Gandhi to prepare a classified feasibility study for building long-range ballistic missiles. Based on Nagchaudhuri's recommendation, Project Valiant was initiated in 1972 to build a liquid-fuelled intermediate range ballistic missile. Another initiative, Project Devil, was initiated at the Defense Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL) to produce short-range surface-to-air missiles. While both projects were terminated in 1974 due to conflicts within DRDL and resulting lack of progress, they laid the foundation for the successful Integrated Guided Missile Development Program in the early 1980s. In 1970-71, Nagchaudhuri also chaired a committee that examined India's maritime security issues. The committee made several key recommendations about the requirement to patrol India's vast coastline, set up a registry of offshore fishing vessels in order to identify illegal activity, and establish a capable and well-equipped force to intercept vessels engaged in illegal activities. The recommendations of the committee formed the foundation of the subsequent Rustamji Committee in 1974, that led to the establishment of the Indian Coast Guard. ===Later work=== From 1 July 1974 to 1 January 1979, he served as the Vice Chancellor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). From 1975-1977, he served as the Chairman of the National Committee on Environmental Planning and Coordination. He also served on the Board of Governors of the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. ==Affiliations== Nagchaudhuri served on numerous Indian and international scientific councils. From 1976-1984, he served a Member of the Scientific Council of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics. From 1980-1982 he served on the Research Advisory Council of the National Physical Laboratory. He also served as a member and vice-chair of the Board of Governors of the East-West Center. He also served on the boards of various Indian public sector companies. These included Bharat Dynamics Limited, Bharat Electronics Limited and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. He maintained an active interest in music and culture. He served on the advisory board of the ITC Sangeet Research Academy. ===Awards=== Nagchaudhuri was elected a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy in 1964. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1975. He also received honorary doctorates from Andhra University and the Kanpur University. ==Death== Nagchaudhuri died of a cerebral infarction on 25 June 2006. He was survived by his wife, Dipali Nag, his son and his family. ==References== Category:1917 births Category:2006 deaths Category:20th-century Indian physicists Category:Indian nuclear physicists Category:Banaras Hindu University alumni Category:University of Allahabad alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of Calcutta faculty Category:Recipients of the Padma Vibhushan in literature & education Category:People from Dhaka District Category:Bengali physicists ","title":"Basanti Dulal Nagchaudhuri"},{"id":"35842239","text":"The Tour of Limburg may refer to: * Ronde van Limburg (Belgium), a cycling race in Limburg, Belgium * Ronde van Limburg (Netherlands), a cycling race in South Limburg, Netherlands ","title":"Ronde van Limburg"},{"id":"35842245","text":"Nadezhda Filippova (born 1959) is a field hockey player and Olympic medalist.

Uterine sarcomas account for 3 to 9 % of uterine cancers, and 5.5 to 9 % of uterine sarcomas are adenosarcomas. The most common presenting symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Other symptoms include pelvic pain, abdominal mass, or vaginal discharge.McCluggage, Glenn W. ‚ÄúUterine Adenosarcoma.‚Äù Uterine Adenosarcoma, Department of Pathology, Royal Group of Hospitals Trust, Belfast, Northern Ireland, 2009, uscapknowledgehub.org/site~/98th/pdf/companion12h05.pdf. Uterine adenosarcoma commonly arise from the endometrium. Uterine adenosarcomas have the highest incidence in perimenopasual and postmenopausal women with a mean age of 50 years, but some incidence among children. Survival is better compared to other types of uterine sarcomas. The prognosis of uterine adenosarcoma depends on the stage and if sarcomatous overgrowth is present.Andre Pinto and Brooke Howitt (2016) Uterine Adenosarcoma. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine: March 2016, Vol. 140, No. 3, pp. 286-290. ===Risk Factors=== No definitive causes of adenosarcoma have been identified. Potential risk factors include a medical history of endometriosis and use of estrogen modulating agents such as tamoxifen. Other potential risk factors include previous pelvic irradiation and prolonged estrogen exposure Stern RC, Dash R, Bentley RC, Snyder MJ, Haney AF, Robboy SJ. Malignancy in endometriosis: frequency and comparison of ovarian and extraovarian types. Int J Gynecol Pathol. 2001;20(2):133‚Äì9. ===Treatment=== The standard care of treatment is total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy. Lymphadenectomy is usually not performed as the incidence of lymph node metastasis is rare. There is no standardized chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or radiation therapy.√ñzen √ñ. M√ºllerian adenosarcoma. PathologyOutlines.com website. http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/uterusadenosarcoma.html. Accessed March 20th, 2019Nathenson, M. J., Conley, A. P., Lin, H., Fleming, N., & Ravi, V. (2017). Treatment of recurrent or metastatic uterine adenosarcoma. Sarcoma, 2017. Because of the rarity of adenosarcoma, there is limited data to guide treatment decisions, particularly in regard to recurrent or metastatic tumors. Chemotherapy may be considered in patients with recurrence or tumors unable to be completely removed through surgery. It has been suggested that uterine adenosarcomas can respond to doxorubicin/ifosfamide and gemcitabine/docetaxel chemotherapy.M. J. Nathenson, V. Ravi, N. Fleming, W.-L. Wang, and A. Conley, ‚ÄúUterine adenosarcoma: a review,‚Äù Current Oncology Reports, vol. 18, no. 11, p. 68, 2016. The use of hormone therapy in recurrent or metastatic disease is limited to case reports. ===Recurrence and Survival=== Survival is influenced by the presence of myometrial invasion, sarcomatous overgrowth, lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, and the presence of heterologous elements, which are features in the tumor not native to the tissue of origin such as rhabdomyoblastic differentiation Post-operative recurrence is common in uterine adenosarcomas. Recurrence usually occurs in the vagina, pelvis, and abdomen, and is seen in up to 30% of cases resulting in a poor prognosis. The presence and depth of the sarcoma‚Äôs myometrial invasion determines early staging diagnosis. The FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) staging is IA: no myometrial invasion, IB: inner myometrial half, IC: outer myometrial half. If confined to the endometrium with no myometrial invasion (IA), the prognosis is good with 7-13% recurrence for noninvasive tumors. FIGO stage II or greater is considered advanced with overall survival of approximately 60% with myometrial invasion, but less than 50% if metastases are present. High grade adenosarcomas tend to have extrauterine spread and rapid recurrence. Adenosarcoma with myometrial invasion recurred in 36-46% of cases. Patients with sarcomatous overgrowth showed significantly increased risk of recurrence, around 70-77 %, a risk of metastases around 40%, and a decreased 5-year overall survival, 50 to 60 %. This is comparable to other high grade uterine sarcomas. ==Ovarian Adenosarcoma== Ovarian adenosarcoma is a very rare tumor effecting the ovaries. 97.5% of ovarian adenosarcomas are unilateral,Eichhorn JH, Young RH, Clement PB, Scully RE. Mesodermal (mullerian) adenosarcoma of the ovary: a clinicopathologic analysis of 40 cases and a review of the literature. Am J Surg Pathol. 2002;26(10):1243‚Äì58. affecting only one ovary. It mainly affects women of reproductive age 30-84, with a mean age of 54. Symptoms of ovarian adenosarcoma include abdominal or pelvic pain and abdominal swelling. Tumor may present as adnexal mass.Gupta N M√ºllerian adenosarcoma. PathologyOutlines.com website. http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/ovarytumormullerianadeno.html. Accessed March 25th, 2019. ===Risk Factors=== Most of the cases reported have associated endometriosis or an adenosarcoma arising from an endometriotic area, but the direct relation between this tumor and endometriosis has not been made clear in the literature.Shakuntala, P. N., Umadevi, K., Usha, A., Abhilasha, N., & Bafna, U. D. (2012). Primary ovarian adenosarcoma with elevated Ca-125 levels and normal ascitic fluid cytology: a case report and review of literature. ecancermedicalscience, 6. ===Treatment=== Typically, ovarian adenosarcomas are surgically removed via salphingopherectomy or panhysterectomy. 67% of patients had tumor rupture at or before excision. There is no standardized chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or radiation therapy due to limited data. ===Recurrence and Survival=== Ovarian adenosarcomas have a worse prognosis than uterine adenosarcomas, presumably because of the greater ease of peritoneal spread. Many of these ovarian tumors have caused problems in differential diagnosis. Advanced stage ovarian adenosarcoma is characterized by extraovarian spreading, sarcomatous overgrowth, and tumor rupture. The presence of sarcomtous overgrowth is associated with increased risk of recurrence or extraovarian spreading. Recurrence poses more of a threat than metastases, which appear to be less prevalent. 5 year survival is 64%, 10 year survival is 46%. ==Cervical Adenosarcoma== Cervical adenosarcoma is an extremely rare tumor that occurs most often in women of reproductive age. Typically, adenosarcoma found in the cervix is a result of extrauterine spreading of the tumor, though adenosarcoma can arise in the cervix. Symptoms of cervical adenosarcoma, like uterine adenosarcoma, are characterized by abnormal bleeding.Jones, M. W., & Lefkowitz, M. (1995). Adenosarcoma of the uterine cervix: a clinicopathological study of 12 cases. International journal of gynecological pathology: official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists, 14(3), 223-229. Treatment mainly consists of total abdominal hysterectomy, occasionally with additional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Prognosis of cervical adenosarcoma is usually favorable, with metastasis and recurrence of the tumor being less common. As with uterine adenosarcoma, the depth of myometrial invasion determines the prognosis, with deeper invasion being associated with metastases and tumor recurrence. ==See also== *Sarcoma ==References== Category:Types of cancer ","title":"Adenosarcoma"},{"id":"35842378","text":"Myrtle Grove Plantation, also known as the Old Bass Place, is a plantation in Waterproof, Louisiana.

Ahlers began her career at the age of four, appearing as a dancer in circus acts. At seven she studied at the Operatic School of Dancing in Hamburg. Her breakthrough role was in the operetta Casanova, composed by Ralph Benatzky. This role established her popularity in Berlin. In December 1931, she appeared with Richard Tauber in an operetta by Erich Wolfgang Korngold at the Admiralspalast in Berlin. This was called 'Das Lied der Liebe' and was based on the Johann Strauss operetta Das Spitzentuch der K√∂nigin. [ref: Daniel O'Hara, Richard Tauber: A new Chronology, Saltburn, 2013]. This ran until March 1932, after which she went to London, England to appear with Heddle Nash in the operetta The Dubarry at Her Majesty's Theatre [Ref: Eleanor Allen, Heddle Nash: Singing against the Tide, Jubilee House, London, 2010. On 14 March 1933, while appearing in London, she died in controversial circumstances after jumping out her flat window in an apparent suicide. Her death has been blamed both on morphine that she had taken while suffering from tuberculosis, and on sleeping pills she was taking due to insomnia. ==Filmography== *Casanova (1928) *Madame Pompadour (1931) - Die Marquise von Pompadour *' (1931) - Alexandra *The True Jacob (1931) - Yvette *Kabarett-Programm Nr. 5 (1931, short) *Die Liebesfiliale (1931) - Madame Irene *The Company's in Love (1932) - Peggy Barling ==External links== * * * Portrait by Laszlo ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Actresses from Hamburg Category:German film actresses Category:German female singers Category:20th- century German actresses Category:Suicides by jumping in England Category:20th-century German singers Category:Burials at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery Category:20th-century women singers ","title":"Anny Ahlers"},{"id":"35842617","text":"Panagiotes the Protopsaltes or Panagiotes the New Chrysaphes (; c. 1622 ‚Äì 1682) was a Greek composer, protopsaltes (first cantor) and poet in Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. == Life and work == He served as protopsaltes of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (about 1655 to 1682) and like the former protopsaltes Theophanes Karykes he became engaged in a revival of the Byzantine psaltic art or art of chant. As student of the patriarchal protopsaltes Georgios Raidestinos, his approach was based on the recomposition of the late medieval sticherarion as it was described by Manuel Chrysaphes in his treatise about psaltic art,About the reception history of Manuel Chrysaphes, see Antonopoulos (2013, pp. 161-163). An example can be studied in the discussion of the sticheraric melos during the 19th century and the transcription of the New Method by Chourmouzios the Archivist (Neobyzantine Octoechos). and the recomposition of the Byzantine Anastasimatarion was based on the simple psalmody according to the Octoechos.

It is the capital of the Comarca of Li√©bana and is located in the centre of it. It is bordered to the north by Cillorigo de Li√©bana, to the west by Camale√±o, to the south by Vega de Li√©bana and to the east by Cabez√≥n de Li√©bana. ==Geography== River Quiviesa, through San Cayetano bridge The town of Potes is located at the confluence of four valleys, near where the River Quiviesa flows in the River Deva, the latter born at altitudes of the Picos de Europa. Like the rest of the Li√©bana region, Potes enjoys a Mediterranean microclimate that allows the cultivation of the vines, walnut and poplar. Overlooking the town is Arabedes mountain (694m). ==History== Potes is located in a strategic location: at the point where the two rivers of Li√©bana meet: the Deva and its tributary the Quiviesa. There is little trace of prehistoric occupation in the region, but the Romans knew the power of strategic site and named it Pontes. A village was founded in the 8th century under Alfonso I of Asturias. Potes appeared for the first time in a document written in 847; the document mentions the parish church and the town. Later in the 10th century, thanks to its booming economy, Potes became the administrative centre of the Comarca of Li√©bana. Potes was considered a city from the 13th century and received royal recognition. In the Becerro de Behetr√≠as manuscript (1351), it appears as the property of Tello Alfonso, son of Alfonso XI of Castile. During the late Middle Ages, like all of Li√©bana, the town was involved in the confrontation between the families of Manrique Casta√±eda and Mendoza. In 1444, John II of Castile resolved the issue in favour of the Marquis of Santillana. The Marquis made Potes the capital of Liebana, and erected a large tower, called the Torre del Infantada. In this same period, prominent buildings such as the nearby Tower of Orej√≥n de la Lama and the San Cayetano bridge were built. In the modern age, Potes remained a place of manorialism. The Duke of Infantado appointed its mayor. Many villagers emigrated to America and the riches of the new continent allowed the construction of notable buildings in the village. In 1822, Potes received its own town council, being head of a judicial district covering Potes, Castro and Cillorigo, Cabez√≥n de Li√©bana, Camale√±o, Espinama, Pesaguero, Tresviso and Vega de Li√©bana. Thirty years later, it became part of the judicial district of San Vicente de la Barquera. During the Spanish Civil War, Potes was hit by a fire caused by the Republican side that destroyed the old town, it was rebuilt afterwards. The old town was classified as a Conjunto Hist√≥rico in 1983. ==Economy and infrastructure== The main source of income is from tourism due to its location in the Picos de Europa. Potes is on the national road N-621. The nearest major town, Santander, is 100 km away. ==Sites and monuments== Torre de Orej√≥n de la Lama *The old town, a historical monument, is a maze of alleys and steps with a medieval atmosphere. *It is dominated by the Torre del Infantado, a symbol of Potes, built in the 15th century. It has four floors and forms an imposing stone cube, only relieved by turrets. The tower now houses the City Council. *The old gothic church of San Vicente was built in 15th century and rebuilt from the late 15th century to 17th century, it was replaced in the 19th century by the new parish church of San Vicente. This has 18th-century altarpieces from the Convent of San Raimundo and a sculpture of Saint Vincent, patron saint of the city. In the square is a monument to the violinist Jes√∫s de Monasterio who was a native of Potes. *The nearby Bridge of San Cayetano overlooks the Rio Quiviesa since the 13th century. At one end is the Ermita de San Cayetano, a chapel which retains its wooden doors and an altarpiece of the 18th century with a portrait of San Cayetano and the Torre de Orej√≥n de la Lama, built from the 15th century to the 17th century and has on its front the shields of Celis and Bedoya. It now serves as a centre for exhibitions and cultural events. *Other houses, the Casona de la Canal (18th century), the Torre de la Familia Osorio (17th century) and the 18th century San Marcial Street, bears the arms of the family Campillo and birthplace of Jesus Monasterio, dating from the same period. *The Ermita de la Virgen del Camino is a chapel of the 18th century in the district of la Serna, it has an altarpiece of the same century. The Convent of San Raimundo was built in the early 17th century by the Benedictines. It remains today as the cloister which houses an exhibition on the Picos de Europa and Comarca of Li√©bana. *The Ermita de la Virgen de Valmayor, located outside the village, on the road to Vega de Liebana is a chapel built in the 16th century.

It is a fictionalised account of the life of the philosopher Hypatia, and tells the story of a young monk called Philammon who travels to Alexandria, where he becomes mixed up in the political and religious battles of the day. Intended as Christian apologia it reflects typical 19th-century religious sentiments of the day. For many years the book was considered one of Kingsley's best novels and was widely read. ==Plot== The plot revolves around Hypatia the pagan philosopher; Cyril the Christian patriarch; Orestes the power-hungry prefect of Egypt; and Philammon an Egyptian monk.Maria Dzielska, (1995), Hypatia of Alexandria, pages 8‚Äì11. Harvard University Press. Philammon travels from his monastic community in the desert to Alexandria,Simon Goldhill, (2011), Victorian Culture and Classical Antiquity, pages 203‚Äì5. Princeton University Press. and expresses a desire to attend Hypatia's lectures despite Cyril's dislike of Hypatia. Although Hypatia has a deep-seated hatred of Christianity, Philammon becomes her devoted friend and disciple. Philammon also encounters Pelagia, his long-lost sister, a former singer and dancer who is now married to a Gothic warrior. Philammon naturally desires to convert both women to Christianity. The plot is played out against the backdrop of Orestes' scheming to become emperor of Egypt and Africa; he uses Hypatia as a pawn. A subplot involves Raphael Aben-Ezra, a wealthy Jewish associate of Hypatia who falls in love with a Christian girl called Victoria and converts to win her love. A series of events, some of which are orchestrated by a Jewish woman called Miriam, raise tensions between the prefect and the church. Hypatia undergoes a spiritual crisis and comes close to being converted to Christianity by Raphael. Before this can happen, however, rumours are spread that Hypatia is the cause of unrest in the city and she is murdered by a Christian mob. Philammon, despondent, returns to the desert where he eventually becomes abbot of his monastery, albeit with a more worldly view of Christianity.Jess Nevins, (2005), The encyclopedia of fantastic victoriana, page 7. MonkeyBrain Books. ==Themes== Hypatia has a strong anti-Catholic tone which reflects Kingsley's own dislike of priests and monks. Kingsley's portrayal of a fractious and corrupt early Church represented by Cyril and the clergy is intended to reflect the 19th-century Catholic church. Kingsley also disliked priestly celibacy, and makes it clear that, in his view, it damages those who practise it. He was, nevertheless, keen to assert the moral superiority of Christianity over Judaism: of the two Jewish characters in the novel, one ‚Äì Miriam ‚Äì is consistently malevolent, and the other ‚Äì Raphael ‚Äì abandons his home to become a disillusioned wandering Jew before converting to Christianity. The portrayal of Greco-Roman paganism in the novel is likewise negative: thus when Orestes attempts a pagan revival in Alexandria, he does so by restoring the spectacle and butchery of the gladiatorial arena. Kingsley also devotes parts of the novel to expounding Neoplatonism and explaining its apparent flaws. Kingsley expresses a view of the superiority of northern Europeans in his portrayal of the Goths in Alexandria as saviours of Christianity, who, although crude and violent, possess the necessary Teutonic values of hardiness and virility to counter the corrupt church. This reflects a theme which Kingsley would later expound in a book and lecture series entitled The Roman and the Teuton.The Roman and the Teuton by Charles Kingsley at Project Gutenberg A further theme is the way Kingsley links religious insight with eroticism, a theme which is most overtly displayed in the climax of the novel with Hypatia stripped naked, being torn apart by monks under an enormous image of Christ.Patrick Brantlinger, William Thesing, (2008), A Companion to the Victorian Novel, page 253 John Wiley & Sons ==Publication== Hypatia at the feet of Philammon. Drawn by Lee Woodward Zeigler, 1899 Hypatia was originally serialised in 1852 in Fraser's Magazine from January 1852 to April 1853, and it was then published in book form in 1853.

The book was said to have been Queen Victoria's favourite novel by Kingsley.David Anthony Downes, (1972), The Temper of Victorian Belief: Studies in the Religious Novels of Pater, Kingsley and Newman, page 65. Ardent Pelagia and Philammon by Arthur Hacker The novel notably inspired the painting Hypatia by Charles William Mitchell (1885, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle) which depicts Hypatia, naked, cowering against an altar, facing her (unseen) murderers.Michael A. B. Deakin, (2007), Hypatia of Alexandria: mathematician and martyr, page 163. Prometheus Books Another painting inspired by the novel was Arthur Hacker's Pelagia and Philammon (1887, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) which depicts a naked Pelagia dying, watched by a cloaked, hooded Philammon.Jeffrey Richards, (2009), The ancient world on the Victorian and Edwardian stage, page 171. Palgrave Macmillan In Kingsley's era criticism of the novel was directed at his negative portrayal of the church in Alexandria and of Cyril in particular. It was this aspect of the novel, as well as its alleged indecency, which thwarted an attempt to bestow an honorary degree at Oxford University on Kingsley in 1863.Mary Virginia Brackett, Victoria Gaydosik, (2006), Companion to the British Novel, 18th and 19th Centuries, page 216 In addition, some readers were disappointed that Kingsley did not go further in villainising all creeds other than Christianity. The anti-Catholic theme of the novel naturally drew criticism from Catholic churchmen, and among the literary responses were novels by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, Fabiola (1854), and John Henry Newman, Callista (1855).Philip Davis, (2004), The Victorians: 1830‚Äì1880, page 293 In the modern era criticism of the novel has focused on its anti-Semitism as well as its racial prejudice. The book has been described as \\"ferociously racist\\".Margaret Drabble, (1998), The Oxford companion to English literature, page 465. Oxford University Press One review describes it as \\"Christian apologia, [with] religious and ethnic bigotry in the form of anti-Semitism and anti-Catholicism\\", but nevertheless concludes that \\"it is an unexpectedly involving novel, and is well worth searching out.\\" Another review criticises the novel for being \\"difficult to follow with the myriad of unnecessary characters and their convoluted esoteric arguments\\", but concludes that \\"Hypatia stands as an excellent example of fiction written for a specific purpose, as well as an impeccably researched novel that remains true to history.\\" ==Adaptations== Scene from G.

University of Michigan A more notable adaptation of the novel to the stage was G. Stuart Ogilvie's Hypatia, which opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London on 2 January 1893. It was produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Julia Neilson played the character of Hypatia, and her husband Fred Terry played Philammon. The play featured an elaborate musical score written by the composer Hubert Parry.Walter Macqueen-Pope, (1948), Haymarket: theatre of perfection, page 337. AllenWilliam Archer, (1969), The theatrical 'world' for 1893, page 9. B. Blom Ogilvie's play introduced a scheming Jewish character called Issachar (played by Tree) in place of Kingsley's Miriam. The portrayal of Issachar was relatively sympathetic, as Tree had great respect for the Jewish contribution to contemporary theatre.Nineteenth century theatre: NCT. (1993), Volumes 21‚Äì22, page 24. University of London Even The Jewish Chronicle noted that Issachar is \\"ambitious and able, he plots and counterplots but there is no suspicion or meanness in his nature\\" and concluded that he was the \\"least conventional and least offensive of recent stage Jews\\". ==References * Category:1853 British novels Category:Christian novels Category:British novels adapted into plays Category:Novels by Charles Kingsley Category:Novels set in ancient Rome Category:Novels set in ancient Egypt Category:Novels set in the 4th century Category:Gladiatorial combat in fiction Category:Cultural depictions of Hypatia Category:Novels first published in serial form ","title":"Hypatia (novel)"},{"id":"35842958","text":"America's Four Gods: What We Say About God -- & What That Says About Us is a book published in 2010, written by Baylor University professors Paul Froese and Christopher Bader. The book was based on a 2005 survey of religious views, which suggested that Americans' conceptions of God fall into four different classes. Further, they report, American's views on political, moral and scientific issues are usually tied to their conception of God. The four different conceptions of God described in the book are the 'authoritative', 'benevolent', 'critical' and 'distant' God. Individuals who conceive of an authoritative God and a benevolent God both see God as taking an interventionist role in believers' lives. They differ, however, in how they see God intervening. Those who conceive of an authoritative God imagine God intervenes to punish those who lapse from his rules, and are likely to be white males. Those who conceive of a benevolent God imagine God intervenes to rescue and present alternatives, and are likely to be female. Individuals who conceive of a critical God imagine he does not intervene in individuals lives, but will judge them in an afterlife. Statistically black Americans are more likely to hold this conception. Those who believe in a distant God imagine that God set the entire Universe in motion, but has no engagement with humanity at all. Americans who hold this conception are statistically likely to have completed more years of education than those in the other three groups. In summary: { ! Conception of God !! Perceived role of God !! Typical believer - ! Authoritative  God intervenes to punish those who violate his rules  White males - ! Benevolent  God intervenes to rescue and offer options  Females - ! Critical  God does not intervene in lives, but judges in afterlife  Black Americans - ! Distant  God created Universe but does not engage with mankind  More educated } Father Patrick J. Howell, a Jesuit writing in The Seattle Times, noted that the four conceptions of God were represented by followers of Judaism, Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam.

Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., cusk-eel and snailfish).

Brachycephalic syndrome is a pathological condition affecting short nosed dogs and cats which can lead to severe respiratory distress. There are four different anatomical abnormalities that contribute to the disease, all of which occur more commonly in brachycephalic breeds:- an elongated soft palate, stenotic nares, a hypoplastic trachea, and everted laryngeal saccules (a condition which occurs secondary to the other abnormalities). Because all of these components make it more difficult to breathe, in situations of exercise, stress, or heat, an animal with these abnormalities may be unable to take deep or fast enough breaths to blow off carbon dioxide. This leads to distress and further increases respiratory rate and heart rate, creating a vicious cycle that can quickly lead to a life- threatening situation. Brachycephalic dogs are more likely to die during air travel and have been banned by many airlines. Dogs experiencing a crisis situation due to brachycephalic syndrome typically benefit from oxygen, cool temperatures, sedatives, and in some cases more advanced medical intervention, including intubation. == Causes and risk factors == This diagram illustrates what the airway structure looks like in a brachycephalic dog; in this case, a Boxer. * * * 1. Nasal cavity 2. Oral cavity 3. Soft palate 4. Pharynx 5. Larynx 6. Trachea 7. Esophagus 8. Nasopharynx 9. Hard palate * * * The brachycephalic dog has a shorter snout which causes the airway to be shorter, that means all the parts that make up the airway get pushed closer together. Due to this phenomenon, a brachycephalic dog has an elongated soft palate which can cause most of the problems with the dogs breathing. They can also have problems getting enough air in because of their elongated soft palate and shorter airway. *Stenotic nares (narrowed nostril) *Elongated soft palate *Hypoplastic trachea (reduced trachea size) *Short/irregular nasal turbinate Muzzle length scales with the risks of brachycephalic syndrome. Other risk factors identified include neck girth and body condition score. == Signs and symptoms == *Dyspnea (breathing difficulty) **Noisy/labored breathing **Stridor (high pitched wheezing) **Continued open-mouth breathing **Extending of head and neck to keep airway open **Sitting up or keeping chin in an elevated position when sleeping **Sleeping with toy between teeth to keep mouth open to compensate for nasal obstruction **Cyanosis (blue/purple discoloration of the skin, due to poor blood oxygenation in the lungs ) **Sleep apnea *Stress and heat intolerance during exercise. *Snoring/gagging/choking/regurgitation/vomiting *Collapse Symptoms progress with age and typically become severe by 12 months. Despite observing clinical signs of airway obstructions, some owners of brachycephalic breeds may perceive them as normal for the breed, and may not seek veterinary intervention until a particularly severe attack happens. After awaking from surgery, most dogs that are intubated will try to claw out their tracheal tube. In contrast, brachycephalic dogs often seem quite happy to leave it in place as it opens the airway, making it easier to breathe. ===Secondary conditions=== Other conditions may be observed concurrently. These include swollen/everted laryngeal saccules, which further reduce the airway, collapsed larynx, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by the increased lung workload. Brachycephalic syndrome has been linked to changes in the lungs, as well as the gastrointestinal tract including bronchial collapse, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic gastritis. == Diagnosis == This syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of the dog's breed, clinical signs, and results of a physical examination by a veterinarian. Stenotic nares can usually be diagnosed on visual inspection. Diagnosis of an elongated soft palate, everted laryngeal saccules, or other associated anatomical changes in the mouth will require heavy sedation or full general anesthesia. == Treatment == Treatment consists of surgery for widening the nostrils, removing the excess tissue of an elongated soft palate, or removing everted laryngeal saccules. Early treatment prevents secondary conditions from developing. Potential complications include hemorrhages, pain, and inflammation during and after surgery. Some veterinarians are hesitant to perform soft palate correction surgery. With CO2 surgical lasers, these complications are greatly diminished. == Prevention == To prevent or limit exacerbation of symptoms, avoid stress and high heated climates. Maintain ideal body weight and avoid overfeeding. Use harnesses instead of collars to avoid pressure on the trachea. The risk of brachycephalic syndrome increases as the muzzle becomes shorter. To avoid producing affected dogs, breeders may choose to breed for more moderate features rather than for extremely short or flat faces. Dogs with breathing difficulties, or at least those serious enough to require surgery, should not be used for breeding. Removing all affected animals from the breeding pool may cause some breeds to be unsustainable and outcrossing to non-brachycephalic breeds might be necessary. ==Other health problems== Non-airway problems associated with brachycephalia may include *Inflammation in skin folds *Mating and birthing problems *Malocclusion - misalignment of the teeth. *Dental crowding Exophthalmos in a pug *Brachycephalic ocular syndrome **Ectropion/entropion - inward/outward rolling of eyelid **Macropalpebral fissure **Lagophthalmia - inability to close eyelids fully **Exophthalmos/eye proptosis - abnormal protrusion of the eye **Nasal fold trichiasis - fur around the nose fold rubs against the eye. **Distichiasis - abnormally placed eyelashes rubs against the eye. **Poor tear production. **Gastrointestinal problems ==List of brachycephalic dog breeds== Boxer, have less compromised thermoregulation and thus are more tolerant of vigorous exercise and heat. * Affenpinscher * American Bulldog * Boston Terrier * Boxer * Bulldog * Bullmastiff * Cane Corso * Chihuahua (apple-headed) *Chow Chow * Dogue de Bordeaux * English Mastiff * French Bulldog * Griffon Bruxellois * Japanese Chin * King Charles Spaniel * Lhasa Apso * Neapolitan Mastiff * Pekingese * Pug * Rottweiler * Shih Tzu * Valley Bulldog == References == Category:Dog diseases Category:Syndromes in animals ","title":"Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome"},{"id":"35843180","text":"Latrodectus curacaviensis is a species of black widow spider, that belongs to the genus Latrodectus. It is known as the South American black widow, Brazilian black widow or Ara√±a del trigo. == Description == Like many black widow species, females are larger than males, growing up to 11-17 mm, with their body and legs black and red. Males are much smaller, known by their long legs, and white or brown color. Latrodectus curacaviensis is mainly nocturnal. It is not aggressive to humans, but females will attack to defend their egg sacs. It feeds on small insects.https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/lhd/venomous_animals_byspecies.pdf They have a distinct hourglass mark with a black diamond shape and four red triangles in a square. Bites are rare but dangerous. == Distribution and habitat == It has been reported in the Lesser Antilles and South America. It is usually found under logs, in sheds, stone fireplaces, near trash and debris. == Venom == The venom contains excitatory neurotoxins (alpha- latrotoxins). Bites usually deliver only small amounts of venom, which may result in dangerous symptoms mostly in children, old people and people with cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Reported symptoms include intense local pain. Systemic symptoms include sweating, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, eyelids swelling, salivation, rigid and painful abdominal muscles, nausea, vomits and impaired sight. In a case that occurred in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, other symptoms were reported, such as muscle spasms, fever, chills and intense sweating ‚Äì common symptoms of latrodectism, There are some reports of priapism.https://www.scielo.br/pdf/rsbmt/v31n1/0620.pdf The average venom yield is 0.60 mg, and the maximum is 1.30 mg, the lethal dose is 0.170 mg by intravenous injection and 0.240 mg by subcutaneous injection. ==References== curacaviensis Category:Spiders of South America Category:Spiders described in 1776 ","title":"Latrodectus curacaviensis"},{"id":"35843238","text":"Jahangir Butt (born 17 April 1943) is a Pakistani field hockey player.

One motivation of the study of active matter by physicists is the rich phenomenology associated to this field. Collective motion and swarming are among the most studied phenomena. Within the huge number of models that have been developed to catch such behavior from a microscopic description, the most famous is the model introduced by Tam√°s Vicsek et al. in 1995. Physicists have a great interest in this model as it is minimal and describes a kind of universality. It consists in point-like self-propelled particles that evolve at constant speed and align their velocity with their neighbours' one in presence of noise. Such a model shows collective motion at high density of particles or low noise on the alignment. == Model (mathematical description) == As this model aims at being minimal, it assumes that flocking is due to the combination of any kind of self propulsion and of effective alignment. An individual i is described by its position \\\\mathbf{r}_i(t) and the angle defining the direction of its velocity \\\\Theta_i(t) at time t. The discrete time evolution of one particle is set by two equations: at each time step \\\\Delta t, each agent aligns with its neighbours at a distance r with an uncertainty due to a noise \\\\eta_i(t) such as \\\\Theta_i(t+\\\\Delta t) = \\\\langle \\\\Theta_j \\\\rangle_{r_i-r_j and moves at constant speed v in the new direction: \\\\mathbf{r}_i(t+\\\\Delta t) = \\\\mathbf{r}_i(t) + v \\\\Delta t \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\Theta_i(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\Theta_i(t) \\\\end{pmatrix} The whole model is controlled by three parameters: the density of particles, the amplitude of the noise on the alignment and the ratio of the travel distance v \\\\Delta t to the interaction range r . From these two simple iteration rules, various continuous theories have been elaborated such as the Toner Tu theory which describes the system at the hydrodynamic level. An Enskog-like kinetic theory, which is valid at arbitrary particle density, has been developed. This theory quantitatively describes the formation of steep density waves, also called invasion waves, near the transition to collective motion. == Phenomenology == This model shows a phase transition from a disordered motion to large-scale ordered motion. At large noise or low density, particles are on average not aligned, and they can be described as a disordered gas. At low noise and large density, particles are globally aligned and move in the same direction (collective motion). This state is interpreted as an ordered liquid. The transition between these two phases is not continuous, indeed the phase diagram of the system exhibits a first order phase transition with a microphase separation. In the co-existence region, finite-size liquid bands emerge in a gas environment and move along their transverse direction. This spontaneous organization of particles epitomizes collective motion. == Extensions == Since its appearance in 1995 this model has been very popular within the physics community; many scientists have worked on and extended it. For example, one can extract several universality classes from simple symmetry arguments concerning the motion of the particles and their alignment. Moreover, in real systems, many parameters can be included in order to give a more realistic description, for example attraction and repulsion between agents (finite-size particles), chemotaxis (biological systems), memory, non- identical particles, the surrounding liquid. A simpler theory, the Active Ising model, has been developed to facilitate the analysis of the Vicsek model. == References == Category:Multi-agent systems ","title":"Vicsek model"},{"id":"35843312","text":"Cedric Demiko Goodman (born March 17, 1986) is an American sprinter who specializes in the 200 meters and 400 metres.

His mother, Ir√©n Budai, was a librarian and his father, Zolt√°n Perj√©s, an agricultural consultant. He grew up as an only child in Kony√°r until the age of 12, when he moved with his family to Debrecen. Encouraged by his father, a formerly amateur sports man, P√©ter began practising sports at school becoming an athlete with a discrete success at a national level from 1980 until 1986 in disciplines such as high jump, triple jump, 110 m. hurdles and decathlon. At the same time, he cultivated poetry. In 1987 he joined the army. There he had the chance to direct theatre, perform poems and learn how to play guitar giving an unexpected change to his career. After the army, he attended the College of Ny√≠regyh√°za getting a Geography and Physical Education Teaching Degree in 1992. As a singer and a songwriter he founded in 1990 the rock band August F√∂rster Reservation with his childhood friend, Akos Moldovan. The song \\"Mocskos √≥r√°k\\" (\\"Dirty hours\\") of their 1st album, \\"Valami m√°st\\" (\\"Something else\\"), was on the top of the music chart of a Hungarian national radio station's programme called Rock Gyermekei (Children of Rock) back in 1992.\\"F√°ra√≥ a zenekarvezet≈ë.

He also opened the Genius Caf√© in Debrecen, Hungary, (owner, 2000‚Äì2002) and the Key Bar in New York, United States of America (partner, from 2002). Meanwhile, he graduated from the New York Film Academy in the United States of America and from the Script-writing School of the National Film Production Agency in Hungary, both in 2002. The idea of his most ambitious project, the Casanova Night Musical, came in 2004 followed by nearly four years of rigorous creative art work from writing the libretto and the lyrics, through composing the music, to directing video clips and even designing the logo of the Casanova Night Musical from his family coat-of-arm. As the producer of the musical he founded Genius Production Ltd. in 2006 with the mission of spreading the idea of love through music and lifting the Casanova Night Musical to become the next musical hit of the musical genre.

He frames his wife and files for divorce, and Mildred ends up losing her daughter. Mildred moves into a cheap apartment and gradually becomes a Broadway showgirl and drowns her depression in a life of alcohol and jazz. Ted Willing (Forbes), a wealthy man, becomes her devoted admirer, but after her experience with her ex-husband, Mildred finds it hard to trust anyone. When Willing offers Mildred financial help, she refuses to accept anything, fearing that her daughter may hear about it. Eventually, she realizes that her daughter has completely forgotten about her and allows Willing to take care of her.

It was released on Gotee Records on July 10, 2012. House of Heroes entered Smoakstack Studios on December 12, 2011 in order to record Cold Hard Want. The band went with producer Paul Moak, who has produced artists such as Seabird, Lovedrug, Mat Kearney, after going with producer Mark Lee Townsend for the previous two albums. As of February 22, 2012, the record has been completely recorded and mastered. ==Release== On their Tumblr page, the band announced that the album would be out on July 10, 2012, and that they would release their first single, \\"Touch This Light\\", its music video, and a B-Side called \\"Dead\\" on April 24, 2012. On May 7, 2012, another song from the album, \\"Comfort Trap\\", was accidentally leaked by producer Paul Moak. The link was quickly pulled after only a handful of people were able to access the song., On May 15, 2012, five preorder bundles were made available on Gotee Records' online store, featuring limited edition CDs and vinyl presses. Every day from June 12, 2012 until June 22, 2012, the band updated http://coldhardwant.com to include a new song clip, and on some days, special downloads. These downloads included ringtones and handwritten guitar chords. Starting June 25 and ending July 6, the band once again updated the site every weekday, but this time with full lyric videos for each major song on the album (excluding the a capella intro and \\"outro\\"). On July 10, 2012, the album was made available digitally through iTunes, AmazonMP3, and Google Play, and in hard copy through major retailers such as Best Buy and Amazon. ==Critical reception== AllMusic's Chrysta Cherrie wrote that \\"Wrapping their messages in energized, empowering punk-pop and hard rock hooks, Cold Hard Want is as much a reflection of House of Heroes' overall sound and ethos as it is the natural next step in their evolution.\\" Alt Rock Live's Jonathan Faulkner wrote that \\"All in all this is a solid album all the way around by House of Heroes. Cold Hard Want will establish them as one of Christian Music's top bands and will defiantly draw in new fans.\\" CCM Magazine's Andy Argyrakis wrote that this album is \\"yet another notch and showcasing the vast musical spectrum that continues to flank the foursome.\\" CHRISTCORE's Brian Morrissette wrote that \\"The album isn't their best yet, but it is pretty darn good. It is in contention for album of the year, in my opinion. While I do miss the concept album design they have employed in the past, a straight-up record from them is nice.\\" Christian Music Zine's Megan Missler wrote that \\"If I had to sum up this album in one word it would be \\"raw.\\" The vocals, instrumentation, lyrics, emotion, feel, vibe, it's all raw...Cold Hard Want does not disappoint musically.\\" CM Addict's Kevin Thorson wrote that the album \\"is a flawless release.\\" Cross Rhythms' Gareth Hills wrote that \\"It's rare to find a band that are as creative lyrically as they are musically, and 'Cold Heart Want' shows that this band most definitely tick both of these boxes. Thoroughly recommended.\\" Decoy Music's Nick Senior wrote that \\"House of Heroes has certainly delivered with Cold Hard Want. In fact, the most significant complaint to be found on the album is the album title is a bit lame. However, the music and the passion these Ohioans exude on the album is anything but lame. Alternative rock may not need a group of heroes, but it may have found a candidate here.\\" Indie Vision Music's Josh Hamm wrote that \\"Cold Hard Want is another classic House of Heroes album that feels like an old favourite but still manages to show how their diversity and ability to create great music within their genre while experimenting and being true to themselves. The combination of top notch production, catchy melodies, beautiful harmonies, breathtaking musicianship and the amazing voice of Tim Skipper is more than enough to impress anyone from an old fan to a first time listener. This will stand as one of the best albums of 2012.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Josh Taylor wrote that \\"When it comes to a band like House of Heroes, with a discography as impressive as theirs, it is hard to give each new album a fair shake without comparing it to all of its predecessors. With that said, Cold Hard Want is, without a doubt, one of their two greatest pieces of work. Suburba was a great album in its own right, but this one feels like the true successor to The End Is Not the End. It takes all the best parts of Suburba, and brings back everything that made The End... the masterpiece that it was. Does this make Cold Hard Want their best work to date? Whether it is or not, that doesn't change the fact that this is the best album of 2012, hands down.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Kevin Chamberlin wrote that \\"House of Heroes is a diamond in the rough in Christian music. Often being underappreciated and overlooked, it begs the question as to why. Hopefully Cold Hard Want breaks them out of that cycle and garners the band the recognition for the musical beauty that this record is. Combining HOH nostalgia with heavier, edgier and more anthemic musical pieces, they may have set the bar higher than any of their previous records.\\" Louder Than the Music's Jono Davies wrote that \\"This band sounds like a mix between Muse and Switchfoot and fans of those bands will enjoy checking theses guys out. Cold Hard Want is a real rock kind of album with some great tunes that will leave the listener wanting more.\\" Muzik Dizcovery's Erik van Rheenen wrote that \\"If this was House of Heroes swing for alternative radio stardom, they just took a big swing and a miss at a pitch way outside the strike zone. Fans probably weren't looking for Suburba, Part 2, but for anyone who cracked a smile at House of Heroes boldly waving the goofy pop-rock banner, Cold Hard Want is a cold, hard disappointment.\\" New Release Tuesday's Kevin Davis wrote that \\"Cold Hard Want is House of Heroes' most urgent, most tangible, most undeniable artifact in their marked career. Hands down. Known for their creativity, House of Heroes has always taken pride in their ability to blend the experimental and the quirky into hooky, classic-rock-influenced anthems. But with Cold Hard Want, the band has taken the gloves off. Every song has an unavoidable, magnetic chorus. Every moment is desperate. Every track is modern rock, that is hopelessly candid‚Äîin the best possible way‚Äîcomplete with bombastic beats, shredding leads, and triumphant riffs. Make no mistake about one thing, however: House of Heroes has not placed their hopes on the fickle fortunes of rock n‚Äô roll. These four realize the fate of their souls cannot be hinged on something so mortal. Faith is‚Äîand always has been‚Äîthe crux of their creation.\\" New Release Tuesday's Jonathan Francesco wrote that \\"Now, the band offers Cold Hard Want, and as is the case with most bands who put out career-defining albums, it'll immediately be weighed against its predecessors. I feel it's unfair to stack everything the band does against their 'best' album. Cold Hard Want can stand on its own merits, even if it may not be the defining release of the band's career.\\" The NewReview's Jonathan Anderson wrote that \\"Time will tell if Cold Hard Want surpasses their previous efforts, but from where I‚Äôm standing, that is a distinct possibility.\\" Sputnikmusic's Davey Boy wrote that \\"Naturally, comparisons and rankings will still be made as to where 'Cold Hard Want' fits into the catalog of House of Heroes releases. Maybe more significant is the fact that it does indeed fit in nicely, since it feels like both a natural evolution for the band, as well as a summation of their career to date. In a sense, it somewhat mirrors the \\"living responsibly and conscientiously to die proudly\\" motif in that House of Heroes perform this album with such a passion, craft and proficiency, that no matter which direction they head next, this talented outfit will be able to look back upon 'Cold Hard Want' with nothing but pride.\\" == Track listing ChartsAlbum=== {  - !

The population as taken at the 2011 census can be found under Swynnerton. The village consists of mostly 1960s housing as well as the few remaining houses from the 19th century. Historically Tittensor forms part of Stone parish. The Tittensor family occupied a manor house which passed to the Gerrard family sometime before 1405. The house was destroyed and rebuilt several times over the centuries, and was finally demolished in 1834. Some of the materials were used to build St Luke's church in Tittensor which was constructed in 1880-81. The ruins of the manor house remained until they were finally demolished in the early 1960s. ==History== It was originally mentioned in the Domesday Book and became part of the Trentham Estate of the Duke of Sutherland in the nineteenth century. The village was enlarged in the 1960s by a private estate, providing the majority of the houses that stand there today, including council owned houses. In 2002 Tittensor has been expanded by a new development on the site of Groundslow Hospital, an old maternity hospital. Groundslow Villa was built in 1832 as a hunting lodge for the Duke of Sutherland when he lived at Trentham Park (the date can be seen on one of the walls) and in 1913 was sold and became a tuberculosis sanatorium as an annexe to the Staffordshire General Infirmary in Stafford. In 1956 it was still a tuberculosis sanatorium, with separate men's and women's wards. In later years, certainly by 1960, the former women's TB building had become a 117-bed maternity hospital, until closure in 1983. Camelot Court nursing home later opened in the administrative block of the former hospital in September 1985, while Groundslow Grange care home opened in October 1984 in the former nurses' accommodation, which had been built in 1949. It was run by Peter Ratchford and former Benny Hill girl Anne Bruzac. The residential care home closed in 1997, and by 2002 the adjacent former hospital was redeveloped into detached homes and terraces, while the Duke's former home was converted into 25 flats.Photos of Grounslow slow to load Retrieved Jan 2017 ==Village hall== The village hallTITTENSOR VILLAGE HALL website History page retrieved Jan 2017 is located just off the main A34 along Winghouse Lane.

The opening of the hall was held on Saturday 7 July 1956 and was performed by Mrs Maitland Wright on behalf of her mother Mrs Frank Wedgwood who was in South Africa. She was one of the prime movers in the campaign for a village hall. The brick-built hall, costing ¬£5,000, was designed and planned by Albert Homes an assistant Surveyor to the Stone Rural District Council, who lived right next door to the hall. The committee had been trying to get a hall for some six years, after residents had begun to subscribe money after the last war, some thirty years before. An alcove extension to the width of the hall was in the planning from 1985 with the free work being undertaken by the Community Programme Agency the original scheme to cost ¬£7,000 for materials. This turned out to become ¬£21,260 and by 1990 the Community Programme Agency was disbanded and became the Employment Training Division. Meanwhile, extensions to the kitchen and toilets were completed.in 1990. During 2003/4 a complete renovation was completed. This included new ceiling tiles and Led lighting, replacement flooring in the alcove, passage and kitchen new chairs, tables and curtains. To complete the project the hall was completely redecorated. A child's play area project was completed adjacent to the village hall using ¬£20,000 from Stafford Borough Council Section 106 funds (resulting from housing development at Groundslow) plus a grant from the Staffordshire Environmental Fund (landfill tax) of ¬£30,000. The grants were made to Swynnerton Parish Council and the land was also leased to them by the village hall. The council took the responsibility for ownership, maintenance and insurance. In 2013 a defibrillator was sited on the outside wall of the hall. Donations were received from all the village groups, Bassetts and the parish council of ¬£1,537. Training was given to two groups of residents. ==Facilities== In the village there is St Luke's Church,Website for St Luke's Church retrieved Jan 2017 a village shop and post office, a village hall, a car sales garage and a wine shop.

The grade II listed houses were designed by noted Monmouth architect and builder George Vaughan Maddox, who also designed at least two of the twenty-four blue plaque buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail, including the Market Hall and the Monmouth Methodist Church. Hendre House should be distinguished from The Hendre, the estate of the Rolls family. ==History and design== Kingsley House at 8 Monk Street and Hendre House at 10 Monk Street are a pair of early 19th-century, listed houses. The semi-detached houses together are in a three-storey building with a five-bay elevation. The exterior features a stucco finish and there is a hipped slate roof. The centre window bay of each of the three floors of the building is blocked. The windows on the ground floor are round-headed, and those on the uppermost floor are smaller than those on the ground and middle floors. The entrance to each house features a round-headed doorway with a six-paneled door and radiating fanlight (transom). Both dwellings were designed by George Vaughan Maddox, a Monmouth native who was an architect and builder. Maddox, who also designed Priory Street in Monmouth, resided at Kingsley House on nearby Monk Street during the time that Priory Street was planned and constructed. Not only was Maddox responsible for Priory Street and its Market Hall, which was completed in 1839, the prolific architect also designed a number of other notable buildings, including the Monmouth Methodist Church in St James Street, the Masonic Hall in Monk Street, and Oak House at 6 Monk Street. The Market Hall and the Monmouth Methodist Church are two of the twenty-four blue plaque buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. Maddox also designed Croft-Y-Bwla for Thomas Dyke, a Monmouth grocer. George Maddox was the son of James Maddox, another Monmouth architect and builder, who died in Monmouth in 1820. In 1934, Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire indicated that John James Furney resided at Kingsley House. Kingsley House and Hendre House are both grade II listed buildings on the west side of the North Parade section of Monk Street (north of the intersection of Monk Street with Priory Street and New Dixton Road). On 27 October 1965, both houses were listed. The Cadw Building ID Number for Kingsley House is 2275, and that for Hendre House is 85015. Hendre House should be distinguished from The Hendre, the childhood home of Charles Stewart Rolls, co-founder of Rolls-Royce Limited and aviation pioneer. The grade II* listed, Victorian country house at Llangattock-Vibon-Avel now functions as the clubhouse of the Rolls of Monmouth Golf Club. George Vaughan Maddox also served as an architect and builder for The Hendre, performing the first of the expansions of the mansion that were commissioned by three generations of the Rolls family. Originally a hunting lodge, The Hendre underwent reconstruction of portions of its south wing in 1830, performed by Maddox for John Rolls (1776-1837), great-grandfather of Charles. == References  External links == * The Hendre at The Rolls of Monmouth Category:Houses in Monmouth, Wales ","title":"Kingsley House and Hendre House, Monmouth"},{"id":"35843586","text":"Duke Xiang of Qi (; died 686 BC) was from 697 to 686 BC the fourteenth recorded ruler of the State of Qi, a major power during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. His personal name was L√º Zhu'er (ÂëÇË´∏ÂÖí), ancestral name Jiang (Âßú), and Duke Xiang was his posthumous title. Although under Duke Xiang the state of Qi conquered the neighbouring state of Ji, its traditional enemy, Duke Xiang is best known for his depravity, having had an incestuous relationship with his sister Wen Jiang and murdered his brother-in-law Duke Huan of Lu. At the end Duke Xiang was himself murdered by his cousin Wuzhi, who subsequently usurped the Qi throne. ==Murdering Duke Huan of Lu== Duke Xiang succeeded his father Duke Xi of Qi, who died in 698 BC after 33 years of reign. Duke Xiang had had an incestuous relationship with his younger half- sister Wen Jiang, who in 709 BC married Duke Huan, ruler of the neighbouring State of Lu. In 694 BC, Duke Huan of Lu visited Qi with his wife, and Duke Xiang and Wen Jiang renewed their sexual liaison. Chapter XII. When Duke Huan found out about the relationship between his wife and her own brother, Duke Xiang ordered his half brother Prince Pengsheng to murder Duke Huan in his carriage after he got drunk. The people of Lu were incensed at Duke Xiang's crime, but could not do anything because Qi was a stronger state. To appease Lu, Duke Xiang had Pengsheng executed as a scapegoat. Duke Zhuang of Lu, the son of Duke Huan and Wen Jiang, subsequently succeeded his father as ruler of Lu. ==Marriage== After the death of Duke Huan of Lu, Wen Jiang stayed in Qi and the incestuous relationship between the siblings continued. In 693 BC Duke Xiang married a daughter of the king of Zhou, the nominal ruler of all China, but the Zhou princess died only a year later. Chapter II. ==Conquering the State of Ji== In 690 BC the state of Qi conquered its neighbouring state of Ji (Á¥Ä). Ji had been the enemy of Qi since at least the reign of Duke Ai of Qi about two centuries before Duke Xiang's time. Duke Ai was boiled to death by King Yi of Zhou after being slandered by the Marquis of Ji. In 693 BC, Qi attacked the state of Ji, taking the cities of Ping, Zi, and Wu and expelling their residents. Two years later, a younger brother of the Marquis of Ji defected to Qi with the city of Xi. Unable to resist the aggression of Qi, in 690 BC the Marquis of Ji fled and gave over the state to the younger brother who had already submitted to Qi, effectively surrendering the state to Qi. The Marquis of Ji left in such a haste that he did not even bury his wife, a princess from the state of Lu, who had recently died. Duke Xiang gave the marquise a proper burial. Chapter IV. ==Death and succession== In the twelfth month of 686 BC, the twelfth year of his reign, Duke Xiang was killed by his cousin Wuzhi. Wuzhi had been a favoured nephew of Duke Xiang's father Duke Xi and was treated like a crown prince, but when Duke Xiang ascended the throne, he demoted the status of Wuzhi. After Duke Xiang injured his foot on a hunting trip, Wuzhi killed Duke Xiang in his palace with the help of generals Lian Cheng and Guan Zhifu, who had been mistreated by Duke Xiang. Wuzhi usurped the Qi throne after murdering Duke Xiang, but was also killed soon afterward. After a brief struggle between Duke Xiang's two younger brothers Prince Jiu and Prince Xiaobai, Xiaobai would win out and ascend the throne, posthumously known as Duke Huan of Qi. Qi would grow strong under Duke Huan's rule, and Duke Huan subsequently became the first of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period. ==Family== * Parents: ** Prince Lufu (; d. 698 BC), ruled as Duke Xi of Qi from 730‚Äì698 BC * Wives: ** Zhou Wang Ji, of the Ji clan of Zhou (), a daughter of King Huan of Zhou and a younger sister of King Zhuang of Zhou; married in 695 BC * Sons: ** Prince Ji (), the progenitor of the Qiji () lineage; fled to Chu in 686 BC * Daughters: ** Ai Jiang (; d. 660 BC) *** Married Duke Zhuang of Lu (706‚Äì662 BC) in 670 BC ** Shu Jiang () *** Married Duke Zhuang of Lu (706‚Äì662 BC) in 670 BC as Ai Jiang's dowry, and had issue (Duke Min of Lu) ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Monarchs of Qi (state) Category:7th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:686 BC deaths Category:7th-century BC murdered monarchs Category:Assassinated Chinese politicians Category:Incest ","title":"Duke Xiang of Qi"},{"id":"35843588","text":"Zakir Hussain (; January 1, 1934 ‚Äì August 19, 2019) was a Pakistani field hockey player.

The show was created by Jos√© Alvarenga Jr., Marcal Aquino and Fernando Bonassi. The latter two also wrote the script alongside Carolina Kotscho, Braulio Mantovani, Dennison Ramalho, Juliana Rojas, Raphael Draccon and Rafael Montes while Jos√© Eduardo Belmonte, Rafael Miranda and Alvarenga helm the directing team. In 2017, the series was nominated for the Seoul International Drama Awards in Best Series and Best Author Categories. == Production == The writing process of the series took place in the writer's room format in which the writers come together intensively for the creation and development of scripts. According to Carolina Kotscho, they had considerable freedom in writing: \\"we wrote without any limit. We imagined that eventually this limit would come, but it didn't. This was a grateful surprise!\\" According to Raphael Montes, one of the writers, Globo gave total freedom to the staff: \\"I remember a discussion in which we started to throw ideas and we said that this would never be aired, but they did film it! It was our will, the creation's, the direction's, the team's and Globo's itself to make something different, that has known and identifiable elements by the general public but at the same time innovating.\\" The creator and director Jos√© Alvarenga defined the series as a crossing of various genres; ranging from police thriller, horror, terror and suspense to romance. The series was inspired from the first season of True Detective, as well as other similar themed shows such as The Walking Dead, American Horror Story, Supernatural, The Hunger Games and Lost. To simulate the feel of a reality show as the plot demands, Alvarenga borrowed nine camera operators from Big Brother Brazil. The fictional 800 m¬≤ prison set, built in Est√∫dios Globo, was inspired from Alcatraz Prison. The casting aimed for names unknown to the general public. It also had a unique isolating element compared to other studios of Globo Studios, to keep those involved in the tense and sombre mood of the plot. It involved the knowledge of how to react to different scenes, like amputating a leg in cold blood, being strangled or finding an aberration, an unusual experience for Brazilian actors who were more used to drama and melodrama. Denisson Ramalho, a writer who specialises in horror movies, had said that \\"it is the most 'from hell' Brazilian TV series of all time\\". == Release == The series was expected to be released on October 2, 2015 after the end of Verdades Secretas. The series had its debut postponed to 2016 due to the advertising market being in a bad economic time. === International version === An international version for Hispanic channels is also expected to be produced in Spanish, with Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman as the director and Bruno Gagliasso starring as a transgender character. == Plot == Mixing fiction and reality, the series chronicles the journey of 12 participants (7 men and 5 women) in a reality show taking place at a disabled maximum security prison located in the Amazon rain forest. Each participant are not chosen by chance but have one thing in common: each of them committed a serious crime. All goes well on the first day of confinement until the production team disappears, leaving them to their own devices, with macabre and supernatural events occurring within the prison. Only one of them will win the prize of R$2 million, but they will have to leave the place alive. == Episodes == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\\" - style=\\"color:white;\\" ! 4B5320;\\" width=\\"5%\\" No. ! 4B5320;\\" width=\\"21%\\" Original title ! 4B5320;\\" width=\\"12%\\" Original air date ! 4B5320;\\" width=\\"9%\\" Brazil viewers - } == Cast Main Cast=== *Mariana Ximenes as Bruna, a nurse fired from a hospital where she used to take care of terminal patients. * Erom Cordeiro as S√©rgio, a police captain suspended for a crime he says he didn't commit. *Cl√©o Pires as Sabrina Toledo, a psychologist who was once kidnapped and spent a few months in captivity. *Bruno Belarmino as Luis√£o, a former MMA fighter that is constantly affected by a recurring guilt and spends time trying to control his anger and violence. *Nicolas Trevijano as Father Nando, who dedicated most of his life to the Church, and considers his suspension unfair. *Maria Clara Spinelli as Janette, owner of a chain of beauty salons who had a miserable childhood with her alcoholic and violent father. *Ravel Andrade as Dante, the youngest participant and an enthusiast for obscure cults. *Rui Ricardo Dias as Artur, a former football player who still believes to be active. *Fabiana Gugli as Diana, a housewife who recently lost her husband. *M√°rio C√©sar Camargo as Dr. Tim√≥teo, a reformed Army physician. *V√¢nia de Brito as Cec√≠lia Damasceno, a woman that reached Rio de Janeiro's elite, but is now close to misery following the death of her husband and son. *Ademir Emboava as Jos√© Augusto, an economist linked to politicians who acted as a fund raiser for a political party. *M√°rcio Fecher as Nonato/Baal, one of the people who worked at the construction of the prison.

Her imaginary world is populated by mystical hybrid creatures bound together in intimate and affectionate companionship. Although best known for her huge wire sculptures, Ryder uses many other materials - bronze, wet plaster embedded with old machine parts, sheet metal, marble, and stained glass. Drawing, painting and printmaking have always been central to her artistic practice and are a vital creative counterpoint to her sculptural work. ==Biography== Sophie Ryder was born in London, England, in 1963. She studied combined arts at the Royal Academy of Arts 1981-84, where, while obtaining her diploma in painting, she was encouraged by fellow artists to develop her sculpture. Ryder's world is one of mystical creatures, animals and hybrid beings made from sawdust, wet plaster, old machine parts and toys, weld joins and angle grinders, wire 'pancakes', torn scraps of paper, charcoal sticks and acid baths. She developed the Lady Hare as a counterpart to Ancient Greek mythology's Minotaur. Working 'big' is a very significant feature of Ryder's work, and she enjoys rising to the constructional and creative challenges which flow from this aspiration. ===Works=== Ryder has mainly focused her work on mythical creatures. Her most known piece is the Lady Hare, a hare with a female human body. In 1994 a sculpture of five minotaurs was banned from an exhibition at Winchester Cathedral because of the prominence of their genitalia. ===Influences=== When asked about what influences her, Ryder replies, \\"I don't sit and contemplate what it is I am trying to achieve. My head is full of ideas all the time. It is part of my life. I don't plan anything, it just comes.\\" When asked why she portrays hares she replied, \\"Well, I find it difficult answering that question because I don't really know the answer. It's the same as asking me why I make sculptures, and the answer is, because I feel driven to. So it's difficult to always pin down reasons. My introduction to hares was when my lurcher dog would proudly bring hares home and drop them at my feet.\\" == References  * Sophie Ryder website * Hignell Gallery website Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:English women sculptors Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy Schools Category:Sculptors from London Category:21st-century British women artists ","title":"Sophie Ryder"},{"id":"35843854","text":"Mundum (Bamundum) is a Grassfields Bantu language spoken in Cameroon.

Shortly before the completion of her sea trials and impending induction into the Imperial Chinese Navy, the 267-year reign of the Manchu Qing Dynasty came to an end when Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Xinhai Revolution forced the abdication of the child-emperor Puyi and created the Republic of China.Rhoads, Edward J.M.. Manchus & Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861‚Äì1928. University of Washington Press. 2000, p. 150. The Chao Ho would subsequently enter service with the Republic of China Navy. The Chao Ho-class cruisers were unusual in that all three semi-sister ships were built in different ship building yards, and although all three ships were built to the same basic design, they varied in size, armour and displacement, of which Chao Ho was the largest and longest, and all three ships carried varied assortments of guns (as opposed to uniform main armament). These were done to increase the educational effectiveness of the ships, in order to familiarize their crews with various boiler and weapons systems. Chao Hos hull was laid down on 7 October 1910 by at Elswick, Tyne and Wear by Armstrong Whitworth. She was launched on 23 October 1911 and finished her naval trials on 21 February 1912, nine days after the Xinhai Revolution brought down the Qing Dynasty. In 1913, after a long loan negotiation, she was delivered to China in March.Wright, Richard N.J.. The Chinese Steam Navy 1862‚Äì1945. Chatham Publishing, 2000, pp. 125‚Äì126. ==Design== Chao Ho as mentioned differed from her two sister ships, as she was larger than either or Fei Hung. Chao Ho was larger in beam than Ying Rui, and weighted 290 t more. Ying Ruis foremast was stepped further aft and her funnels were spaced wider. Chao Ho also had thicker armour ( compared to Ying Ruis on the main deck and compared to on her conning tower). Chao Hos primary armament were two Armstrong Pattern NN /50 guns which were mounted on the forecastle and poop. As a protected cruiser Chao Ho did not have belt armor. The only armor was on her deck, guns and conning tower. The remaining artillery were placed on the main deck.Gray, Randall. Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, Volume 2. Conway Maritime Press, 1985, pp. 396‚Äì397. ==Service record== Chao Hos first incident was in December 1915, when the cruiser was briefly captured by Southern Chinese rebels during the National Protection War. During the lawless Warlord Era of the Republic of China, Chao Ho was often called into action to bombard rebel positions but in December 1923 Zhili Clique Warlord Wu Peifu representing the Beiyang Government bribed half of the Chinese Navy into his service including Chao Ho where they were used guard the naval base of Qingdao (formerly the German Empire concession of Kiautschou), the most advanced port in China at the time. The fleet of five ships (the cruisers , , Chao Ho) and the gunboats and arrived at Qingdao on 5 January 1924 and would become known as the Northern Fleet. After the Zhili Clique's defeat during the Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War, control of Qingdao and its fleet passed to the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian clique. By this time, the Northern Fleet had been renamed the North East Fleet as the collection of ships have become known as had gone into disrepair, many unable to exceed . Zhang, who had always been close politically to the Empire of Japan had Chao Ho and the rest of his fleet refitted by Japanese engineers in 1927. In 1927, the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China, led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek launched his decisive Northern Expedition to finally bring the Northern Chinese warlords under his heel. While commanding his newly formed and trained National Revolutionary Army, the Kuomintang had little in the way of a navy after the mass defection of 1923. Throughout 1927 the newly refitted Chao Ho made several sorties to bombard the Nationalist naval fortifications at Wusong off the coast of Shanghai and participated in the brief occupation of the island of Kinmen off the coast of Xiamen in May 1928. After months of hard fighting, the Kuomintang eventually defeated the Warlord cliques after capturing Beijing in 1928. The fleeing Zhang was assassinated when the train he was in was blown up by Japanese officers of the Kwangtung Army to punish him for his failures in defeating Chiang. His son, Zhang Xueliang then pledged allegiance to Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang government. The former Beiyang Governments North East Fleet was reintegrated into the Republic of China Navy. In 1930 two QF 2 pounder anti-aircraft guns were added to Chao Ho on a platform at the base of the mainmast. The former North East Fleet was renamed Third Squadron and remained in Qingdao. Problems with Chao Ho did not end with her return in 1928 though. In July 1933, a lieutenant from the auxiliary gunboat Chen Hai attempted to assassinate Admiral Shen Hung-lieh (who was also the mayor of Qingdao) over wages and was immediately executed. In sympathy the Third Squadron which consisted of Hai Chi, Hai Chen and Chao Ho mutinied and sailed to Guangzhou, governed by general Chen Jitang. Due to the fractured, clique ridden nature of the Republic of China in the wake of the Northern Expedition, the mutineers were welcomed by the city as useful reinforcements for the Cantonese faction within the Chinese government. Unfortunately, even in Guangzhou, the former North East Fleet remained underpaid, underemployed and unappreciated. When the original leader of the mutineers, Rear-Admiral Kiang Hsi-yuan was replaced by a local Cantonese commander, the three ships once again mutinied and left Guangzhou on 15 June 1935. Chao Ho was left behind not long after due to becoming stuck in mud. Hai Chi and Hai Chen would go on to be involved in a naval stand off between themselves and the new, modern light cruiser which was carrying the admiral of the fleet Chan Chak on board. Several warning shots were fired by Ning Hai towards the mutineers but, after tense negotiations the situation was resolved without bloodshed on 18 July. War between China and Japan resumed in 1937, with Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China, and quickly capturing the cities of Beiping and Tianjin. At the time Chao Ho was stationed at the naval fort in Bocca Tigris to guard the city of Guangzhou and the entrance to the Pearl River. On 14 September 1937. Chao Ho and Hai Chow (formerly the sloop HMS Pentstemon) engaged the and the destroyers and . The Japanese ships were forced to retreat with the aide of the Bocca Tigris' forts land based artillery but both ships were damaged. After this set back Japan sent the aircraft carriers and against the forts and ships at the mouth of the Pearl River as part of a larger strategic bombing campaign against the Pearl River Delta and the city of Guangzhou, the fortifications and ports were heavily bombed. On 30 September 1937 Chao Ho was sunk by Japanese aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service.Wright 2000, pp. 138‚Äì148. ==See also== * Beiyang Navy * Zhili clique * Fengtian clique * Warlord Era ==NotesRepublic of China Navy Category:Chao Ho-class cruisers Category:1911 ships Category:Ships built by Armstrong Whitworth Category:Second Sino-Japanese War cruisers of China Category:Cruisers sunk by aircraft Category:Ships sunk by Japanese aircraft Category:Shipwrecks of China Category:Maritime incidents in 1937 Category:World War II naval ships of China ","title":"Chinese cruiser Chao Ho"},{"id":"35843985","text":"Leti is a Bantu language of Cameroon, spoken by the Mengisa people.

During World War II, Lakey was a member of several U.S. Army bands. He also directed his own band (1946).Record Review: Claude Lakey, Billboard Magazine, pg. 108, September 14, 1946 In 1947, Lakey enrolled at the University of North Texas during its inaugural year of first jazz degree program offered in the world. In 1949, at the request of Gene Hall, the jazz program's founding director, Lakey, as student conductor, became the first conductor of the Laboratory Dance Band, the original name of the One O'Clock Lab Band.Interview Music America magazine: Volume 1, Issue 6 (1977), Amordian Press After various stints directing youth bands in the Los Angeles suburbs -- San Fernando Valley Youth Band and Claudhoppers Youth Band -- and running his own music retail store, Lakey founded (circa 1963) Claude Lakey Mouthpieces, Inc., maker of woodwind mouthpieces. In 1990, he sold the company to Nicholas D. Bogden (born 1947) who moved it from Nacogdoches, Texas, to Redmond, Washington and operates the company under its original name. Bogden, in the 1980s, had been the general manager of Rumbo Recorders, a three studio audio recording facility located in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. ==CLM Inc.== Being a jazz musician himself, and after working with many other jazz artists, Claude realized there wasn't a saxophone mouthpiece available that met his standards and standards that many other artists had been looking for. He began taking blanks and making changes to suit his requirements. Once satisfied with his design, he found an adequate mold maker and began selling his finished product in the back corner of C&D; Music Company. The mouthpiece business quickly grew, so Claude decided to sell C&D; Music Company to Nick Bogden and just focus on his new business venture. He moved the business back to Nacogdoches, TX where he continued to sell to individual artists as well as a few distributors in the US. Nick Bogden helped build Rumbo Recorders (owned by \\"The Capitan and Tennille\\") in Canoga Park, Ca. and was the studio manager. Nick recorded and worked with Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Bob Seager, Survivor, Super Tramp, Survivor(Eye Of The Tiger), The Beach Boys, Guns & Roses, and many other artists during the great period of Rumbo Recorders. In the early 1990s, Claude wanted to retire and sell his business to someone he trusted to use the same care in handcrafting mouthpieces and carry on his legacy. He called Nick to see if he would be interested in buying the business. Nick agreed and flew to Texas to learn how Claude Lakey Mouthpieces were made. During the process of selling the company, Claude was diagnosed with cancer and died one month later at the age of 80. Nick completed the sale through the estate and moved the business to Redmond, WA. Because of the dedication and care Nick took to maintain the standard Claude built his company with, Claude Lakey Mouthpieces is now one of the most recognized names in the industry. With four major distributors in the US, and distributors in over 20 countries world wide, the company ensures their mouthpieces are available to student and professional musicians no matter where they are. In 2013 the company is celebrating \\"50 years of jazz\\" with new products being introduced to further help musicians 'find their voice'. == Family == Marriages * In the mid 1930s, Claude was married to the big band singer Bonnie Baker, the stage name for Evelyn Reyo Lakey (n√©e Nelson; 1917‚Äì1990).

It was acquired by Boyd Gaming in 2012. ==History== In January 1999, Los Angeles-based AB Capital agreed to purchase the Diamond Jo Casino in Dubuque, Iowa for $77 million. The company's major shareholders were Los Angeles investment banker Brent Stevens and Las Vegas gaming developer Michael Luzich. The purchase was completed in July 1999, by which time the company had changed its name to Peninsula Gaming. In February 2002, Peninsula bought a fifty percent interest in the Evangeline Downs racetrack in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana from B. I. Moody for $15 million. They bought the remaining half several months later from William Trotter for another $15 million, plus 0.5% of slot revenues for the first ten years. After Lafayette voters had rejected slot machines at the track, Evangeline Downs had planned a move to St. Landry Parish, which Peninsula carried out. The casino at the new site opened in late 2003, with races following in 2005. In 2004, Peninsula announced a proposed sister casino to the Diamond Jo, to be built in Worth County, Iowa at a cost of $40 million. The project was awarded a gaming license in May 2005, and the Diamond Jo Worth opened in April 2006. In 2009, Peninsula proposed building a $150-million racetrack casino in Des Moines, Iowa that would be a sister property to the Prairie Meadows racino. Prairie Meadows ultimately rejected the plan. In June 2009, Peninsula agreed to buy the Amelia Belle riverboat casino in Amelia, Louisiana from Columbia Sussex for $106.5 million. The purchase closed in October 2009. In November 2009, the company partnered with a group of local investors in a proposal to build a casino in Fort Dodge, Iowa. The application for Diamond Jo Fort Dodge was ultimately rejected by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, over concerns that the casino would draw too much business from the Wild Rose Casino in Emmetsburg. Criminal charges were later filed against Peninsula and two of its executives (Martin Brent Stevens and Jonathan Swain), alleging that they improperly funneled $25,000 in campaign contributions to Governor Chet Culver through three of the Fort Dodge investors. The case was ultimately settled, with the criminal charges being dismissed and Peninsula agreeing to pay the costs of the investigation plus a $4,000 civil penalty. In the settlement agreement, the company and its executives specifically den[ied] that they intended to violate the law. In 2010, Peninsula held discussions with the city of Davenport, Iowa about redeveloping or replacing the Rhythm City Casino, but the company withdrew to focus on its proposed Kansas casino. In July 2010, Peninsula submitted a bid for the sole available casino license in south central Kansas, proposing to build the Kansas Star Casino in Mulvane. The proposal was selected as the winner, and Peninsula opened the casino in a temporary facility in December 2011, moving to a permanent facility in December 2012. In May 2012, Boyd Gaming agreed to buy Peninsula Gaming for $1.45 billion. Boyd executives particularly emphasized the high growth potential of the Kansas Star Casino. The acquisition was completed on November 20, 2012. ==Properties== *Amelia Belle Casino ‚Äî Amelia, Louisiana *Diamond Jo Casino ‚Äî Dubuque, Iowa *Diamond Jo Casino ‚Äî Northwood, Iowa *Evangeline Downs Racetrack & Casino ‚Äî Opelousas, Louisiana **Off-track betting parlors in Eunice, Henderson, Port Allen, St. Martinville *Kansas Star Casino ‚Äî Mulvane, Kansas ==References== Category:Gambling companies established in 1999 Category:Gambling companies disestablished in 2012 Category:Gambling companies of the United States Category:Defunct gambling companies Category:1999 establishments in Iowa Category:2012 disestablishments in Iowa ","title":"Peninsula Gaming"},{"id":"35844020","text":"Yambeta is a Southern Bantoid language of Cameroon. ==References== Category:Mbam languages Category:Languages of Cameroon ","title":"Yambeta language"},{"id":"35844030","text":"Tuotomb, or Bonek, is a Southern Bantoid language of Cameroon. ==References== Category:Mbam languages Category:Languages of Cameroon ","title":"Tuotomb language"},{"id":"35844051","text":"The Mandi language, Nomaande (or Lemande), is a Southern Bantoid language of Cameroon. ==References== Category:Mbam languages Category:Languages of Cameroon ","title":"Mandi language"},{"id":"35844053","text":"The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond is a 1960 neo-noir crime film directed by Budd Boetticher.

A native of Montgomery, Alabama, he spent his fighting career based in Chicago. Tate was a regular sparring partner of heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, yet Dempsey denied him a shot at the title. Tate graduated from Alabama's Normal School for Colored Students, a state- supported teacher's college for African Americans, in 1905. He reigned as the World Colored Heavyweight Champion from 25 January 1917, when he beat Sam Langford, to 25 May 1917, when Langford reclaimed the title. ==Boxing career== Tate's first professional bout was with former World Colored Heavyweight Champion Joe Jeanette on 20 August 1912 at Morris Park in Newark, New Jersey. He was knocked out in the 2nd round. He met Jeanrette three more times in 1914‚Äì15, and lost all three bouts. On 11 June 1916, he fought Kid Norfolk in the Bull Ring in Panama City for the vacant Panamanian heavyweight title. Norfolk won by points in 20 rounds, reportedly giving Tate a beating. ===World Colored Heavyweight Champion=== After beating Rufe Cameron on October 16 of that year and losing a newspaper decision to former World Colored Heavyweight Champion Harry Wills on Armistice Day, he first fought Sam Langford, the man who had taken the title from Wills, on November 20 for the title in Syracuse, New York. In a 10-round bout, Langford was declared the winner by the Syracuse Herald while the Syracuse Post-Standard gave its newspaper decision to Tate. Langford was still recognized as the colored champ. After beating Lou Bodie in Syracuse on 12 January 1917, thirteen days later, Tate met Langford for a rematch at the Grand Opera House in Kansas City, Missouri and won the title with a 12-round decision. His rein as Colored Heavyweight Champ was short- lived, a little more than four months, as Langford retook the title on May 1 at the Future City Athletic Club in St. Louis, Missouri, KO-ing Tate in the 5th round. In all, Tate fought Langford nine times from 1916 to 1922, winning four fights aside from their \\"split decision\\" in their first bout. He fought three-time Colored Heavyweight Champion Harry Wills seven times, including twice in a four-day period in 1922. Tate lost their first bout, a 10-round fight held on November 11, 1916 at Brooklyn's Clermont Avenue Rink, by a newspaper decision. On 17 January 1921, at the Broadway Auditorium in Buffalo, New York, Tate challenged Wills for his colored heavyweight title but was KO- ed in the second round. On July 2 of that year, Tate again met Wills in a title bout held at Queensboro Stadium in Long Island City, Queens, New York, but lost by a technical knockout in the sixth. After beating Sam Langford in Covington, Kentucky in a 12-round newspaper decision, he again met the colored champ Wills in a title match. On 8 December 1921, Wills outpointed Tate in a 12-round bout at Denver's Stockyards Stadium, retaining his title. Less than a month later, on 6 January 1922, they fought again, at the Arena in Milwaukie, Oregon. In the first round of the scheduled 10-round fight, the referee disqualified Wills for throwing a punch that knocked down Tate down after the referee had called for a break. They agreed to meet again, and four days later, Wills drew with Tate on points in 10 rounds. Tate would later claim he won the fight the colored heavyweight title as he had knocked Wills down in ninth with a rabbit punch, but referee Tom Louttit did not give a count. Wills was recognized as the champ. ==Career record== Though he would fight Wills again as the top heavyweights were forced to fight each other due to the color bar, Tate never again fought for the colored title. Both he and Wills were hoping for a title shot from Dempsey, but neither got it. In his 15-year career, the 6'6¬Ω‚Ä≥\\" tall Tate (who weighted at between 220 and 243 lbs.) compiled an official record of 27 wins (22 by knockout, 19 losses (knocked out 10 times) and 2 draws in 50 fights (the results of two fights with Sam McVea are unknown ). He also racked up 17 newspaper decisions, winning six, losing nine and drawing twice. ==Legacy & Honors== In 2020 award-winning author Mark Allen Baker published the first comprehensive account of The World Colored Heavyweight Championship, 1876-1937, with McFarland & Company, a leading independent publisher of academic & nonfiction books. This history traces the advent and demise of the Championship, the stories of the talented professional athletes who won it, and the demarcation of the color line both in and out of the ring. For decades the World Colored Heavyweight Championship was a useful tool to combat racial oppression-the existence of the title a leverage mechanism, or tool, used as a technique to counter a social element, ‚Äúdrawing the color line.‚Äù ==References * Category:Boxers from Alabama Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:African-American boxers Category:World colored heavyweight boxing champions Category:1896 births Category:1953 deaths Category:American male boxers ","title":"Bill Tate (boxer)"},{"id":"35844231","text":"David Grimaldi may refer to: * David Grimaldi (entomologist) (born 1957), American entomologist and curator * David Grimaldi (soccer) (born 1954), retired American soccer defender * David Grimaldi (politician) (born 1978), American businessman and politician ","title":"David Grimaldi"},{"id":"35844233","text":"Sultan Ismail Building () is the meeting places for the Johor State Legislative Assembly.

To control costs, the ships will not be built to combat vessel standards and are designed primarily to support three military hovercraft (such as the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC)), vehicle staging with a sideport ramp and large mooring fenders. A decision was made to eliminate helicopter capability and ship-to- ship transfer of heavy equipment. The propulsion motors are of British design and build. Power conversion company Converteam was selected as the supplier of Integrated Power Systems with the award of an additional contract to design and supply the electric power, propulsion and vessel automation system.

His career included service in World War II, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War, duty aboard and command of cruisers and destroyers, various planning and staff assignments, and a tour as President of the Naval War College. ==Early life== LeBourgeois was born in Southern Pines, North Carolina, on 23 November 1923, the son of U.S. Navy Commander Henry Blow LeBourgeois and Dorothy Johnson LeBourgeois. He was raised in Long Beach, California, and Suva, American Samoa, and attended the Georgia Military Academy in College Park, Georgia. He entered the United States Naval Academy in 1941, where he was a member of the track team, and graduated in 1944 after only three years due to the accelerated curriculum in use during World War II.USS Norris Ship's Captains: LeBourgeois '59-'61Anonomyous, \\"Obituaries of Note: Julien J. LeBourgeois, Navy Vice Admiral,\\" The Washington Post, September 28, 2012, p. B8.Anonymous, \\"Obituary: Julien J. LeBourgeois,\\" unionleader.com September 24, 2012 ==Naval careerWorld War II=== LeBourgeois first assignment was as a gunnery officer aboard the light cruiser , then in combat against the Japanese in the Pacific. Aboard Columbia he saw action in the Palau campaign, including the Battle of Peleliu, and in the Leyte campaign, during which Columbia fought in the Battle of Surigao Strait, a part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Columbia also supported the invasion of Mindoro and took part in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf on Luzon, during which three kamikazes struck Columbia and for which the ship was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation. After that, Columbia operated in support of the invasion of Balikpapan and took part in the 1945 antishipping sweep in the South China Sea. ===1946-1965=== LeBourgeois remained aboard Columbia through the end of World War II in August 1945 and for an additional year beyond, leaving her in August 1946 to report for duty as gunnery officer and first lieutenant aboard the destroyer escort . In June 1947 he transferred to the destroyer and served as her gunnery officer, first lieutenant, and damage control officer over the next two years. Beginning in July 1949, LeBourgeois attended first the Naval Intelligence School and then the Naval Language School in Washington, D.C., becoming a qualified interpreter and translator in the French language. He then served in the Office of Naval Intelligences Counterintelligence Division from June 1950 to July 1951 before moving on to Tangier, Morocco, where he was the assistant naval attach√© at the American Legation. In October 1953, LeBourgeois began his next assignment, a tour as communications officer on the staff of Commander, Destroyer Flotilla 4. In August 1955, he moved to the Current Intelligence Branch of the Joint Staff in the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In September 1957, LeBourgeois began his next sea tour, joining the pre-commissioning detail of the new destroyer . When Blandy was commissioned on 26 November 1957, he became her first executive officer. During his tour, which lasted until January 1959, Blandy operated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean and, in 1958, transported the Unknown Soldiers of World War II and the Korean War to Washington, D.C., for final interment in the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. After leaving Blandy, LeBourgeois attended the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, before becoming commanding officer of the destroyer on 28 July 1959. While he was in command, Norris had the highest competitive score overall for destroyers in the United States Atlantic Fleet for the fiscal year 1961 and received the Battle Efficiency Award twice, among other awards. LeBourgeois relinquished command of Norris on 3 April 1961 and joined the staff of Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, where he led a team of officers who prepared the first curriculum for the Destroyer School. He then attended the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in Washington, D.C., from July 1961 to June 1962. After completing his studies, he was assigned to the Strategic Plans Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, earning a Master's degree in International Affairs from George Washington University in 1963 during his tour. From December 1962 to June 1965, he was executive assistant and senior aide to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Plans and Policy). He received the Legion of Merit for this tour. ===Vietnam War=== In September 1965, LeBourgeois took command of the guided-missile frigate (later reclassified as a guided-missile cruiser) (later CG-23). Under his command, Halsey deployed off Vietnam in 1966 during the Vietnam War. During her deployment, LeBourgeois also served as Commander, Southern Anti-Air/Search and Rescue Element in the Gulf of Tonkin, where forces under his command rescued 17 airmen shot down over North Vietnam. In one such rescue, LeBourgeois was instrumental in the saving of Colonel Victor Vizcarra, by ordering his ship to flank speed (approximately 42 knots) to reduce the distance between the USS Halsey and the rescue helicopter that was dangerously low on fuelhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt7116548/. He received the Bronze Star Medal with Combat Distinguishing Device. For the same period, Halsey was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. Halsey also was awarded the Battle Efficiency Award, among other awards, for her performance under LeBourgeois command during 1966. ===1967-1977=== In July 1967, LeBourgeois left Halsey for an assignment in the Systems Analysis Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. In April 1968 he became executive assistant and senior aide to the Chief of Naval Operations. He received a second award of the Legion of Merit for his service in this tour. In January 1970, LeBourgeois, newly promoted to rear admiral, became Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff (Plans and Policy) on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) staff of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in Casteau, Belgium. He received the Distinguished Service Medal for this tour. In May 1972, LeBourgeois was promoted to vice admiral and began an assignment as chief of staff to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) in Norfolk, Virginia. On 9 August 1974, LeBourgeois became the 38th President of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. During his presidency, he consolidated and refined radical curriculum changes made by his predecessor, Vice Admiral Stansfield Turner. He also laid the groundwork for the creation of the Center for Advanced Research at the college and initiated the establishment of the Naval War College Museum, a museum of naval history and of the U.S. Navys regional history in Founders Hall.Past Presidents page at Naval War College official Web site. His tour as president ended on 1 April 1977, at which time he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal. Upon completion of his Naval War College tour, LeBourgeois retired from the Navy as a vice admiral. ==Personal life== LeBourgeois was married to Priscilla Dudley LeBourgeois for nearly 64 years, and she survived him at his death. Other survivors include a son, Julien Dudley LeBourgeois, and daughter, Anne Armour LeBourgeois. ==Retirement and death== After retiring, LeBourgeois moved to New London, New Hampshire, where he led the creation of the popular \\"Adventures in Learning\\" continuing-education program at Colby-Sawyer College. In 2004, the college presented him with the Town Award for his involvement in the community and his contributions to the school. He later moved to Williamsburg, Virginia. Suffering from heart and kidney disease, LeBourgeois died in a retirement community in Williamsburg on 16 September 2012. He was to be buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland, in October 2012, but Hurricane Sandy forced a postponement of his funeral until 22 March 2013, when his cremated remains were interred with full military honors. ==Awards== * Distinguished Service Medal (two awards) * Legion of Merit (two awards) *106px Bronze Star with Combat \\"V\\" ==NotesReferences== *Past Presidents page at Naval War College official Web site *A History of U.S.S.

Only seven identified specimens have been examined, with few found fully intact, and have mainly been found in the Southern Ocean. Agrostichthys parkeri belongs to the Regalecidae (oarfish) family in the Lampriformes order and is the only known member of its genus. This species has been known to grow up to 3 metres (around 10 feet) long and has a ribbon-like body, two large eyes, a protruding mouth and long filamentous rays originating at the head. Due to only seven specimens being found, only the distribution and anatomy of Agrostichthys parkeri can be documented. == Anatomy and morphology == Agrostichthys parkeri has an elongated, vertically compressed body which slims down to a point at the end. The body is not covered in scales, but rather small, horny nodules (dermal tubercles) that extend in longitudinal rows down the length of the body. Agrostichthys parkeri has a defined, protruding mouth with outer enlarged maxillae on a small, slender head that continues seamlessly right into the elongated body. Only the upper jaw protrudes, forming a long, tubular opening. Agrostichthys parkeri has two large, circular eyes with dark irises and clear pupils. Its dorsal fin has two parts, one part a triangular-like fin starting on its head right behind its eyes and the second part a low fin that extends all the way down the body to the caudal fin. Two filamentous rays (specimens have been known to have up to seven rays) also extend from the front of the dorsal fin, where one ray is much longer than the other ray and extends to almost the entire length of the body. Most specimens appeared to be missing their caudal fins, which naturally would be divided in two like scissors, showing that it is common to lose their caudal fins in nature. Agrostichthys parkeri has around 175 to 180 vertebra bones. Right behind the head, the vertebra bones are similar in diameter and length, but farther down the body, both the diameter and length decrease. The color of Agrostichthys parkeri is mainly shiny, bright, bluish silver with vertical dusky bands on the back and underside. Apart from the shiny silver of the body, the head has a slight reddish tint to it. Melanophores cover the area of the face from around the mouth, to the nose openings, and above the brain. The dorsal fin that extends the length of the body is bright pink with dark bands. Although not much is known about the reproduction of Agrostichthys parkeri, due to the study on a large specimen caught in Napier, New Zealand, it is known that A. parkeri eggs are a pale amber color, and are about 4 mm in diameter. == Distribution == Agrostichthys parkeri has mainly been found in the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean and around New Zealand, off northern Tasmania. The latitudinal distribution of specimens caught is from 39¬∞N to 42¬∞S. The specimens around New Zealand were found at depth of about 12 to 108 meters from mid-water trawling but have also been caught in deep waters, going from depths of 500 to 5,000 meters. From the A. parkeri specimens found, it appears to be common around the southwestern Pacific Ocean. One specimen was also found washed up on a beach in Playa Union on the southern tip of South America in Chubut, Argentina. Specimens have only been found in New Zealand, waters around Australia, southern Africa and Argentinian seas. In all cases, A. parkeri has been found in solitary. ==References== * Category:Lampriformes Category:Fish described in 1904 Category:Regalecidae ","title":"Agrostichthys parkeri"},{"id":"35844527","text":"Apache Gold (, later retitled to Winnetou ‚Äì 1. Teil), also known as Winnetou the Warrior, is a 1963 Western film directed by Harald Reinl. It is based on the story of Winnetou, a fictional Native-American Apache hero from the Winnetou series of German novels. It was a major commercial success, selling about tickets at the worldwide box office. It was shot at the Spandau Studios in Berlin and on location in Croatia. The film's sets were designed by the art director Vladimir Tadej. ==Plot== Santer (Mario Adorf) and his gang are after the Apache Gold. They intrude Apache land and intercept a courier named Black Eagle. The young warrior is killed while the gangsters attempt to retrieve information from him. Meanwhile the young chartered surveyor Charlie aka ‚ÄûOld Shatterhand‚Äú (Lex Barker) discovers that the ‚ÄûGreat Western Railway‚Äú commits a breach of valid contracts by taking a shortcut through Apache land. He is told that certain geological complications would leave the company no other choice but he can refute these allegations as a pretext to save money even at the costs of lives. Winnetou (Pierre Brice) observes how the railway is built right into the land of his tribe. On his way back to his village he comes across the corpse of Black Eagle. He brings Black Eagle to his family and reports to his father Intschu-tschuna. Chief Intshu-tshuna is deeply worried that even more villains like Santer will get to the Apache land and consequently waste his people if the ‚ÄûGreat Western Railway‚Äú can carry on. A missionary called ‚ÄûKlekih-petra‚Äú beseeches him not to start a war. He talks the aristocratic chief and his son Winnetou into setting up a meeting with a deputation of the Great Western Railway. Proceedings are prepared and Old Shatterhand is chosen to convince the Indians that the company will respect the contracts after all. But Santer doesn't let go of his ambitions. He strives to give Winnetou's people a bad name, so that the U.S.Army will come and drive the people off their land, hereby making way for his personal ambitions. Santer persuades the chief of a Kiowa tribe to attack the meeting. Klekih-petra is hereby killed and Winnetou is captured by his arch enemies who plan to torture him. Old Shatterhand risks his life in order to save Winnetou. At night he sneaks into the Kiowa's camp and cuts the chief's son's fetters. Winnetou can escape but doesn't see his saviour. Now Old Shatterhand and his supporters commence a crusade against Santer and his henchmen. They go to Santers strongpoint, a town called Roswell. There a tremendous fight takes place. But Winnetou also has unfinished business with Santer and goes there too. As an outsider he cannot tell the good men from the bad ones. He and his warriors attack the whole town. Old Shatterhand gets wounded and is captured. Winnetou has him brought to the Apache village. Thanks to the dedication of Intschu-tschuna's daughter Nsho-tshi (Marie Versini) he survives. But once he has recovered he must stand trial. He claims an ordeal by battle. Chief Intshu-tshuna himself takes him on and Old Shatterhand can scarcely win. After Old Shatterhand has spared the chief and Nsho-tshi has discovered proof that Shatterhand did free her brother, Shatterhand and Winnetou become officially friends. Although this tribe is at the brink of civilisation and the leading family does already build houses, Nsho-tshi wants to attend a school in St.Louis before she marries Old Shatterhand. In order to cover the looming expenses her family goes to their source of gold. But Santer is still alive and hasn't ceased to pursue his evil plans. He follows and ambushes them. Winnetou's father dies during the fight and Nsho-tshi dies only little later in the arms of Old Shatterhand. ==CastAwards== *Goldene Leinwand (\\"Golden Screen\\") *Bambi ==Background== The English version is shorter than the original German one. Many of Ralf Wolter's scenes, in which he acts in the manner of Benny Hill, are shorter. Moreover Chris Howland's appearances as a preposterous self-declared scholar have been dropped completely. ==Box office== It was the highest-grossing film of 1963 in West Germany, selling tickets and grossing . In Poland, it sold about tickets, breaking the all-time record for the highest-grossing foreign film in Poland. It was later released in the Soviet Union, where it sold 56 million tickets in 1975, becoming the third highest-grossing foreign film of the year and the 12th highest-grossing foreign film ever in the Soviet Union. In total, the film sold about tickets at the worldwide box office. ==United States== Released on a limited basis in the United States by Columbia Pictures, the film was aired on television in several cities. ==See also== *Broken Arrow (1950 film) *White Feather (1955 film) *Last of the Renegades *List of highest-grossing non-English films ==References*Apache Gold (as Winnetou I) at Rialto Film *In-depth review by Timothy Young Category:1963 films Category:1963 Western (genre) films Category:Films based on works by Karl May Category:Films based on German novels Category:Films based on Western (genre) novels Category:Films directed by Harald Reinl Category:German-language films Category:German Western (genre) films Category:Italian-language films Category:Italian Western (genre) films Category:Spaghetti Western films Category:West German films Category:Yugoslav films Category:Films shot in Croatia Category:Films shot in Yugoslavia Category:Films produced by Horst Wendlandt Category:1960s buddy films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Constantin Film films Category:Films set in the 19th century Category:1960s historical films Category:German historical films Category:Italian historical films Category:Italian films ","title":"Apache Gold"},{"id":"35844528","text":"Kenyan R. McDuffie (born c. 1975) is an American lawyer and Democratic politician in Washington, D.C. He is a member of the Council of the District of Columbia representing Ward 5 since 2012. ==Early life== McDuffie grew up in Stronghold, a neighborhood in Ward 5 in Washington, D.C. After graduating from Woodrow Wilson High School, he sold ice cream at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. and briefly attended the University of the District of Columbia. He later worked for the United States Postal Service, delivering mail in the Friendship Heights and Spring Valley neighborhoods. After four years with the Postal Service, McDuffie enrolled in the University of the District of Columbia before graduating from Howard University summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in political science and community development in 2002. He received a juris doctor from University of Maryland School of Law in 2006. At the University of Maryland School of Law, he served as an Associate Editor of The University of Maryland Journal of Race, Religion, Gender, and Class, and research assistant to then-Professor Tom Perez. Following his graduation, he was hired by Prince George's County, Maryland, first working as a law clerk and later as an assistant state's attorney. McDuffie later worked for Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton in both her local constituent services office and Capitol Hill office, where he drafted legislation. In 2008, he served as a trial lawyer in the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. In 2010, McDuffie became a policy advisor to Public Safety and Justice Deputy Mayor Paul Quander, serving as a liaison to public safety agencies. He has also served as president of the Stronghold Civic Association. ==Political career2010 election=== In February 2010, McDuffie resigned from his position in the mayor's administration and declared his candidacy to represent Ward 5 on the Council of the District of Columbia. McDuffie supported expanding employment opportunities and tackling HIV. He criticized incumbent Harry Thomas Jr. for being reactive rather than proactive. During his campaign, McDuffie stressed several urgent problems in the ward, including lack of quality education, lack of effective job-training programs, lack of affordable housing, and a need for more services for senior citizens. Thomas won the Democratic Party primary election and went on to win the general election as well. ===2012 election=== In January 2012, Thomas resigned from the Council and pleaded guilty to two federal crimes, theft and filing three years of false tax returns. McDuffie confirmed that he would run in a special election to fill the vacancy represent Ward 5 in the Council. McDuffie said that programs such as affordable housing should receive additional funding before other programs such as establishing a streetcar system and expanding the Capital Bikeshare program. McDuffie supported community-oriented, responsible and sustainable development. He was in favor of the District's program providing health insurance coverage to residents, regardless of legal status in the country, who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to be able to afford private insurance. McDuffie believed the District's summer-jobs program should be changed so that only teenagers from low-income families would be eligible. He did not support requiring some charter schools in Ward 5 to have a neighborhood admissions preference to assure some seats to local residents because it would restrict the schools' flexibility. Councilmember Tommy Wells endorsed McDuffie for his progressive agenda and emphasis on good government. The District's firefighter union, the Service Employees International Union Maryland and DC State Council, the National Nurses United union, the Local 25 Hospitality Workers' Union, the AFL-CIO, the DC Latino Caucus, and the Gertrude Stein Club also endorsed McDuffie's candidacy. Meanwhile, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 20 endorsed Delano Hunter, and The Washington Post endorsed Tim Day. McDuffie won the special election, receiving 43 percent of the votes. His term ended 2014. ===2014 election=== McDuffie ran for re-election in the 2014 election and won the primary against Kathy Henderson, Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for Carver Langston; and Carolyn C. Steptoe, Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for Brookland.. Libertarian Preston Cornish is the only candidate who opposed him in the General Election. He was re-elected with 83.93% of the vote. ==Committees== McDuffie currently serves on the following committees: * Committee on Business and Economic Development (Chair) * Committee on Transportation and the Environment * Committee on Finance and Revenue * Committee on Labor and Workforce Development ==Personal life== McDuffie lives on North Capitol Street with his wife, Princess, and his daughters, Jozi and Kesi. ==Election history== 2010 Council of the District of Columbia, Ward 5, Democratic Party Primary Election { Harry Tommy Thomas Jr. (D) 62% - Delano Hunter (D) 19% - Kenyan McDuffie (D) 15% - Tracey D.

She has produced works on the English nobility, the history of medicine and the history of breakfast. Her first work, The Knife Man, was adapted as a TV pilot by AMC but did not go further. Her second book, Wedlock, is currently being optioned for TV. ==Career== Moore graduated from Harlow College (then Harlow Technical College), and took her first job at a newspaper at 19 in Buckinghamshire. She later became a crime reporter, investigating incidents such as the Dennis Nilsen murders, as well as a health reporter. ===Health and medical writing=== Her work in researching medical topics soon interested her in the health field as well as the history of medicine; she dedicated the rest of her career to writing about medical topics. Moore became the news editor of Health Service Journal, a publication produced by the British National Health Service. In 1991, she left the Journal to become a freelance journalist, producing works for The Times, The Guardian, The Observer, and the Sunday Telegraph. She also contributed her writings to the British Medical Journal and History Today. In 1999, Moore earned a diploma in the history of medicine from the Society of Apothecaries and received the Maccabean prize for best dissertation. Her biography of 18th-century Scottish surgeon John Hunter was published as her first book, The Knife Man, in 2005. The book received positive reviews and was awarded the 2005 Medical Journalists Open Book Award. As of 2012, The Knife Man was being adapted by A History of Violence director David Cronenberg as his first television credit. ===Wedlock=== Wedlock, her second book, was published in 2009, and detailed the abusive second marriage of Mary Eleanor Bowes, Countess of Strathmore, great-great-great-great-grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II. Bowes' second husband, an Irish soldier who conned her into matrimony and then pursued her after their separation, is said to have inspired Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon. The Washington Post columnist Jonathan Yardley stated that Moore \\"writes lively and literate prose... She has done a heroic amount of research, bringing her characters to life with singular verisimilitude and portraying 18th-century courtship and marriage in full detail, never forgetting that although Mary Eleanor Bowes was uncommonly privileged and wealthy, at root her lot was that of every other woman of her day.\\" Describing the book as \\"meticulously researched\\", The Guardians Katie Toms believed it was \\"ripe for film adaptation.\\" Wedlock was also reviewed by The Independent, The Daily Telegraph, and The New York Times, among others. The book was featured on Channel 4's book club in 2010, and received a sales boost. ===How to Create the Perfect Wife=== Her subsequent book, published by Orion in 2013, was How to Create the Perfect Wife. It details the life of Sabrina Sidney, a girl who is said to have inspired the storyline of My Fair Lady. It was described in one review as 'bringing together painstaking research with gripping storytelling.' ==Personal life== Moore was born in Derbyshire. She lives in southeast London with her journalist husband and two children. She has cited The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe as the biggest literary influence on her as a child. She has also read Philip Pullman's Northern Lights trilogy. Moore is a fan of historical fiction, and lists Jean Plaidy's Madonna of the Seven Hills as one of the first books she purchased. ==Works== * * (US) or (UK) * ==References== Category:Living people Category:Historians of Europe Category:English medical historians Category:British women historians Category:People from Derbyshire Category:Alumni of Harlow College Category:1958 births ","title":"Wendy Moore"},{"id":"35844656","text":"Daniel Richard Cooper (1881-1923) was a convicted New Zealand baby farmer and illegal abortionist. In 1922, he was apprehended at a Wellington suburban property and in 1923 found guilty of murder and executed. His wife Martha Elizabeth Cooper was acquitted as being under his influence. ==Early Life (1881-1918)== Daniel Cooper was born to Elizabeth Ure and George Cooper, in Burns, Otago on 18 October 1881. Later in life, he became a builder, although he experienced two periods of contact with the police over theft- once in Oamaru in 1902, and again in Palmerston North in 1907. By 1907, he had settled in Awamangu, Otago and married Marion Burns. The couple were itinerant and shifted to New Plymouth and then Gore, Southland, in 1916. By then, Daniel had joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church and sold a booklet entitled The Practical Guide to Good Health. Tragedy struck when Marion died on 18 July 1917, in her eighth month of pregnancy. Although the initial diagnosis was pericarditis, the New Zealand Police reinvestigated the case in 1923, after Daniel Cooper was apprehended for suspected murder. Family friends expressed doubt about the circumstances of Marion's death; given that she was being treated for goitre with mercuric iodide, some argued that it was possible that he had intentionally overdosed his first wife with that medication \\"Indicted for Murder\\" New Zealand Truth: 17 March 1923 ==\\"The Newlands Baby Farmer\\" Trial (1922) and Execution (1923)== Given suspicions about his extracurricular activities occasioned by the death of his wife and other rumoured activities, Daniel Cooper was expelled from the Seventh-day Adventist Church of New Zealand on 2 January 1918, shortly after he had married his second wife, Martha (born 20 December 1893), a former book purchaser. Those rumoured activities may have included illegal abortion procedures. Daniel and Martha Cooper relocated one more time, to Newlands, a Wellington suburb, and set up an office in Lambton Quay, Wellington for their health activities in 1921. They ran a rest care and convalescent home for women, but the police raided the facility on 3 December 1922. The bodies of two newborn infants were found and Daniel and Martha were charged with murder, although Martha was later acquitted of any crime, given that there was no evidence that she had directly assisted her husband in his activities. The trial of the \\"Newlands Baby Farmer\\" was then undertaken. Mary MacLeod, a former rest home occupant, came forth with a story about her pregnancy, which had started in February 1922. Given that MacLeod was a single woman, there would have been considerable social stigma attached to any pregnancy and childbirth. The Coopers allowed her to live at the care facility and promised her that her baby would be 'adopted' by an alleged Palmerston North adoptive parental couple. On 12 October 1922 MacLeod gave birth to a daughter and was later told that the child had been adopted by the aforementioned Palmerston North family. However, the infant had died and was buried elsewhere on the Newlands property, until it was discovered by police.C.A. Treadwell: Notable New Zealand Trials: New Plymouth: 1936 Like Minnie Dean almost thirty years beforehand, Daniel Cooper was sentenced to death for his murder of the two infants. He was held in custody at Terrace Gaol in Wellington and executed there on 17 March 1923.\\"Death pays all debts\\" New Zealand Truth: 26 May 1923 His wife changed her name to Stewart, remarried and ultimately resettled in Christchurch, where she died in 1975. ==See also== *Minnie Dean, also executed for baby farming in 1895. ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1923 deaths Category:People from Otago Category:People executed for murder Category:People executed by New Zealand by hanging Category:Executed New Zealand people Category:Executed serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:People convicted of murder by New Zealand Category:New Zealand murderers of children Category:New Zealand people convicted of murder Category:New Zealand serial killers Category:People disfellowshipped by the Seventh-day Adventist Church Category:20th-century executions by New Zealand ","title":"Daniel Cooper (murderer)"},{"id":"35844672","text":"William \\"Bucky\\" McCullough commemorated on a mural in the lower Shankill William \\"Bucky\\" McCullough (1949 ‚Äì 16 October 1981) was a Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary with the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). McCullough was a leading member of the UDA's West Belfast Brigade, holding the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, until 1981 when he was killed by the republican Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). ==UDA activity== A native of the Shankill Road area of Belfast, McCullough joined the UDA at its inception in 1971. Within the UDA he garnered an early reputation as a ruthless gunman and was frequently questioned by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) over his involvement in killings and bomb attacks, albeit without being charged. One of the most notorious incidents that he was held responsible for was a grenade attack on the Gem Bar in the Catholic New Lodge area.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 377 He was a close ally of Charles Harding Smith and supported him during the brief period that Smith took the West Belfast brigade out of the mainstream UDA.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 105 McCullough was married to Barbara with whom he had six children, the youngest of which, Alan, would also become a leading member of the West Belfast UDA.Family fears for fate of missing loyalist The couple also had four daughters and another son Kenny.'Death threats' to loyalist's family McCullough was a leading figure within the West Belfast Brigade and was part of the Inner Circle of the brigade, which contained those who were close to Brigadier Tommy Lyttle. McCullough was particularly close to James Craig who was in charge of fundraising for the Brigade and who also maintained a series of shadowy links to some republican figures. In the mid-1970s McCullough was one of four UDA members to accompany Craig to a meeting with five leading members of the Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) at the Royal Bar, Ann Street in Belfast city centre at which they concluded a series of agreements not to target each other's members and not to get in the way of each other's rackets. All of the republicans present, with whom Craig remained in contact, switched allegiance to the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) soon after the meeting.Martin Dillon, The Dirty War, Arrow Books, 1990, p. 446 ===Clash with Craig=== Like Craig, who was notorious for his gangsterism, McCullough was involved in racketeering on behalf of the UDA although the money he secured from his rackets was passed on to the UDA's military wing the \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" (UFF) to purchase weapons. This was often not the case with Craig, who enriched himself personally through the rackets he ran.Dillon, The Dirty War, p. 447 According to Martin Dillon McCullough discovered that Craig was enriching himself through a number of extortion rackets, the proceeds of which were supposed to go to the upkeep of the UDA in West Belfast. When McCullough began to raise his suspicions Craig decided to set him up to silence him.Martin Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, Routledge, 1999, pp. 264‚Äì265 McCullough further heard that money set aside for loyalist prisoners had been taken by Craig and when Craig was briefly in custody on extortion charges McCullough publicly spoke of telling UFF commander John McMichael about Craig's activity.Martin Dillon, The Trigger Men, Mainstream Publishing, 2003, p. 98 ==Death== Upon being informed of McCullough's accusations and his demands for an internal inquiry into the finances of the West Belfast Brigade Craig decided to have McCullough killed. He discounted having the popular Lieutenant-Colonel killed by a UDA member and instead made contact with his friends in the INLA, telling them that McCullough was a leading figure in UFF sectarian killings.Dillon, The Dirty War, pp. 447‚Äì448 McCullough was shot and killed at his home on Denmark Street on the lower Shankill on 16 October 1981. Preparing to drive one of his daughters to school, a motorcycle drove up and the pillion passenger opened fire as McCullough was getting into his car. He was shot twelve times and despite medical attention died a few minutes later. His youngest son Alan was three months old at the time of McCullough's death.Ian S. Wood, Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 301 McCullough was living only a few doors away from West Belfast Brigadier Tommy Lyttle at the time.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 119 Robbie McAllister, an INLA \\"supergrass\\", would later claim that Lyttle had been the actual target that day, although in fact the INLA had been tracking McCullough's movements for some time using Craig's information.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 391 According to McAllister's testimony they had watched McCullough through binoculars from the flat of Emmanuel Conway, who lived in the republican Unity Flats area adjacent to the lower Shankill. Ironically enough Conway had been one of the OIRA members to attend the Royal Bar meeting before switching to the INLA.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald, INLA ‚Äì Deadly Divisions, Torc, 1994, p. 192 McAllister then claimed that he rode on a motorcycle from the Unity Flats with another INLA member, a fellow Markets man identified only as \\"Bronco\\", riding pillion and that when they reached Denmark Street Bronco dismounted and fired several shots into McCullough's car.Holland & McDonald, INLA, pp. 192‚Äì193 The pair then rode off as far as the area close to Divis Flats at the bottom of the Falls Road where the motorcycle broke down. McAllister added that he only learned McCullough's name on the radio due to Lyttle being the target.Holland & McDonald, INLA, p. 193 In November 1985 McAllister was sentenced to a total of 766 years in prison for his role in several killings, including that of McCullough.Holland & McDonald, INLA, p. 200 ===Aftermath=== Craig himself was eventually killed by the Ulster Freedom Fighters in 1988 in an attack that was publicly blamed on his role in setting up the murder of UDA South Belfast Brigadier and UFF commander John McMichael. Privately however it was held that Craig had played a similar role in the killing of McCullough, as well as Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leaders Lenny Murphy, John Bingham and William Marchant.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, p. 266 Tommy McCreery, a relative of East Belfast Brigadier Ned McCreery and a former associate of Craig and McCullough who was also at the Royal Bar meeting, told an internal UDA inquiry held after Craig's death that Craig had set up McCullough with the INLA and that he had informed Andy Tyrie shortly before Craig was killed.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 406 McCullough's death would see him feted as a loyalist hero.David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and C Company, Mainstream Publishing, 2004, p. 335 At a time when the West Belfast Brigade was stagnating there was no direct retaliation attack. A young member, Gary Smyth, suggested driving up the republican Falls Road and opening fire on people waiting at a bus stop but his superiors vetoed the idea, leading to Smyth leaving the UDA.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 152 McCullough was given a full UDA funeral and was buried with a scarf and rosette of Liverpool F.C., of whom he was a supporter.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, Mainstream Publishing, 2008, p. 883 McCullough is commemorated on a mural close to his home on Denmark Street.William McCullough Mural A UDA statement in 2003, released after the killing of Alan McCullough by UDA members, stated that \\"Bucky McCullough is a loyalist icon and very much revered within the loyalist community\\".UDA: Murdered chief was a spy ==References== Category:1949 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Ulster Defence Association members Category:UDA C Company members Category:People killed by the Irish National Liberation Army Category:People from Belfast Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland ","title":"William McCullough (loyalist)"},{"id":"35844675","text":"William McCullough may refer to: * William McCullough (loyalist) (1949‚Äì1981), Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary with the Ulster Defence Association * William McCullough (Northern Ireland politician) (1901-1967), Northern Irish communist and trade unionist * William McCullough (politician) (1843‚Äì1925), New Zealand politician * Billy McCullough (born 1935), Northern Irish footballer ","title":"William McCullough"},{"id":"35844676","text":"Brad Herman is a former American football tight end.

Through his positions with the American Colony and Palestine Archaeological Museum, he used photography as a means of recording the history of Christian Palestinian culture as well as the discovery of past cultures in the region. He had a significant impact on the techniques of archeological photographers, especially those who took pictures of the Dead Sea Scrolls, through his contributions to the use of infrared photography. ==Early life== Najib was born the son of Anton Albina and Victoria Safieh, on 2 January 1901 in Jerusalem, Palestine. Both of his parents were of Christian Palestinian descent. He was one of three brothers and one sister. His father, Anton, went missing in action in 1918 during a World War I campaign.

In addition, the photographs were taken on animal skin, and allowed the text to stand out, making the plates especially useful for assembling fragments.

During the process, Najib recorded his progress and work with the scrolls in a log book, still held today by the Israel Antiquities Authority. In addition to photographing the fragments and scrolls of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection for the PAM, Najib took other photographs for the museum. This included, but was not limited to, site photographs. Many of the site photographs for the Dead Sea Scrolls were referenced by notations of the film plates that Najib put together for the museum.

Palestinian Arabs attacked the museum and attempted to loot some of the contents, putting Najib at gunpoint to unlock the glass plates behind which the Dead Sea Scrolls were stored. He lied, said he did not have the keys, and noted that he himself was Arab. After being held for three days, he was released.

He declined both in protest to the change in national management of the museum and because there were significant restrictions on his family's living conditions in Jerusalem. ==Later life== Najib had seven children ‚Äì five girls and two boys: Lillan, Lima, Lorraine, Lucy, Vicky, Issa, and Joseph. After Najib's exile to the United States, just before the beginning of the Six-Day War, he settled in Los Angeles, California.

However, as part of the agreement with the Palestine Archaeological Museum, he had already turned over the photographs, negatives, and photographic equipment, as they were museum property.

Index entries derived from digital copies of original records.), \\"The Crafty Texan\\", was an African American boxer who fought professionally out of Chicago from 1892 to 1911 and twice held the World Colored Heavyweight Championship. Fighting at a weight of between 160 and 185 lbs., the short, stocky Childs fought middleweights, light-heavyweights and heavyweights. He had a powerful punch. ==Journeyman== He made his pro boxing debut on February 18, 1892 in Los Angeles against French Canadian George LaBlanche from Quebec, knocking him out in the third round. They fought again on March 24, with four-ounce gloves. In the eighth round, LaBlanche grabbed Childs by the waist, threw him to the canvas, and then kicked him. The badly hurt Childs got up and wrestled LaBlanche, putting him in a half-nelson before elevating LaBlanche and throwing him. The police stopped the fight and the referee awarded Childs the decision after disqualifying LaBlanche. Childs fought 15 more bouts before getting a shot at the colored heavyweight title. Along the way, he fought Bob Armstrong, the colored heavyweight champ, in a six-round non-title contest held on March 7, 1897 in Philadelphia. Childs won on points. His fight before that had been with white heavyweight contender Joe Choynski (the mentor of future colored heavyweight and world heavyweight title-holder Jack Johnson), who won by knockout (K.O.) in the third of a three-round fight. In the intervening thirteen months before Armstrong gave him a shot for the title, Childs squared off on January 8, 1898 at Chicago's 2nd Regiment Armory against a boxer named Klondike (real name John Haines or John W. Haynes), so called because he was supposed to be a great find (evoking the Klondike Gold Rush). It was Klondike's first fight, and he was K.O.-ed by Childs. Klondike would go on to beat future world heavyweight champ Jack Johnson in Johnson's third pro fight and claim what he called the \\"Black Heavyweight Championship\\". Childs and Klondike would meet again, frequently, as African American boxers were forced to fight one another often due to the color bar. ==World Colored Heavyweight Champ== Childs first fought for the World Colored Heavyweight crown on January 29, 1898, knocking out colored champion Bob Armstrong in the second round. On February 26, he defended the title against Klondike on a technical knock-out in the fourth round of a scheduled six-round bout. In another six-round defense held in Chicago on June 3, he retained the title by drawing with Charley Strong, who had fought Armstrong for the title vacated by Peter Jackson. In his next fight on September 4 of that year, he lost the title to George Byers on points in a 20-rounder. Regardless of losing the title, Childs fought Armstrong again on March 4, 1899 in Cincinnati, Ohio in a fight announced as a title bout, despite Byers being the legitimate champion. Childs defeated Armstrong via a TKO in the sixth round of a 10-round bout. On August 11, 1899, he won the \\"Black Heavyweight Championship\\" claimed by Klondike Haynes in a six-round contest in Chicago by outpointing the so-called \\"Black Hercules\\". On October 28 of that year, they met in a rematch in Chicago in which Childs retained the black heavyweight title by kayoing Haynes in the third round of a six-round contest. On March 16, 1900, Childs put his black heavyweight title on the line and Byers put up his coloured heavyweight crown in a six-round bout that ended in a draw. He next fought Joe Butler on December 15, 1900 for the black heavyweight title, dispatching Butler via KO in the sixth. Finally, he took back the Coloured World Heavyweight Championship legitimately from Byers on March 16, 1901 in Hot Springs, Arkansas, kayoing him in the 17th round of a 20-round fight. (He did not put up his black heavyweight title, which he never claimed again.) He lost the coloured heavyweight title to Denver Ed Martin in a bout in Chicago on February 25, 1902, being out-pointed in a six-round contest. Not one to surrender a title easily, he billed his October 9, 1902 fight with Joe Walcott as a defence of his coloured heavyweight title. He beat Walcott via a TKO in the 3rd round when Walcott quit, claiming that he was injured. Childs was winning the fight at the time. ==Requiem for a Heavyweight== Jack Johnson eliminated any pretensions Childs had to the colored crown when he beat him via TKO in the 12th round of a fight on October 21, 1902 in Los Angeles. Childs's corner claimed he dislocated his elbow. He lost to Joe Choynski on December 1, 1902, being outpointed in a six-rounder. After a 16-month lay-off, he beat Chicago Jack Johnson (not the future champion) on successive days in March 1904, knocking him out in the 2nd both times. The real Jack Johnson had won the colored heavyweight title from Denver Ed Martin on February 5, 1903, and June 2, 1904 in Chicago, the two champs, the reigning champion and the two-time former champion, met in a six-round bout. Johnson won on points. He met up with old adversary Klondike Haynes on July 7 of that year and KO'd him in the 8th. There was no talk of championships, colored or black. Jack Johnson was the champ. After losing on points to Denver Ed Martin in a six-rounder on November 1, he retired. He came back six years later and fought tyro light- heavyweight Horace \\"Jack\\" Taylor on February 2, 1911. The six-round bout, Taylor's second pro fight, resulted in a draw. ==Record== In a career that stretched from 1892 to 1911, he racked up a career record of 41 wins (25 by knockout) against nine losses (being KO-ed three times) and eight draws. ==Legacy & Honors== In 2020 award-winning author Mark Allen Baker published the first comprehensive account of The World Colored Heavyweight Championship, 1876-1937, with McFarland & Company, a leading independent publisher of academic & nonfiction books. This history traces the advent and demise of the Championship, the stories of the talented professional athletes who won it, and the demarcation of the color line both in and out of the ring. For decades the World Colored Heavyweight Championship was a useful tool to combat racial oppression-the existence of the title a leverage mechanism, or tool, used as a technique to counter a social element, ‚Äúdrawing the color line.‚Äù ==References== Category:1867 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Boxers from Alabama Category:Boxers from Texas Category:Boxers from Illinois Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:African-American boxers Category:World colored heavyweight boxing champions Category:American male boxers ","title":"Frank Childs"},{"id":"35844827","text":"Yangjiazhuang may refer to the following locations in China: * Yangjiazhuang, Laiyuan County (Êù®ÂÆ∂Â∫ÑÈïá), town in Hebei * Yangjiazhuang, Fenyang (Êù®ÂÆ∂Â∫ÑÈïá), town in Shanxi * Yangjiazhuang Township, Hebei (Êù®ÂÆ∂Â∫Ñ‰π°), in Dingzhou * Yangjiazhuang Township, Shanxi (Êù®ÂÆ∂Â∫Ñ‰π°), in Jiaoqu, Yangquan ","title":"Yangjiazhuang"},{"id":"35844916","text":" HMAS Siesta was a channel patrol boat operated by the Naval Auxiliary Patrol of the Royal Australian Navy during World War II.

It is found in bacterial sensor and chemotaxis proteins and in eukaryotic histidine kinases. The bacterial proteins are usually integral membrane proteins and part of a two-component signal transduction pathway. One or several copies of the HAMP domain can be found in association with other domains, such as the histidine kinase domain, the bacterial chemotaxis sensory transducer domain, the PAS repeat, the EAL domain, the GGDEF domain, the protein phosphatase 2C-like domain, the guanylate cyclase domain, or the response regulatory domain. In its most common setting, the HAMP domain transmits conformational changes in periplasmic ligand-binding domains to cytoplasmic signalling kinase and methyl-acceptor domains and thus regulates the phosphorylation or methylation activity of homodimeric receptors. == References == Category:Protein families ","title":"HAMP domain"},{"id":"35844948","text":"Aneika A.

She was one of thirteen similar vessels, known to Sydneysiders as the 'Hollywood Fleet'. Silver Cloud was a 65 ft cruiser built in 1939 by Lars Halvorsen and Sons. At the time she was launched, she was the third Silver Cloud built for Jack Bruce, cousin of Stanley M Bruce, former Prime Minister and later Australia‚Äôs High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. She was requisitioned and later commissioned by the RAN on 21 July 1941 under the command of Lieutenant R E Breydon, RANR. She was armed with Vickers machine guns fore and aft and depth charge racks on the stern. During the Battle of Sydney Harbour (often referred to as the Attack on Sydney Harbour), on 31 May and 1 June 1942, Silver Cloud remained moored to the wharf in Rushcutters Bay. Whilst the RAN Sea Power Centre histories record her being employed on patrol duties of the swept channels to seaward of Sydney, and on patrol duties on the NSW coast, there is no record in the Sydney Log of Silver Cloud leaving Sydney after the Battle of Sydney Harbour. In 1978 when discussing the Battle of Sydney Harbour, Reg Andrew (former commander of HMAS Seamist) said Silver Cloud rarely ‚Äòever‚Äô went on patrol as she was for ‚Äòbase duties and VIP cruisers‚Äô. On 12 July 1943 whilst getting underway at Hunters Bay, Sydney Harbour, Silver Cloud was consumed by fire. She was towed to the nearby wharf at HMAS Penguin where the local fire brigade was able to extinguish the fire, however the fire destroyed a large portion of the vessel to the waterline. A proposal was considered by the RAN for her to be re-built as a stores vessels, however, this was rejected and the remaining hull was sold to Lars Halvorsen and Sons. Halvorsens subsequently re-built her. She remains afloat (May 2020) and in use. == Notes References== *Blunt, William; Lolita and the Hollywood Fleet, First Edition, May 2020. * Category:1933 ships Category:Patrol vessels of the Royal Australian Navy Category:Maritime incidents in July 1943 ","title":"HMAS Silver Cloud"},{"id":"35845095","text":"FRLA may refer to: *Fritz Reuter Literary Archive, an institution in Berlin, Germany that collects autographs and manuscripts by 19th century authors from Mecklenburg *Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946, a statute enacted by the United States Congress to reduce the influence of lobbyists *Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site, a United States National Historic Site located in Brookline, Massachusetts *Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association ","title":"FRLA"},{"id":"35845108","text":" HMAS Sirocco (Q21) was a channel patrol boat operated by the Naval Auxiliary Patrol of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) during World War II.

He also stated, \\"The Salafis are like kittens when they are weak, but when they are strong they become like tigers.\\".http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle- East/2008/0924/p06s03-wome.html/%28page%29/2 During the 2011-2012 Syrian Uprising, he accused anti-Syrian groups in Lebanon, such as the Future Movement, of funding and equipping Islamists in Tripoli. He believes the Alawites in Lebanon are attacked in revenge for events in Syria, and that the Syrian army can protect Lebanese Alawites against attacks from armed Islamists, since the Lebanese army is ineffective against them. On 10 April 2014, an indictment had demanded the death penalty for Rifaat Eid and three senior Jabal Mohsen fighters. Eid's pro-Damascus Arab Democratic Party, the main faction in Jabal Mohsen, participated in more than 20 rounds of deadly sectarian fighting with gunmen from the neighboring Bab al-Tabbaneh district between 2008 and 2014. Eid had fled the country to Syrian city of Tartous to avoid legal charges, and is still living there.http://yalibnan.com/2015/12/26/fugitive-ali-eid-died-in-syria-and- buried-in-lebanon/http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon- News/2014/Mar-31/251756-adp-denies-rifaat-and-ali-eid-fled-to-syria.ashx ==See also== *Lebanese Civil War *North Lebanon clashes (2014) *2nd Infantry Brigade (Lebanon) ==References== Category:Arab Democratic Party (Lebanon) politicians Category:Leaders of political parties Category:Lebanese Alawites Category:Lebanese Arab nationalists Category:Living people Category:1977 births Category:People from Tripoli District ","title":"Rifaat Eid"},{"id":"35845175","text":"Mittonia is a genus of snout moths described by Paul Ernest Sutton Whalley in 1964. ==Species== * Mittonia carcassoni Whalley, 1964 * Mittonia hampsoni (Distant, 1897) ==References== Category:Pyralinae Category:Pyralidae genera ","title":"Mittonia"},{"id":"35845188","text":"In mathematics applied to computer graphics, nearest neighbor value interpolation is an advanced method of image interpolation.

He was born on July 27, 1927 in Spokane, Washington. == Education and Teaching == He attended Yale School of Music to study piano, but did not finish his degree. He moved to New York City and worked for Harper's Magazine but later returned to Spokane where he attended Eastern Washington College of Education and received his B.A. in Art Education in 1957. After receiving his degree, he taught art at a local public school for two years. He moved to Michigan to pursue an M.F.A at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. He had a major in painting and a ceramics minor. After graduating, he stayed at Cranbrook working at Young People's Art Center (1958 - 1965). He taught at both Wayne State University (1966-1968) and the University of Windsor (1970 -1971). Michaels' early ambition was to become a cartoonist and during his time at Yale he was able to pursue it. He work was published in both the Yale Daily News and the Yale RecordThe Yale Record (\\"Smut!\\" Issue). New Haven: Yale Record. February, 1951. p. 3.. He eventually published a book, Oh! You're a musician : a book of cartoons(1951). He was encouraged by Mary Petty and Alan Dunn to seek cartooning and illustration work. He left Yale in the summer of 1952, moving to New York City. He found there was a market for his illustrations, but with little financial success. \\"I realized that the field of art needed an education, so I must go back to school. So at twenty-six I started all over again.\\" He moved back to Spokane to attend Eastern Washington College of Education. Basalt columns on Meany Crest, Mount Rainier National Park, U.S.A. == Influences == Michaels speaks how landscape of the Pacific Northwest, especially the basalt columns can be seen in his sculptures. He works usually include chipped tiles that echo these rock formations. The influence of the art and calligraphy of Japan is also visible. He spent two months there, including a few weeks staying at a Zen temple. He was entranced by their gardens, how the manicured gardens blended perfectly into the wild. Both influences found their way into the site specific screen he created for the Frank Lloyd Wright Bloomfield Hills, Michigan Melvyn Maxwell and Sara Stein Smith House. == Artwork == Early in his career his work was shown at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York City (October 3-22, 1960 and January 2-20, 1962). His work was well reviewed in the New York Times by art critic John Canaday (January 7, 1962). Michaels was featured at the opening night event for the 1968 Museum of Contemporary Crafts exhibition \\"Objects Are...?\\". \\"The invitation requested that attendees bring with them an object ‚Äì ‚Äúlarger or smaller than a breadbox, anything from a paper clip to a barn door‚Äù ‚Äì as their ticket to admission. These objects became part of an object collage produced on the spot by ‚Äúmaster assembler‚Äù artist Glen Michaels\\". Michaels was singled out in a New Yorker Talk of the Town feature by George W. S. Trow. His work installations include the Bricktown Station (Detroit People Mover) Bricktown Station, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the IMF in Washington, D.C. and the Ford Motor Company 1964 New York World's Fair exhibit (now installed in the Henry Ford Centennial Library). Mr. Michaels was honored and exhibited at the Scarab Club in Detroit, at the time of his 90th birthday. In 2017, Mr. Michaels was asked by the Downtown NewsMagazine to name his favorite sculpture. He replied, ‚ÄúWhatever is the most recent is always my favorite.‚Äù Michaels was amused when his friend, author Elmore Leonard, used his name as a character in this novel Out of Sight.

It was Reagan's fifth State of the Union Address and his sixth speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, Tip O'Neill, accompanied by George H. W. Bush, the Vice President of the United States. Economic growth, increased job opportunities, and falling inflation rates were among some of the key issues discussed in this address. Reagan advocated for both an increase in national defense and a reevaluation of the federal budget, arguing the importance of national security and economic stability by appealing to American family values. In addition, the speech addressed welfare issues and proposed that new programs be created to support poor families. Reagan also asked that he be given the authority of a line-item veto. The speech lasted approximately 31 minutes and contained 3,514 words. The address was broadcast live on radio and television. This was the first State of the Union Address to have been postponed from its original date. Reagan planned to give his address on Tuesday, January 28, 1986, but after learning of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, he postponed it for a week and addressed the nation on the day's events. Reagan delivered a much shorter address to the nation, focused solely upon the tragic events of the Challenger disaster, which served as an explanation for the delay of the speech. Reagan justified this delay by stating that ‚Äútoday is a day for mourning and remembering,‚Äù inviting the nation to devote the day to recognizing what he defined as ‚Äútruly a national loss.‚Äù As a continuation of the tradition President Reagan started at the delivery of his State of the Union Address in 1982, he invited hand-selected special guests to be present during the speech. These four guests included Tyrone Ford, a 12-year-old with a talent in gospel music, 13-year-old Trevor Ferrell, who took an initiative to support the homeless, 13-year-old Shelby Butler, who risked her own life to save a classmate from oncoming traffic, and Richard Cavoli, a student of science who had designed an experiment that had been carried aboard Space Shuttle Challenger. These four guests were chosen because President Reagan saw them as everyday examples of young heroes in America. Each of these individuals was mentioned directly during the speech. The Democratic Party response was delivered by Senator George Mitchell (ME), Lt. Gov. Harriett Woods (MO), Gov. Charles Robb (VA), Rep. Thomas Daschle (SD), and Rep. William Gray (PA), who had previously taken part in the group response to President Reagan's State of the Union Address delivered on January 25, 1984. ==See also== *Speeches and debates of Ronald Reagan *1986 United States House of Representatives elections ==References * (full transcript), The American Presidency Project, UC Santa Barbara. * Full video and audio, Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia. * 1986 State of the Union Address (video) at C-SPAN Category:State of the Union addresses State union 1986 Category:99th United States Congress State of the Union Address State of the Union Address State of the Union Address State of the Union Address Category:February 1986 events in the United States Category:Space Shuttle Challenger disaster ","title":"1986 State of the Union Address"},{"id":"35845275","text":"Shauntia Latrice \\"Tia\\" Norfleet (born May 1, 1986 in Suffolk, Virginia) is an American drag racing and stock car racing driver.

Norfleet claims her racing career began at age 14, when she began competing in kart racing events; she went on to attempt a career in drag racing at the local and regional level. In 2000, Norfleet switched to entry level spec racing competing in Bandolero cars, then moving to late model stock car racing on short tracks starting with the 2004 racing season; she became the first female African-American driver to purchase a NASCAR Late Model Series racing license. Norfleet attended local late model events at tracks near her Augusta, Georgia home, starting her Late Model career in 2004. She claimed to begin competing in NASCAR national touring series competition starting in the summer of 2012, and was operating a grassroots funding initiative, claiming it would finance her racing career; however she did not make it to the track in a major series in 2012. ==Controversy== In March 2013, a New York Times article reported that there were numerous inconsistencies in Norfleet's self-promotion efforts. They observe that she has only raced in one low level event, where she ran one lap before parking her car. She also has several criminal offenses on her record, and according to public records is actually 26 years old, not 24 as she has claimed; in addition, the NASCAR license that she has received, which she claimed was the first to be received by an African-American woman, is a kind that any driver who wishes to acquire is able to purchase. Suggesting that she is making an effort to subvert the sport's development process, NASCAR's vice president for public affairs has said, ‚ÄúI am uncomfortable with Tia representing herself in the way that she has.‚Äù Norfleet responded that the accusations were \\"a biased, smear campaign\\". Her father responded to the allegations by calling them a \\"witchhunt\\", by posting pictures of Tia's name on four separate licenses, and refuting some of the allegations. Tia confirmed that she did indeed have a criminal record, and that her only NASCAR event was indeed a \\"start and park\\", but also stated that she had never claimed to be a Nationwide Series driver even though she was shown with a NNS patch on her firesuit. ==Charitable work== Norfleet supports the Safe Teen Georgia Driving Academy program, providing driving instruction at Atlanta Motor Speedway on behalf of the group; in addition she is an ambassador for Safe America Driving. ==References * Category:Living people Category:1986 births Category:Sportspeople from Suffolk, Virginia Category:Racing drivers from Virginia Category:African-American racing drivers Category:American female racing drivers Category:Female dragster drivers Category:NASCAR drivers Category:Dragster drivers ","title":"Tia Norfleet"},{"id":"35845283","text":"Wuzhi (; died 685 BC), also called Gongsun Wuzhi (ÂÖ¨Â≠´ÁÑ°Áü•, Gongsun meaning grandson of a duke), was for a few months in early 685 BC ruler of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China.

The foundational premise of the network is that human beings' true qualities can only be known as they are expressed in practical daily living. The mission of Emissaries of Divine Light, as cited in its articles of incorporation, is to assist in the spiritual regeneration of humanity under the inspiration of the divine spirit. Meeker saw the work of the Emissaries as an approach to spirituality that transcends physical and mental disciplines, and offers human beings the opportunity to experience their true identity by giving expression to the qualities of spirit that are consonant with their divine nature. ==HistoryBeginnings=== Lloyd Arthur Meeker was born on February 25, 1907. Meeker had begun to experiment with Attunement in 1929. Emissaries of Divine Light dates its origin to Meeker‚Äôs spiritual awakening on September 16, 1932. On three successive evenings, Meeker had been compelled to write and, as he did so, he experienced a higher spiritual awareness that flowed through him. He reported that he had been looking for a teacher but realized through his awakening that the teacher he sought was within him. Meeker lectured, taught, and practiced Attunement in various locations in North America from 1929 to 1945. He wrote under the pen name Uranda, and he was known to his followers by that name. In 1945 Meeker established his headquarters at Sunrise Ranch, which was a dryland farm at the time. From 1952 to 1954 he conducted six-month Servers Training School classes at Sunrise Ranch, teaching Attunement and the spiritual understanding behind the practice, as well as practical spirituality. These classes were attended by people from many backgrounds, and included GPC (God-Patient-Chiropractor) chiropractors, led by a former Major League Baseball pitcher, George Shears, and others. In 1954 Meeker died in a plane crash in San Francisco Bay with his wife, Kathy Meeker. A close associate of Meeker‚Äôs, Albert Ackerley, and two children also died in the crash. Lord Martin Cecil (1909-1988), who had worked closely with Meeker, assumed the responsibility for leading Emissaries of Divine Light from 1954 until his death in 1988. Lord Martin succeeded his older brother to become The 7th Marquess of Exeter in October 1981. ===Development under Lord Martin Cecil's leadership=== Lord Martin Cecil was the second son of William Cecil, 5th Marquess of Exeter and was descended from William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, chief adviser to Queen Elizabeth I. He led a ranching operation on his family‚Äôs property in the Cariboo country of British Columbia. In 1948, Cecil formed a spiritual community at 100 Mile House, BC. On the death of his brother, David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter, in October 1981, he became The 7th Marquess of Exeter and a member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. However, he never spoke in the House.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-william-cecil-2 Under Lord Martin's leadership, the network grew to about 4,000 adherents. Many young people, disenchanted with the Vietnam War and inspired by the idealism of the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, were drawn to his message and the network that was growing around him. Twelve centers developed around the world, and numerous other nonprofit organizations were birthed by participants in Emissaries of Divine Light. These included an outdoor adventure educational organization, Educo; an association of spiritually based business people, Renaissance Business Associates; an association of media professionals, Association for Responsible Communication; an association of educators, Renaissance Educational Associates; and Emissary Foundation International. Bill Bahan became an important leader and teacher for Emissaries of Divine Light in the ‚Äô60s, ‚Äô70s and early ‚Äô80s, offering classes at Sunrise Ranch; Epping, New Hampshire; and Livingston Manor, New York. He was a nephew of George Shears, D.C., leader of the G-P-C Chiropractic Movement. He and his brother Walter Bahan (also active in the Emissary program), along with three other brothers (all five chiropractors), operated the Bahan and Bahan Chiropractic Clinics in Salem and Derry, New Hampshire, using GPC principles. Bill founded the Whole Health Institute, an association of healthcare professionals promoting wholistic health. They hosted conferences and lectures around the world, and published the journal Healing Currents. In Bill's words, \\"Health is the unhindered expression of life through the body, truth through the mind and love through the heart.\\" ===Transition after Lord Exeter's death=== When Lord Exeter died in January 1988, his son, Michael Cecil, 8th Marquess of Exeter (formerly known as Lord Burghley), became the leader of Emissaries of Divine Light until he left the organisation in 1996. In that eight-year period, much of the leadership left the organisation, including most of the children of both Lloyd Arthur Meeker and Martin Cecil, 7th Marquess of Exeter, who had been prominent in the network. From 1988 to 1996, more than two thirds of the participants in Emissaries of Divine Light left as well. Many ex-members became bitter about their experience and launched accusations against the organization. One member, Robert Coates, even began playing football in one of the group's most sacred spaces. As the 8th Marquess of Exeter resigned from his position in 1996, a group of trustees assumed responsibility for the leadership of the network. They set in place ethical guidelines throughout the network and addressed grievances brought to them by participants. They sought to bring the universal truths taught by Lloyd Arthur Meeker into contemporary language and practice. ===Recent history=== In the 1990s, Emissaries of Divine Light developed new programs for spiritual understanding and personal development. Deepening Spiritual Expression and The Opening are week-long residential programs that are still offered by the organization. They also developed Attunement Practitioner certification training, which is available at many Emissary centers. In August 2004, the trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light named David Karchere as the leader of the global network. In 2008, David Karchere and Jane Anetrini developed and taught a year-long leadership program based on the teachings of Emissaries of Divine Light. A second session of the program was conducted in 2009 and 2010. In 2012 they initiated a new series of seminars under the title Practical Spirituality: An Operator‚Äôs Guide to Being Human, led by David Karchere. ==Sunrise Ranch== The headquarters of Emissaries of Divine Light was established in 1945 at Sunrise Ranch in Loveland, Colorado, now a conference and retreat center staffed by a community of eighty-five people. Sunrise Ranch hosts workshops, seminars and retreats intended to offer the participants fresh thinking and understanding, leading to a direct experience of spiritual renewal. There are seven other major centers around the world for Emissaries of Divine Light, each offering programs with a similar approach. Sunrise Ranch also offers residential work- study programs in practical spirituality, which it defines as the application of universal spiritual principles to the common issues of human life. These include a program designed for personal spiritual renewal, called Full Self Emergence, and a Permaculture Design Course for people interested in sustainable human systems and sustainable agriculture. ==Creative Field Project== The trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light lead the Creative Field Project. The project is an exploration of the power of human intention to influence the field of energy held by a group of people. The Creative Field Project began in 2009 with a network of small groups around the world that meet monthly by telephone. It included the first Creative Field Conference in 2011 at Sunrise Ranch that featured Lynne McTaggart, who wrote The Field; and American priest and theologian Matthew Fox. In 2012, Emissaries of Divine Light joined with the Novalis Ubuntu Institute in Cape Town, South Africa, to host the Creative Field Conference‚ÄîSouth Africa: Your Destiny Is Calling. ==Teaching and practices== Emissaries of Divine Light teach that the key to creative living is the individual‚Äôs openness to the source of universal power and intelligence within them, and that human emotions either connect a person to that source or cut them off from it. The educational programs of the Emissaries are designed to assist people to find out what has been emotionally triggering them, so that they can withdraw their emotional attention from the trigger and turn it to the life force within them. The Emissaries believe that behind all emotions is the universal power of love and a universal intelligence that bring spiritual enlightenment. They teach that through deliberate conscious thought a person can let their own emotional current purify, so that they open themselves to the flow of the universal power and intelligence within them. ===The One Law=== The central teaching of Emissaries of Divine Light is referred to as The One Law. They describe it as a law of cause and effect. They see the causative factor in spiritual regeneration as the universal power and intelligence within all people, and the effect in human experience as dependent on the response to that internal reality. They describe the creative process in human experience as the working of The One Law in a sequence of five stages: radiation, response, attraction, union and unified radiation. Their seminars claim to assist people to withdraw their energetic response from the circumstances around them and direct it to the power and intelligence within them. Emissaries of Divine Light describe the process of personal spiritual renewal as Full Self Emergence because they believe that a person is renewed when their own divine selfhood expresses through their mind, emotions and their body. They use the story of the Seven Days of Creation in Genesis as a symbolic template for the process of spiritual renewal in the life of the individual, and for humankind as a whole. ===Attunement=== Attunement is a central practice of Emissaries of Divine Light. The origin of the word Attunement refers to the attuning of the human capacity with the universal animating spirit within all people. Attunement practitioners believe that positive shifts in consciousness release a healing energy through a person‚Äôs body, mind and emotions. Emissaries of Divine Light practice Attunement as a form of energy medicine. Attunement practitioners believe that universal life energy is conveyed to the client through the hands of the practitioner. The primary contact points for the client receiving the Attunement are the endocrine glands. Attunement practitioners teach that the endocrine glands are portals for universal life energy that operates through the physical body, and through the mental and emotional function of the individual. Emissaries of Divine Light also teach Attunement as a personal spiritual practice. They believe it is a central factor in the conscious evolution of humanity. ==Leadership== Emissaries of Divine Light is led by David Karchere, who is the spiritual director of the organization, and six other trustees. Karchere lives, writes and teaches at Sunrise Ranch, and travels in North America, Europe, Africa and Australia, offering programs on practical spirituality and Attunement. The trustees are elected by an International Emissary Congress with representatives from Emissary organizations around the world. Currently, the trustees are Jane Anetrini, Ruth Buckingham, Hugh Duff, David Karchere, Marilyn Manderson, Phil Richardson and Maureen Waller. ==Major centers== In addition to their international headquarters at Sunrise Ranch, Emissaries of Divine Light used to operate Glen Ivy in Corona, California, as a conference and retreat center and an Attunement teaching center. Glen Ivy is also a natural mineral springs. The Emissaries leased the mineral springs and the spa property adjacent to their center to Glen Ivy Hot Springs, a popular destination in Southern California. The property was sold in 2016. These are the major centers for Emissaries of Divine Light around the world: *Edenvale, Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada *Gate House, Constantia, South Africa *Riverdell, Gawler, South Australia, Australia *Sunrise Ranch, Loveland, Colorado, USA ==Publications== Beginning in the 1930s, Emissaries of Divine Light have continually published their writings and teachings and circulated these to their membership. In 1936, Lloyd A. Meeker published his seven-week meditation guide, Seven Steps to the Temple of Light, as well as his correspondence course, Steps to Mastership. In the 1980s, Martin Cecil published eighteen volumes of his own writing and the writings of Lloyd Meeker under the title The Third Sacred School. For most of its history, weekly talks and writings of Emissary leadership have been distributed by regular mail. Since 2005, the organization has circulated a weekly e-mail message, The Pulse of Spirit, authored by David Karchere and other current leaders of the network. In 2010 they began to publish the Journal of the Creative Field. ==References External links == Category:Spiritual organizations ","title":"Emissaries of Divine Light"},{"id":"35845304","text":"Rectiostoma fernaldella (stenomid oak leaf tier) is a species of moth in the family Depressariidae.

It is spoken by older adults, who are likewise fluent in Pashto. The Tirahis were expelled from Tirah in the present-day Khyber District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, by the Afridi Pashtuns. Georg Morgenstierne claimed that Tirahi is \\"probably the remnant of a dialect group extending from Tirah through the Peshawar district into Swat and Dir.\\" == Geographic Distribution == Spoken in the Nangarhar Province of Northeastern Afghanistan, there are about 100 native speakers today, if any. This is mainly due to the majority of the Tirahi people having assimilated into the dominant Pashtun culture of Afghanistan. In its place, Tirahi connects the Dardic languages spoken in Dardistan with languages which reach down to the mouth of the Indus River, showing Dardic influence. Thus, it could be the missing link connecting a chain of languages between the Hindu Kush and Goa. In possibly being the missing link, Dardic influence can even be found in the Central Indian Bhil Languages as well as the Konkani dialect of Marathi.Grierson, G. (1925). On the Tirahi language. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (New Series), 57(03), 405-416. Tirahi is also spoken in a couple of villages southeast of the Afghan city of Jalalabad, such as Jaba, Mitarani, and Bara-khel. == Classification and Related Languages == Tirahi is a Dardic language, along with Kalasha, Gawar-Bati, and Pashayi languages. Further, Tirahi is part of the sub-group of Kohistani languages along with languages such as Bateri, Chilisso, Gowro, and others. However, Tirahi also shares with languages spoken farther to the east, such as Kashmiri. As a Dardic Language, Tirahi strongly preserves some vocabulary of spoken Sanskrit (cow - dƒìn in Tirahi, dhƒìnuh in Sanskrit, hand - ast in Tirahi, hastah in Sanskrit). Being a language spoken in Afghanistan, Tirahi shares various words and grammatical constructs with Pashto, a language spoken throughout Afghanistan to which many Tirahi speakers have become accustomed to speaking. Since Tirahi is entirely separated from the other Dardic languages, located south of the Kabul River and west of the Khyber Pass, rendering it wholly encased by Pashto. Tirahi also shares some vocabulary with Kashmiri and Shina such as the Tirahi mala, for a father, the Kashmiri mol, and the Shina malo. == Grammar == Tirahi shows much influence from Pashto in phonology, lexicon and even morphology. However, its vocabulary exhibits a connection to Kohistani dialects. Therefore, Tirahi seems to occupy an intermediate position between Pashto and the Kohistani group. Morgenstirne claims that Tirahi is \\"probably the remnant of a dialect group extending from Tirahi through the Peshawar district into Swat and Dir.\\" === Nouns and Adjectives === Tirahi is an inflected language, having 5 cases: Nominative, Oblique, Genitive, Dative, and Ablative. Adjectives, verbs, and nouns usually agree according to gender. Consonant-final nouns add e or a along with their traditional endings. There appears to be an indefinite article, added to the end of the word as an -ƒ´, similar to Farsi. {  ! !Singular !Plural ! !Singular !Plural - Nominative mala - 'father' mala  adam - 'man' adam-a - Oblique mala mal-an  adam-a adam-an - Dative mala-s mala  adam-a-s adam-an - Ablative mala-si mala-si  adam-a-si adam-an - Genitive mala-ma mala-si  adam-a-ma adam-an-si }  Pronouns  1st person pronouns: {  ! !Singular !Plural - Nominative au, ao mƒÅ, ao - Oblique mƒì mƒìn - Dative ma-si ma-si - Genitive myƒÅna (m), myƒÅni (s), myƒÅna (p?)

Gideon was a Senior Supervisory Special Agent and the unit chief of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit, and appeared from the series' pilot episode \\"Extreme Aggressor,\\" which was originally broadcast on September 22, 2005, until \\"In Name and Blood,\\" the second episode of the third season. He is also portrayed as a younger man by Ben Savage in flashbacks. Mandy Patinkin abruptly left the show in 2007, just as his character abruptly quit from the BAU, due to emotional distress. In 2012, Patinkin opened up about why he left stating that the show \\"was very destructive to my soul and my personality. After that, I didn't think I would get to work in television again.\\" Immediately after Gideon's departure, Hotchner was appointed unit chief. When Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) also departs the show, the position is given to Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), then temporarily to Jennifer Jareau (A.J. Cook), until Prentiss again becomes chief and remains so for the duration of the series. In season ten, Gideon is murdered off-screen by serial killer Donnie Mallick (Arye Gross). ==Background== Gideon was the prot√©g√© of Max Ryan (Geoff Pierson), who taught him everything he knew about profiling. One of Gideon's earliest cases was a bomber case, which was supervised by Max. As a prank for the new member, Max and the other investigators involved planted a list of the FBI director's whereabouts over the next 48 hours in the bomber's car for Gideon to find. When he found it, before Max could stop him, Gideon rushed up 25 flights of stairs and interrupted a meeting between the director and the U.S. Attorney General in an attempt to save him. During his early career with the FBI, Gideon was partnered with David Rossi (Joe Mantegna); following Gideon's resignation from the BAU, Rossi replaces him as Unit Chief. While investigating the case of Adrian Bale (Tim Kelleher), a.k.a. \\"The Boston Shrapnel Bomber,\\" Gideon had reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown after he sent six men into a warehouse before Bale detonated a bomb inside. All six agents and a hostage were killed, and he was blamed. He took a six-month medical leave because he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Upon his return from medical leave, he is given the Senior Agent position, as Hotchner is confirmed as Unit Chief. Not much is known about his personal life, other than that he is divorced and has a son named Stephen, from whom he is estranged. == Characterization == Through the first two seasons, Gideon is portrayed to be very good at chess, winning against Agent Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) many times, the only exception being Reid's birthday. Prior to the series, he was said to have had a \\"nervous breakdown\\" (or \\"major depressive episode\\") after he sent six agents into a warehouse with a bomb in it; all six agents and a hostage were killed, and he was heavily criticized about the event. He showed particular dislike for the practice of using religion as a defense or motivation for one's crimes. He blamed himself for the torture Reid received from Tobias Hankel (James Van Der Beek) as he had ordered Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) to add a virus warning to the videos Hankel posted. He also blamed himself for Agent Elle Greenaway's shooting. The character of Jason Gideon was partially based on real-life criminal profiler John E. Douglas, one of the founders of modern behavioral science. ==Relationships== He helps Reid and Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) through their personal struggles. He is shown to have a very close relationship with Reid, having hand-picked him from the FBI Academy for his team, helping Reid through many difficulties and even leaving the good-bye letter for Reid to find. ==Storylines== In the show's first episode, \\"Extreme Aggressor,\\" Gideon was called back to work to help profile a killer, called \\"The Seattle Strangler\\" by the media, who abducts women and holds them prisoner before strangling them and dumping their bodies. After solving the case of the Seattle Strangler, Gideon is seen at an old-fashioned gas station in Dumfries, Virginia. While inside, Gideon notices that the cashier (Lukas Haas) fits his profile of the Footpath Killer, a serial killer he had been investigating prior to being called in for the Seattle Strangler case. The man notices Gideon's gun and threatens him with a shotgun, insisting that he tell him who he is. When Gideon reveals he is with the FBI, the gunman becomes even more agitated. Gideon then tells the man that he can tell him the one thing no one has ever been able to tell him: why he stutters. However, Gideon does not truly know the answer but is merely trying to provoke a stutter in order to distract the killer. The killer forces Gideon down a hall and into a small room full of pictures of his victims. Gideon intentionally demeans and insults the killer, increasingly agitating him and making his stutter worse. He takes his eyes off Gideon just long enough for him to grab the gun and subdue the killer. In \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" a copycat bomber uses the methods of serial bomber Adrian Bale, the same criminal who committed the warehouse bombing that killed his six colleagues. Gideon has to face his past and Bale, to find out who the bomber is and stop him. After preventing the copycat's suicide bombing, Gideon is forced to make a deal with Bale to help diffuse a bomb set to kill the BAU team and a hostage. When Gideon realizes that Bale is lying about how dismantle it, he calls his bluff, saving them all from a bomb going off. He then has the pleasure of returning Bale to prison, the burden of the six agents' deaths presumably gone, even mocking him while he was being placed in a cell by using Bale's own words (\\"[A]n emotional release\\") in a sentence; he states that he finds an emotional release in putting away criminals like Bale. In \\"No Way Out,\\" Gideon faces serial killer Frank Breitkopf (Keith Carradine). The BAU had received a call from Georgia Davis (Melissa Leo), the Sheriff of the Golconda, Nevada Sheriff's Department, who had recently found two murder victims, both missing their right rib bones, similar to a case that took place in 1996. However, Gideon realized that this killer has been active for 30 years. After studying one of the murder victims, he determines that the killer has extensive medical knowledge; his victims are alive when he cut off their limbs; and he uses Ketamine to immobilize his victims. With this information, Gideon and the team are able to build a profile of the killer. In order to find the unsub, the Sheriff's Department set up a road-block looking for an RV, truck, or trailer, which was believed to be the killer's mode of transportation. Gideon later noticed that something is bothering Davis, and she tells him that the profile the BAU gave them reminds her of the experience of a mentally ill local named Jane Hanratty (Amy Madigan), a.k.a. Crazy Jane. The killer had abducted Jane 30 years before on the side of a road when her car broke down, but let her live; she believed that an alien had abducted her. Gideon deduces that the killer allowed Jane to survive because she wasn't scared of him. Eventually, Gideon leads local police in cornering Breitkopf in Fat Sam's Diner, and he tells them that he has abducted a group of schoolchildren in the middle of a desert, and is willing to let them go if Gideon brings Jane to him. Gideon makes a deal with Breitkopf: he and Jane will come with him if he takes them to where the children are. After the police rescue the children, Breitkopf and Jane walk off while Gideon runs in the opposite way. Gideon and Hotchner try to follow Breitkopf's tracks, but they suddenly disappear in the desert. In \\"No Way Out II: The Evilution of Frank,\\" while Gideon is trying to make up his mind about what flowers to buy his new girlfriend, Sarah Jacobs (Moira Squier), he sees Jane. When he looks up again, she has disappeared. Gideon then receives a call from Breitkopf, who is in Gideon's apartment, having murdered Sarah. He demands to have Jane back before hanging up. When the BAU begin to investigate, Gideon contacts Hotchner from a pay phone and tells him that Breitkopf dumped something in the trash on the street, later revealed to be bloody clothing. During the investigation, it is deduced that Breitkopf is targeting people Gideon previously rescued. Breitkopf later kills one such person, Rebecca Bryant (Amanda Bernero), who was abducted by serial killer Randall Garner (Charles Haid) and held captive for two years before being rescued by the BAU. Later, Tracy Belle (Elle Fanning), the only living victim of preteen spree killer Jeffrey Charles (Cameron Monaghan), goes missing. Gideon and Garcia are later able to figure out that the only story that moved Breitkopf the first time Gideon met him was that of the body of a woman who was found in an apartment on the Upper East Side of New York City because he was talking about his mother. Gideon then realizes that Breitkopf was hiding his mother's existence. Later, the team manages to find Breitkopf, who is calmly sitting on a bench at the Union Train Station, waiting for them to bring him Jane. The team brings in Jane, who refuses to go with Breitkopf. Gideon shows up and tells Breitkopf about Sarah, Breitkopf's mother, who Gideon claims was a prostitute. As Gideon and Hotchner describe Breitkopf, Jareau and Reid locate Tracy, who is bound and gagged but alive and unharmed. Breitkopf convinces Jane to come back to him, and the two commit suicide. Later, Tracy calls Gideon and thanks him for saving her once again. ===Departure and Death=== Gideon began to lose confidence in his profiling skills after Sarah's murder. During his final case in Arizona (\\"Doubt,\\" season 3), he further loses faith in his abilities when his decision to release a suspect resulted in the deaths of both the suspect and a young woman. As a result of Gideon's actions, Hotchner is suspended, which is the final straw for Gideon. At the end of the following episode, \\"In Name and Blood,\\" Reid visits Gideon's cabin but finds only his gun and badge, along with a letter meant for him. Gideon is last seen entering a Nevada diner; asked by a waitress where he is going, he replies that he does not know his destination or how he would know when he had reached it. He then leaves the diner and drives off, as his voiceover off-screen narrates the final lines of his letter: \\"I guess I'm just looking for it again. For the belief I had back in college. The belief I had when I first met Sarah and it all seemed so right. The belief in happy endings.\\" In the Season 10 episode \\"Nelson's Sparrow,\\" Gideon is murdered off-screen, having been shot dead at a close range by a serial killer named Donnie Mallick. During the flashbacks focusing on a young version of him for the episode, which show him working at the BAU in 1978, he is played by Ben Savage. ==References== Category:Criminal Minds characters Category:Fictional Behavioral Analysis Unit agents Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional characters with post- traumatic stress disorder Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Jason Gideon"},{"id":"35845458","text":"Gowro, also known as Gabaro, is a Dardic language of the Kohistani group spoken in Kohistan District, Pakistan. ==References== Category:Dardic languages ","title":"Gowro language"},{"id":"35845463","text":"The Covenant with Black America is a 2006 political, non-fiction book edited by the American talk-show host and writer Tavis Smiley.\\"The volume that's making a loud noise.\\" The Washington Post. 7 April 2006.\\"Black Commenter, Criticizing Obama, Causes Firestorm.\\" The Washington Post. February 16, 2008. Its theme is power relations between Black and White Americans. In 2006, the anthology was listed as The New York Times' number one bestseller. Smiley has stated that this was one of his goals for the book and by placing on the list it would make people discuss the book and its contents, as it would \\"force everyone to talk about it\\". The book consists of a collection of ten essays written by scholars and activists who are fighting to balance the scale between White and Black America. They offer a call to action for Black Americans, filled with \\"practical advice\\", to close the gap between them and White America. The overall message of the anthology recalls the 1970s campaigns of Jesse Jackson‚Äù The anthology's ultimate goal was to help Black America gain social, economic, and political power because without that power, the disparities between Black and White America will continue to grow. == Contents == The Covenants ten essays, all focused on different areas of social and political disparities, offer theories to help alleviate these disparities. Listed as \\"Covenants\\", the ten essays are as follows: ‚ÄúSecuring the Right to Health Care and Wellbeing,‚Äù ‚ÄúEstablishing a System of Public Education in Which All Children Achieve at High Levels and Reach Their Full Potential,‚Äù ‚ÄúCorrecting the System of Unequal Justice,‚Äù ‚ÄúFostering Accountable Community- Centered Policing,‚Äù ‚ÄúEnsuring Broad Access to Affordable Neighborhoods That Connect to Opportunity,‚Äù ‚ÄúClaiming Our Democracy,‚Äù ‚ÄúStrengthening Our Rural Roots,‚Äù ‚ÄúAccessing Good Jobs, Wealth, and Economic Prosperity,‚Äù ‚ÄúAssuring Environmental Justice for All,‚Äù and ‚ÄúClosing the Racial Digital Divide.‚Äù Cornel West concludes the book with a final call to action. == The Ten Covenants  I: \\"Securing the Right to Health Care and Wellbeing\\"=== By David M.

The apical two thirds of the forewing have an inconspicuous area of white scales near the midlength of the costa and a similar, smaller area slightly more distad. There is a broad transverse band, parallel to distal margin of the yellow area and a small group of scales behind the basal white area. There is a short curved band extending from the distal white area and a submarginal longer straight, iridescent blue violet band parallel to the outer wing margin. The hindwings are dark brown with a white patch on the basal half of the anterior margin.Neotropical Microlepidoptera XX: Revision of the Genus Setiostoma (Lepidoptera: Stenomidae) The larvae feed on Quercus species, including Quercus nigra and Quercus stellata.

The voiceless aspirate series is secure, and, unlike the neighboring Palula language, Kalkoti does not have a breathy voiced series. The phonemic status of / î/ is unclear and is likely tied to tone in Kalkoti. ===Tone=== Kalkoti's system of tone likely was similar to Shina's two tone system; however, under pressure from its Kohistani neighbors it may now have a more complex tone inventory. ==References Bibliography == * Category:Dardic languages ","title":"Kalkoti language"},{"id":"35845490","text":"Guilherme Andrade da Silva, commonly known as Guilherme Andrade, (born 31 January 1989 in Montes Claros) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a right back for Barretos. ==Honours== ;Corinthians *FIFA Club World Cup: 2012 *Campeonato Paulista: 2013 *Recopa Sudamericana: 2013 == Statistics == { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" style=\\"margin:auto; background:ivory; font-size:95%; border:1px #aaa solid; border- collapse:collapse; clear:center;\\" + Club performance - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"Brasileir√£o S√©rie A !colspan=\\"2\\"Brasileir√£o S√©rie B !colspan=\\"2\\"Copa do Brasil !colspan=\\"2\\"Libertadores !colspan=\\"2\\"Copa Sudamericana !colspan=\\"2\\"Campeonato Paulista !colspan=\\"2\\"Friendly !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals -  style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Ponte Preta 2009 002300000007200300 -  2010 0026140000017200474 -  2011 0030310000013100444 -  2012 000050000018300233 - ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\"Total ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 79 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 4 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 10 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 55 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 8 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 144 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 11 -  style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"Corinthians 2012 8000000000000080 -  2013 0000000000400040 -  2014 6000200000001090 - ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\"Total ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 14 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 2 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 4 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 1 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 21 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 - ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\"Total ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 14 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 79 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 4 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 12 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 59 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 8 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 1 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 0 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 165 ! style=\\"text-align:left; background:beige;\\" 11 } FIFA Club World Cup {  - !

She was seized by the British on 3 July 1940 and transferred to the Free French Naval Forces, seeing service in the Battle of Dakar (\\"Operation Menace\\") in September 1940. The ship was rearmed by the British in 1941. Her main armament was replaced by twin QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval guns, and she also received a single QF 2-pounder pom-pom AA gun to replace the quadruple 13.2 mm/76 AA guns. She retained her original twin 13.2 mm/76 AA guns, but had an additional four twin and two single 12.7 mm/62 machine guns installed. Post- war she remained in service with the French Navy. In 1947 she was rearmed again, with a single German 105 mm/45 calibre SK C/32 gun as main armament, a single Bofors 40 mm/60 Mk.3 and four single 20 mm/70 Mk.2 Oerlikons.

The spatial resolution of GOCI is about 500m and the range of target area is about 2,500 km√ó2,500 km centered on Korean Peninsula. GOCI was loaded on Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) of South Korea which was launched in June, 2010. It will be operated by Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) at Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST), and capture the images of ocean-color around the Korean Peninsula 8 times a day for 7.7 years. The ocean data products that can be derived from the measurements are mainly the chlorophyll concentration, the optical diffuse attenuation coefficients, the concentration of dissolved organic material or yellow substance, and the concentration of suspended particles in the near-surface zone of the sea. In operational oceanography, satellite derived data products are used in conjunction with numerical models and in situ measurements to provide forecasting and now casting of the ocean state. Such information is of genuine interest for many categories of users. ==Vision and goals== *Detecting, monitoring and predicting short term biophysical phenomena *Studies on biogeochemical variables and cycle *Detecting, monitoring and predicting noxious or toxic algal blooms of notable extension *Monitoring the health of marine ecosystem *Coastal zone and resource management *Producing an improved marine fisheries information to the fisherman communities *Deriving Yellow dust and the land classified information ==GOCI specification== { style=\\"background:white;color:black\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center !Description!!Specification - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Detector CMOS (2D, 1415√ó1432 pixels) - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Radiometric Calibration Solar diffuser & DAMD(Diffuser Aging Monitoring Device) - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Resolution (GSD) 500m - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Total FOV 16 slots, 5,300√ó5,300 Pixels - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Coverage 2,500 km√ó2,500 km - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Longitude 128.2¬∞E - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Altitude 35,786 km - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !SNR > 1,000 - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !MTF > 0.3 - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !# of Bands 8Í∞ú (6-Visible, 2-NIR) - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !Spectral Coverage 400~900 nm } ==GOCI bands== { style=\\"background:white;color:black\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center !Band(#)!!Central Wavelengths(nm)!!Bandwidth(nm)!!SNR!!Type!!Primary Application - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !1 412 20 1,000 Visible Yellow substance and turbidity - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !2 443 20 1,090 Visible Chlorophyll absorption maximum - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !3 490 20 1,170 Visible Chlorophyll and other pigments - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !4 555 20 1,070 Visible Turbidity, suspended sediment - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !5 660 20 1,010 Visible Atmospheric correction for turbid water, Baseline of fluorescence signal, Chlorophyll, suspended sediment - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !6 680 10 870 Visible fluorescence signal - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !7 745 20 860 NIR Atmospheric correction and baseline of fluorescence signal - style=\\"background:white; color:black\\" !8 865 40 750 NIR Atmospheric correction, vegetation, water vapor reference over the ocean } ==See also== *Ocean color *Remote sensing *Geostationary orbit ==References== #https://web.archive.org/web/20130325103032/http://kosc.kordi.re.kr/oceansatellite/coms- goci/introduction.kosc #Seongick Cho, Yu-Hwan Ahn, Joo-Hyung Ryu, Gm-Sil Kang, and Heong-Sik Youn, ‚ÄúDevelopment of Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI),‚Äù Korean Journal of Remote Sensing, vol.26, no.2, 2010, pp. 157‚Äì165. ==External links== *Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) * Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST) Category:Artificial satellites in geosynchronous orbit Category:Satellite imaging sensors ","title":"Geostationary Ocean Color Imager"},{"id":"35845613","text":"John Kevin Delaney (born April 16, 1963) is an American attorney, businessman, politician, and former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who was the United States Representative for Maryland's 6th congressional district from 2013 to 2019. On July 28, 2017, Delaney became the first Democrat to announce his run for president in 2020. Delaney did not run for re-election to Congress in 2018, choosing to focus on his presidential campaign. In November 2018, fellow Democrat David Trone was elected to succeed Delaney in Congress, and subsequently endorsed him for President in 2020. Delaney suspended his campaign on January 31, 2020. ==Early life and education== Delaney grew up in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, the son of Elaine (Rowe), and Jack Delaney, an electrician. He is the nephew of former Aetna CEO John Rowe. He is of three quarters Irish and one quarter English descent. Delaney spent part of his youth working at his father's construction sites. Delaney graduated from Bergen Catholic High School.\\"Dem Presidential Candidate Delnaey: American People Are 'Dying' for Someone to 'Bring Us Together'\\", Grabien.com from MSNBC, November 17, 2017. Accessed January 22, 2018. \\"DELANEY: 'Good to be here.' GEIST: 'I will forgive you for having gone to Bergen Catholic High School, which is my rival high school.' Scholarships from his father's labor union (IBEW Local 164) as well as the American Legion, VFW, and the Lions Club helped Delaney attend college; he earned a B.A. degree from Columbia University in 1985, and a J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1988. ==Business career== Delaney co-founded two companies that were publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. He won the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2004. In 1993, Delaney co-founded Health Care Financial Partners (HCFP), to make loans available to smaller-sized health care service providers said to be ignored by larger banks. HCFP went public in 1996, and its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1998. Health Care Financial Partners was acquired by Heller Financial in 1999. In 2000, Delaney co-founded CapitalSource, a commercial lender headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland; the company provided capital to roughly 5,000 small and mid-size businesses before his departure. In 2010, while Delaney was CEO, CapitalSource was awarded a Bank Enterprise Award from the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund by the U.S. Treasury Department for its investment in low- income and economically distressed communities. In 2005, CapitalSource was named one of Washingtonian magazine's best places to work for its company culture and employee benefits. CapitalSource continued to be publicly traded on the NYSE after Delaney's election, making him the only former CEO of a publicly traded company to serve in the 113th United States Congress. In 2014, the lender merged with PacWest Bancorp. ==U.S. House of Representatives2012 election=== After redistricting following the 2010 census, Delaney decided to run for the newly redrawn 6th district against 10-term Republican incumbent Roscoe Bartlett. The district had long been a Republican stronghold, but it had been significantly reconfigured. The Maryland General Assembly shifted heavily Republican Carroll County and a mostly Republican section of Frederick County into the heavily Democratic 8th district. It shifted Republican-tilting sections of Harford and Baltimore counties into the already heavily Republican 1st district. Taking their place was a heavily Democratic spur of western Montgomery County, which ended just two blocks from Delaney's home in Potomac. The redrawn district, the state's second-largest, included nearly the entire western portion of the state, but the bulk of its vote came from the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C. On paper, this dramatically altered the district's demographics, turning it from a heavily Republican district into a Democratic-leaning district. While John McCain carried the 6th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, Barack Obama would have carried the new 6th with 56 percent. The Montgomery County share of the district has three times as many people as the rest of the district combined. The shifts were quite controversial, as Republicans accused Democrats of shifting district boundaries in their favor, and former Governor Martin O'Malley later admitted the redrawn districts would favor Democrats. \\"That was my hope,\\" O'Malley told attorneys in a deposition. \\"It was also my intent to create ... a district where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican.\\" During the primary, Delaney was endorsed by former President Bill Clinton, U.S. Congresswoman Donna Edwards, Comptroller Peter Franchot, The Washington Post, and the Gazette. On April 3, 2012, Delaney won the five-candidate Democratic primary field with 54% of the vote. The next closest opponent, State Senator Robert J. Garagiola, received 29% of the vote, 25 points behind Delaney. In the November 6, 2012 general election, Delaney defeated Bartlett by 59%‚Äì38%, a 21-point margin. He won the Montgomery County share of the district by almost 56,000 votes, accounting for almost all of the overall 58,900 margin of votes. ===2014 election=== Delaney faced a closer-than- expected contest for reelection against Dan Bongino, the Republican candidate in 2012 for U.S. Senator from Maryland. He ultimately won by just over 2,200 votes, mainly due to carrying the Montgomery County portion of the district by over 20,500 votes. ===2016 election=== Delaney won a third term in 2016, taking 56 percent of the vote to Republican Amie Hoeber's 40 percent. ===Tenure=== Delaney introduced legislation to end partisan gerrymandering. The Open Our Democracy Act of 2017 would appoint independent redistricting commissions nationwide to end partisan gerrymandering, make Election Day a federal holiday, and create an open top-two primary system. Delaney was ranked as the 53rd most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party). In 2015, a similar ranking by the nonpartisan site GovTrack ranked Delaney third highest for bipartisanship among all House Democrats. ===Committee assignments=== * Committee on Financial Services ** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * Joint Economic Committee ===Caucus memberships=== * New Democrat Coalition * Congressional Arts Caucus * Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus * Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus * Climate Solutions Caucus ==2020 presidential bid== Logo for Delaney's presidential campaign Despite a rumored bid to run against governor Larry Hogan in 2018, Delaney bypassed the 2018 elections altogether. On July 28, 2017, he announced his run for president in 2020 in a Washington Post op-ed. Delaney favors universal health coverage and has proposed a public plan that would cover all Americans under the age of 65 (while leaving Medicare for those over 65 untouched). He opposes Medicare-for-all, arguing that advocacy for the policy would help Trump get re-elected. During a June 2019 debate, Delaney claimed that hospitals will be shuttered under Medicare-for-all; Politifact, the Washington Post fact-checker, and Kaiser Health News all found this claim to be false and unsubstantiated. Delaney dropped out of the presidential race on January 31, 2020. He cited his failure to gain traction in polls and wanting to avoid pulling support from other moderate candidates as reasons behind the suspension of his campaign. ==Political positions== Delaney has been frequently referred to as a \\"moderate\\". However, he does not entirely identify as such. Delaney has remarked, However, statements made then since then suggest he has since embraced the moderate label. Appearing on PBS NewsHour on May 8, 2019, Delaney remarked, \\"I am probably the most moderate candidate\\" in the field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. He has received the top score of 100 from the Human Rights Campaign for his support of equality- related legislation, with him stating \\"No one should be discriminated against because of who they are or who they love\\" in response to this recognition. Delaney has said he would support increasing the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 23 percent \\"to raise about $200 billion for infrastructure\\". ==Personal life== Delaney and his wife April (n√©e McClain) met at Georgetown University Law Center; they have four daughters; Summer, Brooke, Lily, and Grace. April is the Washington, D.C. Director for Common Sense Media, a non- profit organization dedicated to educating families on social media while also conducting reviews and ratings for movies, TV series, and documentaries. Two of Delaney's four daughters attend Northwestern University while his oldest daughter, Summer, worked as a video journalist and multimedia reporter for Tribune Media and WPIX (PIX11) News. Delaney is Catholic, and has said that \\"to some extent\\" his faith has guided his \\"social justice orientation\\". He was also a member of the Board of Directors of several organizations: St. Patrick's Episcopal Day School (Chairman), Georgetown University, National Symphony Orchestra, and the International Center for Research on Women. ==References * Official website * * Category:1963 births Category:Candidates in the 2020 United States presidential election Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Bergen Catholic High School alumni Category:Businesspeople from Maryland Category:Businesspeople from New Jersey Category:Catholics from Maryland Category:Catholics from New Jersey Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Georgetown University Law Center alumni Category:Living people Category:Maryland Democrats Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Maryland Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:People from Potomac, Maryland Category:People from Wood- Ridge, New Jersey ","title":"John Delaney (Maryland politician)"},{"id":"35845616","text":"Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carbonitrile is a chemical which is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. ==References== Category:Nitriles Category:Pesticides Category:Bicyclic compounds ","title":"Bicyclo(2.2.1)heptane-2-carbonitrile"},{"id":"35845617","text":"Merrell (standing farthest right on pier) salutes President Theodore Roosevelt (at left, back to camera, tipping his top hat) as Roosevelt steps off the barge from the presidential yacht onto the pier at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, on 22 July 1908 to spend the day as chairman of the ongoing Battleship Conference there.

The unit was run by Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, who has since stepped down. A series of derivative transactions involving credit default swaps (CDS) were entered, reportedly as part of the bank's \\"hedging\\" strategy. Trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale, accumulated outsized CDS positions in the market. An estimated trading loss of US$2 billion was announced. The loss amounted to more than $6 billion for JP Morgan Chase. These events gave rise to a number of investigations to examine the firm's risk management systems and internal controls. JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $920 million in fines. JPMorgan Chase cut chief executive Jamie Dimon's 2012 pay in half, to $11.5 million from $23 million, due to the $6 billion trading loss. ==Background== In February 2012, hedge fund insiders such as Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital Management became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by aggressive trading activities. The source of the unusual activity turned out to be Bruno Iksil, a trader for JPMorgan Chase & Co. Market-moving trades by the bank's Chief Investment Office had first been uncovered in June 2011 by trade journal Creditflux, which reported on anomalies in CDX HY index tranche pricing dynamics caused by Iksil's trading activity. The same journal reported on further tranche trading activity by the JP Morgan unit two months later. By 2012, heavy opposing bets to his positions had been made by traders, including another branch of JPMorgan, who purchased the derivatives that JPMorgan was selling in high volume. JPMorgan denied the first news reports, with Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon calling it a \\"tempest in a teapot.\\" Major losses of $2 billion were reported by the firm in May 2012 in relation to these trades. On July 13, 2012, the total loss was updated to $5.8 billion with the addition of a $4.4 billion loss in the second quarter and subsequent recalculation of a loss of $1.4 billion for the first quarter. A spokesman for the firm claimed that projected total losses could be more than $7 billion. The disclosure, which resulted in headlines in the media, did not disclose the exact nature of the trading involved, which remained in progress as of May 16, 2012, as JPMorgan's losses mounted and other traders sought to profit or avoid losses resulting from JPMorgan's positions. As of June 28, 2012, JPMorgan's positions were continuing to produce losses which could total as much as $9 billion under worst-case scenarios. The trades were possibly related to CDX IG 9, a credit default swap index based on the default risk of major U.S. corporations that has been described as a \\"derivative of a derivative\\". On the company's emergency conference call, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said the strategy was \\"flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored\\".\\"Two Billion Dollar Hedge\\" Financial Times. The episode is being investigated by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the FBI. \\"More Bad News as FBI gets involved\\" Forbes. ==Trades== On February 2, 2012, at the Harbor Investment Conference, speaking to an audience of investors, Boaz Weinstein recommended buying the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Series 9 10-Year Index, CDX IG 9. This is a derivative that measures the spread (difference in interest rates) between the interest rates of investment-grade worthy companies and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This was a derivative which Weinstein had noticed to be losing value in a manner and to a degree which seemed to diverge from market expectations. It turned out that JPMorgan was shorting the index by making huge trades. JPMorgan's bet was that credit markets would strengthen; the index is based on 121 investment grade bonds issued by North American corporations. Investors who followed Weinstein's tip did poorly during the early months of 2012 as JPMorgan strongly supported its position. However, by May, after investors became concerned about the implications of the European financial crisis, the situation reversed and JPMorgan suffered large losses. In addition to Weinstein's Saba Capital Management, Blue Mountain Capital, BlueCrest Capital, Lucidus Capital Partners, CQS, III, and Hutchin Hill are hedge funds which are known to have benefited from taking the other side of the trade to JPMorgan. A separate unit of JPMorgan was also on the winning side.[5] The $6.2 billion loss came from three positions that partially offset one another. It occurred when the world's financial markets were in relative calm. Had quality spread curves twisted or worldwide economic distress been more pronounced the loss could have been much higher.http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/JPMWhalePSI.pdf The Financial Times \\"Alphaville\\" analysis suggests that these positions were not volatile enough to account for the full losses reported.FT Alphaville High- Yield Tranche They suggest that other positions are likely involved as well.FT Alphavile Tracking Trades Down ==Investigation== The internal investigation concluded in July 2012. It involved more than 1,000 people across the firm and outside law firm WilmerHale. A report issued in January 2013 made the following \\"key observations\\"\\"Report of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Management Task Force Regarding 2012 CIO Losses\\", January 16, 2013 . Accessed 25 June 2014 *\\"CIO [Chief Investment Office] judgment, execution and escalation in the First Quarter of 2012 were poor\\" *\\"The Firm did not ensure that the controls and oversight of CIO evolved commensurately with the increased complexity and risks of certain CIO activities\\" *\\"CIO risk management was ineffective in dealing with synthetic credit portfolio\\" *\\"Risk limits for CIO were not sufficiently granular\\" *\\"Approval and implementation of CIO Synthetic Credit VaR Model were inadequate\\" In July 2017, U.S. prosecutors dropped criminal charges against two derivative traders from France and Spain after unsuccessful efforts to extradite them from their countries. ==JPM organizational structure, risk systems, accounting and internal control== The trades occurred within the Chief Investment Office (CIO), where staff were reportedly \\"faithfully executing strategies demanded by the bank's risk management model\\". This unit is reported to have very wide latitude in otherwise unsupervised trading. The company had been without a treasurer for five months during the time of the trades and had a relatively inexperienced executive, Irvin Goldman, in charge of risk management in the CIO. The trades took place in a unit of JPMorgan that reported directly to Chairman & CEO Jamie Dimon. In Congressional testimony it came out that Dimon wanted to be responsible for what information was revealed, and information was withheld from the regulators. There had been a series of violations of the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley regulations requiring certain protections.. Interview with Janet Tavakoli. On May 10, 2012, Dimon announced that there was a loss of at least $2 billion through \\"egregious mistakes\\" in trading. ==Impact on Volcker Rule implementation== The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, bans high-risk trading inside commercial banking and lending institutions. The Volcker rule is sometimes referred to as \\"a modern Glass-Steagall firewall that separates core banking system from higher-risk, hedge fund-style proprietary trading\\". The rule's implementation had been repeatedly delayed however, with analysts predicting implementation in 2014 and lobbyists simultaneously pushing to delay it longer.

He sponsored and took part in expeditions across the world to collect biological specimens and cultural artifacts on behalf of the American Museum of Natural History. The Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall of South Asian mammals in the AMNH is named after him. == Early life == left Born in Weymouth, England, Vernay was born to Louisa Stannard and Thomas Crabb Avant. Shortly after his parents divorced, he emigrated to New York in August 1904 and changed his surname from Avant to Vernay. He found a job as an elevator operator at a furniture store known as A.J. Crawfords and after working there briefly, Vernay started his own shop in 1906, called Arthur S. Vernay, Inc. located at 1 East 45th Street, near Madison Avenue. He also had a shop in London at 217 Piccadilly in the late 1910s to 1920s. He sold antiques and decorative artworks to a number of important and influential New Yorkers including Ogden Codman Jr., Elsie de Wolfe, Sir Charles Carrick Allom, Consuelo Vanderbilt, Francis Patrick Garvan, Benjamin Altman, Solomon R. Guggenheim, William Russell Grace, as well as leading art dealerships such as M Knoedler & Co, and the design firm Tiffany Studios. == Travel and hunting == alt= In the 1920s, Vernay grew increasingly interested in game hunting and naturalist exploration. In 1921 he stayed at the Biligirirangans with Ralph Camroux Morris and saw wild animals in nature for the first time. He returned to the US and then sponsored a collecting expedition led by Colonel John Champion Faunthorpe intended to enhance the American Museum of Natural History's collection of Southeast Asian animals, Vernay joined Faunthorpe in India in 1923. This expedition culminated in the American Museum of Natural History's Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall of South Asiatic Mammals, which opened in 1930 and held mounted elephants shot by the collectors in Mysore. He was elected Vice Patron of the Bombay Natural History Society in 1928. In 1935 he became a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and in the same year he accompanied Charles Suydam Cutting to Tibet where they met the Dalai Lama. His last expedition was to Africa in 1946. Around the same time he became very interested in orchids. == Bahamas == alt=Vernay sold off his company in the 1940s (it was then run by Stephen Jussel) and moved to Nassau, Bahamas, where he cultivated an orchid greenhouse, collected species from South America, participated in environmental conservation efforts, co-founding the Bahamas National Trust and the Society for the Preservation of the Flamingo. In the Bahamas, Vernay lived with his wife Marion Kelley (married 1908) at their home, Los Cayos, and was part of an expatriate social community that included the Duke of Windsor and Duchess of Windsor, the Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren, and hosted the English author Ian Fleming when he visited the Bahamas in 1956 before writing both Dr. No and Thunderball. Fleming accompanied Vernay and Robert Cushman Murphy along with his friend and OSS agent Ivar Felix Bryce, to Inagua which had the largest flamingo colony in the world. ==Expeditions== The major expeditions sponsored by Vernay include: * Faunthorpe-Vernay Expedition to India, 1923 * Vernay-Angola Expedition, 1925 * Vernay-Archbold Expedition to Madagascar, 1929 * Vernay Scientific Survey of the Eastern Ghats (with collectors V.S.

Born in Guarapuava, in the southern state of Paran√°, Brazil, Cruz has lived in the United States since 1984. He currently divides his time between his studios in New York City and S√£o Paulo. Much of his work in photography has focused on the people, architecture and landscape of Brazil. In 1996 Cruz was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Faces of the Rainforest, a project documenting the life of indigenous people in the Brazilian Rainforest. The Guggenheim Foundation further supported this project with a publication subvention award in 2000. His work is held in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) New York Public Library and Brooklyn Museum, among others. ==Career== Cruz became interested in photography in the late 1970s through George Stone‚Äôs work for National Geographic and began to study photography at the Germain School in 1983. He then received technical and aesthetic training from George Tice at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. He collaborated with Tice in the authorized production of two Steichen portfolios, Juxtapositions (1986) and Blue Skies (1987) after which time he devoted his energies exclusive to his own work. ==Exhibitions== Since 1982 his photographs have been the subject of more than fifty solo exhibitions at venues including the National Arts Club, New York City; the Houston Center for Photography, Houston, TX; FotoFest International, Houston, TX; the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art, S√£o Paulo, Brazil; Pinacoteca do Estado de S√£o Paulo, Brazil; the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and the Oscar Niemeyer Museum, Curitiba, Paran√°, Brazil. ==Collections== Cruz's work is held in the following public collections, among others: *Brooklyn Museum, New York: 4 prints (as of November 2019); *Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, OH *Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX *The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, NY *New York Public Library: 1 print (as of November 2019); *Acervo Art√≠stico Cultural dos Pal√°cios dos Governo do Estado de S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo, Brasil *Instituto Cultural Ita√∫, S√£o Paulo, Brasil *MAB FAAP Museu de Arte Brasileira (MAB), S√£o Paulo, Brasil *Museu de Arte de S√£o Paulo (MASP), S√£o Paulo, Brasil ==Reviews and commentary== > His composition is elegant and imaginative.

The wind power potential of Murmansk Oblast is one of the largest among regions of Russian. Wind power in Russia has a long history of small-scale use, but the country has not yet developed large-scale commercial wind energy production. Most of its current limited wind production is located in agricultural areas with low population densities, where connection to the main energy grid is difficult. In 2006, Russia had a total installed wind capacity of 15 MW. Russia is estimated to have a total potential of 80,000 TWh/yr for wind energy, 6,218 TWh/yr of which is economically feasible. Most of this potential is found in the southern steppes and the seacoasts of the country, although in many of these areas the population density is very low, at less than . This low population density means that there is little existing electricity infrastructure currently in place, which hinders development of these resources. Current Russian wind energy projects have a combined capacity of over 1,700 MW, although less than 17 MW had been installed as of the end of 2010. The Russian Wind Energy Association predicts that if Russia achieves its goal of having 4.5% of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020, the country will have a total wind capacity of 7,000 MW. In 2010, plans for the construction of a wind power plant in Yeisk, on the Sea of Azov, were announced. It is expected to initially have a capacity of 50 MW, which will become 100 MW a year later. German engineering company Siemens announced in July 2010, following a visit to Russia by Chancellor Angela Merkel, that it would build wind power plants in Russia.

The film is released island-wide in Singapore on 17 May 2012 and released in Malaysia in June 2012. ==Plot== Ping Xiao is a popular radio DJ who had been nominated for the \\"Most Popular Male DJ\\" award nine times, winning two of them, and is expected to win the tenth nomination. However, when Ping Xiao is caught in a scandal in which he harasses a female patron of a bar while drunk, thinking that she is his deceased horror novelist girlfriend, Jia Li, he is demoted by his boss to host the late-night show, the \\"Ghost on Air\\", to save face, while his post is temporarily replaced by a young female host, Pauline. Thinking that Pauline is plotting to deny him his award, he acts cold to her, though she is genuinely worried for his deteriorating condition. As the host of the late-night show, Ping Xiao's job is to tell ghost stories to his audience, most of which he samples from those gathered by Jia Li. Jia Li had left several video detailing her researches to Ping Xiao before her sudden death a month before. Throughout his experiences, Ping Xiao becomes haunted by the ghosts of the stories, which turn out to be real. One of the stories recounts the life of Jia Li's friend, Ya Ru, who disappeared for six months before suddenly returning, only to reveal that she is pregnant. She aborted the fetus, but felt that her unborn child is haunting her for aborting him. Ya Ru later committed suicide. Through Jia Li's mother, Ping Xiao visits Shophouse 14 boarding house, where a middle school student, Ai Xi, had committed suicide. After several nights, Ping Xiao discovers that the mean landlady, Mang Pao, has been hiding her son, Ya Nan, who had assaulted Ai Xi. He reports this to the authorities and recovers his status, ultimately winning the DJ award. The hauntings of the boarding house, though, has made him cold and distant. After returning from the award celebration, Ping Xiao views the last video recorded by Jia Li, in which she, having returned from doing research in Shophouse 14, became terrified of the hauntings that she experienced, culminating in her death. Ping Xiao turns back and screams when he sees all the ghosts of the stories menacing him, suggesting that he will share Jia Li's fate. ==Cast== *Dennis Chew as Ping Xiao, popular radio personality who has fallen grace after a much published scandal *Gan Mei Yan as Jia Li, Ping Xiao's late girlfriend *Samuel Chong as Albert, Ping Xiao's superior *Eunice Olsen as Pauline, rival radio DJ to Ping Xiao *Choo Siew Feng as Mang Po, owner of Shophouse 14 *Rei Poh as Ya Nan, son of Mang Po *Sheena Chan as Ya Ru, Jia Li's best friend *William Lawandi as Guo Ming, fellow DJ *Clarissa Kok as Nana, fellow DJ *Lee Shan Hui as Ai Xi, a 14-year-old deceased schoolgirl ==Production== The director Cheng and Zhou met in 2008 during the promotion of Kallang Roar the Movie.

It is an affiliate of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) or AFL-CIO. UAW Local 5810 was chartered in 2008. The stand-alone postdoctoral scholar contract negotiated between UC and UAW is notable for being the first of its kind in the United States. ==Membership== Local 5810 represents over 6,000 postdoctoral researchers at the University of California, or approximately one tenth of all postdoctoral researchers in the United States. UC postdocs work in all fields of the academy, but are overwhelmingly concentrated in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Postdocs perform highly technical work, often under exacting conditions. Prior to ratification of their first contract, the majority of postdocs at UC were paid less than $41,000 per year. ==Formation== In 2005, a group of postdoctoral researchers employed by the UC, many of whom were previously members of UAW Local 2865 and other local unions representing academic student employees, approached the UAW and asked for help forming a union. The group began an organizing drive as Postdoctoral Researchers Organize/UAW or PRO/UAW. On August 19, 2008, the California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) certified that a majority of UC postdocs had chosen PRO/UAW as their union. Contract negotiations began in February 2009. ==Contract negotiations== Negotiations of the first contract, which spanned a year and a half, were protracted and contentious. During that time, union supporters picketed at all ten University of California campuses. On April 30, 2010, the House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor held a field hearing at UC Berkeley to evaluate the unusually lengthy amount of time it was taking to reach agreement. During the hearing, Vice President of Human Resources for the University of California Dwaine Duckett testified that the delay was due to difficulty tracking complex funding formulas used to allocate postdoc salaries. A postdoctoral researcher also testified about her difficult experience as an expectant and new mother within the UC system. After the hearing, Committee Chairman George Miller wrote UC President Mark Yudof expressing \\"deep concern\\" about UC's slow-paced approach, saying he \\"left the hearing thoroughly disappointed\\" in UC's efforts to reach agreement. Congressman Miller was then joined by Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey in sending a letter to the Government Accountability Office asking the agency to look into \\"how universities, including the University of California, track how funds provided for laboratory research grants are spent.\\" ===First contract=== The contract was ratified on August 11, 2010 with 96 percent of the vote, and made significant advances in pay, health benefits and safety on the job for postdocs. Postdoc negotiators were successful in linking minimum salaries to an experience-based scale set by the NIH for NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowships. UC postdocs are guaranteed minimum salary increases with every year of experience. === Second contract === As of September 2015, the union was in negotiations for a second contract. ==References * UAW Local 5810 Category:Trade unions in California Category:University of California Category:Trade unions affiliated with the United Auto Workers Category:Postdoctoral research ","title":"UAW Local 5810"},{"id":"35845848","text":"Jacob's Ladder is a 2005 young adult novel by British author Brian Keaney. It follows the protagonist Jacob through his struggles to escape from another world without memories of his past. ==Plot summary== The story begins as the protagonist, Jacob awakes in a field with no memory of who he is. His only clue is his name, and the fact that his clothes are covered with brown stains. From here Jacob is led by a man called Virgil to a place called Locus. Locus initially resembles a school because of the number of children, but the children do not attend classes, and instead pick stones in the 'picking fields'. Here Jacob meets a girl named Aysha, and a boy called Toby, both of whom become his friends. After a series of visions, Jacob comes to the realisation that he has died, and Locus is the 'next world' to which he has been sent. Together Toby, Aysha and Jacob set out from Locus, taking a small amount of provisions with them. They walk for a day or so, eating some of their food before waking up to find that the rest had turned into ash. They came across a woman (Nemain) washing brown-stained clothes in a river they had drunk from. After lodging with the woman for a day, they fled when the woman complained about the stained clothes, saying: \\"How am I supposed to get all the blood off these clothes?\\". While they fled, they met a group of nomadic people, called the Dedanim. The Dedanim, who have strong biblical connotations (See: Dedan) invited Jacob and co. to stay with them. However, after a few nights, Jacob feels that he is losing sight of his goal, and leaves, followed by Aysha and Toby. At this moment they wake up to find that the Dedanim had disappeared and they were lying where they had been before. They travelled on and were split up after being chased by wild dogs. Jacob is cut off from the group, and meets an elderly man named Moloch (Another religious name, see: Moloch), who lives in a cave. Jacob slowly figures out that Moloch is a cannibal, but finds out too late, for he was promptly trapped in Moloch's cave. As Moloch starts a fire to smoke Jacob to death, Jacob finds a small passageway at the back of the cave. He proceeds to crawl his way towards the end of the tunnel, which ended in a very high ladder. The ladder (which the novel is presumably named after) is Brian Keaney's representation of the Biblical Jacob's Ladder. After Jacob struggles to the top of the ladder (momentarily contemplating giving up), and comes across a white palace in the desert. He is briefly united with Aysha and Toby before they individually meet the ruler of Locus. The 'ruler' is a being bearing the face of an old man and a beautiful woman. It loosely resembles Roman myth Janus in the way it guards a gate back to the 'normal' world. Its dual-personality (pessimistic and optimistic) also echo Janus's myth. ==Publishing information== Jacob's Ladder was published in the US by Candlewick Press Incorporated, Cambridge, MA and in the UK by Orchard Books of London. The novel has been translated into Polish and Welsh.Jacob's Ladder at WorldCat ==Awards received== Jacob's Ladder won the Havering 'Best of the Best Award' for teenage fiction, and was shortlisted for South Lanarkshire book award, Calderdale Children's Book Award and the Warwickshire children's book awards.Author's website ==References== Category:2005 British novels Category:British young adult novels Category:British fantasy novels Category:Young adult fantasy novels Category:Novels about the afterlife ","title":"Jacob's Ladder (novel)"},{"id":"35845868","text":"The Monument to the Restorers () is a monument located in Restauradores Square in Lisbon, Portugal. The monument memorializes the victory of the Portuguese Restoration War. The war, which saw the end of the House of Habsburg and the rise of the House of Braganza, lasted from 1640 to 1668. The monument was designed by Ant√≥nio Tom√°s da Fonseca and erected in 1886. ==History== The monument is unveiled, 1886. The was established in 1861 as reaction to groups defending Iberian federalism. The patriotic society was founded by Feliciano de Andrade Moura, a Lisbon merchant, and soon attracted notable figures of Portuguese society, such as Alexandre Herculano and Anselmo Braamcamp Freire. One of the main goals of the commission was to properly memorialise the anniversaries of the Portuguese Restoration of Independence from the Spanish in 1640. After successfully lobbying the Lisbon City Council, in October 1875, it was decided that \\"a great landmark of stone and bronze, to attest for posterity the bold achievements of those who distinguished themselves in 1640, setting us free\\" would be built on south end of the Public Promenade ‚Äî itself replaced by the Avenida da Liberdade, a Parisian-style boulevard, as the city expanded north in the 1880s. The obelisk was designed by Ant√≥nio Tom√°s da Fonseca, and two allegorical statues of Independence and of Victory were sculpted by Alberto Nunes and , respectively. ==Description== The monument stands on a square stone platform with truncated vertices, on which stand ornate iron streetlights, set on limestone plinths. The obelisk proper stands on a wide three-tiered base: the first two tiers mix concave and convex surfaces and bear, on the southern face, the inscription: EM 1886 POR SUBSCRIP√á√ÉO NACIONAL ERIGIU A COMMISS√ÉO CENTRAL PRIMEIRO DE DEZEMBRO DE 1640 (In 1886, by national subscription, this was erected by the Central Commission of 1 December 1640) The third tier features several pilasters, those in the corners decorated with carved laurel wreaths, topped by a cornice and a denticulate frieze. Above the base stand two bronze allegorical figures: the one on the southern face, a winged male draped in a flag and holding the broken chains of foreign domain, is Independence; the one on the northern face, a winged classically-dressed female figure holding a palm on one hand and a laurel wreath on the other, is Victory; the eastern and western faces show stone panoplies. Above the base, two parallelepipedal plinths are inscribed with allusions to the decisive battles of the Restoration War: 1 December 1640, the date of the Restoration of Independence, on the south face; 26 May 1644, the date of the Battle of Montijo, on the east face; 8 June 1663, the date of the Battle of Ameixial, on the west face; and 17 June 1665, the date of the Battle of Montes Claros, on the north face. The two plinths are topped by cornices supported by consoles. The obelisk proper stands above this array of plinths: it is 14.6 meters (48 ft) in height and it bears several inscriptions on each face, separated by decorative gooves, recalling important events of the war: on the southern face, along with the national arms, the inscriptions \\"Angra, 16 March 1642\\" and \\"Lisbon, 15 December 1640\\"; on the east face, \\"Badajoz, 22 July 1658\\", \\"Pernambuco, 17 January 1654\\", \\"Angola, 15 August 1648\\", \\"Santo Aleixo, 12 August 1641\\"; on the northern face, along with the municipal arms of Lisbon, the inscriptions \\"Peace Treaty, 13 February 1668\\", \\"Vila Vi√ßosa, 14 June 1665\\"; and on the western side, \\"Castelo Rodrigo, 7 July 1664\\", \\"Almeida, 2 July 1663\\", \\"√âvora, 4 June 1663\\", and \\"Elvas, 14 January 1659\\". ==See also== *Restauradores Square ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in Lisbon Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1886 Category:1886 establishments in Portugal Category:Obelisks in Portugal ","title":"Monument to the Restorers"},{"id":"35845889","text":"Dans Le Noir ?

The park is situated in the middle of the city, roughly 100 metres south of Haixiu Road. It has a total size of 102 hectares, and was created in 1996, the same year that Evergreen Park was completed. The most prominent features of the park are a cemetery, a 15.8-hectare lake, a zoo, and numerous, diverse forest areas. It is one of four major parks in Haikou, and can be compared to Haikou People's Park, due to its high percentage of tree cover. The other two, Baishamen Park and Evergreen Park, consist mostly of open grass fields. On the plateau at the top of the park is a pigeon aviary and a butterfly garden. About 96% of the park has green cover, much of which is forest area. ==Etymology== A local legend says that a fairy bull would appear on the mountain ridge during years of drought. It would summon up winds and call for rain to come. ==Features== *The park is one of the few elevated areas in an otherwise flat city. *Pigeon aviary and open, public area within which they flock *Animal zoo *Bamboo forest *Lake at the east side *Cemetery near the top of the mountain *Beneath the park is a water reserve. *Plaza for gatherings and exercise *Palm garden ==Flora and fauna== Bamboo forest The center of the park contains a large bamboo forest consisting of thousands of stands of bamboo, with natural pathways between. There are more than 140 families of trees and over 1,000 species. Dozens of individual forest areas exist, each predominantly containing one or two types of trees. There is also a pineapple and betel nut plantation, and a 3.5 hectare orchard containing sapodilla (in particular Manilkara zapota), lychee, carambola, and other fruit trees. Within this area is a 2.3 hectare jackfruit orchard. There is also a large plant nursery. The total green coverage of the land area of the park is over 96%. White pigeons are found in the area at the top of the park. Toads are commonly seen through the park. ==Battle of the Liberation on Hainan Island Martyrs' Cemetery== Memorial at the Martyrs' Cemetery Located within the park, this cemetery was established to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Hainan from the Japanese (December 31, 2008) and to cherish the memory of the martyrs who died for that cause. The creation of the cemetery was approved by the municipal government in March 2009. The total area of the squares and monuments is 4,200 square metres (70 metres long by 60 metres wide). The main monument is 16 metres tall, and was designed to resemble a boat hull crossing the sea, symbolizing the Landing Operation on Hainan Island. It also depicts the battles of Feng Baiju's \\"Qiongya Zongdui\\" (Hainan Independent Column). The construction was managed by the Haikou City Bureau of Civil Affairs and was designed by Beijing Zhen-Dong International Construction Design Ltd. The actual construction was done by the Sixth Urban Construction Engineering Bureau Group Co., Ltd. Members of Qiongya Zongdui and other troops who took part in the landing operation collaborated in the design and construction process. The construction took place between December 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010, taking a total of 120 days. The cost was 4.61 million yuan, 3.9 million of which was provided by the federal government, with the remaining 710,000 paid for by Hainan province. ==Haikou Golden Bull Ridge Zoo== Golden Bull Mountain Ridge Zoo This 7 hectare zoo is located on the plateau at the top of the park. It contains several small pavilions displaying monkeys, bears, zebras, deer, yak, reptiles, butterflies, water fowl, and dogs.

Specifically, each element has a random key associated with it in addition to its priority (which changes as a continuous function of time as in all kinetic data structures). The kinetic heater is then simultaneously a binary search tree on the element keys, and a heap on the element priorities. The kinetic heater achieves (expected) asymptotic performance bounds equal to the best kinetic priority queues. In practice however, it is less efficient since the extra random keys need to be stored, and the procedure to handle certificate failure is a (relatively complicated) rotation instead of a simple swap. == Implementation == If every element has a key and a priority associated with it, then there is a unique tree structure that is simultaneously a search tree on the keys and a heap on the priorities - this structure corresponds to the treap (if the priorities are randomly chosen) or the kinetic heater (if the keys are randomly chosen). The validity of the tree structure is ensured by creating a certificate at each edge that enforces the heap property on that edge. The main operational difference between a kinetic heap and a kinetic heater is in how they respond to certificate failures. When a certificate on an edge fails, a kinetic heater will perform a rotation around the nodes that failed (instead of the swap that a kinetic heap would perform). File:Rotation in a kinetic heater.png For example, consider the elements B (with parent F) and its left child D (with right child C). When the certificate [B>D] on the edge BD fails, the tree will be rotated around this edge. Thus in this case the resulting structure has D in place of B, C becomes a child of B instead ofD, and there are three certificate changes [B>D] replaced with [D>B], [D>C] replaced with [B>C] and [F>B] replaced with [F>D]. Everything else stays the same. == Analysis == This kinetic data structure is: * Responsive: There are O(1) certificate updates that need to be done when a certificate fails, which takes O(log n) time * Local: Each element is involved in O(1) certificates * Compact: There are O(n) total certificates * Efficient: It has the same (expected) asymptotic performance as kinetic hanger, kinetic tournament - for a collection of space-time trajectories where each pair intersects at most times, the kinetic heater processes events in time, where is a Davenport-Schinzel sequence. == References == Category:Kinetic data structures Category:Heaps (data structures) Category:Probabilistic data structures ","title":"Kinetic heater"},{"id":"35846433","text":"A Kinetic hanger is a randomized version of a kinetic heap whose performance is easy to analyze tightly. A kinetic hanger satisfies the heap property (the priority of each element is higher than the priority of its children) but relaxes the requirement that the tree structure must be strictly balanced, thus insertions and deletions can be randomized. As a result, the structure of the kinetic hanger has the property that it is drawn uniformly at random from the space of all possible heap-like structures on its elements. == Implementation == The kinetic hanger structure (including certificates and event queue) is exactly the same as the kinetic heap structure, but without the balancing requirement. Thus, it consists of an efficient priority queue (the event queue) to maintain the certificate failure times, as well as a main (not necessarily balanced) heap-like tree structure in which the elements are stored. There is a certificate associated with each edge that enforces the heap property (priority of parent > priority of child) along that edge. The characteristic operation in a kinetic hanger is \\"hanging\\", which is defined as follows (a distinction is made between a node in the tree structure and the element stored in it). Hang(Node n, Element e) # If there is no element at n, put e in n and return # If the element x in n has a higher priority than e, choose a child c of n randomly and recursively call Hang(c, e) # If the element x in n has a lower priority than e, put e in n choose a child c of n randomly and recursively call Hang(c, x) The main difference between the kinetic hanger and the kinetic heap is in the key operations, which are implemented as follows in a kinetic hanger: * Build-hanger: First sort elements by priority and then call hang on the root for each element in order. Then calculate and schedule certificate failure times in the event queue. This takes O(n log n) time, similar to a kinetic heap. * Insert: The kinetic hanger inserts top-down (instead of bottom-up) by \\"hanging\\" the new element at the root node. This takes O(log n) time, but O(log n) certificates might have to be changed on the way down, thus total time is O * Delete: This is a simpler operation than in a heap, since the balancing of tree structure doesn't need to be maintained. Thus, the element is simply replaced with the larger of its children, and then that child is recursively deleted. Again, this takes O(log n) time, but O(log n) certificates might have to be updated, so the total time is O. All these operations result in a uniformly random structure for the hanger, with an expected height of O(log n). == Analysis == This structure is: * Responsive: processing a certificate failure takes O(log n) time, just like in a kinetic heap * Local: each element is involved in O(1) certificates, just like in a kinetic heap * Compact: there are a total of O(n) certificates, just like in a kinetic heap * Efficient: it has the same efficiency as a kinetic tournament or kinetic heater - for a collection of space-time trajectories where each pair intersects at most times, the kinetic hanger processes events in time, where is a Davenport-Schinzel sequence == References == Category:Kinetic data structures Category:Heaps (data structures) Category:Probabilistic data structures ","title":"Kinetic hanger"},{"id":"35846435","text":"Nelson Woss at the 1st AACTA Awards 2012 Nelson Woss (born in Perth, Western Australia) is an Australian film producer who made the feature films Red Dog and Ned Kelly. ==Career== After graduating from Christ Church Grammar School, Nelson Woss attended the University of Western Australia before completing his education at Babson College in the United States. He first worked in the film industry at Village Roadshow in Los Angeles. Woss then worked for director Ivan Reitman's company Northern Lights, which, at the time, was based at Universal Pictures. In 2000, Woss set up his own independent production company, Endymion Films Inc, and executive produced the feature film Venus & Mars. Woss also developed and produced the screenplay for the hit computer game Abuse, which was marketed around the world. In 2002, Woss developed and produced the Australian feature film Ned Kelly for Universal Pictures. Woss produced the highly successful Australian feature film Red Dog. The film has made more than 21 million at the Australian box office since opening in August 2011. Red Dog is the eighth-highest grossing Australian film of all time and 11 days after opening, Red Dog became the highest grossing Australian film of 2011. In January 2012, Red Dog won Best Film at the 1st AACTA Awards and the AFI Members Choice award. Red Dog was officially released on DVD, Blu-ray and download on 1 December 2011 in Australia. The Red Dog DVD is the biggest- selling Australian DVD of all time. The DVD is also the third-highest selling DVD of all time in Australia behind Avatar (first) and Finding Nemo (second). A deal with Roadshow Entertainment and Coles saw one dollar from the sale of every DVD sold in Coles during December 2011 donated to the RSPCA. More than $17,000 was raised for the animal charity. In February 2012 Woss and Koko, the canine star of Red Dog, visited RSPCA to present a cheque for the money raised. In March 2012, it was announced that Woss was working with Australian theatre producer John Frost to adapt Red Dog into a stage musical. Woss is president of Endymion Films Inc. and its Australian counterpart Woss Group Film Productions. Woss lives in Perth, Western Australia. Up until his death in December 2012, Koko (dog) the canine star of Red Dog also lived with Woss. The two were inseparable and Woss was reportedly devastated when Koko died. Woss and Koko were the subject of a portrait by acclaimed Australian artist Adam Cullen. The painting was a finalist for the 2012 Archibald Prize. In 2015 Woss teamed up with director Kriv Stenders (Red Dog), (Kill Me Three Times) and writer Dan Taplitz (Red Dog) to produce Red Dog: True Blue, a prequel to Red Dog. Red Dog: True Blue was theatrically released in 2017. The film grossed over AUD8M at the Australian box office and has become a perennial family film. It has been distributed around the world and won the Grand Prize at the 2012 Heartland Film Festival In 2014 Woss set up a new company, Good Dog Distribution, to jointly distribute Red Dog: True Blue along with Roadshow Distribution. In 2019, Woss produced an ultra-low budget mockumentary about his dog. Koko (dog). Koko: A Red Dog Story was theatrically released in Australia and has become a cult film.

The gold medal at the 2010 South Asian Games was the first ever gold medal of any Afghan sports team in the history of the country. ==History== Basketball was first played in Afghanistan in 1936. In 1966, the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee (ANOC) founded the first national basketball team after receiving challenges from India and Pakistan. Tom Gouttierre, an American Peace Corps volunteer and coach of the team at Habibia High School, became the first coach. Using detailed, confidential instructions from John Wooden, the Afghan team became the only other to run the famous UCLA zone press. Although the international games were canceled, in 1969 Gouttierre returned on a Fulbright Fellowship and again became the Habibia coach, and in 1970 Bill Bradley of the New York Knicks tutored the team while visiting the country. That year China challenged the ANOC. Because of the lack of preparation time, Gouttierre decided that current and former Habibia players were the best choice for a second Afghan national team. Using the zone press, it defeated a much larger Chinese team in Parwan Province in the Afghan team's first international victory. ==Competitive recordSummer Olympics=World championships=== yet to qualify ===FIBA Asia Championship=== yet to qualify ===Asian Games=== *1970-2002 : Did not qualify *2006 : 13th *2010 : 13th *2014 : Did not qualify *2018 : To be determined ===South Asian Games=== *1995-2004 : Did not participate *2010 : 1st 16px *2018 : To be determined ==Honours== * 2010 South Asian Games: Gold Medal ==Head coach position== * Mamo Rafiq ‚Äì 2007-now ==See also== * Afghanistan women's national basketball team ==External links== *Asia-basket - Afghanistan Men National Team *Presentation on Facebook ===Videos=== * Afghanistan Basketball Team Youtube.com video ==References== Category:National basketball teams Basketball Category:Basketball teams in Afghanistan Category:Basketball in Afghanistan Category:1966 establishments in Afghanistan ","title":"Afghanistan men's national basketball team"},{"id":"35846450","text":"The is a Japanese thoroughbred horse race on dirt track only for three years old.

The monument was erected in 1870. == History and details == King Peter IV, called \\"o galheteiro\\" (\\"the cruet-stand\\") by Lisboners, in a c. 1860 photograph. King John VI had a monument to the Constitution built in 1821 on the spot the column stands today, which was rased two years later by the same king, after Infante Michael of Portugal (supported by Queen Carlota Joaquina) successfully led a counter-revolution to reinstate the absolute monarchy. A first monument to King Peter IV was erected in 1852, with Queen Mary II (King Peter's daughter) laying the cornerstone. The monument consisted simply of a pedestal, which the Lisboners referred to as \\"o galheteiro\\" (\\"the cruet-stand\\") due to its ungraceful form. This primitive monument was demolished in 1864, after serving as the base for a temporary statue of Hymenaeus during the wedding ceremonies of King Peter V in 1858 and King Louis I in 1862. The current marble statue was erected on top of a 75-foot (~ 23 metres) column in 1870. The statue is of Peter IV, King of Portugal, who was also the first Emperor of Brazil, as Peter I. His bronze statue stands atop of a tall Corinthian order column, depicting him in a general's uniform and royal cloak, his head crowned in laurels, and holding the Constitutional Charter of 1826 in his right hand. At the base of the column, there are the four female allegorical figures of Justice, Wisdom, Strength, and Moderation, qualities attributed to the King. There is an urban legend that the statue atop the Column of King Pedro IV had actually been originally designed for the Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. As the Mexican emperor was shot in 1867, shortly before the completion of the statue, it is said that the statue was then bought for the beautification of Rossio Square. Several historians, such as Jos√© Augusto, have proved this urban legend to be incorrect, pointing out the details of the statue that clearly symbolize the Portuguese King, such as the Portuguese Coat of Arms on the buttons, the collar of the Order of the Tower and Sword, and the Constitutional Charter of 1826, penned by Peter himself. == See also == * Rossio Square *Monument to Pedro IV in Porto ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in Lisbon ","title":"Column of Pedro IV"},{"id":"35846518","text":"Pink Lipstick () is a 2010 South Korean television drama starring Park Eun- hye, Lee Joo-hyun, Park Gwang-hyun and Seo Yoo-jung.

Known as \\"Denver Ed Martin\\" and \\"The Colorado Giant\\", Martin was born in Denver on September 10, 1881. His height was listed as , while some sources report that he was 6' 6\\" or 6' 6¬Ω\\" tall. Martin was a strong boxer with renowned footwork who was a strong puncher. ==World Colored Heavyweight Champ== Martin made his debut against former colored heavyweight champ Bob Armstrong on 6 June 1899 at the Lenox Athletic Club in New York City and was knocked out in the second round. He became the colored heavyweight champ when he beat title-holder Frank Childs in a bout in Chicago on 25 February 1902, out-pointing the champ in a six-round contest. He defended the colored heavyweight title against rival Bob Armstrong at the Crystal Palace in London on 25 July 1902. According to the Associated Press coverage of the fight: > \\"Martin proved the cleverer and never gave his opponent a chance, being > declared an easy winner on points at the close of the fifteenth round; > Martin, it is announced, will challenge the winner of the Jeffries- > Fitzsimmons fight in San Francsico.\\" World heavyweight champ James J. Jeffries, who had fought Armstrong and other African American boxers on the way up through the ranks, maintained the color bar erected by bare-knuckles champ John L. Sullivan, though Martin was not given a title shot. Instead, he met Armstrong for a rematch in Philadelphia on 10 December. According to the Daily Gazette and Bulletin: > \\"The bout was fast from the start and both men narrowly escaped a knockout. > The bell saved Armstrong in the third and fifth and Martin was floored six > times in the fourth round.\\" The six-round bout ended in a no decision. In his next fight, Martin lost his title to Jack Johnson in a decision after 20 rounds. The two fighters treated each other cautiously in the first 10 rounds, but Johnson dropped Martin in the 11th with a right hand to the neck. It was the first of five times he hit the canvas in that round. With his footwork, Martin managed to go the distance, but lost the title. Martin met Johnson in a rematch for the colored heavyweight title match in Los Angeles on 18 October 1904 and was knocked out in the second round. In addition to the colored heavyweight title, he shared the distinction with Johnson of having beaten future Oscar winner Victor McLaglen in the ring, before the pugilist turned to acting. Johnson beat McLaglen in a six-round exhibition in 1909, while Martin knocked out McLaglen in the third round of a scheduled 20-round bout in Aberdeen, Washington the year before. Johnson broke the color bar in 1908 when he beat Canadian Tommy Burns and became the first African American heavyweight champion of the world. As the heavyweight champ, Johnson dodged African American heavyweights too, though it was on the basis that a fight between two black boxers would prove a bust at the box office. Just like Jeffries, he did not give Martin a shot at the world heavyweight title, either. ==Retirement and comeback== Martin retired in 1914, after a loss to Englishman Tom Cowler, \\"The Cumberland Giant\\", who knocked him out in the second round. He moved to the Portland, Oregon area, where he kept his hand in the fight game and refereed fights. He staged a comeback in Oregon in 1921, winning three fights, all by knock-outs. None of the fights went more than four rounds. Martin's last fight was similar to his first in that it involved a fellow colored heavyweight champ. On 18 November 1921, he met colored heavyweight champ Harry Wills in a ten-round bout in Milwaukie, Oregon. Wills knocked Martin down six times before knocking him out in the first round. He retired with a record of 23 wins (17 by KO), nine losses (eight by KO) and three + draws. He also won two newspaper decisions. ==References== Category:Boxers from Colorado Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:African-American boxers Category:World colored heavyweight boxing champions Category:1881 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Place of death missing Category:American male boxers ","title":"Ed Martin (boxer)"},{"id":"35846544","text":"A Kinetic Priority Queue is an abstract kinetic data structure. It is a variant of a priority queue designed to maintain the maximum (or minimum) priority element (key-value pair) when the priority of every element is changing as a continuous function of time. Kinetic priority queues have been used as components of several kinetic data structures, as well as to solve some important non-kinetic problems such as the k-set problem and the connected red blue segments intersection problem. == Implementations == The operations supported are: * : create an empty kinetic priority queue * (or find-min): - return the (or for a ) value stored in the queue at the current virtual time . * : - insert a key into the kinetic queue at the current virtual time, whose value changes as a continuous function of time . * - delete a key at the current virtual time . There are several variants of kinetic priority queues, which support the same basic operations but have different performance guarantees. Some of the most common implementations are kinetic heaps which are simple to implement but don't have tight theoretical performance bounds, and their randomized variants - kinetic heaters and kinetic hangers - which are easier to analyze. There is also a heap-like structure based on the dynamic convex hull data structure which achieves better performance for affine motion of the priorities, but doesn't support curved trajectories. The kinetic tournament is another commonly used implementation. It achieves, deterministically, the same performance bounds as the heater or hanger, however it is less local and responsive than the heap- based data-structures. {  border=\\"1\\" + Time complexities of kinetic priority queue implementations !

It is found living freely in the north Atlantic and Pacific Oceans but is also parasitic, being found inside the gonads of starfish. ==Biology== Orchitophrya stellarum tolerates a sea temperature range of between and and a salinity range of between 2 and at least 30 parts per thousand of salt equivalent. The lower the temperature, the lower the acceptable level of salinity. Growth is most rapid at 24 ¬∞C. It is a facultative parasite of sea stars in the Asteriidae family. It seems to be able to survive in the open sea indefinitely as long as there is a supply of bacteria and tissue detritus on which it can feed. ==Parasitism== Orchitophrya stellarum is often associated with sea stars and other invertebrates, living on their outer surface and feeding on sloughed-off epidermal tissue. It only appears to become parasitic when the male host starfish has ripe gonads. It probably enters the starfish through the gonopores, the orifices where gametes are released. There may be a pheromone that alerts it to the fact that the testes are ripe and causes it to change its behaviour. As different species of starfish breed at different times of year, Orchitophrya stellarum may move from one species to another in accordance with their reproductive cycles. In the Pacific Ocean, it may alternate between parasitising Evasterias troscheli and Pisaster ochraceus during the spring and summer and Leptasterias spp. in the winter. In the Atlantic Ocean, the winter host may again be Leptasterias spp. but the spring and summer hosts are likely to be Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens. The ciliate has been found in the testes of all these species. When inside the gonad, it phagocytoses the sperm thus rendering the starfish infertile. Researchers have found skewed sex ratios of affected populations with fewer males than females being found, and males being consistently smaller than females. The researchers thought it likely that there was increased mortality among infected males. In 2006, a mass die-off of the purple sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) occurred off the coast of British Columbia. Parasitism by Orchitophrya stellarum was considered to be the likely cause. A marine parasite expert stated that the starfish was an important member of the marine community and that if it were removed, marine biodiversity in the area would be threatened. In a study published in 2013, Ochitophrya stellarum, the parasitic ciliate, was discovered in 2007 in the tissues of blue crabs. Hemolymph smears showed the ciliates of the parasite. This was surprising, because ochitophrya stellarum was previously only associated with infecting sea stars. This opportunistic pathogen was responsible for a number of histophagous scuticociliate infections in the blue crabs. The infections were present in the hemal sinuses of all tissues of the blue crabs and in between muscle fibers. ==Use as a biological control== The north Pacific sea star, Asterias amurensis, was first seen in Tasmania in 1986 and is spreading along the coasts of southern Australia. It is considered an invasive species that is threatening local biodiversity. Biological pest control of the starfish is being considered through the introduction of Orchitophrya stellarum, however its ability to regulate sea star populations is uncertain. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:Oligohymenophorea Category:Parasitic eukaryotes Category:Species described in 1907 ","title":"Orchitophrya stellarum"},{"id":"35846728","text":"Paul Copu (born 7 August 1953) is a Romanian former middle distance runner who competed in the 1980 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Olympic athletes of Romania Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Romanian male middle- distance runners Category:Romanian male steeplechase runners Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade gold medalists for Romania Category:Medalists at the 1979 Summer Universiade Category:Medalists at the 1977 Summer Universiade ","title":"Paul Copu"},{"id":"35846751","text":"Fabien Paschal (born April 17, 1991 in Creteil, France) is a French basketball player who plays for French Pro A League club Le Havre.profil www.lnb.fr sports reference retrieved 17 May 2012 ==Career== Paschal signed a 3-year contract with BCM Gravelines in May 2014. ==References== Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:BCM Gravelines players Category:French men's basketball players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:STB Le Havre players ","title":"Fabien Paschal"},{"id":"35846769","text":"John Gregorek (born 15 April 1960) is an American former middle-distance runner who competed in the Summer Olympics in 1980 (boycotted) and 1984.

The 5‚Ä≤9¬Ω‚Ä≥ boxer fought out of Bridgeport, Connecticut as a heavyweight, though he would be considered a light heavyweight under modern classifications. ==Fights with Morris Grant== Hadley won the colored heavyweight championship from Morris Grant, whom he fought twelve times between 1881 and 1883. Their first recorded match was January 14, 1881, when Hadley won points in a three-rounder and claimed the Grant's title. Hadley fought Grant a 10 more times while he was the colored champ, beating him eight times. In their seventh fight, held on May 4, 1882 in New York City, their four-rounder was declared a no-contest. Their next fight, on June 20 of the same year, saw Morris finally beat the undefeated Hadley (whose \\"official\\" record was 12-0-2 at the time), besting the champ on points in a four rounder. Hadley apparently did not put his belt at stake for the fight, for he continued as champion until 1883, when he was finally bested by George \\"Old Chocolate\\" Godfrey. Morris lost three more fights to Hadley during his championship reign and one after Hadley lost his title to Godfrey. The last time they battled while Hadley was the colored champ was on December 7, 1882, when they fought in New York City for the Police Gazette Medal Championship of America. Hadley KO-ed Morris in the third round. Their last fight was on December 8, 1883-12-08, exactly one year and one day after they had last met in the ring. Morris apparently was outpointed by the ex-champ and retired from pro boxing. ==Record== In a career that lasted from 1869 to 1891, Hadley racked up a record of 25 wins (14 by knock- out) against 13 losses (being KO-ed five times) with six draws. ==Legacy & Honors== In 2020 award-winning author Mark Allen Baker published the first comprehensive account of The World Colored Heavyweight Championship, 1876-1937, with McFarland & Company, a leading independent publisher of academic & nonfiction books. This history traces the advent and demise of the Championship, the stories of the talented professional athletes who won it, and the demarcation of the color line both in and out of the ring. For decades the World Colored Heavyweight Championship was a useful tool to combat racial oppression-the existence of the title a leverage mechanism, or tool, used as a technique to counter a social element, ‚Äúdrawing the color line.‚Äù ==References== Category:1846 births Category:Boxers from Tennessee Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:African-American boxers Category:World colored heavyweight boxing champions Category:Sportspeople from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Year of death missing Category:American male boxers ","title":"Charles Hadley"},{"id":"35846826","text":"Giuseppe Maffei (born 28 January 1974) is an Italian former middle distance runner, mainly specialized in 3000 metres steeplechase He won two medals at the International athletics competitions. ==Biography== He competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics and in the 2004 Summer Olympics, he has 12 caps in national team from 1995 to 2004. ==National titles== Giuseppe Maffei has won one time the individual national championship. *1 win in 3000 metres steeplechase (2001) ==See also== * Italian all-time lists - 3000 metres steeplechase ==References * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Italian male middle-distance runners Category:Italian male steeplechase runners Category:Olympic athletes of Italy Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Mediterranean Games bronze medalists for Italy Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1997 Mediterranean Games Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Italy Category:Mediterranean Games medalists in athletics Category:Universiade gold medalists for Italy Category:Medalists at the 1999 Summer Universiade ","title":"Giuseppe Maffei"},{"id":"35846831","text":"The village church in Landow The church from the east The village church of Landow () is the Evangelical parish church of the parish of Rambin in the south of the German island of R√ºgen. It is located in the village of Landow in the municipality of Dreschvitz. It was built as a Wegekirche in Landow around the year 1312. A Wegekirche is a church which is designed such that the location of the priest and congregation gives the impression that they are on their way to the Lord, facing the Christ, usually in the symbolic form of a cross or painting. In 2004, dendrochronological research of the oak timber- framing was carried out. This demonstrated that the church is one of the oldest on the island of R√ºgen and may be the oldest timber-framed church building in North Germany and the entire southeast Baltic Sea region. The church was sited on an old salt and herring trading route. It was first mentioned in the records when reference was made to a priest at Landow ...plebane (Priester) in Landaue dating to the year 1333. In 1369 a Kaland Brotherhood was mentioned, something which was important for churches in the Middle Ages. The original timber-framed of the building was bricked in around 1542. The interior was decorated in the baroque style in the 18th century. The altar, font, pulpit and painted wooden ceiling of the church all came from the workshop of the most important Pomeranian sculptor of the baroque style, Elias Kessler from the town of Stralsund. The vestry attached to the church later became a crypt chapel for the family of the church patrons. After 1945, the coffins were removed from the crypt chapel and buried in the cemetery. During the GDR period, major repairs were carried out, most recently in 1959 on the church roof. In the late 1960s, the continued preservation of the church building became an issue. The consistory of the Evangelical Church of Greifswald felt in 1970 that it was no longer in a position to fund the preservation of the isolated church building. In 1982 the church was assessed as in danger of collapse and, in the 1980s, it was also removed from the county monument list. The church is now supported by a preservation society. Various events are held in it, including concerts as part of the Mecklenburg- Vorpommern Festival. The cemetery and its graves, some of which are very old, are also worth seeing. == Parish == The Evangelical parish belongs to the church district of Stralsund within the Pomeranian Evangelical Church. == See also == * List of churches on R√ºgen == Literature == * Ulrike Reinfeldt: Die Dorfkirche zu Landow.

It was also known as Il Maestro di Don Giovanni (\\"The Teacher of Don Juan\\") and The Golden Blade. ==Plot== The film is set in medieval Italy, in the duchess of Sidona. Raniero and Renzo are two friends who have been travelling together for two years, having adventures, fighting duels and womanizing. Raniero is the son of the Duke of Sidona, and the elder Renzo his Don Juan-type mentor. On their way back to Sidona after a two-year absence, Renzo and Raniero encounter Fulvia, a former lover of Renzo. She attacks him then invites him to her estate. Fulvia's rich husband Gennarelli is at a meeting at Sidona. Pavoncello, the Duke's counselor, is suggesting a new law where all men under twenty must marry and produce children or face imprisonment. (The aim is to ensure future manpower to defend the duchy). The Duke is unsure whether the law is what the people want and refuses to sign it until he consults them. Gennarelli returns to his estate and surprises Renzo and his wife. The two men fight a duel which Renzo easily wins. Renzo and Raniero head to the castle where the Duke welcomes them. The Duke's daughter, Francesca, regards Renzo as a bad influence on her brother but is attracted to him. Fulvia arranges a joust with Indian sticks between Renzo and Pavoncello, who wants to marry Francesca. Both men are wounded and the duke stops the contest. Gennarelli approaches Pavoncello, suggesting he use the proposed law to drive Renzo out of Sidona. Gennarelli and Pavoncello join forces to persuade the Duke to sign the law. Renzo flees Sidona with Raniero. Pavoncello hires an assassin, Lenzi, to kill Renzo and Raniero. It is revealed Pavoncello wants to take over Sidona and surrounding areas as well; he arranges Lenzi to hire two hundred mercenaries. Renzo and Raniero are eating in a tavern when attacked by Lenzi's men but they defeat them. They return to the castle and overhear Fulvia talking to Gennarelli about the latter's plan with Pavoncello. Renzo and Raniero are captured. Lenzi's mercenary army enters Sidona, and imprisons the Duke and Francesca. Fulvia helps Renzo and Raniero to escape. They manage to rescue the Duke and Francesca and lead an uprising. Francesca uses the women of Sidona to seduce Lenzi's mercenaries. This enables Renzo to kill Lenzi, and for Raniero to raise the Duke's loyal supporters in rebellion. Renzo kills Pavoncello in a sword duel.

In 1952 it was announced Krims would make The Ninth Man with Errol Flynn in the lead for Constellation Films with J. Barrett Mahon to act on Flynn's behalf behind the scenes. In January 1953 it was announced Flynn would star in Teacher of Don Juan, a co production between Errol Flynn Enterprises and Vittorio Vasserotti. Flynn produced the film in association with Barry Mahon in an attempt to emulate the success of The Adventures of Don Juan (1948), which had sold well in Europe on its release by Warner Bros.. John Bash helped Flynn finance the film. ===Shoot=== Filming took place in Italy in February 1953.

Dorothy Kilgallen later wrote that Flynn's share from the film \\"amounts to quite a pile of bills\\" but he never received the money because \\"they're all Washington-bound to defray his staggering tax debt.\\" ===Legacy=== The experience prompted Flynn to try another production in Italy, the disastrous William Tell. Shortly after the shoot Flynn's wife gave birth to a baby girl. ==References*Review of film at Variety Category:Swashbuckler films Category:1950s historical adventure films Category:Italian historical adventure films Category:Films set in the 16th century Category:Films set in Italy Category:Italian films Category:Films shot at Cinecitt√† Studios Category:Titanus films ","title":"Crossed Swords (1954 film)"},{"id":"35846895","text":"Thomas Trauttmann (born October 1, 1991 in Mulhouse, France) is a French basketball player who plays for French Pro A League club Strasbourg.profil www.lnb.fr sports reference retrieved 17 May 2012 ==References== Category:French men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Mulhouse Category:1991 births Category:Living people ","title":"Thomas Trauttmann"},{"id":"35846900","text":"Dmitriy Pavlovich Stukalov (; born 2 May 1951 in Leningrad) is a Russian former hurdler who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Soviet male hurdlers Category:Russian male hurdlers Category:Olympic athletes of the Soviet Union Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade gold medalists for the Soviet Union Category:Universiade bronze medalists for the Soviet Union ","title":"Dmitry Stukalov"},{"id":"35846905","text":"Lilacs in the Spring is a 1954 British musical film starring Anna Neagle and Errol Flynn. It was the first of two movies the stars made together, the other being King's Rhapsody. It was released in the US as Let's Make Up. It was the feature film debut of (the then-unknown) Sean Connery. ==Plot== A young actress, Carole Beaumont, is wooed by actor-producer Charles King but she is unsure how she feels about him. During an air raid in the Blitz, a bomb explosion rocks the cafe and Carole is knocked unconscious. In her confused state, fantasies flash through her mind, and she seems to become Nell Gwyn of Old Drury, with Charles King looking very much like King Charles. Recovering, she is advised by her doctor to take a rest in the country and, there, another beau, Albert Gutman, prompts his grandmother, Lady Drayton (Helen Haye), to invite Carole to their family home at Windsor. She accepts and telephones Charles but hangs up when his phone is answered by a female voice. Looking out on Windsor Castle, she sees herself as the young Queen Victoria and Albert as Prince Albert. Influenced by her day-dream, she accepts Albert's proposal. Charles arrives to tell her that all arrangements are made for her to leave with him and the company for Burma, but she refuses saying she will never marry an actor. Barmaid Kate tells Charles why Carole feels the way she does about actors: Carole's mother, Lillian Grey, was with a touring show in 1913 when the handsome star, John Beaumont raised her from the chorus to be his partner in his first West End show. They were a success, fell in love and were married. But the war soon took Beau off to Flanders and Lillian was left to become a great star on her own. Carole was born in wartime, but saw little of her busy mother. ==Cast== *Anna Neagle as Carole Beaumont/Lillian Grey/Queen Victoria/Nell Gwyn *Errol Flynn as John Beaumont *David Farrar as Charles King/King Charles II *Kathleen Harrison as Kate *Peter Graves as Albert Gutman/Prince Albert *Helen Haye as Lady Drayton *Scott Sanders as Old George *Alma Taylor as Woman in theater audience *Hetty King as Woman in theater audience *Alan Gifford as Hollywood director *Jennifer Mitchell as Young Carole *Gillian Harrison as Carole as child *Sam Kydd Uncredited ==The Glorious Days== The script was based on the stage musical The Glorious Days, which had been a big success for Neagle, running for two years and 467 performances. It referenced several earlier hits of Neagle, including Nell Gwynn (1934) and Victoria the Great (1937). ==Production== The film was made by Everest Pictures, a new production company from producer-director Herbert Wilcox. Wilcox had just made three films in collaboration with Republic Pictures, and hoped for them to finance films of two Ivor Novello musicals he had purchased. When this did not happen, he was forced to obtain finance from British Lion. Neagle and Wilcox guaranteed a loan of ¬£75,000 to make the film.

The movie was also known as Night in Havana. ==Plot== Ned Sherwood, a blackjack dealer in a Havana casino, is given some counterfeit peso bills by a woman. He confronts the woman with the fact they are counterfeit, but she denies it and leaves. That night, on his way home, two thugs attack Ned but run off when the police are summoned. Guillermo Mastegui, Chief of the Secret Section of the Cuban National Police, interrogates Ned about the attack and accuses him of being involved in a plan to flood Cuba with worthless currency. Mastegui and a U.S. Treasury agent plan to have Ned followed in the hope that he will lead them to the head counterfeiter. Ned loses his job and can't leave Cuba. He meets with a young woman, Anita Ferrer, who believes that he has the bills, as well as the engraving plates they were made from, and offers to buy them. Anita takes him to meet her father, who is president of the Bank of Cuba. Se√±or Ferrer explains to Ned that Mastegui suspects that three million counterfeit pesos, manufactured in Chicago, are about to be laundered through the bank. Because this act would destroy confidence in the bank and in the government, Ferrer is anxious to discover who is behind the plot. Ned tells Ferrer that he knows nothing about the matter and is about to leave when Ferrer's other daughter, Josefina, returns home and Ned recognizes her as the woman who passed him the notes in the casino, but says nothing. When \\"Fina\\" agrees to a meeting with Ned, she again denies any involvement in the counterfeiting, but offers to be seen with him in the hope of having the ringleaders show their hand. After visiting several nightclubs, Fina admits that she took the counterfeit money from the pocket of Carlos Rubi, her sister's boyfriend. Upon leaving a club, Ned and Fina are kidnapped by Miguel Collada, a trusted banking aide of her father, and his henchman Chuchu. Collada reveals that he is behind the scheme to substitute the counterfeit bills, which have now been chemically aged, for bundles of old, withdrawn bills that are to be burned under his supervision. He will then keep the genuine, old currency, but fears that his associate, Rubi, may have stolen the plates, which could connect him to the swindle. To help Ned, with whom she is falling in love, Fina suggests to Collada that Rubi may have hidden the plates in El Morro Castle where Rubi, she and Anita used to play as children. Meanwhile, Anita meets with Rubi to try to extricate themselves from Collada's scheme in which they became involved in order to pay off substantial debts. After Collada and Fina depart for El Morro, leaving Chuchu to guard Ned, Rubi comes to the house intending to kill Collada, but is shot and killed by Chuchu. Ned escapes, alerts Mastegui, then goes with Anita to El Morro. When they catch up with Collada and Fina, Collada uses Fina as a shield during a gunfight. Anita tries to bargain with him, but is killed by Collada. Ned jumps on Collada and they fight on the castle's parapet until Collada falls, with the plates, into the sea and is eaten by sharks. To protect Ferrer from the knowledge of Anita's wrongdoing, Mastegui declares that she has died a hero and considers the case closed.

The Cuban government, via its cultural representative in the US, Roberto Hernandez, approached Sylvester, offering facilities and possibly some financing for a movie version of The Big Boodle. Sylvester was enthusiastic, stating that \\"in addition to having all that colorful, authentic scenery and police clearance and co operation - always a big help - the picture could be made inexpensively.

Emicho was the founder of the elder line of Nassau-Hadamar. He was a cousin of King Adolf of Germany. He and his brother Henry fought on Adolf's side in the Battle of G√∂llheim on 2 July 1298.Wagner, p. 38 == Count of Nassau-Hadamar == Emicho I was a son of Otto, the founder of the Ottonian line of the House of Nassau. After Otto died in 1290, his sons fought a length dispute over the inheritance. In 1303, the three remaining sons divided the Ottonian lands. Henry (d. 1343), the eldest brother, received Nassau-Siegen, with Ginsburg and the Lordship of Westerwald. John received Nassau-Dillenburg, with Herborn, Haiger and Beilstein. Emicho received Nassau-Hadamar, including Hadamar itself, the Esterau, the Nassau share of the Lordship of Driedorf and the justice over Ellar, the Ottonian share of Dausenau and Ems and some dispersed possessions. As recently as 1290, the Lords of Greifenstein, who were co- owners of Driedorf, had forced Henry and Emicho to demolish two of their castles in Driedorf. On the other hand, a treaty closed in Wetzlar promised an end to the Greinfenstein's resistance to the Nassau expansion in the eastern part of the Westerwald.W. Sauer: Die Herren von Beilstein und Greifenstein, in: Annalen des Vereins f√ºr Nassauische Altertumskunde und Geschichtsforschung, vol. 28, Wiesbaden, 1896, pp. 1‚Äì52 (esp. 26‚Äì27), Online In 1316, Emicho finally managed to purchase the Greifenstein share of Driedorf for 250 marks. == Properties in Franconia == In 1299, Emicho acquire considerable properties in the Nuremberg area, when King Albert I of Saxony mortgaged Kammerstein Castle, Schwabach, Altdorf, Kornburg Castle and the town of Kornburg to Emicho and his wife Anna, who was the daughter of Burgrave Frederick III of NurembergOn 30 January 1299, King Albert sealed a deed stating that the owed Emich and his wife 300 silver marks, using Nuremberg weights, see: Wirtembergisches Urkundenbuch, vol. 11, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart, 1913, Nr. 5226, Online == Hadamar == South wing of Hadamar Castle On 18 December 1320 Emicho purchased a model farm from the Cistercian Eberbach Abbey. This farm was located on the left bank of the Elbbach, opposite Hadamar. The transaction includes the St. Giles church in Hadamar; the abbey retained various other properties in Niederhadamar, Faulbach and Niederzeuzheim. Emich expanded the farm to a water castle named Hadamar Castle, and built a new farm to the south of the castle. He moved his residence to Hadamar Castle. In 1324, Emperor Louis IV granted city rights, modeled on Frankfurt, to Hadamar and Ems. This allowed Emicho to fortify Hadamar with a city wall and a moat surrounding both the town and his castle. The move to Hadamar was probably intended to make it easier to secure his interests in the County of Dietz and to continue purchasing property and rights from the House of Dietz, which was continually in financial difficulties. From 1317, Emicho acted as guardian of Count Gottfried V of Dietz (1303‚Äì1348), whose bad financial management had caused the decline of his county. In 1324, Emicho negotiated with Count Gottfried V of Dietz about the intended marriage of Emicho's daughter Jutta with Gottfried's son Gerhard VI (1317‚Äì1343). Emicho demanded extended guardianship rights over the County of Dietz, which was already owed him a considerable amount of money. When Gottfried reached adulthood in 1332 and Emicho's guardianship ended, Gottfried transferred his rights over Hadamar and the village of Dehrn to Emicho. On 28 March 1337, Gottfried of Dietz mortgaged the district of Ellar, which he had acquired this district only four years earlier from the Lords of Merenberg, for 1450 Limburgish marks to Emicho's son John. On 4 April 1334, only two months before his death, Emicho transferred the Court and Castle of Hadamar to Archbishop Baldwin of Trier, who gave it back to him as a fief. == Mining rights == On 26 February 1298, King Adolph of Germany mortgaged the rights to the Ratzenscheid mine near Wilnsdorf in the Siegerland area and the other silver mines in the Nassau territory to his cousins Henry and Emicho for 1000 marks worth of pennies from CologneDeed from 26 February 1298 == John's inheritance == Emicho's younger brother John was captain in the army from Nassau and Mainz that fought in the decisive Battle of Wetzlar that ended the Dernbacher Feud on 10 August 1328. John fell in that battle. Emicho refrained from his share in the inheritance, in favour of his elder brother Henry. == Marriage and issue == Before 1297, Emich married Anna (d. ), the daughter of Burgrave Frederick III of Nuremberg and his second wife Helen, the daughter of Duke Albert I of Saxony. They had at least eight children:Ernst Hermann M√ºnch: Geschichte des Hauses Nassau-Oranien, vol. 2, Jacob Anton Mayer, Aachen and Leipzig, 1832, pp. 287‚Äì288, Online * Anna (died probably before 1329), married before 1332 to Count Kuno I of Falkenstein * Jutta (d. after 1359), married before 1324 to Count Gerhard VI of Diez (1317‚Äì1343) * John (d. before 20 January 1365), Count of Nassau-Hadamar from 1334 to 1365 * Emicho II (d. 1359), from 1328 to 1336 canon in Mainz, from 1337 to 1359 co-ruler of Nassau- Hadamar * Agnes, a nun in Altenberg Abbey in Wetzlar * Helen, also a nun in Altenberg Abbey * Margaret, married before 1349 to a Count Hohenberg * Margaretha (d. 1343), a nun in the Poor Clares nunnery in Nuremberg Emicho died on 7 June 1334. His widow reached a compromise with her son John in 1336, in which she received the imperial Kammerstein Castle as her jointure, plus several manors in Franconia. She would also receive income in kind from John, from his possessions in Laurenburg, Dausenau, Hadamar, Nentershausen and the bailiwick of Weidenhahn and from farms and land in Hadamar (the manors Schnepfenhaus and R√∂dchen), Zeuzheim and Heftrich.

It was originally described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1795. ==Description== Clavaria fumosa has a fruiting body which is in height and in width. These bodies are to a greater or lesser extent cylindrical, taper at the base and are normally unbranched, they are infrequently flattened or have grooves and are usually smooth. They can be dry or moist are normally rather brittle with a blunt tip the tip. The colour can be greyish, off-white, dirty yellowish, or dirty pinkish, although they are paler at the base while the tip becomes darker reddish brown or even black as it ages. The flesh is the same colour as the exterior and does not have a distinct odour or taste while the spores are white. ==Distribution== Clavaria fumosa is a common species in Britain and Ireland and is also widely distributed mainland Europe and also from North America. ==Habitat and biology== Clavaria fumosa is a saprobic fungus which grows on the soil among unimproved grassland and in leaf litter along the edges of woodland, it is less common in dense woodland. This species is normally found in clusters and solitary specimens are rare. In Britain and Ireland the fruiting bodies appear from June to November. ==Edibility== Clavaria fumosa is said to be edible, but as a relatively scarce and small species then their collection for culinary uses is not though to be worthwhile. Others consider it to be inedible. ==Etymology== The generic name is derived from the Latin clava meaning \\"club\\" while the specific epithet fumosa means \\"smoky\\". ==References * Category:Clavariaceae Category:Fungi described in 1795 Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America ","title":"Clavaria fumosa"},{"id":"35847158","text":"The GEMS American Academy is a for-profit private school in Khalifa City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

In 2D, the width of a point set is the minimum distance between two parallel lines that contain the point set in the strip between them. For the two dimensional case, the kinetic data structure for kinetic convex hull can be used to construct a kinetic data structure for the width of a point set that is responsive, compact and efficient. ==2D case== Consider the parallel lines which contain the point set in the strip between them and are of minimal distance apart. One of the lines must contain an edge ab of the convex hull, and the other line must go through a point c of the convex hull such that (a,c) and (b,c) are antipodal pairs. ab and c are referred to as an antipodal edge-vertex pair. Consider the dual of the point set. The points dualize to lines and the convex hull of the points dualizes to the upper and lower envelope of the set of lines. The vertices of the upper convex hull dualize to segments on the upper envelope. The vertices of the lower convex hull dualize to segments on the lower envelope. The range of slopes of the supporting lines of a point on the hull dualize to the x-interval of segment that point dualizes to. When viewed in this dualized fashion the antipodal pairs, are pairs of segments, one from the upper envelope, one from the lower, with overlapping x ranges. Now, the upper and lower envelopes can be viewed as two different x-ordered lists of non overlapping intervals. If these two lists are merged, the antipodal pairs are the overlaps in the merged list. If a pair ab and c is an antipodal edge- vertex pair, then the x-interval for a and b must both intersect the x-interval for c. This means that the common endpoint of the x intervals for a and b must lie within the x-interval for c. The endpoints of both of the sets of x-intervals can be maintained in a kinetic sorted list. When points swap, the list of antipodal edge-point pairs are updated appropriately. The upper and lower envelopes can be maintained using the standard data structure for kinetic convex hull. The minimum distance between edge-point pairs can be maintained with a kinetic tournament. Thus, using kinetic convex hull to maintain the upper and lower envelopes, a kinetic sorted list on these intervals to maintain the antipodal edge-vertex pairs, and a kinetic tournament to maintain the pair of minimum distance apart, the diameter of a moving point set can be maintained. This data structure is responsive, compact and efficient. The data structure uses O(n) space because the kinetic convex hull, sorted list, and tournament data structures all use O(n) space. In all of the data structures, events, inserts, and deletes can be handled in O(\\\\log^2 n) time, so the data structure are responsive, requiring O(\\\\log^2 n) per event. The data structure is efficient because the total number of events is O(n^{2+\\\\epsilon}) for all \\\\epsilon>0 and the width of a point set can change \\\\Omega(n^2) times, even if the points are moving linearly. This data structure is not local because one point may be in many antipodal edge-vertex pairs, and thus appear many times in the kinetic tournament. The existence of a local kinetic data structure for width is open. ==Higher Dimensions== Efficiently maintaining the kinetic width of a point set in dimensions higher than 2 is an open problem. Efficient kinetic convex hull in dimensions higher than 2 is also an open problem. ==Related Problems== *Kinetic diameter *Kinetic minimum box == References Further reading== P. K. Agarwal, L. J.

He made his debut as a script writer for the blockbuster Kannada film Mungaru Male in 2006. He debuted as a director for the film Haage Summane in 2009. ==Personal life== Preetham is the grandson of the theater artist Gubbi Veeranna.http://www.chitraranga.com/en/news/activenews_view.asp?articleID=465 He is an associate of Yogaraj Bhat. ==CareerAs screenwriter=== Preetham made his debut with the film Mungaru Male. He wrote the script and co-wrote the screenplay with the director Yograj Bhat. The film had a simple story, that of the love and sacrifice of a young, carefree man. Preetam followed it up with two more simple tales - Geleya, directed by the long-time choreographer Harsha and the Ganesh starrer Aramane. Both did not attain the success of his first film. He has also written the story for his directorial debut, Haage Summane. ===As director=== Preetam was supposed to have directed the sequel to the hit Mungaaru Male. The film was supposed to have Ganesh and Ramya in the cast, however, both leads rejected the script that resulted in the shelving of the project. Preetam then picked up the script of Haage Summane for his debut, he cast relative newcomers as his lead pair - Kiran Srinivas and Suhasi. The technical team - the cinematographer Krishna, the editor Deepu S Kumar, music director Mano Murthy, lyricist Jayant Kaikini were all part of the original Mungaru Male team. The film released on 26 December 2008. It opened to a largely negative critical response, that Preetam had served Mungaaru Male again. However, Krishna's cinematography was largely praised and he won the Filmfare Award for the Best Cinematographer. Preetam went on to direct his second directorial Maleyali Jotheyali starring Ganesh in the lead in 2009. His next release was Johny Mera Naam Preethi Mera Kaam starring Duniya Vijay and Ramya in the lead roles. In 2012, Preetham had one release:Jaanu starring Yash and Deepa Sannidhi. His next script was based on bromance involving 3 youngsters and their love lives. Preetham cast an entire group of emerging actors including the child-artist turned Radio Jockey, Vinayak Joshi among others. He titled the film Nam Duniya Nam Style.

It consists of five iwi, NgƒÅti Kurƒ´, NgƒÅi Takoto, Te PƒÅt≈´, NgƒÅti Kahu, Te Aup≈çuri and Te Rarawa, with a combined population of about 34,000 people. The spiritually significant Hokianga Harbour, located just to the south of the Maungataniwha Range, is of special significance to the Muriwhenua people. The name Muriwhenua means \\"this is the end of the land\\", describing the rohe (traditional tribal lands) of the iwi, extending up the North Auckland Peninsula from the Maungataniwha Range to Cape Reinga. The name Te Hiku o te Ika translates as the tail of the fish, meaning the end of the North Island, which in MƒÅori mythology is the fish MƒÅui caught. Elders sometimes say the head of the fish is the New Zealand capital city of Wellington, but it can only go where the tail will allow. ==HistoryEarly history=== According to Muriwhenua tradition, the great waka navigator Kupe discovered the region, mistaking Houhora mountain, north of Kaitaia, for a whale. The crew of his waka explored from Cape Reinga to Parengarenga Harbour, including Karikari Peninsula, Tokerau Beach, Whangaroa Harbour and Matauri Bay. According to one tradition, he followed a current to Hakarara mountain in Matauri Bay. According to another, he landed in Hokianga Harbour, and on his return to Hawaiki, created waves which reached the coast of Ninety Mile Beach. The chief T≈´matahina is credited with helping the Muriwhenua people escape a besieged village as they were running out of food. He instructed his people to place dummy warriors, made out of bulrushes, around the pallisades of their pƒÅ (fortification), fix a long flax rope to a rock on the mainland, and use it to escape. T≈´matahina followed at the rear of the group, and used his large footprints to hide the footprints of the other people, concealing the escape from the enemy. The k≈´aka (bar-tailed godwit) is the symbol of the tribes; their annual migration from the Muriwhenua harbours represents the successful escape. Later, the Whangape chief Ueoneone travelled to Waikato, where he fell in love with the sisters Reit≈´ and Reipae and proposed to marry them. On her way north, Reipae fell in love with a chief named ≈åtƒÅhuhup≈çtiki and married him; their harbour became Te Whanga-a-Reipae (the harbour of Reipae) or Whangarei. Reit≈´ married Ueoneone at Whangape; their twin daughters Kauae and Tawakeiti married T≈´poto, a common ancestor of all Northland tribes. ===Colonisation=== In 1840, 61 chiefs from Muriwhenua signed the MƒÅori language version of the Treaty of Waitangi, in the hopes it would protect their lands from colonisation. However, the Muriwhenua people lost vast areas of land to settlers or the government. A report into Muriwhenua fisheries rights in 1988 led to the passing of the MƒÅori Fisheries Act in 1992. Since 1994, the tribes have settled land claims with the New Zealand Government through the Waitangi Tribunal. ==Notable people== * Hone Harawira, activist, politician and community leader * Hector Busby, navigator and waka builder * Tina Cross, entertainer * Whina Cooper, community leader * Mitch Evans, racing car driver * Anahera Herbert-Graves, MƒÅori leader * Ralph Hotere, artist * Margaret Mutu, academic * Shane Jones, politician * Stacey Jones, rugby league player * Anika Moa, recording artist * Mamari Stephens, lecturer * Meri Te Tai MangakƒÅhia, MƒÅori suffragist ==References== ","title":"Muriwhenua"},{"id":"35847303","text":"The Siege of Florence was a battle that occurred in either 405 or 406 CE, between the Goths and the Roman Empire at Florence. == Background == In 402 the Geougen, a nomadic Tartar people of northern Asia, who during the fourth century had gradually supplanted the Sienpi as the dominant people in the vast plains of Mongolia and Siberia, extended their conquests further by a victory over the Huns on the upper Volga, who had themselves formerly been the masters of the regions from which their victors issued.Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, (The Modern Library, 1932), chap. XXX., p. 1,066 Impelled westwards by this inroad of the east-Asian hordes, the Huns retreated further into Europe, and in turn drove from their homeland the Suevi, Vandals, and Burgundians, who had occupied central Europe from the Vistula to the Elbe.Gibbon, p. 1,067 Radagaisus, a bold warrior from the area of modern Mecklenburg, assumed command of a formidable portion of these tribes, who determined to unite for the invasion of the Roman Empire, in whose territory they hoped to find ample space for settlement, undisturbed by the constant attacks of the more savage Asian barbarians who were overrunning the areas of modern Poland and Germany.Gibbon, Ibid. In late 405 or early 406 CE, Radagaisus with his vast army, which he recruited with some of the wandering tribes of the Alani, as well as some of Alaric's Goths, who were disaffected with their recent defeat, broke over the undefended Danube frontier, and entered Rhaetia. Stilicho, master-general of the west, had recently stripped the further provinces, including those of the Rhine and Danube, of their regular garrisons in order to repel Alaric's first invasion of Italy.Gibbon, p. 1,057 Thus, Radagaisus was able to cross the Alps into Italy before meeting any resistance from Stilicho. == The battle == Radagaisus marched south into Italy, leaving behind him the destroyed farmlands and cities of the province, while Stilicho took up his quarters in Pavia, which he declared the rendezvous point for the Roman and auxiliary barbarian forces which he called from every direction for the defense of Italy.Gibbon, p. 1,069 In the meantime, the cowardly figurehead of the western empire, Honorius, took refuge in the fortified city of Ravenna, which had been designated the capital of the west (in place of the more exposed Milan) after Alaric's invasion in 401.Gibbon, pp. 1,068, 1,064-65 For unknown reasons, Radagisus halted on his march to Rome to besiege the large and prosperous city of Florence. The town was defended by a small garrison, but with conspicuous devotion and patriotism.Gibbon, p. 1,069 When the defenders of the city flagged in the face of the unremitting barbarian assault, their spirits were revived by the well-timed report of Bishop Ambrose of Milan's appearance in a nocturnal vision to a citizen of the city, in which he promised the intercession of providence for the succor of the inhabitants.Gibbon, Ibid., note 76 Not long afterwards, Stilicho arrived with his army and broke up the besieging barbarian army in the decisive battle of Faesulae (406).Gibbon, p. 1,070, 1,071 ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:400s conflicts Florence Florence 405 Category:Battles in Tuscany Category:History of Florence Category:405 Category:5th century in Italy ","title":"Siege of Florence (405)"},{"id":"35847305","text":"The Siege of Asti was a siege in 402 CE, laid by the Visigoths under their king Alaric I after the Visigothic invasion of Northern Italy.

His original intent of escaping to Arles was foiled by an advanced Gothic party which blocked his western march. Pursued by the invaders, the Emperor with his retinue fled instead to Asti, then named Hasta. The Goths placed Hasta under siege until March when General Stilicho, bringing reinforcements from the Rhine, forced them to lift the siege and retreat to a more convenient terrain in Pollentia, where they battled the Roman army. ==References== Category:402 Category:400s conflicts Asti Asti Category:Battles in Piedmont Category:5th century in Italy Category:Asti Category:400s in the Roman Empire ","title":"Siege of Asti (402)"},{"id":"35847306","text":"Fort Blackmore is an unincorporated community in Scott County, Virginia, United States.

His ancestral name was Ji (Âß¨), given name Yun (ÂÖÅ) or Gui (Ëªå), and Duke Huan was his posthumous title. ==Early life== Duke Huan was the son of Duke Hui of Lu and his main wife Zhong Zi (‰ª≤Â≠ê), daughter of Duke Wu of the State of Song. Duke Hui also had another son, Xigu (later Duke Yin of Lu), whose mother was a concubine. Although Xigu was the older son, Duke Huan was made the crown prince owing to the higher status of his mother. Chapter I. ==Accession to the throne== In 723 BC Duke Hui died after 46 years of reign. Although Duke Huan was the crown prince, he was then a little boy and his older half-brother Duke Yin ascended the throne with the understanding that he would rule as a regent until Duke Huan grew up. In 712 BC, Duke Yin's brother Prince Hui suggested that Duke Yin kill Duke Huan and permanently take the throne, but Duke Yin refused. Afraid that he would be killed if the word leaked out, Prince Hui went to Duke Huan and falsely accused Duke Yin of planning to kill him, offering to kill Duke Yin first. Duke Huan agreed. In the eleventh month of that year Prince Hui had Duke Yin assassinated when he was making sacrificial offerings, and Duke Huan ascended the throne as planned. ==Reign== In 709 BC, Duke Huan married Wen Jiang, daughter of Duke Xi of Qi, one of the most powerful states during the Spring and Autumn period. Three years later, Wen Jiang gave birth to a boy. The boy had the same birthday as his father, therefore he was given the name Tong, meaning \\"the same\\". Tong was made Crown Prince of Lu. In 696 BC, the State of Zheng was in turmoil. After trying unsuccessfully to kill the powerful minister Zhai Zhong, Duke Li of Zheng fled and Zhai installed Duke Li's half-brother Duke Zhao of Zheng on the throne. Duke Huan of Lu and Duke Zhuang of Song attacked Zheng in an attempt to restore Duke Li, but were defeated. ==Death and succession== In 698 BC Wen Jiang's father Duke Xi of Qi died and was succeeded by his son Duke Xiang of Qi. Before her marriage to Duke Huan of Lu, Wen Jiang and her older half- brother Duke Xiang had had an incestuous relationship. Chapter XII. In 694 BC, the eighteenth year of his reign, Duke Huan visited the State of Qi with his wife, and Duke Xiang and Wen Jiang renewed their sexual liaison. When Duke Huan found out about their relationship, Duke Xiang ordered his half brother Prince Pengsheng to murder Duke Huan when he was drunk. The people of Lu were incensed at Duke Xiang's crime, but could not do anything because Qi was a stronger state. To appease Lu, Duke Xiang had Pengsheng executed as a scapegoat. Crown Prince Tong, the son of Duke Huan and Wen Jiang, subsequently succeeded his father as ruler of Lu, to be known as Duke Zhuang of Lu. ==Other children== Besides Duke Zhuang, Duke Huan and Wen Jiang had two other sons named Shu Ya and Ji You. Duke Huan also had an older son named Qingfu with a concubine. Qingfu, Shu Ya, and Ji You were founders of three powerful clans that later controlled the power of Lu. Together they were called the Three Huan for all being descendants of Duke Huan. Ji You's lineage, called Jisun or Ji, eventually formed the splinter state of Fei. Duke Huan of Lu's son through Qingfu (ÊÖ∂Áà∂) was the ancestor of Mencius. He was descended from Duke Yang of the State of Lu È≠ØÁÖ¨ÂÖ¨ Duke Yang was the son of Bo Qin, who was the son of the Duke of Zhou of the Zhou dynasty royal family.

The folk Mordovian costume, especially female, is very colorful. It is subdivided into Erzya and Moksha types. Most fabrics for making clothes were homemade. Erzya and Moksha folk costumes had reached their complete artistic expressiveness by the middle of the 19th century The people, who worked on the land, could make fabrics themselves. They produced linen or stout canvas for hempen shirts, woolen cloth for warm clothes, brightly colored wool embroidery threads. They were painted using vegetable colorings. The most interesting is the women's clothing. It contains a lot of traditional features.

Mordvins-moksha, Tambov province, Temnikov uezd, end of XIX - beg.XX centuries. 06 Moksha National Costume is very colorful. The main part of women‚Äôs costume is a white canvas \\"Panar- shirt\\", which is decorated by hand embroidery. According to the cut, characteristic of embroidery, ornament, colour it is easy to identify the ethnic group a woman. The cut of Moksha ‚Äúpanar-shirt‚Äù differs from Erzya shirt. ‚ÄúPanar-shirt‚Äù is made from the bended in two linen. The sleeves are longer than those of Erzya shirt. The ‚ÄúPanar- shirt‚Äù has a deep low-neck. A traditional costume included like a kind of a dress put on over the blouse. There is a slit on the skirt in front. Such kind of cut in clothing was very popular among the people of the Volga region. == Decorations == Chest decorations included several circles of necklaces. Special circular collars had a hard base which was covered with canvas and embroidered with glass beads, buttons and chains. Also there were reticular breast-collars made of red glass-beads and copper buttons. They finally matched perfectly with a huge embroidery of ¬´panar¬ª and ¬´ruca¬ª. The Moksha women wore plenty of decorations on their hips. These decorations were made of shells, buttons and pendants. There were also special towels ¬´kes-kolucjat¬ª on hips. There could be 6 towels in one set. The footwear called ¬´karht\`¬ª was made of bast. The bast shoes were criss-cross braided, with low sides and special loops. The Moksha women wrapped their legs around with white or black pieces of material called onuchi. == Headwear == Women headwear varied greatly: head towels, headscarves etc. Moksha headwear consisted of 2 or 3 parts and hair dress looked like horns. Headwear showed the age and marital status. It was decorated with glass beads and lines of spangles, laces or gallons. There was a pattern on the front side which looked like ideogram. Ancient Mordovian embroidery beadwork with coins, buttons, medals and cowry shells usually decorated a festive folk dress. == Erzya National Costume == Erzya women in their national costumes The main element in the Mordvinian costume was a white canvas shirt, decorated with embroidery. Erzya shirt is made from two cloths, which beaned in two. In the middle, at the central suture there was a seam left to slit for the collar and the slit on the hem for a step. In the side seams on the top at right angle there were sewed sleeves. Traditional chest fastener in the Erzya costume was ¬´fibula syulgamo¬ª. It was an oval buckle made of thick wire with a movable pin which was used for chipping the collar. Rich lower part covered a deep chest slit. In the 19th century, the collar was usually fastened by two fibulas, one of which had no decoration. Complex belt elements played a particular importance in Mordovian women\`s costumes. Costume was loincloth- pulay, which was worn over a shirt. As a sign of pubescence, girls begin to wear a pulay since 13‚Äì14 years old and then it remained the woman\`s costume accessory until her death. Mordvinian woman could not appear in men society without a ¬´pulay¬ª. Depending on the place of existence, it had a different form: square, trapeziform or as a belt with magnificent fringe. Holiday ¬´ pulay¬ª was decorated with shells, chains, copper buttons, badges, colored beads and along the edge with long, black, red, green or blue wool and with tassels on each side. As a result, the weight of such a ¬´pulaya¬ª was up to 6 kilograms. Waist decoration ¬´pulay¬ª was of two types. The right side of the cloth was decorated with embroidery. Then, almost to knees there was a fringe from the wool, usually of black, but on holidays it could be of red or green wool. Wool decorated with copper chains and on each side attached tassels of beads. Typical thing for Erzya costume was a canvas over clothes- ‚Äúrutsya‚Äù. It was the clothing accessory of married women and had options for different situations in life and ritual. Over the shirt or rutsya they wore an apron ‚Äì ¬´ ikelga patsya¬ª. It was tied low on the abdomen to close the hem of her shirt. In the complex adornments, which included several tiers of necklaces, especially distinguished original round collars on a firm basis covered with a canvas embroidered with rows of beads, buttons and chains. All of them perfectly matched with massive embroidery ‚Äúrutsi‚Äù. The quality of clothing was defined by the type of embroidery. Spruce Erzya shirt was embroidered all along longitudinal stripes. Erzya embroidery was characterized by a beautiful carpet texture, borders and planes distinguished high relief. Although the ornament was pretty simple: rhombus, crosses and polylines. Decorating clothes women choose the best patterns ‚Äì ¬´sermat¬ª. In the old days they were the symbols of family belonging. Erzya woman naturally endowed with a sense of proportion. Intuitively, without the knowledge of designing and modeling clothes, she sewed a masterpiece. Red and black vertical stripes on a white canvas looked noble. A wide belt, ¬´pulay¬ª with long black strands emphasized hips and women looked slimmer. Removable adornments ‚Äìwere an obligatory addition to the clothes. This is a necklace with different lengths and materials, beaded collars, fibula-syulgamo, badges and bells. == Headdress == Like other nations, the Mordovians distinguished hats for girls and women. The girls most widespread type headdress was headband in the form of a hoop made of cardboard, covered with a cloth and decorated with embroidery, beads- pry syuks. Headband can be soft and decorated with paper flowers, bells and beads. Headdress- there were several types. They had cover the hair completely. Headdress was on a solid and square base- ‚Äò ¬´pango¬ª. The basis was covered with red material and decorated with embroidery, beads and chains. == Footwear == Traditional Mordovians footwear were bast shoes ‚Äìkart\` of lime or elm bast.

He was a member of the House of Wettin and was the younger brother of Elector Frederick III \\"the Wise\\" of Saxony (1486‚Äì1525). While his brother was destined to succeed his father, Ernest was destined for a religious career. As the appointment of family members as bishop was part of the Wettin's policy of expanding their influence, written negotiations about his appointment with the cathedral chapter in Magdeburg were initiated, even when the previous archbishop, John of Palatinate-Simmern, was still alive. == Postulation as Archbishop of Magdeburg == After the death of the archbishop of Magdeburg in 1475, intensive negotiations began on the postulation of Ernest. The proposal of the Wettin family, however, met with some resistance from the cathedral chapter, as Ernest was only 11 years old at this time. Nevertheless, the Wettin succeeded in January 1476 in obtaining the required two-thirds majority for Ernest's postulation. However, young Ernest satisfied none of the requirements for his appointment (minimum age of 30 years, ordination as priest, and a university education). It was, therefore, necessary to obtain a papal dispensation, which Pope Sixtus IV (1414‚Äì1484) provided in 1478, in exchange for a large sum of money. The dispensation confirmed Ernest's election and made him Prince-Archbishop of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, which consisted of non-contiguous areas surrounding Magdeburg, Halle and J√ºterbog. == Relationship with Halle == Halle was at the time in the grips of social and political conflict between the urban aristocrats and the owners of the salt factory on the one hand, and the guilds and the lower classes on the other hand. Ernest's advisors saw this as an opportunity to strengthen his influence in the city. Encouraged by Ernest's advisors, the guilds revolted against the aristocrats in 1478. They opened the city gate, allowing Ernest's army to occupy the city. Ernest's relatives and advisor's then used this opportunity to subject the city to the archbishop. This was made clear in decrees of 1479 and 1482, in which the rights of the city were curtailed. In 1479, the construction started of Moritzburg Castle. This castle was named after Saint Maurice, the patron saint of Halle. Its primary purpose was to control the subjected city of Halle. After 1503, it was also the preferred residence of the Archbishops of Magdeburg. == Relationship with Halberstadt == In 1479, the year Halle submitted to Ernest II, Gebhard of Hoym was urged by the archbishop to abdicate as Bishop of Hanberstadt. Elector Ernest of Saxony offered the cathedral chapter in Halberstadt a generous debt relief if they would elect his now 15-year-old son Ernest II as their new bishop, which they did after brief negotiations. However, simultaneously holding the bishoprics of Magdeburg and Halberstadt was an incompatible accumulation of benefices under canon law. Ernest therefore personally went to Rome in 1480, to obtain a new dispensation for his son. In the following years, a dispute between Ernest and the city council about the justice over Halberstadt escalated and in 1486, the city was besieged by the Archbishop's troops. After a four-week siege, the city had to capitulate and submit to Ernest's reign. == Relationship with Magdeburg == His relationship with Magdeburg was also characterized by tensions and conflicts. The source of the conflict was the city regarded itself as immediate, i.e. subject only to the Emperor, while Ernest held that the city was subject to him. This led to a conflict in 1482 when the city refused to pay its \\"Turkish tax\\" to Ernest and paid to the Emperor directly, as a sign of its immediacy. Both sides threatened military action, however, they agreed to have the conflict decided by the court of Emperor Frederick III (1415‚Äì1493). The court took its time to decide the case. After Ernest subjected Halberstadt militarily in 1486, the city of Magdeburg gave in and dropped its claim of imperial immediacy. == Expelling the Jews== A personal conflict between two Jews and two Franciscans escalated through pamphlets by one of the monks to attack the Jews in Magdeburg. During these attacks, a Jew was killed. The Magdeburg Council supported the attacks and prevented the bailiff from prosecuting the attackers. The city council aimed to unite to various groups in the city against the archbishop, who was formally the protector of the Jews. However, when the Jews turned to the archbishop for protection, he refused to choose sides. In 1493, he went further and expelled all 150‚Äì200 members of the Jewish community from his archdiocese. == Death and burial == From 1503, Ernest II showed symptoms suggesting an infection with syphilis. However, it is not clear whether he died of syphilis or some other infection. On 2 August 1513, foreseeing his death, he confessed his sins. He died the next day at Moritzburg Castle in Halle. At his request, his heart was buried in the chapel of Mary Magdalene in Moritzburg Castle. The rest of his body was taken to the Cathedral of Magdeburg. In 1477, he had restarted the construction of this cathedral, which had begun in 1363. In 1494, he had created a chapel for St. Mary in the cathedral and in 1495, he had added to this chapel a magnificent tomb made of cast bronze. On 10 August 1513, he was buried in this tomb. == References == * Helmut Asmus, Manfred Wille: 1200 Jahre Magdeburg: Von der Kaiserpfalz zur Landeshauptstadt, vol. 1: Die Jahre 805 bis 1631, Magdeburg, 2000 * Fritz Backhaus: Judenfeindschaft und Judenvertreibung im Mittelalter: Zur Ausweisung der Juden im Mittelelbraum im 15.

The term seems to have first appeared as a translation from the original Spanish Poesia Soc√≠al, used to describe the post-Spanish- civil-war poetry movement of the 1950s and 60s (including poets such as Blas de Otero ). Later, Jos√© Eduardo Lim√≥n, for example, has used it to describe Mexican-American Chicano poetry in Texas during the same period. Elsewhere, others have used the term to describe English-language poets such as W.H. Auden and George Bernard Shaw. Boston University has recently offered courses in ‚Äúthe social poetry of Central America.‚Äù == Development == More recently, John Stubley has made use of the term as part of the Centre for Social Poetry. Stubley expands the idea to include what Owen Barfield describes as poetic ‚Äúeffect‚Äù ‚Äì which distinguishes between the poetic form of words on a piece of paper, and the poetic effect of a ‚Äúfelt change of consciousness‚Äù. Stubley explores this poetic effect or experience as it occurs between human beings (socio-poetic experience), together with all that they can turn their minds and hands to in relation to the organisation (i.e., \\"poeticisation\\") of social life. He attempts to create spaces that give expression to imaginations of objective realities at work within the human and social organisms, thereby opening up the way to individual and social transformation. ==References== Category:Genres of poetry Category:Sociological terminology ","title":"Social poetry"},{"id":"35847552","text":"Level 9 was an English short-lived new wave band that existed from 1978 to 1980.

The episodes were built around a 90-minute episode that aired on the 21st and climaxed in a helicopter crash. Billed as Shortland Street's biggest ever episode, the anniversary was highly praised by reviewers and received record ratings. Other storylines included Gerald Tippett's heart surgery and Callum McKay's departure. Several characters returned to commemorate the occasion, with the Jeffries family; Yvonne (Alison Quigan), Maia (Anna Jullienne), Libby (Fleur Saville), Tania (Faye Smythe), Gerald (Harry McNaughton) and Jay (Liam Farmer), returning alongside the show's original receptionist ‚Äì Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae). Sophie McKay (Kimberley Crossman) also returned in a single scene, alongside several other minor character returnees. ==Casting== At least 10 past characters were confirmed to return for the anniversary, some in major roles whilst others in cameos. The return of several previous characters depended on the availability of the actors. Despite the line; \\"You're not in Guatemala now Dr. Ropata\\" being one of the show's most iconic moments, Temuera Morrison (Hone Ropata) was confirmed not to be returning for the special. Karl Burnett, who portrayed longest running original character - Nick Harrison confirmed he was not asked to return via his Facebook status. During an interview with Woman's Day in April 2012, Anna Jullienne confirmed her character Maia Jeffries would be returning to the show to meet with unannounced members of the Jeffries family. The following week it was confirmed that the other surviving members of the Jeffries family ‚Äì Yvonne, Libby, Tania and Jay would be returning alongside Libby's husband Gerald Tippett throughout May. Fleur Saville (Libby Jeffries) said returning to the show was; \\"like returning home! It was fantastic to see all my friends in the crew and cast and hear what everyone has been up to since I left 2 years ago.\\" Anna Jullienne (Maia Jeffries) was happy to return for the momentous occasion, stating; \\"It's been great to be part of the 20th celebrations. Shortland Street was a huge part of my life for years and I'm happy to celebrate its great achievements.\\" Producer ‚Äì Steven Zanoski described his decision to bring the Jeffries back as; \\"When we began to look at who could return for the birthday week we debated long and hard on who would work. But when we found out that the Jeffries family were available we instantly knew we had it.\\" On 7 May it was confirmed series original - Elizabeth McRae, would be returning as the character of Marj Brasch, the original receptionist. Zanoski explained Marj's return, stating; \\"With the return of Yvonne to the reception desk it was only a matter of course to have Marj back.\\" Paul Gittins (Michael McKenna) jokingly stated that he was not asked to reprise his role as his character had been dead for 13 years. The Emergency Department location was notably missing a doctor and so writers decided to introduce a character in the 20th anniversary episodes to fulfil this. This led to the creation of Josh Gallagher, who was described as; \\"an adrenalin junkie who loves the rush of ED and the precision and skill involved in surgical work. He's used to partying all night before sneaking in to start his shift\\" was created for this position Chris Tempest was cast in the role. The character of Lionel Skeggins was considered to be brought back, with Zanoski commenting; \\"There was talk of bringing back Lionel in a brief cameo appearance for the 20th Anniversary, just for all the fans who still believe that Lionel didn't die. I almost wish we had done it.\\" Several other less notable characters returned including Estevez Gillespie as Bailey Finch after an absence of 4 months, Henry Beasley as Tom Stanton after 4 months and Roy Ward as Nigel Tippett after 3 years. Kimberley Crossman also made a brief one scene reappearance as Sophie McKay as part of Callum's departing scenes. ==Production== In 2011 a special episode was announced of the show to air on the 20th anniversary. In March 2012 it was announced that the episode would be 90 minutes long and would likely focus on several returned characters. Producer - Steven Zanoski, was thrilled by the momentous episode saying; \\"It's been hugely exciting over the last couple of weeks as we see faces from the past come back through the studios, some for cameo appearances, others as pivotal parts of the storylines that are set to come.\\" Zanoski also announced that there would be an extreme stunt taking place in the episode, saying; \\"We are also gearing up to film one of the biggest stunt sequences we have ever done. We have all sorts of amazing hardware being delivered to our art sheds and everything is being kept top secret. Viewers will have a lot to look forward to over the next couple of months.\\" The episode's storyline was to feature a staff party where the doctors and nurses would don the original outfits worn in 1992. Actress Rachel Blampied (Bree Hamilton) was glad to be part of the 20th anniversary shoot, calling it \\"nostalgic\\". Her onscreen sister, Beth Allen (Brooke Freeman), agreed stating; \\"With everything going on with the birthday, it's a really exciting time to be part of the show.\\" The feature-length episode was also announced to take place on 21 May as part of the Winter season. Zanoski described the episodes as \\"spectacular\\". After numerous mentions of a helipad on the hospital roof as the anniversary drew near, it soon was soon announced that the episodes would climax in a helicopter crash. The helicopter wreckage was sourced from a helicopter that crashed in Auckland's Viaduct Harbour while erecting a Christmas tree in November 2011, with the sound effect of the crash coming from TVNZ, who had inadvertently caught the helicopter crash on camera. The scene took 11 hours to film. Numerous special effects were used and cast and crew speculated it would likely be the shows biggest stunt. The filming took night shoots and double shifts alongside stunt and technical work. Because of this Zanoski ensured the episode would be gripping and the show's \\"biggest ever episode\\". A storyline was devised where one of the show's primary characters would undergo a murder charge after killing off another character. Great deal of attention was put into how the character would be killed off and the concept of stabbing was decided upon. Medical researchers were also used heavily for the episodes, with crushing, drug addiction scars and heart surgery all being featured. ==Promotion== In April it was announced past Shortland Street actress, Kimberley Crossman (Sophie McKay) would be hosting an hour special titled; 'Naughty Shorty', that would show bloopers and mistakes from the show's first 20 years. Crossman enjoyed hosting the special, stating; \\"It's a great show and it was great to be able to host it and be in some of the bloopers as well. You can't really hide who you are when you make a mistake. You reveal so much of yourself and it'so so funny.\\" Crossman played the host, stating; \\"I basically play the role of that guy from America's Funniest Home Videos. All the hard work is done, and I get the pleasure of throwing to the hilarious moments.\\" and enjoyed the experience of returning to set; \\"It was cool to be back, see everyone and be part of something that people will be watching in years to come.\\" An official Shortland Street magazine was released to commemorate the occasion, the magazine featured interviews with cast alongside memorable storylines and characters from the soap's first 20 years. On 21 May 2012, a real-life situation occurred where a helicopter in Christchurch crashed into a lake. Although the soap was filmed months in advance, executives considered rescheduling the feature-length episode but it was decided against in favour of continuity. ==Reception== Of the week starting 17 May 2012, the Shortland Street 20th anniversary was named as one of the top five picks of the week. The episode received an audience of 756,980 people, thus screening to 50% of audiences aged 25‚Äì54.

Mi√©ville described the novel as \\"weird fiction\\", io9 labelled its mix of fantasy and steampunk elements as \\"salvagepunk\\" and the story has been seen as an \\"affectionate parody\\" of Herman Melville's classic 1851 novel Moby-Dick, also drawing on Robert Louis Stevenson's adventure novels Treasure Island and Kidnapped. ==Setting== Railsea is set on a dystopian world whose lands are covered by endless interconnecting tracks of rails, known as the \\"railsea\\". The earth is colonised by ravenous giant naked mole-rats and other carnivorous giant forms of familiar animals, such as earwigs and antlions as well as stranger non- identifiable creatures that reside in the polluted sky. These threats mean that humanity are confined to 'islands' of harder rock through which the animals cannot burrow and the spaces between can only be safely traversed by use of trains. ==Plot== Sham Yes ap Soorap is a young assistant doctor on a moletrain, captained by Abacat Naphi, that hunts giant moles for meat in a similar fashion to whaling. Naphi is especially obsessed with one mole named Mocker-Jack and after one encounter, they discover an abandoned train. Sham enters it, discovering a corpse and a camera buried in the ground. Sham and Naphi view the images and are shocked to see an image of a single rail leading off into the distance, an apparent impossibility as it is believed that the railsea is endless. As rumours spread of Sham's discovery, his investigations lead him to Caldera and Dero Shroake. They are the son and daughter of two explorers who ventured to the furthest reaches of the railsea before disappearing. Sham tells them of the content of the camera, and they resolve to retrace their parents steps aboard their own train. Sham returns to the moletrain. Before it departs, he is captured by pirates who demand that he provide them with instructions as to how to reach the Shroakes as they believe that there is treasure to be found beyond the railsea. After receiving a message from Sham, Naphi reluctantly abandons the chase for Mocker-Jack and sets out to find him. Sham convinces his former trainmates to assist the Shroakes, who are being sought by both pirates and the navy. They rescue them from their now almost incapacitated train and with a navy wartrain in close pursuit, venture out onto the lonely rail leaving the sea behind them. After a three way confrontation between the navy, Mocker-Jack and a robotic sentinel train that guards the exit of the railsea, the mole train escapes and Mocker- Jack falls into a chasm. The moletrain crew decide to return with their valuable salvage to the known world, whilst Sham and the Shroakes press on by foot to see what lies beyond. They are joined by Naphi, who is now directionless following the death of Mocker-Jack. They reach the end of the line and find the ancient descendants of the railway controllers, confirming an ancient rumour; that the seemingly endless complexity of the railsea is nothing more than the result of rampant rail development by unscrupulous developers in the distant past. After reaching an ocean they take a boat, left by the Shroakes' parents, and sail out into the unknown. ==Reception== Railsea was generally well received by critics. USA Todays reviewer appreciated Mi√©ville's mix of \\"emotional drama, Godzilla-esque monster carnage\\" and high adventure that would satisfy teenagers as well as Mi√©ville's adult fans. Stephanie Burt remarked on Mi√©ville's inventive language and world-building, and noted that the author's far-left politics are reflected in the slowly emerging history of Railseas derelict world, which amounts to a \\"funny, far- reaching indictment of modern capitalism\\". Several reviewers highlighted the metafictional nature of the novel. Writing for io9, Chris Hsiang noted that it abounds with \\"impish literary games\\", and praised its avoidance of either \\"dystopian romance tropes\\" or political sermonising in favour of a challenging, weird but still approachable language and structure. Others were more critical of Railseas metafictional approach. Jason Heller of the A.V. Club wrote that while Mi√©ville's swift and absorbing (if dense) prose and lean plot yielded a \\"brainy and thrilling\\" result, it would have been improved \\"if only he'd stopped less to comment on his own cleverness along the way\\". ==References * Category:2012 British novels Category:Novels by China Mi√©ville Category:British adventure novels Category:British post-apocalyptic novels Category:British children's novels Category:British steampunk novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:Del Rey books Category:2012 children's books Category:2012 science fiction novels Category:Works based on Moby-Dick ","title":"Railsea"},{"id":"35847625","text":"Kamakhya Prasad Singh Deo (born 6 August 1941), the scion of Dhenkanal, was a member of the 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th and 13th Lok Sabha of India.

Released in June 2011, and launched on 27 June at the Hideaway jazz club in Streatham, south London, it was the winner in the Jazz Album of the Year category at the 2012 Parliamentary Jazz Awards in May 2012. The album entered iTunes's jazz charts at no. 8 and reached the no. 1 spot in its first week of release. It received a four-starred review in The Guardian and a 4.5-starred review from All About Jazz. Recorded in London, Hastings, Brighton, Prague and Memphis, Tennessee, and produced by trumpeter James McMillan, the album features James McMillan, flugelhorn player Kenny Wheeler and saxophonists Kirk Whalum and Julian Siegel as guest soloists. ==Reception== Reviewing the album for The Observer, Dave Gelly said: \\"Liane Carroll... seems in some magical way to be made out of music. No recording has managed to capture this quality until now, but this one comes close\\". In a four-starred review for The Guardian, John Fordham said: \\"Singer/pianist Carroll is a world-class act, but this is the first recording to capture the full range of her expressiveness. Up and Down embraces intimate voice/piano performances, orchestra-backed extravaganzas and jazz jams with soloists of the pedigree of Kenny Wheeler and Julian Siegel.\\" He added: \\"Tom Waits's Take Me Home is a delicately soulful miniature, and the Christmas song Some Children See Him and the closing I Can Let Go Now are unadorned revelations... But the 82-year-old Kenny Wheeler's flawlessly poetic flugelhorn dialogue with Carroll on Turn Out the Stars might just be the most magical moment\\". Chris Parker, reviewing the album for LondonJazz, said that although Carroll was accompanied by a \\"starry assembly of musicians\\" on the album, \\"throughout, the focus is firmly on the Carroll voice and sensibility, inhabiting each song with all the honesty, integrity and sheer communicativeness that have won her, of late, the awards she so richly deserves\\". Rob Adams, for Scotland's Sunday Herald, said: \\"Carroll is absolutely on top of her game. Her creativity on a revitalised version of Bobby Timmons‚Äôs classic Moanin‚Äô and on the rollicking Witchcraft, with its cheeky reference to Georgie Fame's Yeh Yeh, borders on the volcanic. Now touching, now exhilarating, Up And Down is flat-out brilliant\\".

In the second cabinet in the same room are various portable electrostatic generators, each built according to a different design. On the bottom right in the back is the first model by Gerhard Kuyper that Van Marum had built in Groningen, with the mercury bath. The large electrostatic generator (Dutch: Van Marum electriseermachine) is a large handcrafted electromechanical instrument designed by Martin van Marum and built by John Cuthbertson in 1784 for the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, where it forms the centerpiece of the instrument room. The concept of an electrostatic generator was new, and the battery (array) of leiden jars was the largest ever built (only one of the 4 sets of leiden jars is on display to conserve space). The two glass disks of the generator are 1.65 meters in diameter, and the machine is capable of generating a potential of 330,000 volts. ==History== This 1794 demonstration of a smaller electrostatic generator in Felix Meritis shows the popularity of such devices, though Van Marum's machine was much larger. A copy of this engraving hangs in the Teylers Instrument room near the large electrostatic generator. The device is a larger version of a similar model built in Groningen by Gerhard Kuyper in 1774 for physics student Martin van Marum, who used it to make a name for himself in the study of electricity with his lectures and demonstrations.Verhandeling over het electrizeeren, Martinus van Marum, Gerhard Kuyper, Voor Rekening van Yntema en Tieboel, boekverkopers te Amsterdam, 1776 (translated into German in 1777 by Johann Wilhelm M√∂ller, Abhandlung √ºber das Elektrisiren) It was Van Marum's dream to create a larger version, and he applied to the Teylers Stichting in 1783 for funding to create such a large instrument in the hope that it would add a valuable contribution to the science of electricity. On April 11 of that year his request was granted, and on May 7 Cuthbertson was employed who finished the device a year later and it was proudly installed on Christmas Eve. The machine performed above expectations and was only modified a few times to prevent leaks of the static charge. The study of electricity leakage led to many insights in the study of electricity. The machine was last modified in 1791. For the friction, cushions were used as an improvement over the mercury bath used in the earlier model. For a complete description of the electrostatic generator, an explanation was produced in 1868 by the Parisian author Adolphe Ganot (1804-1887). Adolphe Ganot (translator: Edmund Atkinson) on the Wilhelm Holtz elektriseermachine, Elementary Treatise on Physics: Experimental and Applied, 4th ed. Wm. Wood and Co., 61 Walker Street, N.Y., N.Y., 1870, page 634, fig. 479 Van Marum himself became curator of the physics cabinet at Teylers in the same year the instrument was ordered to be made. He used it again and again in laboratory lectures to the public and continued to make excursions with his smaller model, which he finally sold to the museum for 120 guilders in 1790. ==References== * \\"Tot de vonken eraf vliegen : statische elektriciteit in beweging van Teyler toen tot TNO nu\\", G.A. van de Schootbrugge, TNO, 1985, Category:Teylers Museum Category:Electrical generators Category:Electrostatics Category:Historical scientific instruments ","title":"Large electrostatic generator (Teylers)"},{"id":"35847764","text":"Kunimi may refer to: * Kunimi, Fukushima, a town in Date District, Fukushima, Japan * Kunimi, Nagasaki, a town in Minamitakaki District, Nagasaki, Japan * Kunimi, ≈åita, a town in Higashikunisaki District, ≈åita, Japan * Kunimi (practice), the practice of climbing a mountain to survey the land * Mount Kunimi, a mountain on the border of Isehara, Hadano and Atsugi in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan * Mount Kunimi (Daik≈ç), a mountain on the border of Higashiyoshino, Nara, and Matsusaka, Mie, Japan ","title":"Kunimi"},{"id":"35847765","text":"Cheshire shown within England The county of Cheshire is divided into four unitary authorities: Cheshire West and Chester, Cheshire East, Warrington, and Halton.

The rationing officer at the station in 1930 was Frank Leeds, the station was in debt to the tune of 13,000 pounds at the time. The station is home to a rock formation known as the London Wall or China Wall which is about wide and long, the feature looks as though it is man-made but is a natural formation of granite tors that has been uplifted. The formation was first reported in 1938. The State government purchased Abydos and Woodstock stations in 1946. Both were set up to operate as research stations under the management of the CSIRO, Department of Agriculture and Institute of Agriculture of UWA.

The ancient temple is situated west of Tirunavaya railway station and south of Tirur railway station. It is one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage centres in northern Kerala. Kokila Sande≈õa of Uddanta Sanstrikal (15th century) mentions Triprangode among other major destinations in the region. Inscriptions of the Later Chera ruler Goda Ravi Varma (10th century) were discovered from the Triprangode Siva Temple. Later, the region formed a part of the Kingdom of Tanur (Vettathunad), who were the vassals of the Zamorins of Calicut. The main army led by the Zamorin camped at Triprangode during the Thirunavaya Wars of the 14th century. == History behind Triprangode Siva Temple == Long ago, there lived a sage called Mrikandu with his wife Marudvati. Both were devotees of Shiva (He is the Eternal Lord. He is the Ruler of time Mahakaleshvara the Originator of time (Mahakala) and Destroyer of time (Kalari) or Kalasamhara Murti). The couple were childless, and so decided to perform austerity rituals so they would be blessed with a child. Then one day, Shiva appeared before them, Shiva asked the couple if they desired an ordinary and mentally disabled son who would live a long life, or an exceptional son who would live a short life up until the age of sixteen. The couple chose the second kind. In due course, Marudvati gave birth to a boy and the child was named Markandeya. Markandeya was an exceptionally gifted child, and became an accomplished sage early in his childhood. He was especially devoted to Shiva, and had mastered the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra. As the boy was getting on to be sixteen,Rishi Mrikandu and his wife became sad. Noticing this markandeya enquired about their sadness and they replied that at the age of sixteen, his time on this earth will come to an end, and so Yama, came to take his life away. The boy, Markandeya then ran to Lord Mahavishnu (the preserver) but he was helpless and he directed him to Triprangottappan (Lord Shiva). On the way to Triprangode temple there was a huge banyan tree that stood by making difficulty to enter into the temple. At the time he reached there surprisingly the tree separated into two parts and then he could easily enter into temple. Markandeya hugged the Shiva Lingam and requested Lord Shiva to protect him from Yama. Yama threw his noose around the boy-sage; it encircled the Shiva Lingam too. At a blow, the Shiva Lingam burst open with a thundering roar and a majestic, fiery form of Lord Shiva appeared out of the blazing light. Lord Shiva was very angry and asked whether Yama has these much courage to encircle the Shiva Lingam with his noose, Shiva struck down Yama with his Trident (trishool), and Yama was no more. Markandeya was escaped from death. Shiva blessed Markandeya with eternal life and proclaimed that he shall remain forever as a sixteen-year-old sage. The assembly of Devas, who had witnessed all these, begged Shiva to revive Yama. Otherwise there will be a situation in the world with people live long without death. This would put unnecessary burden on the earth. Shiva then revived Yama, and declared that His devotees were forever to be spared from the noose of Yama. Since that day, the fiery form of Shiva that appeared to save the boy-sage Markandeya is called Kalasamhara Murti. == Temple == The temple is one of the most important temples in Kerala dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is situated on the side of fields known as 'Vellottu padam', facing west. spreads over a vast area of around 6 acres, with many sub-shrines, trees and ponds. There is a huge banyan tree in front of the temple. Another major tree in the temple complex is elanji tree, considered very important to Lord Shiva. We can also see bael (bilva/koovalam), the most important tree of Lord Shiva, inside the complex. The main idol is the swayambhoolingam of Lord Shiva, facing west. There is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Parvati towards the left side of Lord Shiva. There are four more shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva in the temple complex. One is considered as the 'moolasthanam', that means the original seat of the Lord. It is called 'Karanayil Temple'. The other three shrines represent the three steps taken by the Lord to kill Yama. Srikovil, Triprangode Siva Temple There are five ponds around the temple, among which three are in the temple complex itself. There is a pond in front of Karanayil Temple, which clearly approves the belief that it is the original seat. Very near to it, there are two more ponds, one named 'Santhikkulam', literally the place where the priests take bath before entering the temple, and the other named 'Vellottukulam', as it is near to Vellottu fields. The pond at the south-western corner of the temple is considered to be the place where the Lord washed his trident after killing Yama. There is a huge pond outside the temple complex in the north-eastern side. It is mainly used for public uses, for example : learning swimming, washing animals, etc. Devotees also take a bath here before entering the temple. An interesting feature of this temple is that there are three types of sreekovils (sanctum sanctorum), which are commonly found in Kerala. The main shrine is a two-storied one in 'Gajaprishta' shape, literally meaning the shape of the back of an elephant, and is very large in size. It has a southward extension, which encloses the shrine of Goddess Parvati, thus having the concept of 'Ardhanarishwara. There is a 'namaskara mandapam' in front of the sreekovil, used by the Brahmins for reciting Vedas, Shiva Sahasranama, etc. Here, we can find the idol of Nandi, the vehicle of the Lord. There is an idol of Lord Ganesha on the south-western door, facing east. Outside the main door, on the northern side, we can find the four sub-shrines of Lord Shiva mentioned earlier, and also a shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The original seat, Karanayil temple, is a two- storied square shrine. The shrine at which the Lord took his first step is round in shape, and the other two are square. The shrine of Lord Vishnu has an idol in his usual four-armed form, with Shankha, Sudarshana Chakra, Gada and Lotus on his arms. Behind Karanayil temple, there are shrines to Lord Vettakkorumakan and Goddess Bhadrakali. All are facing west. In the southern side, there is a shrine of Lord Ayyappa, facing west. Near to it, there is a stone statue of Lord Shiva as Mrityunjaya, that means the pose of killing Yama. The stone statue is the anthropomorphic depiction of the main deity. This idol was slightly damaged during Tipu Sultan's attacks. There are shrines dedicated to Lord Krishna, Snake deities and Brahmarakshas in the south- western side, all facing east. Lord Krishna is installed as 'Gosalakrishna', meaning the cowherd. Thus, his shrine is depicted as a cow shed here. The others have open shrines as usual. == References == * Triprangode Siva Temple * == External links == * Official website ml:‡¥§‡µÉ‡¥™‡µç‡¥∞‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡µã‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µç ‡¥∂‡¥ø‡¥µ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥Ç Category:Shiva temples in Kerala Category:Hindu temples in Malappuram district Category:Kuttippuram area Category:108 Shiva Temples ","title":"Triprangode Siva Temple"},{"id":"35847941","text":"Mattias Mete (born 30 May 1987) is a Swedish footballer who plays for S√∂dert√§lje FK as a forward. ==References* * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Syrianska FC players Category:V√§ster√•s SK Fotboll players Category:√Ötvidabergs FF players Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Superettan players Category:Swedish footballers Category:Dalkurd FF players Category:Husqvarna FF players Category:Syrianska IF Kerburan players Category:S√∂dert√§lje FK players ","title":"Mattias Mete"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const F=d(D,[["render",H]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/11.md","filePath":"quotesmag/11.md"}'),I={name:"quotesmag/11.md"},G=Object.assign(I,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{x as __pageData,G as default};
