Found on the Tennyson Lawn the tree was one of two original river red gums that were along the banks of the swampy billabong which makes up part of the Ornamental Lake. The tree was a Melbourne landmark and is best known as the site where the citizens of the city congregated on 15 November 1850 to celebrate when the news that Victoria was to separate from the colony of New South Wales after it had been announced by Governor La Trobe. It is one of the few trees left in the garden that pre-dates European colonization. The tree was approximately in height with a canopy that was around wide. The trunk had a circumference of at its girth. A plaque commemorating the centenary the separation of the colonies was placed at the base of the tree in 1951. Remains of the tree in 2018 In 1982 the Separation Tree was placed on the Significant Tree Register of the National Trust of Victoria. In 2010 and again in 2013 the 400 year old tree was damaged in acts of vandalism. In the 2010 attack the tree was ringbarked and about 90 per cent of the cambial tissue removed. The wound was further widened and the remaining 10 per cent was destroyed in the 2013 attack. The tree canopy and parts of the trunk were lopped in 2015 after it was confirmed to be dead. By July 2015 only the main trunk and parts of three scaffold limbs remained. There are 26 separate plantings of saplings of the original tree scattered around Victoria including one in the botanic gardens in Melbourne and another in the garden at Parliament House. ==See also== *List of individual trees ==References== Category:Individual eucalypts Category:Individual trees in Victoria (Australia) Category:Victorian Heritage Register Category:Heritage sites in Melbourne Category:2010s individual tree deaths ","title":"Separation Tree"},{"id":"56118790","text":"Stadyum is a light-rail station on the Konak Tram of the Tram ƒ∞zmir system in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey.

The railway was mostly constructed using cut and cover techniques under existing roads, though the section through Clerkenwell under Mount Pleasant hill was constructed using traditional tunnelling methods because of the depth of the tracks beneath the surface. Because of the depth, no station was constructed at Clerkenwell, leaving a greater distance between King's Cross (now King's Cross St. Pancras) and Farringdon stations than between others on the railway. In November 1910, the MR submitted a private bill to parliament that included plans to construct a new station at Mount Pleasant. The station would have been below ground. Parliamentary approval for the station was granted in the Metropolitan Railway Act 1911; however, the powers were not used and they lapsed in 1932. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:Unbuilt London Underground stations Category:Proposed London Underground stations ","title":"Clerkenwell tube station"},{"id":"56118871","text":"Alvi Ahmetaj (born 12 July 1998) is an Albanian footballer who plays as a Midfielder for Luft√´tari Gjirokast√´r. ==References== *ben merkato te Luftetari , Afron Ahmetajn *i Partizanit firmos kontrate 4 vjecare me Luftetarin *ahmetaj nga Luftetari == External links == * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Gjirokast√´r Category:Association football midfielders Category:Albanian footballers Category:Albania youth international footballers Category:KF Tirana players Category:Luft√´tari Gjirokast√´r players Category:Albanian Superliga players ","title":"Alvi Ahmetaj"},{"id":"56118873","text":"Jim Gerhardt (born March 2, 1929) is an American athlete.

The idea of using the motto of \\"take advantage\\" came from football: If a player suffers foulness and the ball is with him, there is no need to stop the match, and the game continues. \\"Gerson took great advantage of this 'law of advantage', and we wanted to insert it into the campaign, with the concept of more cigarettes at a lower cost,\\" recalls Lewkowicz - who did not think of such an overwhelming repercussion. ==See also== * Cigarette * Tobacco smoking ==References== Category:R.

She is most well known for her work with writing partner Myrna Culbreath, and for the fandom reference book Star Trek Lives! (1975), co-written with Jacqueline Lichtenberg, and television producer Joan Winston. She was an early promoter of Star Trek fan culture, and a publisher of fan fiction. Upon being introduced to Star Trek, she was struck by the \\"powerful relationship between Kirk and Spock and the focus on moral and philosophical issues.\\" Marshak is an avowed objectivist (a devotee of Ayn Rand), and she believes Star Trek advances objectivist ideals. == Early life == Marshak was born to Albert Hassan and Anna Tornheim in 1942. Little is known of her early life. In an interview for Voyages of Imagination (2006) by Jeff Ayers, Myrna Culbreath explained that Marshak had earned a master's degree in history, with \\"straight-A honors,\\" prior to their meeting, and that Marshak had planned to enter a doctoral program. She married LSU professor Alan Marshak, and had one son. == Fannish activity == Following her introduction to Star Trek, Marshak was explored to the series' fandom via a growing network of fan-published magazines. She began writing fiction based on the series, and submitted it to fanzines, where she met Jacqueline Lichtenberg. Marshak's first fan-published work was Spock's Decision, originally written by Lichtenberg in 1971. The new edition contained extensive rewrites by Marshak, and was anthologized in the fanzines Berengaria #2 () and Kraith Collected #4 (). Her other writings, also with Lichtenberg, were set in the Kraith alternate Star Trek universe. During the mid-to-late 70's, Marshak along with her writing partner Myrna Culbreath was a regular guest of honor at science fiction conventions, often joined by her mother, whom she addressed as \\"Mama.\\" == Career == Marshak's first professional publication was the reference work Star Trek Lives! (1975), co- written with Lichtenberg and Joan Winston. The ninth chapter, \\"Do-It-Yourself Star Trek,\\" discussed structure and themes in fan fiction and how they may reflect the cultural and sexual ideas of the fans who write them. The book, and in particular the book's final chapter, inspired Francesca Coppa to call Marshak and her fellow authors \\"the foremothers of 'fanfiction scholarship'\\" in The Fanfiction Reader (2017). Marshak co-wrote six Star Trek tie-in books with her writing partner, Myrna Culbreath, in addition to the William Shatner biography Shatner: Where No Man‚Ä¶ (). In Voyages of Imagination, both Culbreath and Marshak described their writing partnership as \\"virtually a Vulcan mind- meld.\\" She also contributed trivia to The Star Trek Puzzle Manual (1976) by Jeff Razzi. In the author's notes for The Fate of the Phoenix (1979), several projects were listed as forthcoming. In addition to follow-ups to The New Voyages series, Marshak and Culbreath announced a fictional travel guide, Mr. Spock's Guide to the Planet Vulcan, a new novel co-written by Nichelle Nichols, Uhura!, and a non-Star Trek science fantasy novel co-written by William Shatner, The Power. None of the books were realized, nor published if completed. Marshak has not published any new fiction since 1983, nor has she given any interviews since 2006. She was interviewed by the Orange County Business Journal in 2000 where she promoted Culbreath's PhonicsOpoly (1999) reading game. Jacqueline Lichtenberg wrote a comment on a blog written by literary critic Steve Donoghue in 2012 concerning Marshak's lack of an online presence. == Bibliography ==  Non-fiction  * Star Trek Lives!

In April 2010, he was vice-chairman of its Committee of Education, Science, Culture, Health and Sports. Gao is chairman of Hong Kong private investment company Sunbase International (Holdings) Ltd (), established in 1991. The business is active in property investment, transport, infrastructure and technology sectors. A subsidiary, Sunbase International Properties Management Limited, manages all 19 military sites held by the People‚Äôs Liberation Army in Hong Kong and provides services to the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua news agency. In June 2011, it was reported that Gao had made two visits to North Korea in 2010 and had secured rights to develop Hwanggumpyong Island as an industrial complex. The island is located at the estuary of the Yalu River, between China's and North Korea's border cities of Dandong and Sinuiju, respectively. He had met with Kim Yong- nam, president of the Presidium of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly, before a groundbreaking ceremony for the development. In August 2012, Gao announced that Sunbase would be investing RMB10 billion in oil refining, rubber and related industries in Anning City, Kunming, China. In March 2016, the District Court in Hong Kong revealed that Sunbase had failed to submit tax returns from 2003 to 2008 due to failure to compile financial statements and had been sued by the Inland Revenue Department. Gao is a member of the small- circle Election Committee which selects the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region government. In June 2016, it was reported that a total of eight organisations with votes on the committee had the same registered address as Sunbase, including the Association of Chinese Culture in Hong Kong of which he is chairman. Gao, as chairman of Hongkong New Henderson International Group, established a joint venture with Hubei Changjiang Publishing & Media Group (Holdings) Limited in June 2016 which was expected to embody \\"'six dry' spirit\\" put forward by Minister Liang Weinian of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department. On 21 November 2016, at a political fundraising auction held by the Chinese Communist Party's most- favoured political party in Hong Kong, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), Gao attracted media attention by paying HK$38.8 million for a four Chinese character work of calligraphy of dubious artistic value produced for the event by the CCP's top representative in Hong Kong at the time. In late November 2017, Gao, on behalf of a Sunbase- led consortium, proposed building Scandinavia's largest port, at the tiny community of Lysekil, Sweden. The secret offer, with a 10-day expiry, was accepted by the local town officials without public consultation or consideration at the national level, notwithstanding its economic, environmental and security significance. Under Swedish law, the power to approve such projects is entirely in the hands of the local municipal administration and cannot be challenged from above, so it was expected to proceed. ==References== Bauhinia Star, Silver Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Gao Jingde"},{"id":"56119061","text":"was a Japanese athlete.

He was the son of Howard Okie Sturges (1845‚Äì1920), a manufacturer of cotton, and Alice Spring Knight (1853‚Äì1930). He was an old- money New England socialite who trained as a violinist. After grade school and high school in Providence, he attended the Groton School in Massachusetts, then entered Yale University, where he graduated with an A.B. in the class of 1908. Before moving to Paris to study music he played the violin for the New Haven Symphony. He was an eccentric. He kept a pet bear and walked a pig on a leash through the streets of Paris. He was a volunteer in Paris during World War I. During the war he served first as a member of the American Relief Clearing House Headquarters in Paris, and later as secretary to Oscar Beatte in the American Red Cross. His services were rewarded by official recognition from the French government. Probably at a party of Elsie de Wolfe he met Linda Lee Thomas and through her, her husband, Cole Porter. Eventually he rented a suite of rooms at their Paris' house at 13 rue Monsieur. He was a close friend of Thomas's and went on to be Cole Porter's lifelong friend. Sturges lent Thomas a painting by Christian B√©rard, which hung for years in their Parisian drawing room. Sturges was gay and part of the crowd of gays and lesbians who used to travel around the world with the Porters, crowd including: No√´l Coward, Jack Wilson, Monty Woolley, Elsa Maxwell, Anne Morgan, Elsie de Wolfe and Elisabeth Marbury. In the 1920s Sturges was associated with Beatte in business in Paris. He was a member of the Agawam Hunt Club, and the Rhode Island Yale Alumni Association.

His main title was that of an Overseer of the treasuries. Sememiah is mainly known from his Theban tomb chapel (TT127) where there are remains of a longer biographical inscription. However, the inscription is not well preserved. Therefore it is problematic to reconstruct his career. Sememiah seems to have started in the temple of Amun and was scribe of the offering table and guardian of the offerings of Amun, as well as scribe of the counter of the cattle of Amun. It is unclear when he was appointed to an Overseer of the treasuries, but this was for sure under Hatshepsut who was once several times mentioned in the biography although here name was always erased. An important part of his career was certainly the expedition to Punt mentioned in the text, although it is not possible to gain any firm information from the destroyed text. It seems most likely that Sememiah died under Hatshepsut.

All 70 people on the two aircraft were killed in the crash. The primary cause of the accident was determined to be error by the air traffic controller; investigators never recovered the fuselage of the Yak-40. == Aircraft involved ==  Antonov An-24RV  Aeroflot Flight 7957 was an Antonov An-24 registered as CCCP-46518 with 47 passengers and 5 crew members aboard.

The air traffic controller in charge of the Western section of Krasnodar had been working for more than six hours by 13:30:44, the time the Yak-40 entered his sector of airspace while at an altitude of 5,700 meters. After receiving confirmation from the controller the Yak-40 continued the flight path and reported passing the Novodmitrievskaya non-directional beacon at 13:34 and remained at an altitude of 5,700 meters. After passing that point the flight was supposed to decrease altitude in accordance with the flight plan, but the controller was busy managing other flights so he let the flight continue on to the Gelenjik-Kerch part of the route at the 5,700-meter altitude. At 13:43 the Yak-40 reported passing Gelendzhik and stated its altitude to be 5,700 meters, to which the controller responding by granting it permission to proceed with the Anapa transverse but yet again forgot to instruct the aircraft to change altitude. The Antonov An-24 departed from Donetsk Airport at 12:56 for the flight to Sochi. At 13:32 the crew reported entering the Western section of Krasnodar on the Primorsko-Akhtarsk traverse at an altitude of 5,700 meters ‚Äì the same altitude as the Yak-40 in the same section of airspace. The controller responded by permitting the An-24 to proceed to Anapa and keep the current altitude, then gave permission for the aircraft to continue on to Dzhubga without changing altitude. At 13:51:05 Moscow time, the An-24 and Yak-40 collided in the air at an altitude of 5,700 meters, severing the tail sections of both aircraft. Both aircraft broke apart in mid-air and the wreckage fell into the Black Sea. All 70 people in the two aircraft were killed in the accident. The wreckage of the An-24 and the tail section of the Yak-40 were found in the Black Sea at a depth of . Most of the dead from the An-24 were recovered from the water but no bodies from the Yak-40 were found nor was the fuselage of the Yak-40 recovered. == Causes == The cause of the accident was determined mostly from radio and ground communications. The primary cause of the accident was described as a violation of the rules for maintaining separation between aircraft by the air traffic controller. Secondary causes of the accident were failure of both crews to remain sufficiently alert and a lack of appropriate situational analysis leading up to the accident. == References == Category:1976 in the Soviet Union Category:Aviation accidents and incidents caused by air traffic controller error Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1976 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the Soviet Union Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving mid-air collisions Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Antonov An-24 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Yakovlev Yak-40 Category:September 1976 events in Europe Category:History of Krasnodar Krai Anapa ","title":"1976 Anapa mid-air collision"},{"id":"56119152","text":"Manushullo Devudu ( God in Human) is a 1974 Telugu-language drama film, produced by A.

In Edinburgh she founded a temperance society for tailors and another for working women. ==Life== Fraser was born in Aberdeen in 1823. Her mother, Agnes, died when she was eleven and she took a strong interest in religion. Her father, Alexander, was the Lord Provost of Aberdeen. Fraser became interested in the education and well-being of tailors. In 1856 she first entered a tailor's workshop to educate them. She arranged for volunteers to read from the Bible as the tailors worked. The idea caught on and similar groups of lady readers were established in Belfast, London and Liverpool to read to tailors as they worked. Fraser thought that the tailors would improve their own working conditions if they were better informed and educated and in 1875 they formed the \\"Edinburgh Tailors' Abstinence Union\\".Kelly, S.

Retrieved 23 Dec. 2017, see link In 1876 she formed the \\"Scottish Ladies' Temperance Society\\". The society intended to open public houses where alcohol would not be served. They identified laundresses, cooks and similar jobs which made women prone to the temptation of drink. The society planned to make them total abstainers. Fraser moved to London in 1879 and the following year organised a conference on matters important to tailors. By 1885 monies had been raised to open an institute with a lecture hall and reading room. It was known as \\"Tailors' Hall\\". She became known as the tailors' \\"Florence Nightingale\\" or the \\"Tailor's Friend\\".

Founded in 2002 and staffed entirely by ophthalmologists, it aims to end blindness in Myanmar. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia and has the highest rate of blindness in the world. Working with partners and a network of providers, MECP operates clinics that provide routine eye care, acute treatment, and surgeries to Myanmar's poor rural populations. MECP also builds eye care infrastructure in rural communities, trains indigenous physicians and nursing staff, and provides equipment. ==History== In early 2002, a resident of Sydney, Australia, and former refugee from Myanmar asked Sydney-based ophthalmologist Dr Geoffrey Cohn OAM to consider setting up an eye care project in Myanmar. Cohn had previously worked pro bono in Bali, in the development of eye care projects in Indonesia in 1989 with Yayasan Kemanusiaan Indonesia (also known as The John Fawcett Foundation), in Papua New Guinea from 1993 to 2001 for the Church Medical Council of Papua New Guinea, and in Cambodia from 1998 to 1999 with HelpAge International. With the support of U Lakkhana, Chief Abbot of the Kyaswa Monastery, and with the help of local project co-coordinators, members of the monastery community and many volunteers, MECP began treating patients in The Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital by late 2002. A doctor examining patients on the morning following surgery Following this, a second project was established in a monastery hospital on the slopes of Mount Popa in 2003. The current national project co- ordinator and project developer of MECP for the past ten years, Daw Phyu Sinn Mon, initially trained as an ophthalmic technician at the Mount Popa-Taung- Kalat centre in 2003. At the request of U Nayaka, Chief Abbot of Phaung Daw Oo Monastery, another eye care project was started within his monastery at the foot of Mandalay Hills in 2004. In the following years, the service consulted with hundreds of thousands of outpatients, performed tens of thousands of free or low cost eye operations and trained many mid-level ophthalmic technicians (MLOT). The project has continued to grow with the help of donations and visiting teams of eye surgeons, technicians and support staff from Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Nepal, and the United States of America. The project has also been responsible for the introduction of subspecialty training of local ophthalmologists in vitreoretinal surgery, glaucoma and corneal specialties. In 2010, Sydney-based vitreoretinal surgeon Dr H. Kwon Kang introduced vitreoretinal surgery teaching and services to The Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital. In 2015, Prof. Gerard Sutton (Professor of Corneal and Refractive Surgery) and a team from the New South Wales Lions Eye Bank worked with Prof. Daw Yee Yee Aung (Professor of Ophthalmology, Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital) to establish the Mandalay Eye Bank. From 2014 to 2016, paediatric ophthalmologist and academic Dr Judith Newman has also assisted Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital in training paediatric ophthalmology. ==Ongoing projects== As of December 2017, the MECP has contributed to eleven projects, nine of which are currently running throughout Myanmar. Several outreach projects and charity programs are also being supported by MECP. The MECP aims to provide cataract operations either free of cost or at significantly reduced cost and also aims that all visiting ophthalmologists have some university- affiliated teaching experience. Eye service at the Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital This service was the original pilot project and continues to function as the principal teaching centre. It is one hour southwest of Mandalay. Mandalay Eye Bank Responsibility was handed to the MECP and Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital by former Minister for Health, Prof. Pe The Khin. The Eye Bank serves as a repository for donated corneas, which may be stored and transplanted into patients with severe corneal disease. The MECP has facilitated technical training (from Sydney Eye Bank Technician Raj Devashayam) to harvest, assess and store corneas as well as surgical training (from Prof. Gerard Sutton) to perform and optimize corneal transplantation. Phaung Daw Oo Monastery, Mandalay Commencing in 2003, the MECP has provided equipment for the Eye service, trained many ophthalmic technicians and has recruited two Mandalay surgeons to serve this centre. The centre has become largely self-sufficient with MECP input needed only for equipment maintenance and replacement. Yangon Jivitadana Sangha Hospital The centre dates initiatives back to the 1940s; however, the eye service commenced in 2012. The MECP has provided equipment and support, which allows more than twenty Yangon eye surgeons to operate in their spare time. MECP sponsors approximately 3,000 free cataract operations per year. North Okkalapa General Hospital The MECP has significantly contributed to the surgical resident teaching program at the North Okkalapa General Hospital. This includes funding for teaching, teaching accessories, operating microscopes, lasers and other equipment. The centre now performs up to 2,400 free or subsidised cataract operations per year and provides training for ophthalmologists in residency. Thiri Dagon Monastery Located in Northeast Yangon in a highly flood-prone area, the MECP provides ophthalmic technicians and has facilitated two volunteer surgeons to service the area. The centre performs 1,500 free or subsidised cataract operations per year. Phyar Pone In the wake of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the MECP initially established two eye services, which merged into one to serve the people of the Ayeyarwady Region. The service employs ophthalmic technicians and ophthalmologists to perform 1,200 cataract operations per year. Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital The MECP facilitated the donation of 1000 cataract operations in 2013, as well as the donation of specialist equipment. The MECP also provides ongoing support and teaching as required. Hmawbi Monastery Requested by U Say Keinda, Chief Abbot of Hmawbi Monastery, the MECP established the service and has employed ophthalmic technicians, provided equipment and arranged for visiting ophthalmologists to service the area. The centre is now independent of MECP. Htee Saung Eye Hospital Serving as the principle training and development centre for ophthalmic technicians for the MECP, the hospital is the largest service under the governance of the MECP. This service employs up to four eye surgeons from Nepal and Laos and frequently accommodates teams of visiting eye surgeons from New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, China and the United States. In 2017, this service is expected to perform over 27,000 free cataract operations. Pyin Cee Monastery Eye Hospital Created in 2015, the MECP has provided equipment for the centre, trained ophthalmic technicians and has currently recruited one surgeon to serve this centre. The centre performs approximately 2,000 cataract operations per year. ==Related organisations== * Cambodia Eye Care Project * Andhra Pradesh Eye Care Project == References == Category:Medical and health organisations based in Myanmar Category:Ophthalmology organizations ","title":"Myanmar Eye Care Project"},{"id":"56119431","text":"Tapio Lehto (8 December 1930 - 5 February 2019) was a Finnish athlete.

The independence of a condition is shown by changing the condition value in isolation. Each relevant condition value is covered by test cases. ==A test case== A test case consists of a logical path from start to end of a process, through one or many decisions. Contradictory situations are deduced from the test case matrix and excluded. The MC/DC approach isolates every condition, neglecting all possible subpath combinations and path coverage. :T=n+1 where * T is the amount of test cases per decision, and * n the amount of conditions.

Conditions are represented by nodes and condition values (situations) by edges. All program situations are addressed by an edge. Each situation is connected to one preceding and successive condition. Test cases might overlap due to isolated conditions. ==Inductive proof of number of condition paths== The elementary comparison testing method can be used to determine the number of condition paths by inductive proof. Figure 2: ECT Inductive Proof Anchor There are r=2^n possible condition value combinations \\\\forall{i}\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,...,n\\\\\\\\}\\\\ c_i\\\\mapsto\\\\\\\\{0,\\\\ 1\\\\\\\\}. When each condition c_i is isolated, the number of required test cases T per decision is: T=\\\\log_2(r)+1 = n + 1.

All predecessor conditions c_i;\\\\ i and respective paths are isolated. Therefore, when one node (condition) is added, the total number of paths, and required test cases, from start to finish increases by: \\\\begin{align}T&=n-1+2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=n+1.\\\\end{align} \\\\ q.\\\\ e.\\\\ d. ==Test-case design steps== # Identify decisions # Determine test situations per decision point (Modified Condition / Decision Coverage) # Create logical test-case matrix # Create physical test-case matrix ==Example== Figure 4: ECT Example Control Flow Graph Figure 5: ECT Example D2 Conditions This example shows ETC applied to a holiday booking system.

He was born in a Brahman family and studied Sanskrit from his maternal uncle Ganapati Aapayo. Later, he went to Telangana for further studies. After returning to Maharashtra, he won debates against many scholars of Indian philosophy. He first met Chakradhar Swami on the insistence of his uncle, when he debated him at Domegram, and returned home influenced by him. Arriving at a decision to follow Chakradhar Swami, he went to Riddhapur where Govind Prabhu, guru of Chakradhar Swami, resided. Mhaimbhat was married to Deaamba, daughter of his uncle Ganapati Aapayo. ==Literary works== Mhaimbhat took upon himself the task of writing a memoir of Chakradhar Swami soon after the latter died. He traveled all over Maharashtra and collected anecdotes and life events related to Chakradhar Swami. With the help of Bhatobas, another disciple of the sect, he met a large number of people connected to Chakradhar Swami and collected material from various sources ‚Äì often cross-checking the same story from more than one source to evaluate trustworthiness. This approach by Mhaimbhat is considered rather scientific, considering he was writing in 13th-century India. Later in his life, Mhaimbhat also wrote Riddhapur Charitra, a biography of Govind Prabhu, another figurehead of the Mahanubhava sect. Along with these two biographies, he wrote ten aartis lyrical hyms in praise of God ‚Äì which form a part of Mahanubhava rituals. ==Legacy== As an author of Leela Charitra, Mhaimbhat is considered to be the first known prose writer in the Marathi language.

Accessed Aug 24, 2020.) is an ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, mainly fought between Islamist militants attempting to establish an Islamic state in the region, and Mozambican security forces. Civilians have been the main targets of attacks by Islamist militants. The main insurgent faction is Ansar al-Sunna, a native extremist faction with tenuous international connections. From mid-2018, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has allegedly become active in northern Mozambique as well, and claimed its first attack against Mozambican security forces in June 2019. In addition, bandits have exploited the rebellion to carry out raids. The insurgency is thought to be intensifying, as in the first half of 2020 there were nearly as many attacks carried out as in the whole of 2019. Ansar al-Sunna (English: Supporters of the tradition) is similar to the name of an Iraqi Sunni insurgent group that fought against US troops between 2003 and 2007. Locals call them \\"al-Shabaab\\" but they are a separate organization from Somali al-Shabaab. The militants are known to speak Portuguese, the official language of Mozambique, Kimwane, the local language, and Swahili, the lingua franca language spoken in the Great Lakes region. Reports also state that members are mostly Mozambicans from Mocimboa da Praia, Palma and Macomia districts, but also include foreign nationals from Tanzania and Somalia. ==Background== Ansar al-Sunna, also known by its original name \\"Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jamo\\" (translated \\"adepts of the prophetic tradition\\"), was initially a religious movement in northern districts of Cabo Delgado which first appeared around 2015. It was formed by followers of the radical Kenyan cleric Aboud Rogo, who was killed in 2012. Thereafter, some members of his movement settled down in Kibiti, Tanzania, before moving into Mozambique. Ansar al-Sunna claims that Islam as practised in Mozambique has been corrupted and no longer follows the teachings of Muhammad. The movement's members consequently entered traditional mosques with weapons in order to threaten others to follow their own radical beliefs. The movement is also anti- Christian and anti-Western, and has tried to prevent people from attending hospitals or schools which it considers secular and anti-Islamic. This behavior alienated much of the local population instead of converting them to Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jamo, so that the movement's members broke away and formed their own places of worship. Over time, the group became increasingly violent: It called for Sharia law to be implemented in the country, no longer recognized the Mozambican government, and started to form hidden camps in Macomia District, Moc√≠mboa da Praia District, and Montepuez District. There, Ansar al-Sunna militants were trained by ex-policemen, and ex-frontier guards who had been fired and held grudges against the government. The movement also contacted other Islamist militants in East Africa, and reportedly hired al- Shabaab trainers from Somalia, Tanzania, and Kenya. These al-Shabaab trainers acted as mercenaries, however, and aided Ansar al-Sunna not out of actual connections between al-Shabaab and Ansar al-Sunna, but due to the pay they received from the latter. Some of the Ansar al-Sunna militants have also journeyed abroad to receive direct training by other militant groups. The militants are not unified, but split into different cells which do not appear to coordinate their actions. By August 2018, the Mozambican police had identified six men as leaders of the militants in Cabo Delgado: Abdul Faizal, Abdul Raim, Abdul Remane, Ibn Omar, \\"Salimo\\", and Nuno Remane. Ansar al-Sunna funds itself through heroin, contraband and ivory trade. While religion does play a fundamental role in the conflict, analysts believe the most important factors in the insurgency are widespread social, economic and political problems in Mozambique. Unemployment and especially youth unemployment are considered the main causes for locals to join the Islamist rebels. Increasing inequalities have led many young people to be easily attracted by such a radical movement, as Ansar al-Sunna promises that its form of Islam will act as \\"antidote\\" to the existing \\"corrupt, elitist rule\\". ==Timeline== 2017 * On 5 October, a pre-dawn raid targeted 3 police stations in the town of Moc√≠mboa da Praia. It was led by 30 armed members, who killed 17 people, including two police officers and a community leader. 14 of the perpetrators were captured. During this brief occupation of Moc√≠mboa da Praia, the perpetrators stole firearms and ammunition and told residents that they reject state health and education, and refused to pay taxes.

The Foreign Investment Protection Agreement (FIPA) or Foreign Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement (FIPPA) are Canadian names for BITs. ==Nomenclature== The DFAIT name of the Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments DFAIT name of the agreement is the Canada-China Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Agreement. McCarthy T√©trault referred to the agreement as the China-Canada BIT. In Canada the name for Bilateral Investment Treaties is Foreign Investment Protection Agreement (FIPA) or Foreign Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement (FIPA).According to McCarthy T√©trault, Canada entered into Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection agreements with Argentina on 29 April 1993, Ecuador on 6 June 1997, Venezuela on 28 January 1998, Uruguay on 2 June 1999, and Peru on 20 June 2007. Corporations, that engage in bilateral trade, can use FIPAs to protect against public policies that interfere with their operation's revenue.Chapter 11 in North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) represented Canada's first FIPA. according to the Council of Canadians. The Council of Canadians referred to the agreement as the Canada-China FIPA. Hupacasath First Nation and other First Nations organizations referred to it the Canada China FIPPA. == Notable obligations and clauses == The Canada China FIPA ties Canada \\"to the terms of the agreement for a minimum of 31 years.\\" The three core Canada China FIPA substantive obligations include \\"non-discriminatory treatment\\", \\"fair and equitable treatment\\", and \\"compensation for expropriation\\". According to a 2012 Foreign Investment Law Journal article, Canada's 2012 FIPPA model, links \\"fair and equitable treatment\\" to \\"The Minimum Standard of Treatment\\" customary international law. This ensures \\"fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in accordance with the principles of customary international law.\\" Concerns were raised regarding the provision for national treatment in Article 6 because the CCPRPIA did not provide for pre- establishment national treatment (a right of entry into the Canadian or Chinese markets for investors of the other country). This could disproportionately favour Chinese investors in Canada because China places more onerous requirements on foreign investors for the registration and approval of new enterprises than does Canada, and because government screening in China involves numerous levels of bureaucracy for new companies.  Investor-State Dispute Settlement  Article 15 provides that investors of one country are permitted to sue the government of the other county through an international tribunal. Corporations from either country can sue if the country in which they have their operations has public policies even those intended on protecting the environment, health, or safety that the corporation says \\"interferes with the corporation‚Äôs profitability\\". Canada's risk of such lawsuits is much greater than China's, since \\"China's foreign direct investment in Canada is much higher than Canada's in China.\\" By 2015, Chinese foreign direct investment in Canada in 2015 was roughly three times the amount of Canadian investment in China. According to a 2014 article published by Osler, the Agreement provides safeguards to Canadian investors in the Chinese economy. The article also said that the agreement was one of China's first investment treaties with such comprehensive dispute settlement provisions.As per Article 22 of the CCPRPIA, investors may submit claims either to UNCITRAL or to ICSID.The CCPRPIA is the first of China's investment treaties to provide for full post-establishment National Treatment (subject to any regulations and practices which were already in place, as per Article 8.2(a)(i)).China's investment agreement with Seychelles included full post-establishment national treatment prior to the CCPRPIA, but it has not yet entered into force. ==Background== Canada began negotiating with China on a FIPA in 1994.The first Team Canada trade visit to China‚Äîwhich consisted of about \\"nearly 500 political and business executives\\"‚Äîtook place in November 1994, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien. The Harper government held out on finalizing the text and ratifying the agreement due to diplomatic differences and concerns about Chinese human rights abuses. The China Canada FIPA was signed in 2012. In 2013, On January 18, 2013, the Hupacasath First Nation of British Columbia filed a court application to stop the Harper administration from ratifying the Canada China FIPA until consultations with First Nations on potential impacts of the FIPA took place. First Nations were concerned about the FIPA's Investor State Arbitration (ISA) clause. While Canadian trade officials said in 2014 that FIPA was \\"unremarkable\\" and that it was a continuation of \\"Canada's past foreign investment promotion and protection practice, a 2014 Canadian Yearbook of International Law article described, FIPPA as \\"novel\\" as it was \\"non-reciprocal in favour of China\\". The Yearbook article said that FIPPA provides a \\"general right of market access by Chinese investors to Canada but not by Canadian investors to China.\\" China was given a \\"wider scope for investment screening\\" than Canada. The agreement did not include a \\"long-standing Canadian reservation for performance requirements that favour Aboriginal peoples\\". It diluted \\"Canada's established position on transparency in investor-state arbitration\\". These and other textual aspects of the China FIPPA are highlighted in comparison to other trade and investment treaties, especially those to which Canada is a party, that provide for investor state arbitration. Elizabeth May said that the FIPA posed a threat to Canadian sovereignty. May described the negotiations as \\"secretive\\". The terms of the agreement were not released until after the Harper government fell. Critics said that some of the terms were considered unfavourable to Canadian investors and citizens. The Canada China FIPA has been in force since October 1, 2014. By 2017, the Canada China FIPA remained unfamiliar to most Canadians, even investors, according to the Canada China Business Council Rotman Institute for International Business. The Rotman Institute said that the agreement provided considerable certainty for those investors who are familiar with it. The CCPRPIA was mentioned by Elizabeth May in the second French leadership debate of the 2019 Canadian federal election on 10 October. ==Notes References == Category:International trade of Canada Category:Treaties of Canada ","title":"Canada-China Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Agreement"},{"id":"56119866","text":"Andrew H.

Together with the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence and Permanent Structured Cooperation it forms a new comprehensive defence package for the EU.Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) - Factsheet, European External Action Service ==Eligible projects== Development of equipment and technology Through two precursors to the Fund, the Commission took further steps to make defense cooperation a reality. In 2019 the Commission kick- started the first EU-funded joint defense related industrial projects through the European Defense Industrial Development Program. The first program agreed with the Member States provided ‚Ç¨500 million in co-financing for the joint development of defense capabilities during 2019-2020. These cover priority areas in all domains such as air, land, sea, cyber and space:European Commission: European Defence Fund * Protection and mobility of forces: to help develop CBRN threat detections capabilities or counter drone systems. * Intelligence, secured communication & Cyber: situational awareness and defence, space situational awareness and early warning capabilities, or maritime surveillance capabilities. * Operations: to upgrade or development of the next generation of ground-based precision strike capabilities, ground combat capabilities, air combat capabilities and future naval systems. * Innovation & SMEs: to support solutions in Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Cyber technologies, as well as to support SMEs. * Eurodrone: for a crucial capability for Europe's strategic autonomy. * ESSOR to support interoperable and secure military communications. Research The 2019 Work Programme also dedicated ‚Ç¨25 million for research in Electromagnetic Full- spectrum dominance and Future Disruptive Defence Technologies. These two areas have been identified as essential to maintain Europe's long-term lead and independence. The calls on Future Disruptive Defence Technologies will look at how best the EU can support disruptive technologies in defence that may lead to transformational changes in the military. This will help prepare the ground for the European Defence Fund which could allocate up to 8% of its budget for disruptive technologies.European Commission: European Defence Fund In June 2018, the Commission proposed to allocate ‚Ç¨13 billion to the fund for the period 2021-2027. The aim is to support collaborative defence projects throughout the entire cycle of Research and development.Forbes: Green Light For The EU Defence Fund: More European Cooperation In A Context Of Global Instabilities The Council of the European Union and the European Parliament are to adopt the proposal by 2019.European Commission: European Defence FundEURACTIV: EU lawmakers rubber-stamp European Defence Fund, give up parliamentary veto ==See also== *Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation *European Defence Agency *European Research Council *Western European Armaments Group *Western European Armaments Organisation *NATO Support and Procurement Agency *NATO Standardization Office ==ReferencesExternal links== * European Defence Fund - factsheet * EDIDP and PADR - factsheet * More information on PADR Work Programme * More information on EDIDP Work Programme * The European Defence Fund: Questions and Answers, European Commission Category:Military equipment of the European Union Category:Military economics Category:Innovation economics es:Fondo europeo de defensa ","title":"European Defence Fund"},{"id":"56119919","text":"The United Australia Party (UAP) held a leadership election on 22 September 1943, following the resignation of Billy Hughes. Robert Menzies, the party's former leader from 1939 to 1941, was elected as his replacement, defeating three other candidates ‚Äì Thomas White, Allan McDonald, and Percy Spender. ==Background== Hughes had been elected party leader in 1941, following the defeat of the Coalition government led by Arthur Fadden, the leader of the Country Party. The UAP simultaneously voted to form a \\"joint opposition\\" with the Country Party, under Fadden as Leader of the Opposition. Hughes, who had his 80th birthday in 1942, was viewed as a figurehead more than anything else, and the party virtually ceased to exist as a separate entity under his leadership; at one point there were no partyroom meetings for more than a year. At a meeting on 25 March 1943, a spill motion was put forward and defeated 24‚Äì15; it had been expected that the vote would be much closer.UAP LEADER, The West Australian, 27 March 1943. The following month, Menzies and his supporters formed a ginger group within the UAP, known as the National Service Group, to push for \\"new and vigorous leadership\\". They would remain in the party, but no longer attend its meetings, only those of the joint opposition. Hughes denounced them as \\"a reactionary clique\\". ==Election and aftermath== A federal election took place on 21 August 1943, at which the Coalition was defeated in a landslide. Hughes announced his resignation on 22 September, and four candidates stood as his replacement ‚Äì Menzies, Thomas White, Allan McDonald, and Percy Spender. Spender was eliminated on the first ballot, where Menzies reportedly failed to secure a majority by only a single vote. He won an absolute majority on the second ballot. The exact figures were not announced, but it was reported that Menzies obtained 14 votes out of 26 on the second ballot and that White and McDonald shared the remainder \\"nearly equally\\".MENZIES TO LEAD OPPOSITION, The Courier-Mail, 23 September 1943. An election was also held for the deputy leadership, which had been vacant since 1939. White, McDonald, Spender, Harold Holt, and William Hutchinson all nominated, but withdrew when Hughes announced he wished to be a candidate, allowing him to be returned unanimously. At the same meeting, the UAP voted to end the joint opposition arrangement with the Country Party. As a result, Menzies replaced Fadden as Leader of the Opposition.MR.

Farr (November 29, 1861 ‚Äì May 18, 1909) was an American businessman and politician from Holyoke, Massachusetts. Born in Chesterfield, New Hampshire on November 29, 1861, to Lark L. and Mary (n√©e Young) Farr, he attended school at Newark, Bellow's Falls, and Westminster, Vermont, and Swanzey, New Hampshire. In 1879 he moved to Holyoke, entering the employ of the Farr Alpaca Company, a local mill founded by a cousin, first as a millworker and later in its offices as paymaster and subsequently assistant treasurer, managing the salaries of the mill's more than 1000 employees. On October 12, 1886 he married Augusta Shaefer of Windsor Locks, Connecticut; the couple had three children, one son and two daughters. Farr took an active interest in public affairs; an active member of the local Republican Party, he was elected to the city council from ward 5 in 1887, and subsequently as an alderman of ward 6 in 1888. From 1890 to 1893 he served as treasurer to the city, and at the end of this term was elected mayor of Holyoke, serving in the latter for a single year term. The previous administration of Jeremiah Sullivan had received recommendation from a physician that new sewers were crucial to public health. While the previous administration determined requirements for the project, it was Farr's which worked with the Committee of Sewers and Drains to raise funds through bonds, and ultimately appropriate more than $300,000 dollars for construction ($8.1 million 2016 US Dollars).Westegg Inflation Calculator Workers standing next to large-diameter pipe during construction of new sewers, Bids were put out for more than 50,000 linear feet of piping and in all more than $229,000 was expended on the project in that year. During this time Farr presided over the construction of sewers for the neighborhoods of Elmwood, Oakdale, and Springdale, as well as two new school buildings. This work was especially important in that time, as only 20 years earlier in 1872, the city had the 2nd highest mortality rate in the Commonwealth and state health inspectors described many areas covered with \\"filth and green slime, [while] within twenty feet [tenants] lived in basements\\". In his closing report to the City, Farr released a \\"statement of work\\" for the year which was described by a reporter for Springfield Republican as a \\"novel feature\\" that \\"had not been done before\\". In the span of that year Farr reported that all construction of the necessary permanent improvements was performed without any overdraft from the treasury or suspension of funds. Farr himself later served as an auditor to the treasurer's office in 1896, and was also a member of the finance board of the local YMCA. Ever involved in public life, Farr was also described as an active member of the Mount Tom Lodge A.F. & A.M., the Holyoke Turner Hall, and the Holyoke Canoe Club. Following a period of ill health Farr resigned from his positions in the Farr woolen mill in 1902. From 1906 until his death he remained connected with his family's business as manager of its bonded warehouse connected with the plant. Having been of ill health for several years, Farr died on May 18, 1909, in Holyoke at the age of 47 and was interred in Forestdale Cemetery. ==References== Category:1861 births Category:1909 deaths Category:Mayors of Holyoke, Massachusetts Category:People from Chesterfield, New Hampshire Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:American Freemasons ","title":"Dennie L.

Foy (born January 28, 1956) is an American politician and professor who served as Mayor of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from 2001 to 2009. He is a member of the Democratic Party. As mayor, Foy focused on land-use ordinances and urban planning in the town. He now teaches at North Carolina Central University School of Law. ==Education and early work== Foy graduated from Kenyon College in 1979 and later worked for two Democratic Ohio state senators. After several years, he attended North Carolina Central University School of Law studying environmental law. Foy paid attention to land-use decisions made by the town of Chapel Hill and noted that in 1995 the town was \\"a really nice place that was going to be exploited by people selling it out.\\" ==Career== 1995‚Äì2001: Litigation and town council Foy and his neighbors sued Chapel Hill in 1995 to prevent development that the town had approved of 15 houses in a floodplain of . Foy did some of the legal work to save on costs. They lost the case (Lloyd vs. Chapel Hill) at both the district and appellate levels, though the town renegotiated with the developer to keep the space open. He ran for mayor in 1995 after he and his neighborhood had lost a second land-use case to the town. He and several other neighborhood groups opposed the then-proposed development of Meadowmont, North Carolina. The incumbent mayor, Kenneth Broun, was not seeking reelection, so Foy ran against town council member Rosemary Waldorf. Foy was labeled an \\"antigrowth\\" candidate, which he said was inaccurate, and he was seen as a newcomer to the town. He was endorsed by the Sierra Club and the Independent Weekly. Foy spent $3,000 and lost the election receiving 46 percent of the vote. In his 1997 campaign for town council, Foy again received endorsements from the Sierra Club and the Independent Weekly as well as support from several sitting members. He received the second-highest number of votes among the eight candidates, securing a seat. He was sworn in to town council on December 1, 1997. He decided not to run for mayor in 1999, only two years into his four- year town-council term and thought Waldorf was doing a good job. 2001‚Äì2009: Mayoralty Mayor Waldorf decided not to run for a third term in 2001, prompting Foy to enter the race. He ran against Lee Pavao, a fellow town council member. Donations from individuals were limited to $200; each candidate spent $25,000 on the campaign. Foy's campaign focused on three things: protecting the environment; inclusivity, like affordable housing; and university‚Äìtown relations. Pavao, a businessman, supported Meadowmont's development, though both were in favor of \\"smart growth\\". During the election, Foy continued running his law practice. He won by a considerable margin, against expectations that the race would be closer. Foy was sworn in as Mayor of Chapel Hill for his first two-year term on December 3, 2001. He was reelected in 2003 against just write-in votes and in 2005 against a \\"stealth candidate\\" who had moved to Chapel Hill just a week before the filing day. Local news noted that Foy had done a similar thing in 1995. The \\"stealth candidate\\", Kevin A. Wolff, ran again in 2007. As mayor, Foy negotiated the expansion of the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Several times, UNC wanted to expand, so community members spoke in opposition to the town council, and the mayor and council generally approved the expansion if it was appropriate. He also formed a downtown partnership group with input from UNC and businesses on Franklin Street. After town manager Cal Horton's resignation in September 2006, Foy selected Roger Stancil to fill the position, who was unanimously confirmed by the council. Foy was the chair of the state's Metropolitan Mayor's Coalition, promoting the fare- free Chapel Hill Transit (CHT) and asking the Department of Transportation to keep maintaining major roads. He kept CHT from merging with the Triangle Transit Authority in 2003 and kept the town library separate from that of the county. Foy has remarked that his two main achievements while in office were rewriting the town's land-use ordinance and renaming a main thoroughfare in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. The town manager (Horton) had recommended an elaborate process for citizen input about land use, which tired some town council members, though Foy kept up the energy to secure reform. Airport Road (part of NC Hwy. 86) was renamed Martin Luther King Boulevard, which raised tensions in Chapel Hill over financial concerns of changing addresses on paper, giving up a long-time address, and race. The United States Conference of Mayors awarded Foy the Climate Protection Outstanding Achievement Award in June 2008 and named Chapel Hill America's Most Livable City in June 2009. Foy and the council asked the state legislature to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (1996) and had Chapel Hill grant domestic partnerships. Foy did not seek reelection in 2009 and considered a run for U.S. Senate in 2010. Support for incumbent senator Richard Burr, however, was greater than that of any Democrat, including Foy. Foy endorsed the 2009 campaign of his eventual successor, Mark Kleinschmidt. Post-mayoralty Foy teaches courses on environmental law, businesses, remedies, and torts at North Carolina Central University School of Law, where he received his Juris Doctor degree. ==Electoral historySee also== * List of mayors of Chapel Hill, North Carolina ==References== ;Bibliography * Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:Mayors of Chapel Hill, North Carolina Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:North Carolina lawyers Category:North Carolina Central University alumni Category:North Carolina Central University faculty Category:North Carolina city council members ","title":"Kevin Foy"},{"id":"56120016","text":"The Friars' Walk drill hall is a former military installation in Stafford. ==History== The building was designed by Hanley, architects, as the headquarters of the Staffordshire Yeomanry and was completed in November 1913.

However, the fee for these assets is usually calculated separately, so in reality it is a remuneration for the transfer of functions or risks excluding assets. == References == Category:Accounting terminology Category:International taxation Category:Pricing Category:Restructuring ","title":"Exit fee"},{"id":"56120058","text":"Pablo Nicolas Heredia (born 11 June 1990) is an Argentine-born Chilean professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for San Luis. ==Career== Club Heredia began with San Martin de R√≠o Grande, prior to joining Belgrano in 2005.

Necroplanetology is the related study of such a process. Nonetheless, the result of such a disruption may be the production of excessive amounts of related gas, dust and debris, that may eventually surround the parent star in the form of a circumstellar disk or debris disk. As a consequence, the orbiting debris field may be an \\"uneven ring of dust\\", causing erratic light fluctuations in the apparent luminosity of the parent star, as may have been responsible for the oddly flickering light curves associated with the starlight observed from certain variable stars, such as that from Tabby's Star (KIC 8462852), RZ Piscium and WD 1145+017. Excessive amounts of infrared radiation may be detected from such stars, suggestive evidence in itself that dust and debris may be orbiting the stars. == Examples == Planets Examples of planets, or their related remnants, considered to have been a disrupted planet, or part of such a planet, include: 'Oumuamua and WD 1145+017 b, as well as asteroids, hot Jupiters and those that are hypothetical planets, like Fifth planet, Phaeton, Planet V and Theia.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these irregular changes, but none to date fully explain all aspects of the curve. One explanation is that an \\"uneven ring of dust\\" orbits Tabby's Star. However, in September 2019, astronomers reported that the observed dimmings of Tabby's Star may have been produced by fragments resulting from the disruption of an orphaned exomoon.

He pioneered the capture and study of live sharks and for several decades was considered one of the world's foremost experts on shark anatomy and behavior. Over the course of his life, Gilbert published two books and approximately 150 scientific papers. As a recipient of both Carnegie and Guggenheim Fellowships and chair of the American Institute of Biological Sciences' Shark Research Panel, Gilbert travelled the world to better learn and understand shark behavior. == Early life and education == Gilbert was born December 1, 1912 to Scott and Hester Gilbert in North Branford, Connecticut.Adler, K., Anderson, J., Leonard, S., Evans, H., \\"Perry Webster Gilbert.\\" Cornell University Faculty Memorial Statement. 2000. Retrieved from: https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/18632/Gilbert_Perry_Webster_2000.pdf;jsessionid=62BE256EBE676A14C7D1DCACFB6201AE?sequence=2 He also had a sister, two years younger, named Eleanor. When Gilbert was a child, the family would frequently spend time on the seashore, developing in him an early appreciation for marine life that would be reignited in his academic career. His father Scott, a carpenter and homebuilder, would take Gilbert fishing, treading for clams, and tonging for oysters. As a child, Gilbert started his schooling in a one-room schoolhouse in his hometown of North Branford, but his mother ultimately proved to be dissatisfied with the quality of the education that the school provided. She sent him to a school of 600 students in New Haven, Connecticut, about 10 miles away by trolley. While he was initially labeled as a ‚Äúhick‚Äù by his classmates, Gilbert would often invite classmates to his family's farm and by his last year in school he had become the class president. Eventually, Gilbert's parents were forced to sell the family home to make way for a new city reservoir, and the Gilberts relocated to nearby Branford, a town on the coast of Long Island Sound. As Gilbert continued his education at Branford High School, he spent his free time collecting wildlife specimens, including butterflies and moths, often studying books on them. He also spent his summers working at a cemetery digging graves and mowing lawns, during which time he learned much from the sexton‚Äôs father about budding roses, grafting plants, and raising evergreens. Upon graduating high school, Gilbert was accepted into Dartmouth College, and - although his father's business had been destroyed by the Depression - his aunt was able to provide funding for his college education. == Academic career == Gilbert initially entered Dartmouth College in 1930, studying both vertebrate anatomy under Professor William Ballard and histology and embryology under Professor Norman Arnold. He graduated in 1934 with a bachelor's degree in zoology, and continued on at Dartmouth as an instructor for two years. In 1936, Gilbert decided to pursue his Ph.D. and with financial support from a Cramer Fellowship he started his doctoral research on comparative anatomy of burrowing and terrestrial sciurid mammals at Cornell University. Under the advisement of mammalogist William J. Hamilton II, Gilbert achieved his doctorate in 1940 and was immediately hired as in instructor in Cornell's Department of Zoology by Chairman Benjamin Young. Gilbert ended up having a long career at Cornell, and was continuously affiliated with the University for 64 years. He began as an instructor, being promoted to an Assistant Professor in 1943, a Tenured Associate Professor in 1946, and ultimately to a Professor of Zoology from 1952-1978. Thereafter, Gilbert served as a Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior, Emeritus. He taught Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy during fall, spring, and often summer terms from 1940-1967, a course which was known for its large enrollment as it was a requirement for entrance to most medical schools. During World War II, Gilbert taught comparative anatomy to the pre-medical corps of the U.S. Army and Navy for six days a week, every week for a year except Christmas Day. Gilbert was known among the student population for drawing multi-colored, symmetrical drawings on the chalkboard using both hands simultaneously, and for giving summative philosophical thoughts at the end of each lecture. He also kept a collection of note cards with details on every one of his students, which he used to remember particulars of over 5000 students in the course of his career. During Gilbert's time at Cornell, the University underwent a departmental reorganization that resulted in the formation of the Division of Biological Sciences, in which Gilbert chose to join the new Section of Neurobiology and Behavior, which is now the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior. Robert Hueter, Senior Scientist, Director of the Center of Shark Research, and Perry W. Gilbert Chair in Shark Research at Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium, has written that ‚ÄúThousands of professionals in the biological sciences today - and certainly those in comparative anatomy, functional morphology, neurobiology and even ichthyology - can trace their roots to some relationship with Perry Gilbert the teacher‚Äù. == Personal life == Soon after arriving at Cornell, Gilbert met Claire Rachel Kelly in Hamilton's mammalogy class. She was pursuing her bachelor's at Cornell, and on September 3, 1938 the two were married. The couple began their married life in Ithaca on Linden Avenue in Collegetown, later moved to a farm on Coddington Road, and eventually settled on the Parkway. When Gilbert gained his position as Director of Mote Marine Laboratory in 1967, the Gilberts relocated from Ithaca to Sarasota. They had eight children together, including five sons - David, Stephen, John, Christopher, and Philip - and three daughters - Anne, Mary, and Lois. The family also owned a farmhouse on the Danby Hills, known as ‚Äúthe Nob‚Äù which served as a seasonal vacation retreat as well as a site for social gatherings of Gilbert's colleagues, students, and friends. Claire Kelly Gilbert edited Gilbert's publications and co-authored several of them. Claire learned Russian and Italian in order to translate scientific treatises on sharks. In Sarasota, she volunteered at St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Shop and sang alto in the choir at Incarnation Church. Following the death of her husband, Claire sold the home in Siesta Key in 2002 and moved to an Ithacare Community in Ithaca called Longview. She died of a stroke at the age of 92. == Early academic work == Early on, Gilbert's academic work varied widely in nature. Gilbert's first published academic paper, initially penned in 1935 during his time at Dartmouth, focused on the structure and function of avian lungs and air sacs; this paper was ultimately published in 1939. He went on to write his 1940 doctoral dissertation on the anatomy of burrowing squirrels, particularly the woodchuck. In 1949, Gilbert took his first sabbatical as a Carnegie Fellow in Embryology. He worked with Dr. George Corner at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and ultimately this fellowship resulted in several publications including an illustrated monograph on the origin and development of the human extrinsic eye muscles. == Research in shark biology and behavior == As a professor, Gilbert oversaw the dissections of many animal specimens but took special interest in the biology of dogfish sharks. Here his interest in shark biology appears to have begun. Gilbert's first published paper on sharks was focused specifically on the male urogenital system of the frilled shark, published in Copeia in 1941. He supplemented this first article two years later with an additional paper on the male frilled shark anatomy, published in the Journal of Morphology in 1943. Gilbert's interest and expertise in sharks grew over the course of his career, growing to dominate his academic work in the coming decades. Gilbert went on to study male spiny dogfish and smooth dogfish at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in the mid-1950s, resulting in papers about the functional morphology of shark claspers and siphon sacs. The late 1950s, and 1957 in particular, proved to be fruitful for Gilbert's emerging shark research. During 1957 and 1958, he studied at Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Maine, using radioactive tracers to observe the transfer of nutrients between mothers and embryos in spiny dogfish. This work was accomplished with the help of his eldest son, David, who was a student at Harvard at the time. In 1957, Gilbert and his colleague F. G. Wood made a breakthrough while conducting research at Marineland in Florida, and inventing an anesthetic named MS 222 that could be sprayed into the gills of large sharks, ultimately publishing a widely cited paper on the subject in Science in 1957. Gilbert went on his second sabbatical in 1957, with the support of a Guggenheim Fellowship, studying sharks at the Lerner Marine Laboratory in Bimini. Over the course of his career, Gilbert conducted research - primarily shark-focused, but also including other marine life - at a wide array of research facilities, including: the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts; Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Maine; Lerner Marine Laboratory in the Bahamas; Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Florida (which later became Mote Marine Laboratory, under Gilbert's directorship: see below); Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California; and various other labs in Florida, Hawaii, South Africa, Australia, Japan, and the South Seas. During his career, Gilbert also led scientific expeditions in Tahiti and British Honduras. == Work with the Office of Naval Research == Gilbert's growing expertise around sharks eventually drew the attention of the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Concurrently with Gilbert's research efforts, ONR was funding research around methods for repelling shark attacks, which had been reported as a problem for shipwrecked navy personnel and downed pilots during World War II. In 1957, Sid Galler of ONR approached Gilbert and asked him to serve as the chair of the American Institute of Biological Sciences‚Äô ONR-funded Shark Research Panel. As the chair of the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert was tasked with traveling around the world to encourage, coordinate, and direct programs in shark research, as well as to conduct his own research as needed. While the ONR work had initially been specifically focused on developing some sort of shark repellent, Gilbert helped convince them to \\"support a broad program in basic research, opening the door to a new era of scientific studies on sharks around the world\\". Between 1960 and 1969, Gilbert authored more than 40 scientific articles on sharks, including research relating to sharks‚Äô vision, bite force, chemoreception, attack behavior, and methods for repelling them. Gilbert's early work with ONR also resulted in the publication of the edited volume \\"Sharks and Survival\\" (1963), a collection of peer reviewed papers with contributions from experts in the field. As a part of his work with the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert helped to plan and coordinate two major symposia on shark research. One of these symposia was held at Lerner Marine Laboratory in the Bahamas. The symposium collected 70 researchers, twelve of whom were affiliated with Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL), where Gilbert had done work himself in the late 1950s. The result of this symposium was the edited volume ‚ÄúSharks, Skates, and Rays,\\" published in 1967, which included papers on shark anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, and life history. According to Robert Hueter, \\"practically every thread of contemporary research on the biology and behavior of sharks since 1960 can be traced back to the ONR program guided by the scholarly leadership of Perry Gilbert\\". == Directorship of Mote Marine Laboratory == In 1955, the Vanderbilt family established the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Placida, Florida and placed it under the direction of Eugenie Clark. Clark oversaw the movement of the laboratory from Placida to Siesta Key in 1960. By 1965, however, Clark decided to resign her directorship for personal reasons and the position was open to fill. After two interim directors and a generous contribution from William R. Mote to keep the laboratory afloat, Gilbert was approached by the search committee to be the new director of what would become Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium. During the early-to-mid 1960s, Gilbert had carried on much of his research here as a Visiting Fellow, and was well known by the deciding board. When offered the position in 1967, Gilbert only agreed to work as an interim director. He ultimately maintained his professorship at Cornell by returning to Ithaca for some weeks each year to give lectures and consult with students and colleagues; in return, Cornell gained from policies that allowed students and faculty to access Mote Laboratory's equipment and research facilities. His position as director of Mote was soon changed from Interim Director to Permanent Director Under Gilbert's leadership, the laboratory became known as a center of excellence in a variety of marine research disciplines, not least of which related to shark research. Funding from ONR allowed for the construction of a large, elaborate shark-holding facility, which provided new opportunities for the observation and study of life sharks in safe and controlled conditions for the first time. Meanwhile, Gilbert continued his own research and published many papers with the help of collaborators, stimulating others to follow suit. Gilbert also expanded the scope of Mote's research to include biomedicine, microbiology, neurobiology and behavior, ecology, and environmental health by inviting specialists in these fields to work as visiting investigators at Mote. He used contacts that he had cultivated over his 30-year career to help boost the reputation and breadth of research in the facility, often soliciting experts from other universities, museums, and the National Institutes of Health. In the mid-1970s, it became clear that the laboratory would need to be moved once again due to various problems, including coastal erosion of the Siesta Key. Gilbert took on the planning, design, local politicking, and fundraising for the move, and oversaw the creation of Mote's current facility on City Island in Sarasota, Florida. The new facility was much larger, with further growth in mind. Following this move, Gilbert retired as Director in 1978. == Retirement and death == Upon his retirement as Director of Mote Marine Laboratory in 1978, Gilbert continued to work as Mote Senior Scientist and member of the Board of Trustees. A new education building was named in his honor, and the endowed ‚ÄúPerry W. Gilbert Chair in Shark Research‚Äù was established. When he retired from Cornell, he was honored with a symposium of distinguished speakers, a banquet, and the establishment of an endowed ‚ÄúPerry Gilbert Lectureship in Comparative Anatomy and Behavior‚Äù. Perry Gilbert died on October 15, 2000 at his home in Sarasota, FL. == References == Category:1912 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Cornell University faculty Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:American marine biologists Category:Carnegie Mellon University fellows Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Perry Webster Gilbert"},{"id":"56120141","text":"is a Japanese athlete.

Probably built about 1754, it is a well-preserved example of period rural vernacular residential architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Description and history== The John Wiard House stands in a rural setting northwest of the village center of Burlington, on the northeast corner of Upson Road and Spielman Highway (Connecticut Route 4). It is set well back from the highway, which originally passed much closer to its front door. The house is a 1-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays, with a central entrance flanked by symmetrically placed sash windows. The doorway is topped by four-light transom window. A single-story gabled addition extends to the rear of the main block. The interior has a significant number of original period features, including fireplace surrounds, builtin cabinets, flooring, doors, and hardware. Some features date to a c. 1810 renovation. The land on which the house stands was purchased by John Wiard in 1754, and it is assumed he built this house not long afterward. Wiard was one of the first English settlers in the area that was later incorporated as Burlington. Wiard's father was one of the major landowners in Farmington, which the area was then part of. The early 19th- century alterations to the house were probably made by John's son Seth. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1754 Category:Houses in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Burlington, Connecticut ","title":"John Wiard House"},{"id":"56120161","text":"Satpal Raizada is an Indian politician from the Indian National Congress and a member of the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly representing the Una assembly constituency of Himachal Pradesh.

The federal government recognized this point for measuring the boundary between the United States and Mexico after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ended.

The tour only visited the United States, with Brown performing over 30 concerts during the spring of 2017. It is reported the tour earned $18.7 million. ==Background== After the cancellation of his boxing match, Brown announced the tour on his Instagram account. The tour was officially announced in February 2017. Similar to his previous tour, the bill featured numerous artists in the Hip hop and R&B; scene. The two biggest names were 50 Cent and French Montana. While Montana was on the initial roster, his name was later removed when the tour was officially announced. 50 Cent dropped out of the tour last minute. Many media outlets reported disagreements with production as the reason for the cancellation. The rapper claimed his contract was never finalized and he was still filming a movie during the time of the tour. ==Critical reception== The tour received mixed reviews from critics. Nathan Paige (The Plain Dealer) writes the show in Cleveland did a good job of showcasing his talents. He continues: \\"Even though Brown's stint in Cleveland was solely to showcase his talents and appease his fans, it's difficult to write an objective review without thinking of some of his unfavorable behavior in recent years. Brown's fans either love him despite his flaws, or used to love him, and no longer support his music. By the time he took the stage, The Q was nearly full - a sign that this talented singer/dancer/actor still has a strong fan base in Ohio\\". Ross Raihala of the St. Paul Pioneer Press stated: \\"The sparse, wide-open stage served as a screen and showed various graphics timed to the beats and sometimes footage from Brown‚Äôs videos, like the racy ‚ÄúPrivacy.‚Äù Given all the flashing lights and booming bass, though, Brown did sometimes seem to get lost at his own party. There were some fun moments for sure ‚Äì particularly ‚ÄúTime for Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúAyo‚Äù ‚Äì but ultimately it felt like Brown‚Äôs talent has gone to waste\\". Chris Riemenschneider (Star Tribune) shared the thoughts on the concert in Saint Paul. He says: \\"Brown's performance was still far from comeback-level. His voice has plenty of velvety power left in it, as he proved early on in a dramatic 'Deuces,' and he still shows traces of Michael Jackson in his stylish dance moves, which he reiterated in the show finale, 'Party'. [...] Brown stopped and started a lot for outfit changes, and the momentum never really got going.\\". For the show in Lincoln, L. Keny Wolgamott of the Lincoln Journal Star wrote: \\"They put on a high energy show with some good tricks -- starting with Brown's entrance from underneath the video cube above the center of the stage, flipping around on some wires before he hit the stage\\". ==Opening acts== *O.T.

Payne. Stephan was also an NATO PDF with Dick Holm at Harvard from 1980-1982. ==Research and career== Stephan's work uses fundamental studies to develop new methods for producing useful chemical products. He is best known for his work on frustrated Lewis pairs, which has enabled the development of metal-free methods of hydrogenation catalysis. Stephan has also devised new approaches for the activation of small molecules such as alkynes and olefins. Other highlights include research on compounds that contain both early and late transition elements, and studies of the chemistry of both zirconium‚Äìphosphorus complexes and catalytic phosphorus‚Äìphosphorus bonds. In his early career, Stephan's work provided new insights and understanding of ligand design and synthesis for reactivity and catalysis. In the 1980s and 1990s, his work focused on synthesis and applications of \\"early-late\\" heterobimetallic complexes, zirconium-phosphorus and titanium-sulfur chemistry. In the mid-1990s, Stephan discovered a new class of olefin polymerization catalysts, that was commercialized in NOVA Chemical's plant in Joffre, Alberta, Canda, the largest solution polymerization plant in the world. This development placed Stephan as one of a handful of chemists worldwide whose fundamental advances have translated to commercial success, widespread use and impact. Awards and honours Prof. Stephan has received considerable recognition for his work including the 2001 Alcan Award (top award for Canadian inorganic chemistry). He received an Av Humboldt Foundation Senior Research Award in 2002, the 2003 NSERC Synergy Award, the 2004 Ciapetta Lectureship Award from the North American Catalysis Soc., and the 2005 LeSueur Memorial Award from the Canadian Soc. Chemical Industry, 2005. He was appointed as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2005. Stephan was also appointed a Canada Research Chair appointments at Windsor in 2005 and in Toronto in 2008 and reappointed in 2015. He has been awarded a Killam Research Fellowship (2009-2011), a re- invitation from the Humboldt Foundation for a Senior Research Award (2011) and the Ludwig Mond Award and Lectureship (Royal Soc. Chemistry UK, 2012) and the 2013 H.M. Tory Medal from the Royal Society of Canada. In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (London), We note that the only other U of T Chemist with this distinction is Nobel Laureate John Polanyi. In 2014, he was elected a Corresponding Member of North-Rhein-Westfaelia Academy of the Sciences and Arts (Germany) and was awarded Applied Catalysis Award (Royal Society of Chemistry, UK), Canadian Green Chemistry and Engineering Award and CIC Medal (Chemical Institute of Canada). In 2015, he was a Distinguished Adjunct Professor, King Abdulaziz University and became only the second chemist to be named an Einstein Visiting Fellow at the Technical University of Berlin for 2016-2019.

Family members involved in the radio operations included five siblings, Gerald \\"Jerry\\" Bartell, Melvin Bartell, Lee Bartell, David Bartell, Rosa Bartell Evans, and one sibling-in-law, Ralph Evans. Several of them got their start in while attending the University of Wisconsin and participating in the operations of university-owned station WHA. They entered the radio business with Milwaukee station WEXT in 1947, on the belief that between them they had expertise in law, engineering, music, writing, and acting, all of which would prove useful in the field. Some of the more well- known stations the Bartell Group owned include WOKY in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, KCBQ in San Diego, California, KRUX 1360 in Phoenix, Arizona, and Spanish- language WADO in New York City. The family also owned a few television stations, including WMTV-TV in Madison, Wisconsin and Telecura√ßao and Telearuba in the Caribbean. The family members left the radio business in 1968, but the Bartell Media Corporation name carried on into much of the 1970s. The Bartell Group was an important broadcasting entity during the post- World War II era and helped pioneer the Top 40 radio format. Three of the Bartell family members have been inducted into the Wisconsin Broadcasters Hall of Fame. ==Family origins== The Bartell siblings were the children of Russian Jews Benjamin and Lena Beznor. The father immigrated to the United States in 1911, with the mother following in 1913, as part of the wave of Central and Eastern European Jews who came to America. (Other accounts place the parents coming in 1913 or later.) Three of the children were born in Belopolye in Russia:Sometimes written as Belapol or Belapoli, and currently located in the Ukraine. Belle (1906‚Äì2005), David B.(1908‚Äì2006), and Lee K. (1910‚Äì1991), while three of the children were born once the family was in the United States: Gerald A. \\"Jerry\\" (1914‚Äì1990) in Chicago, Illinois, and Melvin (1916‚Äì2006) and Elizabeth Robbin \\"Rosa\\" (1918‚Äì2009) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Belle was the only one of the siblings that did not become involved in the family radio business. The family name of Beznor gradually evolved to Bartell, with it being done first by those siblings who were public performers. So while the first public mentions of Gerald in 1937 have him using Bartell, as late as 1949 and then 1953, David and Lee were still using Beznor in their public business work, until they switched too for consistency. ==An interest in radio== The family's interest in radio began with Gerald Bartell's time at the University of Wisconsin during the 1930s, when he was on the student staff of university-owned station WHA. As one university history states, Gerald was \\"a talented student with natural ability for acting and producing.\\" After graduating in 1937 with a B.A. in economics, he remained a staff member there as he entered graduate school, gaining a master's degree in 1939. During his time in school he also sometimes worked in Chicago as an actor in network radio soap operas. He also barked like a canine in a commercial for Red Heart dog food. Reproduction of the author's 1972 Ph.D. thesis at the University of Wisconsin. Gerald subsequently became part of the faculty at the University of Wisconsin, being named an assistant professor of radio education in the Department of Speech in 1940. While on the faculty he took advantage of a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and worked at NBC in New York in sales, merchandising, and production tasks. Melvin also was on the student staff at WHA and was a popular figure on the air through his graduation in 1938. An aspiring opera singer, he then went to the University of Rochester to attend its Eastman School of Music, from where he gained a degree in 1941. While in Rochester he worked at radio station WHAM. Rosa too was a student at the University of Wisconsin and on the staff at WHA, where she was a singer, songwriter, program produceer, and music librarian. There she met Ralph Evans, an electrical engineering student who worked at the station as a broadcast engineer, and they subsequently married a couple of years later. ==Family in World War II== Captain Melvin Bartell served in the United States Army in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II as part of the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). This operation was running the Far East Network through the Pacific, which provided important morale support to the armed forces engaged in the U.S. island-hopping campaign. Bartell was attached to the headquarters command of General Douglas MacArthur. JOAK radio in Tokyo, here seen in the 1930s Following the formal Japanese surrender that concluded the war, Bartell was part of the occupation of Japan. Bartell was put in charge of the takeover of JOAK, Tokyo's 50,000-watt radio station that had featured the broadcasts of Tokyo Rose. The station, which renamed itself as WVTR, was the first Armed Forces Radio station on air in Japan, signing-on with the phrase, \\"This is Armed Forces Radio Service, Station WVTR in Tokyo\\" on September 12, 1945. On the station Bartell devoted the programming to original shows about the occupation, overseas Army shows such as Command Performance, as well as rebroadcasts of popular American shows. In addition to directing the programming, Melvin also appeared on-air. Meanwhile, Rosa and Ralph Evans moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked as a civilian for the United States Navy in classified research into radar. She worked in personnel for the United States Naval Research Laboratory. She also worked at radio station WTOP in Washington for Arthur Godfrey, selecting records for him, in the period before he became nationally known. Gerald Bartell enlisted into the United States Navy and at first was assigned to teach courses at a naval training school for radio operators that had been established on the university campus. Year is uncertain, maybe 1957? Following that he became a naval aviation ensign and served for three years with the VPB-92 patrol bombing squadron including off the coast of Morocco during the North African Campaign. ==Entering the radio business in Milwaukee== By January 1946, Melvin Bartell had returned to the United States. Following his discharge, he pursued a career as a singer. Rosa and Ralph Evans returned to Wisconsin, where he finished his engineering degree. David and Lee had become a lawyers, and Gerald was again on the faculty at University of Wisconsin, where he was assistant professor of radio education. Lee Bartell heard that broadcasting would probably be a good business to be in the post-war environment and, as Rosa later said, he \\"had this idea for us to go into the broadcasting business, because our respective professions included law, engineering, music, writing and acting. He felt that among the six of us, we had all the talent and expertise needed for a successful venture.\\" The family raised $50,000 towards this new endeavor.MacFarland, The Development of the Top 40 Radio Format, p. 239. The Bartells had their origin in radio in the Milwaukee area, in the form of WEXT, a 1,000-watt daytimer radio station at 1430 kilocycles in Milwaukee. It was founded by Lee, David, Gerald, and Rosa Bartell Evans and began operations on August 31, 1947. Its studio was located on Milwaukee's South Side. The Milwaukee market's fifth radio station, WEXT did fairly well with a broadcast schedule that included popular music and ethnic programming, including a polka music show hosted by local radio legend John Reddy. Officially, Gerald was listed as station president, Rosa as program director, and Ralph was chief engineer. The programming also included \\"Playtime for Children\\", a program narrated and sung by Gerald Bartell. These were recorded on tape and sent to a variety of radio stations around the state, including even other stations in Milwaukee such as WIBA. The program was aimed at pre-school children and those in nursery schools and kindergarten. Rosa appeared on that program as the \\"Lullaby Lady\\" and she was also the show's producer, collecting many of the elements that went in it. The program became popular with children, and in 1948 Billboard magazine named it the best children's program in the nation from a radio station in the 250‚Äì to 1,000-watt range. The magazine said that \\"Jerry Bartell, headman of the program, showed a deft touch in his handling of perhaps the most difficult type of children's show, one which all too often is completely ignored by many stations. ... Bartell's warbling ... is swell. It has resonance, and kids can probably ascertain that his heart is in it ... the show is well-produced, well-written, and certainly well-thought out.\\" See also \\"Reviews of Winning Programs\\" on pages 6, 11. With WEXT finding an audience but only barely profitable, the Bartell family applied for full-time broadcast operations, and the result was a move down the dial to AM 920 and a new call sign, WOKY. In doing so they formed a new company named the Bartell Group. WOKY launched in September 1950. WOKY initially aired a full-service variety format similar to WEXT's, including popular music shows and programs oriented toward housewives and children. This included the continuation of Playtime for Children. Audience figures went up once the station concentrated on a music- and-news format. WOKY is also noteworthy for being the first station in Milwaukee to broadcast traffic reports from a helicopter, courtesy of air personality Art Zander and his feature \\"The Safer Route\\". By October 1952, WOKY was the third-most popular radio station in the city. ==Musical activities== Melvin did not join in the radio business right away. Still pursuing his singing career, he appeared in the opera Street Scene on Broadway in 1947. The following year, he received honorable mention in American Theater Wing auditions to perform a debut recital. That led to an engagement to sing leading baritone roles with the Covent Garden Opera in London during 1949. He lived in Italy for a while and sang there, then went on to become a regular performer for the Florentine Opera Company in Milwaukee, and by 1958 was president of that organization. Gerald Bartell, meanwhile, capitalized on his children's program to release a series of children's 78 rpm phonograph records under the name Jerry Bartell. The first of these came out in 1948 and was called Tingo, the Story of a Clown, a 12-minute tale that had been written by his wife Joyce. They featured him playing the characters and singing the songs. Subsequent releases included the song collections Playtime and Jerry Bartell's Playtime Album in 1949, and Pat and the Pixies and The Men Who Come To Our House in 1950, both of which his wife Joyce wrote the stories for. In a review, Billboard said of Pat and the Pixies that it was a \\"sensitive\\" and \\"warm\\" adaptation of an Irish folk tale, but that Bartell's following from Playtime for Children was not big enough to expect large-scale sales of the record. In addition Bartell appeared on television in the program Playtime with Jerry, a 15-minute show that was syndicated to stations such as KTVI-TV Channel 2 in St. Louis, which broadcast it on Saturday mornings during 1957‚Äì58. ==Expansion== The Bartell family expanded to radio stations beyond Milwaukee. The full list of radio stations included: * WEXT 1430 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1947, shut down 1950 * WTWT 1010 in Stevens Point, Wisconsin in 1948 * WOKW in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin in early 1950s (subsequently went dark) * WOKY 920 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1950 * WAPL 1570 in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1952MacFarland, The Development of the Top 40 Radio Format, p. 162. * KCHA 1580 in Charles City, Iowa in early 1950s * WAKE 1340 in Atlanta, Georgia, bought 1955, sold 1962, broadcast from the Georgian Terrace Hotel * KCBQ 1170 in San Diego, California, bought 1955 * KRUX 1360 in Phoenix, Arizona, bought 1955 * WYDE 850 in Birmingham, Alabama, bought 1957 * WILD 1090 in Boston, Massachusetts, bought 1957, sold 1966 * KYA 1260 in San Francisco, California, bought 1958, sold 1962 * WADO 1280, a Spanish language station in New York City, bought 1959 Some of the smaller stations were sold as the family entered larger markets. By 1960 the family owned six radio stations. The Bartells also entered into the television market. WMTV-TV Channel 33 began operations in Madison in July 1953 with Gerald Bartell managing it. One of the main programs on it was the culinary show What's Cookin, hosted by pioneering African American chef Carson Gulley and his wife Beatrice. They became among the first black hosts of a television show anywhere in the United States, and despite receiving hate mail on the subject, Bartell did not back down from having them as hosts and the show ran for the next nine years. This was followed by WOKY-TV Channel 19 in Milwaukee in October 1953. It was bought by CBS the following year. The Bartell Group also became involved in the creation of Telecura√ßao and Telearuba, television stations in the Caribbean islands of Cura√ßao and Aruba, with the former starting in 1960 and the latter in 1963. The government of the Netherlands Antilles joined with the Bartell Group to form the Netherlands Antilles Television & Electronic Company. Each station was on the air for about eight hours per day. The full list of family television stations thus included: * WMTV-TV Channel 33 in Madison, Wisconsin in 1953 * WOKY-TV Channel 19 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1953, sold in 1954 * Telecura√ßao, begun 1960 * Telearuba, begun 1963 A trade magazine advertisement for Bartell Family Radio in 1957 Gerald Bartell also appeared on air on these television stations, including one amusing episode in July 1961 when he interviewed Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who a few months earlier had become the first human to travel in outer space when he orbited the Earth. Gugarin was in Willemstad in Cura√ßao when Bartell was able to become the first American press member to get a private interview with the cosmonaut, apparently because Gugarin assumed Bartell was a Cura√ßao local and not an American. Gugarin told Bartell that he expected to fly to the moon on his next assignment. With this being the height of the Space Race, in which the Soviets were ahead at the time, American interest in the interview was piqued and General Maxwell D. Taylor, a top military advisor to President John F. Kennedy, called Bartell to find out if Gagarin had revealed a moon mission schedule and to find out the interviewer's impressions of the cosmonaut. Gerald Bartell was president of the Bartell Group. In 1956, Broadcasting/Telecasting magazine said that he had \\"combined a talent for artistry, a perspicacity for business and a decided penchant for perfection into a small empire builder in the past nine years.\\" During 1957 Bartell trade advertisements began to stress the notion of family radio, although Gerald Bartell later conceded that it was more of a marketing gimmick than a real difference in what music the station played.MacFarland, The Development of the Top 40 Radio Format, pp. 245, 247. In any case, by 1958, Bartell Family Radio was termed by Billboard magazine to be \\"one of the most successful chains of radio stations in the industry.\\" ==Pioneers of Top 40 radio== In time, pop music became the primary component of WOKY's schedule, with disc jockeys choosing the songs they played based on the Billboard and Cash Box best-seller charts and on local record sales. WOKY served as the city's premier hits-playing station during most of the 1960s and was known for much of that time as the \\"Mighty 92\\". The Top 40 radio format was coming into being during the 1950s and on; Northern Michigan University scholar Charles F. Ganzert has written that the innovation of the Top 40 format helped keep radio a viable business after the advent of the television era. The format was not developed all in one place or at one time, and other contributors during this time including Todd Storz and Gordon McLendon as well as Plough Broadcasting, but Ganzert states that the Bartell Group made significant contributions as well. David T. MacFarland has also identified these four as the main creators of the format, with Gerald Bartell as the main force behind the Bartell Group and Harold Krelstein being the same for Plough.MacFarland, The Development of the Top 40 Radio Format, pp. vi, 158. Music author Jim Curtis has written, \\"If we speak of pioneer innovations in Top 40, we must speak of three men: Todd Storz, Gordon McLendon, and Gerald Bartell.\\" Storz and McLendon clearly got the most attention in the radio industry press for their actions, while Bartell got less and Plough none at all.MacFarland, The Development of the Top 40 Radio Format, p. 259. However, Bartell may have benefited from Milwaukee being an out-of-the-way city and thus being able to innovate without purveyors of conventional wisdom telling him what could or could not be done. In particular, while singing commercials had been heard on network broadcast radio before, Bartell stations pioneered the use of customized singing commercials on local radio. Bartell stations also established a \\"hot clock\\" where predetermined pieces of programming would happen at certain times in each hour. The personality of the disc jockey was important; the New York Times described the Bartell formula as being \\"built around the folksy disk- jockey whose musical offerings were interrupted hourly with brief, cacophonous outbursts of news.\\" In continuing on this pathway, WAPL radio made its on-air debut in 1952 operating on a frequency of 1570 under the ownership of the Bartell family. It focused on a music-and-news format. KCBQ in San Diego, which Bartell bought in December 1955, became one of the nation's first rock 'n' roll stations, playing the music of Elvis Presley, Little Richard and others. This would be the home of one of the nation's pioneering Top 40 programming. It was the most popular station in the San Diego area, with an up to 30 percent share of the listening audience. KYA in San Francisco, California was bought by the Bartells in 1958; Lee Bartell became president and general manager and the station switched to a Top 40 format. The Bartells sold it in 1962. In 1958, Gerald Bartell gave a speech to the Wisconsin State Radio Listeners' League in which he discussed the always-present question of commercial appeal versus artistic value, saying that he realized that Jussi Bj√∂rling or Arthur Rubinstein were clearly artistically superior to Liberace or Mario Lanza, but that in any form of art and entertainment, not just radio, \\"all in a measure stand or upon their degree of public acceptance. ... The audience is a great unsophisticated critic. It seems to know what it wants.\\" The Bartells were not always tied to the Top 40 format, however. In May 1959, Bartell Broadcasters acquired New York radio station WOV and then changed its call letters to WADO, with Melvin Bartell running it. The station focused on ethnic programming. During the day, WADO broadcast Top 40 and R&B; music. At night, they ran Italian programming, which thus comprised half their programming. By 1962, some Spanish language programming was run on weekends. By 1963, the only English programming found on WADO was in Sunday religious broadcasts. In 1964, WADO began broadcasting completely in Spanish from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Italian from 8 p.m. to midnight. Overnight, Asian programming was run. By 1966, the station was all Spanish. exact issue unknown. Melvin said in general of the siblings' radio station approach: \\"It is for the whole family, with music for the family. The concept of the Bartell Group is something of interest for everybody, of music, features, news and editorials.\\" ==Macfadden-Bartell era== Until 1960, Bartell Broadcasting Corporation was privately owned. In that year, it became a public company, listed on the over- the-counter market based in New York. For its fiscal year ending June 30, 1960, Bartell Broadcasting's gross income was about $3.1 million, up from $2.7 million the year before. In February 1961, Bartell acquired a controlling interest in Macfadden Publications, primarily a publisher of business magazines. However, due to delays cause by a shareholder suit that was eventually resolved, the merger did not become effective until a year later, when the new company became known as Macfadden-Bartell. Gerald became chairman of the company, Lee the president, and Melvin the secretary. Macfadden-Bartell was listed on the American Stock Exchange. As Financial World magazine noted, while at the time it was common for magazine publishers to buy broadcasting companies to expand their communications offerings, this was a case of the reverse happening. Macfadden's pulp magazine business had been in decline, much as the radio business had been in the 1940s and 1950s with the advent of television; as The New York Times said, \\"The rise of the Bartells stems from a rather simple, if harrowing, formula. They specialize in buying into an industry after other entrepreneurs have decided that the industry is in decline.\\" Initial results of Macfadden-Bartell were positive, with revenues up to nearly $26 million and profits rising by 1963. Lee Bartell said, \\"What we intend to do is to build a total communications complex.\\" In 1965, Macfadden- Bartell was renamed to the Bartell Media Corporation. Melvin becomes executive vice president of Bartell Media Corportion, while Ralph Evans had the position of Vice President for Engineering with it. Bartell Media expanded on Macfadden's book publishing imprint, Bartholomew Houseinitially used by Macfadden to group together stories from its magazines into a book (as in Magic Cook Book from the food editors of True Story Magazine, Great Western Heroes)the imprint expanded into first editions of new material after the purchase by the Bartell Group (Coffee, Tea or Me?, Mannequin: My Life as a Model). For the first half of 1967, Bartell Media Corporation reported revenues of $15 million and earnings of $200,000. But then in November 1967, the brokerage firm Weis, Voisin, Cannon purchased additional stock such that the siblings were for the first time now in the minority, owning only 35‚Äì40 percent of the company. There was a shuffle at the directors level and Melvin and David Bartell were no longer officers of the company, leaving only Gerald and Lee in positions at that level. During 1968, Downe Communications acquired 32 percent of Bartell Media Corporation, as part of a struggle for executive control of the company, which Downe prevailed in. All of the Bartell siblings and in-laws resigned or retired from their positions in Bartell Media Corporation, and a new president, Earl H. Tiffany, was named for Bartell Media Corporation. Gerald did retain a title of executive consultant. After that, the Bartell Media Corporation continued on as a publicly visible entity, but without the involvement of any of the Bartell siblings. Further ownership of Bartell by Downe Communications was approved by federal regulators in 1969. ==Later years== Lee Bartell subsequently became a force in the San Diego area hotel industry, including ownership of the Humphrey's Half Moon Inn and the La Jolla Village Inn. In 1976, Lee Bartell got back into the radio business with station KMJC 910 \\"Magic 91\\" in San Diego. Thus, there was a confusing situation where a Bartell owned a radio station but no Bartells owned the radio stations under the Bartell Media Corporation name. By 1978 the latter was known as Downe Broadcasting and the last vestiges of the Bartell name were gone. Lee Bartell sold KMJC in 1989. He died in San Diego in 1991 at age 81. Gerald Bartell remained active in the arts, including areas that reflected on the Jewish experience. During a 1972 interview with a scholar he seemed to express regret regarding his days in marketing his radio stations, saying \\"I'm glad to get the hell out of it, frankly. I never felt real clean doing it. I never felt as if I were doing the best work that I could do. I feel much more competent doing other things like work in the arts and drama.\\" He died in 1990, in Wisconsin at age 76. By 1991 Melvin was retired and living in San Diego, where much of the extended family gradually migrated to. He died in 2006 at age 89. David Bartell had remained a lawyer; he generally had less to do with the radio business than the other siblings. He died in San Diego in 2006 at age 97. Ralph Evans founded an engineering consulting firm, Evans and Associates, which provided services to both public organizations and agencies. He died in Wisconsin in 2005 at the age of 86. His wife Rosa Evans also worked for Evans and Associates and was active in local Jewish organizations. She died in Wisconsin as well in 2009 at age 90. ==Legacy== The Bartell Theatre in Madison, Wisconsin, here seen in 2013, is named after Gerald Bartell. The Bartell Group is credited with being one of the inventors of the Top 40 radio format. In 2010, a monument to KCBQ was put up in the Santee suburb of San Diego, honoring the station and Lee Bartell's role with it. While many of the Bartell-owned radio stations have switch formats since that era, WADO in New York is still a Spanish-language station. Gerald Bartell and Rosa Bartell Evans have both been inducted into the Wisconsin Broadcasters Hall of Fame, as has Ralph Evans. The Bartell Theatre in Madison, Wisconsin is named after Gerald and is run by the Gerald A. Bartell Community Theatre Foundation. Gerald Bartell has been described in that city's Isthmus newspaper as a \\"Madison theater legend and arts supporter.\\" The Joyce J. and Gerald A. Bartell Award in the Arts is given out yearly by the University of Wisconsin, as one of several awards with which the university's Arts Institute \\"recognizes achievements and professional service, along with supporting future creative endeavors and research.\\" ==References== Category:Defunct broadcasting companies of the United States Category:Defunct radio broadcasting companies of the United States Category:Defunct television broadcasting companies of the United States Category:Mass media companies established in 1947 Category:Mass media companies disestablished in 1968 Category:1947 establishments in Wisconsin Category:American people of Russian- Jewish descent Category:Jewish American entertainers Category:People from Milwaukee Category:People from San Diego ","title":"Bartell Group"},{"id":"56120930","text":"Barkatullah (also spelt as Barakatullah or Barkat Ullah) was a Christian apologist and a convert from Islam.

She is known for her work with modernist photographic techniques in the style known as Texas Bauhaus. Her work is part of the permanent collection of several museums. == Biography == Maples was born in Temple, Texas in 1912. Maples attended Temple High School and graduated from there in 1929. She graduated from the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor with a bachelor of arts in 1933 and then went on to get her Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in 1939. She taught art in the Dallas independent school District between 1937 and 1964 and also taught at the Dallas Museum of Art between 1940 and 1954. Maples was a professor and the head of the Department of Art Education at Southern Methodist University from 1965 to 1978. Maples was the president of the Texas Printmakers from 1945 to 1946 and also served as the organization treasurer from 1950 to 1960. In 1999, she died in Dallas and was buried in the family plot in Temple. == Career == Maples was proficient in painting, ceramics, sculpture, printmaking and weaving. Maples studied printmaking during the summers between 1943 and 1945 with Lawrence Barrett. Maples was influenced in her photography work by Carlotta Corpron, who she worked with at the Texas Women's University (TWU) on weekends. Maples' photography was experimental in nature. She used everyday objects in her photo work, transforming the ordinary into abstract art. Some of her photographs did not use camera work, but instead was created directly in the light room. Maples was included in the 1938 exhibition at the Dallas Museum of Art, \\"Exhibition by Women Artists of Dallas County.\\" In 1944, Maples won an honorable mention for her painting, Satin Glass and Fruit in the Sixth Texas General Exhibition held at the Dallas Museum of Art. In 1959, Maples' print, Summer Madness (1956) was shown in the exhibition, \\"60 Prints by 60 Artists from Local Collections: Post-War Prints 1946-1959.\\" Maples participated in an exhibition at the Dallas Museum of Art in 1990 called \\"Photographic Abstractions: Barbara Maples & Carlotta Corpron.\\" Maples' work is part of the permanent collections of the Dallas Museum of Art, the El Paso Museum of Art and the Amon Carter Museum of American Art.

It is named after Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai, who first defined it in 1930.. As cited by . It would follow from Goldbach's conjecture that every integer greater than one can be represented as a sum of at most three prime numbers. However, finding such a representation could involve solving instances of the subset sum problem, which is computationally difficult. Instead, Pillai considered the following simpler greedy algorithm for finding a representation of n as a sum of primes: choose the first prime in the sum to be the largest prime p that is at most n, and then recursively construct the remaining sum recursively for n-p. If this process reaches zero, it halts. And if it reaches one instead of zero, it must include one in the sum (even though it is not prime), and then halt. For instance, this algorithm represents 122 as 113 + 7 + 2, even though the shorter representations 61 + 61 or 109 + 13 are also possible. The nth number in the Pillai sequence is the smallest number whose greedy representation as a sum of primes (and one) requires n terms. These numbers are :0, 1, 4, 27, 1354, 401429925999155061, ... Each number a(n) in the sequence is the sum of the previous number a(n-1) with a prime number p, the smallest prime whose following prime gap is larger than a(n-1). For instance, the number 27 in the sequence is 4 + 23, where the first prime gap larger than 4 is the one between 23 and 29. Because the prime numbers become less dense as they become larger (as quantified by the prime number theorem), there is always a prime gap larger than any term in the Pillai sequence, so the sequence continues to an infinite number of terms. However, the terms in the sequence grow very rapidly. It has been estimated that expressing the next term in the sequence would require \\"hundreds of millions of digits\\". ==References== Category:Integer sequences Category:Prime numbers ","title":"Pillai sequence"},{"id":"56121105","text":"Judit Schell (born 16 April 1973, Debrecen) is a Hungarian actress and voice actress. == Career == She graduated from the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest in 1995.

Culbreath was a founding editor of the libertarian editorial magazine The Fire Bringer. Culbreath is an objectivist and a libertarian, and she was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom. Her analysis of the Star Trek character Spock, originally published in an issue of The Fire Bringer, was lauded by Gene Roddenberry as the \\"best analysis ever done\\" of the character. Her birthday is cited as c. by The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. == Early life == According to a local newspaper in Colorado Springs, Culbreath operated The Culbreath School in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which opened sometime around 1961. The school offered preparation for GED and CLEP tests, as well as tutoring for students with disabilities and disabled veterans, and reading instruction for all ages. The school had branch offices in Denver, and Cortez. Culbreath is recorded as having attended the first Libertarian Party convention in , as a delegate. Frustrated by the political platform that emerged during the convention, Culbreath \\"filibustered\\" until all anti-war messaging was withdrawn. She later resigned from the party. Sometime before 1977, Culbreath moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She shared a home with her writing partner, Sondra Marshak. She currently resides in Torrance, California near Marshak. == Fannish activity == During the publication run of The Fire Bringer, Culbreath corresponded with Gene Roddenberry. A number of their exchanges were collected in the fifth issue, titled the \\"Star Trek Reprint.\\" Her analysis, \\"Reviews of Art and Achievement: Star Trek: The Man Who Invented a Universe: The Universe He Invented: Star Trek and the Spock Premise,\\" was included in the reprint. Roddenberry praised the article during his appearance at Vul-Con I (1973), saying it was \\"required reading for all Star Trek fans.\\" The article's fanac shorthand title is the \\"Spock Premise.\\" == Career == Culbreath made a number of attempts at writing a Star Trek episode spec script, with Roddenberry's encouragement. Her preferred title for the script was \\"Triangle.\\" Once renewal of the television series proved unlikely, Roddenberry introduced Culbreath to fan writer Jacqueline Lichtenberg, who then introduced Culbreath to Sondra Marshak. Culbreath and Marshak formerly met at a Star Trek convention hosted in the Baton Rouge area sometime later. Marshak and Culbreath went on to co-author four original Star Trek novels, including Triangle (1983), which was based upon and inspired by Culbreath's unfinished script. They also edited two short story anthologies, The New Voyages and its sequel, which collected two of their stories. Culbreath also contributed trivia to The Star Trek Puzzle Manual (1976). And she co-wrote the William Shatner biography Shatner: Where No Man‚Ä¶ (1979) with Marshak and Shatner. Star Trek: The New Voyages (1976) was Culbreath's first professionally published work. However, she was loosely involved with the production of Star Trek Lives! (1975), along with Marshak, Lichtenberg, and television producer Joan Winston. In the author's notes for The Fate of the Phoenix (1979), Culbreath and Marshak announced a fictional travel guide to the planet Vulcan, Mr. Spock's Guide to the Planet Vulcan, and a non-Star Trek science fiction novel with William Shatner, The Power, were forthcoming. Other planned releases included new installments of The New Voyages series. None of the announced titles were realized or released. The Phonics Game, published by A Better Way Learning, and PhonicsOpoly, sometimes called PhonOpoly, published by LearnByGames, were created by Culbreath. Marshak also contributed content, and participated in sales and promotion to school teachers. On an episode of the \\"Future Talk\\" podcast hosted by Zoh Hieronimus, Culbreath was introduced as a well-known television and radio host, but no hosting details were given. Culbreath explained she had frequently \\"substituted for a nationally syndicated radio host,\\" but did not mention for whom. Other than an interview published in Voyages of Imagination (2006), and her appearances on \\"Future Talk\\" (2004), Culbreath has not given any new interviews. She has not produced any new fiction under her name since the release of Triangle. == Bibliography ==  Non-fiction  * The Star Trek Puzzle Manual (), with Jeff Razzi and Sondra Marshak.

It was released as a single by Pony Canyon on September 6, 2006. It served as the theme song to the tanpatsu dramas aired from July through September 2006 on AX's Drama Complex time slot. ==Background and composition== \\"ClƒÅvis (Kagi)\\" was written by Miyuki Nakajima and arranged by Ichiz≈ç Seo. It marks Kudo's first collaboration with Nakajima in eight years, since \\"Setsu Getsu Ka\\". The title \\"ClƒÅvis\\" is latin for \\"key\\". Nakajima wrote the song with Kudo in mind. She thought a song with latin influences should be sung by someone with a strong gaze, such as Kudo. Lyrically, the song deals with the theme of self- realization and explores the social nature of people. Nakajima writes about a protagonist \\"braving seas and people alike\\" in quest for the \\"keys of life\\", which she concludes is an puzzling endeavor. The song is composed in the key of C minor and set to a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span one octave, from B3 to B4. ==Critical reception== The latin-inspired track was praised for Kudo's ringing vocals and Nakajima's strong storytelling skills; their collaboration was deemed \\"miraculous\\". Kudo was praised as a three- dimensional, versatile vocalist; the single's B-side was described by critics as equally as well-executed as the main track, in spite of being in a completely different thematic register from \\"ClƒÅvis\\". ==Cover version== In 2006, Nakajima recorded a cover of the song for her album, Lullaby Singer. ==Chart performance== \\"ClƒÅvis\\" debuted at number 67 on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 2,000 copies in its first week, and charted for three weeks. ==Track listingCharts== center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2006) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position !scope=\\"col\\" Sales - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)  center;\\"67  left;\\"4,000 } ==References== Category:2006 songs Category:2006 singles Category:Japanese television drama theme songs Category:Television theme songs Category:Songs written by Miyuki Nakajima Category:Shizuka Kudo songs Category:Miyuki Nakajima songs Category:Pony Canyon singles ","title":"ClƒÅvis (Kagi)"},{"id":"56121448","text":"Omar B.

At least 500 foreign women are reportedly working in prostitution throughout the islands. Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Cura√ßao are sex tourism destinations. There is a single state-sanctioned brothel on each of the islands of Bonaire, Cura√ßao, and Sint Maarten. Cura√ßao, Aruba, and Sint Maarten are destination islands for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, In 2011, a human trafficking ring was broken up after trafficking women for sex exploitation from Colombia to Aruba, Cura√ßao, Sint Maarten, and Bonaire. ==Aruba== Prostitution in Aruba started to expand when oil refineries were opened on the island in the 1920s. Many prostitutes migrated to the island to service the oil workers and sailors from the oil tankers. In 1928, the Government set up a regulated area of prostitution (red- light district) in the oil refining town of Sint Nicolaas. Unlike the neighbouring island of Cura√ßao, The government was prevented from opening a state-run brothel by opposition from the Catholic Church and local women's groups. Regulations started during the 1950s allowed women to work for up to 3 months as \\"nightclub hostesses\\" in the bars and clubs of Sint Nicolaas' red- light district. Women from Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Panama and the Dominican Republic came to the island to work in the clubs and bars. Currently, regulated prostitution is limited to one zone in Sint Nicolaas. There are women of various nationalities working here, especially Colombian and Venezuelan. The prostitutes working in this area require an \\"adult entertainer\\" work permit that lasts 3 months. They have to have a medical examination before starting and then weekly check-up thereafter. The woman have individual rooms over the bars that they work from. Off-duty policemen sometimes work as security at the bars. There is also unregulated prostitution in bars outside the permitted zone. Street prostitution, although illegal, also occurs on the island. There is also evidence of prostitution in the more rural areas, often by women originally from the Dominican Republic. There are also escorts on the island advertising on the Internet and newspapers aimed at tourists. They operate outside the government's regulations, so are not required to have regular health checks or permits. Sex trafficking, especially of Venezuelan women, is a problem on the island. ==Bonaire== Bonaire permits a single brothel, For 40 years this was the \\"Pachi\\". in 2013, the owner was arrested following allegations of human trafficking and the brothel shut. The \\"Men's Heaven\\", operating in the Hamlet hotel, has applied for the permit. ==Cura√ßao== Prostitution has been known to exist in Cura√ßao since pirates and privateers used the island in the 17th century. In the 1920s, oil refineries were opened on the island. Women migrated to the island to service the needs of the oil workers and sailors from the tankers. In the 1930s and 1940s, Venezuelan, Colombian, and Dominican prostitutes operated in the town centre. The arrival of the Dutch and American navies to guard the island in the 1940s increased the demand for prostitutes. The government banned prostitution from the town centre, but this was unenforceable. The governor appointed a commission that included the police, the public health department and the clergy with a view to solving the prostitution problem. They concluded that the best alternative was to concentrate prostitution in one location away from the town centre, The plan was for a complex of appeasements where prostitutes could work independently. On 30 May 1949, the complex named Campo Alegre (also called Le Mirage) was opened. The brothel is still open and is the largest brothel in the Caribbean. Only foreign prostitutes are allowed to work there, regular health checks are carried out and the women have to carry a health certificate (\\"pink card\\"). Some prostitution occurs in other bars on the island and in small unlicensed brothels. Open-air \\"snacks\\", where drinks and fast food are served are also places prostitutes attract clients. Sex trafficking is a problem on the island. Cura√ßao is a transit and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Vulnerable populations include foreign and Cura√ßaoan women and girls in unregulated prostitution. Due to the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, legal and illegal migration to Cura√ßao increased, leaving many vulnerable to trafficking, including women working illegally at bars and brothels. ==Saba== Due to its low population (1,991 in 2013), there are no reports of permanent prostitution on the island. It was reported in 2013 that \\"dancers\\" were coming to the island at weekends and engaging in prostitution. ==Sint Eustatius== It has been reported that one or possibly two brothels exist on St Eustatia. ==Sint Maarten== Sint Maarten has the second largest brothel in the area, the \\"Seamans Club\\". It was set up in the 1960s to service the needs of the fishermen in the newly created fishing industry. As the bulk of these fishermen are Japanese, it is known locally as the \\"Japanese Club\\". Prostitution also occurs in nightclubs and hotels. Dancers in lap dancing and striptease establishments sometimes offer sexual services as a sideline. There are also a number of illegal small brothels on the island. Generally, prostitution is accepted in Sint Maarten and seen as a necessary part of the tourism industry. Sex trafficking is a problem on the island. Sint Maarten is a transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls from Latin America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Russia are the most vulnerable to sex trafficking, including women working in regulated and unregulated brothels and dance clubs. Some foreign women in St. Maarten's commercial sex industry are subjected to debt bondage. ==References== ","title":"Prostitution in the Dutch Caribbean"},{"id":"56121463","text":"Healthcare in Hertfordshire is now the responsibility of Herts Valleys, East and North Hertfordshire clinical commissioning groups. ==History== From 1947 to 1965 NHS services in Hertfordshire were managed by the North-West Metropolitan, East Anglian and North-East Metropolitan regional hospital boards. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. Hertfordshire came under the North West Metropolitan RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Hertfordshire came under the North West Thames Regional Health Authority. Hertfordshire was one of the area health authorities, subdivided into four district health authorities: North, East, South West and South West. In 1993 the county was divided into three health authorities: East and North Hertfordshire; North West Hertfordshire; South West Hertfordshire. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. Hertfordshire was under Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Hertfordshire came under NHS East of England until that was abolished in 2013. There was one primary care trust for the area. ==Commissioning== In October 2017 the two CCGs decided that obese patients ‚Äúwill not get non‚Äêurgent surgery until they reduce their weight‚Äù unless there are ‚Äúexceptional circumstances‚Äù and Smokers would not be referred for non-urgent surgery ‚Äúunless they have stopped smoking for eight weeks or more‚Äù. They also decided to reduce funding for In vitro fertilisation from three cycles to one for patients who meet the criteria; that female sterilisation will only be funded in exceptional circumstances; that gluten-free food will not be available on prescription for most patients who need it; and that over the counter medicines will no longer be prescribed except in exceptional circumstances. Herts Valleys needs to save ¬£45 million in 2017-18 to break even. East and North Hertfordshire needs to save ¬£23 million. ==Sustainability and transformation plan== The plan for the county includes both Hertfordshire and West Essex. It claims that the use of the hospital sector will be reduced and the use of community and primary care sector increased. There is no clear account of how the problems with local hospitals are to be tackled. Paul Burstow was appointed to chair the partnership in November 2018. ==Primary and community care== Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust ==Acute care== The main providers of NHS acute hospital care in the county are West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust and East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust. Ambulance services are provided by East of England Ambulance Service. There has been longstanding criticism of hospital facilities in the area. In 2019 West Herts 21st Century Hospital Solution, a local campaign group engaged BDP Healthcare to produce plans for a new acute general hospital in West Hertfordshire. They say this would be ‚Äúfinancially feasible and far preferable to existing plans to carry out piecemeal repairs‚Äù, but NHS managers say this option vastly exceeds the funding threshold, and they propose to apply for ¬£350 million of central government funding for ‚Äúsignificant investment‚Äù at Watford General Hospital, upgrades to surgery facilities at St Albans City Hospital and the consolidation of Hemel Hempstead Hospital. ==Mental health== NHS Mental Health services are provided by Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust. ==See also== *:Category:Health in Hertfordshire *Healthcare in the United Kingdom ==References== Hertfordshire ","title":"Healthcare in Hertfordshire"},{"id":"56121482","text":"The South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-160-056 was a historic Pratt through truss bridge in rural Turner County, South Dakota, carrying 476th Avenue across the East Fork Vermillion River northeast of Parker.

It was replaced by a modern steel beam bridge in about 2007. ==Description and history== The South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-160-045 was located in northeastern Turner County, about east of Parker and north. It was a single-span Pratt through truss structure, carrying 476th Avenue across the East Branch of the Vermilion River. The trusses rested on rubblestone abutments, with concrete tops that had shorted right-angled wings. The trusses spanned , and consisted of steel members assembled with pin connections. Rolled I-beams riveted to the trusses by means of hanger plates provide support for stringers and bridge decking. The bridge was built in 1905 by the J.A. Crane Company of Centerville, South Dakota. It was one of only two bridges known to be built by that company, both of which were located in Turner County. Crane bid on and built bridges in both Turner and Clay Counties, but is otherwise poorly documented. Locally manufactured metal truss bridges were relatively rare at the time, because bridge construction was dominated by out-of-state firms. Sometime between 2004 and 2007 the bridge, which was in deteriorating condition, was replaced by a modern steel girder bridge. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Turner County, South Dakota *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in South Dakota ==References== Category:Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in South Dakota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Turner County, South Dakota Category:Bridges completed in 1905 Category:Transportation in Turner County, South Dakota Category:Buildings and structures in Turner County, South Dakota Category:1905 establishments in South Dakota ","title":"South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-160-056"},{"id":"56121491","text":"Mark John Pollard (born 13 October 1979) is a Falkland Island politician who has served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Stanley constituency since the 2017 general election.

The first Europeans to discover the bay were Portuguese navigators led by Ant√≥nio de Campo in 1502. In 1544, the Portuguese merchant and explorer Louren√ßo Marques reached the bay and named it Delagoa Bay. The Portuguese established a fort on the site, but were soon forced to abandon it. In 1721, the Dutch East India Company established Fort Lydsaamheid on the bay, but abandoned it due to conflicts with local Africans and the unhealthy environment. In the mid-18th century, the Portuguese returned to the bay, selling ivory to British ships carrying Indian textiles. In 1773, William Bolts of the Trieste Company reached the bay and claimed it for the Holy Roman Empire. Bolts and the Austrians were forced out in 1781 by Portuguese ships sent from Goa. That year, hoping to prevent other European powers from claiming the area in the future, the Portuguese constructed a fortress on the bay, naming it Louren√ßo Marques. During the late 18th and early 19th century, the fort was mainly used by French, British, and American whaling ships to stop for provisions. A town grew around the fort starting around 1850, and in 1877, it was elevated to city status. In 1898, the colony of Portuguese Mozambique relocated its capital there. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Louren√ßo Marques grew both in population and economic development as a port city. Upon Mozambican independence in 1975, the city became the national capital and was renamed Maputo. During the Mozambican Civil War, the city's economy was devastated. When the war ended, the FRELIMO government launched a program to revive the city's economy, and to clean up the city by forcibly removing criminals, squatters, and undocumented residents. Since then, Maputo's economy, centered around its port, has recovered, and stability has returned. == European exploration and settlement, 1500‚Äì1820 ==  First inhabitants and Portuguese exploration  The first inhabitants of the region surrounding what is now known as Maputo Bay were likely Khoisan peoples. Around 700 years ago, Ronga-speaking Bantus migrated from the north and settled around the area.Fernandes, Jorge Lu√≠s P. ‚Äì Rep√∫blica de Mo√ßambique.

Em ‚ÄúA Filatelia Portuguesa‚Äù acessado a 25 de maio de 2009 By the 1500s, the site that Maputo now occupies had developed into a small fishing village. The first Europeans to reach the bay were Portuguese seamen under the command of Ant√≥nio de Campo, one of Vasco da Gama's captains, in 1502. In 1544, the Portuguese merchant trader and explorer Louren√ßo Marques, along with Ant√≥nio Caldeira, was sent by the Governor of Mozambique Island on a voyage of exploration. Marques visited the bay, and navigated the upper reaches of the estuaries feeding into it. Marques named the bay Ba√≠a da Lagoa (Portuguese: \\"Bay of the Lagoon\\"), which was anglicized to Delagoa Bay.Sopa, A. e B. Rungo. 2006. Maputo ‚Äì Roteiro Historico Iconogr√°fico da Cidade. Centro de Estudos Brasileiros da Embaixada do Brasil, Maputo.. King John III of Portugal declared the bay Ba√≠a de Louren√ßo Marques in his honor, but this name was never used commonly outside of Portugal. In the late 16th century or 17th century, the Portuguese established La Goa, a fort and trading post, on the site. The fort, manned by a single Catholic friar and several merchants, was a small-scale but profitable enterprise. However, ultimately the multitudes of mosquitos that swarmed the area forced the Portuguese to abandon the fort.  Dutch fort, 1720s  Plan of Fort Lydsaamheid, built by the Dutch East India Company in 1720. On 29 March 1720, three Dutch ships, the Kaap, the Gouda, and the Zeelandia, reached the bay. The Dutch navigators, led by Johannes Steffler, were warmly welcomed by the local Batonga tribe and its chief, Mafumbo. In March 1721, the Dutch East India Company purchased the land around the bay from Mafumbo and set about reconstructing the old Portuguese fort, which had fallen into ruin. The repaired fort was named Fort Lydsaamheid (Dutch: \\"Fort Endurance\\"). Within three weeks of their arrival 100 of the original sailors, craftsmen, and soldiers had died of fever. In August 1720, 80 new arrivals came to replace them. Beginning in April 1721, it was governed by an opperhoofd as a dependency of the Dutch Cape Colony. From April to 28 August 1722, when the Dutch recaptured it, the fort was occupied by pirates led by John Taylor. Fort Lydsaamheid's trade mainly centered around the trade of ivory, and to a lesser extent, slaves, tin, aloes, gold dust, ambergris, honey, copper, and rice. During the fort's nine years of operation, it exported 22,500 kg (49,574 lb) of ivory, and 288 slaves. The slave trade, while at its global peak, was minimal, because Dutch slave traders preferred to go to northern ports, where slaves could be more easily obtained, instead of Lydsaamheid, which was not equipped to handle large quantities. The settlers at the fort tried to farm, but all attempts ended in failure. In addition to trading, the fort was used as the starting point for several expeditions into the Mozambican interior in search of reputed gold mines in Monomatapa, which the Dutch believed was the gold-producing region mentioned as Ophir in the Bible. The first such expedition, led by Steffler, was forced to turn back after they were attacked by natives in the Lebombo Mountains. Another expedition, this time led by Johannes Monna in the late 1720s, set forth with native guides, but after failed trading attempts and a skirmish with a tribe armed with spears, also turned back. They returned to find Fort Lydsaamheid in a state of disorder following the discovery of a mutiny plot. The 62 would-be mutineers, who were disgruntled with the fort's terrible conditions, were arrested, tortured, and killed after their plans were discovered. Of the 62, 22 had been beaten with iron bars and their heads severed, others suffocated and beheaded, and the remainder simply hanged. In addition, in 1728, 28 Dutch soldiers abandoned Lydsaamheid and trekked to Inhambane, where the eighteen who survived the journey told the Portuguese there of the mistreatment and diseases they had experienced at the fort. Throughout its existence, Fort Lydsaamheid suffered from meager trade, an unhealthy environment, and general discord, and had failed to find the fabled gold-producing region. In 1729, Cape Colony officials received orders from Heeren XVII, the Dutch East India Company's board of directors, to abandon the fort. Instead of immediately implementing these orders, the colony offered a one-year grace period to the fort's personnel. However, during this period, the fort's men, under the leadership of Jan van de Capelle, attacked Chief Mafumbo, whose tribe had settled too close for comfort. In a battle that followed, several local chiefs attacked, killing all the Dutch soldiers except for one slave. In response, Capelle wrote to Cape Colony officials, requesting reinforcements to deal with the \\"hostile natives.\\" This series of events angered Cape Town leaders, as the men of Fort Lydsaamheid were involving themselves in conflicts when they were supposed to be preparing to leave. In addition, colony officials lambasted the men for their \\"lazy\\" lifestyle, often spending the days fishing instead of surveying the region. In April 1730, Cape Colony leaders resolved to evacuate the remaining men from the fort and bring them to Cape Town. On 27 December 1730, the last 133 Dutchmen boarded the Snuffelaar, arriving in Cape Town in January 1731. Before leaving, they stripped the fort of every remaining item, and demolished the palisade so that no other European power could seize it. Within three years of abandonment, the fort was an overgrown ruin, with only a few walls remaining standing.  Revival of trade, 1730s‚Äì1770s  The 1730s and 40s saw decreased commercial activities in and around Delagoa Bay. A Dutch ship, the Brack, which stopped in the bay in 1742 while on a voyage to Madagascar, reported that the area was mostly deserted, with a small number of natives (who were still able to communicate in Dutch). They also encountered a few remaining merchants, selling a small number of slaves, but no ivory. The revival of trade in Delagoa Bay came with expanding British trade with India. Since the abandonment of the Dutch fort, the Portuguese had intermittently maintained trading posts in the Esp√≠ritu Santo estuary within the bay. Initially, beads, arms, and arraco (a coconut product) were shipped from Madras to Mozambique Island, where Dutch merchant vessels would pick them up and bring them to Delagoa Bay. Still, trade grew slowly and remained risky, in part because of hostility of Portuguese officials towards British merchant ships. Despite the captain of Inhambane having urged the reestablishment of Portuguese authority in the bay since 1745, the Crown only did so in 1755 with sending the barque Francisco Xavier. The purpose, in addition to hopes of using the region to \\"provide slaves for Brazil\\", was to prevent any possible British attempts to colonize Delagoa Bay. In addition, as trade was just picking up, the Portuguese saw an opportunity to draw high prices for its Deccan cotton fabrics in exchange for ivory. Unexpectedly, a Bombay trading vessel, the British Salamander Bombketch, showed up as well, ruining Portugal's market opportunity. The Xavier, unable to sell its expensive textiles, left the bay, and ran aground on the way to Quelimane. During the 1750s and 60s, the British dominated trade in Delagoa Bay.  Austrian colonization, 1770s  Neither the British nor the Portuguese were willing to go forward with the risky venture of constructing a fort in Delagoa Bay. Nevertheless, the Portuguese sent a new ship to Delagoa in 1762. The goal was to establish a small trading post, and to either sign treaties with or purchase the surrounding land from the Kingdom of Tembi in order to keep the British out. The Portuguese constructed a mud structure on the bay, with a captain and 50 soldiers. But like the Dutch before them, disease forced them to abandoned the post after four years. Only the muzambazes, Portuguese-owned trading slaves, remained, with a reputation for robbing visitors. With the lapse of Portuguese presence in the bay, Dutch/English merchant William Bolts saw an opportunity. Bolts, who had a ten-year charter authorizing him to trade under the colors of the Holy Roman Empire,\\"Octroi de Sa Majest√© l'Imperatrice Reine Apostolique, accord√© au Sieur Guillaume Bolts, √† Vienne le 5 Juin 1775\\", Guillaume Bolts, Recueil de pi√®ces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Soci√©t√© imp√©riale asiatique de Trieste, g√©r√©es √† Anvers, Antwerp, 1787, pp.45‚Äì49. arrived at Delagoa Bay in 1773, aiming to establish a trading house as a base for trade between East Africa and ports on the west coast of India.√ñsterreichisches Staatsarchiv, Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv (HHStA), Ostindische Compagnie (OIC), iv; cited in Sven H.

The Trieste Company maintained the forts for four years, when modest commercial profits forced them to return to solely onboard trading. By 1780, trade had grown significantly: ships from Bombay, Surat, and Madras frequently arrived with Gujarati textiles and left the bay with ivory, usually stopping in Madagascar to purchase slaves before returning to India. In April 1781, Portugal, alarmed at the encroachment on their claimed territory, sent five ships, including a 40-gun frigate, and 500 men, from Goa to force the Austrians out. The Portuguese took any remaining Trieste Company people as prisoners, seized their two anchored ships, and demolished their buildings.  Reassertion of Portuguese control, 1780s‚Äì1810s  In order to prevent future intrusions, the Portuguese immediately established a garrison and recommenced trade at Delagoa Bay. The new fort was called Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora da Conceicao (Portuguese: \\"Fort of Our Lady of the Conception\\"). The Portuguese settlement was commonly called Louren√ßo Marques, after the explorer. Initially, the port's commercial success was scanty. In 1790, they sold 4,000 pieces of Indian textiles, a meager increase from the 3,000 that were sold 70 years earlier in 1720. While Indian cloth was not selling very well, there was increased demand for European textiles (20,000 sold in 1790), and to a lesser extent, beads and coral. In addition, shipments sent down the Maputo River brought ivory, rhinoceros horns, hippopotamus teeth, amber, gold, copper, agricultural products, and a small number of slaves. Although by the turn of the 19th century they were turning some profit through the sale of ivory, the Portuguese' main purpose for maintaining the fort was to prevent the Austrians or the British from reasserting themselves in the bay. If it were not for the Portuguese Crown's insistence on maintaining the fort, the colonial government on Mozambique Island would likely have abandoned the struggling settlement. The Portuguese briefly abandoned Louren√ßo Marques after a French attack in 1796, returning in 1799. In 1801, the small Portuguese garrison was unable to prevent an English ship from trading in Delagoa Bay. Though there is limited documentation of this period, it is thought that very little trade was carried out in the bay during the first two decades of the 19th century. The next British ship to enter the bay was 14 years later in 1815, by which point the Portuguese were able to successfully turn them away. Much of the economic activity that remained in this period consisted of visits by whaling ships stopping for provisions. French and British whaling ships had been stopping at the port since 1789, and while French ships were no longer welcome after having attacked the fort, British and American whaling vessels continued to resupply at the bay through the early 19th century. By 1817, the Portuguese planned to use the port to enter the whaling industry. That year, their first attempt to establish a whaling company in Delagoa Bay failed when their representative alienated a local Tembe chief by neglected to ask permission to use the tribe's land. The chief ended up killing the Portuguese men involved. With the second attempt in 1818, the whaling company was established, with black harpooners and specialized equipment brought in from North America. By this period, the slave trade in Mozambique was found up north, and in Delagoa Bay it was nearly nonexistent, perhaps being a factor in the Portuguese search for other ventures like whaling. By the 1820s, the slave trade had grown in Delagoa Bay, but was still small compared to the north. == Portuguese colonization and territorial disputes, 1820‚Äì1900 ==  British claims and African upheaval, 1820s  Beginning in 1821, Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen was sent by the British to survey the East African coast. Upon visiting Delagoa Bay, Owen wrote to his superiors that the Portuguese fort there was still so isolated as to sometimes experience food shortages. Eager for incriminating evidence that could provide Britain an excuse to take the region from Portugal, he wrote that Louren√ßo Marques had the potential to become a major participant in the slave trade. The fact that he cited the port's potential to trade slaves, rather than any actual trading, is indicative that the slave trade in Delagoa Bay was still very modest at that time. Owen, upon finding that the Kingdom of Tembi, located on the bay, south of Louren√ßo Marques, was still unclaimed by a European colonial power, set to claim it for the United Kingdom. In March 1823, he reached an agreement with King Kapell, who ceded his kingdom to the British, saying: > \\"I, King Kepal [Kapell] do declare that I am induced to make this cession by > the advice of my chiefs because I find my state too weak to defend > themselves against the aggression of either Africans or Europeans.\\" Owen claimed for Britain the land south of the English River (today known as the Esp√≠ritu Santo estuary). However, when he visited the bay again in 1824, he found that the Portuguese, disregarding the British treaty, had reached their own treaties with the African natives, and they endeavored (unsuccessfully) to take military possession of the country. Owen was able to take back control of the territory, but it remained disputed. Although the Union Jack flew over the area, the United Kingdom had taken no steps to exercise authority over the territory, while the ravages of Zulus confined the Portuguese to the limits of their fort. The Vatwas, a Nguni-speaking Zulu tribe, had recently migrated to the area, raiding the local villages for food and laying waste to the bay region, with the exception of the southern part. After two years without rain, drought was already causing famine, and compounded by the devastating attacks of the Vatwas, the local African population at the time was suffering from social upheaval. The decade-long turbulence was exacerbated by the social effects of increased slave trading during the late 1820s. Some stability was restored by the 1830s, when the effects of the drought had passed and slave trading declined. By 1829, Louren√ßo Marques still consisted of a small, fortified trading post, known to locals as Xilungu√≠ne (\\"Site of Whites\\"). Prior to 1826, the French, British, and American ships entering the bay traded either with the Portuguese port, or directly with African traders and tribal chiefs. Trade became more regulated in 1826, when a trading company was granted a monopoly over the ivory trade in the bay, allowing only them to purchase directly from African traders, and negatively effecting commerce in Louren√ßo Marques. The population of the fort at the time was just a few hundred, and consisted of three main groups: government personnel, including soldiers, civil servants, and their servants and slaves, Portuguese East India Company officials and slaves, and 300‚Äì400 Africans living within the fort's borders.  Zulu conflict, 1830s  Zulu King Dingane attacked Louren√ßo Marques in 1833 In 1833, for reasons that are not entirely clear, Zulu King Dingane kaSenzangakhona attacked Louren√ßo Marques. On 26 July 1833, Dingane and his army, accompanied by auxiliaries from two other tribes, arrived in front of the fort and burned nearby native villages. Anticipating an attack, the governor of Louren√ßo Marques, Dion√≠sio Ant√≥nio Ribeiro, along with much of the fort's personnel, left to take refuge on Xefina Island, ten miles east of the fort. Some soldiers remained at the fort, along with the head of the trading company, who disagreed with the decision to leave. On 17 September 1833, Dingane's army sacked the fort, but not the trading facilities. Nobre, the trading company head, had convinced the Portuguese soldiers not to resist the Zulus. Nobre made an arrangement with the Zulus and emerged safe from the conflict. On 16 September, Dingane ordered his men to pursue and kill Governor Ribeiro. When Zulu warriors arrived on the mainland across from Xefina Island on 6 October, Ribeiro took a boat, planning to stop at Magaia and then go meet the Ndwandwe leader Soshangane, an ally whom he had invited to attack the Zulus. However, before reaching his destination, the ship had to stop on the coast due to stormy weather. There, Ribeiro was captured by the Zulu, who killed three of his men and took him back to Louren√ßo Marques, where he was executed on 12 October 1833. Before his execution, a Zulu reportedly gave a public speech, and said: > \\"The governor will die because of his treachery and tyranny‚Äîfor having > usurped the land of the King Dingan [sic] and Machacana, made war on him > without motive, sent his people to [the Island of] Mo√ßambique, ... having > had flags hoisted in the lands of those kings without their consent under > the force of arms, [and] sent powder and ball to King Dingan.\\" While the explicitly stated motivations for the Zulu invasion of Louren√ßo Marques and the execution of Ribeiro were the governor's land expansion into Zulu territory, there may have been other reasons unstated in the speech. The commercial downturn accompanying the decline of the slave trade by 1830 effected the Zulu, who may have instead perceived the economic hardship as resulting from Portuguese greed. In addition, Ribeiro's lack of caution in his interactions with the volatile Dingane, who often switched from fighting with or against the Portuguese in the periodic conflicts with other tribes, and the governor's amicable relations with Soshangane, an enemy of the Zulu, were likely contributing factors. Following Ribeiro's death, Nobre, the trader, took over as acting governor. On 21 August 1834, Ribeiro's successor, Dario Rodrigues de Vasconellos, arrived at Louren√ßo Marques. Two days later, a Zulu representative of Dingane arrived to ask for tribute. By the mid-1830s, the Zulu Kingdom controlled much of the area to the west and south of Delagoa Bay, while Soshangane's Gaza Empire controlled much of the area to the north of Louren√ßo Marques. In 1835 a group of Boers led by a man named Orich traveled from the Transvaal and attempted to form a settlement on the bay. However, their population was decimated by fever and they soon abandoned the settlement.  British and Boer disputes, 1860s‚Äì1870s  In the 1860s, both the British and Boers made short-lived claims to territory around Deleagoa Bay. On 5 November 1861, Royal Navy Captain Bickford, of the frigate HMS Narcissus, occupied Inhaca Island and Elephant Island, and declared them British territory. Portugal protested this act, and in 1872 the dispute was submitted to the arbitration of Adolphe Thiers, the President of France. Thiers' successor, Patrice de MacMahon, on 24 July 1875 ruled in favor of Portugal, restoring their right to all lands south of Delagoa Bay. Previously, the United Kingdom and Portugal had agreed that a right of pre-emption would be granted to the unsuccessful claimant in case of sale or cession of the bay. Portuguese authority over the Mozambican interior was not established until some time after the MacMahon decision; nominally, the country south of the Manhissa river was ceded to them by the Matshangana chief Umzila in 1861. In honor of the French president's decision, the plaza where the Maputo Railway Station would later be built was renamed Pra√ßa MacMahon (Portuguese: \\"MacMahon Square\\"). A few years before, in 1868, the President of the Republic of the Transvaal, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, claimed the territory on each side of the Maputo River down to the sea. In the following year, however, the Transvaal government acknowledged Portugal's sovereignty over the bay.  Development of the city, 1850s‚Äì1890s  Louren√ßo Marques port, 1896 In 1850, a small town was founded next to the fort. The town, like the fort, became known as Louren√ßo Marques. In 1871, the town was described as a poor place, with narrow streets, fairly good flat-roofed houses, grass huts, decayed forts, and a rusty cannon, enclosed by a recently erected wall high and protected by bastions at intervals. On 9 December 1876, Louren√ßo Marques was elevated to village status. The growing strength of the Transvaal led, to greater interest being taken back in Portugal in the development of a port. A commission was sent by the Portuguese government in 1876 to drain the marshy land near the settlement, to plant blue gum trees, and to build a hospital and a church. In 1885, the Vasco de Gama Gardens were laid out. On 10 November 1887, Louren√ßo Marques was declared a city by a royal decree by King Lu√≠s, who cited the settlement's material improvements and economic potential. The Witwatersrand Gold Rush, which began in 1886, further increased the economic development of the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as Louren√ßo Marques served as the closest seaport for the export of gold and diamonds from South Africa. In 1889, another dispute arose between Portugal and the United Kingdom over the Portuguese seizure of the railway running from the bay to the Transvaal. This dispute was also referred to arbitration: in 1900, Portugal was found liable and ordered to pay nearly ¬£1,000,000 in compensation to the railway company's shareholders. In 1892, a commercial newspaper, O Commercio de Louren√ßo Marques, began publication. In 1895, construction of a railroad to Pretoria, South Africa, caused the city's population to grow. In 1898, Louren√ßo Marques replaced the Island of Mozambique as the capital of Portuguese Mozambique. In 1891, a Portuguese politician, Ant√≥nio Jos√© Enes, succeeded J√∫lio de Vilhena as High Commissioner of Mozambique. He, based out of Louren√ßo Marques, resisted British attempts to enter the region, defeated powerful African rulers, and solidified Portuguese military control over southern Mozambique. Chief Mpfumu Nuamantibjane of the Magaia tribe, one of the greatest opponents of Portuguese colonial occupation of Delagoa Bay, was defeated by Enes. Along with Joaquim Augusto Mouzinho de Albuquerque, he organized an expedition to conquer the Gaza Empire, defeating them in 1895. == Urban growth and colonial rule, 1900‚Äì1975 == Louren√ßo Marques, 1905 Portuguese colonial-era residence In the early 20th century, with a well-equipped seaport, with piers, quays, landing sheds and electric cranes, enabling large vessels to discharge cargoes direct into the rail cars, Louren√ßo Marques developed under Portuguese rule into an economically important city. It was served by British, Portuguese, and German cargo liners, and the majority of its imported goods were shipped at Southampton, Lisbon, and Hamburg. In 1904, the year the city's tram network began operating, it had a population of 9,849. By 1912, the population had grown to 13,353. In 1916, the Central Railway Station was constructed. In 1934, the Historical Archive of Mozambique became headquartered in the city. Map of Louren√ßo Marques, 1929 During the early and mid-20th century, Louren√ßo Marques population grew quickly due to a lack of restriction on the internal migration of indigenous blacks, a situation that differed from the apartheid policies of neighboring South Africa. From a 1935 population of 47,390, the city's population nearly doubled to 93,516 by 1950. Although blacks were allowed to move to Louren√ßo Marques, colonial authorities did maintain a degree of separation. Only whites were allowed to live in the city center, where in the 1950s and 60s colonial authorities built many concrete high-rise buildings to house the expatriate Portuguese population. Meanwhile, most blacks had to live in undeveloped slums in outer sections of the city. Mafalala, one such slum, became the center of black resistance to colonial rule, housing many leaders of the Marxist FRELIMO movement. At the same time, the treatment of blacks in the city was more humane than in segregated South African cities like Johannesburg: in Louren√ßo Marques, businesses, churches, and schools were all non-segregated. Maputo City Hall, completed in 1947 With the continuous growth of the city's population and its expanding economy centered on the seaport, from the 1940s, Portugal's administration built a network of primary and secondary schools, industrial and commercial schools as well as the first university in the country ‚Äî the University of Louren√ßo Marques opened in 1962. Portuguese, Islamic (including Ismailis), Indian (including from Portuguese India) and Chinese (including Macanese) communities ‚Äî but not the unskilled African majority ‚Äî achieved great prosperity by developing the industrial and commercial sectors of the city. The first terminal of Louren√ßo Marques Airport was constructed in 1940, the Art Deco Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception was built four years later, and Maputo City Hall was completed in 1947. In 1962, the National Library of Mozambique was established, and in 1968, the Est√°dio Salazar inaugurated in Matola. Until the mid-1970s, thousands of Rhodesian and South African tourists frequented the city, drawn by its scenic beaches, high-quality hotels, restaurants, and lively entertainment scene, including casinos and brothels.\\"Louren√ßo Marques a cidade feiti√ßo\\" on YouTube, a film of Louren√ßo Marques, Portuguese Mozambique in 1970. With wide avenues lined by jacaranda and acacia trees, it earned the nicknames City of Acacias and the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. In 1970, Tempo, the first full-color magazine in the country, began publication as a voice of opposition to Portuguese colonial rule. In 1970, the city had a population of 383,775. == Independence, 1975‚Äìpresent ==  Lusaka Accord and aftermath  In April 1974, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal overthrew the Estado Novo regime, which had defied the European trend of granting independence to African colonies. On 4 August, the new Portuguese government pledged to grant independence to Mozambique soon. Later that day, a crowd of 30,000 gathered in Louren√ßo Marques to show support of the Portuguese government's decision. With the signing of the Lusaka Accord on 7 September 1974, the ten-year Mozambican War of Independence ended in a ceasefire and the transition to independence began. The day the Lusaka Accord was signed, a group of right-wing white dissidents, calling themselves the Movement for a Free Mozambique, challenged the independence deal by attempting to seize control of Louren√ßo Marques. The dissidents freed a former secret police officer from prison and occupied the city's post office, the airport's air traffic control tower, and the main radio station, taking women and children hostage. From the radio station, they broadcast demands for Portugal to grant Mozambique independence without handing over power to FRELIMO, so that the Movement for a Free Mozambique could set up a \\"multiracial\\" government. Police and Portuguese soldiers surrounded the occupied sites, but did not immediately remove the dissidents because they were keeping hostages. Just outside the city, two whites and one black person were killed when black counter-demonstrators stoned a vehicle being driven by dissidents at the airport. Portuguese authorities reported that no other areas of the country besides the capital saw any violence occur in reaction to the Lusaka Accord. In response to the white backlash, FRELIMO said they would \\"smash the rebellion\\" with the help of Portuguese troops. In Portugal, Prime Minister Vasco Gon√ßalves said the Portuguese Armed Forces were not seeking FRELIMO's help in restoring order, and said that he saw the events not as a coup d'√©tat, \\"but rather a desperate act by a minority which does not understand the historic processes and the ways of the future.\\" By the time the weeklong coup attempt had ended, homes and businesses had been looted, and 86 people were dead, including 27 whites. Shortly after the failed coup d'√©tat attempt, a transitional, black-majority government was installed, led by Joaquim Chissano as premier. In the two weeks that followed, 25,000 whites left Mozambique, about 10% of the white population. Many moved to South Africa, Portugal, or Rhodesia. In a statement published in the newspaper Noticias, Chissano tried to stem the white flight, telling those who were not responsible for the violence that they were welcome to return. In 1974, Alberto Massavanhane was appointed by the transitional government as the first black mayor of Louren√ßo Marques. During the transitional period, frequent strikes at the city's port were held in protest, which FRELIMO put down forcefully.  After independence  The Monument to the Great War, erected as a memorial to the Portuguese that died during World War I. On 25 June 1975, the People's Republic of Mozambique was proclaimed in accordance with the Lusaka Accord. In Louren√ßo Marques, independence was celebrated with a parade and state banquet. Dozens of statues of historical Portuguese figures, including those of Vasco da Gama and Louren√ßo Marques, were taken down. In addition, many of the city's institutions and streets, originally named for heroes or important dates in Portuguese history, had their names changed to African languages, revolutionary figures, or pre-colonial historic names. Many were named for socialist and anti-colonial leaders, including Kim Il-sung, Friedrich Engels, Julius Nyerere, Patrice Lumumba, and Robert Mugabe. White residents of Mozambique, a large portion of whom resided in the capital, were given a 90-day period to accept Mozambican citizenship and stay, or to leave the country. Most decided to leave: in April 1974 there were 220,000 whites, including 80,000 soldiers; but by July 1975, 55,000 civilians plus all the troops had left, leaving just 85,000 whites in the country. In Maputo specifically, white neighborhoods lost an average of one-third of their residents; some areas lost as many as half. Most of the whites who chose to leave were only allowed to take one suitcase each and $150 worth of escudos. As the white elites left, the city (and the country as a whole) suffered from human capital flight. At the port, efficiency declined 80% and pilferage doubled in the year after independence. In response, there was discussion of potentially sending armed troops to force improved efficiency, possibly at gunpoint. In 1975, it was expected that the city would soon be renamed Can Phumo, or \\"Place of Phumo\\", after a Shangaan chief who lived in the area before Louren√ßo Marques first visited the site in 1544. However, in a rally on the morning of 3 February 1976, President Samora Machel announced that city would be renamed Maputo, after the nearby Maputo River. The name \\"Maputo\\" was also significant in the anti-colonial struggle; a popular FRELIMO slogan went, \\"Viva Mo√ßambique unido, do Rovuma ao Maputo\\" (\\"Long live Mozambique, united from Rovuma to Maputo\\"). In 1976, nationalization of private businesses occurred in Maputo, and the following year, the Bank of Mozambique and the Mozambican Youth Organisation became headquartered in the city. In February 1977, Maputo hosted the African Conference on Cinema. In 1978, the city's C√¢mara Municipal (city council) form of government was replaced by the Conselho Executivo (executive council). In 1980, the city was granted provincial status, removing it from Maputo Province. Central Maputo Starting shortly after independence, the country was plagued by the Mozambican Civil War, a long and violent struggle between FRELIMO and RENAMO, which lasted from 1977 to 1992. The war adversely affected economic activity and political stability in the city. Tourism, once a boon to the economy, all but disappeared. \\"Operation Production\\" (Opera√ß√£o Produ√ß√£o) was inaugurated in 1983 by the ruling FRELIMO party to deal with the economic crisis. The city's so-described \\"parasitic\\" population, which included jobless and undocumented residents as well as criminals, were forcibly transferred to state-owned communal farms and villages in the rural north of Mozambique. By 1990, the city's population had reached 776,000. Since the peace agreement ending the civil war, which was signed in 1992, the country and the city has returned to its pre-independence levels of political stability. In 1996, the Maputo Development Corridor was launched, expanding Maputo's economic links with the Gauteng, Limpopo, and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. In 1997, the city had a population of 966,837. In 2000, the city, which by this point counted 1,096,00 residents, was struck by a massive flood. In July 2000, Maputo hosted the Community of Portuguese Language Countries summit. Today, the Maputo port has recovered and can now handle multiple ships at once. Maputo's economy today centers around the port, with other industries including brewing, shipbuilding and repair, fish canning, ironwork, and cement and textile manufacturing. == See also == * Timeline of Maputo == References == ","title":"History of Maputo"},{"id":"56121627","text":"U61000: the first 1-Mbit memory chip produced by the GDR Presenting the first 1Mb microchip to Erich Honecker, September 12, 1988 East Germany was one of the leading computer producers in the Eastern Bloc as purchases of higher technologies from the West were under various embargoes. A program of illegal purchases, copying and reverse engineering of Western examples was established, after which GDR sold these computers to COMECON countries. Under the rule of Erich Honecker electronics, microelectronics and data processing industries grew at average 11.4% in the 1970s and 12.9% during the 1980s. ==Structure in 1989== In the years just before German Reunification, the electronics industry was structured into business conglomerates called Kombinate (combine). Semiconductor manufacturing equipment was produced by Kombinat Carl Zeiss Jena. Using this equipment VEB Kombinat Elektronische Bauelemente Teltow manufactured passive electronic components and VEB Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt active electronic components. In turn, VEB Kombinat Robotron Dresden assembled these components into a range of computers. VEB Kombinat Rundfunk- und Fernsehtechnik Sta√üfurt produced consumer electronics such as radio receivers, cassette decks, and television sets while telecommunications equipment was provided by VEB Kombinat Nachrichtenelektronik Berlin. With the exception of Carl Zeiss and Robotron, most components and devices were sold under the common trademark RFT (from Rundfunk- und Fernmelde-Technik).[de] ==History== An East German semiconductor factory around 1989. From 1977 the attempt to achieve a competitive edge in microchips against the research and development resources of the entire western world ‚Äì in a state of just 16 million people ‚Äì was perhaps always doomed to failure, but swallowed increasing amounts of internal resources and hard currency. GDR was some five to eight years behind the leading producers of USA and Japan. To produce one 64kb chip cost 40 marks, while in the West it cost 4.50 marks. To produce one 256kb chip cost 534 marks, while in the West it cost 5.00 to 7.00 marks. Microelectronics industry in Eastern Germany began in 1961 when the \\"Arbeitsstelle f√ºr Molekularelektronik Dresden\\" (department of molecular electronics Dresden) was established in Dresden. Later it grew into \\"VEB Forschungszentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden\\". The center of East German microchip industry was in Dresden, where research and production laboratories were located. Production equipment was built by Carl Zeiss Jena and \\"VEB Elektromat Dresden\\". The actual 13 mm x 5 mm U61000 microchip production was done by \\"VEB Forschungszentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden\\" and it was presented publicly in September 1988. In total some 50,000 U61000 microchips were produced in early 1990 before the GDR dissolved together with its microchip industry. During the cold war 3,500 people were employed in this microelectronics center. After reunification Dresden formed the nucleus for the modern day largest unified german cluster in semiconductor technologies Silicon Saxony with 40,000 employees. ==See also== * History of computer hardware in Soviet Bloc countries ==References== East Germany Category:Economy of East Germany Category:Science and technology in East Germany ","title":"Electronics industry in East Germany"},{"id":"56121686","text":"Take Me All the Way is the eighth album by Stacy Lattisaw, released in 1986 on Motown Records.

As a two-year-old in 1994 he won a maiden race on his debut and then won the Group 1 National Stakes on his second and final start of the year. In the following year he won the Silver Stakes and was narrowly beaten in a strongly contested edition of the Irish Derby. As a four-year-old he added victories in the Mooresbridge Stakes and the Tattersalls Gold Cup. After being retired from racing at the end of the 1996 he became a successful breeding stallion, enjoying particular success as a sire of National Hunt horses. ==Background== Definite Article was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by Dr D Davis. In November 1992, the foal was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was sold for 16,000 guineas to the bloodstock agent Amanda Skiffington. As a yearling he returned to the sales ring at Tattersalls in October and was bought for 75,000 guineas by the Irish trainer Dermot Weld. He entered into the ownership of the Moyglare Stud and trained by Weld at the Curragh, County Kildare. He was ridden in all but one of his races by Mick Kinane. His sire Indian Ridge was a top-class sprinter whose wins included the King's Stand Stakes in 1989. He later became a very successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Ridgewood Pearl, Domedriver, Compton Place and Indian Ink. Indian Ridge was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Definite Article's dam Summer Fashion finished second on her only race as a juvenile, but went on to win six minor races from twenty-one starts over the next two seasons. As a broodmare she also produced the Dante Stakes winner Salford Express. She was a descendant of the British broodmare Indiscretion (foaled 1932),making her a distant relative of several major winners including Rakti, Bakharoff and Holding Court. ==Racing career== 1994: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut, Definite Article started the 4/6 favourite for a maiden race over eight and a half furlongs at Galway Races on 6 September and won by a length from Metastasio. Eleven days later the colt was dropped back in distance and moved up sharply in class to contest the Group 1 National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh and started the 4/1 second choice in the betting behind his stablemate Desert Style (third in the Phoenix Stakes). The other three runners were Manashar, Elegant Victor and Suga Hawk and with no previous Group race winners on show, the field appeared to be a substandard one. In a closely contested finish Definite Article prevailed by half a length from Manashar, with Desert Style and Elegant Victor close behind in third and fourth. 1995: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three- year-old, Definite Article was tried over ten furlongs in the Listed Silver Stakes at the Curragh on 27 May and started at odds of 4/1 in an eight-runner field. He won the race by two lengths from the odds-on favourite Shemaran (runner-up in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial), to whom he was conceding seven pounds in weight. In the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 2 July Definite Article attempted to defend his unbeaten record and started 5/1 joint second favourite behind Celtic Swing. After being restrained by Kinane in the early stages he produced a sustained run on the outside in the straight to take the lead a furlong out but was caught on the line by the rally of the French-trained Winged Love and was beaten a short head in a photo finish. Annus Mirabilis took third ahead of Oscar Schindler and Classic Cliche with Celtic Swing finishing eighth. Later in July the colt was sent to Germany and matched against older horses for the first time in the Group 1 Bayerisches Zuchtrennen over 2000 metres at Munich. He raced in third place for most of the way but was unable to quicken in the straight and finished fourth behind the filly Germany. Definite Article returned to Ireland for the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in September and started 6/1 third favourite behind Pentire and Hernando. He made steady progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home fourth behind Pentire, Freedom Cry and Flagbird, beaten two and a half lengths by the winner. 1996: four-year-old season Definite Article began his third campaign in the Listed Mooresbridge Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 27 April and started the 4/9 favourite against five opponents headed by the Glencairn Stakes winner Al Mohaajir. After being held up by Kinane in the early running he took the lead entering the last quarter mile and won by three-quarters of a length from Al Mohaajir, with I'm Supposin a length away in third. A Month later, over the same course and distance, the colt started 15/8 favourite for the Group 2 Tattersalls Gold Cup. His seven opponents on this occasion included Timarida, Annus Mirabilis, Al Mohaajir and River North (Aral-Pokal). He raced in third place before moving upon the outside to take the lead two furlongs from the finish. He stayed on well in the closing stages to beat Timarida by a length with a gap of three lengths back to Annus Mirabilis in third. In July Definite Article raced in England for the first time and started 7/2 third favourite for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park. He was among the early leaders but faded in the last quarter mile and finished fifth of the seven runners behind Halling. In the Grosser Preis von Baden on 1 September, on what proved to be his last race in Europe, the colt finished fourth behind Pilsudski, Germany and Sunshack. For his final race Definite Article was sent to the United States and came home sixth of the ten runners behind Diplomatic Jet in the Turf Classic Invitational Stakes at Belmont Park on 5 October. ==Stud record== Definite Article was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Ireland, spending much of his stud career at the Morristown Lattin Stud near Newbridge, County Kildare. By far the best of his progeny was the outstanding stayer Vinnie Roe, while the best of his other winners on the flat included Grammarian (San Gabriel Handicap), Solid Approach (AKA Supreme Rabbit, a Grade II winner in Hong Kong), Lochbuie (Geoffrey Freer Stakes) and La Vita E Bella (Montrose Stakes). He was also very successful as a National Hunt stallion, with his offspring including Red (Many Clouds Chase), The Real Article (WKD Hurdle), Black Jack Blues (Grand National Hurdle Stakes), Non So (Racing Post Plate), Cailin Annamh (Grabel Mares Hurdle), Greenhope (Grand Annual Chase), Thesis (Top Novices' Hurdle) and Pingshou (Top Novices' Hurdle). ==Pedigree== *Definite Article was inbred 3 √ó 3 to Lorenzaccio, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1992 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 22-d Category:Byerley Turk sire line ","title":"Definite Article (horse)"},{"id":"56121750","text":"GAQ may refer to: * Gao International Airport, in Mali * GŒ±q alpha subunit * Gta‚Äô language ","title":"GAQ"},{"id":"56121759","text":"Opinion polling was carried out prior to the 2017 Chilean general elections. ==President== Open-ended question Question: \\"Who would you like to be the next president?\\" Full sample is shown, unless specified. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font- size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" !

The election had originally been scheduled for 18 April, but was postponed due to sustained weekly protests against plans by the incumbent president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term.Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika drops bid for fifth term BBC News, 11 March 2019 Bouteflika resigned on 2 April and Abdelkader Bensalah was elected acting president by parliament a week later.Abdelkader Bensalah named Algeria's interim president France24, 9 April 2019 On 10 April the election was rescheduled for 4 July. On 2 June the Constitutional Council postponed the elections again, citing a lack of candidates. A new electoral authority, Autorit√© nationale ind√©pendante des √©lections (ANIE), was created in mid-September as an alternative to the existing (HIISE) defined by the 2016 constitution. The election was rescheduled for 12 December 2019 and ANIE, of disputed constitutional validity, announced five valid candidates on 2 November. In their strong protest on 1 November, Algerian protestors rejected the 12 December election and called for a radical change in the system to take place first. The Forces of the Democratic Alternative (FDA) alliance and the Justice and Development Front also called for boycotting the 12 December election, and the FDA called for creating a constituent assembly. ==Electoral system== The President of Algeria is elected using the two-round system; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round will be held.People's Democratic Republic of Algeria: Election for President IFES Electoral bodies The Algerian Constitution of 2016 created the (HIISE) to have overall responsibility for organising elections. For the third attempt to organise the 2019 presidential election, the Algerian lower and upper houses of parliament created the Autorit√© nationale ind√©pendante des √©lections (ANIE). Lawyer Fa√Øz Moussi and constitutional expert Ahmed Betatache described the procedures for creating ANIE as rushed and unconstitutional. Fouad Makhlouf, secretary-general of HIISE, had stated earlier, in April 2019, that the replacement of HIISE's role by an alternative electoral body would be unconstitutional. ==Background== Early 2019 protests and internet censorship Plans for a presidential election in Algeria in 2019 were a major factor motivating the start of the 2019 Algerian protests, with protestors objecting to the reelection of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. On 22 February 2019, protests took place in Algiers, Oran, S√©tif, Annaba and other Algerian cities over Bouteflika's bid to continue for a fifth term. Algerians reported difficulty accessing online services and the NetBlocks internet observatory published technical evidence of multiple targeted internet disruptions at demonstration flashpoints in Tizi Ouzou and around Algiers. ==Candidates== Bensalah is not eligible to participate in the presidential election. 18 April 2019 cancelled election On 3 March 2019, a day after his 82nd birthday and while undergoing medical tests in Switzerland, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika formally submitted his candidacy, but said in a statement read on state TV that he would not serve a full term if re-elected. Instead, he promised to organise a national conference and set a date for an early election which he would not participate in. The announcement followed weeks of protests against his plan to seek a fifth term in office. A week later, on 11 March 2019, Bouteflika withdrew from the race and postponed the election. On 1 November 2018, journalist announced that he would be a candidate in the election. On 4 April 2019, Ali Ghediri, a former Director of Human Resources at the Ministry of Defense, announced his candidacy. 4 July 2019 cancelled election The 4 July 2019 election had two candidates who applied: Abdelhakim Hamadi from Jijel, born 23 August 1965, who trained as a vet, worked in the state sector and became a businessman; and Hamid Touahri, an aeronautical mechanical engineer who worked in medical sales and construction and managed an audiovisual production firm. Both candidates' applications were lodged on 25 May, and later rejected by the Constitutional Council, which cancelled the election due to what it called the \\"impossibility\\" of organising the election. 12 December 2019 election Potential candidates Ahmed Gaid Salah and Noureddine Bedoui won't run. Former prime minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem was expected to be a candidate. The Tajamou Amel El-Djaza√Ør former minister Amar Ghoul (in prison at the time) announced his participation in the vote. 145 people picked up their application forms, including: *Ali Benflis, former head of government; *Abdelaziz Belaid, president of the El Moustakbal Front; *Aissa Belhadi, president of the Front of Good Governance; *Abdelkader Bengrina, president of the El-Bina Movement; *Ali Zeghdoud, president of the Algerian Rally party; *Mourad Arroudj, president of Errafah; *Belkacem Sahli, president of the Republican National Alliance; *Abdelmadjid Tebboune, former Prime Minister; *Rabah Bencherif; *Azzedine Mihoubi, former Minister of Culture; *Rabah Bencherif; *Souleymen Bakhlili, journalist; *Ahmed Ben N√¢amane, writer; *Abderrahmane Arrar, coordinator of the Civil Force for Change. The five candidates announced by Mohamed Chorfi, head of the electoral authority, on 2 November 2019 are: * former prime minister under Bouteflika, Abdelmadjid Tebboune * former prime minister under Bouteflika, Ali Benflis * former culture minister Azzedine Mihoubi * former tourism minister Abdelkader Bengrina * head of the El Moustakbal Front, . Al Jazeera English described the five candidates as \\"all part of the political establishment\\", whose departure from power is one of the main aims of the 2019 Algerian protests. Thomson Reuters described the candidates as \\"men on the ballot [who] all have close links with the establishment, and though some of them pushed for reforms, many still see them as part of an entrenched, unchanging elite.\\" ==Boycott== Protestors In the weekly protests that continued the early 2019 protests that led to Bouteflika dropping his candidacy for the initially scheduled election and resigning from the presidency, twenty thousand protestors called for the 12 December election to be boycotted on the grounds that the system of people in power under Bouteflika remained in place. In the 1 November 2019 demonstration of two hundred thousand demonstrators, on the 37th Friday weekly protest, demonstrators called for all members of the system of power in place to be dismissed and for a radical change in the political system. They rejected the 12 December election, with slogans describing it as \\"an election with the gangs\\" and as an \\"election organised by a corrupt power [which] is a trap for idiots\\" (). Prominent individuals and organisations Former prime minister Ahmed Benbitour, former minister Abdelaziz Rahabi, Ali Fawzi Rebaine, Mohamed Said and Rachid Nekkaz, announced that they are not candidates because of the political climate. On 28 September, Abdallah Djaballah, president of the Justice and Development Front, announced that his party will not take part in the elections. This was followed by the Society for Peace Movement, which made a similar decision for the same reasons. The Forces of the Democratic Alternative, a coalition including the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), the Workers' Party (PT), the Socialist Workers Party (PST), the Union for Change and Progress (UCP), the Democratic and Social Movement (MDS), the Party for Secularism and Democracy (PLD) and the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH), announced their refusal to participate in the vote. Mayors In September, 56 mayors in Kabylie stated that they would refuse to organise the practical aspects of the 12 December election in their municipalities and would do everything in their power to prevent the election taking place. ==Timeline== Convocation and candidate validation *September 2019: Convocation of the electorate by the Acting Head of State *26 October 2019: Deadline for applications *2 November 2019: Validation and publication of the list of qualified candidates by ANIE *9 November 2019: Validation and publication of the list of candidates by the Constitutional Council Campaign The official campaign period is from 17 November 2019, the opening of the election campaign, to 8 December 2019, the final day on which campaigning is allowed. On 17 November, the day that the five candidates opened their campaigns, protestors objecting to the election, perceiving it as a continuation of the same group of people retaining political power, posted sacks of garbage on panels allocated for presidential candidates' campaign posters. Protestor Smain described the symbolism by stating that the election \\"is completely rejected ... as garbage\\". First round *12 December 2019: First round. ==Results== Preliminary results showed that former Prime Minister and Minister of Housing Abdelmadjid Tebboune won the election in the first round, leading his nearest opponent (Abdelkader Bengrina of the Islamist El Binaa party) by over 40% of the valid votes. The official estimate of the turnout of just under 40% of eligible voters was the lowest of any Algerian presidential election held since independence, primarily due to boycotts by citizens and political parties alike. The Rally for Culture and Democracy estimated the turnout five times lower, at 8%. The low turnout, as well as the relatively high number of spoiled ballots out of those who did participate, was seen as a continuation of the pro-democracy protests that preceded the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, as all approved candidates in the election were seen as members of the political establishment. ==References== Algeria Category:2019 in Algeria Category:2019‚Äì20 Algerian protests Category:December 2019 events in Africa Category:Presidential elections in Algeria ","title":"2019 Algerian presidential election"},{"id":"56121804","text":"Destination X (2015) (aka Impact Wrestling: Destination X) was a professional wrestling event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion, which took place on May 17, 2015 at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the eleventh event under the Destination X chronology. Like the previous year's event, this event was not held on pay-per-view (PPV) and was instead featured as a special edition of TNA's weekly broadcast of Impact Wrestling, which aired on June 10, 2015. Seven professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. Kurt Angle defended the World Heavyweight Championship twice at the event; first against Rockstar Spud in the opening match, who had earned the title shot by invoking Option C which required him to vacate the X Division Championship and secondly against Austin Aries in the main event, who had cashed in his Feast or Fired briefcase for the title match. Angle retained the title in both matches. On the undercard, three-way qualifiers took place with the winners qualifying for a three-way match for the vacant X Division Championship and Taryn Terrell defended the Knockouts Championship against Awesome Kong and Bram issued an open challenge for a No Holds Barred match, which was answered by Crimson. ==Production== Background Destination X was held by TNA as an X Division-exclusive event since the 2011 edition. Beginning with the 2012 edition, Destination X also became a staple for the X Division Champions to invoke Option C, which required them to vacate the title to earn a shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at the event. Storylines At Hardcore Justice, Kenny King defeated Rockstar Spud, Tiger Uno and Mandrews in a ladder match to win the X Division Championship. On the May 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Spud regained the X Division Championship from King in an X Division Gauntlet match. On the June 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, Spud invoked Option C, thus vacating the title in exchange for a World Heavyweight Championship match against Kurt Angle at Destination X. Later that night, Angle and Spud defeated Ethan Carter III and Tyrus in a tag team match. After the match, Austin Aries announced that he would be cashing in his Feast or Fired briefcase for the World Heavyweight Championship against the winner of Angle and Spud's title match at Destination X. The vacancy of X Division Championship resulted in three-way qualifying matches being announced for Destination X, with the winners of the match qualifying for a three-way match for the vacant X Division Championship at a later date. ==Event== Preliminary matches The event kicked off with a World Heavyweight Championship match between the defending champion Kurt Angle and challenger Rockstar Spud. However, Ethan Carter III protested before the match that he had earned the #1 contender status for the World Heavyweight Championship and was not getting his title shot but Spud and Austin Aries were getting title shots before him and refused to leave the ring until Angle threatened to snap his ankle forcing EC3 to retreat. As the match between Angle and Spud progressed, Spud nailed an Underdog on Angle but got a near-fall and then Spud tried to pick up Angle but Angle snapped his ankle and applied an ankle lock to force Spud to submit to retain the title. After the match, The Dollhouse cut a promo in which Dollhouse leader, the Knockouts Champion Taryn Terrell announced that if Awesome Kong wanted a title shot against her for the Knockouts Championship then it would be a Lingerie Pillow Fight otherwise Terrell would not give her a title shot. Next, the first three-way match in the X Division CHampionship tournament took place between Low Ki, Manik and Crazzy Steve. After knocking out Manik and Steve with a running dropkick, Ki nailed a Warrior's Way on Manik for the win. Next, the second three-way match in the X Division Championship tournament took place between Tigre Uno, DJ Z and Mandrews. DJ Z knocked out Mandrews with a That DDT Tho and climbed the top rope but Uno knocked DJ Z off the top rope and nailed a Sabertooth Splash to Mandrews for the win. After the match, Jessie Godderz attacked DJ Z by hitting him a clothesline, turnbuckle powerbomb and then hit a military press slam over the top rope onto the concrete. After the match, The Dollhouse (Taryn Terrell, Jade and Marti Bell) came out and called out Awesome Kong for the Lingerie Pillow Fight for the Knockouts Championship but Kong did not come out in a lingerie and then Jade and Bell tried to force her to wear the lingerie but Kong attacked both of them and Terrell demanded to be declared the winner until Brooke arrived and confronted and ripped off Terrell's robe. Later, the third three-way X Division Championship tournament match took place between Grado, Cruz and Kenny King. Grado knocked King out of the ring with a back body drop and then hit a Roll 'N Slice to Cruz for the win. This was followed by the penultimate match, in which Bram issued an open challenge to any past wrestler from TNA and then Crimson made his return to TNA by answering Bram's challenge. Crimson tried to apply a double underhook crossface on Bram but Bram bit his hand and delivered a Brighter Side of Suffering to Crimson for the win. Main event match In the main event, Kurt Angle defended the World Heavyweight Championship for the second time at the event against Austin Aries. Angle avoided a Heat Seeking Missile by Aries, leading to Aries getting crashed into the guardrail outside the ring. Angle tossed him back into the ring and attempted an Angle Slam but Aries countered with a roll-up for a near-fall. Angle then applied an ankle lock on Aries and forced him to submit to retain the title. Ethan Carter III attacked Angle after the match and raised the World Heavyweight Championship title belt above his head. ==ResultsReferences== Category:Destination X Category:2015 in professional wrestling Category:Professional wrestling in Orlando, Florida Category:2015 in Florida Category:May 2015 sports events in the United States Category:2015 American television episodes Category:2010s American television specials ","title":"Destination X (2015)"},{"id":"56121805","text":"Destination X (2016) (aka Impact Wrestling: Destination X) was a professional wrestling event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion, which took place on July 12, 2016 at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida.

Six professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. The main event was a title versus title match, in which the World Heavyweight Champion Lashley and the X Division Champion Eddie Edwards defended their respective titles. Moose made his TNA debut during the match and attacked both participants, resulting in the match ending in a no contest. On the undercard, Sienna retained the Knockouts Championship against Gail Kim, Jade and Marti Bell in a four-way match, Bram defeated Abyss. DJ Z competed at the event twice; first he won a six-man ladder match to become the #1 contender for the X Division Championship and then DJZ defeated Mike Bennett. ==Background== TNA continued the tradition that began in 2012 where the current X Division Champion can invoke \\"Option C\\" ‚Äì a concept in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the championship in exchange for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event. On the July 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA World Heavyweight Champion Lashley offered a title for title option to X Division Champion Eddie Edwards in lieu of Edwards having to invoke \\"Option C.\\" ==Event== Preliminary matches The event kicked off with a ladder match to determine the #1 contender for the X Division Championship between DJ Z, Rockstar Spud, Mandrews, Braxton Sutter, Trevor Lee and Andrew Everett. DJ Z knocked out Lee with a DDT and then knocked Everett off the ladder and climbed the ladder to retrieve the X for the win. Mike Bennett attacked DJ Z from behind. Later that night, DJ Z challenged Bennett to a match, which Bennett accepted. The match was followed by an interview between Lashley and Eddie Edwards, hyping up their main event match, during which Lashley attacked Edwards and hit him with a running powerslam and then tried to hit him with a chair but Davey Richards countered and hit Lashley with the chair in the back forcing Richards to retreat. Next, Bram took on Abyss. A distraction by Rosemary allowed Bram to hit a running knee to Abyss sending him into an interfering Crazzy Steve on the apron and then Bram rolled him up for the win. Next, Sienna defended the Knockouts Championship against Gail Kim, Jade and Marti Bell. Kim nailed an Eat Defeat to Belle and covered her for the pinfall but Allie put Belle's foot on the ropes. Gail then attempted to nail a suicide dive but Sienna caught her with a Silencer to retain the title. Later, Mike Bennett took on DJ Z. Bennett tried to retreat to the backstage but The Helms Dynasty, Braxton Sutter and Mandrews prevented him from escaping and tossed him into the ring, where DJ Z rolled him up for the win. It was followed by an unsanctioned fight between Drew Galloway and Ethan Carter III. They brawled with each other throughout the arena forcing several security guards, referees and wrestlers to separate them from each other. Main event match The main event was a title versus title match, in which the World Heavyweight Champion Lashley took on the X Division Champion Eddie Edwards and both men defended the World Heavyweight Championship and the X Division Championship respectively. Lashley countered a Boston Knee Party by Edwards into a powerslam and knocked out the referee in the process who got kicked by Edwards' feet. Lashley then tried to hit Edwards with the World Heavyweight Championship title belt but Richards prevented him from using the belt and then Edwards and Davey Richards hit Lashley with the title and Edwards got a near-fall on Lashley. Mike Bennett then interfered in the match by punching the referee. Bennett then called out the debuting Moose, who attacked Lashley, Edwards and Richards. ==ResultsReferences== Category:Destination X Category:2016 in professional wrestling Category:Professional wrestling in Orlando, Florida Category:2016 in Florida Category:2016 American television episodes Category:2010s American television specials Category:July 2016 sports events in the United States ","title":"Destination X (2016)"},{"id":"56121815","text":"I'm Not the Same Girl is an album by Stacy Lattisaw, released by Cotillion Records in 1985.

The pay- per-view itself started with a Little Italy Street Fight between The Latin American Exchange (Homicide and Hernandez) and Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon). Prior to the start of the match, there were small tables set up in the ring to represent an Italian bistro. Devon hit a reverse DDT on Hernandez, but Hernandez kicked out at 2. He was then able to hit Devon with the Border Toss to pick up the victory. The next match saw Senshi defeat Austin Starr, after missing a Warriors Way from the top, followed by a chickenwing. After the match, Starr begins filling the ring with chairs. He then grabbed the mic and started complaining about the match. Bob Backlund came out and put his own chickenwing on Starr before dragging him to the back. The following match was a Tuxedo match between Christy Hemme and the \\"Big Fat Oily Guy\\". Christy ultimately won the match when she removed the pants of the \\"Big Fat Oily Guy‚Äù to reveal an ill-fitting G-string. The next match was a \\"Basebrawl\\" match between Lance Hoyt and Dale Torborg. Hoyt came to the ring for the match with David Eckstein and Torborg came out with A. J. Pierzynski. Hoyt picked up the win after Eckstein hit Torborg with a steel chair. Next was a strap match labelled as a \\"Motor City Chain match\\". This match saw A.J. Styles face off against Rhino. The match was set up with the chain and a pole in two corners, one with a key and one with a nightstick. Styles picked up the victory after Rhino attempted to Gore him through the table, but Styles moved out of the way and Rhino went through the table. The TNA X Division Championship match was next, seeing Chris Sabin successfully defending his title against Jerry Lynn. During the match, Sabin hit Lynn with a Spiralbomb which injured his back. When Lynn later went for a piledriver, his back gave out, forcing him to drop Sabin. Sabin used this opportunity to capitalize and pick up the victory, covering Lynn while using the ropes for leverage. The next match was a mixed tag team match which saw James Storm and Jacqueline Moore take on Petey Williams and Gail Kim. While Kim had Moore rolled up, Storm kicked Kim in the face, enabling Moore to cover her and pick up the victory. After the match, Storm went to hit Williams with a beer bottle, but he was able to avoid it. Storm then hit Williams with a superkick and Moore then jumped on Williams‚Äô back followed by a DDT. As they attempted to hit him with a Death Sentence, Chris Harris made his return and ran in to make the save. The second to last match was a Prison Yard match between Sting and Abyss. Inside the ring was a cage, and the first person to lock their opponent in the cage would be declared the winner. When James Mitchell interfered, Sting put him in the Scorpion Deathlock, which gave Abyss the opportunity to attack him from behind. Abyss then picked up Sting and put him through a table. Sting then put a barbwire board on the table and powerbombed Abyss off the cage and through the barbwire. Sting then put Abyss in the cage to pick up the victory. The final match saw the NWA World Heavyweight Championship being defended, when Christian Cage took on the challenger Kurt Angle. Tomko, who came out to the ring with Cage, was ejected prior to the match. After he left, Samoa Joe came out with a chair and sat on the ramp to watch the match. During the match, Tomko came back out and attacked Joe while Scott Steiner came out and began attacking Angle. Joe eventually dove from the ring onto Steiner and Tomko outside the ring, and the three fought to the back. In the ensuing chaos, the referee was knocked down, which enabled Cage to hit Angle with a steel pipe. He then hit Angle with the Unprettier and pinned him to retain the title. ==ResultsReferences== Category:Professional wrestling in Orlando, Florida Category:Events in Orlando, Florida Category:2007 in Florida Category:TNA Against All Odds Category:February 2007 events in the United States Category:2007 Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view events ","title":"Against All Odds (2007)"},{"id":"56121964","text":"John Derek Jones (1927 ‚Äì 9 March 2013) was an English Congregationalist missionary and politician in Botswana.

Dualism in cybernetics refers to systems or problems in which one or more intelligent adversaries attempt to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator. Examples could include a game- playing opponent, adversarial law, evolutionary systems of predator/parasite and prey/host, or politics/enslavement attempts. == Background == Dualism in cybernetics emerged from the notion that there is another form of dualism besides the classical mind-matter dualism and this is the form-matter variant first proposed by the philosopher Anaxagoras and further developed by Plato and Aristotle. Norbert Wiener, the founder of cybernetics, used this as the basis of his position that information is a different reality from matter and energy. In the foundational discipline of cybernetics that he developed, Wiener also drew from the Cartesian dualism, which differentiated non- cognitive body and non-extended/disembodied mind. He outlined a dualism that opposed matter/energy with information and proposed that it is possible for the living and non-living to be within the same wall that once divided them. Gregory Bateson contributed to the development of this notion of dualism through his theory of mind, which proposed that the mind extends the boundaries of the brain and body so that it is able to take multiple feedback loops, which then creates the link between organisms and the rest of the natural world. The key element here is the concept of feedback, which allows the identification of causal loops so that a system is able to make changes to its behavior and receive information back from the environment concerning the change of such behavioral change, using it as a basis for future actions. This cybernetic idea challenged the traditional subject/object dualism. == Opposition vs complexity == Wiener contrasted \\"Manichean devils\\" (dualistic adversarial systems) with \\"Augustinian devils\\"‚Äîsystems or problems that, though very complex and difficult to figure out, did not feature an adversary with contrary intent. Victories or \\"expansions of knowledge\\" in the latter type of system were able to be built upon incrementally, through science (experimentation expanding empirical knowledge bases). Wiener noted that temporary weaknesses (such as errors to perceive all components of a system) were not fatal in attempts to defeat \\"Augustinian devils\\" because another experiment could simply be pursued (and he noted that he had personally defeated many \\"Augustinian devils\\" with his contributions to science and engineering). By contrast, Wiener observed that temporary lapses in judgment against \\"Manichean devils\\" were more often fatal or destructive, due to the desire of the opponent to \\"win/survive at all costs\\", even by introducing deception into the system. He said that he had been defeated by many \\"Manichean devils\\", such as on occasions when he was temporarily careless in chess. Although this duality between complexity (in the case of the Augustinian devils) and opposition (in the case of Manichean devils) may seem obvious, it holds deep implications for many areas of science, such as game theory, political science, computer science, network science, security science, military science, evolutionary biology, and cryptography. ==References== Category:Cybernetics Category:Dualism Category:Philosophy Category:Theories ","title":"Dualism (cybernetics)"},{"id":"56121991","text":"Aylesbury War Memorial in the Market Square Aylesbury War Memorial is located in Market Square, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England.Aylesbury.

According to Viv Groskop of The Guardian, A Russian Diary has a stronger emphasis on politics compared to A Dirty War and Putin's Russia, and therefore is \\"less moving and immediate\\". It does not focus on Politkovskaya's personal life. According to the book, Russia under Vladimir Putin reverted into an authoritarian society centered around the ruler. ==Content== The book has three parts. The initial section covers the 2003 Russian legislative election and the 2004 Russian presidential election. The following section discusses the insurgency of the Second Chechen War, the Beslan school siege and its consequences, and other events in the second Putin term. She recalled a meeting with Ramzan Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic. The last section describes 2005 pensioner protests.

In the 1990s, she was one of the first girls to be given a bursary by Camfed for her secondary school education. The bursary included money for her education, as well as her school uniform, shoes and schooling equipment. Camfed is a charity setup by Ann Cotton, who met Murimirwa in Zimbabwe, to support girls to go to school who would otherwise be denied an education because of poverty. As of 2014, Camfed has provided financial and educational support to more than three million girls. Before her appointment as executive director ‚Äì Africa, Murimirwa worked as the regional executive director for Camfed in Southern & Eastern Africa. In 1998, Murimirwa was helped set up the Camfed Alumnae Network (CAMA), which began with a few hundred women. By 2012, CAMA had 17,000 members in five African countries. The network celebrated 100,000 members in 2017. In 2005, Murimirwa presented at a Global Exchange forum, and in 2006, she was awarded the prize for Women's Creativity in Rural Life by the Women's World Summit Foundation. Murimirwa was featured in the 2009 book Half the Sky by Pulitzer Prize winning novelists Sheryl WuDunn and Nicholas Kristof. In 2014, she spoke at an event with Michelle Obama. In 2016, Murimirwa attended a Camfed event where Julia Gillard, former Prime Minister of Australia, became a patron of the organisation. During the event, Murimirwa stated that \\"Locally tailored solutions, respectful of context and building on local resources, are key to our success.\\" In 2017, she was awarded the 2017 Diamond Ball Honors Award by the Clara Lionel Foundation.

Based on Portuguese tiles called azulejos, in Azul players collect sets of similarly colored tiles which they place on their player board. When a row is filled, one of the tiles is moved into a square pattern on the right side of the player board, where it garners points depending on where it is placed in relation to other tiles on the board. == Gameplay == Tile repositories. When tiles of a color are taken from any of the cardboard discs, the leftover tiles on that disc are moved to the center. From two to four players collect tiles to fill up a 5x5 player board. Players collect tiles by taking all the tiles of one color from a repository, and placing them in a row, taking turns until all the tiles for that round are taken. At that point, one tile from every filled row moves over to each player's 5x5 board, while the rest of the tiles in the filled row are discarded. Each tile scores based on where it is placed in relation to other tiles on the board. Rounds continue until at least one player has made a row of tiles all the way across their 5x5 board. The basic game dictates where tiles of each color go on their player board, while an advanced version allows players to place them anywhere. == Development == In an interview with Pretzel Games, Kiesling described the design process as a two-phase process, with the question of how the tiles would be distributed. == Reception == Keith Law, writing for Paste Magazine, said \\"The theme doesn't really tie into or matter for the game play, but the artwork is just fantastic and...will give Azul a ton of shelf appeal in a market where maybe publishers don't pay as much attention to that aspect of marketing.\\" Nate Anderson of Ars Technica described it as \\"an ideal weeknight game, or a game night opener, or a family title.\\" Emily VanDerWerff, writing for Vox, said \\"Azul has made the leap from hardcore hobbyist circles to the shelves of Target and other stores where it might be selected by grandmas shopping for their grandkids...absolutely every aspect of playing the game is at once instantly understandable and agreeably fun ‚Äì right down to how those tiles feel in your hand.\\" == Awards and nominations == Azul has won a number of board gaming awards and received numerous nominations: # 2018 Spiel des Jahres award # 2018 Origins Award for Best Family Game and Fan Favorite # 2018 Dice Tower Award for Best Family Game # 2018 As d'Or ‚Äì Jeu de l'Ann√©e Winner # 2018 Mensa Select Certification # 2017 Meeples' Choice Nominee # 2017 Cardboard Republic Architect Laurel Winner # 2017 Golden Geek Best Family Game of the Year # 2017 Golden Geek Board Game of the Year Runner-up == Sequel/Series== Plan B Games has released a second title in the Azul line, Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra, which increases the game's complexity via clear tiles and two sided window panes on the player boards. A third game in the series, Azul: Summer Pavilion, was released in the fall of 2019. A fourth game, Axul: Crystal Mozaic has since been released. It's an expansion to Azul with as main selling point a plastic overlay to organize all the Azul tiles while you play. This game however, has been less well received by critics than the previous games in the series, because the plastic overlay doesn't fit the pieces perfectly. == References  External links == *Dice Tower review of Azul *I Play Red walkthrough of Azul *Score manager app on Google Play Category:Board games Category:Board games introduced in 2017 Category: Abstract strategy games Category:Origins Award winners Category:Spiel des Jahres winners Category:Tile-based board games ","title":"Azul (board game)"},{"id":"56122214","text":"The Aero-Vederci Baby!

It is the 26th overall episode of the series and is written by Melissa Scrivner Love and directed by Jeffrey Hunt. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on October 18, 2012. ==Plot== As Finch (Michael Emerson) tries to readjust to life after his kidnapping, establishing a bond with Reese's attack dog Bear, Reese (Jim Caviezel) identifies the new number as Sofia Campos (Paloma Guzm√°n), the spoiled daughter of a Brazilian consul in New York. Reese creates a vacancy for her bodyguard, then secures himself for the job by stealing all the other candidates wallets. Despite her hostile attitude, Reese proves himself to be far better at protecting her than her previous bodyguards. After discovering that she has a secret American boyfriend called Jack, Reese earns her respect by keeping her secret from her father. Carter (Taraji P. Henson) has taken over the Corwin investigation, using the evidence that Fusco (Kevin Chapman) secured. While at the morgue, she encounters Mark Snow (Michael Kelly), who claims that he has been reassigned. After learning that he was also interested in Corwin, Carter tries to call him using the phone number he previously gave her, only to get an unknown male inquiring about her encounter with Snow, then promising to be in touch. Reese takes Sofia to meet her friend Gabi at a club, but instead ends up saving her from assassins. Sofia explains that she and Gabi partied with Paul Romano at his penthouse on Saturday, before leaving when a thuggish-looking guy turned up. Finch discovers Paul died after he took a dive from his window later that night, Reese identifies the man as one of the assassins, and realises that Sofia is being targeted because she can place him at the scene of the murder. Carter locates Gabi at the morgue, and identifies the man as Monty, a leader of the 14th Street Mafia street gang. Reese asks Finch to keep Sofia company, but he finds himself unable to leave the library, so Sofia goes with Fusco to a party her Father is throwing for the Brazilian President. Reese learns that Sophia has become the target of a drug smuggling operation, who believe that she and a friend witnessed their operations. Analysing the video, Finch realises that the boyfriend, Jack, was the silent partner fronting the money to bankroll the drug operation, but by this time Sofia has snuck out of the party to meet with him; Jack then betrays Sofia by handing her over to Monty. After Reese, Carter, and Fusco rescue her, Sofia breaks up with Jack by having Reese hang him over the side of a building. In the end, Carter is approached by another CIA Agent asking about Snow, but Carter points out that if they've lost him it is not her job to find him: in reality, Snow is being held hostage by Kara Stanton (Annie Parisse). Reese then takes Finch out of the library for a drink. ==Reception== Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Masquerade\\" was seen by an estimated 13.93 million household viewers and gained a 2.8/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 14.58 million viewers with a 3.0/8 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night, beating Elementary but behind Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Grey's Anatomy, Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory. Critical reviews \\"Masquerade\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Person Of Interest has even managed to add a faithful dog to its regular cast without making me gag. Considering how much talent goes into the average hour of television, and what networks pay people to exercise their talents, meat-and-potatoes genre fare as satisfying as Person Of Interest is now is really the least viewers ought to expect. But as anyone who's seen much of the current fall TV season knows, the networks have been managing to mostly serve up a lot less.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com wrote \\"'Masquerade' was a perfect example of why Person of Interest is able to perform at high levels from week to week. The case was ho-hum, but the show's unique style of humor elevated it to a level of hypnotizing watchability. Jonathan Nolan and Greg Plageman have created a simple recipe that's hard to mess up, but then they add flourishes of complexity that reward those who are truly invested. Carry on, Person of Interest.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.6 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"It's hard not to gush over the return of Person of Interest, especially after being bumped by the debates last week, but the fact that it's in full form is fantastic. This episode certainly made me all smiles and even getting Reese to smile made things that much more fun. If you aren't watching, you're missing out on a great show.\\" == References External links== * \\"Masquerade\\" at CBS * * \\"Masquerade\\" at TV Guide * Category:Person of Interest (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Masquerade (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"56122244","text":"Kingdom is a hamlet located in the towns of Columbia and Warren in Herkimer County, New York. ==References== Category:Hamlets in Herkimer County, New York Category:Hamlets in New York (state) ","title":"Kingdom, New York"},{"id":"56122247","text":"Harry P.

After the war, he studied law at the Free University Amsterdam and, in 1951, he was involved in the founding of the Surinamese cultural association Wie Eegie Sanie (\\"our own things\\"). Bruma considered his own native language so important, that he addressed the World Youth Congress in Bucharest in Sranan Tongo. After returning to Suriname in 1954, he settled as a lawyer in Paramaribo. In addition, he was also politically active. In 1959, he founded the \\"Nationalist Movement Suriname\\", which merged with the Nationalist Republican Party (PNR) in 1961.Eddy Bruma. Suriname.nu. Retrieved on 2017-12-24. The PNR strived for immediate independence, while the National Party of Suriname led by Johan Pengel only wanted it in the long term. In that year, the PNR did not obtain a seat at the States elections. In the elections of 24 October 1969, his party did have a seat, after which Bruma, as a member of the parliament, opposed the government led by Prime Minister Jules Sedney. He was also chairman of the Progressive Labour Federation 47 (C-47; a counterpart to the General Alliance of Labour Unions, which was linked to the NPS), until he was succeeded by Freddy Derby. In 1973, the PNR was one of the parties that was part of the National Party Combination (NPK), which won 22 out of 39 seats. After these elections, Bruma was the Minister of Economic Affairs in the Arron cabinet for four years, while his party colleague Eddy Hoost became Minister of Justice.Eddy Bruma, Surinaams nationalist 1925 - 2000. Trouw. Retrieved on 2017-12-24. During that reign, the ideal of Bruma was realized; Suriname became independent from the Netherlands in 1975. In the parliamentary elections of 1977, the PNR did not manage to secure a seat. After the military coup in 1980 led by D√©si Bouterse, Bruma became the formateur of the Chin A Sen government, in which, in addition to civilians, members of the National Military Council (NMR) were involved. Chin A Sen, a physician, was a member of the PNR, but was not politically active before. Afterwards, he was mainly active as a lawyer, and sometimes he gave political advice. In October 2000, he was robbed at his home, resulting in a skull fracture. A few weeks later, he died of those injuries in a hospital at the age of 75. President Ronald Venetiaan gave a speech at his state funeral. ==Author== The first publication of Wie Eegie Sanie was not in Sranan Tongo, but written in Frisian, and published by the Frisian magazine De Tsjerne in 1952. The main reason was the recent acceptance of the Frisian language after Kneppelfreed. Bruma hoped that the Frisians would support his efforts of normalisation of Sranan Tongo. A large crowd gathered to hear the introduction by Fedde Schurer, but Bruma expected more sympathy for his cause. That same year, Bruma also wrote De geboorte van Boni about the history of Maroon leader Boni in Dutch, and published poetry in Sranan Tongo for Koenders' Foetoe-boi. In 1954, Bruma became editor covering for Suriname for the De Tsjerne. In 1957, Bruma translated his novel about Boni in Sranan Tongo. == References External links== * Eddy Bruma at Digital Library for Dutch Literature (in Dutch and Frisian) * Eddy Bruma at Werkgroep Cara√Øbische Letteren (in Dutch) Category:1925 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Government ministers of Suriname Category:People from Paramaribo Category:Surinamese lawyers Category:Surinamese male writers Category:Surinamese poets Category:West Frisian-language writers Category:Writers in Sranan Tongo Category:Nationalist Republican Party (Suriname) politicians Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Eddy Bruma"},{"id":"56122338","text":"Sextus Pompeius Collega was a Roman senator and orator active during the last half of the first century AD.

She moved to Harbel, Margibi County to her grandparents during the First Liberian Civil War before returning Montserrado County in 1993 to settle in the ELWA Community. She completed her secondary education at the Calvary Chapel Mission School in 2004 before obtaining her BBA degree in management in 2013 from the University of Liberia. In her secondary years, Martina was actively involved into sporting activities. She played on the Calvary Chapel Mission School kickball team that participated mostly in the Inter School Sports Association League. She captained the Calvary Chapel Mission School quizzing team in the 2004 national quizzing competition held in honor of Rufus Neufville. UShe missed out on winning tournament as her school was beaten in the semi-finals. She was later named the best female quizzer of the tournament and was awarded a scholarship from the government of Liberia. ==Journalism== She ventured into journalism in 2005 when she took up an internship at UNMIL Radio, where Brooks was trained to present and produce radio programs. At the end of her internship, she received offers from other media outlets, but chose to remain at UNMIL Radio. At UNMIL Radio, she transitioned into producing for a sports program called 'Europe League Round Up,' where she previewed happenings in the various European football leagues. Brooks' passion for sports led her push to report on events from the field. She has now built an impressive repertoire, having covered events ranging from Liberia Football Association league games, the Liberian National County Meet, the Liberia Marathon, and athletics competitions. Her dedication to the craft eventually caught the attention of her male colleagues and Brooks was named as the Sports Writer Association of Liberia most improved sports journalist in 2011. As she has gotten to play a larger role within the Sports Writer Association of Liberia, Brooks used her influence to turn the group, which previously consisted of only men, into a more gender-sensitive organization. As a result, women were motivated to get involved into reporting sports. After more than a decade at the UNMIL Radio, Martina was given a different assignment as she was sent to South Sudan to work as Senior Radio Producer of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan radio. ==Sports Writer Association of Liberia== In 2011, she was elected as the Vice President of the Sports Writer Association of Liberia.

The creation of the LC was prompted by Apple's desire to produce a product that could be sold to school boards for the same price as an Apple IIGS. It was designed for inexpensive manufacturing, with five major components that robots could assemble. The computer had a $2400 list price; it and the new $600 12-inch color display were $3500 less expensive than the Macintosh II. Not long after the Apple IIe Card was introduced for the LC, Apple officially announced the retirement of the IIGS, as the company wanted to focus its sales and marketing efforts on the LC. The original Macintosh LC was introduced on October 1990, with initial shipments to dealers following in December and January. It was replaced by Macintosh LC II, which was largely the same but was built around a Motorola 68030 processor. == Hardware == Internal view of a Macintosh LC. The LC uses a \\"pizza box\\" case with a Processor Direct Slot (PDS) but no NuBus slots. It has a 16 MHz 68020 microprocessor which lacks a floating-point coprocessor (although one could be added via the PDS). The LC has a 16-bit data bus, which is a major performance bottleneck as the 68020 is a 32-bit CPU. The LC's memory management chipset places a limit of 10 MB RAM no matter how much was installed. The LC shipped with 256 kB of VRAM, supporting a display resolution of 512√ó384 pixels at 8-bit color. The VRAM is upgradeable to 512 kB, supporting a display resolution of 512√ó384 pixels at 16-bit color or 640√ó480 pixels at 8-bit color. The LC was commonly purchased with an Apple 12\\" RGB monitor which had a fixed resolution of 512√ó384 pixels and a form factor exactly matching the width of the LC chassis, giving the two together a near all-in-one appearance. An Apple 13\\" 640√ó480 Trinitron display was also available, but at a list price of $999, it cost almost as much as the LC itself. Until the introduction of the LC, the lowest resolution supported on color Macs had been 640√ó480. Many programs written for color Macintosh II family computers had assumed this as a minimum, and some were unusable at the lower resolution. For several years software developers had to add support for this smaller screen resolution in order to guarantee that their software would run on LCs (as well as Color Classics which use the same resolution). Overall, general performance of the machine was disappointing due to the crippling data bus bottleneck, making it run far slower than the 16 MHz 68020-based Macintosh II from 1987, which had an identical processor but ran almost twice as fast. One difference between the Mac II and the Mac LC is the latter had no socket for a 68851 MMU. Therefore, it could not take advantage of System 7's virtual memory features. The standard configuration included a floppy drive and a 40 MB or 80 MB hard drive, but a version was available for the education market which had an Apple II card in the PDS slot, two floppy drives, and no hard drive. The LC was the final Macintosh model to allow for dual internal floppy drives. The LC, as with other Macs of the day, featured built-in networking on the serial port using LocalTalk. Ethernet was also available as an option via the single PDS slot. If the single expansion slot was a limitation, multifunction cards were available combining Ethernet functionality with an MMU or FPU socket. Apple IIe Card The Apple IIe Card for the PDS slot was offered in a bundle with education models of the LCs. The card allowed the LC to emulate an Apple IIe. The combination of a low-cost color Macintosh with Apple IIe compatibility was intended to encourage the education market to transition from aging Apple II models to the Macintosh platform instead of to the new low-cost IBM PC compatibles. Despite the LC's minimal video specs with a 12\\" monitor, any LC that supports the card can be switched into 560√ó384 resolution for better compatibility with the IIe's 280√ó192 High-Resolution graphics (essentially doubled). == Models == Introduced October 15, 1990: * Macintosh LC: 2 MB RAM, 40 MB HDD. == References  External links == * Apple Macintosh LC (Original) Specs at everymac.com. * Mac LC at lowendmac.com.

Forming as the twenty-sixth named storm of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, Kai-tak formed as a tropical depression near Palau on December 11. Slowly intensifying, the system became a tropical storm on December 14. Due to its slow motion, Kai-tak made landfall in Samar on December 16, and traversed the Philippine islands. Kai-tak later moved in a west-southwestward direction until it dissipated on December 23 near Malaysia. ==Meteorological history== On December 10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to monitor on a tropical depression located about 130 km (81 mi) to the east of Palau. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression the next day, and began issuing advisories on 00:00 UTC of December 12. Nine hours later, the PAGASA declared that the system had intensified into a tropical depression, and was immediately given the local name Urduja. On December 13, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On 21:00 UTC of that same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and also began issuing advisories, giving the identifier 32W. Despite the system being poorly organized with loose banding, the system also was located in an area of very low wind shear. Three hours later, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the international name Kai-tak. ==Preparations and impact== On December 14, as soon as PAGASA upgraded Kai-tak (Urduja) to a tropical storm, Public Storm Warning Signal #2 was immediately raised in Eastern Samar, Samar and Biliran. Public Storm Warning Signal #1 was also raised in the majority of Bicol Region (Region V) and much of Visayas while moderate to heavy rainfall were warned within the 400-km diameter of the storm. Residents were already advised to \\"undertake appropriate measures\\" against flooding as the moderate to heavy rainfall area was extended to within the 500-km diameter on December 15. PAGASA also announced the possibility of a storm surge of 4.1‚Äì14 meters over in Samar. The city of Tacloban was later placed under a state of calamity as decided by their local council as 80 of the 130 villages were flooded. This resulted in at least 728 families (1,418 individuals) brought to evacuation centers or schools. Animation of issued PSWS for Tropical Storm Kai-Tak (Urduja) when crossing the Philippines. The NDRRMC confirmed a total of 83 people dead and calculated a total of Php3.747 billion (US$74.3 million) worth of infrastructure and agricultural damages. ==Retirement== On December 21, 2017, the PAGASA has announced that the name Urduja had been stricken off from their naming lists after causing more than ‚Ç±1 billion worth of damages. Its replacement name was announces to be Uwan, and is to be used for the 2021 season.

The course of the river flows in the townships of Ch√©risy, Beaulieu and Blaiklock. This river flows into the Albanel, Mistassini and Blaiklock Lakes Wildlife Sanctuary.

The surface of the \\"Blaiklock River\\" is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however safe ice traffic is generally from mid-November to mid-April. == Geography  Toponymy == This hydronym uses the same name as the township of Blaiklock. This term evokes the memory of Frederic William Blaiklock (1822-1901), surveyor, native of Quebec (city). He was the first to conduct topographic measurements in the valley of the Ashuapmushuan River which is located north of Lac Saint-Jean. He also mapped out the two provincial roads leading to Lac Saint-Jean, via Stoneham and via La Tuque. From 1850 to 1853, he surveyed the territorial boundaries between Canada and New Brunswick. For 23 years (1878-1901), he was in charge of the Cadastre Office at Montreal.

The plane was carrying 17 professional gamblers returning home from Caesar's Palace Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, along with 2 crew members. It was chartered by Caesar's Palace (New Jersey). All 19 passengers and crews on board were killed instantly. An investigation was conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board. It found that while the aircraft was approaching Scranton International Airport, it ran out of fuel. The investigation found that the crews were supposed to refill the aircraft with a total of 180 gallons of fuel. Instead, they refilled with 90 gallons. Although the final report concluded that fuel exhaustion was the cause of the crash, it was not received warmly by some relatives of the victims. Several of them filled lawsuits against Executive Airlines and British Aerospace. Executive Airlines chief executive Michael Peragine questioned the NTSB report, claiming that it dismissed several other factors that might have been beneficial to the investigation. ==Flight== The crew initially was supposed to take a flight from Farmingdale, New York to Atlantic City, New Jersey at 09:00 local time. However, the crew later received a phone call from the Executive Airlines' owner and CEO detailing that they had been assigned another flight to Wilkes- Barre, with a return flight to Atlantic City later in the day. Ninety gallons of fuel was added to the aircraft, and it departed for Farmingdale at 09:21 local time with 12 passengers on board, under command of Captain Cam Basat. It arrived at Atlantic City International Airport at 09:49. The second leg of the flight was from Atlantic City to Wilkes-Barre. This flight segment was flown by the same crew, with First Officer Gregory MacVicar as pilot flying. No fuel was added on this flight segment. The plane departed Atlantic City at 10:30 with 17 passengers on board. It was cleared to fly at 5,000' above mean sea level. Approach to Wilkes-Barre As the flight neared Wilkes-Barre, the crew established contact with the approach controller for clearance, which was granted. The crew was given a radar vector for an ILS approach. Their first attempt to land, however, was not successful. The crew executed a missed approach, and started a second approach with another ILS radar vector. Start of engine failure At 11:23, the crew declared an emergency and indicated they had an \\"engine failure\\". The crew was given yet another radar vector by the air traffic controller. At 11:25, as the aircraft was descending through 3,000', the controller warned that the minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) was 3,300' within the sector. The controller also read out the weather condition in the vicinity, and informed the crew about the location of nearby highways, suggesting that they could make an emergency landing. The crew declined, and asked for a radar vector to the airport. As the radar vector was given to the crew, the flight disappeared from the radar screen. Communications between the crew and the controller, however, continued. Crash At 11:27, the crew reported that they had \\"gotten back the left engine now\\", and radar contact was re-established. However, a few seconds later the crew reported that they had lost both engines. The controller informed them that the Pennsylvania Turnpike was right below them, and requested they \\"let [ATC] know if you can get your engines back\\". There was no further radio contact. Emergency crews were notified at 11:30, and began searching for the crash site. The wreckage was found at 12:45 p.m local time. There were no survivors. In response to the crash, the airport fire department was turned into a makeshift encampment for the relatives of the victims. ==Passengers and crews== The pilot flying on the crash leg was First Officer Gregory MacVicar, age 38. At the time of the accident, he had accumulated 1,282 total flying hours, of which about 742 hours were in the Jetstream 3101. He joined Executive Airlines on November 9, 1998. The pilot monitoring was Captain Cam Basat, age 34. He joined Executive Airlines in 1998 as a part-time pilot. At the time, he was a full-time pilot for Atlantic Coast Airlines. At the time of the accident, the captain had accumulated about 8,500 flying hours, including about 1,874 hours as pilot-in-command in the Jetstream. ==Aircraft== The plane involved in the accident was a British Aerospace Jetstream 3101, registered as N16EJ. It was delivered by British Aerospace on 1988 as N851JS. Executive Airlines purchased the airplane on October 28, 1996, from Fairchild Dornier. Its registration was changed to N16EJ on September 1997. First operation of the plane was in December 1997. At the time of the accident, the plane had accumulated a total of 18,503 cycles, totaling 13,972 flight hours. It was discovered that the plane had been involved in several incidents before the crash. In 1989, the plane was substantially damaged after it overran a runway and impacted terrain after an aborted take-off. In 1991, the plane had an engine fire. ==Investigation== The crash site indicated that there was \\"minimum fire damage\\" to the surrounding vegetation, leading to a suspicion that the plane may have been low on fuel The ATC recording showed that, while the plane was approaching Scranton, the crew on board transmitted a message that an engine failure had occurred on board. The NTSB suspected that fuel exhaustion may have caused the failure. This was proved by their examination of the crash site. The NTSB stated that had the flight been filled with sufficient fuel, then the burnt area should have been wider than expected. In the case of this flight, the burnt area was concentrated into a small and compact area. Analysis of the airplane log pages and flight crew records indicated that about 1,000 pounds of fuel were on board the airplane before the 600 pounds (90 gallons) were added on the day of the accident. The NTSB revealed that the crew had planned to add another 180 gallons of fuel. According to the NTSB, if the flight crew intended to load 180 gallons (about 1,200 pounds), it was common industry and company practice to ask for 90 gallons on each side (the left tank and right tank). However, due to a miscommunication, only 90 gallons (600 pounds) of fuel were added to the plane. The crew did order 90 gallons of fuel, but did not specify that it should be added to both tanks. Thus, only 90 gallons of fuel were added, a total confirmed by the fuel order receipt, which the crew most likely did not read. Captain Basat and First Officer MacVicar then completed the load manifest. They stated that the plane was loaded with 2,400 pounds of fuel when it departed from Farmingdale. In reality, there were only 1,600 pounds of fuel on board, 800 pounds less than intended. Calculations by the NTSB revealed that if the plane were loaded with a total of 2,400 pounds of fuel, then the crew would not have had to refuel in Atlantic City. Since the crew believed that there were enough fuel on board, they apparently ignored the low fuel quantity annunciator lights that should have warned them of their lack of fuel. However, the NTSB stated that these lights can be easily \\"overlooked\\". As the plane ran out of fuel, the right engine stopped. This failure on the right engine caused the plane to deviate from its planned track. Although the pilots were able to restart the engine, it failed again seconds later, along with the left engine. Low airspeed then caused loss of control of the plane. The final accident report was published on August 29, 2002, and concluded the cause of the crash was pilot error: ==See also== * United Airlines Flight 173 == References == Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Pennsylvania Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by fuel exhaustion Category:Disasters in Pennsylvania Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2000 Category:2000 disasters in the United States Category:Accidents and incidents involving the British Aerospace Jetstream Category:May 2000 events in the United States Category:2000 in Pennsylvania ","title":"2000 East Coast Aviation Services British Aerospace Jetstream crash"},{"id":"56122760","text":"The Koch'am T'an'gwang Line, or Koch'am Colliery Line, is an electrified long freight-only railway line of the Korean State Railway in North Hamgy≈èng Province, North Korea, from My≈èngch'≈èn on the P'y≈èngra Line to Sinmy≈èngch'≈èn and the My≈èngch'≈èn Coal Complex.Kokubu, Hayato, Â∞ÜËªçÊßò„ÅÆÈâÑÈÅì (Sh≈çgun-sama no Tetsud≈ç) ==History== The line was originally opened around 1937 by the Chosen Government Railway. ==Route== A yellow background in the \\"Distance\\" box indicates that section of the line is not electrified. {  style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Distance (km) !! colspan=\\"2\\"  Station Name !! colspan=\\"2\\"  Former Name !! - !

Shore is a Superior Court Judge of San Diego County, California for Department SD-15. Shore's remarks were widely covered by the media after he announced that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution did not apply to chalk on the sidewalk, and he prohibited the defendant from mentioning terms like \\"First Amendment\\" or \\"free speech\\" during the trial. ==Notable Cases== Sidewalk chalk case In October 2011, former U.S. Senator staffer Jeff Olson started protesting outside branches of Bank of America in San Diego. In response, bank official and former police officer Darell Freeman informed Olson that his credit union account at California Coast would be canceled if he continued to demonstrate, though Olson followed up with his bank and learned that wasn't true. Olson continued to protest, and in February 2012 he started writing anti-bank messages in chalk on the sidewalk in front of Bank of America branches. For the next 6 months, he visited a bank a few times a week to write slogans on the sidewalk such as \\"Stop big banks,\\" \\"No thanks, big banks,\\" and \\"Matthew 21:12\\" (a Bible verse where Jesus drove out bankers from the temple). In another case, Olson drew an octopus with bundles of cash held in its tentacles. On August 28, 2012, Olson was contacted by Officer Bill Miles on behalf of the San Diego Gang Unit and he stopped protesting soon after. It was reported that Olson had completely stopped protesting by the time Bob Filner was elected San Diego Mayor in November 2012. On January 7, 2013, the bank official (Freeman) requested that Officer Miles and then City Attorney Jan Goldsmith take action on Olson's case, even though he had stopped protesting.  13 counts of vandalism filed  On April 16, 2012, the city filed 13 counts of vandalism against Olson based on previous incidents reported by Freeman. Judge Shore was assigned to the case. Each count of vandalism on the document had a suggested sentence range of \\"1 Yr/$1,000,\\" indicating that Olson was facing a possible 13 years in prison plus a fine of $13,000 for the 13 chalk offenses. Although that was the theoretical maximum, local prosecutors and defense attorneys familiar with such cases were aware that the actual sentence, if convicted, would probably include a fine and some community service. Mayor Filner at the time said the case was a \\"waste of taxpayer money.\\" First plea bargain On May 16, Olson was offered a plea bargain to reduce his crimes to infractions, which would have given him a punishment of 32 hours of community service, a mandatory 8-hour seminar on behavior, a requirement to pay Bank of America $6,299 in restitution, a requirement to waive his Fourth Amendment rights regarding search and seizures, and a loss of his driver's licence for 3 years. Olson turned down the plea bargain. Prohibition on mentioning first amendment rights during trial On June 5, 2013, Judge Shore granted a motion by Deputy City Attorney Paige Hazard, which prohibited Olson's attorney Tom Tosdal from using any of the following terms during the trial: \\"First Amendment,\\" \\"free speech,\\" \\"political speech,\\" \\"public forum,\\" \\"free expression,\\" or \\"expressive conduct.\\" Media reports decried that Olson would not be allowed to claim his first amendment rights. However, Judge Shore stated that he was bound by precedent‚Äîspecifically the published decision of the California Court of Appeal in Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc.(2005)129 Cal.App.4th 1228, a case involving California's anti-SLAPP statute (strategic lawsuit against public participation). In a complex, lengthy decision, the Court of Appeal found certain activities of the employee to be constitutionally protected, but held, as to the vandalism, \\"Vandalism, of course, is not a legitimate exercise of free speech rights, and if the complaint arose only from such conduct it would not be subject to an anti- SLAPP motion.\\" 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 1245\\\\.  Second plea bargain  Olson was offered another plea bargain a week and a half later, on June 18, where pleading guilty to a single count of vandalism would reduce his sentence to three years probation, require him to pay restitution (undetermined amount), require he clean graffiti for 24 hours, and lose his driver's license for 2 years. Again, Olson turned down the plea bargain. Prohibition on contact with the media Olson's trial began on June 26, 2013. Soon after, several media reports decried the suggested sentences as excessive, including in The LA Times, the San Diego Reader, NPR, Gawker, New York Daily News and The Huffington Post. Shore objected to the reports that defense counsel and defendant were making statements to the media while the trial was ongoing, and issued a gag order that prohibited Olson or any witnesses involved with the case from having any contact with the media. He stated his concern that the case was being tried in the media, and that the comments could reach the jurors, who were bound by their oath to decide the case based only on the evidence presented at trial. He remarked to the defense that they probably wouldn't appreciate the prosecutor making statements to the media about why the defendant should be found guilty. Within a few days, approximately 30,000 people had signed a petition to stop the prosecution, and NPR showed that 95% of 15,000 people polled believed the charges were not justified. Final ruling After the jury deliberated for 2 hours, Olson was found not guilty of all 13 charges. The lead prosecutor, Paige Hazard, blamed Olson for turning down the plea offers and wasting taxpayer resources. An official statement from the City Attorney's Office criticized Olson for forcing the City to take the case to trial. Medical marijuana dispensary owner case Prohibition on mentioning state laws In 2010, Judge Shore ruled that a dispensary operator named Jovan Jackson was prohibited from using California's state medical marijuana law as part of his defense in a case for three charges of possession and sale of cannabis. Shore was required to interpret the meaning of the language in MMPA (Medical Marijuana Program Act (California Health and Safety Code 11362.7 et. seq.) that allowed a defense for patients \\"who associate for the purpose of collectively cultivating medical marijuana.\\" Judge Shore conducted a pre-trial hearing, and heard testimony that the collective to which Jackson belonged had 1674 members, only a few of whom were involved in cultivation. Shore held that the association was not formed for the purpose of cultivation, but for distribution. Jackson was convicted of a felony, and Judge Shore ordered him to pay a $5,000 fine, serve 6 months in jail, and serve 3 years of probation. In October 2012, the Court of Appeal reviewed Judge Shore's decision not to allow the collective cultivation defense, and Jackson's felony conviction was reversed. People v. Jackson (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 525. The Court did not expressly disagree with Judge Shore's analysis, but held that, because there was no established definition of the language Judge Shore was called upon to interpret, the issue should have gone to the jury. Jackson was retried before another judge, and was allowed to use the defense, but was nonetheless convicted of all charges by the jury. ==References== Category:21st-century American judges Category:Superior court judges in the United States Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Howard H.

The film is based on Zombies & Cheerleaders by David Light and Joseph Raso, and stars Milo Manheim and Meg Donnelly, playing zombie football player Zed and human cheerleader Addison who meet and fall in love, and who must lead their respective groups to coexist with each other. A sequel, Zombies 2, premiered on Disney Channel on February 14, 2020. == Plot == Fifty years ago in the planned community of Seabrook, an accident at the Seabrook Power Plant resulted in an explosion which caused half the population of Seabrook to turn into brain-eating zombies. Those that weren't affected constructed a wall to quarantine the zombies from the rest of Seabrook in a territory called Zombietown. The government later created bracelets for zombies, called Z-Bands, that deliver soothing electromagnetic pulses to keep zombies from craving brains. In the present day, zombie students from Zombietown transfer to the human high school, Seabrook High, where suburban life is filled with uniformity, traditions, and pep rallies. The zombies in the school are patrolled by Dale, whose daughter Addison and nephew Bucky are on the school's cheerleading team. Addison begins a relationship with a zombie student named Zed, who is an exceptional player on the school's football team due to his Z-Band being hacked by Eliza, one of his zombie friends. Addison and Zed's relationship is initially unknown to all of the students and staff except two of Zed's zombie friends, Eliza and Bonzo. Bucky, who leads the cheerleading team, is jealous of Zed's popularity and makes sure Addison isn't able to meet him. Addison is invited by Zed to attend the zombie party in Zombietown. She attends and has a private moment with Zed in the \\"zombie park\\". Just before the pair can kiss, however, the Zombie Patrol crashes the party and takes away Addison. At home, Dale and his wife Missy, the mayor of Seabrook, find out that she has a new crush and advise her not to do any cheering until they know who it is, not knowing that the crush is a zombie. The next day, Zed shows up on Addison's doorstep looking human. He and Addison leave her house and go on a date, where he admits he's been messing with his Z-band. Addison tells him that it is the others that have to change, not him. On the day of the homecoming game, Bucky finds out about Zed's Z-Band hack and has his followers Stacey, Tracey and Lacey steal Eliza's laptop to hack the Z-Bands. They succeed, resulting in Zed, Eliza, and Bonzo turning \\"full zombie\\" and being taken away by the Zombie Patrol. Most of the cheerleaders, including Addison and Bree, show their sympathy for the zombies at the game. Addison tells the crowd it was Bucky and his followers that led Zed to transform into a full zombie. She then rips off her wig exposing her naturally white hair, which she had hidden due to the residents of Seabrook being against anything different. Bucky eliminates all of the zombie- supporting cheerleaders following the incident. When the cheerleader competition nears, Addison and Bree find Zed and Bonzo trying to stop Eliza from sabotaging the competition, and after Eliza talks with her friends, she realizes that doing so is not the right thing to do. Bucky's team is failing because they do not have enough members, so Zoey, Zed's little sister, tries to get in and help him. At first, Zoey is booed by the crowd, but with help from Addison and Zed, the zombies and cheerleaders come together to make a cheer routine during the Cheer competition. Zed and Addison tell each other they love each other. The zombies and humans reunite with each other via a block party in Zombietown. == Cast == * Milo Manheim as Zed, a zombie who wishes to be on the football team. * Meg Donnelly as Addison, a teenage cheerleader who wears a blonde wig to cover her naturally white hair. * Trevor Tordjman as Bucky, Addison's self-centered cousin who leads the Seabrook High School's cheerleading team. * Kylee Russell as Eliza, a zombie that is friends with Zed. * Carla Jeffery as Bree, an aspiring cheerleader whom Addison befriends. * Kingston Foster as Zoey, Zed's little sister who desires to have a dog since zombies are forbidden to have pets. * James Godfrey as Bonzo, a zombie who is friends with Zed and mostly speaks zombie language that has to be translated by Zed and/or Eliza. * Naomi Snieckus as Ms. Lee, the principal of Seabrook High School. * Jonathan Langdon as Coach, the unnamed coach of the Seabrook High School's football team. * Paul Hopkins as Dale, Addison's father who is the Chief of the Zombie Patrol. * Marie Ward as Missy, Addison's mom who is the mayor of Seabrook. * Tony Nappo as Zevon, Zed and Zoey's father. * Emilia McCarthy as Lacey, a female cheerleader that is friends with Bucky and a member of the Aceys. * Mickeey Nguyen as Tracey, a male cheerleader that is friends with Bucky and a member of the Aceys. * Jasmine Renee Thomas as Stacey, a female cheerleader that is friends with Bucky and a member of the Aceys. == Production == The set of Seabrook High School in Toronto, Ontario.

At least 38 people were trapped inside the mall, mostly employees of the market research firm Survey Sampling International (SSI). The probable cause of the fire was faulty electrical wiring due to malpractice of the renovation of the mall's third floor. One body was found a day later, whilst 37 others were found on Christmas day. On December 27, the remains of a security guard who rescued 783 people from the mall was also found. The mall was nearly burnt down and the remaining structure was demolished due to safety concerns. ==Background== NCCC mall before fire incident The New City Commercial Center Mall Davao was a shopping mall located on the corner of MacArthur Highway and Ma-a Road in Davao City, Philippines. It was operated by the New City Commercial Corporation, which was owned by Chinese businessman Lim Tian Siu and his family. The mall opened in December 2003 as the largest project of the corporation. It was the corporation's second mall, after opening one in Tagum, Davao del Norte. The incident was not the first time a fire struck the corporation's projects. In September 2013, a fire burned an NCCC mall in Puerto Princesa, Palawan. Furthermore, it was not the first time the Lim family was affected by a fire incident. In 1952, the family established a textile business after relocating to Davao City, but was destroyed by fire. ==Fire== The fire started on the morning of Saturday, December 23, 2017. The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) reported that the fire started at around 9:30 a.m. PST (UTC+8). NCCC marketing manager Janna Abdullah Mutalib said that the fire started at the mall's third floor where the textiles (which were the materials that are flammable and cause the fire to get worse), school supplies and furniture were sold. At that time, the establishments were still closed to the public, except for the grocery store and the SSI office (located at the fourth floor, above where the fire started). The BFP's regional office in Davao received a radio call at 10:05 a.m. PST with the first units arriving at the scene six minutes later and at the same time, some parts of the mall began to fall apart (eventually, the logo of mall was burned as well) due to the intense heat of the fire. At least six people rescued were treated at the Southern Philippines Medical Center for unspecified injuries. By 5 p.m. PST, the fire disseminated to other parts of the mall. About two hours later, parts of the floor began to collapse due to the severity of the fire. BFP director for Southern Mindanao, Wilberto Kwan Tiu, who was the ground commander for the fire incident, said that 31 fire engines in total were deployed. He said that firefighters could not destroy parts of the building as it would have agitated the flames due to oxygen combustion. Instead, a fire protection engineering process called horizontal ventilation was used to allow the smoke to escape horizontally without extremely damaging the building. This allowed firefighters and other responders to slowly enter the building. Firefighters who had attempted to enter the building were forced to retreat as temperatures reached between 500 and 700¬∞C, which was enough to liquefy equipment and gears. The relatives of occupants trapped inside the mall were situated at a restaurant across the mall. At this time, it was reported that 37 people were still trapped inside the building (later clarified to be 38), all of whom except for one were employees of the market research firm Survey Sampling International. At around 9:30 p.m. PST, approximately 12 hours after the fire started, President Rodrigo Duterte, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte, Davao Archbishop Romulo Valles, and other officials arrived at the scene and met with the relatives as firefighting continued. By the end of the day, the fire was still out of control. On the morning of Christmas Eve, December 24, after receiving updates from members of the rescue units on the condition of the fire, President Duterte announced that those trapped inside the mall had a \\"zero chance of survival.\\" At 5:15 p.m. PST, about 32 hours since the fire started, the BFP declared \\"fire out\\". Survivors of the incident have detailed their experiences on social media, which were collected by the Business Process Outsourcing Industry Employees Network (BIEN), a labor union representing business process outsourcing (BPO) workers in the Philippines. One survivor claimed that the emergency exits were impassable, while several others said that safety drills were never conducted. Some survivors also claimed that the mall's fire alarm system was not activated. == Victims == At around 8 a.m. PST, responders were able to recover the remains of the first victim at a restroom near the SSI office. His body was so severely charred that forensic investigators had difficulty identifying him. On Christmas Day, December 25, the bodies of the 37 remaining victims were recovered. The bodies were recovered from the lobby near the stairwell and the elevator. According to Kwan Tiu, the victims were located a few meters away from the stairwell. One of the victims, Melvin Gaa, was a security guard at the mall and a member of the mall's incident response team. During the fire, Gaa helped evacuate an estimated 783 mall goers, including 83 SSI employees. He, at several times, had already exited the building, but re-entered attempting to rescue more people until his death. ==Impact== The NCCC management reported that the mall's 660 employees were left unemployed due to the fire. The management assured their employees that they would continue to receive their salaries and other benefits. The management added that their 192 employees deployed under a contractual agreement called the Bmirck Cooperative may be deployed to other establishments in the city. Government response On December 24, 2017, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte announced that the city's Christmas celebrations would be canceled. On December 25, the Davao City Council decided that the city's remaining peace and order funds will be used to assist the families of the victims. The city had been declared under a state of calamity due to Typhoon Tembin (Vinta). The Davao City government organized a help desk to assist the families of the victims. On December 28, 2017, Labor and Employment Secretary Silvestre Bello III announced that the government would provide worth of assistance to those affected by the incident. Bello detailed that the relatives of the victims would receive from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), along with the Occupational Safety and Health Center and the Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC). In addition, the ECC would provide the relatives with for burial assistance and at least per month as survivorship pension. ==Investigation== On December 26, 2017, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II ordered the DOLE and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct separate investigations into the incident. Aguirre instructed the NBI to determine possible criminal liabilities on those responsible. Labor and Employment Secretary Silvestre Bello III tasked the DOLE's regional office to determine whether the mall management violated any occupational safety and health standards. BFP director Wilberto Kwan Tiu said that all 38 victims trapped inside the mall died of suffocation due to the release of toxic chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide (which was produced by the carpets and plastics) and carbon monoxide by the fire. Kwan Tiu said that the BFP will investigate the cause of the fire. Davao City fire marshal Honeyfritz Alagano said that the mall had insufficient ventilation and that all the emergency exits in the mall were operational, except for the one in the fourth floor where the SSI office was located. Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte said that a third party investigator would represent the families of the victims, which was supported by the city government. She added that a multiagency task force led by the Department of Interior and Local Government called the Interagency Anti-Arson Task Force (IAATF) would investigate the incident. On December 28, 2017, Duterte declared that the NCCC mall was \\"fire safety compliant\\". Alagano confirmed that the mall contained the necessary fire safety requirements, such as a fire alarm system, a fire sprinkler system, and emergency exits. However, she could not confirm whether these systems were inoperative at the time of the incident, as reported by some survivors. NCCC's spokesperson Thea Padua said that the mall was inspected by fire officials annually in order to renew its business permit. Padua added that safety drills were conducted in the mall quarterly, the last one occurring on July 14, 2017. On December 29, 2017, the IAATF deduced that the mall's emergency exits, which were inside the building, failed to meet certain requirements. IAATF investigator Jerry Candido said that the law requires interior emergency exits to be enclosed in order to prevent the entry of smoke. However, the IAATF discovered that the mall's interior emergency exits contained openings which allowed smoke to enter. The IAATF also discovered that the fire alarm system at the SSI office was defective, compatible to allegations made by some survivors which the NCCC management had denied. In addition, the fire alarm system at the SSI office was not connected to the NCCC's system. The IAATF later discovered that the mall's automatic fire suppression system did not function in the third and fourth floors as the valves of the fire sprinkler system were closed. The IAATF cited these loopholes as the reason for the failure of the victims to escape the building. On January 10, 2018, charges were filed against eight BFP personnel from the Davao City Fire District for issuing a fire safety inspection certificate for the NCCC mall despite it failing to meet certain requirements of the Philippine fire code. On December 19, 2018, almost a year later after the incident, charges against NCCC management and SSI were dropped; the IAATF has found insufficient evidence to file charges against any executives of the AC Rockport Construction and Development that handled the renovation of the mall's third floor. The task force has found that there was no malpractice in the installation of electrical wirings during the renovation at the third floor, which probably hasn't caused an electrical fire. Moreover, there was absence of appropriate license of some workers performing electrical works; and absence of building permit during renovation. The charges against the said executives were withdrawn after families of the victims filed \\"affidavits of desistance,\\" which was received later that year. ==Reactions== Domestic President Rodrigo Duterte consoles the relatives of one of the victims, December 24, 2017 On the evening of December 23, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte paid an unannounced visit to the families of the victims trapped inside the mall. He consoled them upon the announcement that the victims may have a \\"zero chance of survival.\\" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque assured the families that the government would extend assistance. Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III offered his condolences to the victims. Pimentel urged the BFP to thoroughly investigate the incident. Several labor unions criticized the government, particularly the DOLE, for their negligence in maintaining safe workplaces. The Federation of Free Workers (FFW) called on the DOLE, as well as the BFP and local government officials, to explain the fire. The FFW offered to send their safety officers to investigate the incident. BIEN labeled the incident as a \\"massacre of working people who strive hard to earn a living.\\" BIEN claimed that safety drills are not conducted in BPO companies due to the unwanted suspension of operations. The Institute for Occupational Health and Safety Development (IOHSD) demanded the immediate release of investigation results. The IOHSD also advocated for the creation of new laws that would penalize companies that violate occupational safety and health standards, which BIEN expressed support for. The Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP) believed that a \\"routine and objective\\" inspection of the mall by the DOLE could have reduced the impact of such fire to property. The ALU-TUCP also criticized the management of SSI, the firm that employed 37 of the 38 victims, for failing to comply with the labor inspection standards on fire protection. International SSI issued a statement confirming that 37 victims were employees of the firm. SSI CEO Gary Laben announced that the firm will arrange counseling for its employees and will assist in the funeral arrangements for the victims. Laben added that a fund will be created to assist the families of the victims. Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe offered his condolences to the victims. Abe added that Japan is willing to provide assistance. On December 27, 2017, Mayor Duterte announced that representatives from the Chinese government would visit Davao City to provide assistance to the families of the victims. These representatives visited Davao City on January 10, 2018 and met with Mayor Duterte. Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua announced that the Chinese government offered to the families of the victims. ==Aftermath== The Bureau of Fire Protection assessed the entire building of the NCCC Mall Davao was totally damaged, except for the ground floor. The upper floors collapsed on top of each other, which made it difficult for firefighters to conduct their search and retrieval operations. As such, it was recommended that the 14-year old mall to be demolished since the building may potentially collapse entirely. NCCC management applied for demolition on February 2, 2018, and commenced on May 19 of the same year after the building had been vacated and all utility lines such as electric, gas, telephone and water installations had been disconnected. As of November 2018, the mall complex has been totally torn down, including the building which housed a McDonald's branch, which was torn down later. The NCCC has stated that there are plans to build a new mall at the site. A high-rise condominium and a newer version of NCCC Mall will take its place, set to be opened in 2021. ==See also== * List of fires * Ozone Disco Club fire ‚Äì worst fire in the Philippines, happened in 1996 ==References== Davao City mall fire Davao City mall fire Davao City mall fire Category:History of Davao City Davao City mall fire ","title":"2017 Davao City mall fire"},{"id":"56123496","text":"Joseph Chukwudi Obidiaso (born 20 September 1992 in Orlu, Imo State) is a Nigerian professional footballer centre forward or Winger, who currently plays for Mesarya Spor Kul√ºbu in the KTFF Super Lig. ==Career== Obidiaso started his career in Nigeria 2004-2006, at Chedeks and moved to Ambek FC.

It is the second tallest building in Taipei (after Taipei 101) and the third tallest building in Taiwan (after Taipei 101 and 85 Sky Tower). As of 2019, it is the 146th-tallest building in Asia and 248th-tallest building in the world. ==Architecture== It was designed by Japanese architecture firm Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei Inc. The height of building is 272 m, the floor area is 192,154.99m2, and it comprises 48 floors above ground, as well as 5 basement levels. The lower level shopping mall is operated by Breeze Center. The architectural plan of Taipei Nan Shan Plaza consists of three parts: a 7-story complex mall, a 48-story tower, and a diamond-shaped entrance building with an open art space. The 272-meter-tall tower is now the second tallest building in Taipei, and will be the highest-ranking office building in East Asia, with the aim of becoming the first choice for multinational companies to set up corporate headquarters. The complex shopping mall is from the 3rd floor to the 7th floor. It will introduce international fashion brands, which are expected to drive the fashion trend of Taipei. The wide and traversable shopping malls ease the dense visuals of skyscrapers in the Xinyi Special District as well as providing an open view for the public. At the same time, the basement will plan 31 parking spaces for buses and large vehicles, in order to effectively solve issues with parking. As for the diamond-type architectural design of Songren Road in the east, considering the requirements of Taipei as a global city, Taipei Nan Shan Plaza includes public art spaces of about 1600m2. After completion, it will be used as an important venue for receiving foreign guests and important ceremonies. The use of fundraising activities can also be provided to public welfare arts and cultural activities or small-scale commercial activities, art exhibitions, etc., which can inject more art and culture into the Xinyi District where financial and commercial gatherings are concentrated. In addition, the surroundings of the tower will be planned with a number of open green public spaces, combined with parks, sidewalks and bicycle lanes, with benches between the mall and the office building Another major feature of Taipei Nan Shan Plaza is that it will connect the surrounding buildings such as Taipei 101, ATT 4 FUN and Vieshow Cinema with underground passages or pedestrian bridges, and connect the core area of Xinyi Business Circle into a three-dimensional pedestrian network. The existing flat walkway and plaza space allow the public to directly transfer from the MRT \\"Taipei 101/World Trade Center\\" via Taipei Nanshan Plaza and the Xinyi Business Circle to the Taipei City Hall Bus Station. It will also cooperate with Taipei 101 after its completion to create an even better New Year's fireworks show. {  !Level !Use - 43 Pfizer - 42 Pfizer - 41 Hoffmann-La Roche - 40 Hoffmann-La Roche - 39 Chanel - 38 VMware - 37 The Executive Centre - 36 Mars Blockchain PTE LTD - 35 Facebook - 34 The Executive Centre - 33 E.SUN Commercial Bank - 32 Apple Taiwan - 31 Apple Taiwan - 30 Dentsu Taiwan - 29 Dentsu Taiwan - 28 BlackRock - 27 Deloitte Consulting (Pacific) Limited - 26 Reuters/LSEG FTSE Russell - 25 Mechanical layer - 24 Mechanical layer - 23 Aifuyue Singapore - 22 Deloitte & Touche - 21 Deloitte & Touche - 20 Deloitte & Touche - 19 Deloitte & Touche - 18 Deloitte & Touche - 17 Deloitte & Touche - 16 Deloitte & Touche - 15 Seiko Epson Taiwan - 14  - 13  - 12 Amazon Taiwan - 11 TSAR & TSAI LAW FIRM - 10 Dentsu Taiwan - 9 Dentsu Taiwan - 8 Dentsu Taiwan - 7 Deloitte & Touche - 6 Mitsubishi Estate Taiwan } == Gallery == File:Looking at Taipei, Taiwan skyline from Fuzhoushan 2016.jpgTaipei Nan Shan Plaza, visible on the right of Taipei 101.

An expansion named Knights of the Isle, based on Scottish and Irish elements, was scheduled for release in April 1996 but never materialized. ==Gameplay== This CCG is based on Arthurian legend, with elements of Monty Python (although it preceded the Monty Python and the Holy Grail CCG released in June 1996.) Each player divides their cards into two decks: * The Court deck contains Kings, Knights, Rewards, Events, Domains, and Companions. * The Quest Deck has missions and encounters To complete a quest, each player deploys Knights and Kings to search for equipment and spells that will aid in the quest. Successful completion of a Quest earns Valor points. Any knight or King who earn 12 or more Valor may attempt to find the Grail by completing three Quests in the same turn, winning the game. ==Reception== In the December 1995 edition of Arcane (Issue 1), Lucya Szachnowski was generally positive about the game, saying, \\"This game brims with atmosphere.

The Experiment Works existed from 1872 to 1977 and for most of its history was based at the Haslar Gunboat Yard in Gosport, South Hampshire. It ceased independent operations in 1977, merging with the Admiralty Marine Technology Establishment and ultimately with the Defence Research Agency in the Ministry of Defence. ==History== The Admiralty Experiment Works (AEW) was founded at Chelston Cross, Torquay, in 1872. It was Admiralty's first research establishment, and was initially structured around experimental work by engineer and naval architect William Froude, concerning methods to accelerate vessel propulsion. The Establishment was administered by the Director of Naval Construction, reporting to the Third Sea Lord in his capacity as Controller of the Navy. By 1886 its focus centered on the model testing of ship's hulls, and a year later was relocated to wat would become its permanent home at the Haslar Gunboat Yard. At Haslar, research again shifted to focus on predictions of ship power, hydrodynamics, submarine design and later propeller design in relation to ship manoeuvrability and seakeeping. As its work began to expand, new research testing facilities were established between 1930-1972 that enabled the works to extend their tests on models in a ship tank covering all classes of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines and miscellaneous vessels. The results of these experiments were then used by Naval Construction Department enabling it to improve ship design and performance. In 1958 the functions of the Director of Naval Construction became a division of the new Ship Department. In 1977, AEW became part of the Admiralty Marine Technology Establishment, which itself in 1984 became a department of the unified Admiralty Research Establishment. ==Timeline== * Board of Admiralty, Admiralty Experiment Works (AEW), (1872-1964) * Ministry of Defence, Admiralty Experiment Works (AEW), (1964-1977) * Ministry of Defence, Admiralty Marine Technology Establishment (AMTE), (1977-1984) * Ministry of Defence, Admiralty Research Establishment (ARE), (1984-1991) * Ministry of Defence, Defence Research Agency, (1991-1995) ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Admiralty departments Category:Admiralty during World War I Category:Admiralty during World War II Category:Ministry of Defence Navy Department Category:1872 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1977 disestablishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Admiralty Experiment Works"},{"id":"56123693","text":"Us/Them (; ) is a 2014 play by Belgian writer about the Beslan school siege. It uses two actors and is one hour long. , a Brussels-based company, produces Us/Them. Wijs stated that the play \\"is an attempt to talk about something that is supposed to be an impossible subject for children. It‚Äôs an attempt to talk about it to everyone, actually.\\"\\"In conversation with Us/Them director Carly Wijs.\\" Royal National Theatre Official Tumblr. Retrieved on December 25, 2017. Rosemary Waugh wrote in Exeunt Magazine that the play's title suggested that \\"the relationship between different groups\\" is its most important theme. In Dutch-speaking Belgium the play was rated for ages nine and above, while in London the play was rated for ages twelve and above. ==Background== Wijs, from Brussels, noted that her son reacted to the news coverage of the Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya in a manner she described as \\"matter- of-fact, very distanced way\\", differing from \\"the emotional way an adult would react to such news.\\" Wijs watched the BBC documentary Children of Beslan and noted the interview subjects, all children who survived the Beslan incident, reacted in manners similar to that of her child. She decided to make a play for children about Beslan. Wijs used her own son as a barometer for making the play, and she believed she was more courageous in writing the play as she was not accustomed to writing for children. ==Contents== The actors play a boy character and a girl character; both do not have their names stated. Within the play the characters portray other people, but otherwise nobody else is present. The stage design represents the school and gymnasium, including the wires that were used to hold the bombs. The effect of explosions is simulated with balloon pops. In the beginning the boy and girl try to recreate a map of Beslan and their school, but have trouble as they do not remember things the same way. Afterwards the actors set up the depiction of the gymnasium where the hostages were held. The play portrays the first day of school, the hostage-taking, and the captivity in the gymnasium. The play depicts a hoped- for alternative ending where the children's fathers rescue them, but this does not happen and the children's hopes fade. The hopeful alternative ending uses music from Mission: Impossible. \\\\- Original French version: \\"\\"Wij/Zij\\" parle de terrorisme aux enfants\\" (PDF version), Dutch version: \\"‚ÄúWij/Zij‚Äù vertelt kinderen over terrorisme\\") In the true ending the actors portray the removal of bodies, including that of a girl who wished to become famous on television and gets fame post-mortem. During the removal of the girl, the media misrepresents a woman who sneezes as a woman who is crying. Claire Allfree of The Daily Telegraph stated that despite the knowledge that negative events will occur later, \\"this often very funny piece consistently and cleverly frustrates that expectation\\" since the characters \\"deflect the enormity of what is happening with curiosity and laughter.\\" ==Production== The play first opened in 2014. As of 2017 all productions in all languages used Wijs as the director and Flemish Belgian actors Roman van Houtven and Gytha Parmentier. In Belgium it was performed in Dutch and French. In addition to Belgium, the play was performed in France and the United Kingdom. In the UK it debuted at the Edinburgh Festival and was later performed at the Royal National Theatre in London. ==Reception== In Dutch-speaking Belgium there were, compared to the United Kingdom, more relaxed ideas regarding content for children's theatre; despite this, initially there were concerns at some theatres that families would be turned off by the subject matter. The summer 2016 performance at the Edinburgh Festival sold out. Susannah Clapp of The Observer ranked the play three of five stars. Lyn Gardner of The Guardian ranked the 2016 Edinburgh performance five of five stars. Allfree gave the 2017 London performance four of five stars. David Pollock of The Scotsman ranked the 2016 Edinburgh performance four of five stars, as did Allan Radcliffe of The Times.

Padmavathi is an irresponsible woman who neglects family life and goes to clubs and parties. To make things worse, she makes Chitra accustomed to this lifestyle. As a result, Chitra falls for a wrong man Ramesh (Haranath), gets pregnant and commits suicide when she gets cheated. Sekhar gets shattered with his sister's unfortunate demise and becomes a heavy drunkard in the rice mill where he works. He roams around with fellow industry workers in search of affection and love.

He was born in a family of four children, one brother and two sisters. ==Education and career== He went to Narok school in Narok in 1926, at that time, parents of the students were giving out cows to the school to provide milk. His father went to school to be with him due to his young age. Eventually, the school employed Daudi's father as a casual worker, where he learned how to read and write. In 1952, Reverend Daudi attended a Divinity school in Limuru, today known as Limuru school of theology. While in divinity school, reverend Mokinyo worked with reverent Manasses Kuria for one year. In 1951 he was ordained as a deacon at all Saints Cathedral in Nairobi. He was posted to Emmanuel church in Kajiado. He went back to college after one year, and graduated in 1954, after which he was ordained in 1955 at Emmanuel church. ==Career== After completing school, he started working in Kajiado as a veterinary officer, while at the same time, preached in the evenings. He's favorite spot was on a rock close to the present Kajiado railway station. Later on, this was the place where the first church made out of grass was built. After a while of working and preaching, he was called to preach in Nairobi, so he stopped working for the government, and started working for God. Rev. Mokinyo took the train to Konza, Kenya and walked to Nairobi from there while spreading and teaching the word of God. Upon arriving to Nairobi, he was employed as a preacher, and was given the mandate to oversee preaching in Maasai land and part of Kambaland. He had to walk on foot in the Maasai land and kambaland spreading the word. After working there for some time he was posted to Thika for three years. After that, he was sent back to work in Nairobi in 1944. He worked in Pumwani under Reverend Pitway of Nairobi diocese and Mr. Colonel Elijah Gachanja. In 1943 Reverend Daudi was sent to Maasai land because there was no preacher over there due to the high number of lions and water shortage. ==Bringing change and Christianity to Maasai land== Reverend Mokinyo build the first church in Kajiado at around 1944, the church was located next to the present day maasai store (Shopping centre in Kajiado). During this time, the construction of Emanuel church was underway as he continued spreading the gospel. He got an offer from the D.C to become the Maasai District Officer, but turned it down because he was already dedicated to working for God. Reverend Mokinyo was offered some other work opportunities while he spread the Gospel, jobs such as a Maasai store clerk and working for Kenya Marble Quarry(KMQ) company, but he also turned them down for the same reason. Additionally, in 1952, the Magadi Soda Company gave him a permit to transport firewood and sand, however, he delegated the job to his brother Mr Maora, who worked with around 300 men, most of them from the tribe of Watende in Tanzania and the Kamba from Kenya. Mr. Maora went on to become a headman in his work field, then later he became chief, and afterwards the Paramount chief. In 1957, he acquired a farm in Maasai land (loodokilani). Apart from the scarcity of water, the place was also known for the high number of lions. However, he concurred this and other challenges and went on to drill the first motorised borehole in Kajiado and Narok Districts. The commencement of the borehole's operation was marked by a great fest, where the attendees ate meat and drank refreshments. The ceremony was attended by the European D.C, Chief Nititoyian Ole Sayianka, the headmaster of REB school (now known as Ol-Kejuado High school), the students and Mr. Wiliam Ole Ndimama. Reverend Mokinyo is still remembered up to date for the massive milk distribution industry that he had in Kajiado. He introduced the Sahiwal cattle in maasai land in 1956 and cross bread them with Freshian cattle to increase milk production, this enabled him to solely supply milk to Ol-Kejuado High School, Kajiado district hospital and individual customers. After some time, he built a dip for his cattle and piped water to his home which was around six km from his borehole. The reverend continued evangelising and overseeing evangelism in Kajiado district, some parts of Machakos district (Ukea, Kilome) as well as the border between the Kamba and the Maasai tribe. During this period, he worked with Bishop Leonard Bencheer. The coming of the Anglican church from England coincided with the period when the reverend was very active at work, Isinya centre was among the first to receive aid from Queen Elizabeth II. Later on, with his help, the church spread throughout Maasai land to places like Okiramatia, Olitasika, Torosei and Meto. In 1965, he started working with reverent John T. Mpaayei, some Samburu elders and some Tanzanians from Arusha to translate the Bible to Maa (Maasai language), however, he passed away before the translation was complete. ==Highlights== While working in Kajiado office as a veterinary assistant, he and his colleagues went to Esokota (a small town deep in Maasai land) for work and were attacked by lions, He speared the lion but it locked jaws on his hand. His colleagues sought help from the DC,s office who came to his rescue and killed the lion which had hurt him badly. The journey from Konza to Nairobi was not very smooth, he recalls the burning hunger and the scorching sun, he said that he sat next to the railway line under a tree, he took a loaf of bread and some water and continued with the journey. While he was rearing his Sahiwal cattle at the Oletepesi ranch in 1956 he managed to legally acquire a gun, and at one point the lions around his home were terrorising the locals, such that no one was able to walk around at 3pm, the lions killed cattle all the time. Therefore, he shot dead four Lions, and the rest fled. The news about the dead Lions did not go so well with the assistant game warden, who confiscated his weapons. However, he later won the case in a Ngong court, and his weapons given back to him, he was highly praised by the maasai people as a brave person and was nicknamed Pastor Daudi, the Lion of Judah. ==Final days== In 1980, the reverend took all his family to a spot about 100 yards from his home, where he will be buried when he passes on, he said that he chose that place because it was not very rocky, and he did not want to give his family a lot of work digging his grave. He also demanded that he should be buried without a coffin, quoting Ecclesiastes 3:20 (all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.), however, he was later convinced that a coffin must be used, he agreed but instructed that the coffin must be open. The reverend died on July 19, 1982 due to chest complications. ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Anglican Church of Kenya clergy Category:Kenyan activists Category:Kenyan evangelicals Category:Maasai people Category:People from Narok County ","title":"H.

Sharma resides in the Executive Director's Residence in NABI Campus at Knowledge City in Mohali, Punjab. == Legacy == Sharma's research has been focusing the fields of genomics and plant disease resistance and he has worked on the crop improvement of rice. His work on rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae fungus led to the identification of Pi54 (Pi-kh) gene which showed resistance to the disease and he was successful in cloning the gene from Indica Rice Line Tetep using positional cloning technique. He developed new DNA markers namely SSR, STMS and SNP and isolated Pi54rh and Pi54of, two new alleles, from wild rice which showed resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. Working on the sheath blight disease of rice caused by Rhizoctonia solani, the team led by him mapped a new gene, QTL qSBR11-1, which helped in the development of disease resistant rice varieties such as Pusa Basmati 1637 and HPR 2880. The development of a new cloning protocol for Avr-Pi54 gene from Magnaporthe oryzae as well as sequencing techniques of genes of rice, tomato, pigeon pea, Magnaporthe, and Puccinia were some of his other contributions. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 77 of them. He also holds six Indian patents for the processes he has developed. Sharma is the chief editor of the Journal of Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology of Springer Media and sits in the editorial board of the Biotech Today journal. He is a life member of several scientific societies including the Biotechnology Society of India, the Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology, the Association for the Promotion of DNA Fingerprinting and other DNA Technologies (APDFDT) and the Indian Phytopathological Society. Besides, he has mentored many post-graduate and doctoral research scholars in their studies and has delivered plenary or invited speeches at seminars which included the lecture on a lecture on ‚ÄòCloning and Characterization of Genes and their Application in Rice Improvements - A Success Story, delivered as a part of the NAAS lecture series at Punjab Agricultural University campus on 1 March 2017. == Awards and honors == Sharma received the Young Scientist Award of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1998 and the Young Scientist Award of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research the next year. In 2001, he was selected for the Professor Umakant Sinha Memorial Award of the Indian Science Congress Association and two years later, he received the 2003 International Technology Award of the World Technology Network.

Steroidal 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors Steroid 5Œ±-reductase is a membrane-associated enzyme in an oxidoreductase family and has an important role in biological actions towards steroid metabolism. If the steroid 5Œ±-reductase is overexpressed it causes overproduction of DHT that can lead to androgenic disorders in humans. The 5Œ±-reductase isozymes possess a similar steroidal catalytic site. The only available information about the 5Œ±-reductase isozymes is their primary sequence estimated from c-DNAs and that affects the design of the novel inhibitors. The crystal structure of the 5Œ±-reductase isozymes is not known because the nature of the 5Œ±-reductase enzyme is so unstable during purification. The first 5-ARIs were designed by modifying the structure of natural substrates, including the substitution of one carbon atom of the rings of the steroids by a heteroatom such as nitrogen thereby forming azasteroids. The receptor is known to consist of two hydrogen bond donors, where the C3 and 17Œ≤-side chain of the ligands connect, as well as three hydrophobic groups distributed over the steroidal structure. The best receptor inhibitors comply with these factors. Azasteroids are a type of steroid derivatives which have nitrogen atoms replaced at various positions for one of the carbon atoms in the steroid ring system. Two 4-azasteroids, finasteride and dutasteride are marketed as 5-ARIs. Finasteride (Proscar or Propecia) was the first steroidal 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). It inhibits the function of two of the isoenzymes (type II and III). In human it decreases the prostatic DHT level by 70‚Äì90% and reduces the prostatic size. Dutasteride (Avodart) was the second steroidal 5Œ±-reductase approved after finasteride. It is a competitive inhibitor of all three 5Œ±-reductase isoenzymes and it inhibits types 1 and 2 better than finasteride, leading to it causing further reduction in DHT, with >90% recuded DHT levels following 1 year of oral administration. Epristeride is the third marketed steroidal 5-ARI. It is a noncompetitive, specific inhibitor. It potency is not as significant as finasteride or dutasteride and thus it is only marketed in China. Nonsteroidal 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors Various pharmaceutical and academic groups have conducted the synthesis of nonsteroidal compounds that inhibit human 5Œ±-reductases due to the unwanted hormonal side effects of steroidal compounds. Nonsteroidal inhibitors can be categorized due to their structure. Many have been obtained from azasteroid inhibitors by taking away one or more rings from the steroid structure. Four main categories of nonsteroidal 5-ARIs have been described: * Benzo(c)quinolizinones * Benzo(f)quinolonone * Piperidones * Carboxylic acids Nonsteroidal inhibitors are thought to act as competitive inhibitors on the 5Œ±-reductase isozymes, except for epristeride analogues (carboxylic acids), which are noncompetitive inhibitors. Bexlosteride falls into the category of benzo(f)quinolonones, and is probably the derivative that has come closest to being marketed. It functions as a 5-ARI1 inhibitor which inhibits testosterone stimulated LNCaP cell growth but without testosterone the compound shows no effect and was therefore never marketed. ==Structure‚Äìactivity relationships== 4-Azasteroids Many steroidal 5-ARIs have been researched but only 3 are marketed. Two of them are 4-azasteroids and will be covered here. As mentioned above, the third one, epristeride is only marketed in China and will not be covered here. The basic SAR of 4-azasteroids is shown below. For competitive inhibiting functions there are two functions considered crucial, 4-en-3-one function and a lipophilic 17Œ≤-side chain with one or more oxygen atoms. The main problems for 4-azasteroids is the rapid conversion into inactive 4,5-dihydro form, which is done by the enzyme. Basic SAR of 4-azasteroids Finasteride is considered similar to the transition state of reduced testosterone and is thus a slow-offset, irreversible inhibitor. The similarity to the transition state is a formation of an enzyme-NADP-dihydrofinasteride adduct by rearrangement on the A-ring of the compound. Structure of finasteride Finasteride mainly inhibits the 5Œ±-R2 (IC50=69 nM) and 5Œ±-R3 (IC50=17.4 nM) with little inhibition of 5Œ±-R1 (IC50=360 nM). As mentioned above, finasteride reduces prostatic DHT levels on a 70-90% range but the detailed reduction of DHT is 70.8% and 85% of intraprostatic DHT. Dutasteride, however, is a so-called dual inhibitor with both 5Œ±-R1 and 5Œ±-R2 inhibition. IC50 for 5Œ±-R1 is 7 nM but 6 nM for 5Œ±-R2. As mentioned above, it reduces DHT > 90% overall, or precisely 94.7% and for intraprostatic DHT the reduction is 97-99%. Dutasteride has also been found to inhibit 5Œ±-R3, in vitro, with IC50=0.33 nM. The 2,5-difluorophenyl side chain on the D-ring of the compound shows significant lipophilic features and as increased lipophilicity enhances the potency of the compounds binding at pocket site, its potency is much greater than of finasteride. Structure of 4-MA Finasteride is an unsaturated analogue of another 4-azasteroid, or 4-MA. 4-MA is known to have dual inhibiting features with good inhibition on 5Œ±-R1 (IC50=1.7 nM) and 5Œ±-R2 (IC50=1.9 nM). However, 4-MA was never marketed as it showed hepatotoxicity. There is no detailed data about the cause of hepatotoxicity in 4-MA regarding SAR, but a conclusion may be drawn that the R2 group is the cause as there are other 4-azasteroid compounds containing the same R1 group as 4-MA, or CH3, without showing hepatotoxicity. Nonsteroidal The common factor in nonsteroidal 5-ARI discovery is that the first compounds were all selective inhibitors to 5Œ±-reductase type 1 only, but were then developed in order to get dual inhibition on both type 1 and 2, since inhibition of the type 2 isozyme is a more important factor in treating the disease of BPH. Benzo(c)quinolizinones are tricyclic derivatives of 10-azasteroids. The D-ring has been removed and the C-ring substituted for an aromatic one. The first compounds developed were selective 5-alpha reductase type 1 inhibitors, but the most potent one inhibits both type 1 and 2. The fluorine atom is an important part of the structure. Benzo(f)quinolonone are also tricyclic compounds, but derivatives of the 4-azasteroid structure. The compounds that have been designed can be divided into two categories, hexahydro derivatives and octahydro derivatives. The octahydro derivatives have been proven to be more potent. Compound LY 191704, later named bexlosteride, is the most potent octahydro derivative designed. It is a selective inhibitor to the type 1 isozyme, especially because of the chlorine atom and the amino-methyl group. Structure of center Piperidones are also 4-azasteroid derivatives but both B- and D-ring have been removed. The original compounds designed were type 1 selective, especially the ones containing a chlorine atom connected to the aromatic ring. By inserting a styryl group to the piperidones type 2 inhibitory activity increased. Nonsteroidal carboxylic acids are tricyclic compounds designed to resemble steroidal carboxylic acids such as episteride. As with the other nonsteroidal inhibitors, they have been designed by removing steroid ring systems. As with the piperidones, addition of a styryl group provides good dual inhibition on isozyme 1 and 2, but the nonsteroidal carboxylic acids are mostly type 1 selective. Carboxylic acid derivative and piperidone derivative ==Natural products== Serenoa repens (saw palmetto). Saw palmetto extract The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has concluded that the extract of the natural product Saw palmetto can be used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as research has shown its 5-ARI effects. An extract of Serenoa repens, also known as saw palmetto extract, is a 5-ARI that is sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. It is also used under the brand name Permixon in Europe as a pharmaceutical drug for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. ==See also== * Discovery and development of antiandrogens * List of 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors ==References== Category:5Œ±-Reductase inhibitors Category:Drug discovery ","title":"Discovery and development of 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors"},{"id":"56124207","text":"Carew & Co (Bangladesh) Ltd is a distillery producing alcohol made from sugar cane in Bangladesh and is located in Darshana, Chuadanga, Khulna Division, Bangladesh.

One won the Second National Lightplane Contest, with another coming fifth. ==Design and development== Following their experience with the Dzia≈Çowski D.K.D.3 at the first National Lightplane Contest in 1927, the Dzia≈Çowski brothers, Stanis≈Çaw and Mieczys≈Çaw, set about designing and funding their entrant to the following year's competition. Several established Polish aircraft companies offered both easy terms for purchase of material and free assembly and both the Krak√≥w branch of LOPP and the Krak√≥w Aeroclub agreed to buy an example. LOPP decided to use a Anzani 6 six-cylinder radial engine, the Dzia≈Çowskis' original choice, but the Aeroclub selected a , five cylinder Siemens-Halske Sh 4 radial. The latter was initially designated D.K.D.5, soon revised to D.K.D.4bis. The D.K.D.4 was a two-seat parasol monoplane with a three part, wooden, two spar, fabric covered wing which was trapezoidal in plan. The central section was mounted on two outward-leaning pairs of steel cabane struts from the upper fuselage, one to each spar and each outer panel was braced to the lower fuselage longerons with a pair of steel struts to the spars. Its wingtip ailerons were short and broad. There was a large semi- circular cut-out in the central trailing edge to ease cockpit access and enhance the upward field of view. Its fuselage was similar to that of the D.K.D.3, which had a welded steel tube girder structure with wooden frames, stringers and fabric covering, producing an oval cross-section apart from a flat underside. The radial engines of both versions were mounted with their cylinders exposed but otherwise under a duralumin cowling. The D.K.D.4's empennage was conventional and tidier than that of its predecessor. Its trapezoidal horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage and its similarly shaped fin mounted a rectangular, unbalanced rudder which reached down to the keel, working in a cut-out between the elevators. Their steel tube structure was fabric covered. Larger area, balanced rudders area were added to both examples in late 1929, together with larger ailerons. The prototypes had simple, single axle, fixed landing gear with two V-struts with a bracing crossbar between their vertices, though the sole production example dispensed with the crossbar. The D.K.D.4 and the 4bis both made their first flights in September 1928. This gave time for trials and development before the second National Lightplane Contest, which started on 29 October with twelve contestants. The contest was won by the D.K.D.4, piloted by Jozef Bargiel and the D.K.D.4bis, piloted by Karczmarczyk, came fifth. The D.K.D.3, flown by its designer, came third. The D.K.D.4's success in the Contest brought military interest in it as a trainer and an order for twenty-five was provisionally agreed. The Dzia≈Çowski brothers set up a company, Bracia Dzia≈Çowski, to manufacture them but the government failed to ratify the contract and only one production D.K.D.4 was completed. It had an active career, flying in contests and meetings with some success. The later D.K.D.5 was a fully aerobatic and final development of the D.K.D.4 design. It was powered by a Cirrus III four cylinder upright air-cooled inline engine mounted exposed. An aerodynamic clean-up included a divided undercarriage with cranked axles and a long oleo strut from the outer axle to the upper longeron on each side. Its wings were foldable and their span and area were 11% greater than the D.K.D.4. It first flew in July 1930, piloted by its designer. Despite a slight increase in weight over the D.K.D.4bis, the large increase of power and the clean-up raised its maximum speed to , gave it a ceiling of and enabled it to reach in six minutes. The D.K.D.5 did not reach the Warsaw Second International Tourism Challenge as it was badly damaged in an emergency landing after a fuel pipe broke during its flight to Warsaw. It was rebuilt and operated by the Krak√≥w Aeroclub and competed in competitions and rallies. ==Variants== ;W.K.D.4: LOPP example plus sole production airframe with Anzani 6 radial engine. ;W.K.D.4bis: Krak√≥w Aeroclub example with Siemens-Halske Sh 4 radial engine. ;W.K.D.5: Cleaned-up airframe with divided undercarriage and Cirrus III inline engine. ==Specifications (D.K.D.4bis) References== Category:Parasol-wing aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:1920s Polish sport aircraft ","title":"Dzia≈Çowski D.K.D.4"},{"id":"56124342","text":"Thomas Patrick Ward (born 15 May 1994) is a British professional boxer.

Some variants produce their pendant white flowers in autumn, others in winter and early spring. It is cultivated as ornamental bulbous plant, preferring warmer situations in the garden than other species of Galanthus (snowdrops). ==Description== Galanthus reginae-olgae has revolute leaves that are dark green with a central silver line and when fully grown are 11‚Äì15 cm long by 3‚Äì8 mm wide. Its flowers have three larger outer tepals, pure white, and three smaller inner tepals, white with variable green markings near the tips. The outer tepals are about 15‚Äì35 cm long, the inner ones 9‚Äì12 mm long. Populations of Galanthus reginae-olgae that flower at different times, with or without the leaves being fully developed, have been described as separate species or subspecies. Those described as G. reginae-olgae subsp. reginae-olgae flower in the autumn, either before the leaves develop or with the leaves. Those described as G. reginae-olgae subsp. vernalis flower in late winter or early spring, with the leaves. File:Galanthus reginae-olgae close-up flower.jpgFlower with quite large green markings File:Galanthus reginae-olgae closeup leaves.jpgLeaves File:Galanthus reginae-olgae 91Q03.jpgFlowering in autumn without leaves (in cultivation) ==Taxonomy== Galanthus reginae-olgae was first described in 1876 by Theodoros G. Orphanides. The epithet reginae- olgae means 'of Queen Olga'; Olga Constantinovna of Russia was then Queen of Greece. The species (or when divided into subspecies, its autonymous subspecies) has been treated as Galanthus nivalis subsp. reginae-olgae. Other regularly used synonyms include G. olgae and G. corcyrensis. The name Galanthus corcyrensis has been particularly used for plants that flower in the autumn with the leaves rather than before them. Subspecies The species has been divided into two subspecies, distinguished by the time of flowering: *Galanthus reginae-olgae subsp. reginae-olgae ‚Äì flowering in autumn *Galanthus reginae-olgae subsp. vernalis Kamari ‚Äì flowering in late winter to spring There is however no sharp division between these two subspecies. ==Distribution and habitat== Galanthus reginae-olgae is native to Sicily and parts of the Balkans, in particular Greece and former Yugoslavia. It is found in relatively dry, shady woodland. ==Cultivation== Galanthus reginae-olgae is cultivated as an ornamental bulbous plant, particularly the autumn-flowering variants. In cultivation, it requires a warmer and sunnier position than most other Galanthus species. The cultivar 'Cambridge', originating from the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, has large green markings on the inner tepals. Galanthus reginae-olgae subsp. reginae-olgae has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==References== Category:Amaryllidoideae Category:Flora of Greece Category:Flora of Sicily Category:Flora of Yugoslavia Category:Plants described in 1876 ","title":"Galanthus reginae-olgae"},{"id":"56124436","text":"Malik Riaz Khan (born; 13 July 1948) is a Pakistani politician hailing from Bannu District. who is currently a member of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly belong to the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F).

Trace Repeat live at Cornerstone in Berkeley, CA. Trace Repeat is a funk and soul band from Oakland, California. __TOC__ == Background == Trace Repeat was founded in early 2015 by co-band leaders Wesley Woo and Zach Hing, drummer Ben Peterson, and ex-member/saxophonist Adam Dietz. The band began as a side project immediately following Woo's first tour to South by Southwest as a solo artist. The remaining band members (Dan Wilson, David Kaiser-Jones, Noah Foley-Beining, and Khrizia Kamille) joined the band after the original four members recorded and shopped around its first early demos in 2015. Founder and co-band leader Zach Hing parted ways with Trace Repeat in August 2018 due to personal differences. The band's recording and touring schedule continued uninterrupted with its five remaining members, and contributions from Zach Parkes (bass), Rei Otsuka (bass), and Shawn Miller (bass). In early 2019 the band officially announced Rei Otsuka as its permanent recording and touring bassist. == Career ==  Kollaboration  Trace Repeat found its first early success in May 2016 after catching the attention of Kollaboration talent scout Lauren Lee, who helped the band reach the final round competition of Kollaboration STAR 2016. After winning Kollaboration‚Äôs regional competition in San Francisco, Trace Repeat had their first break on a national stage with their performance at Kollaboration STAR 2016, sharing the stage with artists like JR Aquino, Paul Dateh, Jane Lui, and Tim DeLaGhetto.  Asian American Empowerment  Following their appearance at Kollaboration STAR, Trace Repeat continued to build momentum with the release of their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in January 2017. The campaign garnered media attention due to its focus on Asian American empowerment and the demasculinization of Asian American men in film and media. According to NBC Asian America, ‚ÄúWhile the band wasn't sure how people would respond to their overtly empowerment-themed campaign, the message resonated. Trace Repeat raised more than $8,000 ‚Äî most of it from strangers ‚Äî and surpassed their goal by more than 50 percent.‚Äù  The Oaktown Sound (2017)  Trace Repeat released their debut album The Oaktown Sound in September 2017. The album‚Äôs first print was released on CD, vinyl, and 3 ¬Ω inch floppy disc. Alternative Press calls the album, ‚Äúintentionally referential to some of the 50s and 60s R&B; you might hear on a James Brown or Ray Charles record. A lot of that high energy James Brown intensity, underscored by that Clyde Stubblefield 'funky drummer' kind of attitude in the rhythm section.‚Äù == Band Members ==  Current Members  * Wesley Woo - voice, guitar * Ben Peterson - drums * Daniel Wilson - tenor, baritone saxophone * Khrizia Kamille - voice, percussion * Maddie Liu - trombone * Rei Otsuka - bass guitar, keys, synth * Zach Thorne - trumpet  Frequent Collaborators  * Brent Elberg - drums, keys * Jeremy Propp - drums * Adam Thomson - bass * Shawn Miller - bass * Zach Parkes - bass * Alex Jimenez - bass * Chris Lundeen - trombone * Lindsay Alexis Smith - trombone * Oscar Villagrana - trumpet * Josh Sherman - trumpet * Devin Hollister - tenor saxophone * Noah Rosen - tenor saxophone * Rocky Mandayam - alto saxophone * Greg Yee - keys * Mario Noche - percussion  Past Collaborators  * Jae Jin - vocal, acoustic guitar * Brendan Dreaper - drums * Cadence Myles - drums * Chris Andersen - trombone * Cierra Davis - drums * Jesse Elkin Rubin - tenor, baritone saxophone * Matt Kelly - trumpet * Will Berg - alto saxophone * Zach Zarcone - drums  Past members  * Adam Dietz - alto saxophone * David Kaiser-Jones - trombone * Ellisa Sun - voice * Heather Michelle - voice * Itoro Udofia - voice * Noah Foley-Beining - drums, keys, cowbell * Zach Hing - voice, guitar, bass * Froilan Vicente - tenor saxophone == References == Category:Funk albums by American artists ","title":"Trace Repeat"},{"id":"56124483","text":"Oakover is a historic building in Shimla, Himchal Pradesh, India.

The resolution condemned the launch and further tightened sanctions on the country, restricting fuel imports and other trade, as well as the ability of North Korean citizens to work abroad. On 24 December, the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the resolution constitutes an act of war. ==Provisions== The resolution has several provisions. It limits the North Korean import of refined petroleum to 500,000 barrels for each 12-month period, starting on 1 January 2018. A ban was also imposed on the export of food, machinery, electrical equipment, earth and stones, wood and vessels from North Korea, and export of industrial equipment, machinery, transportation vehicles and industrial metals to it. Asset freezes were imposed on the North Korean Ministry of People's Armed Forces and banking officials. The UN member states were authorized to \\"seize, inspect, freeze and impound any vessel in their territorial waters\\" found to illicitly supply petroleum to North Korea. The resolution also called for the return of all North Korean nationals earning income abroad, with some humanitarian exceptions, within 24 months. ==Voting rationales== US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that the launch \\"was an unprecedented violation which required an unprecedented response\\" and that \\"further defiance would result in further isolation\\". Permanent Representative of France Fran√ßois Delattre called the resolution \\"a significant step in bolstering action against the provocations\\" of North Korea. Permanent Representative of Egypt Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta said that he had voted in favour of the resolution \\"to maintain the credibility of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which must be binding without discrimination or distinction\\". Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations Kairat Umarov said that \\"the temporary nature of the sanctions must be stressed in order for the measures to have their desired result of bringing about talks\\". ==North Korean reaction== On 24 December 2017, the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that the resolution \\"is tantamount to complete economic blockade of the DPRK\\". The statement defined the resolution \\"as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty\\" of North Korea and \\"an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region\\". According to the statement, the nuclear weapons serve \\"self-defensive deterrence that does not contradict any international law\\" since they were developed \\"in a fair and legitimate way outside of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in order to put an end to the hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the U.S.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org *Fact sheet: UN Security Council Resolution 2397 on North Korea Category:2017 United Nations Security Council resolutions Category:Nuclear program of North Korea Category:United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea Category:2017 in North Korea Category:December 2017 events ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 2397"},{"id":"56124488","text":"Walter O'Neale, D.D. was an Irish Anglican priest in the last decades of the seventeenth century and the first one of the eighteenth., The Episcopal Succession in England, Scotland and Ireland, volume 2, pp. 138‚Äì139.

He is also known by its anglicization as Francis Noel. He was known to the Chinese as Wei Fangji. ==Life== Early life Fran√ßois No√´l was a Fleming born on 18 August 1651 in Hestrud, Hainault, France. He joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) at the age of nineteen on 30 September 1670 in Tournai, which had just been returned to France from the Spanish Netherlands two years before under the terms of the War of Devolution's Treaty of Aachen. He was a teacher of grammar and rhetoric for several years.. He studied theology, mathematics, and astronomy at the University of Douai. In China tomb of Xu Guangqi (d. 1633) in Shanghai's Xujiahui neighborhood China as known to the Jesuits . China as known to the Jesuits . He wanted to join the Japan mission but by this point Christianity (and European visitors generally) had been banned within the Tokugawa shogunate for many years. He nonetheless traveled to Lisbon, Portugal, and left for East Asia in January 1684. His journey was funded by Maria, the duchess of Aveiro. He hoped to get passage to Japan on a Dutch East India Company mission, but in Malacca he was assured by \\"Belgian Catholics from our cities\\" that this was impossible. He debarked at Macao on 9 August 1685, where the return of some shipwrecked Japanese sailors caused him to hope that trade would be resumed; this was fruitless.. He made his vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and the fourth vow of \\"special obedience\\" to the pope on February 2 the next year and, after a final failed attempt to reach Japan, finally formally joined the China mission by September 1687. He is sometimes numbered among the Figurists, the Jesuit missionaries who came to think that Christianity had been the ancient religion of China, brought there by Noah's son Shem. No√´l learned rudimentary Chinese on Macao and traveled to the mainland in 1687. He traveled to Shanghai, then part of Jiangsu and‚Äîat nearby Xujiahui‚Äîthe home of the family of the influential convert Xu Guangqi. After further training, he began his mission on nearby Chongming Island in early October 1688 and reported great success by August 1689: 120 baptized converts in Shanghai, 300 on Chongming, and 800 in regions dependent on Chongming.. From there, he travelled to Huai'an and Nanjing in Jiangsu; Wuhe in Anhui; Nanchang, Ganzhou, Jianchang (now Fuzhou), and Nanfeng in Jiangxi; and Nan'an in Fujian. A 1703 report to the Jesuit General shows that No√´l's work was primarily among the lower and working classes, especially to women and abandoned children, which left open the problem of how to pay for church construction and mission work without resorting to begging for alms in the manner of the Buddhist monks.. First Roman embassy Charles Maigrot's 1693 Mandate, which reopened the Chinese Rites controversy Caspar Castner, No√´l's companion on his 1st embassy to Rome On 9 November 1701,. he was selected‚Äîprobably through the influence of his compatriot, the vice-provincial Antoine Thomas‚Äîto act as the procurator for the China mission in an embassy concerning the Chinese Rites Controversy. He was to argue on behalf of the Jesuits and four Chinese bishops that the Catholic Church should continue to permit the Chinese practice with Confucian and ancestral veneration after their conversion to Christianity. Thomas's letter reached him in Nanchang on the 25th; he left on December 6 and reached Guangzhou on January 1. He was originally to travel with Jos√© Ram√≥n Arx√≥ and Claude de Visdelou, but Arx√≥ suffered accidental delays. Visdelou, meanwhile, was delayed first owing to reticence by the French mission to allow him to leave and then under various pretexts because the visitor Carlo Turcotti (correctly) suspected his position on the question of the rites. Since there was already an English ship ready to sail, Turcotti replaced the pair. with the Bavarian mathematician Caspar Castner, who was already working nearby.. The English ship departed on 14 January 1702 for Macao, which it reached on the 21st and left on the 24th. It traveled to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia), where unbalanced cargo and heavy weather required a 17-day delay. On the journey around the Cape of Good Hope, it was again held up for almost a month because of unfavorable winds. After a 43 day wait on Saint Helena owing to fear of a new European war, the ship passed through two storms to the Azores and through a collision off Calais to London, which it reached on October 4. The Jesuits met and presumably lobbied various ambassadors while in London, as well as the directors of the East India Company. They crossed into France on the 31st, had an audience with Philip V of Spain at Aix, and passed from Marseilles to Genoa on December 15; they finally reached Rome on the 29th or 30th. In Rome, the pair scheduled audiences, lobbied cardinals, prepared their documents, and attended sessions at the Holy Office.. They met Cardinal Fabroni, the secretary of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith on 10 January 1703 and two days later. On the 14th, they gave Fabroni the first round of documents: an overview, a dossier of verified testimony, books by De Rocha and Alenio, and a 1664 anti-Christian pamphlet by Yang Guangxian whose complaints proved that the Jesuits were mentioning Jesus's crucifixion to the Chinese. Some of these were rejected on various grounds, and they were forced to hire a lawyer surnamed Ursaia to present them in the proper format around March. The Franciscan Giovanni Francesco Nicolai da Leonessa had been opposing them before their arrival; on March 10, he was joined by the MEP missionary Artus de Lionne. Despite the No√´l and Castner's efforts negotiating the Roman bureaucracy over the next two years, the voluminous Chinese testimony‚Äîincluding an official pronouncement by the Kangxi Emperor‚Äîon the respectful but not worshipful nature of Chinese veneration, and the pains the Jesuits undertook transmitting it around the French mission in Nanjing (which supposedly intercepted it under orders from Bishop Maigrot),. there is no evidence that the Roman court ever weighed any of the Jesuit evidence. Instead, despite the pope's kind words, the decision had already been reached well ahead of its formal proclamation: Charles-Thomas Maillard de Tournon had been named legate for China and the East Indies on 5 December 1701 with the specific instructions to disallow further practice of Chinese rituals by Christians there;. he was given papal-like supremacy over the clerics there and, on the 27th, consecrated as the titular patriarch of Antioch, making him the notional head of the churches across most of Asia. He left for the Qing Empire aboard the French ship Maurepas on 9 February 1703, only weeks after No√´l's arrival, and disallowed the Jesuit leniency towards to the Malabar rites while he waited out the monsoon season in Pondicherry. By 1704, No√´l and Castner were forbidden from publishing their arguments, although their opponents were printing their treatises in great volume, and correspondence and treatises shipped from China were confiscated at Livorno. No√´l seems to have accepted that there was little to be done or been otherwise occupied for the rest of the year.. Castner continued his lobbying, assisted after 26 February 1704 by Jean-Fran√ßois de P√©lisson, who arrived with further documentation from the Jesuits in China. Aixin-Jueluo Xuanye, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing (18thc.) On November 20, Pope ClementXI's decree ruled almost completely against the Jesuits,. formalizing a ban on both the rites and further discussion of the topic. Christians could not refer to God as (tiƒÅn, \\"Heaven\\" or \\"the sky\\") and their churches could not display the imperial plaque ordering parishioners to \\"Revere Heaven\\" (, J√¨ng TiƒÅn). Tournon was to prepare more detailed regulations to avoid \\"every hint of pagan superstition\\", and the decree was worded legalistically and carefully‚Äî\\"hall or temple\\", \\"sacrifice or offering\\"‚Äîto limit any chance the Jesuits might evade or limit its application.. No√´l returned east in 1706, traveling‚Äîat Castner's insistence‚Äînot via Goa and through the Straits of Malacca but around Timor; this route proved faster and subsequently became standard for journeys between Europe and Macao. They arrived on 22 July 1707, finding the legate Tournon under arrest in Macao and the entire mission in chaos. The sickly Tournon had arrived at Macao in April 1705 and Beijing on December 4,. insisting on the incompatibility of Confucianism and Roman Catholicism. His first imperial audience the same month had been diplomatic and held out hope for permanent relations between China and the Papal States; his second, on 29 June 1706, had found the emperor displeased that any controversy had arisen over the Jesuits' accommodation of rites he had personally verified as secular and, in any case, necessary for Chinese society.. Tournon‚Äîstill generally uninformed on the details of the situation‚Äîhad deferred to the \\"great expert\\" Maigrot, whose analysis had prompted Rome's reversal, and the emperor agreed to receive him at the new summer palace at Jehol (now Chengde).. Maigrot had already been summoned from Fujian and was interviewed on 2 August 1706. Despite having lived in China since 1684, he proved so grossly ignorant‚Äîhe knew only Fuzhounese. and required Dominique Parrenin to translate the emperor's questions; he claimed to have read the Four Books but to not be able to remember two characters from them by heart; he had not even read Matteo Ricci's Chinese catechism; and he could read only one of the four Chinese characters on the plaque behind the emperor's head but presumed to lecture the patron of the Kangxi Dictionary on the permissible meanings of the character ;.‚Äîand stubborn. that he had finally been expelled from the country on December 17 and Christian missionaries required to receive an imperial permit (, pi√†o) attesting to their support of \\"the method of Matteo Ricci\\" and their willingness to remain in China for the rest of their lives.. Finally receiving notice of , Tournon had ordered a summary and automatic excommunication of any Christian permitting Confucian rituals from Nanjing on 25 January 1707; on February 7th, he had further issued instructions concerning the piao examination‚Äîagain on pain of excommunication‚Äîthat precluded its ever being approved. Enraged, the emperor finally had him arrested and deported on June 13,. with the Portuguese then holding him under house arrest for their own reasons.. Second Roman Embassy The Kangxi Emperor's 1716 open letter to ClementXI, inquiring about the fate of his 1706 and 1708 embassies About half of the missionaries then in China joined Maigrot and Tournon in exile.. At the emperor's insistence, a second embassy was dispatched to Rome to overturn and Maigrot and Tournon's various rulings in 1706; this was apparently lost at sea. Unable to secure a residence permit without fear of excommunication, No√´l joined a third embassy. (He has sometimes been said to have been specifically requested by the Kangxi Emperor, although this seems unlikely.) No√´l departed for Europe from Macao on 14 January 1708 on the Portuguese ship Bom Jesus de Mazag√£o das Brotas with the Jesuits Jos√© Ram√≥n Arx√≥ and Ant√≥nio Francesco Giuseppe Provana and the Chinese convert Louis Fan. Traveling via Batavia and Bahia, Brazil, they arrived in Lisbon in September and in Rome by February the next year. En route, he sent a letter ahead to the pope imploring:. Clement supported Tournon completely.. A decree from the Holy Office was issued on 25 September 1710 upholding all of his rules and condemnations. The embassy may have been enjoined from sending the Kangxi Emperor any notice of that fact, since he never learned the fate of either of his embassies; in 1716, he resorted to providing open letters (the \\"Red Manifesto\\") to passing European merchants to try to ascertain their fate. (No√´l, however, was not one of those individually listed for the merchants to search for.) In Europe The Czech National Library, formerly the Clementinum Library of Charles-Ferdinand University, completed in the 1720s No√´l then appears to have moved to Prague, in the Austrian Empire's Kingdom of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). There, he published mathematical and astronomical observations from India and China and lectured on mathematics at the Jesuit-staffed Charles-Ferdinand University. He also published Latin translations of classic Chinese texts and works on Sinology which he had worked over for decades. No√´l's translations were banned in the Papal States and Holy Roman Empire, but were praised by Du Halde in his Description of China.. They were difficult to acquire in France and western Europe but were among the most influential Jesuit works in Germany and eastern Europe,. where they inspired works by Johann Benedikt Carpzov, Wilhelm von Leibnitz, and Christian Wolff, the latter of whom lost his position at the University of Halle because of his immoderate praise of Confucius and admission that the Chinese had been able to distinguish between right and wrong without exposure to Christianity. No√´l's Historical Notices‚Äîwhich aimed to reopen the Chinese rites issue‚Äîdoes not seem to have been formally banned but was almost immediately suppressed. It seems likely that its claimed papal imprimatur was that which Clement had granted to publish findings before his 1704 decision; on 19 March 1715, he issued the bull repeating in stronger terms his condemnations and the incompatibility of Chinese ritual with Catholicism. On June 10 of that year, No√´l sought approval to return to China although he was 64 at the time. He was denied permission.. He died on 17 September 1729 in Lille, France. ==Works== The engraving of Confucius in the 1687 Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese. No√´l's own translations had no illustrations, apart from their floral tailpieces. No√´l published his Mathematical and Physical Observations Made in India and China () at the Charles-Ferdinand University's press in Prague, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), in 1710. No√´l's effort to translate the Chinese classics was a generally scholarly one, aiming to present it more correctly on its own terms than previous Jesuit editions like the Confucius Sinarum Philosophus had, but it was still an exercise undertaken in order to further missionizing among the Chinese. The preface to his Six Chinese Classics ends with the admonition that the reader should bear the Christian life in mind while reading the volume's Chinese teachings and the hope that the work would assist in making Christ the cornerstone to every life. The Jesuits initially focused on translating Confucian classics, rather than Buddhist scriptures or the Taoist canon, because of its greater importance in Chinese officialdom under the Ming and Qing. The works of Mencius were not originally translated because Matteo Ricci disliked Mencian interpretations of the other classic texts, particularly his strong condemnation of celibacy as unfilial. No√´l published his Six Classic Books of the Chinese Empire () at the same press the next year, although his manuscripts show he had been working on them since at least 1700. The six classics were the Great Learning ( or ), the Doctrine of the Mean (), the Analects (), the collected works of Mencius (), the Classic of Filial Piety (), and the Lesser Learning (). Each of the first four are completely new translations prefaced by Zhu Xi's commentaries (t, s, S√¨sh≈´ J√≠zh√π).. Each of the last three were the first European translations of the works. All were rather fairly freely translated from the editions established by Zhu Xi; his preface states the works are \\"not, so to speak, what the Chinese wrote but, I hope, what they really meant\\". For example, the first lines of the Doctrine of the Mean were rendered \\"The Law of Heaven is nature itself; the tendency of this nature is the way of acting correctly; the direction of this life is a right discipline of life, or the right precepts for living.\\" At the same time, he published his Three Treatises on Chinese Philosophy (). Its three sections deal with \\"On Knowledge of the First Being or God among the Chinese\\" (), \\"On the Ceremonies of the Chinese for the Dead\\" (), and \\"On Chinese Ethics\\" (). Unlike earlier Jesuit works, it does not claim that the Neo-Confucianism of Zhu Xi and others was a Buddhist corruption of Confucianism; it treats it as an organic development although still cautioning that its vague terms should not be used in reference to the Christian God. Finally, in the same year, he also published Historical Notices of Chinese Rituals and Ceremonies in the Veneration of Deceased Parents and Benefactors. It expands on the topic of the second his Three Treatises, with many more citations from Chinese works. Combatively polemical in describing an understanding of Chinese ancestral veneration that is compatible with Catholicism, it claimed a papal imprimatur for its publishing but was almost immediately suppressed. He published his Little Poetic Works () at Frankfurt in 1717. Its four parts comprise a Life of Jesus Christ under the Name of Divine Love (); Marian Letters (); a Life of St Ignatius of Loyola, Founder of the Jesuits (); and several tragedies (), including Philotas, Herod (), Love (), Lucifer, Accianus, and Henry (). An appendix includes the comedy Blind Sight (). He also published a popular theology textbook. ==See also== *Catholic Church in China *Jean Joseph Marie Amiot ==NotesReferences== Citations Bibliography * . * . * * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * .

With the establishment of the State of Israel, the name of the association was changed to the \\"Association of Painters and Sculptors in Israel\\". In 2002, the name was changed again to \\"Painters and Sculptors Association (Tel Aviv)\\" and three independent associations of painters and sculptors were established in Jerusalem, Haifa and Be'er Sheva. == Hebrew Artists Association == The association was founded in October 1920 by the Association of Hebrew Artists, in its committee were the following artists: Meir Gur-Arie, S. Ben-David, Abel Pann, Avraham Melnikov and Shmuel Opel. The aim of the association was to \\"develop and disseminate among the people the arts, the art work and taste and beauty in the Hebrew spirit.\\" In April 1921 the members of the association presented an exhibition at the Tower of David. Since 1923, the association has exhibited 19 different group exhibitions. These were eclectic exhibitions with many works of art on various artistic levels. Alongside these exhibitions, occasional group exhibitions were held on a commercial or artistic basis. In addition, the Society created the Painting and Sculpture Section of the journal \\"Theater and Art\\" which was published in 1927. == Association of Painters and Sculptors == On August 4, 1934, the first convention of the Association of Painters and Sculptors was held in Tel Aviv. There was talk about building a pavilion for exhibitions and a permanent exhibition, establishing a cooperative of painters, a club, mutual help and housing for the members of the association. A committee was chosen, composed of Chaim Gliksberg, Nahum Gutman, Newman, Avni, Yishai Kolbiansky, Leoben and Eliahu Sigard. Gliksberg was the association secretary. On August 14, a parallel assembly was held in Jerusalem, in which a committee was appointed that included Zeev Ben Zvi, Meir Gur-Arie and Jacob Steinhardt. One of the association's exhibitions, \\"The Eighth Exhibition,\\" took place in December 1942 at Habima Theatre, where the works of Arie Aroch, Aharon Giladi, Zvi Meirovitch, Avraham Natan (Nathanson), Avigdor Stematsky and Yehezkel Streichman were exhibited. Another sculptor, Dov Feigin appeared in the catalog but did not participate in the exhibition at last. Another exhibition ‚Äì \\"The Shiva Exhibition\\" ‚Äì took place in 1947 at the Tel Aviv Museum, with the participation of Aroch, Giladi, Meirovitch, Natan, Streichman, Jacob Wexler and Yosef Zaritsky. In these exhibitions, the artists aspired to the creation of modern art under European influence and to create \\"an original style, rooted in our reality.\\" In these exhibitions, although they did not establish a clear artistic platform, there was a tendency to emphasize the painterly means. In addition, these exhibitions symbolized a certain separation and a \\"positive appearance\\" of the artists against the background of the \\"generalism\\" regime ... which helps blur the boundaries and dimensions, in order to impose mediocrity \\" In 1948,Yosef Zaritsky served as chairman of the association, and when an invitation came to present an exhibition of Israeli artists in the Italian pavilion at the Venice Biennale, he chose not to share the list of participating artists because of his concern about the selection of medium-sized artists. In the wake of the accusations, several artists, including Moshe Castel, Streichman and Yohanan Simon, announced their immediate retirement from the association, and they established with Zaritsky the \\"Ofakim Hadashim\\". From 1964 to 1967, Ruth Horam served as the chairperson of the Association From 1969 to 1981, Alexander Bogen served as chairman of the Association. In the years 1989‚Äì2005, Rachel Shavit-Bentwich served as chairperson of the Association and as Chairperson of the Honorary Council. ==Israel Painters and Sculptors Association Members (partial list)== * Alima Gordon Gallery * Orna Lutski, since 1996 * Zvi Yehuda Aldouby The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem * Ora Lahav Chaaltiel The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem * Abraham Hasak, since 1959 The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem * Moshe Kassirer, since 2008 Artist website * Fain Maureen, since 1990 Jerusalem Artists House * Gad Ullman The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem (see Hebrew Gad Ullman) * Arie Wachenhauser, since 1962 The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem ==See also== Visual arts in Israel ==References External links == * Israel Arts Directory Category:Israeli sculptors Category:Israeli painters Category:Jewish Israeli artists Category:Arts in Israel Category:Organizations based in Israel Category:1934 establishments in Mandatory Palestine Category:Arts organizations established in 1934 ","title":"Israel Painters and Sculptors Association"},{"id":"56124558","text":"Vice-provincial or a vice-provincial may refer to * A vice-provincial superior, an assistant to a Jesuit provincial superior * A vice-provincial city in the People's Republic of China ==See also== * Provincial (disambiguation) ","title":"Vice-provincial"},{"id":"56124571","text":"The Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR) is a nonprofit digital newsroom.

The Government of Catalonia declared it a heritage festival of national interest on 16 November 2010. A few years later, in 2015, it was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists together with the summer solstice fire festivals in the Pyrenees. The festival revolves around burning torches (faies) after the traditional call to prayer on Christmas Eve. The fire is first started in the mountains, where the sun sets, and it is then brought to the towns by a group of fallaires in a dazzling display of lights against the night sky. Once in town, the fire-bearers share the fire with the rest of fallaires while those present chant Fia-faia, que nostro senyor ha nascut a la paia ('Let there be torches, for our Lord was born on hay'). == Origins == The festival's pre-Christian roots probably lie in a winter solstice ritual in which the faithful would have stood in collective prayer to stop the shortening of the days. Although the origins of this celebration of the winter solstice and the birth of Jesus Christ are lost to history, there are no doubts that it was already in place when Bag√† was established in the mid-14th century. == References == Category:Annual events in Catalonia Category:Christmas in Spain ","title":"Fia-Faia"},{"id":"56124755","text":"Mohammad Zubair (born 19 November 1981) is a Pakistani wicketkeeper batsman.

He wrote his own text, beginning \\"Clear in the darkness\\", three stanzas with the refrain \\"Ave Maria\\". Rutter scored the piece for four vocal parts (SATB) and piano, adding other versions. He composed it on a 1989 commission from The Bach Choir for the celebration of the 70th birthday of their conductor David Willcocks. It was first performed at the choir's Christmas concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, an event that Rutter knew from being a member of the audience as a boy. The work was published by Oxford University Press in 1990. It was published in a German edition, Weihnachts-Wiegenlied, with a text translated by Alex Brendelmeier, by B√§renreiter in 1998. It became part of the John Rutter Anniversary Edition. Christmas Lullaby has been recorded several times, notably with the composer conducting the Cambridge Singers on an album The John Rutter Christmas Album. It was also sung by the chamber choir Polyphony with the City of London Sinfonia, conducted by Stephen Layton. == Text and music == Rutter, who composed many works to celebrate Christmas, wrote his own text for Christmas Lullaby, beginning \\"Clear in the darkness a light shines in Bethlehem\\". He alludes to several aspects of the Christmas story, with a focus on combining reverence for the baby and for Mary, his mother, with the traditional words \\"Ave Maria\\" (Hail Mary). Marked Andante legato, the music is in F major and time. In the first stanza, the women's voices in unison sing of the angels, the men's voices of the wise men. In four-part homophony, marked pianissimo, all voices hail Mary, growing to mezzoforte in a second greeting. The second stanza, which switches the entrances of men and women, is focused on the King in the manger. In the third stanza, all are called to revere \\"with hearts full of love.\\" The \\"Ave Maria\\" returns, this last time with some counterpoint for a climax, but ending in the same soft homophony as before. == References  External links == * Rutter ‚Äì Christmas Lullaby St Mary's Singers Category:Compositions by John Rutter Category:1990 compositions Category:Choral compositions ","title":"Christmas Lullaby"},{"id":"56124765","text":"Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud is the first and current Saudi minister of culture.

However, it has been found that the family wore the habit of the Order in 1381, and Giovanni della Marra had been feudal lord of Bitetto from 1305 until his death in 1311. The Segreteria della Commenda di Malta in Rome also stated that their files do not make any reference to any buildings in Bitetto. The same is true of an act dated 26 November 1471 by the notary Nicola Guglielmo of Naples, in which Bernardo Garano di Riccaseus was entrusted with the Hospitaller commandery in Apulia, which included Bitetto. The document mentioned various holdings and assets, but none in Bitetto. Perhaps irrefutable proof to the fact that in the past no one talked about this building is the fact that the emblem of the Commenda di Malta, which depicts a rampant griffin, is completely absent in the complex. The building's second floor Known owners and inhabitants Ottavio de Nicol√≤ On the building's fa√ßade there is a coat of arms which is divided into two: the right depicting a castle with two towers on the sea (identical to another emblem found at the courtyard of the Bitonto Cathedral), and the left depicting a bearded face and a lily. The presence of the initials O. N. suggests that it belongs to Ottavio de Nicol√≤ or Nicolai, who fought in the Portuguese Restoration War and became vice-admiral of the Marina of Giovinazzo. From the date on the shield, it is understood that the complex was readapted in 1608. Seminary of Conza In the 17th century, the building also housed some part of the seminary of Conza. A plaque placed under the coat of arms reads Intrent securi qui querunt vivere pure. 1610, referring to future men of God. The seminary was a centre of studies for thirty eight years, and documents show that it was closed down in 1648. In 1753 a procurator who administered the property was still housed in the building ==Architecture== Eastern fa√ßade on Via San Antonio The building is spread over three levels, and it is built around an internal courtyard, with two sides arranged at right angles overlooking the street. It is located at the intersection between Via San Antonio and Via Leonese, with the latter containing the main fa√ßade. The main entrance includes an architrave with an ornate cornice, and it is located on the first floor so it is reachable by a staircase. An ornate mullioned window is found on the second floor. Two arched entrances are located on the ground floor of the eastern fa√ßade. The entire building has a service court at the back. The windows have stone architraves decorated with interesting geometric patterns. The two mullioned windows on the top floor are of great value, and one of them contains two openings surmounted by an archivolt perforated with a diamond-shaped bezel. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:Buildings and structures in the Province of Bari Category:Houses in Italy Category:Knights Hospitaller ","title":"Casa dei Cavalieri di Malta"},{"id":"56124823","text":"Hafiz Mohammad Zubair (born 22 June 1989) is a Pakistani cricketer.

Kingdom of Armenia (green) was a Pontic ally. The history of the coinage of the Pontic Kingdom probably began during reign of Mithridates II of the Kingdom of Pontus. Early Pontic coinage imitated coinage with Alexander the Great's portraits. Later coinage is well known for its high decree of realism in portraits of the Pontic kings who were proud of their Iranian ancestry. Pontic coin portraitry developed isolated from wider Hellenistic tradition. However, Mithridates V and his son Mithridates VI partially abandoned oriental influences in the coin portraitry. Pontic mints experimented with new materials for coinage. Pure copper and brass were used in mints during reign of Mithridates VI. His brass coinage are the earliest known coins made from brass. His rule and wars resulted in a wide expansion in number of mints and struck coinage. Earlier Pontic coinage attributable to prior rulers is very rare. Pontic coinage managed to gain a wide acceptance within eastern Mediterranean region. ==Evolution of Pontic coinage== Coin of Pharnaces I Prior to the Kingdom of Pontus, the Pontic region had autonomous, mostly coastal, cities with Greek background. Cities with mints were almost exclusively Greek colonies. It is likely that the first coinage was struck during Mithridates II's reign. His reign is assumed to have lasted from 255 BC to 220 BC. The first Pontic coinage mimicked other coinage with Alexander the Great's image on them. Mithridates III had issued substantial amount of silver coinage by the end of his reign. He was also the first Pontic ruler to have a coin with his own portrait. Before Mithridates VI Pontic coinage is very rare. This has complicated studies of royal Pontic coinage. However, chronology of the Pontic coinage is well known from research. For instance, Mithridates VI dated most of his coins by the Bithynian year and by month. There was a distinction between royal and city coinage. Royal coinage was struck on gold and silver. They also had king's image and name on them. Coinage produced by cities were made from bronze and had name of the city on reverse side of the coin. Coinage struck autonomously by cities was discontinued for a time, as the cities lost their autonomy under reign of Pharnakes I. Mithridates VI restored privilege of cities to have their own coinage, but he retained some control, as can be deducted from standardization of local coinage. Pontic coinage has very fine portraits of their kings. Only Greco-Bactrian coinage is minted in such a realistic detail. Greek engravers were hired to carve coin dies used in the minting process. Pontic ruling dynasty was very proud of its Iranian descent, and the portraits clearly show their oriental features. Mithridates III struck a coin with a Zeus holding an eagle on one side, and the other side portrayed himself as a non-idealized bearded old man with a short hair. It was customary to have more realistic coin portraits in the east. However, the Pontic dynasty had married early in the Seleucid royal line. The Pontic Kingdom remained stubbornly resistant to foreign influence. Despite the ruling dynasty's Iranian origins, the Pontic state is considered to be a Hellenistic state. Most of the population was also ethnically Iranian. Pontic portraiture developed outside the typical Hellenistic art. Mithridates V was the first king who had a relatively idealized portraiture about himself in coinage. The trend was further developed by his son Mithridates VI. The trend may have started from wishes of Mithridates V to show his Greek side more than his oriental background. Late Hellenistic Pontic coinage have been found around the Mediterranean. This may indicate mobility of people and goods from the period contemporary with the Pontic kingdom. Pontic coinage has been found from same coin hoards together with other Hellenistic coinage. Such hoards have been found from the Near East and in south-eastern Anatolia. It is likely that Pontic coins were widely accepted in the eastern Mediterranean region. The Kingdom of Bosporus was governed after its conquest by a son of Mithridates VI. Pontic coinage has been found from northern shores of the Black Sea. ==Coinage during Mithridates VI's reign== Mithridates VI Tetradrachm of Mithridates VI It has been suggested that Mithridates VI's policy allowed more isolated cities of the kingdom from central Black Sea region to profit. His goal may have been to bring a sense of unity to these cities. He allowed the most important cities to have their own copper coinage. Amaseia became exceptionally, for a brief period of time, the only Pontic city allowed to strike its own silver and gold coinage. Mithridates VI allowed this as a reward for the city's service for him. He also encouraged mints managed by temples. Mithridates VI imitated Alexander the Great in coin portraits. His coin portraits portray him as a young man with a flowing hair, long sideburns, a prominent nose and a narrow forehead. His hair and eyes are in a style similar with portrayals of Alexander. His coinage shows the late Pontic style that abandoned oriental tradition of non-idealized portrayals of kings. The new style is closer of common Hellenistic coinage. The most common image in his coinage, in various denominations, was a grazing animal together with a star and a crescent. Ivy leaves and grapes were also included to the scene. Pegasi and stags are two animals appearing in his coins. It has been suggested that after the Kingdom of Pontus expanded westward under his reign, the pegasus was abandoned and coins with a stag started to appear. This change would have been politically motivated as the pegasus would have been too closely associated with Persia. Mithridates VI did include in certain coins scenes about the myth of Perseus to emphasize his dual ancestry between Greece and Persia. Appian claimed that Perseus was an ancestor of Alexander the Great, while Herodotus thought Perseus as a Persian. The First and Second Mithridatic Wars were preceded with heavy minting. However, after the second war all minting ceased. During the wars between Rome and Pontus Mithridates VI funded his military campaigns by introducing new materials for coinage. Copper and brass coinage appeared as new financial sources for the Pontic state. Romans later exploited, during monetary reforms of Augustus in 23 BC, the wide circulation of these new forms of currency. Both materials are useful for overvalued coinage. Pure copper coinage may have been meant to partly substitute silver coinage. It is also possible that copper coins were meant for use in the region of Cimmerian Bosporus. ==Brass coinage== Brass is an alloy that was used relatively rarely in ancient times. Phrygia is the only region with a recorded regular use of brass from antique. Previously it was thought that Romans were the first to make brass coinage. Specimens contemporary with Julius Caesar and Augustus are known. Research conducted in 1970s revealed that brass was used half a century earlier than previously thought. Phrygia and Bithynia are known sources for Pontic brass coinage. Pontic brass coins were struck during the reign of Mithridates VI, and he can be regarded as the first ruler to make use of brass. Modern analyzes have revealed that some of his bronze coins are in fact made from brass. One study that analyzed Pontic and Celtic brass coins found out that selenium is an important impurity as it can be used to track down ore sources from the eastern parts of the classical world. Use of brass gradually spread towards west. ==Mints== There were mints in the cities of Amisos, Pharnaceia, Trapezus and Sinope. At the time of Mithridates VI the number of cities minting coins drastically increased. Cities such as Amaseia, Abonutheichos, Cabeira, Chabakta, Comana, Gaziura, Laodikeia and Taulara. Only Gaziura, of these cities, had minted coins in the past. ==See also== *Coinage of Side *Achaemenid coinage *Bithynian coinage *Ptolemaic coinage *Seleucid coinage ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Ancient currencies Category:Kingdom of Pontus ","title":"Coinage of the Kingdom of Pontus"},{"id":"56124903","text":"Commander Alexander Whistler Street, , known as \\"Sandy\\", is a judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and a Royal Australian Navy Reserve officer. He is the fifth-consecutive generation of the Street family to serve in Australian public life and the fourth-consecutive generation to serve as a magistrate of the Australian judiciary. ==Background== Alexander Whistler Street is the son of Colonel Sir Laurence Whistler Street and Susan Gai (n√©e Watt), who was Lady Street at the time of his birth. He is the grandson of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Kenneth Whistler Street and Jessie Mary Grey, Lady Street. Street's sister, Sylvia Emmett (n√©e Street), is a fellow judge of the Federal Circuit Court and naval officer. His brother-in-law, Justice Arthur Emmett, is also a judge of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. His other siblings by Sir Laurence and Lady (Susan) Street are Kenneth Street, a businessman, and Sarah Farley (n√©e Street), a lawyer and businesswoman. He has a half-sister by Sir Laurence‚Äôs second marriage to Lady (Penelope; n√©e Ferguson) Street, namely Jessie Street, who is also a lawyer. He has four children: Charles Street, a barrister; Jack Street, a lawyer; Lucy Street and Heidi Street. ==Career== Street was appointed to the Federal Circuit Court in January 2015 by Australian Attorney-General George Brandis. Street has since come under scrutiny by the Full Bench of the Federal Court of Australia over a case in which he dismissed a cerebral palsy sufferer's claim of discrimination after an airline refused to allow his guide dog on the flight. He has also received criticism from the Full Bench in two successful appeals of his decisions in which he was found to have denied litigants procedural fairness. Street has been subject to a number of apprehended bias applications, known as ALA15. Statistics were filed in court which revealed Judge Street had heard 256 migration matters between January and June 2017, and had found in favour of the immigration minister in 254 cases. A report from September 2018 stated that Sandy Street was found by the full Federal Court to have dismissed an asylum-seeker‚Äôs case without properly engaging with his arguments and to have denied the man procedural fairness. Two weeks later, the full Federal Court found he failed to give proper reasons in a case involving an Afghan asylum- seeker, effectively forcing a rehearing. In March 2019, the Federal Court criticised Street for taking 75 days to provide written reasons in a case where an asylum seeker had 21 days to appeal and refusing to respond to attempts at contact, holding that he had behaved with \\"a disheartening degree of professional discourtesy\\" and stating: \\"What happened in this case should never have happened but it is not the role of this court to discipline the judges of the Federal Circuit Court\\".

Together with Yabe, Enomoto, and Mr. Teru, Yoshir≈ç goes to Tokyo, where he infiltrates her high school. Shizuka Tachibana, a student at the school, tells him about a conflict between three different groups at the school, explaining that the male students formerly at the school have left in fear. Yoshir≈ç is convinced that Sae Asami is caught up in the conflict and seeks to help her. On the second day, Yoshir≈ç already finds that Yabe, Enomoto, and Mr. Teru have each been seduced by one of the three different groups. Sae Asami is found but she insists that she has not been kidnapped and that she is doing fine. Yoshir≈ç calls her father, Dr. Asami, and tells him that Sae's homeroom teacher Mr. Kajimoto says that Sae was merely missing school due to a cold. Dr. Asami tells Yoshir≈ç that Sae's homeroom teacher is supposed to be Mr. Fukikoshi and explains that Mr. Kajimoto is an academic rival who is jealous of Dr. Asami's newfound fame following the discovery of the psychics. Sae Asami and Shizuka Tachibana get into a fight over Yoshir≈ç in a classroom and are caught by the three groups, who tie them up and rub them with toy cars and mochi that they use to induce arousal. Yoshir≈ç, Yabe, Enomoto, and Mr. Teru confront the girls. The girls offer to take their virginity and the Yabe, Enomoto, and Mr. Teru are tempted by the offer but Yoshir≈ç reminds them that this will cause them to lose their psychic powers and convinces them to help him protect the world instead. The girls attempt to take their virginity by force but the boys use their powers to distract and frighten the girls. They find Sae Asami in the gymnasium and untie her. Mr. Kajimoto and Shizuka Tachibana enter and Shizuka explains that she helped to set up the encounter in order to aid her father, Mr. Kajimoto, whose career as a researcher was damaged due to Dr. Asami's discovery of psychics. Dr. Asami and Akiyama Takako arrive and Akiyama Takako uses a newfound power to force the end credits to roll early, eliminating Mr. Kajimoto's opportunity to explain his plan for revenge. Enomoto appears on stage in a leather fetish outfit in his attempt to confront Mr. Kajimoto but finds that Mr. Kajimoto and Shizuka Tachibana have already left. The girls from the school appear again to tempt Enomoto but Akiyama Takako uses her power once more to finally run the end credits. == Cast == *Sh≈çta Sometani as Yoshir≈ç Kamogawa *Erina Mano as Sae Asami *Rie Kitahara as Shizuka Tachibana *Makita Sports as Nagano Terumitsu a.k.a.

He is one of the earliest rappers to emerge in the Indian Hip Hop scene in the mid-2000s under the stage name Prozpekt. He also featured in the 2019 Bollywood film Gully Boy as himself. . == Career == Being exposed to Hip Hop music at an early age, Kaul started recording and releasing songs on his MySpace page in 2006, by 2008 he had gained a small local fanbase in New Delhi and racked up features with artists in the U.S and Canada. His first shot of success came with the release of the music video for \\"Kaisa Mera Desh\\" in 2010, becoming the first Indian hip hop song on YouTube and earning a #2 ranking as one of the most watched music videos in India overnight following its release. He also released a song titled \\"Vijay\\" in collaboration with international NGO Save The Children in 2013. After sporadic underground releases, Kaul switched from Prozpekt to his current stage name KR$NA after signing a record deal with Universal Music in 2013. In May 2014, he released his debut album Sellout, an all-English effort on Universal Music with its lead single \\"Last Night\\" peaking at #5 on the Vh1 Music Charts in India. Kaul became the first hip hop artist in India to do a five city album tour with a band. Following this, the music video for the title song \\"Sellout\\" was released but failed to make a large impact due to lackluster marketing and shrinking label budgets. After a 2-year hiatus, Kaul made his return in 2016 with his Hindi release \\"Vyanjan\\".

The first SPO algorithm was proposed for two- dimensional unconstrained optimization based on two-dimensional spiral models. This was extended to n-dimensional problems by generalizing the two- dimensional spiral model to an n-dimensional spiral model. There are effective settings for the SPO algorithm: the periodic descent direction setting and the convergence setting. == Metaphor == The motivation for focusing on spiral phenomena was due to the insight that the dynamics that generate logarithmic spirals share the diversification and intensification behavior. The diversification behavior can work for a global search (exploration) and the intensification behavior enables an intensive search around a current found good solution (exploitation). == Algorithm == Spiral Optimization (SPO) algorithm The SPO algorithm is a multipoint search algorithm that has no objective function gradient, which uses multiple spiral models that can be described as deterministic dynamical systems. As search points follow logarithmic spiral trajectories towards the common center, defined as the current best point, better solutions can be found and the common center can be updated. The general SPO algorithm for a minimization problem under the maximum iteration k_{\\\\max} (termination criterion) is as follows: 0) Set the number of search points m\\\\geq 2 and the maximum iteration number k_{\\\\max}. 1) Place the initial search points x_i (0) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n~(i=1, \\\\ldots, m) and determine the center x^{\\\\star}(0)= x_{i_\\\\text{b} }(0) , \\\\displaystyle i_\\\\text{b} =\\\\mathop{\\\\text{argmin}}_{i=1,\\\\ldots,m} \\\\\\\\{ f(x_{i}(0)) \\\\\\\\} ,and then set k = 0 . 2) Decide the step rate r(k) by a rule. 3) Update the search points: x_i(k+1) = x^{\\\\star}(k) + r(k) R(\\\\theta) (x_i(k) - x^{\\\\star}(k))\\\\quad(i=1, \\\\ldots, m). 4) Update the center: x^{\\\\star}(k+1) = \\\\begin{cases} x_{i_\\\\text{b}}(k+1) & \\\\big( \\\\text{if } f(x_{i_\\\\text{b}}(k+1)) < f(x^{\\\\star}(k)) \\\\big),\\\\\\\\\\\\ x^{\\\\star}(k) & \\\\big(\\\\text{otherwise} \\\\big), \\\\end{cases} where \\\\displaystyle i_\\\\text{b} = \\\\mathop{\\\\text{argmin}}_{i=1,\\\\ldots,m} \\\\\\\\{ f(x_i (k+1)) \\\\\\\\} . 5) Set k := k+1. If k=k_{\\\\max} is satisfied then terminate and output x^{\\\\star}(k). Otherwise, return to Step 2). == Setting == The search performance depends on setting the composite rotation matrix R(\\\\theta), the step rate r(k), and the initial points x_i(0)~(i=1,\\\\ldots,m). The following settings are new and effective.  Setting 1 (Periodic Descent Direction Setting)  This setting is an effective setting for high dimensional problems under the maximum iteration k_{\\\\max}. The conditions on R(\\\\theta) and x_i(0)~(i=1,\\\\ldots,m) together ensure that the spiral models generate descent directions periodically. The condition of r(k) works to utilize the periodic descent directions under the search termination k_{\\\\max}. * Set R(\\\\theta) as follows:R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0_{n-1}^\\\\top &-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ I_{n-1}& 0_{n-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} where I_{n-1} is the (n-1)\\\\times (n-1) identity matrix and 0_{n-1} is the (n-1)\\\\times 1 zero vector. * Place the initial points x_i(0) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n (i = 1,\\\\ldots, m) at random to satisfy the following condition: \\\\min_{i=1,\\\\ldots,m} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\max_{j=1,\\\\ldots,m} \\\\bigl \\\\\\\\{ \\\\text{rank} \\\\bigl[ d_{j,i}(0)~R(\\\\theta)d_{j,i}(0)~~ \\\\cdots~~R(\\\\theta)^{2n-1}d_{j,i}(0) \\\\bigr]\\\\bigr\\\\\\\\} \\\\bigr\\\\\\\\} = n where d_{j,i}(0) = x_{j}(0) - x_i(0). Note that this condition is almost all satisfied by a random placing and thus no check is actually fine. * Set r(k) at Step 2) as follows:r(k) = r = \\\\sqrt[ k_{\\\\max} ]{\\\\delta }~~~~\\\\text{(constant value)} where a sufficiently small \\\\delta > 0 such as \\\\delta = 1/k_{\\\\max} or \\\\delta = 10^{-3}.  Setting 2 (Convergence Setting)  This setting ensures that the SPO algorithm converges to a stationary point under the maximum iteration k_{\\\\max} = \\\\infty. The settings of R(\\\\theta) and the initial points x_i(0)~(i=1,\\\\ldots,m) are the same with the above Setting 1. The setting of r(k) is as follows. * Set r(k) at Step 2) as follows:r(k) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & (k^\\\\star \\\\leqq k \\\\leqq k^\\\\star + 2n-1), \\\\\\\\\\\\ h & (k \\\\geqq k^\\\\star + 2n), \\\\end{cases} where k^\\\\star is an iteration when the center is newly updated at Step 4) and h = \\\\sqrt[ 2n ]{\\\\delta }, \\\\delta \\\\in (0,1) such as \\\\delta = 0.5. Thus we have to add the following rules about k^\\\\star to the Algorithm: :‚Ä¢(Step 1) k^\\\\star = 0. :‚Ä¢(Step 4) If x^{\\\\star}(k+1) eq x^{\\\\star}(k) then k^\\\\star = k+1. == Future works == * The algorithms with the above settings are deterministic.

Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption, Lviv, where Bishop Rafal Kiernicki is buried in the crypt ==Life== Kiernicki was born in the peasant Roman Catholic family of Antoni and Michaela (n√©e Swiat≈Çowska) Kiernicki in a present day of the territory of the Sniatyn Raion of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine. After graduation of the primary school in his native village (1920‚Äì1924) and the neighbouring village Hvozdets (1924‚Äì1927), he continued to study in a Franciscan gymnasium in Lviv (1927‚Äì1934). While studied in gymnasium, he joined the Order of Friars Minor Conventual in 1930; made a profession on September 4, 1931 and a solemn profession on October 4, 1934. Kiernicki subsequently made a philosophical and theological studies at the Franciscan Theological Seminaries in Lviv, Krak√≥w and at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Lviv and the Major Roman Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv and was ordained as priest on June 29, 1939 by Archbishop Boles≈Çaw Twardowski. During first Soviet and Nazi occupations of the Western Ukraine he served as an parish priest and professor in the Theological Seminary. In the same time he was the clandestine member and chaplain of the Home Army. Was arrested by the NKVD in 1941, but avoided the death, because of the prison Brygidki's escape. In 1944 he was again arrested by NKVD and imprisoned until 1948, when was released and continued to serve as a parish priest and during a period of the Polish population transfers (1944‚Äì1946) he remained in the Soviet Union. Rest of his life he spent as a Dean of the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption, Lviv (1949‚Äì1958, 1965‚Äì1991). Here he worked until 1991 under the Communist persecution of the Religion. On January 16, 1991, he was appointed by the Pope John Paul II as an Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Lviv and a Titular Bishop of Dura. On March 2, 1991, he was consecrated as bishop by Metropolitan Archbishop Marian Jaworski and other prelates of the Roman Catholic Church in the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption, Lviv. Kiernicki died in office in Lviv on November 23, 1995 in the age 83. Kiernicki's canonisation process was opened on May 4, 2012 in the century of his birth date in the Cathedral Basilica in Lviv and he became a Servant of God. ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1995 deaths Category:People from Sniatyn Raion Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Polish Austro-Hungarians Category:Conventual Friars Minor Category:Conventual Franciscan bishops Category:Ukrainian people of Polish descent Category:University of Lviv alumni Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Soviet Union Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Ukrainian Roman Catholic bishops Category:Servants of God ","title":"Rafal Kiernicki"},{"id":"56125122","text":"The 1946 Western Reserve Red Cats football team represented the Western Reserve University in the American city of Cleveland, Ohio, now known as Case Western Reserve University, during the 1946 college football season.

They divide into two language regions: the dialects spoken in the southern Eifel (Eifelisch) are part of the Moselle Franconian dialect group and closely resemble Luxembourgish. In the northern Eifel, by contrast, the dialects (Eifelplatt) belong to the Ripuarian dialect group and are more like √ñcher Platt or K√∂lsch. In between there is a dialect continuum of typical transitions, whereby more or less every village speaks a little differently from its neighbours. == Linguistic geography == The development of territorial structures in the Eifel since the Roman era is reflected in the development of the Eifel dialects. From a linguistic point of view, the Eifel can be divided into the Moselle Franconian and the Ripuarian dialect regions. The \\"Eifel language barrier\\", which separates the two dialects along a broad strip of territory, extends from the northern part of the Bitburg-Pr√ºm, via Kronenburg, Blankenheim, Nettersheim, Altenahr and Ahrweiler along the Vinxtbach to its confluence with the Rhine at Bad Breisig. The old Roman border between Germania superior and Germania inferior ran here too. In the feudal period, the border between the Electorate of Trier and Electorate of Cologne also followed this line and, today, the border between North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate runs within this strip of land, which in linguistics is also referred to as the Vinxtbach Line or Dorp-Dorf Line.http://www.rheinische-landeskunde.lvr.de/sprache/namen/ortsnamen/ on 3 September 2012 The Eifel dialect is also spoken in the neighbouring German- speaking Community of Belgium. Especially in the southern part of this region, which is also called the Belgian Eifel, the dialect has been able to preserve its importance in everyday life. Historically, these territories belonged mainly to the Duchy of Luxembourg (until 1815), while smaller elements belonged to the Electorate of Trier. == Literature == * Fritz Koenn: \\" - Eifeler W√∂rter und Ausdr√ºcke gesammelt und kurzweilig erkl√§rt von Fritz Koenn\\".

It was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and first aired on 14 March 2017, on BBC Two. The episode, which was directed by Guillem Morales, follows the story of David, played by Shearsmith, a middle class stay-at-home dad, who happens across a lone black shoe. Much to the concern of his wife Louise, played by Keeley Hawes, he becomes obsessed with finding the shoe's owner. The episode follows the development of his obsession. Rosa Strudwick plays Sally, David and Louise's daughter, and Pemberton plays Chris, a family friend. Danny Baker voices a radio presenter, and Mathew Baynton also appears. The episode was inspired by Pemberton's own chance encounter with a single shoe. The episode is split into four, corresponding to the four seasons, and features extracts of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. The cinematography features many views of symmetrical pairs of objects, as well as shots of empty rooms. The device of the seasons, as well as the music and cinematography, relate to David's emotional state. Critics responded very positively to \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\", particularly praising Morales's direction and the performances of Shearsmith, Hawes, and Baynton. ==Production== The third series of Inside No. 9 was announced in October 2015, and heavily publicised in January 2016, at which time Keeley Hawes and Mathew Baynton were named as guest stars in the series. \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" was the fifth and penultimate episode of the series, and the fourth of a run of five episodes beginning February 2017‚Äîthe series's first episode being the December 2016 Christmas special \\"The Devil of Christmas\\". It first aired on 14 March 2017, on BBC Two. \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" was inspired by a chance encounter that Pemberton had with a single shoe on his way to work, leading him to consider the result of someone obsessively attempting to return it to its rightful owner. He claimed that the episode's premise then came to him \\"fully formed\\". He took Shearsmith to see the shoe, and the pair began writing the episode immediately. Coincidentally, Shearsmith also encountered a single shoe some days later, though it did not match the first. \\"You start seeing them everywhere\\", Shearsmith noted, \\"once you start looking\\". For Pemberton, this inspiration worked because it was completely random; were he to have gone out look for inspiration, he claimed, it would not have worked. The episode is split into four, corresponding to the four seasons, and features music from Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. It takes its name from the nursery rhyme \\"Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling, My Son John\\". \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" starred Shearsmith as David, Hawes as David's wife Louise, Rosa Strudwick as the couple's daughter Sally, and Pemberton as Chris, a family friend. Danny Baker voiced a radio presenter, and Baynton appeared as Ted. When contacted about appearing in Inside No. 9, Hawes was starring in The Durrells. However, as \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" would take only a week to film, she was able to move straight from The Durrells to Inside No. 9. Her respective characters, despite having close names, were very different. According to Pemberton, Hawes had hoped to dislike the script so that she could turn down the role. When she read it, however, she could not resist. \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" was the Inside No. 9 producer Adam Tandy's favourite episode of the series, while Pemberton considered it one of the best. Shearsmith identified David as one of his favourite characters from the series, and said that he fondly remembered working with Hawes, whom he praised as a performer. Hawes commended Inside No. 9, the episode's script, and Morales's direction, expressing how much she had enjoyed working with Pemberton and Shearsmith, as well as the amount she had laughed during the filming process. ==Plot== ;Spring David, a middle class stay-at-home dad, lives with his wife Louise and daughter Sally. While out jogging, he encounters a single slip-on dress shoe. David keeps an eye on the shoe, and, by the time Louise arrives home that evening, has moved it to the dinner table. Louise drops it on the floor, though David's attention remains on it. Later, in daytime, David chastises Sally for playing with the shoe, and Louise is angry that he has hung posters advertising his find that feature their phone number. ;Summer The family celebrate Sally's birthday, while the shoe sits under a sofa. Later, Chris, a family friend, visits. He may have a job for David, but, to Louise's horror, David begins talking about his \\"project\\". Louise has binned the shoe; David is mortified, and Louise challenges him to not speak about the shoe for two minutes. He fails, and storms out to search the bin. Louise and Chris share a tender moment, but David does not notice; he is more concerned with how Chris could help him publicise his search for the shoe's owner. David's multimedia campaign and reward offer, initially unsuccessful, ultimately result in a visit from a young man who has a matching shoe. David interrogates him at length. Once satisfied by his account, and having spent a final few moments alone with the newly matched pair, he reluctantly hands it over, holding back tears. ;Autumn Sally and Louise are happy in the kitchen, when David, smartly dressed and with a confident manner, returns from work. Despite Louise's reservations, Sally performs a piece she will present in her school assembly, involving the nursery rhyme \\"Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling\\": > Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John, Went to bed with his trousers on! One > shoe off, and one shoe on, Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John! Despite a pained expression, David applauds, hugging his daughter. ;Winter Louise encounters the shoe outside her house. Inside, David confronts her about a photograph he has found‚ÄîLouise's college friend, Ted, is the man to whom David gave the shoe. He has also found a receipt for a new set of shoes, bought by Louise shortly before Ted's visit. David accuses Louise of giving him false hope, and, in response to her exasperation, says that it was never about the shoe. David is in grief, having never recovered from the death of Sally's twin brother, Joseph, six years earlier. Like the shoes, the children were \\"Two halves ... and one of them's gone\\", though he believes that \\"they should be together\\". Louise finds blood on David's hands, but it is not his own. He had driven to Norfolk to retrieve the shoe from Ted, but does not remember what he has done. The emergency services arrive outside. On a cabinet is a photograph of a smiling David holding two infants. He is wearing the shoes. Over the credits, security footage from 15 March 2016 shows David placing the shoe outside his house before jogging away. ==Analysis== The episode uses The Four Seasons, by Vivaldi (pictured) to mark changing seasons and David's changing mental state. \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\", with David's obsessive search for the shoe's owner, offered a \\"macabre reimagining\\" of Cinderella for Sean O'Grady of The Independent. The journalist Andrew Billen, on the other hand, said that the episode did not present the shoe as an allusion to Cinderella or so that viewers might wait to hear \\"the other shoe drop\\". Instead, the shoe is presented as \\"lonesome aberration\\", and, on at least one occasion, is actively anthropomorphised by David. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau identified \\"stories of men who marry their VW Golfs or women who fancy the Eiffel Tower\\" as something he initially thought an inspiration, and noted The Good Life as a potential influence for David and Louise's lifestyle. However, the episode diverged strongly from what he had expected, as David's obsession did not involve romantic love, and the episode as a whole was low on humour. \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" is a relatively simple episode, described by one critic as \\"really just a quiet character study of a man losing his grip\\". The episode uses Vivaldi's The Four Seasons to mark the passage of time, which is also portrayed by changing colour palettes. The score and setting convey David's emotional and mental fragility, with a contrast drawn between the chaotic music and controlled cinematography. The seasons, too, convey David's mental state: first the decline, then the \\"autumnal calm\\", then the collapse. The episode's closing scene is, according to several critics, ambiguous, as it is unclear whether David has visited violence on Ted or on Sally. Similarly, the nature of Louise's relationships with both Ted and Chris is open to interpretation: one critic noted the \\"little moment\\" of Louise's interaction with Chris, and questioned whether David might believe Louise to be having an affair with Ted. The family's home has a \\"sterile\\" feeling, and features a large number of objects in symmetrical pairs. This mise-en-sc√®ne reflects \\"David's psychosis, and what he and Louise [have] lost in the death of Sally's twin brother\\". Relatedly, shots of unoccupied rooms create a sense of emptiness, while the final shot of Ted shows him as a \\"half person\\". Critics identified the direction as Hitchcockian, while Tandy characterised it as Bergmanesque. The \\"number 9\\" of \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" was not the family home, but the shoe, which was size 9. Despite taking place in a small number of rooms or just outside, the episode does not have the feeling of claustrophobia that is present in some other episodes. \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" represented a sharp change of tone from the previous episode of Inside No. 9, \\"Empty Orchestra\\". For Mark Butler of i, the episode's melancholic mood, uneasy domestic setting, and allusions to mental illness link it to \\"Tom & Gerri\\", an episode from Inside No. 9 first series. ==Reception== \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" was very well received by critics, some of whom characterised it as an improvement on the weaker \\"Empty Orchestra\\". Dessau identified it as a \\"terrific instalment\\", while O'Grady discussed it as a key example of how high-quality television continues to survive in the 21st century, as part of \\"a renaissance in British comedy\\". It was, for him, comparable with the best of Shearsmith and Pemberton's previous work; Billen, similarly, characterised it as one of the best episodes of Inside No. 9. For the freelance critic Dan Owen, \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" was a \\"characteristically rich and rewarding experience\\", for Patrick Smith of the Daily Telegraph, it was a \\"delicious slice of macabre humour\\", and for Hannah J Davies, of TheGuardian.com, it was \\"excellent\\", even if \\"not the strongest episode of the series\\". Mark Butler, of inews.co.uk, said that the episode \\"managed to weave a genuinely gripping and powerful half hour of TV from a seemingly bizarre and banal set-up: a testament to [Inside No. 9] ongoing mastery of mood\\". Julie McDowall, of The National, called it \\"a brilliantly slow, creeping and sinister episode\\". Similarly, Victoria Segal and Helen Stewart of The Sunday Times praised the way that the episode \\"builds up an atmosphere of creeping dread\\", but were critical of the \\"slightly tasteless conclusion\\" to which the episode \\"dribbles\\". In the sister paper The Times, however, Billen praised the conclusion, saying it \\"brought with it a tide of distress\\"; on the website of The Times, Hugo Rifkind characterised the ending as somewhat anticlimatic, suggesting that the best mysteries are never solved. Also writing for The Times, Chris Bennion praised the \\"near genius\\" premise, calling the episode a \\"witty glimpse of midlife inadequacy\\" that became darker as it progressed. Butler identified the device of the shifting seasons as \\"a clever and striking touch\\", characterising the episode as moving from \\"laugh out loud\\" humour to \\"profoundly uncomfortable\\" interactions, with a \\"hard to swallow\\" and \\"disquieting\\" conclusion. Morales's direction received high praise, as did the performances of Hawes, Baynton, and especially Shearsmith. Bennion, though, suggested that Hawes and Baynton were \\"somewhat underused\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * *\\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" at BBC Programmes *\\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\" at the British Comedy Guide Category:2017 British television episodes Category:Grief Category:Inside No. 9 episodes Category:Television episodes about mental illnesses Category:Television episodes about marriage ","title":"Diddle Diddle Dumpling (Inside No. 9)"},{"id":"56125311","text":"Lennox G.

He grew up in Znojmo and in a small village in central Bohemia. In 2006-2008 he studied at an art school, majoring in playing the guitar, which he was not able to finish. He continued his studies at a grammar school where he received an E in a music class. ‚ÄúAt that point I told myself there is no authority nor institution called school that will help me get wherever I want to be.

However, he decided not to pursue this course. Instead of studying in prestigious universities, he decided to devote his life to music. While studying he was involved in many fashion shows and shoots for major brands, such as Diesel, Replay or Prada. He ended this promising career as he did not agree with its practises. After his modelling experience he made a living by busking in large European cities, such as Prague, Oslo, Zurich, Hamburg, and Vienna. ‚ÄúBusking was the best musical education I could ever have wished for. If I hadn¬¥t started in the streets, I would never have understood what it means to be a musician,‚Äù Mikolas says. At that time he was also cleaning a recording studio during the week ‚Äì so that he could produce his own music there once a month whenever it was empty. In 2018 he appeared in a selection of ‚Äú18 inspiring people of 2018‚Äù in a Forbes magazine who ‚Äúovercome convention and inspire others‚Äù. In 2019 he was the face of an ad campaign for Tezenis underwear and Huawei. In 2019 he and his family established their own independent record company, Vivienne Records. Mikolas¬¥ family supported him in his career from the beginning and now they make up his management team. ==Music career== Mikolas decided to pursue music professionally. He independently released his debut single \\"Hands Bloody\\" in 2015. The following year, he released the single \\"Free\\", which became a top four hit in the Czech Republic. That same year, he also released the single \\"Believe (Hey Hey)\\". After this he moved to Vienna, following an invitation by Nikodem Milewski. Josef was approached to represent the Czech Republic in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 with the song \\"My Turn\\", but rejected the offer as he did not believe the song suited him. In November of 2017, Josef released the single \\"Lie to Me\\" where he spoke about infidelity in a past relationship. \\"You can always look at things from a different perspective, even though they might feel like the worst at that moment\\". He later confirmed that the song would compete in the Czech national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon. \\"Lie to Me\\" later won the national selection, and represented the Czech Republic in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. He finished 6th with 66 points from the international jury and 215 points from the audience, giving the Czech Republic its best result so far in the competition. In May of 2020 Lie to Me reached 30 million streams on Spotify, a major global streaming platform, which puts the single into the position of most streamed Czech song. In April 2018, in Munich, he signed an international deal with Sony Music and RCA Records. Later in 2018, he released the single \\"Me Gusta\\" on which he collaborated with a Swedish song writer Joacim Persson and others. Its music video was shot in the baroque library Klementinum. \\"Abu Dhabi\\" was his final release for Sony Music. Since then, he began recording independently once more, currently for Vivienne Records. \\"Acapella\\", a latino-themed song, was his first release for this label. It achieved success in Czech Republic (his first chart-topper here) and in Poland. At the end of November 2019, he released a single ‚ÄúColorado‚Äù. The inspiration behind it came from his longing for countryside and mountains and to once again be the person he used to be before all the publicity.Netky.sk [online].

She is also a former editor-in-chief of Salon and author of the book What's the Matter with White People? ==Early life and education== Walsh was born in September 1958 in Brooklyn to an Irish Catholic family; in 1960, her family moved to Oceanside, Long Island. She has one brother and one sister. At the age of 13, her family moved to a northern suburb of Milwaukee where she attended high school. Her mother died when she was 17. She is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. == Career == When online magazine Salon launched in 1998, Walsh became its first news editor, and later, for six years, its editor-in-chief. In 2015, she left Salon for The Nation, but continued to work as an analyst at MSNBC. On December 23, 2017, Walsh revealed that MSNBC had chosen not to renew her contract, which the network said was a decision made because of an annual review. In their statement, MSNBC also said that \\"Unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt renew Joan, but she and her distinct perspective will still be invited on our shows.\\" She had worked there for twelve years, six of them under contract. The decision prompted critical reactions from other MSNBC personalities, including Joy Reid and Chris Hayes. Some of Walsh's supporters also protested MSNBC's decision using the Twitter hashtag #KeepJoanWalsh. Later that day, Walsh tweeted that she would move to CNN in 2018, which was soon confirmed by a CNN spokeswoman. On April 1, 2018, Kyle Kashuv, a witness of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, tweeted that Walsh \\"liked\\" a tweet criticizing him. She replied, \\"Are you really policing who 'likes' tweets from a grieving Parkland father who lost his daughter?

This also includes scientific ecotourism, cognitive ecotourism, blindwatching, botanical excursions, video and photo excursions, ethnic tourism, and other activities. To climb the Kok-Zhaylau is necessary to make an ascent on the Northern watershed of the gorge. This route is very popular, due to the fact that during one day from the Kok-Zhailau plateau, you can make different hikes: 1) on the Terisbutak river, make a descent to The Big Almaty gorgehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Almaty_Lake‚Äì to the city along the \\"Observatorsky comb\\"; 2) along the Kamenskiy ridge to the health resort \\"AK Kain\\" through the Maloalmatinsky and Kamenskoye gorges, etc. ==Controversy== The president of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, gave way to build a major ski complex within the Ile-Alatau National Park.

Let's Play Heroes is an action-adventure beat 'em up video game developed by Capybara Games and published by Cartoon Network Games. It is based on the show OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes and was released digitally on January 23, 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, with a port to the Nintendo Switch launching physically in 2019. A physical release of the game bundled with Grumpyface Studios' Steven Universe: Save the Light for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch was released in May 2019.https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/3/17648148/steven-universe-ok-ko-game- nintendo-switch-release-date ==Plot== When Lord Boxman takes away all the levels of the heroes' pow cards, K.O. must set things right and must learn at heart that he is a true hero. ==Gameplay== K.O. is controlled when fighting against villains. The player can use moves such as an uppercut, punch combo, low kick, etc. The player can collect their stats after defeating all enemies to earn new moves such as a charge punch, a controllable fist, and a stronger uppercut. During combat, taking damage or dealing damage will raise a bar towards using a special ability called a Powie Zowie, where the player will summon the character in the card and get help. Some examples include Rad, who allows players to levitate and shoot beams, and Carol, who will appear and start doing a combo in front of the player. ==Development== On December 7, 2017, the first trailer for the game was released. ==Reception== Upon release, OK K.O.! Let's Play Heroes received mostly positive reviews. A review by PlayStation LifeStyle remarked that the game \\"shows that licensed kids cartoon adaptations don‚Äôt have to be mediocre, and that they can be filled with the same charm as the television shows that made them beloved in the first place.\\", but was criticized for its repetitive combat. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2018 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Video games based on television series Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Cartoon Network video games ","title":"OK K.O.!

It is celebrated every year on \\"Straw Sunday\\" (German: Schafssonntag, Moselle Franconian: Schoof-, Schoofs-, Sch√∂f-, Schoaf-, Schaufs-, Scheifsunndich or Scheefsunndich, where Scheef= \\"truss of straw\\"), the first Sunday after Shrove Tuesday (Carnival Day or Fastnacht), also observed as Funkensonntag. == Course of events == H√ºttenbrennen is celebrated differently in each Eifel town. What all places have in common is that the village youth - mostly male - collect straw and other combustible materials. In most villages, the material is collected only on Sundays, but some of them also collect the brushwood from nearby spruce forests many weeks in advance. These are then collected into a stacked pile, usually on an eminence, which is lit after nightfall. In many places, the burning material is also topped by a wooden cross, which is also decorated with straw etc. In some places, preparations begin on the Saturday. In some places, such as Gees, Neroth, Steffeln, Walsdorf, Pellingen, Franzenheim (Trier-Saarburg), a wheel of fire is rolled down the mountain, known in Moselle Franconian as Radscheewen, Radscheywen, Radschiwwele or Raderschl√§le. The wheel represent the life-giving spring sun - and is also known as the wheel of joy. After the fire, the village youth usually move from house to house to collect a reward for their work. This usually consists of eggs, which are then collected and eaten together in the form of scrambled eggs. Of course, money is also well received. In some places, the fire is also traditionally prepared by the Volunteer Fire Brigade, who then move from house to house to be served. However, there are also places where young people who have recently arrived entertain the other young people, or where only the bachelors are allowed to collect and eat eggs. In some places of the Eifel it is customary on Straw Sunday evening to feed newlyweds or newcomers to the village with eggs and Nautzen (German: Krapfen i.e. filled doughnuts). In some cases this custom has also been adopted by local restaurants. == Sequence in pictures == H√ºttenbrennen a.jpg1 H√ºttenbrennen b.jpg2 H√ºttenbrennen c.jpg3 H√ºttenbrennen d.jpg4 H√ºttenbrennen e.jpg5 H√ºttenbrennen f.jpg6 H√ºttenbrennen g.jpg7 H√ºttenbrennen h.jpg8 H√ºttenbrennen i.jpg9 H√ºttenbrennen j.jpg10 H√ºttenbrennen k.jpg11 H√ºttenbrennen l.jpg12 == See also == The winter burning.

A design was ordered from Ricus van de Stadt and the order to build her was placed with Thesens of Knysna. Originally designed as a ketch, she was later re-rigged as a racing sloop by Brian Lello. Lello was the then-editor of the SA Yachting magazine, who created a technical outline of what was needed to create a race-winner. This outline was sent to Van de Stadt who then created the design for Voortrekker. Thesens of Knysna won the tender and quoted R35,000 for the construction. However, no financial backers came forward so Dr Anton Rupert of the Rembrandt Group offered to guarantee payment so that construction could begin. At the same time the Trust began looking for a skipper and Bruce Dalling was selected to be her first skipper. Dalling took Voortrekker to first place on handicap in the Observer Transatlantic Race. His success in this race led to a surge of interest in sailing in South Africa. In 1969 Voortrekker was handed over to the South African Navy Sailing Association, to be used for sail training and to take part in ocean racing for South Africa. ==1982/83 BOC Challenge== In 1982 Voortrekker (branded Altech Voortrekker to reflect its sponsorship by Altech) entered the BOC Challenge. Voortrekker was skippered by Navy Warrant Officer Bertie Reed and was 17 years old at that time, the oldest boat in the fleet.McCormick, Herb & Day, George. Everest of the Sea, Cruising World August 1983, p. 98 Reed described her as the \\"fastest, most uncomfortable, prettiest 50-footer around\\". Due to her age and being pitted against competitors using the latest technologies and materials available at the time, Voortrekker was considered obsolete. Despite this, Reed placed second across the line and first on handicap, behind the yacht Credite Agricole, which had been purpose- built for this race. ==Sail training== Voortrekker was later used for sail training by the South African Navy and entered in a number of Cape to Rio races with sailors from disadvantaged backgrounds in conjunction with the Izivunguvungu Sailing School. In 2009, after an absence of 14 years, Voortrekker entered the 2009 Cape to Bahia race. ==References== Category:1960s sailing yachts Category:Sailing yachts built in South Africa ","title":"Voortrekker (yacht)"},{"id":"56125978","text":"Richard H.

His parents were William Brewster Clark, a New York physician, and Fanny Cox. He attended private schools in New York City and The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. In 1910, he earned a BA from Amherst College. He studied law in Columbia University but received an MA in government and politics in 1913. ==Career== Early career RSGB, for which Clark worked, published Soviet Russia magazine, later turned over to Friends of Soviet Russia organization In 1913, Clark began his career as instructor in government at Princeton University. In 1917, he became research director for the Socialist members of the New York Board of Aldermen. In 1919, Clark became assistant director of a commercial department and then director information for the Russian Soviet Government Bureau (AKA the \\"Soviet Bureau\\"), an unofficial diplomatic organization established by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the United States during the Russian Civil War (1919‚Äì1920). On March 28, 1919 and April 11, 1919 The New York Times published articles urging to close what it deemed the illegal representation of the Soviet Bureau. A number of government agencies conducted inquiries of the RSGB prior to its office being raided, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Directorate of Military Intelligence, and the War Trade Board. Information was provided as requested, with Soviet Bureau official Evans Clark noting to assistant director of the War Trade Board G.M. Bodman at a meeting on April 25, 1919, that the bureau \\"had nothing to conceal\\" and was \\"glad to furnish information to those entitled to have it.\\" Additionally, Martens and his lawyer Charles Recht had met personally with officials of the Department of Justice in April and May, while Clark travelled to Washington, D.C. to consult with the personal secretary of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. In 1919, Clark also joined the left-wing American People's Freedom Union (1919‚Äì1920). The union's executive secretary was Frances M.

In the early 1920s the Socialist Party was in severe membership decline and funding of the New York Call became correspondingly tenuous. In a last-ditch effort to save the paper, it was reorganized in the fall of 1923 to include non-Socialists in its management. On October 1, 1923 the name of the paper was formally changed to the New York Leader as a reflection of this new orientation. Pacifist minister Norman Thomas, formerly of The World Tomorrow, was named as editor of the publication. Heber Blankenhorn became managing editor, Evans Clark business manager, and Ed Sullivan sportswriter. This effort to stabilize the daily newspaper's funding was unsuccessful, however, and the New York Leader was terminated just six weeks later. In 1925, Clark wrote editorials, books reviews, and feature stories for the New York Times through 1928. Twentieth Century Fund Logo of The Century Foundation, formerly the Twentieth Century Fund, with which Clark was a leader for nearly a half century In 1928, Clark became the first executive director of the Twentieth Century Fund (founded by Boston merchant Edward A. Filene), a role he served until 1958. The fund conducted economic research and fostered public education on economic problems. Under Clark, the Fund began its own research into controversial areas, \\"working on the theory that controversy is an index of a topic's importance and of the need for its objective study.\\" Topics included: consumer credit, pre-payment group medical service, economic sanctions in relation to peace, internal debts of the United States of America, old age security, and labor cartels. From 1958 to his death in 1970, Evans remained a member of the Fund's board of trustees. Other efforts In 1935, Evans became an economic advisor to the New York City Housing Authority, which he served until 1937. Concurrently, he served as chairman of the board of directors of the National Public Housing Conference. Concurrently, he served as chairman of the New York State Adjustment Board of the National Recovery Administration. In 1937, he served on the panel of arbitrators of the New York City Labor Relations Board. In 1944, Clark was a major co-founder of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, a non- profit organization that eventually provided medical care through 30 groups to more than 750,000 people in the New York City area. After World War II, he became a champion for world peace and offered his views for the post-war world publicly: > We as a people know much more clearly now than we did when the last war > ended what we want of the peace. We want no more Depression this time. We > want work; we want to be able to buy, with the money we earn, decent food, > clothing and homes to live in; we want security in illness and old age; we > want our children educated; and we want at least some of the luxuries that > science and machinery have paraded be fore our eyes‚Äîan automobile, a radio, > household conveniences. New York Times As earlier mentioned, in 1925, Clark wrote editorials, books reviews, and feature stories through 1928. From 1954 to 1962, he served as a member of the NYT's editorial board and wrote about social and economic issues. ==Personal and death== In November 1915, Evans married Freda Kirchwey, editor and publisher of The Nation magazine. They had three sons, of whom only one, Michael, survived childhood. Evans died age 82 on August 28, 1970, in Nyon, Switzerland, where his wife and he were visiting their son. ==Legacy== At his death, the New York Times wrote in tribute: > Long before Franklin D.

She is known to posterity in particular, partly because she married the poet and activist Georg Herwegh, and partly because she was an exceptionally prolific letter writer. == Life ==  Provenance and early years  Emma Charlotte Siegmund was born in Berlin or, more probably, Magdeburg. Sources differ. Johann Gottfried Siegmund (1792-1865), her father, was a prominent and successful Berlin silk merchant. He came from an old Jewish family, but had himself committed to Protestantism. Emma grew up in a prosperous home: Lucas Sch√∂nlein, their family doctor, was also the family doctor of the king, whose palatial city residence was close by. She was the middle sister of three. There was also a brother, Gustav August Siegmund (1815-1902) who would grow up to become a Berlin physician and minor politician. She enjoyed a first-class education, through which she mastered three foreign languages (French, Polish and Italian). Musically gifted, she composed, painted, translated, enjoyed theater and wrote poetry.Michail Krausnick: Nicht Magd mit den Knechten (Marbacher Magazin 83/1998). Marbach 1998, , p. 3 and beyond. Despite the liberal open atmosphere of the parental home, where various prominent Berliners were regular visitors, and despite plenty of animated conversations with friends, the diaries she kept as an adolescent indicate that she felt acutely constrained by the dull and conventional \\"bourgeois\\" life which she led: > Mornings nothing, afternoons nothing and evenings not a lot ... Saturday > some hours with Valentini [her Italian teacher], dull lesson about a [long > since forgotten] play ... Exhausted - evening boat trip - whist party. > Ennui. Potato salad.Emma Siegmund: Tagebuch, 22. Februar 1839; 12. Mai 1839; > 13. September 1841. as quoted in: Barbara Rettenmund und Jeannette Voirol: > Emma Herwegh. Die gr√∂sste und beste Heldin der Liebe. Limmat Verlag, Z√ºrich > 2000, , p. 21. As a young woman she evinced a certain tomboyishness. A phrase reproduced in several sources indicates that she \\"often violated the conventions of her time: she rode like the devil, shot with pistol, on holiday in 1841 swam in the sea off Helgoland, smoked, and took an interest in gymnastics\\". When she was thirteen her political consciousness was engaged by the 1830 French revolution, and slightly closer to home, two years later, the \\"Hambach Festival\\". She also drew inspiration from the Polish liberation movement. Because of her friendship with Emilia Sczaniecka, twelve years her senior, it is evident from their correspondence that she was unusually well informed about the Polish situation in the aftermath of successive partitions of Polish territory between Russia and Prussia. Her sympathies lay with the oppressed population, which meant uncompromising rejection of the Prussian and Russian positions. Even before she met Georg Herwegh she was enthusiastic about another revolution: > I read about French revolutionary history and was seized by a volcanic > passion, at once burning, at once half frozen. - But how might it be if the > time came when every man thought like a king, when everyone was taught such > a level of empowerment that people saw one another only as brothers, where > only merit mattered, where divine spirit was revealed in every human heart, > to the point where kings were no longer needed?Emma Siegmund: Tagebuch, > 24./25. Oktober 1841. as quoted in: Michail Krausnick: Nicht Magd mit den > Knechten. (= Marbacher Magazin Nr. 83/1998.). Marbach 1998, , p. 8. The death of the king in June 1840 brought the prospect of a new generation of monarch, and many of those who back in 1832 had celebrated visions of liberalism and democracy at Hambach dared to think their moment had arrived. Emma Siegmund did not share their optimism. The new king was crowned on 18 October 1840. She did not need to walk far from the family home to witness the festivities. Her diary comment comprised three words: \\"Everywhere boring\\" (\\"Langeweile √ºber alles\\"). By this time she was frequently escaping from the middle-class stuffiness of the family home in Berlin by visiting her friend Emilia Sczaniecka whose family estate at Pakos≈Çaw near Posen became like a second home to her. The two were in several ways - notably politically - kindred spirits, and spent long hours together discussing independence and freedom (for Poland). Around this time Sczaniecka gave Siegmund a ring inscribed, \\"Poland is still not lost\\" (\\"Noch ist Polen nicht verloren\\"). Emma would wear that ring for the rest of her long life.  Georg Herwegh  By the time she was 25, both Emma's sisters were or had been married. She was not. That she came from a cultured, socially well connected, and unusually wealthy family was widely recognised in the city. Her diaries, gleefully quoted by a biographer, indicate that the men in her social circle were \\"time servers, liberal activists and groupies, low life, philistines, pretty boys, weathercocks, donkeys, dropouts, no-hopers and sycophants\\" (\\"Beamtenseelen, Menschenware, niedertr√§chtige Gesellschaft, Schufte, Philister, liberales Pack, Sch√∂ngeister, Windbeutel, Esel, entmarkte Gesellen, H√∂flinge, Speichellecker.\\"). She had a powerful crush on the young diplomat, Jean- Jacques Jules Piaget, who married her younger sister, Fanny, and she was devastated when he died suddenly in 1840. On 28 October 1841, Emma Siegmund got her hands on a copy of \\"Gedichte eines Lebendigen\\" (loosely \\"Poems of one who is alive\\"), a poetry collection by the young Stuttgart poet Georg Herwegh, who was living in political exile in Switzerland. The little volume had been promptly banned by the authorities, despite which (or possibly because of which) it had become a bestseller. Like many of her generation, she found herself fired up by the verses that evoked unity among all people and called for revolution. \\"That is the answer my soul was missing\\" (\\"Das ist die Antwort auf meine Seele!\\"), she is said to have cried out.Michail Krausnick: Die eiserne Lerche. Georg Herwegh, Dichter und Rebell. Signal-Verlag, Baden-Baden 1970, , S. 40. Her image of this noble poet became a focus in her diary entries and she set about engineering a meeting with her new \\"favourite bard\\". She was in love ‚Äì albeit platonically at this stage ‚Äì with a man she had never met. Siegmund discovered that during the late summer of 1842 Herwegh had planned a celebrity tour of Germany, which would include Berlin. He was looking for people to work on a new project to be centred round a newspaper, \\"Deutschen Boten aus ser Schweiz\\" (\\"German messages from Switzerland\\"), intended, it has been suggested, to get around the press censorship in Prussia. As he toured the cities he was widely feted. Getting near him was no simple matter. Nevertheless, helped by her friend Charlotte Guticke (who herself later married Max Duncker), Siegmund managed, at an art exhibition, to get close enough to Herwegh to speak with him. That turned into a meal together followed by a succession of increasingly excited daily diary entries. Georg Herwegh and Emma Siegmund became engaged on or before 13 November 1842. During his visit, Herwegh was also given an audience with King Frederick William IV whose curiosity had been aroused. The encounter was more an exchange of views than a meeting of minds. At the end of it the king murmured, \\"I know we are enemies, but I must be true to my profession, we want to be honest enemies\\" (\\"\\"Ich wei√ü, wir sind Feinde, aber ich muss nun mal bei meinem Handwerk bleiben, wir wollen ehrliche Feinde sein.\\" \\") and signaled the end of their meeting. Directly following the audience, he ordered a ban on \\"Deutschen Boten aus ser Schweiz\\". The lovers spent Christmas at the Siegmund family home in Berlin. In December 1842, the king became aware that Herwegh had published an open letter complaining about the political situation in Germany, and ordered that the literary trouble maker be expelled from the kingdom. On 26 December 1842, Hervegh was marched to a police station and given 24 hours to leave the country. It was partly as a result of pressure from the government in Vienna but partly, also, as a result of King Frederick William's appreciation of the dangers represented by the popularity of Georg Herwegh, that there was now a more general tightening up of censorship in Prussia and elsewhere in the German confederation. Herwegh had used his German trip to meet at some length with Heinrich Heine, and as he hastened back to Switzerland he found time to stop off in Leipzig to meet with his friend (and political ally) Mikhail Bakunin who was staying in the city. Emma had not wished to be separated from her fianc√©, and the two of them traveled to Leipzig together. At the station, their fellow revolutionary, Bakunin awaited them. However, they were also awaited by a Saxon police officer who served Herwegh with an expulsion order without even permitting him to leave the main railway station. The entire experience appears to have crystallised in Emma a dislike of Prussia which would never leave her. Now the lovers really were parted, and for the next two months their relationship was intensively pursued (and thereby documented) by correspondence. At the start of February 1843, Emma was informed by a mutual friend, Ludwig Follen that Herwegh, now back in Z√ºrich, was ill. Friends were convinced that only Emma's presence could save him from further decline. She also became aware that her letters to him, and his to her, were taking a remarkably long time to arrive. Later, she established the reason: the letters were being intercepted and read by government censors not just in Berlin, but also by other governments along the way. She reacted to Follen's information on her fianc√© by immediately setting off for Z√ºrich, where she arrived by stage coach, accompanied by her (already a widow for more than five years) elder sister, Minna Caspari, and by her father, on 23 February 1843. Georg Herwegh and Emma Siegmund were married on 8 March 1843 at Baden (Aargau), an hour or so down the valley from Z√ºrich. An official exclusion order from the Canton of Z√ºrich had come into effect sooner than expected, but in the adjacent Canton of Aargau the cantonal president was happy for the marriage to be contracted, noting that he was \\"delighted, through this authorisation, to be able to demonstrate that there ..[were].. still cantons in Switzerland that had not fallen prey to the spies\\". Guests attending numbered various German born (and other) political exiles as well as several originally German successful medical men: they included Adolf Ludwig Follen, Friedrich and Caroline Schulz, Jakob Henle, Karl von Pfeufer and, as the couple's groomsman Michail Bakunin. In April, they took their honey moon in southern France and Italy. There is also mention of a political meeting in Geneva with two \\"artisan communists\\" called Weitling and Becker, and of a bathing holiday in Ostend. The couple evidently intended to remain in Switzerland, paying several hundred Swiss francs to the municipality of Augst and several hundred more francs to the cantonal authorities of Basel-Land for the authorisations needed to do so. By the time they died, the investment would probably have appeared worthwhile, but in September 1843 the couple moved to Paris, the city identified in sources as \\"the waiting room for the [next] revolution\\", where their first child, Horace, was born three days short of 1844, and where, between 1843 and 1848, Emma became, among other things, a \\"salonni√®re\\" - the hostess of a politically engaged \\"salon\\". Regular visitors included Heinrich Heine, George Sand, Victor Hugo, Franz Liszt, the Countess d'Agoult , Ivan Turgenev, Alphonse de Lamartine and Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger. During the 1840s, there was growing nervousness on the part of the rulers in central and eastern Europe that they might yet suffer the fate suffered by Louis XVI. There was not the widescale state mandated arrest killing of political opponents that would become mainstream a century later, but in Austria, Prussia and most of the rest of Germany, potential revolutionaries were subjected to growing levels of state surveillance and their publications attracted increasingly effective censorship. By the time the Herweghs arrived there, Paris had become home to approximately 30,000 German political exiles. These included Arnold Ruge as well as Karl and Jenny Marx. Karl Marx and Georg Herwege, both of them newly married writers, closely aligned politically and both new fathers, formed a particular bond, although Emma, again heavily pregnant and hoping to see a little more of her husband, blocked the suggestion from Ruge that the three families should all live together in a \\"living community\\" (\\"Wohngemeinschaft\\") with shared kitchen facilities. The Herwegh marriage had its stormy periods. In Paris, for a time, Emma found Marie d'Agoult becoming a serious rival for her husbands' affections, and there would later be times when the couple lived apart, but the partnership nevertheless endured.  1848  The long-awaited revolution broke out, in Germany, in March 1848. In his Paris exile Georg Herwegh was still a principal focus of revolutionary awareness. A second volume of \\"Gedichte eines Lebendigen\\" (loosely \\"Poems of one who is alive\\"), published in 1843 had sharpened up his revolutionary credentials with his target readership. Against the repeated entreaties of his more pragmatic friend and neighbour, Karl Marx, Herwegh hurriedly assembled a small group of armed radicals and marched off to join the small improvised army around Friedrich Hecker in Baden. He was accompanied by his wife, reportedly the only woman in an armed band of 650, whose passion for the enterprise was no less intense than his. For her the coming revolution was a shared struggled, not merely for democracy in Germany, but for the liberation of Poland from the increasingly oppressive tyranny being imposed on \\"Congress Poland\\" by Czar Nicholas, who had become a particular hate figure for her. (The czar's mother had been born a princess of W√ºrttemberg, less than a day's march from Karlsruhe, the avowed destination of the armed revolutionary group which Georg Herwegh had assembled.) As the little force from Paris reached Alsace, Emma Herwegh undertook at least one covert mission from Strasbourg across the river to make contact with Hecker's force in order to co-ordinate a coming together of the two forces. In the event, however, Karl Marx's prognosis proved correct. Herwegh's Legion of German democrats arrived in Strasbourg having failed to attract the French government backing that they had hoped for. While the force waited in Strasbourg Emma Herwegh, disguised as a stylishly attired teenage boy and armed with two daggers, successfully made contact with Friedrich Hecker in Baden to find only a lukewarm welcome for the support offered. By the end of April the Hecker uprising had been defeated before any coming together with Herwegh's group could be effected, and on 28 April 1848, near Dossenbach (a little upriver of Basel), Herwegh's force was routed by a company of W√ºrttemberg infantry. Despite a reward of 4,000 Gulden being offered for Georg's capture, he and Emma escaped with their lives and, disguised as peasants, fled across the river into Switzerland, heading initially to Geneva. By 1849 they appear to have been back in Paris. Georg Herwegh, whose extremism had been exaggerated in government propaganda, and who never captured the support of the moderate majority among the reformers in the region, found himself widely ridiculed while Emma was disinherited by her father whose business interests in Berlin had, since 1842, been badly affected by his daughter's very public displays of revolutionary passion.  Exile  Cut off from Siegmund family funding, the Herweghs faced the challenge of supporting themselves at their accustomed level. A solution suggested itself in the form of Alexander Herzen, a fellow revolutionary who still had access to significant funding. The Herweghs and the Herzens moved together to Nice in the early 1850s, sharing a house. However, Herwegh had not taken the precaution of telling his friend that half a year earlier he had embarked on an intense love affair with Natalia, Herzen's wife. The love affair with Natalia broke Georg's friendship with Herzen who threatened to challenge Hervegh to a duel, before relocating to London. Natalia died, together with her newborn child, from tuberculosis in 1852.E H Carr, The Romantic Exiles (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books, 1949) p 91. The affair with Natalia Herzen - much publicised by the enraged Herzen in the radical political circles in which the Herweghs moved - appears to have led to a two-year separation, during which Emma relocated to Genoa. Here she became involved with various patriotic activists, most notably forming a close friendship with Felice Orsini who would later achieve wider notability as a would-be assassin of the French emperor. Some sources imply a romantic attachment between Orsini and Emma Herwegh, but the matter is one in respect of which it becomes impossible to disentangle the factual from the fanciful. She did, in any event, became a steadfast and at times a usefully practical supporter of the patriotic adventurer. In 1854, she organised a false passport in the name of \\"Tito Celsi\\" for him. Two years later, with Orsini in jail, she sent him a coat with buttons containing an intoxicant intended for use to put his jailers out of action. When that failed, in March 1856, she conspired with others to smuggle hacksaw blades (hidden in a book) and bed sheets into a Mantua prison cell where Orsini was being held, enabling him to escape custody and the threat of possible execution. In May 1853, Georg and Emma Herwegh resumed their cohabitation, settling together in Z√ºrich, where Emma again became a \\"salonni√®re\\", and hostess to some of Europe's most high-profile radical intellectuals. An alternative or complementary view is that the Herweghs' Z√ºrich home became a sanctuary for political refugees from all over Europe. Her family resumed financial support, and she also earned money by undertaking translations of works by French, Polish or Italian authors into German. The couple remained in Z√ºrich till 1866 when, following a general political amnesty, they moved to Baden-Baden. not too far from where Georg had grown up. Around the same time the couple's financial situation took a turn for the worse: Emma's inheritance seems finally to have been exhausted, and one reason given for leaving Z√ºrich was the need to get away from people to whom they owed money. They stayed in Baden-Baden till 1875, when Georg Herwegh died from Pneumonia. It was important to the couple that his body should be buried \\"in republican earth\\" and it was accordingly returned to the Canton of Basel for burial in the cemetery at Liestal.  Paris  Emma Herwegh now returned to Paris where she supported herself as a languages tutor and translator. There are indications that she also received some financial support from friends. Although she lived in relative poverty, she was able to move in \\"intellectual circles\\". It was in Paris that she died, in March 1904. Her body was buried at Liestal \\"in free republican earth\\", beside that of her husband. ==References== Category:People from Magdeburg Category:German writers Category:People of the Revolutions of 1848 Category:German feminists Category:German salon-holders Category:German letter writers Category:Women letter writers Category:1817 births Category:1904 deaths Category:19th-century women writers ","title":"Emma Herwegh"},{"id":"56126028","text":"The Capitol Hill Branch is a branch of the Seattle Public Library in the Capitol Hill, Seattle neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, US. The original library, located at Harvard Avenue and Republican Street, opened in 1954 and was named the Susan J. Henry Branch at the request of its benefactor. The Henry Branch was demolished in 2001 and the modern Capitol Hill Branch was opened at the same location in 2003. ==History== The original site of the library was formerly Emma Baillargeon Stimson's large home, whose purchase was partly funded by the sale of another Capitol Hill property donated in 1934 to the city by two sons of Horace Chapin Henry and Susan J. Henry. Both Henry and Stimson families were early Seattle businesspeople and philanthropists, and Emma Stimson was granddaughter of John Collins, another wealthy businessperson and one of the first mayors of Seattle. A new building designed by NBBJ opened as the Susan J. Henry Branch on August 26, 1954. The Washington Talking Book & Braille Library (then the Library for the Blind and serving Washington, Montana and Alaska) was housed in the building's basement until 1973. The citywide \\"Libraries for All\\" initiative was approved by voters in 1998, funding the replacement of older and smaller libraries, including the Henry Branch. In October 1999, after two public meetings, the Seattle Library Board voted to build a new branch on the current site of the Henry Branch. The Library Board rejected an offer from a private developer that sought to put the new library branch in a mixed-use development at Broadway and 10th Avenue East, after public opposition to the height of the building. The Henry Branch closed on November 3, 2001, and was demolished. A new $5 million building designed by Cutler Anderson Architects opened on the same site on May 31, 2003. Under city regulations, new libraries could not be named for individuals so it was named Capitol Hill Branch.From informative display inside Capitol Hill Branch In its first year, the new library handled 58 percent more patrons compared to the old branch. ==Architecture and construction== Unobstructed reading room and mezzanine, featuring two story south-facing glass wall The 21st century building incorporates a green wall on a steel mesh trellis and other calming features visible from the unobstructed interior with large glass expanses and south light. The exterior mortar joints are trowel struck to give the exterior a monolithic appearance. The basement has an 18-stall parking garage. The design team, led by Ray Johnston and James Cutler, described the building as a reflection of the urban corridor of Broadway as well as the wooded residential areas of the neighborhood. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Seattle Public Library main branch in-library viewing only ==External links== * Category:Public libraries in Washington (state) Category:Library buildings completed in 2003 Category:Libraries in Seattle Category:Capitol Hill, Seattle Category:Seattle Public Library Category:2003 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Capitol Hill Branch Library"},{"id":"56126037","text":"Christmas in Compton is a 2012 Christmas comedy film starring Keith David and Omar Gooding. It was directed by David Raynr. == Plot == Derrick is an aspiring music producer whose major accomplishment is the discovery of DJ Killionaire, an artist now generating millions for record executive Tommy Maxell. Derrick feels cheated by Maxell when he does not receive his believed share of the profits due to fine print in the contract. His lack of income leads to a fight with his father Big Earl, the owner of a children's academy as well as a Christmas tree lot in Compton, California, during the week before Christmas. Big Earl suffers a heart attack and during his recovery he signs documents giving Derrick co-ownership of the house and the Christmas tree lot in an attempt to teach him responsibility. When Maxell threatens steal female trio Sugar Stuff out from Derrick's management, Derrick seeks revenge on Maxell by posing as an exterminator and robbing a $300,000 pink diamond ring from Maxell's house. He attempts to sell the stolen ring through the intermediary Delicious, a pawn shop owner, but the first prospective buyer is a local criminal who attempts to rob the ring and has to be chased off. Urgently in need of money in order to extend Sugar Stuff's contract, Derrick puts up the Christmas tree lot as collateral for a $150,000 loan from loan shark Ernesto Martinez, who demands repayment and an additional $25,000 in interest by Christmas Eve. Tommy Maxell buys the loan from Ernesto Martinez in order to take the Christmas tree lot as collateral and also hires criminals to steal back the ring from Delicious. Derrick and his friends go on a promotional frenzy for Sugar Stuff by selling their CD all over Compton in order to push their contract price up so that Maxwell will be convinced to tear up the loan in return for being allowed to sign Sugar Stuff to his label. They get involved in a car crash with a local hustler who listens to their story in prison and is moved to help them because his nephew attends Big Earl's academy. His crew rapidly distributes Sweet Stuff's CDs to the local radio stations and distributes their music on iTunes, quickly earning over $100,000. Big Earl forces Derrick to sign back ownership of the Christmas tree lot to him, but the papers are actually for ownership of Sweet Stuff. Big Earl negotiates with Maxell, who agrees to build a community center on the lot and employ Derrick as a producer for the artists on the label in return for ownership of the lot and the ability to sign Sweet Stuff to his label. Big Earl says that he will simply take the money that was made that day and buy another lot with it. == Cast == * Ayo Adeyemi as African Drummer * Charlotte Ayanna as Ginger * Kamilah Barrett as Dancer * Alycia Bellamy as Shante * Jayda Brown as Sierra * Orlando Brown as Tyrone * Christopher Carroll as Butler * Luke Christopher as himself * Porscha Coleman as Kendra Campbell * Melanie Comarcho as Quanita * Keith David as Big Earl * Marcos De Silvas as Ernesto Martinez * Kristinia DeBarge as Lola * Fefe Dobson as Kim * Michael Duncan as Michael Duncan * Omar Gooding as Derrick Hollander * Cynthia Graham as Mrs. Hubbard * Reegan Haynes as Dancer * Edwin Hodge as Pookie * Spencer Hubbard as DJ Killionaire * Budd Jackson as Heckler * Leslie Jones as Tiny * Don \\"Magic\\" Juan as Donald Campbell * Charles Kim as Steve Ho * Arif S.

If Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n are complex-valued random variables, then the n-tuple \\\\left( Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n \\\\right) is a complex random vector. Complex random variables can always be considered as pairs of real random vectors: their real and imaginary parts. Some concepts of real random vectors have a straightforward generalization to complex random vectors. For example, the definition of the mean of a complex random vector. Other concepts are unique to complex random vectors. Applications of complex random vectors are found in digital signal processing. ==Definition== A complex random vector \\\\mathbf{Z} = (Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n)^T on the probability space (\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},P) is a function \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\colon \\\\Omega \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n such that the vector (\\\\Re{(Z_1)},\\\\Im{(Z_1)},\\\\ldots,\\\\Re{(Z_n)},\\\\Im{(Z_n)})^T is a real real random vector on (\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},P) where \\\\Re{(z)} denotes the real part of z and \\\\Im{(z)} denotes the imaginary part of z. ==Cumulative distribution function== The generalization of the cumulative distribution function from real to complex random variables is not obvious because expressions of the form P(Z \\\\leq 1+3i) make no sense. However expressions of the form P(\\\\Re{(Z)} \\\\leq 1, \\\\Im{(Z)} \\\\leq 3) make sense.

The monument takes the form of an octagonal shaft surmounted by a stone critself mountedunted on a two-stepped square base surmounted by a square-sectioned pinth, with shaped angles. The front face is inscribed with eight names, dedicated to the men from the civil parish of Bow Brickhill who died in the First World War (1914-1918). The other faces are inscribed with the names of men who served in the First World War and the upper step of the base has five names, men who died in the Second World War (1939-1945). ==Notable People== Gerald Featherstone Knight, grandson of the rector of Bow Brickhill, was a captain in the Royal Flying Corps who died of cancer on 30 October 1919, aged 25. Knight was posthumously awarded the Military Cross for his gallantry in escaping from captivity.

The troops of Napoleon Bonaparte (Volodymyr Zelensky) are triumphantly advancing around the country. Napoleon already managed to conquer Europe and capture Moscow. Now, the next step in his plan is to win the battle for the Russian capital, St. Petersburg. Chances for the Russian army to resist the French enemy are extremely small as they are too weak and not prepared. General Kutuzov (Vladimir Simonov) knows that if for some reason Napoleon lingers in Moscow, his army will win valuable time and get a better chance of victory. Only a mysterious Russian woman could distract womanizing Napoleon from his plans to conquer the world. Kutuzov sets off on the challenging task of looking for a suitable candidate. Lieutenant Rzhevsky (Pavel Derevyanko) is perhaps the most famous tempter in Russia. Now he is serving a life sentence for promoting the sexual revolution. Like Bonaparte, Rzhevsky has an unrivaled skill in enchanting women.

It is an active Church of England parish church in the deanery of Mansfield, the Archdeaconry of Newark, and the Southwell and Nottingham diocese. Its benefice has three churches, St Edmund‚Äôs is the main parish church, also the Church of St Chad, Pleasley Vale and the Community Church on the Peafield Lane Estate. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. St Edmund's Church is partnered with nearby St Edmund's C of E Primary School. In the 1980s the school moved to its current site at Church Hill Avenue, Mansfield Woodhouse. The original building, on Welbeck Road leading down from the church, still stands and is Grade II listed. The Turner Memorial Hall, opposite the church on Church Street, serves as St Edmund's church hall and office, as well as being a community centre and the headquarters of St Edmund's scout group. ==History== Although the church is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, it is possible that a wooden church existed at Mansfield Woodhouse in the 11th century which was destroyed by fire in 1180. A church, part timber and part local limestone, was built in 1190. A fire destroyed the village and much of the church in 1304. Work on rebuilding the church started soon after the fire in 1306. The fire is commemorated with an Appliqu√© wall hanging depicting the village and church burning (2004). The church was reconstructed in 1804-1810 and subsequently heavily restored in 1847-150. This restoration was traditionally attributed to George Gilbert Scott. Pevsner was not particularly impressed by the work, describing the result in the Nottinghamshire volume of his Buildings of England series as, \\"neither original nor sensitive\\". He took particular exception to the spire of the tower, calling it \\"very odd\\" and noting the lucarne windows were \\"so tiny that they look from a distance like a spikey finial\\". Pevsner followed tradition and ascribed the building's mid-19th century reconstruction to Scott. During an assessment of the pews in St Edmund's Church by Historic England in 2007, the nineteenth century restorations of the building were re-attributed to W B Moffatt and T C Hine, rather than to Scott. ==External features== The churchyard surrounds the church on all four sides, with numerous mature trees and stone boundary walls to all sides. The boundary wall facing Church Street is Grade II listed. The churchyard also contains three gravestones and a sarcophagus which are Grade II listed: Boundary Wall At Church of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse *Sarcophagus 10 metres south of south porch at Church of St Edmund Sarcophagus 10 metres south of south porch at Church of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse *Headstone and chest tomb 10 metres south of chancel at Church of St Edmund Headstone and chest tomb 10 metres south of chancel at Church of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse *Headstone 3 metres south of Lady Chapel at Church of St Edmund Headstone 3 metres south of Lady Chapel at Church of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse *Headstone 28 metres south of chancel at Church of St Edmund Headstone 28 metres south of chancel at Church of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse The First World War memorial linked to the church is Grade II listed and situated opposite the church on Priory Road at the entrance to Yeoman Hill Park. ==Gallery== Image:St Edmund's Church, Mansfield Woodhouse (5).jpg  Church Of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse Image:Church Of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse (6).jpg  Church Of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse Image:St Edmunds Church, Church Street, Mansfield Woodhouse - Detail of stained glass windows to the Church Street End at dusk 01.jpg  Church Of St Edmund, stained glass windows at dusk Image:St Edmunds Church, Church Street, Mansfield Woodhouse - Detail of stained glass windows to the Church Street End at dusk 02.jpg  Church Of St Edmund, stained glass windows at dusk Image:St Edmunds Church, Church Street, Mansfield Woodhouse - Detail of stained glass windows to the Church Street End at dusk 03.jpg  Church Of St Edmund, stained glass windows at dusk ==See also== *Grade I listed buildings in Nottinghamshire *Grade II* listed buildings in Nottinghamshire == References Sources== * Mansfield Woodhouse Mansfield Woodhouse Mansfield Woodhouse Category:Mansfield ","title":"Church of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse"},{"id":"56126522","text":"Nether Hall is a large mansion in Doncaster.

It became a private school in the 1870s and then became the headquarters of the Queen's Own Yorkshire Dragoons in the early 20th century. The regiment was mobilised at Nether Hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front. The hall was decommissioned after the war and acquired by Doncaster Rural District Council in 1921; a rear wing was built for use as a council chamber. Following the Local Government Act 1974 the hall was used to accommodate the finance department of the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster.

As of 2017, he is research professor at Bard College in New York. == Career == He studied physics and earth sciences at Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, before getting a master of arts (MA) degree, MPhil, and a PhD on mathematical physics at Columbia University. His Ph.D thesis at Columbia was titled Coupling of deep water formation and the general circulation : a case study of the Red Sea. Eshel was then a postdoctoral NOAA Climate & Global Change (C&GC;) Fellow at the Harvard Department for Earth & Planetary Physics, a Staff Scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and also a faculty member of department of geophysics at the University of Chicago.. Eshel also advises Bluefield Technologies on livestock methane emissions. == Research == Gidon Eshel's early research found that the mean American diet that is rich in animal products such as red meat releases more carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere than a lacto-ovo vegetarian, poultry-based, pescatarian, or vegan diet.\\"Rethinking the American Diet\\". Radcliffe Magazine. Compared with a plant-based diet, the mean American diet results in 1,500 kilograms of CO2 per person annually. He has campaigned against beef consumption as cattle grazing increases greenhouse gas production and negative environmental impacts such as wildlife displacement, soil erosion and damage to river systems.\\"Grass-Fed Beef ‚Äì bad for us and for the planet\\". Vegetarians of Washington. He has commented that \\"save going all-out vegan, the most impactful change that you can make is to ditch beef altogether and replace it with poultry‚Äîjust beef to poultry\\". Recent examples of his work compare several livestock and land and water use, fertiliser-based water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions per factor unit of product. His highest cited paper is \\"Forecasting Zimbabwean maize yield using eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature\\" at 445 times, according to Google Scholar. In 2019, it was reported in the Scientific American that Eshel and his colleagues published findings in the Nature journal which found that \\"if all Americans switched away from meat, it would eliminate the need for pastureland and reduce the amount of high-quality cropland under cultivation by as much as 25 percent.\\"\\"These Plants Can Replace Meat‚Äîbut Will Doing So Help the Environment?\\". Scientific American.

Preusse maintained a long and successful business partnership with fellow Gean architect Julius Zittel Preusse was born in Germany in 1847. After his architectural studies he came to the U.S. in 1870 and settled in Spokane Falls in 1882. He designed many of the buildings destroyed by the Great Spokane Fire of 1889 including the Frankfurt, Boston, and Post Office blocks. He went on to design the Blalock and Ziegler buildings, a large Auditorium Theatre with what was once largest stage in the U.S., the Granite Block, the Victoria Hotel, and one of the first buildings at Gonzaga University. Hisbhigh profile clients included Edward Herbert Jamieson, Herman A. Van Valkenburg, and Samuel J. Holland. The Northern Pacific Railroad helped bring commerce to the Northwest. Mining also drew development to the area. Spokane Falls hired Preusse to help plan the development of the area. Preusse joined with fellow German architect Julius Zittel who started as a draghtsman for Preusse in 1887 before they became business partners in 1893 at Preuss & Zittel. Zittel went on to be Washington's state architect and they collaborated for many years.

Taken together with its post-war extensions, which run to the former county borough boundary, it is the largest park in the city. ==History== Barnes Park was laid out in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The land for Barnes Park, set in a beautiful valley through which the Bishopwearmouth Burn flows, was bought in 1904 for the sum ¬£8,500. Three years later, when the depression of trade struck in 1907, the laying out of the park was started ‚Äì this became a source of employment for a number of practical gardeners from the area, with a total of 2,798 men being employed. The park was then opened in August 1909. Many of the established trees were retained with oak, ash, beech and elm trees constituting its main wooded growth. Paths meandered throughout the park in all directions and at the west side, on the most elevated piece of ground, two bowling greens, tennis courts, and a cafe were established. The park has since been home to a wide range of wildlife and with nesting boxes being provided, breeding birds have regularly returned to the park over the years. Water hens, starlings, linnets, snipes, tits, diving ducks, and chaffinches can be frequently observed. Restoration After a two-year bidding process, the Sunderland City Council secured over ¬£3 million in Heritage Lottery funding to restore the historic features of Barnes Park and to redevelop its amenities for future generations. Brambledown have been appointed the main contractors in the restoration. ==ReferencesSee also== *Mowbray Park Category:Parks and open spaces in Tyne and Wear Category:Urban public parks in the United Kingdom Category:Tourist attractions in the City of Sunderland Category:Sunderland ","title":"Barnes Park"},{"id":"56126677","text":"Dorea longicatena is a Gram-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacterium from the genus of Dorea which has been isolated from human feces in Germany. == References == Category:Lachnospiraceae Category:Bacteria described in 2002 ","title":"Dorea longicatena"},{"id":"56126710","text":"Ipolysz√∂g is a village in N√≥gr√°d County, Northern Hungary Region, Hungary. ==References== Category:Populated places in N√≥gr√°d County ","title":"Ipolysz√∂g"},{"id":"56126725","text":"Haddenham war memorial and village pond Haddenham War Memorial is located in Church End, Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, England.Haddenham.

Though that first attempt only resulted in the hurling of a 103-pound rock three feet, by 1977, the year of the final National Catapult Contest, teams had successfully built authentic Roman catapults that routinely hurled rocks as heavy as 50 and 75 pounds more than 200 yards.Catapult Design Construction & Competition, written by Bernard F. Barcio, published by Pompeiiana, Inc., 1978 ==History== The National Catapult Contest originated out of a simple directive from the Academic Development Committee of Indianapolis' Park School for Boys (now Park Tudor School) in December 1965, which \\"urged the faculty to review continuously the content and method of their instruction,\\" and \\"further, not to forego unusual methods of stimulating the interest and involvement of students.\\" Acting on this directive, Bernard F. Barcio, then the Latin Master of the school, announced to his class that he would support them in the undertaking of a project of their choice, so long as it pertained somehow to Latin. According to Barcio, \\"It was then that sophomore David Leve suggested that the Latin II class (thirteen members in all) build an authentic Roman Catapult.\\"From The History of the National Catapult Contest, Catapult Design Construction & Competition, Page 5 Under Barcio's leadership, a student team consisting of Andy SerVaas, David Leve, Mike Ryan, John Townsend, Geoff Reynolds, Richard Vonnegut, Laurel Woodard, John Katterjohn and Russ Staines\\" proceeded to undergo the construction of a catapult powered by rope and a 12-foot-long wooden bow.  Failure to Launch  Interest in the unusual project quickly spread through the school, and the larger community. The students predicted their catapult would be able to hurl a 100-pound rock 100 yards. The school even dubbed March 8, 1966, as their first annual \\"rock gathering day,\\" which they used to locate a suitable projectile for the planned first firing of the war machine. Students eventually found \\"a 103-pound granite boulder\\" suitable for the purpose, which they named \\"Gaul Blaster.\\" On March 15, 1966, the entire school, including parents, administrators and alumni, led by Mr. Barcio, marched out to the field in front of the school to fire the catapult. National media was present to record the event. Following a dramatic drum roll and bugle call by the Marian College bugle corp, the students fired the machine. The wooden bow sprang forward, emitting \\"an ominous cracking sound.\\" Instead of flying 100 yards through the air, Gaul Blaster rolled pitifully off the bow, landing three feet in front of the catapult. Rather than deeming the event a failure, Barcio designated three feet as the first official modern world catapult record.From The History of the National Catapult Contest, Catapult Design Construction & Competition, Page 6  More media coverage  Over the eleven years of the National Catapult Contest, the event was covered multiple times by national news media outlets.YouTube footage of NBC news coverage of the National Catapult Contest In addition to the Huntley-Brinkley Report, it was covered by Patrick Trese, a sports reporter for NBC, and appeared on NBC News First Tuesday, hosted by Sander Vanocur, in 1969, and 1970, as well as on the NBC Chronolog series in 1971, and 1972.From Media Coverage of Catapulting, Catapult Design Construction & Competition, Page 99 David Dortch and Mary Hyde, winners of the first and fifth National Catapult Contests, respectively, appeared on the American Broadcasting Company program To Tell the Truth. Sports Illustrated covered the National Catapult Contest twice, once in a brief article in 1970, and again in a full-length feature article titled \\"First among Those Who Cast Stones,\\" written by Bruce Newman.Sports Illustrated, June 7, 1976, pp. 64‚Äì66 The Catpult Contest was also covered in Seventeen Magazine in May 1975, in an article titled \\"Catapult Fever...Hurling Boulders Is the Latest Craze.\\"[ https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/1975-seventeen-magazine-peter- falk-171016705 Seventeen Magazine, May 1975, article index] ==Chronology== March 15, 1966 Mars I (bentwood bow) built on the former Park School campus on Colds Spring Road in the basement of the gym. The idea evolved in Bernard Barcio‚Äôs nine-member Latin II Class at the suggestion of David Leve (‚Äô68). Fired on the Ides of March, and covered by local media and by NBC producer Pat Trese, whose award-winning footage was shown on National News that same evening. A cracked bow allows the Gaul Blaster (rock) to only go 3 feet. Members of the class included John Katterjohn (Phillopos), David Leve (Oinophilos), Geoff Reynolds (Peracles), Mike Ryan (Alexandros), Andy Servaas (Odysseus), Russ Staines (Hector), John Townsend (Eros), Richard Vonnegut (Heracles), and Laurel Woodard (Homeros). October 1, 1966 The Mars I is improved with a new bow and a sling, and Latin students traveled to Guelph, Ontario, Canada for the Centennial Celebration of the 11th Field Artillery Regiment. A bowling ball covered in plaster is fired 40 feet. (Bernard Barcio is now 28 years old) March 15, 1967 Cold Springs Road Campus: ‚Äú2 p.m. festivities, culminating in the Second Annual Firing of Mars I.‚Äù (Park School weekly schedule) March 15, 1968 After Park School moves to its new campus at Lilly Orchard, The Latin students once again fire the improved Mars I. The catapult is then put on display outside the parking lot entrance to the new Gymnasium, along with the original Gaul Blaster rock, which was stolen shortly afterwards. The original bow was displayed with a commemorative plaque on the wall outside Mr. Barcio‚Äôs Latin classroom at the north end of the first floor in what is now the Lower School Building. The bow was later put in storage but has since been misplaced. March 15, 1969 Park fires the Mars I catapult, with its new bow, for a final time. March 14, 1970 Culver returns to the new campus, where a large parade precedes the competition. Park Latin students participating in the parade and firing of the Mars II catapult were: Lee Alig (Artemedorus), Fritz Anderson (Cinna), Kent Baker (Brutus), Charles Bookwalter (Hippocrates), Gary Cohen (Casca), Will Gould (Decius), Lance Hamilton (Caesar), Doug Hughes (Pulsator II), John Kimble (Metellus), Ed King (Sisyphus), Blaise Morton (Euripides), Tom Moses (Popilius), David Noling (Ermes), Jay Nyhart (Oedipos), Steve Scofield (Idiotes), John Simon (Pulsator I), Mark Thomas (Cassius), Karl Tauer (Zeus), and Clinton White (Achilles). The competition is covered in a brief article in Sports Illustrated (April 6, 1970) and again by Pat Trese for NBC First Tuesday. At the end of the school year, Mr. Barcio leaves Park for North Central H.S. March 15, 1971 Park School for Boys merges with Tudor Hall for Girls to form Park-Tudor School. Latin Classes are now co-ed and on January 25, the students challenge Mr. Barcio‚Äôs North Central Latin students to compete on the Park-Tudor campus on the Ides of March. Park-Tudor Latin Students issuing the challenge signed only their Greek and Latin class names: Plato, Idiotes, Achilles I, Oedipus, Esipus, Appolodorus, Helena, Socrates, Nemo, Geminus, Eandros, Hermes I, Euripides, Zeus, Achilles II, Eros, Benigra, Hermes II, Alexandros and Aristotle. Their Latin teachers were signed as D. Coclea and A. Minimevadus. Mr. Barcio‚Äôs students build a new trebuchet, called Pacator. David Dortch (Spanish student) builds his own machine, the Ares I and defeats Park and North Central at the Park School Invitational. The event is covered on NBC Chronolog. The contest is also featured in the Britannica Review of Foreign Language Education (1971, pp. 201‚Äì2), and in Campus Life magazine (March 1972). April 22, 1972 Culver Military Academy hosts First National Catapult Contest on its campus in Marshall County, IN. Park-Tudor‚Äôs Spiro and Ares II, and North Central‚Äôs Pacator, Magnus Fiz and Hylus catapults are transported by the US Army Reserve at the invitation of the Pentagon. Thirteen Indiana catapult teams compete in a festival atmosphere, while eight more in three other states call in their achievements. David Dortch of Park-Tudor wins the 1st National Catapult Contest with his newly designed Ares II. David is invited to appear on ABC‚Äôs To Tell the Truth, and the contest is once again covered on NBC Chronolog. April 14, 1973 After competing at Culver, the Park-Tudor and NCHS Catapults are reassembled on Stafford Road (off Kessler Blvd) on property owned by Washington Township Schools. Innovation and competition continue ‚Äúoff campus‚Äù as other schools from central Indiana and Kentucky join the Invitational. Nationwide, 32 catapults were constructed in eleven states. Although David Dortch‚Äôs Ares II performed well, firing a 10-pound rock 583 ft., Ft. Wayne H.S., wins the 2nd National Catapult Contest with its massive twisted rope catapult named Imperator. The competition is featured in Outdoor Indiana (1973), in The Stentor (published by the Michigan Classical Conference), in The Classical Outlook (February 1974), and in Campus Life Magazine (November 1973). May 11, 1974 The contest, now sponsored by Pompeiiana, incorporated by Mr. Barcio with the help of Allen Clowes, Carl Dortch and Philip Kappes, is held on the Stafford Road catapult field as schools from around Indiana try to set new records, with the hope that some school‚Äôs catapult may eventually achieve the original goal of hurling a 100-pound rock 100 yards. Park-Tudor students enter their catapults Anteres and Phoenix I. Latin students in Pascagoula, MS, set a world record with their bent wood catapult, Rebelorum, firing a 1-pound spear 668 feet. Ft. Wayne H.S.‚Äôs Imperator wins the 3rd National Catapult Contest. NCHS Latin student, Mary Hyde, begins construction on her 30-foot trebuchet (reaching an overall height of 61 feet), called Zephyrus, but takes two more years to complete her machine. May 10, 1975 The contest is once again held on the Stafford Road catapult field. Wayne H.S.‚Äôs Imperator sets two records, hurling a 20-pound rock 369 feet, and a 30-pound rock 280 ft. Wayne H.S. Latin students win the Forth National Catapult Contest. North Central‚Äôs Mary Hood continues to work on Zephyrus. The contest is featured in the magazine Seventeen (May 1975). May 15, 1976 This year 41 machines in seven states competed‚Ä¶ 22 of them in Indianapolis. Mary Hyde completes Zephyrus on the Stafford Road catapult field and sets a record, hurling 75-[pimd rock 623 feet. North Central H.S. Latin students win the Fifth National Catapult Contest. The contest is covered in the New York Times (May 18, 1976, p. 31) and in Sports Illustrated (June 7, 1976, pp. 64 & 66). Mary Hyde is invited to appear on ABC‚Äôs To Tell the Truth. May 14, 1977 Sixth and final year of the Pompeiiana-sponsored National Catapult Competition on the Stafford Road catapult field. Mary Hyde‚Äôs Zephyrus sweeps the national competition, setting all the records for a heavy weight trebuchet, hurling a 10-pound rock 779 feet, and surpassing the goal set in 1966, by hurling Park- Tudor‚Äôs originally rejected \\"Flying Balls Mean Dying Gauls\\" 100-pound rock 579 feet. Unfortunately, there was no local or national coverage of this final competition. Only home movies taken by Mr. Hyde recorded Mary‚Äôs record-setting shots. So long as the Stafford Road field remains undeveloped by Washington Township Schools, catapult remnants will, no doubt, remain visible among the weeds. Although all of Zephyrus‚Äô shots are world records, Guinness declined to publish them because they do not want to encourage such a dangerous activity.

To that end, Bernard F. Barcio, the Latin teacher who had originally founded the project, created a non-profit organization called Pompeiiana, Inc., the goal of which was to promote classical studies at the secondary school level. Pompeiiana managed the contest until after eleven years of competition, the National Catapult Contest ceased official operations in 1977. The following year, Pompeiiana published the first edition of the book Catapult Design, Construction & Competition.Catapult Design, Construction & Competition, First Edition, on ebay This book presents a detailed account of the entire history of this event, including detailed diagrams demonstrating how the various types of catapults were designed and constructed, and a detailed list of records, which includes the participating students and schools, the dates, the weight of projectiles hurled, and the distances achieved. A second edition of the book was later published in paperback in 2006, and titled Catapult Design, Construction and Competition with the Projectile Throwing Engines of the Ancients.Catapult Design, Construction and Competition with the Projectile Throwing Engines of the Ancients on Amazon books == Types of catapults reconstructed ==  Counterweight Trebuchet  This type of catapult uses a swinging arm to hurl a projectile at a target. A cradle for the projectile is attached to the longest section of the arm, and a counterweight is attached to the shorter end. When the weight is released from the frame, it drops and causes the long arm to spring forward, launching the projectile forward. According to the official records of the National Catapult Contest, a catapult of this type named Zephyrus, built by students at North Central High School (Indianapolis), was the catapult that finally achieved the original goal of the projects, which was to hurl a 100-pound rock one hundred yards. In fact, Zephyrus hurled a 100-pound rock 579 feet‚Äînearly twice the goal‚Äîin 1977. Additional Zephyrus records included hurling a 40-pound rock 798 feet, a 50-pound rock 750 feet, and a 75-pound rock 623 feet.From World Records in Catapulting and the Catapults That Have Set Them, Catapult Design Construction & Competition, Page 13  Twisted Rope, or Torsion siege engine  This type of catapult utilized a mechanism similar to that of a cross-bow, with a spring-loaded device attached to ropes. The rope is pulled back and made taut then when triggered, springs forward launching a projectile such as a spear or a stone. In 1977, the twisted rope catapult named Remus II, built by students at Eastwood High School in Indianapolis, set a National Catapult Contest record by hurling a 1-pound spear 701 feet.From World Records in Catapulting and the Catapults That Have Set Them, Catapult Design Construction & Competition, Page 13  Bent Wood  Similar to the trebuchet, the Bent Wood variety of catapult uses a wooden arm to hurl a projectile. In this case, the wooden arm is pulled back, or bent, so that enough tension is built up that when released. A projectile is then set in a cradle at the long end of the arm so when the arm is released, it snaps back into place, hurling the rock forward. Mars I, the first catapult created for this project, was a Bent Wood machine. Records set by Bent Wood catapults during the National Catapult Contests include the Rebelorum machine, built by students at Pascagoula High School in Pascagoula, Mississippi, throwing a one-pound spear 668 feet, three inches in 1974, Horologium Tintinnabulum, built by students at Mauston High School in Maustin, Wisconsin, which hurled a ten-pound rock 96 feet, 8 inches, in 1975, and Machina Gigantum, built by students of Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis, which hurled a one-pound rock 186 feet, three inches, in 1977.From World Records in Catapulting and the Catapults That Have Set Them, Catapult Design Construction & Competition, p. 13 == References == Category:Roman weapons ","title":"National Catapult Contest"},{"id":"56126766","text":"Simmie O.

A. Carleton, the local superintendent of schools. She had two sisters, Truma and Yana; both were schoolteachers, and over twenty years older than she. The house in which they lived lacked indoor plumbing when she was born. Carleton attended Cottey College in Nevada, from which she graduated in 1933.https://www.cottey.edu/pdf/alumnae/awards/distinguished-award-list.pdf She went on to study English and take a master's degree at the University of Missouri. from which she graduated in 1939. While there, she danced and acted in student productions, and in 1936 she was named the school's Poet of the Year. Upon graduation from the university, Carleton moved to Joplin, where she taught at Joplin Junior College. After a short time there she moved again, to Kansas City, where she took a job at WHB writing advertising copy; eventually she was given her own program on the station about local events. While living there she met Jene Lyon, marrying him in 1943. They soon moved to New York City, where Carleton found work as an advertising copywriter, among a variety of other odd jobs. The couple purchased a house in Hoboken, New Jersey, but returned to Nevada for a visit for two weeks every summer. It was these visits which provided the inspiration for the novel The Moonflower Vine, much of which is based on stories from Carleton's family and other residents of the town. The Moonflower Vine was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1962, and proved to be a sensation. It was edited by Robert Gottlieb, who said of it, \\"Of the hundreds upon hundreds of novels I've edited, this is literally the only one I've reread several times since its publication.\\" The novel spent four months on the New York Times bestseller list; it was selected for promotion by two major book clubs, appeared as a Reader's Digest Condensed Book, and was published in eight other countries. Due to its success Cottey presented Carleton with its Distinguished Alumna Award in 1964 for her work. Nevertheless, it remained the only novel which she published during her lifetime. Carleton and her husband moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1970, and opened a publishing house, The Lightning Tree, with the money earned from her novel. Never profitable, it put out poetry, cookbooks, and works on regional history, and kept her too busy to write. During this time she continued with her tradition of visiting family in Nevada every summer. The press folded in 1991, two years before Lyon died. Carleton began work on another novel, The Back Alleys of Spring, based on her experiences teaching in Joplin. She had nearly finished it in 1997, and was preparing to shop it around for publication when she suffered a stroke and hit her head on a stone floor at her house; she was not found for some hours, and ultimately was robbed of her ability to speak. At her death in 1999 her papers went to a nephew in Missouri; the novel was thought lost in a May 2003 tornado, but it had instead been preserved by her literary executor, Larry Calloway, in Santa Fe. The Moonflower Vine fell into obscurity after its initial bout of success. Eventually it was featured on The Neglected Books Page, which provided it with renewed attention. As a result, the novel was republished by Harper Perennial in April 2009, with an introduction by Missouri writer Jane Smiley, an avowed fan of the work. The Back Alleys of Spring was eventually published by the same publisher in 2012, under the title Clair de Lune. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1999 deaths Category:American women novelists Category:20th-century American novelists Category:20th-century American women writers Category:Novelists from Missouri Category:People from Nevada, Missouri Category:Cottey College alumni Category:University of Missouri alumni Category:Missouri Southern State University people ","title":"Jetta Carleton"},{"id":"56126781","text":"Bogger Mushanga (born 6 June 1952) is a Zambian triple jumper.

Cynthia Okogosu was the last child and only daughter of her parents, retired major-general Frank Osokogu and Joy-Rita Nkem Osokogu. She had three elder brothers. Her eldest brother is Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Uchechukwu Osokogu. Her immediate elder brother is an Assistant Superintendent of Customs, Mr. Williams Ehiedu Osokogu. Her third elder brother, Mr. Tony Azubike Osokogu, lived in Greece. She started schooling at the Command Children School, Ilorin and moved to the Command Secondary School, Jos from 1997 to 2004. She was a graduate of English Language at Nasarawa State University and was pursuing a master's degree in Public Administration in the same institution after resigning from a job with MTN. Cynthia was also a former model. She owned a boutique 'Dress Code' which she opened in Keffi, a town in Nasarawa State in 2007. She was described as hardworking, loving and industrious by her family. She had achieved much by age 24. ==Incident== Cynthia developed some friendships via the social networking site Facebook after chatting with a newly added ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, Okwumi Echezona Nwabufor via her BlackBerry Messenger over the pace of about four months and soon she had also \\"friended\\" his cousin, Ezike Ilechukwu Olisaeloka. Even though she already had a relation in the United States who often sent her goods to sell in her retailing business, they told her they were in the same business, that they were also retailers and offered to sell her the items at cheaper prices. She believed them. These young men seemed normal and promised to host Cynthia when she came to Lagos. What Cynthia didn't know was that Nwabufor had been stalking her for months, patiently gaining her confidence through frequent chats and postings. When she informed them she usually comes to buy goods in Lagos, they made arrangements for her visit while promising to help her get the goods at cheaper prices. The trip was organized by Echezona Nwabufor, one of the two new friends. On July 21, 2012, Cynthia flew to Lagos from Abuja to meet with these new \\"retailers\\" regarding the better price offer on the clothes and accessories for her fashion boutique. After landing, she called her mother to tell her that she had arrived safely. The two young men picked Cynthia up from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, and drove her to Cosmilla Hotel in Lakeview estate in Festac Town. At the hotel, they entertained her and offered her a Ribena-brand drink which was pre-drugged with Rohypnol), but discovered the drug did not take effect quickly enough on her. After that, they beat her and asked her to reveal where she kept her money. They presumed she would hold a lot of money, but she said she didn't have any money to spare. When they didn't get any money from her, they tied her up, robbed her of all the money she brought to shop for her business, her three blackberry phones, jewelries, international passport, a drivers‚Äô licence, then they raped her and finally strangled her to death. The next morning, after having spent the night with Cynthia's body, they then abandoned her, left the hotel and quickly unfriended her from their Facebook friends list to remove any trace of their connection. Unknown to them, there was a hidden CCTV camera in the hotel which recorded part of the event. According to the hotel receptionist's account (Ms. Ifeyinwa Njebu), the two checked in at the hotel at 8 a.m. on July 21, 2012. By the time they checked out, she had handed over to the second receptionist (Vivian Anuonye), who had taken over duty; so she asked her to check them out. They checked in again (with Cynthia) at the hotel at about 12 a.m. on July 21, 2012. When Ms. Njebu resumed the next day by July 22, Vivian handed over to her and gave her details about the room already occupied. The room that Ms Njebu checked in the couple was to expire on July 22, 12 noon. After the two left in the morning, his brother came to take over the room. So she noted that and she was also aware that the other person was still occupying the room. Mrs. Njebu routinely called all the rooms in the hotel to ascertain those who are still in and those about to check out. After sometime, she saw Nwabufor coming down the stairs. Ms. Njebu asked Nwabufor after calling his room to know if he was still staying. When Nwabufor reached down the stairs, he told her that he would be staying behind but that she should permit him to withdraw money from the ATM to pay for the day. When he told her his girlfriend (referring to Cynthia) was still upstairs, she did not go to check. He was not a regular guest at the hotel. He assured her that his girlfriend was there with the room key. Ms. Njebu told Mr. Nwabufor to return to the hotel before 12 noon, when the payment for their room would expire. He didn't submit the key to her. Olisaeloka came out from the bar and they both left the hotel. She never saw them again. At about 3 p.m. she received a phone call from one of them. The caller said that he was the occupant of the room who left recently and that he was not coming back and he instructed her to remove the \\"idiot\\" out of the room. She replied him politely to remind him that, he promised to come back and pay for the day. He said he was not coming back and dropped the call. Ms. Njebu informed the hotel's manager about the development and he assured her that since the caller's girlfriend was still in, she would pay for the room. So, the manager told her to call the room through the intercom. She called many times but no response. The manager went upstairs, knocked several times but didn't get any response. The hotel management directed her to use the master key to access the room, as a last resort. So she went upstairs, knocked again. After, no one responded, she used her master key to open the door. And from the door, she saw Cynthia's lifeless body lying naked on the bed. She was lying horizontal with her legs touching the ground. She screamed with shock and rushed downstairs to inform the manager, who alerted the police. From the CCTV footage played to her by the police, Ms. Njebu identified Messrs Nwabufo and Olisaeloka. She was able to recognize the duo when the police brought them to the Area E police station in Festac Town, Lagos. After the hotel found her body, since her ID cards and mobile phones had been stolen, they could not identify her immediately or call friends and family. Her body was deposited in a morgue in Lagos. ==Investigations== All this time, unaware of Cynthia's murder, her family and friends were praying for her safe return. Meanwhile, Cynthia's mother, Mrs. Osokogu, tried calling Cynthia's cell phone for five days but her phone was switched off. On the seventh day, she recalled that one of the men picked her call and told her that Cynthia was sick. Not too long afterwards, they implied that Cynthia had been kidnapped and asked her mother for 20 million Naira ransom. Cynthia's mum asked them if they killed her daughter and they said no, she was just sick and couldn't come to the phone. The phone call was traced to Festac. There, her missing person's police report was submitted to the Area E Command in Festac. This enabled her family to trace her body to the morgue and also led them to the hotel. The police in Lagos delayed the release Cynthia's body to her parents for burial because they had intended to carry out an autopsy on the body at the Ikeja General Hospital morgue. Police Commissioner Umaru Manko revealed that the pathologist was still working on the autopsy which was ongoing at the time she was identified. Eventually, her body was released for burial and she was laid to rest in her hometown. A ceremonial burial was performed at the family residence in Boji-Boji Owa, Ika North Local Government Area of Delta State after a requiem mass. The Governor of Delta State, Mr. Emmanuel Uduaghan condoled with the Osokogu family and called on the police to conclude investigation quickly and bring the culprits to book. After Cynthia's murder and investigations progressed through cell phone records and CCTV footages, the police arrested the suspects. Crime scene Cynthia's body was found naked with her two hands tied behind her back with a brown tape and supported with a padlocked chain; her two legs were also taped together. Her mouth was stuffed with hair net and handkerchief, also tied with brown tape round her head to seal her mouth and secure the materials inside. There were pin-point holes in her white eyes as well as inside the upper part of her airways and surface of her lungs, a condition described as ‚Äòpetechial hemorrhage'. The pathologist also revealed that Cynthia had suffered pulmonary Oedema, an overweight of the lungs from being soaked by blood. Her left and right lungs weighed 400 and 500 grams respectively due to \\"blood accumulation‚Äù, noting that the normal weight would be 250 to 350 grams. The final autopsy stated that Cynthia was asphyxiated; suffocated to death through blockage of air into her lungs. Apart from her death resulting from asphyxia, the pathologist, John Oladapo Obafunwa also observed that she had multiple bruises and abrasions suspected to be from biting. Her autopsy further revealed that a dose of ‚ÄòRohypnol‚Äô sold to the suspects by a pharmacist, Osita Orji, was not responsible for Cynthia's death. After the arrest, several other women came forward to reveal that they had also been drugged, tied up and robbed by the suspects, but they all survived to tell the story. According to reports, these two young men also confessed that they had robbed several other women prior to Cynthia who happened to be their sixth victim. The gang reportedly specializes in luring unsuspecting young women, robbing them of their possessions before killing them. Although there were speculations that their motive was ritualistic, it appeared that it was greed and their main goal was to rob and kill. The specific reason Cynthia was killed was not fully established. The police proposed some theories; Perhaps, the suspects became enraged at the lack of payday after spending so much money to get her there. Or, probably, Cynthia struggled or attempted to scream even after being drugged with the sedative Rohypnol. \\"She was struggling to see how she could liberate herself or make noise in order to attract people to rescue her\\"; The investigating officer, FESTAC Area Commander, Dan Okoro said, \\"But they overpowered her.\\" The police also stated that it was very likely that the culprits targeted her as they believed she would be carrying large amounts of cash. She was targeted, because the suspects had figured out that she was the daughter of a retired Army general. They assumed that she would come to Lagos with big cash, a large bank account and jewellery. \\"At some point they discovered that she came from a very good home and felt that they could make some quick money out of her.\\" But her elder brother, Kenneth, stated that Cynthia never carried any large sums of cash and she never even had an ATM card, she used a checkbook. Several other men were arrested in connection with the crime including the pharmacist who sold the Rohypnol to the suspected killers without a prescription, their driver who always accompanied them during their robberies and a \\"fence\\"‚Äî the man who sold Cynthia's and the other victims goods. ==Trial== About one month after Cynthia was laid to rest, the trial commenced at Yaba Magistrate court, Lagos on August 27, 2012. Six people were arrested at the beginning of the investigation, they included: Olisaeloka Ezike, 23, and Okwuno Nwabufor, 33; both of whom were identified as the Facebook friends. Others were Osita Orji, the pharmacist who sold Rohypnol to them and Nonso Ezike, Olisaeloka's brother who assisted in selling the deceased's Blackberry phone. The six-count charge of conspiracy, murder, armed robbery, rape, ‚Äúunlawful administration of obnoxious substance‚Äù and ‚Äúforceful administration of obnoxious substance‚Äù with a view to causing bodily harm were read to them. The trial commenced with the prosecution, the Lagos State Government calling its first witness. Okwumo Nwabufo and Olisaeloka Ezike were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and felony. Orji Osita, a pharmacist, was charged with negligently selling the Rohypnol Flunitrazepan tablets to Ezike, the 2nd defendant, without a doctor's prescription and without showing due care. Nonso Ezike (Nwabufo's younger brother) was charged with being in possession of the three stolen blackberry mobile phones belonging to the late Cynthia Osokogu. All the accused initially pleaded not guilty to all six counts. Justice Olabisi Akinlade of the Lagos High Court sitting at Igbosere admitted as evidence, confessional statements of the culprits recorded in a video. When the first defendant was arrested, he confessed that he knew what he did and that everything was over. The first defendant then operated the Blackberry phone to reveal the chain used in tying his victim. The first defendant was arrested on August 20, 2012, after which he made the confessional statement. The Attorney General of Lagos State, Mr Ade Ipaye, prosecuted the murder suspects, revealing details of pictures from the crime scene in the court from a laptop. The witness added that he and his team followed the first defendant to his home in Festac and recovered the said laptop, along with some phones and various network SIM cards. On that same date, the first defendant was asked to open the laptop, which he carried by himself to the Area Commander's office. \\"Pictures of the deceased lying down and her international passport lying on her chest was revealed‚Äù, the witness said. Another prosecution‚Äôs witness testified that from his investigation, it was discovered that the fourth defendant (Nonso) received different stolen phones from the first and second defendants on three occasions. The fourth defendant stole somebody‚Äôs receipt in Ladipo Market which he used in selling the deceased‚Äôs phone to someone in Port Harcourt and the person was arrested. The witness also told the court of another investigation against the defendants, in two separate hotels- Chelsea Suit and Penny Hotel,Festac, where they were alleged to have carried out similar acts. The cases were separated because the incidents did not happen on the same day. It was based on the confessional statement by the first and second defendants that they carried out similar acts in other hotels in Festac. In one of his appearances in court, Nwabufo denied ever knowing about Rohypnol nor did he put it into Cynthia‚Äôs drink. He also claimed that Cynthia was his lover and that they were planning to get married before her death. Nwabufo said he met her at Shoprite Mall in Lekki in 2011 where he went for shopping, while she was also shopping at a fashion shop, dismissing the allegations that they met on Facebook. He also added that when he met her, she was making inquires so he introduced himself to her and she did the same, adding that they exchanged contacts afterwards. He also said that they developed friendship after exchanging addresses and became very close since then. However, there has been no sufficient evidence to warrant this claim. The judge also dismissed the claim by Mr. Nwabufor that Ms. Osokogu was his fianc√©e and was going to introduce him to her father, saying that the \\"lover's\\" story was false because under cross-examination Nwabufor could not tell Cynthia's birthday, the name of her mother, her home town or, in fact, anything about her. Though the convicts pleaded not guilty and tried to withdraw the confessional statements they made to the police claiming they were made under duress, the court admitted the statements they made were corroborated by the testimonies of the witnesses and the evidence provided by the police. The judge said the fact that the police produced a video footage of the convicts making the confessional statements also helped in countering the claim by the convicts that they made the statements under duress. The court was satisfied that the confessional statements were not given under duress and admitted them in evidence. A confession is sufficient to gain conviction, the judge said. The confessional statement of the accused is consistent with the state of the body and consistent to the medical evidence. The judge said she would act on it accordingly. While delivering the judgement, the judge said the accused deserved the sentence as they were not remorseful of their action, and were telling the court lies after offering confessional statements to the police. The judge also found the duo guilty on three other counts and sentenced them to a total of 20 years imprisonment each. They were sentenced to 14 years in jail for conspiracy to commit murder, three years for conspiracy to commit felony by stealing, and three years for stealing a Blackberry phone. The judge acquitted and discharged Osita and Nonso. While delivering the judgement, Mrs. Akinlade said she relied on the evidence and testimonies provided by the prosecution. She said, having carefully analysed the evidence and testimonies before the court, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that Messrs. Nwabufor and Ezike murdered Ms. Osokogu. The judge stated that the evidence of the prosecution remained uncontroverted and relies mainly on the testimonies of witnesses and evidence. It was also very clear that the first defendant was untruthful and deceived the court. In sentencing both men to death by hanging, the judge said it was no longer relevant to know who, between the two, actually killed Ms. Osokogu. The second defendant acted in consent with the first defendant and will bear the consequences of their action irrespective of whoever committed the offence. The Judge held that with its 10 witnesses and 17 exhibits, the prosecution's case against Nwabufo and Ezike was uncontroverted and that the circumstantial evidence brought by the state was ‚Äúcogent, complete, unequivocal and compelling.‚Äù The judge held that the circumstantial evidence brought by the state in proof of the six counts of conspiracy, murder and stealing against the accused persons were cogent, complete, unequivocal and compelling. Counsel for Orji and Nonso had requested bail for their clients and Justice Akinlade had granted bail to Orji with two sureties. The court granted bail to Orji Osita and Ezike Nonso, while the other two who allegedly committed the offence of murder were remanded at the Kirikiri prison, Lagos. For Nonso, Olisaeloka's younger brother, the judge granted him bail with two sureties, adding that one of the sureties must be a civil servant not less than Grade Level 14 while the other must be a property owner with a genuine Certificate of Occupancy. On March 23, 2017, the Lagos state high court, Igbosere, sentenced Nwabufo and Ezike to death by hanging. ==Aftermath== Cynthia's murder exposed the dark side of the internet in a way that most people could not imagine. Her mother advised youths to be very cautious of making friends with people that they did not know. She stated ‚ÄúThe youths should be very careful, especially when they are making friends in social media. Like we have seen in the case of my daughter, such friends may have ulterior motives.\\" The police said the incident was a wakeup call to parents to become more vigilant about what their children are involved with while surfing the web. Stricter regulations were proposed for the Federal Government to enforce and restrict the sale of the sedative drug Rohypnol over the counter without the doctor's prescription in Nigeria. The judge's final verdict lifted the hopes of some who had lost interest in the case.

Located on and around Hubbard, Williams, and Willieb Streets, the area includes a mid-19th century frame factory as well as later brick buildings, and houses belonging to its owners, members of the Williams family. The soap factory operated by the Williamses was one of the otherwise agrarian town's largest economic forces until its mid-20th century decline. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==Description and history== James B. Williams, a native of Lebanon, Connecticut, came to Manchester in 1834, where he began experimenting with soap formulations while working at a general store. In 1840 he established a small shop for soap production there, which met with success. In 1849 he moved to Glastonbury, where he acquired the site of a former gristmill owned by his first father-in- law, Jerusha Hubbard. The industrial complex on the south side of Williams Street is where this business developed, eventually growing to include buildings on the north side of the street. The business peaked in the 1920s, employing about 300 workers, and was Glastonbury's largest single employer. It was sold out of the family in 1957, with the facilities used by their successors until 1977. The surviving factory buildings (which include four brick buildings and a rare wood-frame building from the mid-19th century), have been converted into residences. In 1859 J.B. Williams built an elaborate brick Italianate mansion on Willieb Street, set on a hill overlooking the factory. His son David built a Queen Anne/Shingle style house in 1892 on Williams Street, and another son, Samuel, built a fine Georgian mansion on Hubbard Street. The oldest building in the district is a much-altered c. 1740 house known informally as \\"Grandfather's House\\", as it was where Jerusha Hubbard lived at the time of the Williams purchase. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Greek Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Victorian architecture in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Glastonbury, Connecticut ","title":"J.

Pottier's long stay in East Asia and the Pacific finally came to an end in 1874, when he became second-in-command of the screw aviso in the South Atlantic Division. He took part in a hydrographic survey in Patagonia from 1875 to 1876. From 1877 to 1881, he served aboard ships of the Antilles Division, first as second-in-command of the steam frigate from 1877 to 1878, then as second-in command of the cruiser . Promoted to capitaine de fr√©gate on 12 July 1881, Pottier became second-in-command of the steam frigate , which was serving as a training ship for midshipmen. In August 1882, he reported aboard the ironclad battleship as her second-in-command. In November 1882, he transferred to the new ironclad battleship ‚Äì which was commissioned that month and was assigned to the Reserve Squadron ‚Äì as her commanding officer. He became commanding officer of the aviso in the Antilles Division in January 1884 and was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour on 18 November 1884. Pottier received a promotion to capitaine de vaisseau on 8 February 1886 and took command of the battleship in the Levant Division in April 1887.

From 1890 to 1891, he was commanding officer of the ironclad battleship in the Mediterranean and the Levant. In April 1892, he became the naval adjutant in Rochefort. Promoted to rear admiral on 10 February 1893, Pottier became 4th Maritime District commander at Rochefort on 7 October 1893. He assumed command of a division of the Mediterranean Squadron in 1896. In 1897, he took command of the French division of the International Squadron, a multinational force that intervened in a Christian uprising against the Ottoman Empire on Crete, operating on and around Crete from February 1897 to December 1898 and managing the island's affairs via an Admirals Council consisting of the admirals commanding the national contingents of the squadron, which included Pottier. In 1898 he relieved Italian Vice Admiral Felice Napoleone Canevaro as commander of the International Squadron and president of the Admirals Council, remaining the squadron's senior officer and president of the council until the squadron's dissolution,Clowes, p. 444. and he was elevated to the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour on 12 July 1898 and promoted to vice admiral on 11 October 1898. In the International Squadron's final act, Pottier steamed aboard his flagship, the protected cruiser ‚Äì accompanied by the squadron's Italian flagship, the battleship , its Russian flagship, the armored cruiser with the senior Russian commander Rear Admiral Nicholas Skrydloff aboard, and its British flagship, the battleship with Rear-Admiral Gerard Noel aboard ‚Äì on 19 December 1898 to Milos in the Aegean Sea, where Prince George of Greece and Denmark left his yacht on 20 December and embarked aboard Bugeaud. Escorted by the other three flagships, Bugeaud took him to Suda, Crete, where Prince George disembarked on 21 December 1898 to take up duties as High Commissioner of the new Cretan State under the suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan. His arrival on the island brought 229 years of direct Ottoman rule of Crete to an end.Clowes, p. 448. Pottier and the other admirals commanding the national contingents of the International Squadron promptly requested that their governments recall them, and the International Squadron was dissolved. On 27 March 1899, Pottier became Maritime Prefect of the 4th Maritime District in Rochefort. On 1 August 1900, he became commander-in-chief of the Far East Squadron, with the ironclad battleship as his flagship.

It was described by Henry Walter Bates in 1864 and is found in Mexico, Central America and south to Peru. It has been recorded as a vagrant in the United States in southern Florida, Arizona and Texas. ==Description== Adults have wings mottled in grey, brown and white. They are very similar in appearance to the grey cracker (Hamadryas februa) and like them have small, submarginal eyespots on the underside of the hindwings that incorporate some orange scales; these are the only two members of the genus to have orange eyespot scales. The pale cracker differs from the grey cracker in lacking a small red bar on the forewing. ==Distribution and habitat== The pale cracker is native to Mexico, Central America and South America as far south as Guatemala and Peru. It has been recorded as a vagrant in the United States, in southeastern Arizona (rare stray), south Texas (one sighting) and Florida. It is found in open areas with scattered trees, both moist areas and semi-arid ones. ==Ecology== Adults do not visit flowers, instead feeding on rotting fruit, carrion, and mud. Adults are in the habit of resting on tree trunks where their mottled appearance makes them inconspicuous. On the approach of another butterfly, a male will take to the air, emitting a cracking sound; if the approaching butterfly is a male, it will respond with a crack while a female will remain silent, and this enables the male to select a partner of the opposite sex. In the evening, the butterflies congregate on the trunk of one tree before flying into nearby trees and bushes to roost separately. The eggs are laid on the leaves of vines in the family Euphorbiaceae, the host plant in Guatemala being Dalechampia scandens. ==Subspecies== *H. glauconome glauconome (Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico) *H. glauconome grisea Jenkins, 1983 (Mexico) ==References== Category:Hamadryas (butterfly) Category:Butterflies of North America Category:Butterflies of Central America Category:Nymphalidae of South America Category:Butterflies described in 1864 Category:Taxa named by Henry Walter Bates ","title":"Hamadryas glauconome"},{"id":"56127158","text":"Louis Gregory (born July 1978), also known as Uncle Louie, is an American actor, music producer, and talent manager.

Her zine, Doris, played a central role in the 1990s girl zine movement associated with third wave feminism. Doris drew attention for its frank, personal exploration of topics, such as sexual assault, consent, abortion, addiction, queer identity, death of family members, among other topics. Crabb continues to publish and self-publish while also running an on- line zine distro that highlights feminist and personal zines by various authors. == Early life == Crabb was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She described her early home life as a difficult one, in which she experienced abuse and financial hardship. She first attended an alternative school, which she liked, but she later moved to a public school in the sixth grade, which was \\"...a huge, terrible change.\\" When she was seventeen years old, Crabb enrolled in a Women's Studies class. During this time, \\"...I started retreating from society and dealing with some abuse stuff.\\" Some of her friends participated in heated protests against United States intervention in Central America. She did not attend the protests, but the brutal experiences of her friends left an impression on her. She then moved to Plainfield, Vermont, where she worked at the Institute for Social Ecology and lived for three years. During this period, she began to explore anarchism in her personal studies. Following her time in Vermont, Crabb moved Portland, Oregon. She joined the local chapter of Food Not Bombs, after seeing a listing in the local paper that stated some people were interested in starting a local chapter. She lived in a communal house during this period. However, she left the communal house after a falling out. == Doris zine == In 1993, Crabb moved Berkeley, California, and she explains in interviews that she began her zine in this period. She was inspired by Miranda July and Johanna Fateman‚Äôs zine Snarla. She was particularly interested in secrets, and her zine had a journal-like, confessional quality. As she explained in an interview, > \\"When I started Doris, I was obsessed with secrets. I felt like everything > was secret inside of me pretty much. I definitely had concrete secrets about > abuse, about family, and about abusive situations I put myself in, and also > feeling crazy. I was very afraid of going crazy. I also had secrets about > how beautiful I thought things were. A lot of my friends were very tough and > thought everything was disgusting capitalism. And I thought, 'But look at > all this beautiful stuff just laying around in hidden places,' and that was > secret too. The main reason I started writing zines was because I was > obsessed with how alienated people were. Why did we just talk about music > and tattoos, or Foucault? I wanted to break the barriers of what you could > talk about. In the beginning I wanted to learn to write about political > stuff. And then I stopped caring as much about that.\\" Crabb became close friends with the Cometbus zine editor, Aaron Elliott, and was later to form the bands Astrid Oto and The Blank Fight with Elliott. Her diaries, papers, and website are archived at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard‚Äôs Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. == Bibliography ==  Books and articles  * \\"How Jane Helped 11,000 Women Get Abortions When the Procedure Was Outlawed.\\" Teen Vogue (2017). * Learning Good Consent: On Healthy Relationships and Survivor Support, (editor) AK Press (2016). * \\"Feminism‚Ä¶Anarchism‚Ä¶Anarchafeminism\\" (comic) in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory No. 29 IAS Press (2016). * \\"Healthy Relationships\\" (essay) in Stay Solid!

Huntsman School of Business (Utah State University) and author of three books on marketing. == Biography ==  Early life  Eric Schulz was born in 1957. In his youth he played baseball and basketball, and while studying at Orem High School in 1974 he participated in setting the world record for basketball marathon, a 45-hour game which record was published in the 1974 Guinness Book of Records. After graduating from Orem High School in 1976 Schulz went to study political science at Brigham Young University in Provo where he received his BA degree in 1981.  Business career  After college he went to work a marketing intern for the Utah Jazz working in their Salt Lake City and Las Vegas offices. In October 1982, he became the marketing director of the Salt Lake City Gulls, minor league baseball club, and in 1983 was named General Manager of the Redwood Pioneers, a minor league baseball team in the California League, an affiliate of California Angels. There he hired Ken Korach sports commentator into his first baseball play-by-play job, secured radio broadcast agreement with KSRO radio in Santa Rosa, CA and arranged several events to increase game attendance including firework displays, music concerts and giveaways. In 1985 Schulz returned to his alma mater Brigham Young University to complete his MBA at the Marriott School of Business (1987). In June 1987 Schulz started his career at Procter & Gamble in the Food & Beverage Division and within 5 years advanced from brand assistant for Citrus Hill juice brand team to Hawaiian Punch brand manager. He joined P&G;'s \\"Invention Team\\" lead by Doug Hall and launched new products for Folgers Coffee, Duncan Hines and Hawaiian Punch. Working together they developed a Rapid Test that reduced new product concept testing time significantly, reporting results from 5 cities in 7 days. Schulz was also part of the team working on Citrus Hill package redesign that resulted in adding pouring spout to the carton (that later became a standard for packaged juices). From 1992 to 1994 Schulz worked as senior brand manager at Buena Vista Home Entertainment. He was responsible for the home video marketing and helped develop Disney‚Äôs first direct-to-video release The Return of Jafar (1994). In July 1994, he joined The Coca-Cola Company as Director of Worldwide Olympic Marketing and managed various Olympic events during the 1996 Summer Olympics including Olympic Torch Relay, Coca-Cola Olympic City theme park in Atlanta as well as Olympic advertising. He became Vice President of Marketing for Feld Entertainment. In January 1997, Schulz moved to Special Olympics International and in November 1999 became Vice President of Event Marketing for the initial launch of the XFL Football League. In 1999, he published his first book on marketing The Marketing Game: How the World's Best Companies Play to Win. In May 2005, he rejoined the Utah Jazz as Vice President of Marketing, where he launched several new initiatives including an integrated social media portal, NBA‚Äôs first fan-based blogger network, the ‚ÄúUtah Jazzbots\\", variable ticket pricing, a contest to find a new team theme song, interactive TV test and a fan club called ‚ÄúJazz Rowdies‚Äù. Career in education In July, 2011, Schulz began teaching at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University as a senior lecturer and director. In 2011, he developed the first mass-student texting service at the University. He transitioned to full-time faculty in 2013, and began advising the Huntsman Marketing Association, a student club which holds case competitions each semester, and performs community service. In 2017, a team of students he coached won first place in the national Wake Forest Marketing Analytics Case Competition. In 2017, Schulz was named Undergraduate Faculty Mentor at the school, and in 2019 was named Teacher of the Year in the Marketing & Strategy Department. == Books == * * * == References == Category:Living people Category:Marketing theorists Category:Utah State University faculty Category:Marriott School of Management alumni Category:Utah Jazz executives Category:Procter & Gamble people Category:American male writers Category:Marketing people Category:1957 births Category:Brigham Young University alumni Category:Coca-Cola people Category:Branding theorists ","title":"Eric Schulz (professor)"},{"id":"56127292","text":"Bibimys labiosus), also known as the large-lipped crimson-nosed rat is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae.

Since the mid-2010s, many analysts have argued that such a global arms race for better military AI has already begun. == Terminology == More broadly, any competition for superior AI is sometimes framed as an \\"arms race\\". A quest for military AI dominance overlaps with a quest for dominance in other sectors, especially as a country pursues both economic and military advantage. == Risks == Nick Bostrom and others argue an AI risk could cause powers to skimp on safety precautions. Stephen Cave of the Leverhulme Centre argues the risk is threefold, with the first risk potentially having geopolitical implications, and the second two definitely having geopolitical implications: Cave argues the risk is compounded in the case of a race to artificial general intelligence, which may present an existential risk. Arms- race terminology is also sometimes used in the context of competition for economic dominance and \\"soft power\\"; for example, the November 2019 'Interim Report' of the United States' National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, while stressing the role of diplomacy in engaging with China and Russia, adopts the language of a competitive arms race. It states that US military-technological superiority is vital to the existing world order:11 and stresses the ongoing US militarization of AI, together with militarization of AI by China and Russia, is for geopolitical purposes::1-2 In Foreign Policy, Paul Scharre warns that rhetoric about an AI arms race could, itself, amplify into a self-fulfilling prophecy. == Stances toward military artificial intelligence ==  Russia  Putin (seated, center) at National Knowledge Day, 2017 Russian General Viktor Bondarev, commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, stated that as early as February 2017, Russia was working on AI- guided missiles that could decide to switch targets mid-flight. Russia‚Äôs Military Industrial Committee has approved plans to derive 30 percent of Russia‚Äôs combat power from remote controlled and AI-enabled robotic platforms by 2030. Reports by state-sponsored Russian media on potential military uses of AI increased in mid-2017. In May 2017, the CEO of Russia's Kronstadt Group, a defense contractor, stated that \\"there already exist completely autonomous AI operation systems that provide the means for UAV clusters, when they fulfill missions autonomously, sharing tasks between them, and interact\\", and that it is inevitable that \\"swarms of drones\\" will one day fly over combat zones. Russia has been testing several autonomous and semi-autonomous combat systems, such as Kalashnikov's \\"neural net\\" combat module, with a machine gun, a camera, and an AI that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without human intervention. In September 2017, during a National Knowledge Day address to over a million students in 16,000 Russian schools, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated \\"Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind... Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world\\". Putin also said it would be better to prevent any single actor achieving a monopoly, but that if Russia became the leader in AI, they would share their \\"technology with the rest of the world, like we are doing now with atomic and nuclear technology\\". Russia is establishing a number of organizations devoted to the development of military AI. In March 2018, the Russian government released a 10-point AI agenda, which calls for the establishment of an AI and Big Data consortium, a Fund for Analytical Algorithms and Programs, a state-backed AI training and education program, a dedicated AI lab, and a National Center for Artificial Intelligence, among other initiatives. In addition, Russia recently created a defense research organization, roughly equivalent to DARPA, dedicated to autonomy and robotics called the Foundation for Advanced Studies, and initiated an annual conference on ‚ÄúRobotization of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.‚Äù The Russian military has been researching a number of AI applications, with a heavy emphasis on semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. In an official statement on November 1, 2017, Viktor Bondarev, chairman of the Federation Council‚Äôs Defense and Security Committee, stated that ‚Äúartificial intelligence will be able to replace a soldier on the battlefield and a pilot in an aircraft cockpit‚Äù and later noted that ‚Äúthe day is nearing when vehicles will get artificial intelligence.‚Äù Bondarev made these remarks in close proximity to the successful test of Nerehta, an uninhabited Russian ground vehicle that reportedly ‚Äúoutperformed existing [inhabited] combat vehicles.‚Äù Russia plans to use Nerehta as a research and development platform for AI and may one day deploy the system in combat, intelligence gathering, or logistics roles. Russia has also reportedly built a combat module for uninhabited ground vehicles that is capable of autonomous target identification‚Äîand, potentially, target engagement‚Äîand plans to develop a suite of AI-enabled autonomous systems. In addition, the Russian military plans to incorporate AI into uninhabited aerial, naval, and undersea vehicles and is currently developing swarming capabilities. It is also exploring innovative uses of AI for remote sensing and electronic warfare, including adaptive frequency hopping, waveforms, and countermeasures. Russia has also made extensive use of AI technologies for domestic propaganda and surveillance, as well as for information operations directed against the United States and U.S. allies. The Russian government has strongly rejected any ban on lethal autonomous weapon systems, suggesting that such a ban could be ignored.  China  China is pursuing a strategic policy of 'military-civil fusion' on AI for global technological supremacy. According to a February 2019 report by Gregory C. Allen of the Center for a New American Security, China‚Äôs leadership ‚Äì including paramount leader Xi Jinping ‚Äì believes that being at the forefront in AI technology is critical to the future of global military and economic power competition. Chinese military officials have said that their goal is to incorporate commercial AI technology to \\"narrow the gap between the Chinese military and global advanced powers.\\" The close ties between Silicon Valley and China, and the open nature of the American research community, has made the West's most advanced AI technology easily available to China; in addition, Chinese industry has numerous home-grown AI accomplishments of its own, such as Baidu passing a notable Chinese-language speech recognition capability benchmark in 2015. As of 2017, Beijing's roadmap aims to create a $150 billion AI industry by 2030. Before 2013, Chinese defense procurement was mainly restricted to a few conglomerates; however, as of 2017, China often sources sensitive emerging technology such as drones and artificial intelligence from private start-up companies. One Chinese state has pledged to invest $5 billion in AI. Beijing has committed $2 billion to an AI development park. The Japan Times reported in 2018 that annual private Chinese investment in AI is under $7 billion per year. AI startups in China received nearly half of total global investment in AI startups in 2017; the Chinese filed for nearly five times as many AI patents as did Americans. China published a position paper in 2016 questioning the adequacy of existing international law to address the eventuality of fully autonomous weapons, becoming the first permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to broach the issue. In 2018, Xi called for greater international cooperation in basic AI research. Chinese officials have expressed concern that AI such as drones could lead to accidental war, especially in the absence of international norms. In 2019, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper lashed out at China for selling drones capable of taking life with no human oversight.  United States  The Sea Hunter, an autonomous US warship, 2016 In 2014, former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel posited the \\"Third Offset Strategy\\" that rapid advances in artificial intelligence will define the next generation of warfare. According to data science and analytics firm Govini, the U.S. Department of Defense increased investment in artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing from $5.6 billion in 2011 to $7.4 billion in 2016. However, the civilian NSF budget for AI saw no increase in 2017. Japan Times reported in 2018 that the United States private investment is around $70 billion per year. The November 2019 'Interim Report' of the United States' National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence confirmed that AI is critical to US technological military superiority. The U.S. has many military AI combat programs, such as the Sea Hunter autonomous warship, which is designed to operate for extended periods at sea without a single crew member, and to even guide itself in and out of port. From 2017, a temporary US Department of Defense directive requires a human operator to be kept in the loop when it comes to the taking of human life by autonomous weapons systems. On October 31, 2019, the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Board published the draft of a report recommending principles for the ethical use of artificial intelligence by the Department of Defense that would ensure a human operator would always be able to look into the 'black box' and understand the kill- chain process. However, a major concern is how the report will be implemented. Project Maven is a Pentagon project involving using machine learning and engineering talent to distinguish people and objects in drone videos, apparently giving the government real-time battlefield command and control, and the ability to track, tag and spy on targets without human involvement. Reportedly it stops short of acting as an AI weapons system capable of firing on self-designated targets. The project was established in a memo by the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense on 26 April 2017. Also known as the Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team, it is, according to Lt. Gen. of the United States Air Force Jack Shanahan in November 2017, a project \\"designed to be that pilot project, that pathfinder, that spark that kindles the flame front of artificial intelligence across the rest of the [Defense] Department\\". Its chief, U.S. Marine Corps Col. Drew Cukor, said: \\"People and computers will work symbiotically to increase the ability of weapon systems to detect objects.\\" At the second Defense One Tech Summit in July 2017, Cukor also said that the investment in a \\"deliberate workflow process\\" was funded by the Department [of Defense] through its \\"rapid acquisition authorities\\" for about \\"the next 36 months\\".  United Kingdom  In 2015, the UK government opposed a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, stating that \\"international humanitarian law already provides sufficient regulation for this area\\", but that all weapons employed by UK armed forces would be \\"under human oversight and control\\".  Israel  Israel's Harpy anti-radar \\"fire and forget\\" drone is designed to be launched by ground troops, and autonomously fly over an area to find and destroy radar that fits pre-determined criteria.  South Korea  The South Korean Super aEgis II machine gun, unveiled in 2010, sees use both in South Korea and in the Middle East. It can identify, track, and destroy a moving target at a range of 4 km. While the technology can theoretically operate without human intervention, in practice safeguards are installed to require manual input. A South Korean manufacturer states, \\"Our weapons don't sleep, like humans must. They can see in the dark, like humans can't. Our technology therefore plugs the gaps in human capability\\", and they want to \\"get to a place where our software can discern whether a target is friend, foe, civilian or military\\". == Trends == According to Siemens, worldwide military spending on robotics was US$5.1 billion in 2010 and US$7.5 billion in 2015. China became a top player in artificial intelligence research in the 2010s. According to the Financial Times, in 2016, for the first time, China published more AI papers than the entire European Union. When restricted to number of AI papers in the top 5% of cited papers, China overtook the United States in 2016 but lagged behind the European Union. 23% of the researchers presenting at the 2017 American Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) conference were Chinese. Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Alphabet, has predicted China will be the leading country in AI by 2025. {  +  left;\\"  AAAI presenters: - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Country !! scope=\\"col\\"  in 2012 !! scope=\\"col\\"  in 2017 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  US  41%  34% - ! scope=\\"row\\"  China  10%  23% - ! scope=\\"row\\"  UK  5%  5% } == Proposals for international regulation == The international regulation of autonomous weapons is an emerging issue for international law. AI arms control will likely require the institutionalization of new international norms embodied in effective technical specifications combined with active monitoring and informal diplomacy by communities of experts, together with a legal and political verification process. As early as 2007, scholars such as AI professor Noel Sharkey have warned of \\"an emerging arms race among the hi-tech nations to develop autonomous submarines, fighter jets, battleships and tanks that can find their own targets and apply violent force without the involvement of meaningful human decisions\\". In 2014, AI specialist Steve Omohundro warned that \\"An autonomous weapons arms race is already taking place\\". Miles Brundage of the University of Oxford has argued an AI arms race might be somewhat mitigated through diplomacy: \\"We saw in the various historical arms races that collaboration and dialog can pay dividends\\". Over a hundred experts signed an open letter in 2017 calling on the UN to address the issue of lethal autonomous weapons; however, at a November 2017 session of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), diplomats could not agree even on how to define such weapons. The Indian ambassador and chair of the CCW stated that agreement on rules remained a distant prospect. As of 2017, twenty-two countries have called for a full ban on lethal autonomous weapons. Many experts believe attempts to completely ban killer robots are likely to fail. A 2017 report from Harvard's Belfer Center predicts that AI has the potential to be as transformative as nuclear weapons.Allen, Greg, and Taniel Chan. \\"Artificial Intelligence and National Security.\\" Report. Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University. Boston, MA (2017). The report further argues that \\"Preventing expanded military use of AI is likely impossible\\" and that \\"the more modest goal of safe and effective technology management must be pursued\\", such as banning the attaching of an AI dead man's switch to a nuclear arsenal. Part of the impracticality is that detecting treaty violations would be extremely difficult.Antebi, Liran. \\"Who Will Stop the Robots?.\\" Military and Strategic Affairs 5.2 (2013).Shulman, C., & Armstrong, S. (2009, July). Arms control and intelligence explosions. In 7th European Conference on Computing and Philosophy (ECAP), Bellaterra, Spain, July (pp. 2-4). == Other reactions to autonomous weapons == A 2015 open letter calling for the ban of lethal automated weapons systems has been signed by tens of thousands of citizens, including scholars such as physicist Stephen Hawking, Tesla magnate Elon Musk, and Apple's Steve Wozniak. Professor Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield has warned that autonomous weapons will inevitably fall into the hands of terrorist groups such as the Islamic State. == Disassociation == Many Western tech companies are leery of being associated too closely with the U.S. military, for fear of losing access to China's market. Furthermore, some researchers, such as DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, are ideologically opposed to contributing to military work. For example, in June 2018, company sources at Google said that top executive Diane Greene told staff that the company would not follow-up Project Maven after the current contract expired in March 2019. ==See also== * Arms race * Artificial intelligence * Artificial general intelligence * Ethics of artificial intelligence * Existential risk from artificial general intelligence * Global issue * Lethal autonomous weapon * Military robot * Unmanned combat aerial vehicle ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Paul Scharre, \\"Killer Apps: The Real Dangers of an AI Arms Race\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 98, no. 3 (May/June 2019), pp. 135‚Äì44. \\"Today's AI technologies are powerful but unreliable.

Her debut album which was also entitled Don't Touch Me (1965) and reached number three on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. It was Burgess's next single release \\"Misty Blue\\" that would become her biggest success and signature song. It reached the top five of the country songs chart in 1966 and would later be covered by Eddy Arnold and Dorothy Moore respectively. Her second studio album Wilma Burgess Sings Misty Blue (1966) would also peak in the top ten of the country albums chart. Burgess had her final top-twenty hit in 1967 with \\"Tear Time\\", but continued releasing albums with Decca Records until 1969. A close of friend of Jim Reeves's wife, Burgess would sign a recording contract with Reeves's Shannon label in the early 1970s. Her duet with Buddy Logan entitled \\"Wake Me Into Love\\" (1974) would reach the top twenty of the Billboard country chart. In 1977, she released two singles with RCA Records. She released her final studio album in 1982 with Could I Have This Dance and retired shortly afterward. == Albums ==  Studio albums  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions and other relevant details ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3.5em;font-size:90%;\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Don't Touch Me  * Released: May 1966 * Label: Decca Records * Format: Vinyl  3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Wilma Burgess Sings Misty Blue  * Released: February 1967 * Label: Decca * Format: Vinyl  5 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tear Time  * Released: November 1967 * Label: Decca * Format: Vinyl  36 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  The Tender Lovin' Country Sound of Wilma Burgess  * Released: June 1968 * Label: Decca * Format: Vinyl  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Parting Is Such Sweet Sorrow  * Released: June 1969 * Label: Decca * Format: Vinyl  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Wake Me Into Love  * Released: January 1974 * Label: Shannon * Format: Vinyl  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Could I Have This Dance  * Released: 1982 * Label: 51-West * Format: Vinyl  ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. }  Compilation albums  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of albums, showing relevant ideals ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Misty Blue  * Released: 1973 * Label: MCA Coral * Format: Vinyl - } == Singles == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of singles, with selected chart positions and showing other relevant details ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3.5em;font-size:90%;\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Confused\\"  1962  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Raining in My Pillow\\"  1964  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"You Can't Stop My Heart from Breaking\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1965  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"4\\" Don't Touch Me - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"The Closest Thing to Love\\"  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Baby\\"  7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Don't Touch Me\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1966  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Misty Blue\\"  4  rowspan=\\"2\\" Wilma Burgess Sings Misty Blue - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Fifteen Days\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1967  24 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Tear Time\\"  15  Tear Time - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Watch the Roses Grow\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1968  ‚Äî  The Tender Lovin' Country Sound of Wilma Burgess - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Look at the Laughter\\"  59  rowspan=\\"2\\" Parting Is Such Sweet Sorrow - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Parting (Is Such Sweet Sorrow)\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1969  68 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"The Woman in Your Life\\"  48  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"The Sun's Gotta Shine\\"  48  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Lonely for You\\"  1970  63  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Until My Dreams Come True\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1971  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"I See Her Love All Over You\\"  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Feelin' the Way a Woman Should\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1973  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"I'll Be Your Bridge (Just Lay Me Down)\\"  61  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Wake Me Into Love\\"  14  rowspan=\\"2\\" Wake Me Into Love - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"The Best Day of the Rest of Our Love\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1974  53 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Love Is Here\\"  46  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Love Is the Foundation\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1975  ‚Äî  Wake Me Into Love - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Baby's Not Forgotten\\"  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Satisfied Man\\"  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Use Me\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1977  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Once You Were Mine\\"  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Misty Blue\\"  1983  ‚Äî  -  colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } == Other charted songs == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" + List of songs, with selected chart positions and showing other relevant details ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Notes - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3.5em;font-size:90%;\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Sweet Lovin' Baby\\"  1975  86  - } ==Notes References == Category:Discographies of American artists ","title":"Wilma Burgess discography"},{"id":"56127432","text":"Communal Liberation Party New Forces (, TKP-YG) is a centre-left political party in Northern Cyprus. It is led by Mehmet √áakƒ±cƒ±. It was founded in 2016 after a group headed by √áakƒ±cƒ± broke off from the Communal Democracy Party (TDP). √áakƒ±cƒ± and former MP Mustafa Emiroƒülularƒ± resigned from the TDP on 25 November 2016. This was followed by the resignation of 70 other members of the TDP, mostly originating from the historical Communal Liberation Party (TKP), on 28 November 2016. The rationale given for these resignations was what they saw as \\"undemocratic\\" policies employed by the TDP leadership under Cemal √ñzyiƒüit and \\"the restriction of the freedom of speech within the party\\" after an election for the head of the G√ºzelyurt District. This had culminated in disciplinary action against Emiroƒülularƒ±, with the aim of expelling him from the party. √áakƒ±cƒ± and his fellows claimed that this was because Emiroƒülularƒ± wanted to change the name of the TDP back to \\"Communal Liberation Party\\" and also claimed that no new memberships had been allowed in the party for 6 months. √ñzyiƒüit had countered these by saying that \\"he was not concerned by personal business of this sort\\". √áakƒ±cƒ± founded the party using the name \\"Communal Liberation Party\\" (TKP) on 28 November 2016. In January 2017, Sonay Adem, Ali Gulle and ƒ∞brahim Korhan, a group of political figures from Gazimaƒüusa District, resigned from the Republican Turkish Party and joined the TKP. In the meanwhile, the High Administrative Court ruled that the establishment of a new party under the name \\"Communal Liberation Party\\" should be suspended. As a result of this and an agreement with the new members, the party changed its name to \\"Communal Liberation Party New Forces\\" on 19 January. On 13 March 2017, the Social Democratic Party merged into the TKP-YG. On 26 October 2017, it agreed with the United Cyprus Party to contest the election together under the TKP-YG list. This alliance was named the \\"Change and Liberation Alliance\\". The party's newspapers are Ortam, which used to be the TDP's newspaper but had √áakƒ±cƒ± as its majority shareholder, and Haberat√∂r. == References == Category:Political parties in Northern Cyprus Category:2016 establishments in Northern Cyprus Category:Political parties established in 2016 ","title":"Communal Liberation Party New Forces"},{"id":"56127463","text":"{ class=infobox style=\\"width:24em; text-align:center\\" - ded;\\"  22nd Dubai World Cup Meydan, 25 March 2017 -  - ded; font-size:110%;\\"  won by Arrogate (USA) } The 2017 Dubai World Cup was a horse race held at Meydan Racecourse on Saturday 25 March 2017. It was the 22nd running of the Dubai World Cup and the third running of the race since the synthetic Tapeta surface was replaced by a dirt track. The winner was Juddmonte Farm's Arrogate, a four-year-old grey colt trained in the United States by Bob Baffert and ridden by Mike Smith. Arrogate's victory was the third in the race for Baffert after Silver Charm in 1998 and Captain Steve in 2001 and was the first in the race for his jockey and owner. ==The contenders== The race had a strong North American challenge headed by Arrogate, who had begun his 2017 campaign by winning the Travers Stakes in record time. The other runners from the United States were Gun Runner, Keen Ice, Hoppertunity (Clark Handicap, Jockey Club Gold Cup) and Neolithic. The United Arab Emirates was represented by Mubtaahij (UAE Derby), Move Up (Bosphorus Cup), Special Fighter (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 3, 2016), Long River (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 3, 2017) and the Chilean-bred mare Furia Cruzada (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 2). The other four runners were the Japanese challengers Gold Dream (February Stakes), Awardee (JBC Classic), Apollo Kentucky (Tokyo Daishoten) and Lani (3rd in the Belmont Stakes). Betting is illegal in Dubai, but British bookmakers made Arrogate the 1/3 favourite ahead of Gun Runner on 7/1. The only other runners given any chance according to the betting were Hoppertunity, Move Up and Mubtaahij who started at 16/1. ==The race== Arrogate was hampered at the start and dropped back to the rear of the field. Long River set the early pace ahead of Gun Runner and Neolithic with Mubtaahij close behind. Few of the other runners were ever in contention. With half a mile left to run Gun Runner went to the front and Long River quickly dropped away. Gun Runner turned for home with a clear advantage but Arrogate produced a sustained run on the outside, took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by two and a quarter lengths. Neolithic was five lengths away in third ahead of Mubtaahi, Awardee, Hoppertunity and Keen Ice with the other seven finishers trailing in at long intervals. ==Race details== * Sponsor: Emirates Airline * Purse: ¬£8,130,081; First prize: ¬£4,878,048 * Surface: Dirt * Going: Muddy * Distance: 10 furlongs * Number of runners: 14 * Winner's time: 2:02.15 ==Full result== { class = \\"sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse;\\" - 7d7; text-align:center;\\" ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" Pos. ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" Marg. ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Horse (bred) ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" Age ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Jockey ! style=\\"width:210px;\\" Trainer (Country) ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Odds -  1   Arrogate (USA)  4  Mike Smith  Bob Baffert (USA)  1/3 fav -  2  2¬º  Gun Runner (USA)  4  Florent Geroux  Steve Asmussen (USA)  7/1 -  3  5  Neolithic (USA)  4  John Velazquez  Todd Pletcher (USA)  25/1 -  4  1¬æ  Mubtaahij (IRE)  6  Christophe Soumillon  Mike de Kock (UAE)  16/1 -  5  1¬Ω  Awardee (USA)  7  Yutaka Take  Mikio Matsunaga (JPN)  66/1 -  6  nk  Hoppertunity (USA)  6  Flavien Prat  Bob Baffert (USA)  16/1 -  7  1  Keen Ice (USA)  5  Javier Castellano  Todd Pletcher (USA)  33/1 -  8  4  Lani (USA)  4  Ryan Moore  Mikio Matsunaga (JPN)  100/1 -  9  5  Apollo Kentucky (USA)  5  Christophe Lemaire  Kenji Yamauchi (JPN)  66/1 -  10  2¬æ  Move Up (GB)  4  Adrie de Vries  Saeed bin Suroor (UAE)  50/1 -  11  8  Long River (USA)  7  Mickael Barzalona  Salem bin Ghadayer (UAE)  50/1 -  12  15  Special Fighter (IRE)  6  Fernando Jara  Maria Ritchie (UAE)  40/1 -  13  ¬Ω  Furia Cruzada (CHI)  5  Antonio Fresu  Erwan Charpy (UAE)  100/1 -  14  13¬Ω  Gold Dream (JPN)  4  Jo√£o Moreira  Osamu Hirata (JPN)  50/1 - } * Abbreviations: nse = nose; nk = neck; shd = head; hd = head ==Winner's details== Further details of the winner, Arrogate * Sex: Colt * Foaled: 11 April 2013 * Country: United States * Sire: Unbridled's Song; Dam: Bubbler (Distorted Humor) * Owner: Juddmonte Farms * Breeder: Clearsky Farms ==References== Category:Dubai World Cup Dubai World Cup Dubai World Cup Dubai World Cup ","title":"2017 Dubai World Cup"},{"id":"56127467","text":"The Wide Awake Grocery Building, located at 520 State St. in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, was completed in 1911.

It is endemic to the coastal areas of the Bahia state in eastern Brazil; it is known from the municipalities of Itacar√©, Ilh√©us, and Una. The specific name mucronatus is derived from Latin and means \\"pointed\\", referring to the pointed fingers tips of this frog. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is small but distinct, including a complete annulus. The canthus rostralis is indistinct. The fingers have no webbing nor discs, but they have pointed tips. The toes have no webbing but have pointed tips; toes III and IV bear discs. Skin is smooth with scattered small granules. The dorsal coloration varies from reddish brown (with or without dark brown spots) to homogeneous bluish gray. There may be irregular dark patches, inter-orbital lines, or a mid-dorsal Y-like pattern. The iris is reddish brown to yellowish brown. ==Behavior== When approached, adult frogs exhibit a mouth-gaping behavior: the frog keeps it mouth open for about 15 seconds. This is interpreted as a defensive behavior. A specimen was observed feeding on ants using its tongue; this is in agreement with stomach content observations in other Adelophryne. The male advertisement call consists of a single note lasting about 30 milliseconds. The dominant frequency is 5300 Hz. Calling males were observed from February to September, but greatest activity was from June onward. Females were found with few (2 or 3) but large eggs in their ovaries. ==Habitat and conservation== Adelophryne mucronatus occurs in shaded areas of primary and disturbed forests at elevations of above sea level. It lives under dense leaf litter. Males call between late afternoon and midnight from the ground beneath fallen, wet leaves, or from beneath leaves of terrestrial bromeliads. The species is known from three localities. While it also occurs in disturbed forests, it is more abundant and the breeding season is longer in pristine ones. It is threatened by deforestation. ==References== mucronatus Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 2012 ","title":"Adelophryne mucronatus"},{"id":"56127519","text":"Philophthalmidae is a family of trematodes in the order Plagiorchiida. ==Genera== *Cloacitrema Yamaguti, 1935Yamaguti, S.

Later that year Alabanza went on tour for their theatre show Stories of a Queer Brown Muddy Kid, performing at clubs, bookstores, and performance venues across the United Kingdom and abroad. They have been featured as a guest lecturer and panelist at over forty universities in the United Kingdom during LGBTQ and Black History month to discuss issues related to race, sexual orientation, and gender. Their work has been featured in Duckie, Bar Wotever, And What! Festival, Hamburg International Feminist Festival, Late at Tate, the V&A;, and Transmission Gallery. They are currently the youngest person to be awarded a residency at The Tate in 2017/2018. In 2016, Alabanza starred in the five star roundhouse production of Putting Words in Your Mouth by Scottee and became one of the 2016‚Äì2017 Artists in Residence at the Tate Britain. In 2017, they began working on a solo exhibition, The Other'd Artist for Transmission Gallery in Glasgow. Alabanza released their first chapbook titled Before I Step Outside. (You Love Me); a compilation of visual art, poetry, diary entries, and essays. They also performed the leading role in the stage adaptation of Derek Jarman's punk film Jubilee. Alabanza has critiqued mainstream feminism for having been rooted in transphobia and mainstream feminists for often neglecting trans and gender non-conforming people in their discussions of progress.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjvZ6TIXgAECw3u.jpg:large In 2018, Alabanza started a new show called Burgerz. This show focuses on audience participation regarding an incident in 2016 where a person threw a burger at them while walking across a bridge in London. The show ran its UK Tour from October 19 to November 17 in 2018. In 2019, Alabanza and Kaulbach, childhood friends, collaborated on an immersive installation titled All the Ways We Could Grow . The installation explores the question, 'What's it like to be trans?' while also provoking exploration into the calmness one experiences in their safe place, their bedroom. Disguised as a sleepover with pink satin sheets and pillows, the audience is encourage to take the space and imagine/reflect. The installation challenges the need for gender in society through works of imagery and poetry. == Personal life == Alabanza was born in Bristol and grew up on a council estate. They started making their art when they were 16 years old, helping them work through and process what adversities they were facing as a black, queer person. Alabanza began with their poems just as drafts on their phone, thinking they'd never show them to anyone else. After getting the burger thrown at them, they got fed up with keeping their feelings to themselves and presented their poems to their friend who was going through the same issues, which made Alabanza decide to make their works public. Alabanza identifies as black, trans feminine, gender non-conforming, and uses the pronouns they/them. Alabanza speaks out for trans rights and the importance of safe spaces and communities for gender non-conforming and transgender people. In November 2017, Alabanza was denied access to a female dressing room while shopping at Topshop in Manchester, the fashion retailer owned by Sir Philip Green. Alabanza was told to use the men's dressing room. They left the store and filed a complaint through social media. Alabanza accused Topshop of going against their policy to allow trans individuals to use the dressing rooms associated with their preferred gender. The Times published an opinion piece by Janice Turner, incorrectly implying that Topshop's policy was changed because of Alabanza's tweet and claiming the policy would lead to child abuse. Subsequently, Alabanza received online death threats over Topshop's policy. == Works == {  +List of Works !Work Title !Publisher !Date Published !Type of Work - The Sea OUTspoken April 2017 Poem - Queer and Now The Tate June 2017 Performance - Before I Step Outside.

The project aims to send organisms on board the spacecraft. ==Overview== Starlight aims to accelerate the spacecrafts with powerful lasers, a method the project refers to as DEEP-IN (Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration), thus allowing them to reach stars near the Solar System in a matter of years, in contrast to traditional propulsion methods which will require thousands of years. Each spacecraft will be the size of a DVD disc and will be powered by plutonium. They will fly at one-fifth of the speed of light, and in the case of Alpha Centauri, it will arrive after traveling more than twenty years from Earth. ==History== Starlight is a program of the Experimental Cosmology Group of University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and has received funding from NASA. In 2015, the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) selected DEEP-IN as a phase-1 project. ==Terrestrial biomes in space== Sent onboard Starlight, C. elegans may become the first terrestrial microbe to reach Alpha Centauri One goal of Starlight is to send terrestrial organisms along with the spacecraft, and observe how the interstellar environment and extreme acceleration affects them. This effort is known as Terrestrial Biomes in Space, and the lead candidate is Caenorhabditis elegans, a minuscule nematode. The organism will spend most of the voyage in a frozen state, and once the spacecraft approaches its target they will be thawed by heat from the onboard plutonium. Following their revival, the organisms will be monitored by various sensors, and the data they produce will be sent back to Earth. C. elegans have been used extensively in biological research as a model organism, owing to the fact that the worm is one of those having the fewest cells for an animal possessing a nervous system. A backup option for C. elegans are tardigrades, micro-animals that are known for their resilience to various conditions lethal to other animals, such as the vacuum environment of space and strong doses of ionizing radiation. Planetary protection NASA's funding does not cover the Terrestrial Biome in Space portion of Starlight, as the experiment may potentially contaminate exoplanets. ==See also== * Breakthrough Starshot, a similar initiative to Starlight * Interstellar probe * Interstellar travel * 2069 Alpha Centauri mission ==ReferencesExternal links== * Starlight official project site * DEEP IN Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration - NASA * Article about the project Category:Interstellar travel Category:Proposed space probes Category:Alpha Centauri Category:University of California, Santa Barbara ","title":"Starlight (interstellar probe)"},{"id":"56127681","text":"The following is a list of the television networks and announcers who have broadcast college football's Holiday Bowl throughout the years. ==Television== On June 15, 2017, it was revealed that the Holiday Bowl had not renewed its contract with ESPN‚Äîone of the network's longest relationships‚Äîand had entered into an agreement to move to FS1 beginning 2017. {  - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" !Date !Network !Play-by-play announcers !Color commentators !Sideline reporters - 2019 FS1 Gus Johnson Joel Klatt Jenny Taft - 2018 FS1 Gus Johnson Joel Klatt Jenny Taft - 2017 FS1 Gus Johnson Joel Klatt Jenny Taft - 2016 ESPN Bob Wischusen Brock Huard Allison Williams - 2015 ESPN Adam Amin Kelly Stouffer Olivia Harlan - 2014 ESPN Rece Davis Jesse Palmer and David Pollack Samantha Ponder - 2013 ESPN Joe Tessitore Matt Millen Maria Taylor - 2012 ESPN Dave Pasch Brian Griese Jenn Brown - 2011 ESPN Rece Davis Jesse Palmer Jenn Brown - 2010 ESPN Chris Fowler Todd Blackledge Erin Andrews - 2009 ESPN Chris Fowler Craig James and Jesse Palmer Erin Andrews - 2008 ESPN Chris Fowler Craig James and Jesse Palmer Erin Andrews - 2007 ESPN Brent Musburger Kirk Herbstreit Lisa Salters - 2006 ESPN Chris Fowler Kirk Herbstreit Erin Andrews - 2005 ESPN Keith Jackson Dan Fouts Holly Rowe and Todd Harris - 2004 ESPN Sean McDonough Craig James Heather Cox - 2003 ESPN Ron Franklin Mike Gottfried Adrian Karsten - 2002 ESPN Mike Tirico Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit Jerry Punch - 2001 ESPN Mike Tirico Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit  - 2000 ESPN Mike Tirico Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit  - 1999 ESPN Mike Tirico Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit  - 1998 ESPN Mike Tirico Todd Blackledge  - 1997 ESPN Rich Waltz Rod Gilmore  - 1996 ESPN Brad Nessler Gary Danielson  - 1995 ESPN Brad Nessler Gary Danielson  - 1994 ESPN Brad Nessler Gary Danielson Adrian Karsten - 1993 ESPN Brad Nessler Gary Danielson Sharlene Hawkes - 1992 ESPN Brad Nessler Gary Danielson Sharlene Hawkes - 1991 ESPN Steve Physioc Gary Danielson Jerry Punch - 1990 ESPN Sean McDonough Mike Gottfried Neil Lomax - 1989 ESPN Tim Brando Vince Dooley Jerry Punch - 1988 ESPN Bob Carpenter Kevin Kiley Sharlene Hawkes - 1987 ESPN Jim Kelly Kevin Kiley Sharlene Hawkes - 1986 ESPN Jay Randolph Dave Logan  - 1985 USA Network Lorimar Sports Network Eddie Doucette Tom Hammond Kyle Rote, Jr. Terry Donahue  Geoff Witcher - 1984 Mizlou Howard David Paul Maguire  - 1983 Mizlou Jim Simpson Bud Wilkinson  - 1982 Mizlou Fred White Irv Brown  - 1981 Mizlou Ray Scott   - 1980 Mizlou Ray Scott Grady Alderman  - 1979 Mizlou    - 1978 Mizlou    } ==Radio== {  - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" !Date !Network !Play-by-play announcers !Color commentators !Sideline reporters - 2019 KLSD Jon Schaeffer Rich Ohrnberger  - 2018 KLSD Jon Schaeffer Rich Ohrnberger  - 2017 Fox Sports on SiriusXM    - 2016 ESPN Radio Beth Mowins Anthony Becht Rocky Boiman - 2015 ESPN Radio Drew Goodman Tom Ramsey Marty Cesario - 2014 ESPN Radio Bill Rosinski David Norrie Joe Schad - 2013 ESPN Radio Bill Rosinski David Norrie Joe Schad - 2012 ESPN Radio Bill Rosinski David Norrie Joe Schad - 2011 ESPN Radio Bill Rosinski David Norrie Joe Schad - 2010 ESPN Radio Bill Rosinski David Norrie Joe Schad - 2009 ESPN Radio Bill Rosinski Dennis Franchione Joe Schad - 2006 ESPN Radio Dan Fouts Tim Brant Jack Arute } ==References== Holiday Broadcasters Holiday Bowl Holiday Bowl Holiday Bowl ","title":"List of Holiday Bowl broadcasters"},{"id":"56127690","text":"The Vaux Site is an area of brownfield land in the centre of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear currently undergoing development.

Jacques Offenbach (work list). In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. ==Performance history== The work, based on a com√©die-vaudeville (with music borrowed from existing stage works by popular contemporary composers) by the same authors, first staged in 1833, was premiered on 24 April 1847 at the Salle Moreau-Sainti in Paris. Offenbach had originally hoped for it to be adopted by the Op√©ra Comique, but the director Alexandre Basset appears not to have shown any interest in the work. The action takes place during the French Revolution in a country house in a village on the French border, where General Raymond, a recruiting sergeant, confronts a wily peasant, Sauvageot, who passes off Marielle as his wife. She is the daughter of the nurse of Comte Anatole d'Ambert, whom Raymond protects, while sending Sauvageot off to the army and marrying Marielle. The tenor Gustave Roger noted in his diary for Saturday 24 April 1847 that he went with Madame Talma to the salle Moreau- Sainti where he heard Goria play and Dorus sing, then \\"l‚ÄôAlc√¥ve, op√©ra-comique d‚ÄôOffenbach et de D√©forges\\" where he felt that despite some inexperience there were charming aspects. He went on to say that if the doors of the Op√©ra- Comique were not barred to him he would go far; \\"Offenbach est un gar√ßon qui ira tr√®s loin si on ne lui ferme pas les portes de l‚ÄôOp√©ra-Comique : il a une pers√©v√©rance du diable et de la m√©lodie\\".G. Roger. Carnet d‚Äôun t√©nor. Le Figaro ‚Äì Mardi 16 avril 1872. The full programme on the evening of its premiere, promoted by the composer himself, included a chorus by Offenbach and a cello concerto by him (where he played the solo part).Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. √âditions Gallimard, Paris, 2000, p.75-76. Despite a warm reception from the M√©nestrel reporter, the performance did not immediately open the doors of Parisian theatres to a lyrical work by Offenbach. Alexander Faris states in his study on Offenbach that a German version of l‚ÄôAlc√¥ve - Marielle, oder Sergeant und Commandant - was performed in Cologne on 9 January 1849 during the composer's stay there following the 1848 revolution.Faris, Alexander. Jacques Offenbach. Faber & Faber, London & Boston, 1980, p.35. According to Jean-Christophe Keck, the manuscript of L'Alc√¥ve has an earlier version of a solo for Lanternick in La Permission de dix heures, based on an air for Sauvageot.Le journal offenbachien de Jean-Christophe Keck, 26 May 2010, accessed 21 December 2017. ==Notes and references== Notes References Category:Operas by Jacques Offenbach Category:French-language operas Category:Operas Category:One-act operas Category:1847 operas ","title":"L'alc√¥ve"},{"id":"56127720","text":"\\"Night Wing\\" (stylized as \\"NIGHT WING\\") is a song recorded by Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo. It was released as a double A-side single alongside \\"Yukigasa\\" by Pony Canyon on November 5, 2008. It served as the ending theme to the AX music show Ongaku Senshi Music Fighter. ==Background and composition== \\"Night Wing\\" is Kudo's first single to be released as a double A-side, with \\"Yukigasa\\". Her 1998 single, \\"Kirara\\", and its coupling song, \\"In the Sky\\", received a similar treatment, but was never officially released as such. \\"Night Wing\\" was written and composed by Miyuki Nakajima, and arranged by Ichiz≈ç Seo. The song marks Kudo's first collaboration with Nakajima in two years, since \\"ClƒÅvis (Kagi)\\". It is described as a powerful midtempo song written by an invigorated Nakajima. Lyrically, the song describes a protagonist metaphorically \\"spreading her heart-shaped wings and soaring through a windy sky\\" and ambiguously pondering about her contradictory actions and mixed feelings. The song is composed in the key of A-sharp minor and Kudo's vocals span from G3 to A4. ==Cover version== Nakajima performed a cover of \\"Night Wing\\" in concert during her Enkai 2012-3 tour. In 2014, a live recording of one of her performances of the song was included on the live album, Miyuki Nakajima \\"Enkai\\" 2012-3: Live Selection. ==Chart performance== \\"Night Wing\\" debuted at number 75 on the Oricon Singles Chart, with 1,000 copies sold.

For her role as \\"Hadiza\\" in the film, Dima-Okojie was nominated for best supporting actress at the 2017 Nigeria Entertainment Awards. The story revolves around the relationship between two culturally different persons, and the challenges they faced in getting the approval of their parents in inter-tribal and multi- religious consummation of the marriage in a modern Nigerian society. == Plot == The film starts with Hadiza (Ini Dima-Okojie) and her father, Musa Ahmed (Gbenga Titiloye) performing the daily Salah, according to Islamic beliefs. Musa is a devout Muslim, who regularly attempts to indoctrinate his daughter into believing that only an Islamic Hausa man can make the best husband. Hadiza is more liberal in her view on marriage, and she frequently reads the biographical book, There was a Country, which was a narration on the events that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War written by Igbo author, Chinua Achebe. In a bid to ensure his family remain within the tribal and religious lines, Musa also match-makes Aliyu, an Islamic Northerner, to initiate a relationship with Hadiza, however she often felt no chemistry when he is around her. Emeka Okafor (OC Ukeje) is a Christian from Southeastern Nigeria. He works as a physiotherapist in an unnamed hospital. During one of Hadiza's field trip to a site, she lost a step and fell from the building. She got hospitalized and was admitted to the hospital Emeka works. Despite being repelled by his jokes on first site, they later began a relationship despite the ethnic differences. Musa is later revealed to be unknowingly dating Emeka's mother, Ifeoma (Carol King), both of which are widows after losing their spouse from the first marriages. A dinner night is fixed for the four couples to meet. On seeingthat his daughter is dating the son of his lover, Musa objected to the continuation of the relationship, explaining that it violated his religious beliefs and personal principles.

The Movie Pencil gave it an \\"A+\\", describing it as one of the smoothest Nigerian romantic films with an excellent continuity and stellar performances from the lead actors. == References == Category:Nigerian romantic drama films Category:Films shot in Lagos Category:English-language films Category:Hausa- language films Category:Interfaith romance films Category:Films about marriage ","title":"North East (2016 film)"},{"id":"56128176","text":"This is a list of Wikipedia articles about brand names under which electric guitars have been sold. ==A== * Alembic * Tom Anderson * Aria ==C== * Caparison * Carvin * Chapman * Charvel * Cort ==D== * Danelectro * D'Angelico * Dean * Duesenberg ==E== * Eko * Epiphone * ESP ==F== * Fender * Fender Japan * Fernandes * First Act * Framus ==G== * G&L; * Gibson * Godin * Greco * Gretsch ==H== * Harmony * H√∂fner * Hagstr√∂m ==I== * Ibanez ==J== * Jackson ==K== * Kay * Kiesel Custom Guitars * Kramer ==M== * Mayones * Mosrite ==O== * Ormsby ==P== * Parker * PRS ==R== * B.C.

Born in Whately, Massachusetts on September 17, 1822 to Chester and Phila (n√©e Jewett) Crafts,Craft, 301. he arrived in Holyoke at age 11, and after attending school began his first business driving a stagecoach between Springfield and Northampton carrying mail and passengers. At the age of 20 he helped his brother, Chester, open a general store under the name Chester Crafts & Co. In 1843 he married Ms. Delia Jones of Ireland Parish; the couple bore one son, Pliny Jones Chester on February 9, 1845. This same year he left his brother's venture to open his own store on High Street. By 1866 he had made his son a business partner, operating under the name R.P. Crafts & Son. In 1870 his store's building and its contents burned to the ground, prompting him to construct the Caledonia Building in 1874. Prior to this he had served as the city's fire chief from 1868 to 1869, and following his own store's fire served for one more year in 1871. The R.P. Crafts house, Ever present in the political landscape of the town, he ran successfully for a representative seat for the Massachusetts Legislature in 1872.

Deakin (1939‚Äì2014) was an Australian mathematician and mathematics educator. He was known for his work as a writer and editor of Function, a mathematics magazine aimed at high school students, and as a biographer of ancient Greek mathematician Hypatia. He won the B. H. Neumann award of the Australian Mathematics Trust in 2003 for his \\"rich and varied commitment to mathematics enrichment\\". ==Education and career== Deakin was born in August 1939. He grew up in Tasmania, and moved to Melbourne late in his high school education, taking a second matriculation year studying Latin at St Patrick's College, East Melbourne before entering the University of Melbourne in 1957. He completed a bachelor's degree with second-class honours in mathematics at Melbourne in 1961. He went on to earn a master's degree there in 1963, with a thesis on integral equations supervised by Russell Love. Deakin moved to the University of Chicago in 1963 for graduate study, and completed his Ph.D. in 1966. He became a lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne in 1967, but then in 1970 moved to Papua New Guinea to become reader-in-charge in the mathematics department of the Institute of Higher Technical Education. He returned to Monash as a senior reader in 1973. He earned a master's degree in education in 1975 from the University of Exeter, and remained at Monash for the rest of his career. He died on August 5, 2014. ==Function== In 1976 a group of mathematicians at Monash University led by department chair Gordon Preston recognized the need for a journal focused \\"mathematics as mathematicians themselves would recognise it, but addressed to secondary students\\". A secondary but explicit goal was to encourage young women in mathematics, as at that time their under-representation was already recognized. Later, over beers with friends from other disciplines, Deakin found the name for the new journal, Function. The journal was published from 1977 to 2004, and Deakin became a founding member of its editorial board, its most frequent contributor, and, for much of its existence, its editor-in- chief. ==Hypatia== Deakin published the first of his several articles on Hypatia in 1992 in Function. In 2007, he published the book Hypatia of Alexandria: Mathematician and Martyr (Prometheus Books). Aimed at a popular audience, the book is \\"at least in part, a response to Maria Dzielska's Hypatia of Alexandria\\", which had focused on the historical and literary legacy of Hypatia at the expense of her mathematics, and which Deakin had previously reviewed for the American Mathematical Monthly. In his book, Deakin organizes the work of other scholars on Hypatia's mathematics, particularly relying on the earlier work of Wilbur Knorr, rather than formulating new theories on this aspect of Hypatia's work. He argues that, unlike some other neoplatonists of her time, Hypatia was not opposed to Christianity, and that the Christian mob that killed her likely misunderstood her philosophical position. However, his book has been criticized for treating Hypatia more as an idealized icon, or a caricature of a female mathematician, than as a realistic person of her times. ==See also== * Wine/water paradox ==ReferencesExternal links== *Function magazine Category:1939 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Australian mathematicians Category:Mathematics educators Category:University of Melbourne alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Exeter Category:Monash University faculty Category:Biographers of Hypatia ","title":"Michael A.

Because he was short, the family used him as a jockey, and he rode a colt named Chief Mingo to victory, earning him the nickname Mingo Jack.Howley, Dan. \\"Anniversary of 'Mingo Jack' lynching to be marked; Mingo Jack Remembrance Group to hold March 5 memorial gathering\\", Atlanticville News, March 3, 2011.

The Lairds used Johnson as a slave, and because of his size ‚Äî he was short and stocky ‚Äî as a jockey.\\" In 1840, New Jersey abolished slavery, and Johnson worked odd jobs in the Eatontown and Middletown areas, living in Eatontown near what is now Route 35 and Poplar Road. ==Lynching== In March 1886, a white woman, Angelina Herbert, was raped and beaten. She could not identify her attacker, but reported that the attacker had asked her, \\"Do you know Mingo Jack\\"? Johnson was arrested. That night, a mob of 12 to 20 people chiseled holes in the wall of the jail in which Mingo Jack was held and fired guns, attempting to kill Johnson. When that effort failed, they stormed the jail, beat Johnson and hanged him. A sham trial was held, featuring drunken witnesses and a jury that included the prominent townsman Thomas White, resulting in acquittals for all the defendants. Information from the trial, including testimony from Mrs. Herbert, revealed that Johnson couldn't have been the rapist. No one was convicted for the murder of Mingo Jack, who left behind a wife and five children. Another black man, George Kearney, later confessed to the rape, although that confession may have been coerced. In 2012, Mayor Gerald Tarantolo issued a public apology for the failure of security at the jail, calling the lynching \\"a low point in the history of Eatontown\\".

The music of the piece is by Herv√©, with a text by Hector-Jonathan Cr√©mieux and Adolphe Jaime. The work had its premiere in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Dramatiques on 23 April 1869. ==Background== Gounod's opera Faust, loosely based on episodes from Goethe's drama, had first appeared in Paris in 1859 and had achieved great popularity. Herv√© had produced a number of successful operettas and with this work he and his librettists took the story and added zany comic twists to it. == Main roles== Herv√© {  + !Role !Premiere cast, 23 April 1869 (Conductor: Thibault) - Mephisto (trousers role) Anna Van Ghell - Marguerite Blanche d'Antigny - Faust Herv√© (the composer) - Valentin, Marguerite's brother M.Milher } ==Synopsis==  Act 1  Dr. Faust's schoolroom Dr. Faust, an elderly professor at a boarding school, is experiencing great difficulty in keeping his unruly students including Si√©bel in order. The students pass naughty notes to each other and cover their course work with obscene drawings but use their physical charms to avoid punishment. Valentin enters with other soldiers- he is about to go to war and has brought his sister Marguerite to the school so she can stay there in his absence. Dr. Faust, drawn to Marguerite's supposed innocence and her beauty, accepts her as a student even though she is over school age. Mephisto, the devil, appears to Faust and offers him youth, good looks and wealth in exchange for his powers of reasoning - not his soul, as in Goethe and Gounod, for as the devil says in this version \\"Everyone sells that these days without even signing a contract\\". Marguerite, meanwhile, not as pure and innocent as all that, has run away from the school to go to London to teach the British how to dance the can-can. Faust, now young and rich, in love and not knowing where Marguerite has gone, determines to search the world to find her again, vowing to be hers forever.  Act 2  Le petit Faust, sheet music cover A nightclub Students, pleasure-seekers, and the demimonde are enjoying a night out, dancing and drinking and having fun. Faust enters, tired of a life of empty pleasure and seeking Marguerite. Mephisto has let it be known that Faust has a vast fortune to bestow on Marguerite, and girls claiming to be Marguerite appear from Japan, Italy, France and all over the world, but Faust rejects them all as fake. However, the real Marguerite does turn up at the club, back from teaching the English how to dance the can-can, and Faust is appalled to find such an \\"innocent\\" girl in these seedy surroundings. He is about to whisk her away in his carriage when her brother Valentin appears, back from the war, and is enraged to find Faust attempting to make her his lover. Valentin and Faust fight a duel, and aided by Mephisto, Faust kills Valentin and takes Marguerite away.  Act 3  Marguerite's bedroom Marguerite is waiting for Faust to appear, but is having trouble remembering his name, as she relives the pleasure she has experienced with a number of past lovers, one in particular called Adolphe. Faust comes in and Marguerite tries to give him some idea of her past life, praying to God for forgiveness. About to have supper, Marguerite and Faust are startled by the ghost of Valentin appearing in the soup tureen. The ghost of Marguerite's brother informs her that Faust's huge wealth comes from the devil but she doesn't care. Valentin's ghost also informs her that Faust, in order to be worthy of her, has given all his money to the poor and Faust confirms this, whereupon Marguerite bitterly denounces Faust for killing her brother and declares she wants nothing further to do with him.  Act 4  Walpurgis Night Witches, demons, ghouls and assorted spirits celebrate. Mephisto condemns Faust to fulfill his vow to be with the reluctant Marguerite forever, but her brother Valentin's soul is redeemed and goes to heaven. ==Reception and performance history== Le petit Faust was praised by contemporary critics for its lively and elegant music and ran for over 200 consecutive performances in its first run. The work was given productions in London and other European cities and revived frequently in France throughout the 19th century. It was produced by Alice Oates on Broadway in New York city in 1870 in an English version by Henry B. Farnie under the title Little Faust! A revival in Paris in 1935 featured Fan√©ly Revoil as Mephisto. Recent productions include performances in 2015 at the Staatstheater am G√§rtnerplatz, Munich.

Its built environment extends mainly along Main Street, between Interstate 291 in the south and Strong Road in the north, with a diversity of architecture spanning three centuries. The district includes agricultural fields on both sides, many of which remain in tobacco cultivation. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. ==Description and history== South Windsor was part of Windsor, when that town was settled in the 17th century, and was separately incorporated in 1768. It was always an agricultural community, owing the rich farmlands along the Connecticut River, which separates it from its parent town. Tobacco was from an early date a significant crop, which did particularly well, and was the source of the town's fortunes in the 19th century. Tobacco farmers in the town introduced techniques for regulating temperatures in the sheds used for drying and curing tobacco, which still dot the landscape today. Shade-grown tobacco, particularly prized for use as the wrapping of cigars, was introduced in the town in 1901, and remained an important crop into the 1970s. The Windsor Farms area was the principal settlement in colonial South Windsor. It stretched along Main Street, which was laid out near the edge of a terrace above the bottomlands of the Connecticut River. Houses lined the street, with narrow strips of farmland extending west to the river, and eastward as well. The historic district encompasses all of these resources, an area over in size. In many instances, houses have been replaced by later construction, resulting in a wide variety of architectural styles, despite some consistence in spacing and scale. The district includes the 1845 Greek Revival, First Congregational Church, a district schoolhouse also built in 1845, and the Classical Revival Wood Memorial Library building (1926).

He competed in the ARCA Racing Series, scoring his only career series victory in one of the closest finishes in series history at Atlanta Motor Speedway. ==Personal life== A peanut farmer and a native of Cuthbert, Georgia, DeVane attended Randolph Southern School and is a graduate of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. ==Racing career== DeVane began racing in 1978 at Albany Motor Speedway. Moving to touring series competition in the early 1990s, he made 59 starts in the ARCA Racing Series between 1994 and 1998. In 1995 he won the series' Bill France Four Crown Award, given to the driver with the best finishes on each of the types of tracks (superspeedway, road course, short track, and dirt track) the series competes on, and was the series' co-Rookie of the Year; after fellow rookie Andy Hillenburg became ineligible for the rookie title due to winning the series championship, he was tied with Dill Whittymore, and the series chose to equally award the title to both drivers. He also won the series' Most Popular Driver award that season. DeVane scored one win in the ARCA Racing Series, at Atlanta Motor Speedway in 1997. It was the first race run on the track's current configuration; he led only the last of the final lap of the race, moving from third to first to beat Andy Hillenburg and Frank Kimmel by 0.023 seconds. DeVane also competed on a limited basis in NASCAR competition; in 1994, he attempted to qualify for a Busch Series Grand National Division event at Talladega Superspeedway, but failed to make the field. He also attempted to qualify for two Winston Cup Series races, both at Atlanta Motor Speedway: his first attempt at making his debut in the series was at the NAPA 500 in the fall of 1998, with his second attempt at the Cracker Barrel 500 in the spring of 1999; however, he failed to qualify for either event. He was hospitalized after crashing during his second-round qualifying attempt for the NAPA 500, and withdrew before second- round qualifying in 1999 due to a lack of speed. ==Death== DeVane died on March 1, 2018, after a brief illness at age 54. ==Motorsports career results== NASCAR (key) (Bold ‚Äì Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

There are excellent winter views of Flat Top Mountain, Sharp Top and Peaks of Otter to the east. The area contains the headwaters of prime trout fisheries. The area is part of the Glenwood Cluster. ==Location and access== Boundary of the Cove Mountain wildland in the Jefferson National Forest as identified by the Wilderness Society.The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 4 miles east of Buchanan, Virginia, between the James River on the north, Va 43 on the west, the Blue Ridge Parkway on the south and McFalls Creek Rd (Va 618) on the east. The Forest Service 2015 Motor Vehicle Use Map shows roads and trails in the forest and gives the type of vehicle allowed on each route with possible seasonal restrictions. The maps covering Cove Mountain area (Maps 31 and 32) are included in the gallery below. Caution should be taken when using forest service road numbers since they are not consistent in different maps of the area. Trails and roads into the area include: * Appalachian Trail, 6.6 mil section in wild area, white_blazed * Buchanan Trail, 1.1 miles * a section of the Little Cove Mountain Trail, FS trail 25, 2.8 miles total length, moderate difficulty, blue-blazed. * a section of the Glenwood Horse Trail, FS trail 3004, 65 miles total length, moderate. orange-blazed * Bearwallow Creek Road, Rt. 3055 * Stillhouse Branch Rd, Rt 3053 The Cove Mountain Shelter is on the AT about 3 miles from the trail's crossing of Jennings Creek. The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Map 789. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wildland‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Cove Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Arnold Valley, Buchannan and Montvale. A key to the topographic maps for the northern half of the Jefferson National Forest is in the gallery below. ==Natural history== The habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. According to historians, Bearwallow gap, at the intersection of Va 43 and the Blue Ridge Parkway, was an important path for Buffalo crossing the Blue Ridge Mountain. Until the mid 1700s, buffalo were plentiful in Virginia. There has been a road crossing the gap since the late eighteenth century. McFall‚Äôs Creek special biological area, on the southeast side of the wildarea, contains rare plants such as the orchid nodding pogonia. Invasive plants, such as tree of heaven, Paulownia and autumn olive, are a problem in open areas with roads. clearcuts and game openings. There are several tracts of old growth forest, one near the Appalachian Trail on the south end of the area near Little Cove Mountain Trail, and others to the north and south near the Appalachian Trail. A one-mile long tract on the northeast has trees at least 140 years old. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.Virginia Stream Classification: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: June 18, 2017 Peters Creek, McFalls Creek, Yellowstone Branch and McCoglin Branch are ranked as a class ii trout streams. In 2008, large woody debris enhancement projects in McCoglin Branch and Yellowstone Branch were designed to improve stream habitat for trout and other species by creating small pools that provide habitat for fish. The debris collects organisms for the fish to eat, and protects the streams from erosion during floods. ==Topography== Cove Mountain (elevation 2684 feet) is a spur of the Blue Ridge, stretching from the James River to the Blue Ridge Parkway at Bearwallow Gap. Bearwallow Creek and Jennings Creek, with many tributaries, are the principal drainages of the area. ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. The area was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. In 1930 a forest fire burned 10,000 acres from the Peaks of Otter to Cove Mountain and down the length of Cove Mountain to within a half mile of Arcadia. There was a wildfire in 2005 near Va 43 and Bearwallow Creek, and in 2008 a wildfire in the Little Cove Creek watershed almost reached Va 43. A bulldozed fire line was constructed south of McFalls Ridge and another across Cove Mountain, near the Cove Mountain Shelter and south of the Buchanan Trail. The Appalachian Trail Corridor and old growth tracts are protected from timber cutting. The forest plan for the area includes Ruffed Grouse Habitat, where timber cutting and road building are allowed, and mixed successional habitat which allows logging. ==Nearby Wildlands== Nearby wilderness areas, and wildlands recognized as one of Virginia's \\"Mountain Treasures\\" by the Wilderness Society are: *James River Face Wilderness *Thunder Ridge Wilderness *James River Face Wilderness Addition *White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain *North Creek (conservation area) *Wilson Mountain ==References== Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Protected areas of Botetourt County, Virginia ","title":"Cove Mountain (conservation area)"},{"id":"56128755","text":"The Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, was an important reform during the Protestant Swedish Reformation, in which king Gustav I of Sweden ordered a reduction in church property and the return of land to the crown, making the national church dependent upon the monarch and effectively ending Swedish monastic life. This organised confiscation and transfer of the property of the Swedish Catholic church to the Crown ‚Äì initiated at the V√§ster√•s riksdag of 1527 and finalised in the 1540s ‚Äì was the economic phase of the Swedish Reformation and was followed by the √ñrebro Synod, which dealt with theological matters. ==The reduction== The goal of the reduction was for all church property was to be transferred to the crown, and the independent income of the clergy to be replaced by an allowance or salary paid by the crown. However, the king also wished to strengthen the position of the Swedish nobility, and therefore also allowed for all private donations of lands and estates to churches, bishops and convents since the reign of Charles VIII of Sweden to be retracted by the benefactors, or the families and descendants of the benefactors. Property of Bishops In the Reduction, all goods, lands and assets, particularly the formerly clerical castles, estates and strongholds belonging to Bishops and cathedrals, were to be regarded as Crown property, and the Bishops were from henceforth be provided for by the crown rather than from their own goods, in effect making the church economically dependent on the monarch. This transition was introduced in stages, often during the vacancies between the death of a bishop and the appointment of his successor. Property of Convents Property of monastic institutions in Sweden was subjected to the same rules, and their lands and property declared property of the crown. Each convent was placed under the supervision of a nobleman who was to manage the former convent property for the crown. While the monks and nuns were allowed to remain in their conventual buildings, under government protection and with a state allowance, the monastic communities effectively lost their economic independence, and started to die out. The reform was therefore in effect the dissolution of the Swedish convents. The rule that allowed for the families of former benefactors to retract land and property donated to the church was particularly damaging to the convents. Property of local churches and shrines From 1539, the final stage was introduced, in which the property of local vicars was also declared crown property, and valuables were confiscated from local churches and shrines - a visible sign of the reformation which caused opposition among the peasantry and contributed to the Dalecarlian rebellions and the Dacke War. ==References== * Reduktion, hist., 6.

Allied troops with 16 artillery pieces under the command of the English Captain general the Duke of Marlborough, besieged and captured the small French-held Flemish fortified town of Zoutleeuw in the Spanish Netherlands. ==Prelude== After piercing the French fortified lines Lines of Brabant at Elixheim on 18 July 1705, the Duke of Marlborough found his plans to bring the French army under Duc de Villeroi to a decisive battle frustrated by the French refusal to engage, their extensive use of field fortifications and the unwillingness of the Dutch Field Deputies to submit to his plans. The Allies contented themselves by widening the breach in the lines of Brabant by capturing Zoutleeuw to the north of Eliksem on 5 September. Zoutleeuw had been hastily abandoned by the French troops of the Duke of Berwick in July, after the Allied capture of Huy, with gaps being blown up in the walls. ==Siege== Zoutleeuw, surrounded by swamps, was taken by a small detachment of two battalions troops with 16 artillery pieces under the command of lieutenant general Dedem. The town was invested on 29 August and trenches were opened on 31 August. The Allied siege train arrived from Maastricht on 3 September. That same night, the besiegers attacked and captured a redoubt with little opposition. The infantry battalions carried the trenches within 100 yards of the town, the siege artillery quickly following them. Before the Allied artillery batteries could open fire, the French governor brigadier general Dumont decided to surrender on 4 September after Dedem threatened to kill the entire garrison of 400 men if they continued to resist. The town and citadel were occupied by 200 Allied troops on 5 September. The garrison marched out on 7 September to become prisoners of war in Maastricht, the officers being allowed to retain their swords and baggage. ==Aftermath== The Allies took 10 bronze guns, eight iron guns, two bronze mortars, 10,000 grenades, 200 barrels of gunpowder, 6,000 tools, 2,000 muskets, 100 barrels of musket balls and 18,000 sacks of flour. The siege was the last major Allied operation near the Meuse river as the strong French fortresses of Namur and Charleroi and more tempting targets in Brabant discouraged them from moving upriver. Marlborough had the Lines of Brabant levelled and the town of Tirlemont dismantled. ==CitationsBibliography== * Siege of Zoutleeuw Category:Sieges involving France Category:Sieges involving England Category:Sieges involving Scotland Category:Sieges involving the Dutch Republic Category:Sieges involving the Holy Roman Empire Category:Sieges of the War of the Spanish Succession Category:Battles of the War of the Spanish Succession Category:Battles in Flanders ","title":"Siege of Zoutleeuw"},{"id":"56128877","text":"The Steuerverein (Tax Union) was formed in 1834 as a customs union first of the Duchy of Brunswick and the Kingdom of Hanover and then with the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg in 1836. Hanover joined the Deutscher Zollverein (German Customs Union) in 1854, after negotiating advantageous conditions with Prussia. Facing isolation, Oldenburg followed suit in 1854, thus ending the Steuerverein.The Zollverein and the Formation of a Customs Union, by Florian Ploeckl; Discussion Paper no. 84 in Economic and Social History series, Nuffield College, Oxford, p. 23. Retrieved from www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/Economics/History March 2017 == Beginnings == Steuerverein in the 1840s Orange: Steuerverein Blue: Zollverein Special arrangements in Minden area Moves to a north German customs alliance occurred in 1830, when Hanover, the Electorate of Hesse, the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg and Brunswick concluded the Einbeck Treaty as a supplement to the Central German Commercial Union. This provided for tariff free trade between the contracting parties and a common customs administration and external tariff. Excluded from the regulation were the trade in salt (a state monopoly). Since the contracting parties could not reach an agreement on the amount of the external customs duties, the contract did not come into force. In addition, Electoral Hesse joined the Prussian-Hessian Customs Union instead. A new attempt to forge a north German customs union was made and an agreement between Hanover and Brunswick came into force on 1 June 1835. The two states agreed a customs union with internal tariff free trade, a common external tariff and a common customs administration. The customs revenue was divided according to their respective populations. The external tariffs on materials imported from overseas and on finished goods were below the rates of the Deutscher Zollverein. Like the previous agreement, salt was excluded from internal tariff free trade.Deutscher Zollverein article in German Wikipedia == Relations with Zollverein == The Steuerverein did not arise from hostility to the Prussian customs unions, but rather from the requirements of a population upon which the higher duties of the Zollverein external tariff would have been injurious because of import duties on articles of consumption, especially colonial produce, of which Hanover was a large importer.Hanover: Report by G. G. Petre, Secretary of the British Legation in Hanover,dated15 July 15, 1860. Publ. In UK Parliamentary Papers, House of Commons Session 5 Feb ‚Äì 6 Aug 1861, Vol LXIII. See pp 163-165 In 1837 a Convention between the Zollverein and Steuerverein was signed which greatly reduced Zollverein import duties on imports from the Steuerverein States, such as corn, hops, butter, leather, iron, glass, and earthenware; duties on linen and linen-yarn were entirely removed. In return, the Steuerverein took measures to suppress smuggling into the Zollverein, including adjustments of outlying territory to provide a more easily policed customs cordon. Parts of the Steuerverein member states did not belong to the Steuerverein territory. Provinces of Oldenburg situated in other parts of Germany, namely the Duchy of Birkenfeld and the Principality of L√ºbeck, were not included. Likewise some exclaves of Brunswick and Hanover. Many of these excluded areas were included in the Prussian customs administration. Conversely, some Prussian exclaves and the county Minden in Prussia were connected to the Steuerverein. The Principality of Schaumburg- Lippe joined in 1838. The detached part of Electoral Hesse known as the County of Schaumburg (which bordered independent Schaumburg Lippe) remained outside of the Steuerverein. Negotiations took place between Hanover and Prussia, prior to the defection of Brunswick, but Electoral Hesse vetoed this prospect.Wirtschaftliche Integration im 19. Jahrhundert: Die hessischen Staaten und der Deutsche Zollverein, by Hans-Werner Hahn, publ. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1997; pp . 227-230 The Prussian government district of Minden formed a salient into the territory of the Steuerverein. By agreement with Hanover, Oldenburg and Brunswick, the Prussian government joined various parts of the district of Minden to the Steuerverein (1841). Due to the geographical location, the inhabitants of the neighbouring parts of the Steuerverein habitually used the town of Minden for the sale of their arable and livestock farming products. Prussia allowed this trade to continue duty free so that Minden could continue to benefit as a market centre for the region.Verhandlungen der vierten General Konferenz in Zollvereins- Angelegenheiten, publ.

Brunswick insisted upon its outlying dependencies being included with the Zollverein, resulting in extensive smuggling along interlacing portions of Hanoverian and Brunswick territory. So the two unions agreed by treaty in 1845 that the Hartz and Weser districts of Brunswick were reincorporated in the Steuerverein. This treaty and six supplementary agreements facilitated trade across their mutual customs border.Henderson, p.159 == Tariff Regime == In 1846 Hanover reached a trade agreement making important tariff concessions to the United States of America. Oldenburg followed suit in 1847. At this time Steuerverein production was mainly agricultural and largely exported, whilst the consumption of imports per capita was reckoned to be more than double that of the Zollverein. Accession to the Zollverein, under the external tariff then in force, would raise the import duties on articles of consumption, especially on Colonial produce, resulting in an increase in the cost of living, and thus also of production. For example, sugar duties in the Zollverein were 9 thalers per quintal (i.e. a hundredweight or 50 kg), but only 3 thalers in the Steuerverein. The Zollverein duty on wine was 48 thalers per hogshead (this Hanoverian measure being equal to 234 litres), while in the Steuerverein it was only 18 thalers. The same disparity existed between the duties on raw and manufactured iron. The Hanoverian and Prussian thaler (or dollar) was equivalent to 2s 10¬æd sterling. In 1850, Austria proposed an amalgamation of the three customs unions in Germany, that of the Austrian Empire, the Zollverein and the Steuerverein (the first two including territories beyond the German Confederation). However the tariff regimes of the three unions were quite different. The Austrian was hitherto a prohibitive tariff, whilst the Zollverein had a protective tariff and the Steuerverein a financial tariff (i.e. tax raising rather than protecting domestic industry). This scheme if realised would change the tariff of the Zollverein towards higher duties, rather than cause it to be assimilated to the lower tariff of the Steuerverein. Thus the proposal was received with little favour in the Steuerverein, especially the government and press of Hanover. == End of the Steuerverein == However, Prussia decided to draw in the Steuerverein states into the Zollverein, even at the cost of large concessions, which might risk the defection of south German states from the Zollverein. Negotiations were held between Rudolf von Delbr√ºck, Ministerial-Director of the Prussian Ministry of Commerce and Dr. Otto Klenze, General-Director for Indirect Taxes in the Hanoverian Interior Ministry. As both states wanted to avoid Austria frustrating their progress, this was kept secret.Henderson, p.214 Hof & Staats Handbuch f√ºr das K√∂nigreich Hannover; p. 297 in 1847 edition (Google Books) A treaty was soon agreed between Prussia and Hanover on 7 September 1851, by which Hanover joined the Zollverein on 1 January 1854. Hanover negotiated most favourable terms. As well as her share of the Zollverein customs and tax revenues in proportion to her population, Hanover received an annual \\"praecipium\\", which was a bonus amounting to two-thirds of her entitlement to net receipts of the Zollverein. The initial estimate of the \\"praecipium\\" was 767,000 thalers (¬£115,000 sterling). This was to compensate for the loss of profits from the transit trade, and as a consideration for the greater consumption of taxed articles, such as foreign wines and colonial produce, compare with the Zollverein. Also, import duties on wine, coffee, molasses, tea, and brandy were reduced (by 50% in the case of brandy). Another concession was that British iron could be imported free of duty, for the completion of the Hanoverian railway lines, for a limited period. Throughout Hanover, where the benefit of low tariffs were greatly valued, the accession to the Zollverein caused much dissatisfaction and a ministerial crisis. However, the treaty was ratified by the legislature in 1852. This treaty was signed only by Prussia and Hanover. Prussia had not consulted any member of the Zollverein and Hanover had not consulted Oldenburg or Schaumburg-Lippe, who were both forced to follow Hanover into the Zollverein. By an agreement between Hanover and Schaumburg-Lippe on 25 September 1851, the latter adhered to the arrangements in the Prussia-Hanover treaty. Oldenburg acceded by means of a treaty with Hanover and Prussia (jointly) dated 1 March 1, 1852.Henderson, p.215 Both the Zollverein and Steuerverein treaties were due to expire in 1853, which provided the opportunity to negotiate new terms. == Notes  References == * Henderson, William.

He gained notice for his controversial remarks while running in 2016 and 2018 in the Republican Party's primary election in Wisconsin. He was soundly defeated by incumbent Paul Ryan in the first primary election and also defeated in the second primary by Bryan Steil, who would go on to win the general election for U.S. Representative from Wisconsin's 1st congressional district. He lost by 68 points to Ryan in 2016 and again to Steil in 2018. Nehlen has been rejected by the Wisconsin Republican Party, and by some white nationalists. An April 2018 article in The Daily Beast declared that Nehlen was becoming one of the highest profile white nationalists in the United States, but he has been unsuccessful politically, also losing the support of Breitbart News. His online accounts have been closed at Twitter and Gab because of his postings. Since early 2018 he has gained notice only for controversial remarks and largely disappeared from coverage in 2019. == Early life == Nehlen was born in Ohio, and has lived in Delavan, Wisconsin since 2014. He became a successful businessman and had stints at Deltech Engineering / United Dominion Industries and SPX Corporation, and he served until 2016 as the Senior VP of Operations at Neptune-Benson LLC, a subsidiary of Evoqua Water Technologies. He holds several patents related to filtering and manufacturing methods. In 2014 he registered a consulting business, Blue Skies Global LLC. It does not appear to have conducted any business to date. Nehlen was an advisory board member from the Midwest Region of Operation Homefront until 2016. == Views == Nehlen has espoused alt-right, racist, white nationalist, and antisemitic views. He has used white nationalist memes to spread his message. Nehlen frequently uses the slogan: \\"It's OK to be white.\\" He was formerly backed by Steve Bannon. Nehlen endorsed Republican Roy Moore in the 2017 Alabama U.S. Senate special election. A few have said his views and actions show he has neo-Nazi ideology and he has been endorsed by neo-Nazis.  Lawful speech  On December 14, 2017, Nehlen's campaign for the 2018 congressional election released a statement calling for a federal law banning large social media companies from censoring or restricting \\"lawful speech\\" on their platforms. Nehlen's proposed bill includes fines of $500,000 for each violation. Supporters of Nehlen have used the hashtag #ShallNotCensor online to show their support for this position. Limitations to \\"lawful speech\\" would include \\"No publishing any individual's nonpublic residential address, telephone number, or email address without their consent\\". However, Nehlen's campaign has posted private phone and email addresses without their consent on the website and then tweeted a link to them.  Jews  On Twitter, he suggested Ari Cohn convert to Christianity to \\"fill a Jesus-shaped hole\\" inside of him. Nehlen said he was reading The Culture of Critique (1998) by Kevin B. MacDonald and described it as \\"outstanding so far\\". He called John Cardillo and Kurt Schlichter \\"shekels- for-hire\\" and posted a tweet with the antisemitic catchphrase \\"The goyim know\\" (referencing a theory about an alleged Jewish conspiracy). In a text message sent to The Washington Post, Nehlen said, \\"I reject being called a White Supremacist, because clearly Pro-White isn't White Supremacy unless Pro-Jewish is Jewish Supremacy.\\" In a discussion with neo-Nazi Patrick Little on an alt- right podcast, Nehlen formally endorsed genocide. He is quoted as saying he wouldn't be \\"opposed to somebody ... leadin‚Äô a million Robert Bowers to the promised land.\\"  Political opponents  Nehlen also posted on Twitter a picture of Paul Ryan and Randy Bryce being dropped out of a helicopter, a reference to death flights, a method of executing political opponents used by South American autocratic governments during the late 20th century.  Donald Trump  While running against incumbent Paul Ryan in the 2016 Republican primary for the seat representing Wisconsin's 1st congressional district, Nehlen was supportive of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, but was swamped by Ryan. By 2018, however, he was criticizing Trump, describing him as a \\"cuck\\" and a failure.  Meghan Markle  On February 9, 2018, Nehlen tweeted an image of Prince Harry with an offensive picture superimposed over the face of his American, biracial fiance Meghan Markle, with the words \\"Honey, does this tie make my face look pale?\\" Nehlen was subsequently suspended from Twitter. He objected to this as a violation of his free speech.  Border wall and immigrants  In late February 2018, Nehlen was a guest on the radio show of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke commenting to Duke that Trump's proposed border wall should include automatic turrets. Nehlen stated that any Mexican immigrant who approaches the American border should \\"be treated as an enemy combatant. Man, woman or child.\\" == Social media bans == In February 2018, after a series of racist and antisemitic tweets, he was permanently suspended, or banned from Twitter. The Republican Party of Wisconsin has cut off ties with Nehlen, saying that his \\"ideas have no place in the Republican Party\\". In April 2018, Nehlen allegedly doxed alt- right people that he saw as too moderate, willing to compromise, or unwilling to take militant street action. Gab, which is considered by some to be an alt- right version of Twitter, banned Nehlen for doxing a troll who went by the name Ricky Vaughn. After doxxing the troll, who gained notoriety by posting popular racist and antisemitic memes, Nehlen claimed that the troll's real name is Douglass Mackey. In May 2019, Facebook, Inc. banned Nehlen and other controversial right-wing figures, including Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, and Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Paul Joseph Watson from the company's platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. == Political career == 2016 primary For his run in the 2016 Wisconsin's 1st congressional district primaries, he received endorsements from Breitbart News and the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund and people such as Laura Ingraham and Sarah Palin. He was defeated, getting 16% of the votes versus Paul Ryan with 84% of the votes. When he posted a ballot selfie on election day, the Town of Delavan police said he had committed election fraud, a Class I felony. The police said he deliberately delayed an investigation by doing a factory reset on the phone and erasing the SIM card. Assistant District Attorney Haley Johnson said the ballot selfie was \\"technically a violation\\" of law, but decided not to issue criminal charges, stating Nehlen had \\"ignorantly posted the image to draw attention to his candidacy,\\" and not vote buying. Johnson wrote \\"It is unfortunate that Mr. Nehlen showed such little regard for a law enforcement investigation.\\" 2018 primary Nehlen ran again in the 2018 Republican primary against Nick Polce for the seat vacated by Paul Ryan, who was retiring. He was backed by Steve Bannon until Roy Moore was defeated. Nehlen has alienated Breitbart and has been strongly criticized by the group. On December 27, 2017, Bannon's adviser Arthur Schwartz said Nehlen is \\"dead to us\\" and \\"Bannon cut all ties with him and tossed him to the curb.\\" Breitbart senior editor Joel Pollak said: \\"We don't support him.\\" On December 27, Pollak tweeted that Breitbart had not covered Nehlen in months. On December 18, 2017 he was a featured guest on Curt Schilling's Breitbart radio show Whatever It Takes; Schilling unequivocally expressed his endorsement of Nehlen. Callum Borchers of The Washington Post said \\"Breitbart's move is political calculus\\" because it \\"needs to align itself with politicians who can win to help regain the appearance of influence Moore's defeat damaged.\\" On February 13, 2018, Wisconsin GOP spokesman Alec Zimmerman said, \\"Nehlen and his ideas have no place in the Republican Party.\\" Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said, \\"It looks to me like he's a racist bigot.\\" Ryan's campaign spokesman Kevin Seifert said, \\"It has long been clear that Paul Nehlen holds bigoted views.\\" Nehlen responded with, \\"I am a member of the Republican Party regardless of what their traitorous, spineless apparatchiks believe,\\" adding his agenda should \\"be the centerpiece of the Republican Party.\\" ==Private life== Nehlen is married to Gabriela Lira, they have had no children together, he has two adult sons from a previous marriage. == Electoral history == {class= !colspan=6U.S. House of Representatives, Wisconsin's 1st district, Republican primary, 2016 - !colspan=2 Party !Candidate !Votes !% - Republican Paul Ryan align=center57,364 align=center84.06 - Republican Paul Nehlen align=center10,864 align=center15.92 - Scattering N/A align=center15 align=center0.02 - !colspan=3; right;\\"Total !align=center68,243 !align=center100 } { + !colspan=5U.S House of Representatives, Wisconsin's 1st district Republican primary, 2018 - !colspan=2Party !CandidateThese are candidates who have announced the intention to run; nominating papers must be filed by June 1, 2018.

The country is a signatory of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and has criminalized the production and distribution of the drug. El Salvador (along with Peru and Bolivia) is one of the most conservative countries in Latin America in regard to drug policy. According to a 2016 study published by the International Journal of Drug Policy, only 17% of Salvadorans reported having used cannabis. ==Decriminalization efforts== In 2014, over 700 people protested in San Salvador in favor of decriminalizing the consumption and personal cultivation of cannabis. The demonstration was organized by the activist group La Mar√≠a Guanaca and backed by the Evangelical Protestant Church of El Salvador. However, support for cannabis reform remains very low.

Two years later he would become an officer and in the following years prove himself multiple times during the Caucasian War. In 1847 he was promoted to Lieutenant and in 1847 to staff captain. He was heavily involved with his regiment in the Crimean War and received several high decorations and citations. In 1855 the captain was wounded in battle, receiving a bullet that partially penetrated his skull. At the end of the Crimean war Chavchavadze returned to the Caucasus to continue participate in the Caucasian campaigns. For his successes he earned several more decorations including the Gold Sword for Bravery and Order of Saint Stanislaus. On 25 June he got promoted to senior lieutenant and took command over several cavalry regiments until his promotion to major-general in 1874. General Chavchavadze subsequently participated in the Russo-Turkish War, particularly its Caucasian theatre, the decisive battle at mount Avliyar and the Battle of Kars.

After taking command over several consolidated cavalry divisions of the Caucasian provinces he was appointed commander of the 1st Caucasian Army Corps until his death in 1905.

It was the first Synod in Sweden since the introduction of the Protestant Swedish Reformation in 1527, and regarded as the theological completion of the Reformation, following the economic policy of the Reformation introduced at the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden in 1527. It did not abolish the Catholic rituals, but adopted a policy aimed to make them slowly cease to be performed. The theological reforms were at this point not radically changed. There were three important reforms taken at this synod: # The Bishops were to control that all the parish vicars used only the unaltered words of the Bible in their sermons. Vicars and priests were to be tutored in the words of the scripture and to secure this: scholars with knowledge were to be appointed to control the vicars of every city parish to ensure this, and city priests were to inspect the parish vicars of the country to ensure that only what which could be found in the Bible was preached there, effectively putting the messages of the sermons under control. # Bishops were allowed to give dispense for several of the marriages previously banned because of to close relations. The church was allowed to practice punishment for worldly crimes when secular justice was found lacking. The Monks were, as were the priests, also subjected to control to ensure that they did not preach other than what could be found in the Bible. The Feast days to the Saints was to be suppressed, with the exception of the feast days of God himself, the Virgin Mary and the memorial days of the patron saints of each church. # The rituals of the church, such as pilgrimages, statues and relics of saints and other Catholic habits were to be allowed to continue. However, they were to be \\"explained\\" and demystified, in an effort to make people discontinue them of their own free will. For example: while the statues of the saints were allowed to remain in the churches, the public were to be instructed that they were not to be objects of religious worship, but only to be used as memorials of religious role models. Similarly, while pilgrimages to holy places were not to be stopped, people were to be instructed that they were merely made to be a meditative experience, and not to be regarded as a religious act which could bring the performer any absolution or any other religious benefit. ==References== * Carl Alfred Cornelius: Svenska kyrkans historia efter reformationen, f√∂rra delen (1520-1693), 1886‚Äì87 .

An Imperial army under the command of Field Marshal Johann Karl von Th√ºngen, besieged and captured the French fortified city of Haguenau on the banks of the Rhine river in Alsace. While the main Allied army under the Duke of Marlborough was operating against French in the Spanish Netherlands, a French army under Marshal Claude de Villars in Alsace captured Wissembourg in early July and attempted to dislodge the Imperials from their position near Lauterbourg; but the attempt was beaten off by the Imperial Field Marshal Johann Karl von Th√ºngen who had taken over from the ill Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden. A French detachment captured Homburg on 27 July, the Palatinate garrison agreeing to retire to Mannheim. On 28 August, the Imperial forces, now commanded by the Margrave of Baden and reinforced by 16,000 Prussian and Palatinate troops in 10 Prussian infantry battalions and 20 cavalry squadrons, breached the Lines of Haguenau, a French line of field fortifications, advanced into Lower Alsace and laid siege, first to Drusenheim and then to Haguenau on 27 September, the latter falling on 5 October. After a slender resistance, the French garrison offered to surrender with conditions but was rebuffed by Th√ºngen, who demanded their imprisonment. Leaving 400 men and the sick and wounded inside to distract the Allies, the French governor Peri escaped Haguenau under the cover of night toward Saverne with some 2,000 of his troops, the incomplete Imperial investment of 20 squadrons of Prussian and W√ºrttemberger infantry failing to stop them. The 400-strong detachment escaped soon after. Louis of Baden was outraged by this failure. The sieges concluded the campaign season, the opposing armies withdrawing to winter quarters later that month. The Imperials had established a bridgehead across the Rhine. ==References== Citations Bibliography * * Siege of Hagenau Category:Sieges involving France Category:Sieges involving the Holy Roman Empire Category:Sieges involving Prussia Category:Sieges of the War of the Spanish Succession Category:Battles of the War of the Spanish Succession ","title":"Siege of Haguenau (1705)"},{"id":"56129265","text":"Viktoria Pinther (born 16 October 1998) is an Austrian footballer who plays as a forward for Bayer Leverkusen in the Frauen Bundesliga.

It was destroyed in 2006, then rebuilt in 2013, and then destroyed again in 2016 by ISIL. ==Description== Archaeologists estimate the construction of the tower dates back to the late Abbasid era. It is considered established during the period from 996 to 1096 CE, judging from the Abbasid architectural style, inscriptions and other elements of the building. It was originally built on the island of Labad on the Euphrates river by the Uqaylid dynasty of Mosul. The architectural style was notably different from the other Abbasid era minarets.Manaret al-‚ÄòAnah. Archnet. Retrieved December 25, 2017. The tower reached the height of approximately and consists of eight levels. It had square shaped platform and 64 niches on the octagonal frame. It was slightly leaning, although the angle was less compared to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. In the mid-80s, the late president Saddam Hussein inaugurated several dams in Euphrates river in order to secure the stable supply of water, affecting the region where the tower was located and resulted in the potential danger of tower submerging into the water. Team of Iraqi archaeological experts had cooperated with the UAE mission to dismantle the tower into 28 pieces and relocate into nearby site. ==2006 destruction and 2013 restoration== In 2006, the tower was destroyed by the explosion caused by the unknown perpetrator. The explosion was considered among the series of events which targeted Iraqi cultural heritage sites, including the statue of Abu Ja‚Äôafar al-Mansur in Baghdad.

II, p. 275. He was as a key participant in the failed republican Municipal Library Elevator Coup of 1908, which targeted the Constitutional monarchy of King Charles I and what were perceived as the dictatorial powers of his then prime minister Jo√£o Franco. == Early life and marriage == Jo√£o Ayres de Campos was born in Coimbra, the eldest son of Jo√£o Maria Correia Ayres de Campos and his wife Maria Am√©lia de Sande Mexia Vieira da Mota, niece and sole heir of Carlos Pinto Vieira da Mota, 1st Count of Juncal. He was granted the courtesy title Viscount of Ameal (Portuguese: Visconde do Ameal) by Carlos I of Portugal in 1901, at the age of 23, upon his father's accession to the peerage as Count of Ameal. These titles were confirmed by king Manuel II in exile in 1920.Various authors, Anu√°rio da Nobreza de Portugal (Lisboa, 1985), vol. I, p. 220. He would succeed in the comital title at his father's death in 1920. On 21 November 1901 he married Maria Benedita Falc√£o Barbosa de Azevedo e Bourbon, issued from a prominent Bragan family and sister of the 2nd Count of Azevedo. == Revolutionary politics and attempted coup == Plans of Mesnier de Ponsard's elevator near the Municipal Library in Lisbon, owned by the then Viscount of Ameal In 1905, Jo√£o Ayres de Campos was part of the Dissid√™ncia Progressista, an influential left-wing breakaway from the Partido Progressista in the last years of Portugal's Liberal Monarchy, led by Jos√© Maria de Alpoim.Maltez, Jos√© Adelino (coord.).

With several members of this group and in cooperation with Costa's Republican Party, Jo√£o (then styled Viscount of Ameal) was involved in the failed Municipal Library Elevator Coup, one month before the Lisbon Regicide.Abreu, Jorge de, O 5 de Outubro - A Revolu√ß√£o Portuguesa (Texto Editores, 2010), chapter VI, \\"A 'ratoeira' do elevador, insucesso do complot\\". The coup derives its name from the large public elevator designed by (Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard) and owned by Ameal near Lisbon City Hall which served as the conspirators' headquarters, and where many would be arrested on the afternoon of 28 January 1908.Cabral, Ant√≥nio.

His later public life was developed under the auspices of the First Portuguese Republic. However, he eventually became disillusioned with the new regime's instability, and by the early 1930s he welcomed the dawn of Salazar's authoritarian Estado Novo - of which his son Jo√£o Francisco de Barbosa Azevedo de Sande Ayres de Campos, later 3rd Count of Ameal, was one of the leading ideologues.Pinto, Antonieta Maria da Silva.

It has five branches and a central library in downtown Spokane, along with a bookmobile and online services. The library system was acquired by the municipal government in 1894 and is funded by the city budget and a separate property tax. ==History== The Spokane Public Library was established in 1894, after two unsuccessful attempts at creating a library system in the city. The system was acquired by the city from the Union Library Association, a partnership between the Sorosis Club and Carpenters Union, who had started the private library in 1891. The library rented space inside the city hall's basement, with a permanent location sought with funding from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The three-story Carnegie library opened in 1904 at the western edge of downtown. The library system established three branches, also built with funds from Carnegie, in the early 1910s. The downtown library was replaced in 1963 with a branch in the Comstock Building, a former Sears Roebuck department store. A bond issue passed by voters in 1990 enabled the library system to replace all four of its locations, including the Comstock branch. The current five-branch system and downtown library were all completed by 1998. In 2013, voters approved a property tax to partially fund library services, alongside allocated funds from the city budget. It was renewed by a referendum in 2017. ==Branches== The Spokane Public Library system has six total locations, including branches established in the early 20th century.

She is also a visiting professor at the Department of Environmental Science of the University of Calcutta. Swarnakar resides along Lake Road in Kolkata. == Legacy == Turmeric rhizome and powder Swarnakar's research is focused on cancer biology and she is known to have conducted basic and translational research on various types of cancers such as lung, brain, oral, breast, pancreatic, blood and cervical cancers. She led a team of scientists who worked on the therapeutic properties of turmeric and they identified that the controlled dosage of curcumin, an ingredient of turmeric which gave the rhizome its yellow color, acted as a therapeutic agent for gastric inflammation and ulceration. They demonstrated that curcumin increased MMP2 enzyme level while deceasing the MMP9 enzyme, thus ensured balance of the two enzymes which acted in opposite ways in the formation of new blood vessels. They also proposed a treatment protocol for gastric ulcers with the use of nanocapsules and antioxidants where quercetin, an antioxidant present in apples, tomatoes and onions is administered through nanocapsules to treat ethanol-induced gastric ulcers. Her studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 103 of them. Besides, she has contributed chapters to books edited by others. She has also delivered invited or plenary speeches at science conferences and has mentored several scholars in their post-graduate and doctoral studies. Swarnakar is member of the governing body of the ANB Memorial Foundation, a trust in memory of Amar Nath Bhaduri, the noted chemical biologist she was the secretary of the organizing committee of the 2nd International Meet on Advanced Studies on Cell Signaling Network (CeSiN 2014) held in Kolkata.

He was one of many followers of the works of John Ruskin, and was known as an American Pre-Raphaelite. In 1871, Moore left painting to begin teaching at Harvard, where he led its new art department. There Moore was among the first art historians at an academic institution in the United States. After retirement, Moore moved to Hampshire, England. He wrote many books on medieval and Renaissance architecture there, and died in Hampshire in 1930. ==Early life== Charles Moore was born on April 10, 1840 on Bleecker Street in New York City. His parents, Charles Moore and Jane Maria Berendtson had Puritanical roots. Both were religious; his father was a Quaker and his mother a Swedenborgian, something she led her son to find interest in. He became the first of three brothers and six sisters, and was educated in New York City public schools. He did not attend college. ==Career== Moore began learning landscape painting in the 1850s at the Thirteenth Street School, and with Benjamin H. Coe in 1853 in New York City. Moore began exhibiting at the National Academy of Design in 1858, and was elected as an associate of the organization in 1862. He began to read the works of John Ruskin and began renting space at the Tenth Street Studio Building in 1859. That year, he also made his first known trip to the Catskill Mountains, and exhibited In the Catskills at the academy the following year. In 1861, Moore gave up the New York City studio and moved to Catskill, New York, and rented a studio from Theodore Cole, son of artist Thomas Cole. At this time, he was considered a minor member of the Hudson River School art movement. In 1863, he became a founder and one of few members of the Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art, a short-lived organization centered on the Pre-Raphaelite tradition of truthful and highly realistic artistic depictions. His art began to align with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, which he became known for. He was eager to spread Ruskin's and Pre-Raphaelite instruction, and applied as an instructor of drawing at Vassar College. From 1865 to 1869, Moore finished a major winter study in oil paint each winter, and made six meticulously painted oil landscapes, along with still lifes and nature studies in pencil and in oil. In July 1865, Moore married Mary Jane Tomlinson, of Schenectady, New York. They moved into a cottage a half mile north of Catskill, where they remained residents year-round until fall of 1871. The stone and timber house was directly north of Cole's Cedar Grove residence and across the Hudson from Frederic Church's Olana. In 2004, the property became the Catwalk Institute, an artist and writer residency founded by James and Purcell Palmer. Around 1866, Moore became an early member of the American Watercolor Society. In 1871, he was appointed Instructor of Freehand Drawing at the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moore moved to Cambridge with his wife that year. He was the first professor of art at Harvard, along with Charles Eliot Norton, who initially recommended him to Harvard. During his tenure, from 1876 to 1878, Moore took a paid leave of absence to Italy; there he studied with John Ruskin. They sketched architecture, discussed aesthetics, and studied paintings by the Old Masters. In 1880, his wife died; he then married Elizabeth Fisk Hewins the following year (she outlived him, dying in 1933). Around 1890, Moore went to France to study its architecture, particularly the Gothic style. In 1891, Moore became an assistant professor at the university, and was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree. In 1895, Moore became a curator at the school's Fogg Art Museum when it opened. In the following year, he became a full professor and the first director of the Fogg Art Museum, where he served until 1909. He retired in 1909 and was designated Professor Emeritus at Harvard. That year he moved to Hartley Wintney in Hampshire, England. At that time, Moore wrote numerous books on medieval and Renaissance architecture. He died in Hartley Wintney on February 15, 1930. Moore was an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects and the Royal Institute of British Architects. ==Selected works== * * * ==ReferencesExternal links== * Major works by Moore at American Gallery * Works at Internet Archive Category:1840 births Category:1930 deaths Category:19th-century American painters Category:20th- century American painters Category:American architectural historians Category:American art historians Category:American landscape painters Category:American male painters Category:Artists from New York City Category:Directors of museums in the United States Category:Fellows of the Royal Institute of British Architects Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Honorary Fellows of the American Institute of Architects Category:Hudson River School painters Category:National Academy of Design members Category:Painters from New York (state) Category:People from Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:People from Catskill, New York Category:Pre- Raphaelite painters Category:Historians from Massachusetts Category:Historians from New York (state) Category:19th-century male artists ","title":"Charles Herbert Moore"},{"id":"56129710","text":"Khan al-Rubu courtyard.

Born near Magnitogorsk, Seifullina was the daughter of a peasant woman, who died when she was five, and a Tatar raised by an Orthodox priest; her father would go on to become a priest himself. She began working at 17, publishing her first short stories in 1917 and graduating from the Moscow Higher Pedagogical Courses in 1920. She moved to Novosibirsk and there wrote the short novel Four Chapters, which was published in 1922 and earned her some notice. Sue continued to write stories and novels depicting the clash between the new order and the old. After the 1920s she turned more to journalism and education. She is best known for her short story \\"Virineia\\", about a peasant woman who, having become a believer in Soviet ideals, begins to chafe at the restrictions placed on her by traditional patriarchal society. It serves as the basis for an opera by Sergei Slonimsky, completed in 1967. Seifullina was married to the literary critic and journalist Valerian Pravdukhin, who assisted in adapting \\"Virineia\\" as a play that was greatly popular in Soviet theaters. He was executed in 1939 during the Great Purge, and some sources claim that as the wife of an \\"enemy of the people\\" she was arrested and sent to the gulag, released only after the death of Joseph Stalin. Other sources state that she remained free and living in Moscow, aiding the war effort. It was in that city that she died. ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1954 deaths Category:People from Chebarkulsky District Category:People from Orenburg Governorate Category:Russian people of Tatar descent Category:Soviet novelists Category:Soviet women novelists Category:Russian women novelists Category:20th-century Russian novelists Category:20th-century Russian women writers Category:Soviet short story writers Category:Russian women short story writers Category:Soviet journalists Category:Russian women journalists Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Lidiia Seifullina"},{"id":"56129906","text":"Ryan Blake may refer to: *Ryan Blake (footballer) (born 1991), Northern Ireland association footballer *Ryan Blake (tennis) (born 1966), American NBA scout and former tennis player ","title":"Ryan Blake"},{"id":"56129931","text":"Gary Henderson may refer to: *Gary Henderson (baseball coach), American college baseball coach *Gary Henderson (playwright) (born 1955), New Zealand playwright, director and teacher *Gary Henderson (tennis) (born 1969), British former professional tennis player ","title":"Gary Henderson"},{"id":"56129935","text":"Nessos of Chios (Ancient Greek: ŒùŒµœÉœÉ·æ∂œÇ or ŒùŒ≠œÉœÉŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ Œß·øñŒøœÇ) was a pre-Socratic ancient Greek philosopher from the island of Chios. == Biography == Little is known about the life and work of Nessos.

Won by series champion Jeff Gordon, the race was delayed both before its start and twice during the race due to rain showers, causing it to be shortened to 221 laps from its scheduled distance of 325 laps. This was the last race without Tony Stewart until 2013 Cheez-It 355 at The Glen. ==Background== Atlanta Motor Speedway is one of ten intermediate to hold NASCAR races; the others are Charlotte Motor Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Darlington Raceway, Homestead Miami Speedway, Kansas Speedway, Kentucky Speedway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway, New Hampshire Motor Speedway, and Texas Motor Speedway. The standard track at Atlanta Motor Speedway is a four- turn quad-oval track that is long. The track's turns are banked at twenty-four degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, and the back stretch are banked at five. The scheduled race distance was 325 laps, totalling . Going into the race, Jeff Gordon had clinched the 1998 Winston Cup Series championship the previous weekend at North Carolina Motor Speedway, winning the AC Delco 400 for his 12th win of the season. Rookie driver Harris DeVane, a regular on the ARCA Racing Series, attempted to make his Winston Cup Series debut at the event. The support race for the event, run on Saturday afternoon, was a 102-lap event sanctioned by the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series; Mike Swaim Jr. was the winner of the race. ==Qualifying== Race polesitter Kenny Irwin Jr. Series rookie Kenny Irwin Jr., driving the No. 28 Ford Taurus for Robert Yates Racing, led 48 drivers in qualifying on Friday, November 6, winning his first pole position in the Winston Cup Series. Irwin's qualifying time was . Ward Burton qualified second in the No. 22 Bill Davis Racing Pontiac; Dale Jarrett, Mark Martin, and Mike Skinner filled out the remainder of the top five positions in qualifying; the top 25 drivers in the session were locked into the field, with Ted Musgrave as the 25th and final driver guaranteed a starting spot at the end of the first day of time trials. Second round qualifying, to set starting positions 26th through 36th on the grid, was held on Saturday, November 7. Gary Bradberry set the fastest time in the session at a speed of ; he had crashed in the first round of qualifying, and was forced to use a backup car for the rest of the race weekend. The only other driver to make an attempt in second round qualifying and move into the top 36 positions, qualifying for the race, was Kevin Lepage, whose time placed him 31st overall. Dale Earnhardt, Terry Labonte, Ricky Craven, Johnny Benson Jr., Kyle Petty, and Rusty Wallace were forced to take provisional starting positions to start the race. Darrell Waltrip received a provisional as a past series champion and started 43rd; it was the 20th provisional he had used over the course of the season, resulting in a change to eligibility rules for the 1999 series season. Failing to qualify for the race were Rick Mast, Rich Bickle, Steve Grissom, Andy Hillenburg, and Harris DeVane; DeVane was injured in a crash on his qualifying lap and had to be cut from his car, being taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure. ==Race== The start of the race, scheduled for 12:40PM, was delayed 49 minutes due to rain. During the race two additional red flags for rain caused delays of 6 hours and 39 minutes. The delays resulted in the race being the first night race held at the speedway. Due to the delays, during a yellow flag thrown on lap 190 to allow teams to pit under caution on the still-damp pit road, NASCAR announced that once the race resumed, there would be only 25 laps remaining from that point, citing a desire for fans to be able to return home at a safe hour; the race concluded at 11:07pm, a crowd of 50,000 having remained to watch the race to its conclusion. From a starting position of 21st, Gordon led 113 of the race's 221 laps; he beat Dale Jarrett for the race win by 0.739 second. His victory, the 13th on the season, tied Richard Petty for the most wins by a driver in a single season. Including the rain delays, there were a total of five caution periods during the race, with 68 laps being run under the yellow flag. Gordon's average speed was , and he received $164,450 for the victory. Gordon's career victory total stood at 42 after the race; at the time, he was the youngest driver to pass 40 career wins, and the youngest to win a third series title.

Fortunato Brescia and his wife Mrs. Mar√≠a Catalina Cafferata are the group founders. Their last names Brescia and Cafferata gave rise to the Breca brand, which collects the memory of its founders. Since September 2011, its main companies are grouped in Inversiones Breca S. A. holding company, which has as shareholders Ana Mar√≠a Brescia Cafferata, RBCF Inversiones, Pedro Brescia Moreyra, Mario Brescia Moreyra, Fortunato Brescia Moreyra and a RBCF trust. The Fort Brescia family is a shareholder in RBCF company.http://www.gatoencerrado.net/store/noticias/62/62510/detalle.htm Inversiones Breca SA ==History== Fortunato Brescia Tassano began his working life as an assistant to a retail store. In 1913 he acquired the Miranaves ranch, next to the Port of Callao, and began his own business to produce subsistence farming and dairy products and to become the supplier of the warehouses. A couple of years later, he bought the Limatambo ranch, which includes part of the current districts of San Borja, San Isidro and Miraflores. In 1919 Mr. Fortunato married Mar√≠a Cafferata Pe√±aranda and gave rise to a family decided to invest in Peru. In 1928 the Government of Augusto B. Legu√≠a expropriated part of the Miranaves ranch to build warehouses and residences for workers of the Port of Callao. In 1940 during the Government of Manuel Prado Ugarteche, it was also expropriated part of the Limatambo ranch to build an airport in Lima. In 1946 despite the expropriation, the opportunities in the real estate market led to Mr. Fortunato to create the company Urbanizadora Jard√≠n. In 1948 Mr. Fortunato developed his first real estate project: The Santa Marina residential area, in Callao. In 1952 Mr. Fortunato passed away and his sons Pedro and Mario were left in charge of the businesses with the support and cIn ontinued involvement of their sisters Rosa and Ana Mar√≠a. In the following years, the brothers consolidated the process of growth and diversification of the group, by venturing into industries such as banking, fishing, insurance, health and mining. Currently, the group is led by its co-chairmen, Alex Fort Brescia and Pedro Brescia Moreyra, and its directors, Rosa Brescia Cafferata, Ana Maria Brescia Cafferata, Fortunato Brescia Moreyra and Mario Brescia Moreyra. ==Development and diversification== Pedro Brescia assumed control of the group when he was 31 years old, and Mario became his right arm when he turned 23 years old. Their sisters Ana Mar√≠a and Rosa were, at that time, 27 and 25 years, respectively, and although they were considered in the big decisions (by Pedro's mandate, everything was decided by consensus), they never got involved in the day to day business. Pedro and Mario decided to give strength to the real estate business, which is reflected in the title of the thesis made by Pedro: ‚ÄúHow to lot a ranch for residential use?\\" This was focused on the lotting of the San Borja ranch. Despite of the push made in the real estate business, the brothers sought new opportunities and investment. They were admitted in the fishing business by acquiring the companies Tecnol√≥gica de Alimentos, Costa Mar and Indo Mar. In addition, their diversification led them to develop the mining business, so they took advantage of the quarries they inherited from their maternal grandfather, but his father Mr. Fortunato decided to close. They decided to reopen them, acquiring some new ones and creating Corporaci√≥n Minera Patar√°. In 1963, Pedro launched the San Borja residential area on part of the grounds of his ranch, and shortly after it would follow the Monterrico residential area. Both are today residential areas of modern Lima. In 1964, AESA was created, the first firm that would be in charge of the group's businesses, and the next year it entered into the R√≠mac shareholding, an important leap in its plan to diversify the group and learn from other entrepreneurs. When everything seemed to be going well, the political power touched the group business. In 1968, the Military Government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado passed the Agrarian Reform Law that snatched their agricultural lands in the valleys of Supe, Huaura, Chincha, and the urban land expansion territories in the basins of the Surco and Ate rivers. However, their lands in south Limatambo, Valverde and Naranjal were not touched. In 1973, the Government decided, in addition, to nationalize the fishing activity and took control of Tecnol√≥gica de Alimentos, which by that time already had a share of 4% of the fishing activity in Peru. This nationalization policy of the economy, although it meant financial loss for the nascent Brescia group, it also opened the door to new opportunities, since the Government had ordered that the industry, mining, banking and insurance, traditionally dominated by foreign capital, must necessarily have local partners. The foreign capital, on the other hand, could not have more than 20% of the shareholding in the companies dedicated to those sectors. In this position, when foreign investors were forced to reduce their participation, the Brescia group acquired 4% of the Banco de Cr√©dito del Per√∫ company and 27% of the Banco de Lima company. In 1977, they would perform a similar operation and achieved a major participation in the Minsur mining company. In parallel, they dabbled in the tourism sector when acquiring the hotels manager Intursa company. By the end of the seventies decade, the Brescia group acquired the Compa√±√≠a Peruana de Pinturas (CPP) and the fabric factory La Uni√≥n. ==Present== After the death of the founder Fortunato Brescia Tassano, in 1952, the leadership of the group was in the hands of his eldest son, Pedro Brescia Cafferata, with the support of his brother Mario. The two daughters of the patriarch, Rosa and Ana Mar√≠a, although with a much lower profile, also participated in making decisions. Pedro and Mario took the reins until they reached old ages and after their retirement (Mario passed away in 2013 and Pedro, who had retired a few years earlier, in 2014), the management was left in the hands of the third generation of the family. Although the family tradition dictated that Pedro leaves the management to his eldest son, he had no offspring, so a process of transfer and development of family protocols began. Consequently, the current management of the group is in charge of a steering committee made up of four members of the third generation, who act by consensus and maintain the tradition of the founders.\\" One of its subsidiaries, Tecnologica de Alimentos (TASA), is \\"one of the largest producers of fish meal in the world.\\" == Relevant companies ==  BBVA Per√∫  BBVA Continental is the second largest bank in Peru, with a network of 320 branches in the country.

Persons caught with 56 grammes (two ounces) or less of the drug will not be subject to incarceration. Instead, they will be fined a maximum of $500 and be subject to other measures including begin given educational material about cannabis; counselling and rehabilitative care. These provisions were among several amendments that were made to the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Amendment Act (2018), which was passed in Parliament on July 25. In addition to only being a ticketable offense, the amendment provides for Vincentians to smoke the herb in the privacy of their homes and in places of worship of the Rastafarian faith without punishment. The amendment also said that the Minister may designate a list of public areas where the smoking of cannabis may be allowed. The country has correlating legal medical marijuana laws. Parliament on December 11, 2018 passed two Acts, one which establishes a Medical Cannabis Industry in St Vincent and the Grenadines and the other which offers amnesty for traditional marijuana growers. The Vincentian Parliament passed legislation to protect the intellectual property of breeders of new plant varieties in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), the Plant Breeders‚Äô Protection Bill, 2019. It sets up the jurisprudential framework within which these persons will be able to accrue the rights, how these rights will be protected, how they will be published so that persons in the entire society, in the court and globally, can be aware of the hard work which was done, the agriculture minister said. Under the law, a person must obtain the authorization of a grantee with respect to propagating material of the protected variety, to produce or reproduce, condition the material for the purpose of propagation, offer the material for sale, to sell the material, import or export the material, or stock the material for any of the previous purposes. Regarding infringement of plant breeders‚Äô rights, the following acts are exempt: an act done privately for non-commercial purposes, an act done for experimental purposes, or an act done for the purpose of breeding other plant varieties. The law allows for compulsory licenses where a person may apply to the court for the grant of a compulsory license to exploit a protected variety in SVG. Subject to terms that the court thinks fit, the court may make an order for the grant of compulsory licenses if it is satisfied that the grant of the compulsory licenses is in the public interest. Offense under the law include falsification of register and falsely representing a plant variety as a protected variety.

Cannabis is widely grown illicitly on the island and is the nation's most valuable agricultural product. Saint Vincent is the most prolific producer of cannabis in the Caribbean, other than Jamaica. ==History== Commercial cultivation of cannabis in SVG began in the 1970s; the island's inaccessible hilly volcanic interior, rich soil, and wide array of often empty islands proved to make it an excellent place to cultivate and traffic cannabis. Prior to the 1970s, most cannabis in SVG was the product of Colombia or Trinidad. A large portion of the cultivators were youth who had previously worked on banana farms, until price downturns led to a collapse of the banana industry. In the 1980s, the United States greatly increased cannabis interdiction in the Caribbean, which led to the unintended consequence of stimulating domestic cannabis cultivation in the United States. By the 1990s, SVG's advantage in the regional cannabis market had faded, but with supply still steady, they began increased exports to neighboring island nations. Cannabis had become the island's major cash- crop, and cannabis cultivators grouped themselves into alliances mirrored after the familiar Banana Growers' Association. By the year 2000, the cannabis crop was estimated (even after 10% eradication) at US$40 million, outpacing even bananas. ==Economy== In 2010, SVG's cannabis production was assessed: *50% Caribbean market *15% United States *23% UK and Europe *10% Canada *2% local consumption ==References== Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Category:Drugs in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ","title":"Cannabis in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"},{"id":"56130049","text":"Mo Wuping (, born 5 September 1958, Hengyang, Hunan, died 2 June 1993, Beijing) was a Chinese contemporary classical composer.

The campus was founded in 2014, and courses began in the Fall of 2017. ==History== Prior to its establishment, regional administrators and politicians had been working to establish a 4-year university in Snohomish County for 23 years. Since 1941, the primary source of higher education in the county was Everett Community College, serving over 19,000 students annually. Washington State University's expansion into Everett aimed to train engineers for the local aerospace and high-tech industries, particularly in Snohomish, Island and Skagit counties. The campus officially opened in June 2017, with students beginning coursework in Fall 2017 Semester. WSU Everett recorded 222 enrolled undergraduate students for its Fall 2017 Semester, a 17.5% jump from the 189 enrolled the year prior. There is a 91.1 percent graduation rate. ==Campus== The main building is a 4 storey, 95,000-square-foot structure, which cost 64.6 million to build. The building includes a roof with 80 kilowatt photovoltaic solar panels. The land is owned by Everett Community College. The campus does not possess its own independent library and currently shares many of its resources with the neighboring Everett Community College. Everett Community College owns the land. ==Student life== Opportunities for civic engagement by students include a local branch of the Associated Students of Washington State University (ASWSU), which works as an elected student government, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers for undergraduates involved in computer electrical design, and the non-profit organization Society of Women Engineers.

It was designed by George Ledwell Taylor, Civil Architect to the Navy Board and named after the then Duke of Clarence (later William IV, King of England). The new victualling yard was developed on approximately 20 hectares of land, some of which was already in use as a brewing establishment at Weevil on the west shore of Portsmouth Harbour, to the north of Gosport. Queen Victoria regularly used Royal Clarence Yard as her disembarkation point for the short journey across the Solent to her house at Osborne in the Isle of Wight, travelling from Gosport Station on the single track line extension which had been opened in 1844 principally for this purpose. Between the establishment of the Yard and its eventual decommissioning in the early 1990s, Royal Clarence Yard supplied provisions to the Royal Navy in all the major conflicts of this period. In 1995, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) declared 16.26 hectares of Royal Clarence Yard surplus to requirements and released it to Gosport Borough Council. Berkeley Homes bid for the land in 1998 and was granted planning permission for a mixed use development in 2001. The south-eastern part of the Yard (approx 3,74 hectares), which includes the Oil and Pipelines Agency access to the Gosport Oil Fuel Depot, was retained by the MoD for operational reasons. In 2014, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation announced plans to release most of the rest of the retained land at Royal Clarence Yard to Gosport Borough Council. == History of the Victualling Yard == Records dating from the early 17th Century show the area named as \\"Weevel Wel Spring\\". Later records indicate that the land had once been a farm belonging to someone named \\"Weovill\\". In the late 17th Century, a local brewer, \\"Captain\\" Henry Player, founded a brewery on the site and started supplying beer to the Royal Navy. In 1704, he built a manor house (known as Weevil House) on the site, together with gardens, a Master Brewer's house and other ancillary buildings. Henry Player died in 1711 but the brewery continued to be managed by members of his family until 1751. Purchase of the Weevil Yard Cooperage pump house, dating from 1778; now housing a caf√©, it originally contained a horse pump. In that year, the Weevil brewery was purchased by the Victualling Commissioners with a view to consolidating their brewing operations in Portsmouth on to a single site. The complex was soon extended: the start of the Seven Years' War prompted the Commissioners to build an additional brewhouse in 1756 to meet increased demand; and in 1766 a much larger cooperage was built (four ranges of buildings in an irregular quadrangle; these are still in place, the oldest surviving buildings in any of the victualling yards). When Henry Player's daughter, who had continued to live in Weevil House, died in 1758, the house (together with the rest of the Weevil estate) was purchased by the Commissioners. (No new buyer could be found for the house and it was demolished in 1772). In In 1780, the decision was taken to replace Player's original 'Great Brewhouse' with a new brewery, to be built alongside the east range of the cooperage. Construction duly took place in 1781-2 to designs by Samuel Wyatt, with Samuel Whitbread acting as a consultant on improving the brewing process. Alongside his new brewery, Wyatt built a long storehouse for storing beer in barrels (along with the dry goods used in the brewing process). Wyatt's brewery remained operational into the 19th century: in 1831 the daily shipboard issue of beer ended (to be replaced by the rum ration), but brewing still continued (albeit on a much smaller scale) until the 1850s. Problems with the water supply to the brewery had led to John Smeaton being brought in to advise on this and on other engineering works across the Yard. In 1780 a new brewery pumphouse was installed to his design. A second pump was installed, to the same design, in 1788, adjacent to Wyatt's new brewery; this pump, converted from horse power to steam in 1860, remained in service for many years, providing water (by way of a reservoir to the north) for various uses across the site. Rebuilding and renaming Taylor's former Granary (left) and Bakery (right). The challenge of victualling the fleet during the Napoleonic Wars led the Victualling Board to try to consolidate its various manufacturing, storage and distribution operations in Portsmouth on to a single site (as had already been achieved at the Board's principal Yard in Deptford). At the time, it was operating from various premises, mostly in and around Old Portsmouth; these included King's Mill by the Gunwharf (purchased in 1712), a slaughterhouse near the Square Tower, and a bakery and storehouse (established in 1513) on King's Street. All were on constrained sites with limited access. In 1824 the Victualling Board proposed transferring all these operations to the Weevil site; (they had made a similar recommendation two years earlier in respect of victualling arrangements at Plymouth, which had led to a site being adopted and adapted for the future Royal William Yard in Stonehouse). With regard to Gosport, however, the Admiralty initially resisted the idea; that it went ahead was largely thanks to its being championed by the Duke of Clarence (Lord High Admiral at the time). By 1828 George Ledwell Taylor was engaged as architect; he was already involved in modernising Wyatt's brewery which (along with the adjacent cooperage) was to remain in place and in use as part of the new complex. (Wyatt's long storehouse was also retained, but substantially extended). The most prominent new building on the site was a combined storehouse, granary, flour mill and bakery. Built to the north of the brewery complex, it consisted of two extended wings built either side of a central four-storey Granary (which projected out on to the edge of the quayside). The north wing was largely given over to the industrial Bakery and contained state-of-the-art machinery designed by pioneering food technologist Sir Thomas Grant. The north wing extended behind the Granary to accommodate the flour mill (where grain from the Granary was ground into flour for the Bakery); it was powered by a steam engine, located to the rear (the engine and the milling machinery were provided by Sir John Rennie). The south wing functioned as a large storehouse for (among other things) the principal product of the bakery: ship's biscuits. Behind the south wing, a large Salt Meat Store was built, where salted meat from the nearby slaughterhouse was stored in barrels ready to be loaded on to ships. The open area behind the north wing (known as the North Meadow) was used as a lairage for livestock; the surrounding sheds and stalls originally formed part of a barracks for Military Artificers (built in 1802, before the land was acquired by the Commissioners). Apart from the brewing, baking and butchering complexes, Taylor laid out a number of residential and administrative buildings around an open space just inside his new Main Gate (on Flagstaff Green, where Weevil House had once stood). These included a pair of large detached dwellings for the Superintendent and his deputy, smaller dwellings for other officials and, facing the gate across Flagstaff Green, the main office building topped by a small clock-tower.Vintage photograph On 1 July 1831 the complex was renamed the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard. By the end of 1832 work on the new Yard was all but complete. Several of its buildings have survived to the present day, as listed below. 19th-20th centuries The Yard remained in service for the next 160 years. After on-site brewing ceased, Wyatt's brewery was converted to serve as a clothing store, while the adjacent Storehouse became a rum and sugar store. Salted meat continued to be provided to ships into the 20th century, and the Bakery appears to have remained in operation until after the First World War (whereupon it too was converted into a storehouse). Most remarkably, the Cooperage continued producing barrels, using traditional methods, until the early 1970s. During the Second World War the Yard was kept very busy. It suffered during the Blitz with several buildings being damaged or destroyed by bombs, including the south wing of the Granary complex, the Salt Meat Store, the Main Offices, Wyatt's Brewery and the northern edge of the Cooperage. After the war new buildings were added and from 1961 the Navy's food laboratories were based there; they undertook innovative work on food production and preservation (e.g. freeze-drying). Large volumes of provisions continued to be stored in, and distributed from, the Yard until it (along with Plymouth's Royal William Yard) was closed in 1991. == Present day == 21st- century south wing (left) and 19th-century Granary (right) In the late 1990s the northern part of the site was acquired by Berkeley Homes. As part of its redevelopment in the early 2000s several new buildings were constructed, the old buildings refurbished and some destroyed buildings reinstated (most notably the missing south wing of the Granary complex). The project was awarded a commendation at the 2009 Royal Town Planning Institute Awards. The northern part of Royal Clarence Yard is now a mixed-use development open to the public including approximately 500 residential dwellings, workshops, artist galleries, cafes, restaurants, retail units and a marina (operated by Castle Marinas). The Ministry of Defence announced its intention to dispose of the southern part of Royal Clarence Yard in 2014 but this did not happen immediately. In June 2017, Gosport Borough Council included Royal Clarence Yard as a \\"Character Area\\" and proposals for its eventual development in a draft \\"Waterfront and Town Centre Supplementary Planning Document\\". In November 2018, the MoD put the site up for sale, emphasizing its 'full deep- water access to Portsmouth Harbour, making it ideally suitable for commercial marine activity'. The following year the site was purchased by the South Shields-based UK Docks, with a view to redeveloping it as 'a unique specialist marine hub'. == Notable Buildings == The Granary at Royal Clarence YardRoyal Clarence Yard was designated a Conservation Area by Gosport Borough Council in 1990. The site is significant due to its place in British industrial history as \\"one of the first large industrial food processing plants in the country\\" and for the quality and style of the buildings, several of which have Listed Building status.  Main Gate and Two Lodges  The ceremonial entrance to Royal Clarence Yard, designed by George Taylor and built in 1830-31, the Main Gate and flanking Lodges are built of brick, stuccoed on the interior front, in the late Georgian style. The gate and Lodges have Grade II* Listed Building status. The Arch is topped by a double-sided painted Coad Stone Royal Crest.  Superintendent's and Deputy Superintendent's Houses; Police House, Flagstaff Green  The Superintendent's and Deputy Superintendent's Houses at Royal Clarence YardAdjacent to the Main Gate sit the Superintendent's and Deputy Superintendent's Houses which were designed and built in stuccoed brick by George Taylor in 1830-31 to house the Victualling Yard senior officers. Both buildings have Grade II Listed Building status. The Police House (Residence 6) is a Grade II Listed Building designed and built by George Taylor at the same time as the Main Gate, the Lodges and the other officer's residences surrounding Flagstaff Green. Built of stuccoed brick in the late Georgian style, this building was formerly used as the residence of the Yard's Inspector of Police.  The Granary and Bakery; Flour Mill and Stores; Boiler and Engine House  The Bakery at Royal Clarence YardThe Granary and Bakery,Flour Mill, Stores (1828‚Äì30) and the Boiler and Engine Houses (1862-3) are all late Georgian style, red-brick buildings with Grade II* Listed Building status. The Bakery on the ground floor, which retains the original large bread ovens, has been converted into a restaurant.  The Slaughterhouse  The Slaughterhouse at Royal Clarence YardThe Slaughterhouse is an Italianate style, red-brick building with Grade II Listed Building status. It was built in 1854 following a decision to move the slaughtering facility from its former location close to the mooring for the Royal Yacht due to many complaints from the Royal Household about 'offensive effluvia' from the old slaughterhouse.  The Cooperage and the Pump House  The Cooperage consists of single story workshops set around a large square, most of which were constructed between 1765 and 1766 next to the Weevil Brewery. Originally used for the manufacture of casks, some of the workshops were later adapted for other uses as the needs of the Navy changed. The South, West and East Ranges are all Grade II Listed buildings. The last cooper to work at Royal Clarence Yard was Michael Whitaker, who joined as an apprentice aged 14 in 1949 and left when the Yard finally closed in 1990. The Pump House in the Cooperage is an octagonal Grade II Listed Building built in 1778 of brick with a pyramidal louvred roof. It was originally designed to house the horse engine which pumped water from the well beneath to the Weevil Brewhouse nearby.  The Tank Store and Steam Fire Engine House  The Tank Store is a long, Grade II Listed, 23 bay shed, originally built in 1833 with open sides. Timber- framed walls were added shortly after construction. The store's main purpose was the \\"care and maintenance of ships' water storage tanks\\" and is the only known surviving example of a purpose-built bulk tank storage unit. A continuous lean-to was added on the western side of the Store in 1870. The Engine House was added in 1892.  The New South Store  Lying parallel to the Tank Store, the New South Store is a long Grade II Listed Building, parts of which date from 1758. The building was altered in 1830 (George Taylor's development of the former brewery into the new Naval Victualling Yard), remodelled again in 1897-8 and damaged during a bombardment in 1940. The building was originally used to store dry goods for the brewery and later used for storing rum and sugar. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Hampshire Category:Royal Navy shore establishments Category:History of the Royal Navy ","title":"Royal Clarence Yard"},{"id":"56130076","text":"Robert Mackenzie Daniel (1813 ‚Äì 21 March 1847) was a Scottish journalist and novelist. ==Life== Daniel was a son of John Daniel, a merchant, and was baptized on 4 September 1813 in Peterhead, Scotland.

Ayaka writes from the perspective of a protagonist being moved by the realization of all the things she gains from putting an honest foot forward in life. ==Critical reception== The midtempo ballad is described as the perfect showcase for Kudo's voice. Ayaka was praised for crafting a dynamic melody with a subtle, but emotional, message.

The Constitution of the Principality of Serbia (Slavonic-Serbian: ) known as the Sretenje Constitution (Candlemas Constitution), was the first constitution of the Principality of Serbia, adopted in Kragujevac in 1835. The Constitution was written by Dimitrije Davidoviƒá. The Constitution divided the power into legislative, executive and judicial branches, which is still considered the standard of democracy and constitutionality today. The government consisted of the prince, the State Council and the National Assembly. The constitution stipulated that the prince and the State Council share the executive power. Citizens' rights and freedoms were protected, such as: the inviolability of personality, the independence of the judiciary and the right to a lawful trial, freedom of movement and settlement, the right to choose a profession, equality of citizens, regardless of religion and ethnicity. The Constitution abolished slavery and feudalism. Although enacted by the Grand National Assembly, the constitution was suspended after only 55 days under pressure from the Great Feudal Powers (Turkey, Russia and Austria). Today, the original copy of the document is kept in the National Archives of Serbia. == Background ==  War and autonomy  The Revolutionary War first began as a local uprising against the usurper of Dahija in 1804 after the assembly at Sretenje in Ora≈°ac, where ƒêorƒëe Petroviƒá Karaƒëorƒëe was elected as leader.During the First Serbian Uprising, three constitutional acts were drafted. The first in 1805, the second in 1808 and the last in 1811. The act written on December 14, 1808 represents the first written and formal act of independent organization of Serbia. This act formally abolishes Nahija and self-government and establishes a centralist system of administration. The period of mixed Serbian-Turkish administration, which lasted from 1815 to 1830, was marked by the gradual suppression of the Turkish authorities and the concentration of power in the hands of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. The Turkish authorities were represented by the Belgrade Pasha or Vizier, the Kadija and the Muselli, while the Serbian authorities were represented by the Supreme Prince of Serbia, the People's Office and others, and since 1820, special Serbian courts have been established. In October 1826, the Ottoman Empire pressured by the request of the new Russian emperor was forced to accept the conclusion of the so-called Akerman conventions. The fifth article of the Convention stipulated that the Porta would immediately enforce the provisions, the eighth item of the Bucharest Peace, concerning the Serbian people. Feeling the agitation of the masses of people , the prince promised significant legislative and administrative reforms at the February 1, 1834 Assembly. == Mileta's rebellion == The absence of the state system and the court in Serbia was very felt, the number of humiliated officials, who were beaten. They were not ready to suffer the behavior of Prince Milo≈° and his closest associates. In addition, Milo≈° still avoided organizing the Council, according to the 1830 constitution, but he was obliged to do that . Despite formally relieving the peasants of feudal relations, Prince Milo≈° still retained certain feudal obligations, which would almost cost him his reign a little later. Feeling the agitation of the masses of people , the prince promised significant legislative and administrative reforms at the February 1, 1834 Assembly.He also gave one draft constitution, and before it was drafted he appointed five ministers. He appointed Lazar Teodoroviƒá as Minister of Justice and Education, ƒêorƒëe Protiƒá as Minister of the Interior, Koca Markoviƒá as Minister of Finance, Toma Vuƒçiƒá Peri≈°iƒá as Minister of army and Minister of Foreign Affairs Dimitrije Davidoviƒá. However, he did not specify their duties by any decree. As Milo≈° continued to behave as before, his opponents believed that he will do something if a rebellion was clearly shown. This is how the plot against the prince began. At the beginning of January 1835, in Kru≈°evac, in the house of Stojan Simiƒá, an agreement was made between the oppositionists by Milosav Zdravkoviƒá Resavac, Mile Radojkoviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Protiƒá, Milutin Petroviƒá Era (brother of Hajduk Veljko) and Avram Petronijeviƒá. The collusion, which the opposition reached,entails filing a request to Prince Milo≈°, as well as violent means if he refuses the request. At the meeting, some suggested killing, others to overthrow and expel, however, the view of Mileta Radojkoviƒá prevailed, according to which the rebellion was named - Mileta's rebellion, to restrict the power of Prince Milo≈° by constitution, abolish the kulak, allow the people the right to the use of forest and, most importantly, for disenfranchised merchants, abolishes the monopoly on trade. When the time came for action, Simiƒá brought a few people from Kru≈°evac, while the others failed to gather anyone behind. Only Mileta Radojkoviƒá brought a large number of people from Jagodina to Kragujevac. When the revolutionaries arrived near Kragujevac, they were greeted by an assembled people to whom Petronijeviƒá gave a burning speech accusing Prince Milo≈° of acting as a pasha and imposing on the people his state as his heritage. The revolutionaries were met by Toma Vuƒçiƒá Peri≈°iƒá, who stood in defense of Prince Milo≈°, but left an army of 150 horsemen to take care of Captain Petar Tucakoviƒá, avoiding conflict until he knew the reasons for the rebellion. In the meantime, the rebels in Kragujevac suggested that Po≈æarevac might be attacked ( that is where Prince Milo≈° was located ), but Mileta still remained to limit the prince's authority. Vuƒçiƒá agreed to be the mediator and conveyed the news to the prince, who even thought of running away. Milo≈° decided, and most probably after Vuƒçiƒá's speech, to reach a final agreement with the leaders of the popular rebellion. Frightened by this rebellion, Prince Milo≈° decided to issue a constitution and establish a State Council after the meeting. He entrusted making of the constitution to Dimitrije Davidoviƒá, and convened the Assembly on February 2/February 14. 1835. == Passing a Constitution == The constitution was drafted by Dimitrije Davidoviƒá, modeled on the French constitution of 1791 and the constitutional charters of 1814 and 1830, and the Belgian constitution of 1831. He gave a brief outline of the U.S. Constitution in \\"Serbian Gazette\\" No. 15 of April 25, 1835. He coined a new term for the constitution that replaced the former on Serbian term \\"–∫–æ–Ω—à—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ü–∏—ò–∞\\". In a semi-independent principality, Davidoviƒá drafted the supreme legal act of a liberal organization in a very free-spirited manner, and the Constitution was divided into 14 chapters and 142 articles. The constitution divided power into legislative, executive and judicial branches. Legislative and executive power belonged to the prince and the Council of State, and the courts were independent courts. The executive power consisted of six ministers, and the Council President also chaired ministerial sessions.On February 2, 1835, according to the new calendar, on February 15, a Sretenje Constitution was passed in the prince's meadows in Kragujevac and with the presence of 2.5 thousand participants and 10 thousand of curious world, after which the prince was taken from the mass of the world in his hands , and while voting was previously conducted in districts without a main hearing. The next day, the constitution was read and published in a solemn manner, with flags and ceremonial music, the prince's cavalry and infantry guards, and with the presence of the state top and deputies. In the evening a fireworks show and a theater play were held. == The outcome of the Constitution == The Constitution was in force for only 14 days (55 days). The largest European empires of Russia, Turkey, Austria, Prussia, as well as many smaller countries, did not have Constitutions at the time, nor did they adopt them in due course. That is why all of them opposed and agreed that the constitution was revolutionary and against their feudal order. On April 11, 1835, the Constitution was repealed. == References == * * * Category:Constitutions of Serbia Category:Principality of Serbia Category:1830s in Serbia Constitution of Serbia Constitution of Serbia ","title":"Sretenje Constitution"},{"id":"56130203","text":"Make Millions is a business simulation game developed by Tom Snyder Productions and released for the Macintosh in 1984. ==Gameplay== As the box art tells you, \\"The fast paced business strategy game that dares you to face the challenge of building a successful conglomerate.

Following the conclusion of each match, the teams played each other in a List A fixture in the 2018‚Äì19 Quaid-e-Azam One Day Cup tournament. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited were the defending champions. In April 2018, Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL) won the Patron's Trophy Grade-II tournament to qualify for this years' edition of the competition. ZTBL won their opening fixture of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, against Lahore Blues, by 151 runs. Prior to the start of the tournament, two players were dropped by their teams. Ahmed Shehzad, captain of Habib Bank Limited (HBL), was left out of HBL's squad after testing positive for the use of a banned substance. Hasan Raza was not selected to play for Pakistan Television, after his alleged involvement in spot-fixing. During the tournament, the quality of some of the pitches was questioned. This included the fixture between Water and Power Development Authority and Sui Southern Gas Company, which was abandoned on day one due to an unsafe pitch, before it was restarted as a three-day game, and the fixture between Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited and Habib Bank Limited, which saw Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited being bowled out for just 35 runs in their first innings. In Pool A, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, Peshawar, Khan Research Laboratories and Habib Bank Limited all progressed to the Super Eight section of the tournament. They were joined by Sui Southern Gas Corporation, Water and Power Development Authority, Karachi Whites and Lahore Blues from Pool B. The Super Eight fixtures were originally scheduled to take place in Lahore. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) moved the matches to Karachi due to bad weather. Meanwhile, Islamabad from Pool A and Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited from Pool B were both relegated to the second-tier for the next season. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines and Habib Bank Limited won their respective Super Eight groups to progress to the final of the tournament. For the first time in several years, the final was not shown live on television.

Adaptive NK cells have been identified in both humans and mice. The term adaptive NK cells stems from their described immunological behaviour, which parallels functions of the adaptive immune system including dynamic expansions of defined subsets of cells and protective memory responses. Persistent memory-like NK populations have been reported during viral infection, contact hypersensitivity reactions, and after stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines or activating receptor pathways. Memory-like NK cells show a diversity of functional, phenotypic, epigenetic, and homeostatic differences from cytotoxic NK (cNK) cells that prove their classification as a separate subset from cNK cells. This so-called memory-like functionality is antigen-unspecific and characterized by an increased proliferative capacity, long-term persistence in vivo for up to 3 months, and high IFN-Œ≥ production and potent cytotoxic activity upon ex vivo restimulation. The spectrum of human NK cell diversity is wide due to the variety of the surface receptor, intracellular signaling molecule, expression of the transcription factor, foreign antigen exposure and tissue-specific imprinting. Besides the direct effects of cytokines on NK cell activation, pre-activation by IL- 12 and IL-18 plus IL-15 can contribute to the development of murine and human NK cells with long-lasting enhanced NK cell functionality even after termination and in the absence of the initial stimulus. Similar to cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells, CD16 pre-activated NK cells up-regulate CD25 expression particularly in the presence of IL-12, resulting in increased sensitivity to low-dose IL-2 and more vigorous proliferation and expansion in response to IL-2. == Origin == Human adaptive NK cells are likely to be derive from cNK cells in peripheral blood. In particular, CD56dim cNK cells can be a probable pool of progenitor cells for adaptive NK cells. The reason is that CD56dim cNK cells are more likely to express KIRs and/or CD94/NKG2C. These surface molecules in turn can transmit important antigen-sensing signals during infection. CD49a+NKG2C+ NK cells are the small populations of HCVM-associated human liver-resident NK cells. These cells differ from the predominant population of liver-derived CD49e‚àíCD49a‚àí NK cells and increase the possibility that the former constitute a unique tissue- resident adaptive NK cell population in humans. Signals transmitted through the IL-12 receptor combined with CD2 and MHC class I-binding receptor provide a three-prong stimulation responsible for promoting the epigenetic and phenotypic modifications that occur in association with adaptive NK cell differentiation. == Epigenetic regulation == NK cells essentially \\"remember\\" the previous effects of cytokines. NK cells pre-activated by IL-12/15/18 transfer their enchanced IFN-Œ≥ producing capacity to daughter cells. HCMV- associated NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells and IL-12/15/18 pre-activated NK cells have been detected to have an epigenetic imprint, for instance, the demethylated CNS1 region of the IFNG gene, which in turn can lead to a remarkable stability of the IFN-Œ≥-producing phenotype even after adoptive transfer. Both IL-12 and IL-18 are required for the pronounced demethylation of the CNS1 region, whereas IL-15 might serve as a survival factor. In addition to the IFNG gene, NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells also showed CpG demethylation of the PRDM1/BLIMP1 and ZBTB32/TZFP genes or hypermethylation of FCER1G (Fc fragment of IgE receptor Ig). Pre-activation of NK cells by the cytokines IL-12/18 plus IL-15 or by engagement of FcŒ≥RIII/CD16 via therapeutic antibodies can induce similar memory-like functions: an enhanced proliferative capacity toward IL-2 due to CD25 up-regulation as well as a strengthened responsiveness to restimulation by tumor cells. Importantly, both memory-like functionalities are antigen-unspecific and mean ‚Äúremembering‚Äù a previous state of increased activation caused by cytokine exposure or stimulation via activating NK cell receptors. == In humans == Unique and expanded adaptive NK cell populations were observed in peripheral blood in humans that have been previously infected with Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). These NK cells bear activating MHC class I-binding receptors, typically CD94/NKG2C, demonstrate reduced activation and degranulation in response to activated autologous T cells and they are CD56dim CD16+. In comparison to CD56dim cNK cells, adaptive NK cells generally show decreased expression of surface CD7, CD161, NKp30, NKp46, and SIGLEC-7 but demonstrate retained or even higher expression of CD2, CD57, and CD85j (ILT2, LILRB1). None of these surface marker expression patterns are inherently specific for adaptive NK cells, but together they may help to identify discrete populations of adaptive NK cells. Human adaptive NK cells have the hypomethylated region of IFN-Œ≥ promoter. After stimulation through CD16 ligation adaptive NK cells produce large amounts of IFN-Œ≥ and also extensively proliferate. The cytotoxicity of adaptive NK cells remains a constant question in this field. It had been indicated similar or redused degranulation of CD107a as compared to cNK cells after CD16 ligation or stimulation with antibody-coated tumor targets. == Therapeutic potential == The clinical application of NK cells with memory-like properties can significantly increase the efficiency of these cells and pave the way for the new NK cell-based clinical approaches for the cancer treatment. Adaptive NK cells can mediate the enhanced antitumor effects, that may be due to their increased cytotoxicity, high IFN-Œ≥ production capacity, and persistence in large numbers in the host. Clinical use of allogeneic NK cells is promising for the treatment of leukemia. KIR-ligand mismatch has a beneficial effect on the alloreactivity of donor NK cells against recipient leukemia. Besides, it has been shown that the adoptive transfer of alloreactive NK cells does not cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but instead suppresses GVHD. == See also == * Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor * KLRC2 * Adoptive cell transfer * CD56 * Human Cytomegalovirus * IFN-Œ≥ == References == Category:Lymphocytes Category:Human cells ","title":"Adaptive NK cells"},{"id":"56130563","text":"The Golden Square (–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –ö–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç; Zolotoi Kvadrat) is a town square located in the city center of Almaty, Kazakhstan.–û—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ê–ª–º–∞—Ç—ã \\"–ó–û–õ–û–¢–û–ô –ö–í–ê–î–†–ê–¢\\" It is considered a historical point in Almaty, and numerous prominent governmental buildings are currently located there.\\"–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç: –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ –≤–æ—Å—å–º–∏ –º–∏–ª–ª–∏–∞—Ä–¥–æ–≤ —Ç–µ–Ω–≥–µ –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–º–æ–Ω—Ç —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞ –ê–ª–º–∞—Ç—ãThe 10 Best Placesto Walk in Almaty The area was originally a prominent area for Almaty‚Äôs elite social classes, and numerous known poets, politicians, and musicians lived there.–ê–∫–∏–º –ê–ª–º–∞—Ç—ã –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–ª –ø–æ–¥ –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å —Å–Ω–æ—Å \\"–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–≥–æ –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç–∞\\" The architecture in the area includes Stalin-era houses with neo-Russian ornamentation and pastel-colored fronts.\\"–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç\\" –ê–ª–º–∞—Ç—ã: –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –ø—Ä–æ–≥—É–ª–∫–∏ The square is bordered by the streets Zheltoqsan, Bogenbai, Kunaeva, and Abaya.

Veins, mainly the great saphenous vein (GSV) are the most frequently used conduits in bypass surgeries (CABG or PABG), due to their ease of use and availability. Some structural changes of intima thickening and vein wall remodeling are necessary for vein graft adaptation to the arterial environment. The reasons why some of the grafts progress to clinical stenosis is unknown. The patency rates of saphenous vein grafts after CABG at 1 year is approximately 80%. After 5 years the patency rate drops to 65% and at 10 years GSV patency rates are approximately 50%, with only half of the veins are atherosclerosis free. VGF may be identified in asymptomatic patients, but can also produce symptoms of ischemia, depending on the area of the supplied territory of the heart, and the function of native arteries and other grafts. VGF has been closely correlated with revascularization, myocardial infarction and death. Treatment of occluded GSVs can be performed by percutaneous coronary intervention or redo CABG and is considered to be challenging, and thus preventing their obstruction is of great importance. ==Mechanism== During and after the harvesting, veins go through a period of ischemia and reperfusion after engraftment, which causes damage to endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMC). The grafting exposes the vein to arterial pressure and flow that causes increased shear stress and wall tension, which further damages the endothelial layer and SMC. The damage causes local release of tissue factors and reduced bioavailability of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO), all of which contribute to platelet activation, deposition of fibrin, which promotes thrombosis. Growth factors that released from macrophages and platelets lead to increased proliferation and migration of SMCs to the intima. The migrated SMC release extracellular matrix resulting in reduced intimal cellularity. Low levels of endothelial nitric oxide, adenosine and prostaglandins, further contribute to SMC proliferation. Over time continued SMC migration and proliferation cause extracellular matrix deposition and fibrotic change that lead to development of intimal hyperplasia, which results in luminal loss that makes the graft more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Progressive atherosclerosis is the primarily cause of late vein graft failure. Vein graft atherosclerotic lesions are more diffuse and concentric, yet less calcified, compared to native atherosclerotic lesions, and are more susceptible to thrombosis formation and rupture. ==Prevention== Statins and antiplatelets such as aspirin, are the only medications recommended by the ESC guidelines and the ACC/AHA Task Force guidelines for the prevention of VGF. Different surgical techniques had been studied in attempt to reduce VGF. The No-touch technique is where the vein is harvested with the surrounding tissues, keeping the vasa vasorum and the nerves in the adventitia intact. This technique shown to improve vein graft patency and less development of intimal hyperplasia. Despite the benefits shown, the use of No-touch technique in CABG is limited to a few centers. Probably because of the shift toward improved cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction provided by endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH). Although, EVH has been associated with higher risk of vein graft stenosis and occlusion. The solutions in which vein grafts are stored after harvesting also play an important role. Buffered saline, instead of saline or blood, has shown to reduce the risk of significant stenosis or occlusion. Providing the vein with external support prior to grafting has shown to reduce intimal hyperplasia formation and improve the hemodynamics within the graft. Gene therapy is another strategy that been suggested to prevent VGF as the veins are ideally suited for ex vivo treatment prior to grafting. Preclinical studies showed that such strategy has the potential to reduce intimal hyperplasia but more clinical data is needed. == References == Category:Veins Category:Surgery ","title":"Vein graft failure"},{"id":"56130578","text":"You Can Do Magic may refer to: *\\"You Can Do Magic\\" (song), a 1982 song by America *\\"You Can Do Magic\\", a 1973 song by Limmie & Family Cookin' *You Can Do Magic (album), a 1996 compilation album by America *You Can Do Magic, a television programme broadcast by CITV ","title":"You Can Do Magic"},{"id":"56130611","text":"Albert Cocksedge (30 January 1884 ‚Äì 25 January 1928), known in the early years of his career as Young Cocksedge, was a British boxer of the early 20th century, who held English titles at various weights, and fought for a world title, in the era before weights were standardised, fighting at weights between 98 and 112lbs. ==Career== Born in Leicester in 1884, Cocksedge won his first title in 1901, knocking out Young Tiddler in December that year to win the English 7-stone title. In October 1904 he fought a draw against Frank Morcombe for the latter's English 106lbs title, winning a rematch the following month to take the title. In December he was beaten by the Australian Tibby Watson, who would win the 108lbs world title the following month. In January 1905 he lost in a fight for the 7st 8lbs championship belt of the world to Johnny Hughes, a man who had also beaten him eight months earlier. In October 1906 he beat Charlie Dew on points to take the English 104lbs title, successfully defending against Dew two months later but losing it to Bert Chatterton in February 1907. He regained it in June that year, stopping Chatterton in the fourth round. In October 1907 he beat Charlie Exall for the 106lbs title, and in February 1908 beat Harry McDermott on points for the 108lbs title. In April 1908 he fought a draw with Sid Smith before successfully defending his 106lbs title two months later against Harry Badger. On 7 December 1908 he beat Jack Guyon on points at the National Sporting Club. In January 1909 he beat Smith and Watson, before losing his 108lbs title to Smith in February. He fought Smith again in March, also ending as loser. In September 1909 he fought a draw against Sam Kellar for the English 112lbs title. The two met again in October, with referee Tom Gamble stopping the fight in the fourth round, deciding neither man was trying. In April 1910 he beat McDermott on points over 20 rounds to take the English 110lbs title, losing it two months later to Bill Kyne. In October 1911 he challenged Bill Ladbury for the 112lbs title, Ladbury stopping him in the seventh round. Cocksedge continued to fight regularly until around 1914, and continued in both competitive and exhibition bouts, having possibly his final competitive fight in 1922 (beating Billy Shephard), and an exhibition against Jimmy Wilde a few years later. In his later years he was resident at 1, Paradise Lane in Leicester, and worked as a shoe scourer. Cocksedge was walking to a whist drive in Leicester on 25 January 1928, when he was knocked down and killed by an RAF car.

The brand is named after the Carpathian Mountains, a mountain range that stretches across Central Europe and Eastern Europe. ==History== Carpa»õi was launched in 1931 in the Kingdom of Romania, but production expanded significantly after the 1950s under the Communist regime, when this brand was produced in 6 factories (Timi»ôoara, Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe, T√¢rgu Jiu, R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat, Ia»ôi and Bucharest). Each factory produced the cigarette with significant individual variations of the original recipe, giving birth to different preferences of Carpa»õi smokers towards the producing factory. Throughout its production history, both filtered and unfiltered, king size (85 mm) and short (70 mm) cigarettes were available under this brand, in either a soft or hard package, typically 20 cigarettes per pack. Furthermore, between 1950 and 1990, Carpa»õi cigarettes were also available loose, typically sold by the dozen, in specialty tobacco stores. Only full strength cigarettes were ever produced, and the most popular model (and the only one produced until 2010) was the unfiltered, 70 mm variant in a soft, paper pack. Up until the discontinue of the brand in 2010, only a few thousands packs are produced each year, and mainly sold as a nostalgia item. It was one of the cheapest cigarettes available on the market, becoming a favorite amongst students, factory workers and in the military, at one point in the 1970s accounting for more than 60% of the total sales in Romania. However, ever since the introduction of foreign brands after the Romanian Revolution and subsequent privatization of the factory, market share of Carpa»õi cigarettes dropped to a mere 10%, and they were only sold on the internal market in Romania. The production of this brand was discontinued in March 2010, and the Sf√¢ntu-Gheorghe Tobacco Factory closed its doors on 21 December 2010, after 113 years of cigarette production. ==References== Category:Cigarette brands Category:Products introduced in 1931 Category:Discontinued products Category:Romanian brands ","title":"Carpa»õi (cigarette)"},{"id":"56130940","text":"Toyi Simklina (born 23 December 1968) is a Togolese athlete.

For example the county of Kusel operates its tourist industry under the slogan \\"Palatine Uplands - Kusel Musikantenland\\". Regional dishes are described with the prefix \\"Musikantenland\\", there is for example a Musikantenland Roast and Musikantenland Bratwurst. The Musikantenland Museum in Lichtenberg Castle near Kusel and the West Palatine Musikanten Museum in Mackenbach recall the history of West Palatinate's wandering musicians. Since 1984, the county of Kusel has awarded the Lichtenburg Musikantenland Prize in recognition of special achievements for those cultivating and developing the West Palatinate musical tradition. Elmar Wolf, also a Lichtenburg Prize winner, founded the publishing house EDITION Musikantenland, after leaving the EWOTON-Musikverlag music publishing company, as a token of his affection for the Kusel Musikantenland.

He is engaged in office work and hangs out in nightclubs. Soon radio operator Zina is sent from the Center. Shura and Zina fall in love with each other. M√ºller sends Iron Hans to deal with Schurenberg, but Shura manages to kill Hans. Bormann blackmails Shurenberg under the threat that he will tell everyone that he is a spy if Schurenberg does not agree to intimate relations with him. Shurenberg, realizing that he is on the verge of failure, is going to leave on a special channel to his homeland. At this point, the Gestapo seizes and tortures Zina. Shurenberg deceitfully signs the document for her transfer from Bormann and takes her away. They together attack Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, tie them up and take away their clothes. After changing clothes, they try to leave the Gestapo, but they are discovered. They run away and drive by car to the border. On the Soviet border, they understand that their homeland is not very happy to see them either, and now they are fleeing both from the Germans and from the Russians.

The three principle forms of Durga worshiped in Hinduism are Maha- Durga, Chandika and Aparajita. Of these, Chandika has two forms called Chandi who is of the combined power and form of Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati and of Chamunda who is an esoteric aspect of Chandi created by the goddess for killing demons Chanda and Munda. Maha Durga has three forms, Ugrachanda, Bhadrakali and Katyayanihttps://www.kamakotimandali.com/srividya/durgalist.htmlhttp://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1154&more;=1&c;=1&tb;=1&pb;=1. Bhadrakali Durga is also worshiped in the form of her nine epithets called Navadurga. The main Deity in this temple is Durga who is also called Mizhavil Bhagavathi in a separate Sanctum prohibited to public. Mizhavil Bhagavathi, exists as Chandi and Chamunda in this temple. Mizhavil Bhagavathi exhibits herself as Saraswati, also called Mridanga Shaileshwari in this temple Srikovil, with a predominant power of knowledge, giving blessings of skill (Siddhi) in arts and as Chamunda also called Porkali outside the main temple complex. Mizhavil Bhagavathi as Mridanga Shaileshwari, in this temple acts as the patron of music, arts and all kinds of knowledge. Mridanga Shaileshwari in the main temple sanctum sanctorum (Srikovil) can also be worshipped as Saraswati, Parvati Lakshmi or Chandi depending upon the need. The power of Saraswati, knowledge is said to be predominant here and she is the goddess of arts, especially music as per legend. The worship of this temple is said to be not complete unless one worship the secret Mizhavil Bhagavati in the secret sanctum. Mridanga shaileshwari is the family deity of Kottayam royal family. The legends of Pazhassi Raja is closely associated with this temple. The temple, which was under ruins for a long time, gained national prominence when Alexander Jacob, a retired DGP of Kerala Police revealed a fascinating story related to the temple. It is said that thieves tried to steal the temple idol 3 times and each time they failed to do so because of strange reasons. Each time the idol was stolen, the idol was returned to the temple by the thieves themselves because of strange paranormal activity. When Alexander Jacob reveled this story in a television interview, from that day onwards, thousands of devotees are visiting the temple everyday. The temple is administered by Mridanga Shaileswari Temple Trust, A National Trust, an autonomous body under the Government of India. == References External links== *Official site of Mridanga Saileswari Temple Category:Hindu temples in Kannur district Category:Devi temples in Kerala ","title":"Mridanga Saileswari Temple"},{"id":"56131175","text":"Peter T√°bori is a Hungarian-born British architect who trained in London and is best known for the housing schemes he designed at Camden under Sydney Cook in the 1960s and 1970s, especially Highgate New Town (1968‚Äì79). == Education and early career[edit source] == T√°bori was born in Hungary in 1940 and came to Britain in 1956, after being imprisoned for six months following the Russian invasion of 1956. In Britain he finished his schooling and worked for a year for the architect Cecil Epril (1897‚Äì1982) before starting his architecture training at Regent Street Polytechnic, London (1958). At the end of his first year T√°bori won a travel scholarship, which he used to travel in northern Italy, visiting Siena, Florence and Pisa. At the end of his second year at the suggestion of James Stirling he took a year's break and applied to fellow Hungarian Ern√∂ Goldfinger, where he worked for a year. T√°bori returned to Regent Street and then went back to Goldfinger for his official 'year out'. Goldfinger was to be a lasting influence on PT, not least his interest in pre- modernist buildings and form. T√°bori returned to Regent Street for fourth year (1963‚Äì64). Here his tutor was Richard Rogers, freshly returned from the U.S. ‚Äì the start of T√°bori‚Äôs interest in housing. T√°bori was inspired by Rogers' enthusiasm for mass production and, for his fifth year thesis, decided on a thesis exploring industrialized housing typologies. By this stage, Rogers had given up teaching, to concentrate on the Team 4 projects with Norman Foster at al; but informally he continued to mentor T√°bori and recommended he should incorporate some real sites and briefs. T√°bori contacted Hampstead (the forerunner of Camden) and was sent information on three sites, including Highgate New Town. But his thesis looked at vertical facades with hung balconies and, contrary to subsequent myth, was not the origin of his stepped- section design for Highgate New Town. The Italian-born Rogers encouraged T√°bori to draw on his experience from visiting Italy‚Äôs hill-towns, which featured terraces and external stairs as at Highgate New Towns. T√°bori was also influenced by Rogers‚Äô interest in environmental design, which became evident at Highgate New Town ‚Äì one of the first times that ‚Äòecological‚Äô principles were applied to council housing in Britain. == Later career[edit source] == The external examiner for T√°bori's fifth-year thesis was Denys Lasdun, who promptly offered T√°bori a position in his office. T√°bori stayed with Denys Lasdun & Partners for three years (1965‚Äì68), working on the University of East Anglia, including the terraced ziggurat-like halls of residence and spending five months on the details of the pre-cast concrete with engineers Ove Arup ‚Äì an experience that he would put to good use at Highgate New Town. While still working for Denys Lasdun, in the autumn of 1967 T√°bori was invited by Camden‚Äôs borough architect Sydney Cook to attend for an informal interview. For T√°bori the primary attraction of Camden was Neave Brown, whose radical low-rise design for Fleet Road (Dunboyne Road) accompanied by the text, ‚ÄòThe form of housing‚Äô, had just been published in Architectural Design magazine.[1] Highgate New Town is the best known of Tabori‚Äôs Camden housing schemes and at the time was widely published in the UK, as well as France and Japan. But it was not the only one. At the same time as designing Highgate New Town, Tabori was asked by Cook to produce a design for another site, in Polygon Road, close to St Pancras Station. The design for this (now known as Oakshott Court) was closely related to Highgate New Town but with the terraced blocks in a L-shape formation. Due to pressure of work, delivery of the scheme was given to outside architects (first Roman Halter and then James Gowan), who made a number of changes (including red brick facing instead of concrete) without affecting the fundamentals of the design. The scheme was published extensively in the UK and also in Japan.[2] While Highgate New Town was under construction, T√°bori designed a third housing scheme, for a corner site at the junction of Mill Lane and Solent Road, which was eventually completed in 1981. While a much smaller scheme than the other two, it belonged to the same family, with a stepped section and striking external staircases cascading down the fa√ßade.[3] Apart from these, T√°bori‚Äôs work at Camden included the redevelopment of railway lands, which constituted a large proportion of the potential sites in the borough. In 1974-75 he worked with the engineers Ove Arup on a borough-wide land-use and planning study, ‚ÄòThe Adaptability of Railway Land in Camden‚Äô, looking at the feasibility of decking over railway lines at various locations for housing and other uses. He then produced (to detailed design stage) a scheme for decking over South Hampstead station, including 400 dwellings, shops and a sports centre (1975-77) and another for Hampstead Heath station (900 dwellings) (1977‚Äì79). Following serious injuries sustained in a car accident and other major health issues, T√°bori was eventually forced by ill health to leave Camden in the 1980s and focused on private work. Recently, with the revival of interest in the low-rise high-density format developed at Camden, Highgate New Town has received renewed attention. Not only in Swenarton 2017, which documented T√°bori‚Äôs work for the first time, but also subsequently in D Levitt and J McCafferty, The Housing Design Handbook (Routledge 2019) and M Althorpe and A Batchelor, Revolutionary Low Rise (Karakusevic Carson Architects 2019).[4][5] ==References== 1\\\\.

Its main musical influences are the notorious Tango of Buenos Aires and the Electronic music sounds of Berlin. == Background == Travels to Buenos Aires in 2005 sparked the initial inspiration for the creation of the project. Over the span of the next five years, many international artists in Berlin and Buenos Aires were recorded to eventually finalise the 14 tracks for the debut album carrying the same name as the project: Tangowerk. Besides electro and tango themes, audio aesthetics based on the Golden Twenties took strong musical influence. The album was mostly recorded in the famous Estudios ION in Buenos Aires where artists such as Astor Piazzolla or Osvaldo Pugliese had been recording. Back in Berlin, modular synthesizer, analog grammophones, radios and reel-to-reel tape recorders as well as state of the art technical post processing applications were implemented to create the unique, intermodal, amalgamated soundscape. Featured Argentinian vocalists include Tango icon Adriana Varela, singer Walter \\"Chino\\" Laborde and Karina Beorlegui as well as rapper El Topo. They were joined by Berlin-based singer Mieze Katz, Ina Viola and Lulu Schmidt, as well as Australian performance artist Headvoice and Crooner Louie Austen from Vienna. Collaboration with the Berlin Comedian Harmonists further impressed the musical touch of the 1920s.

MCP traced its roots to splinter groups amongst communist guerrillas in southern Thailand in the 1970s. The party conducted armed struggle in the Malaysian-Thai border areas between 1983 and 1987. It eventually accepted a deal for cessation of hostilities with the Thai military and its cadres were resettled in 'friendship villages'. ==Foundation== The party was formed on 5 December 1983 through the merger of two Communist Party of Malaya splinter groups; the Communist Party of Malaya/Revolutionary Faction and the Communist Party of Malaya/Marxist-Leninist. The two key leaders of MCP were Ah Leng (General Secretary of the party, hailing from CPM/ML) and Huang Chen (former CPM/RF leader). MCP traced its roots to a crisis in the CPM in the Thai-Malaysian border regions following a 1968-1970 internal purge. Up to 200 cadres were estimated to have killed in the purge, resulting in two out of four guerrilla camps of the Malayan National Liberation Army in the area rebelling against the CPM leadership. In 1970 the Sadao Camp of the 8th MNLA regiment broke away, forming CPM/RF. Later the second district of the 12th MNLA regiment, based at the Betong West Camp, broke away and formed CPM/ML. Both CPM/RF and CPM/ML repeatedly denounced the CPM leader Chin Peng as counter-revolutionary. MCP called on CPM members to join the new party. The merger of CPM/RF and CPM/ML had been preceded by failed reconciliation talks in Beijing between the CPM and the break-away groups. ==Political line== MCP sought to apply Marxism- Leninism to Malaysian conditions. Both of the founding factions of MCP had rejected the application of the Maoist line of encircling the cities from the country-side in Malaysian context, as the peasantry was predominately Malay whilst communist cadres were predominately Chinese. MCP sought to gain support from both Chinese urban workers as well as Malay peasants. MCP called for the building of a people's democratic United Front to defeat 'the reactionary Kuala Lumpur regime'. The party argued that \\"[t]he reactionary Kuala Lumpur regime is using various means to implement its suppressive, discriminatory, and divide-and-rule policy and is deliberately pitting various groups against one another and destroying the harmony among these groups. Furthermore, they are colluding more actively with foreign monopolistic and capitalistic groups and developing through various means bureaucratic, monopolistic capitalists, accelerating the new economic policy, and crazily confiscating and selling the country's natural resources.\\" After the founding of the party the adoption of a new party constitution and a party programme for New Democratic Revolution were announced. The latter document, adopted at the first sitting of the MCP Central Committee on 5 December 1983 contained ten points; including the 'overthrow the reactionary regime, bureaucratic capitalists, feudalism and imperialism', establishment of a People's Republic of Malaysia, abolishing 'all reactionary laws', respect of religious freedom, confiscating companies under foreign monopoly capital and bureaucratic monopoly capital, seize lands occupied by big landlords (but not lands owned by wealthy farmers, tani kaya), redistributing already nationalised lands to landless peasants, eradicate forced labour, equality of all nationalities of Malaysia, oppose imperialism and neo-colonialism, upholding proletarian internationalism. Moreover, whilst CPM insisted on organising in both in the (Malaysian part of) Malaya and Singapore, MCP acknowledged the Malaysian statehood and the political separation between Malaysia and Singapore. ==Organisation and auxiliary bodies== MCP was estimated to have around 800 fighters, according to Thai military sourced quoted in the Bangkok Post the MCP merger brought together some 500 guerrilla fighters from CPM/ML and some 300 guerrilla fighters from the CPM/RF (whilst the original CPM was estimated to have between 800 and 1,300 fighters at the time). MCP had an armed wing, the Malaysian People's Liberation Army (MPLA). It had a front organisation, named the Malaysian People's Liberation League (previously known as the Malayan People's Liberation Union, the erstwhile front organisation of CPM/ML). It ran a clandestine radio broadcast from southern Thailand, named the 'Voice of the People of Malaysia' (previously the 'Voice of the People of Malaya', new name announced 11 December 1983). The Voice of the People of Malaysia was broadcast in Malay, Standard Chinese, Cantonese and Tamil. ==Thai offensive against MPLA== With the establishment of diplomatic relations between Thailand and the People's Republic of China in 1976 and the cessation of Chinese logistic support for the Communist Party of Thailand in 1981, the Thai authorities were emboldened to confront the communist armed forces in the country. A joint military-civilian campaign against the MCP was launched, modelled after a similar campaign against Thai communist insurgents in north-eastern Thailand. In particular the Second MPLA Military District was affected by the Thai campaign. On 28 December 1983, the Thai military announced a joint Malaysian- Thai offensive in the border areas.New York Times. AROUND THE WORLD; Thailand and Malaysia Attack Border Rebels In 1984 and 1985 Thai authorities sent out peace feelers to MCP. ==Surrender== On 14 April 1987, the Voice of the People of Malaysia announced an agreement between the MPLA and the Thai authorities, whereby MPLA would cease its armed struggle whilst the Thai authorities would respect the 'dignity of [the MPLA] members'. As per the announcement, on 27 and 28 April 1987 some 700 MPLA guerrillas were expected to surrender to the Fourth Army Region of the Royal Thai Army. On 26 April 1987, Voice of the People of Malaysia announced that the radio broadcasts would cease the following day. Notably the agreement to cease hostilities was done between the two military forces (Second Military District of the MPLA and the Fourth Army Region of the Royal Thai Army respectively), rather than on political level. In doing so the Thai government avoided the issue of having accorded legitimacy to a communist insurgent force from a neighbouring country. In exchange for cessation of hostilities MPLA guerrillas were settled in 'friendship villages' in southern Thailand and were given guarantees against deportation to Malaysia. On 28 April 1987, some 542 MPLA guerrillas (537 according to another account) emerged from the jungle. 252 of the guerrillas who surrendered were women. They surrendered their equipments to the Thai forces. A reconciliation ceremony was held outside of Betong, presided over by the Commander of the Fourth Army Region Lt.-Gen. Visith Artkhumwong and attended by Thai military and civilian officials. The former MCP/MPLA guerrillas were resettled five peace villages; four along the road between Betong and Yala and one in Sadao. ==References== Category:1983 establishments in Malaysia Category:1987 disestablishments in Malaysia Category:Communist parties in Malaysia Category:Defunct political parties in Malaysia Category:Political parties disestablished in 1987 Category:Political parties established in 1983 ","title":"Malaysian Communist Party"},{"id":"56131723","text":"Jorge da Silva (born 4 January 1966) is a Brazilian athlete.

The church is located on the northern side of the Place de la Vaillance/Dapperheidsplein, not far from Erasmus House, the Old Beguinage of Anderlecht and the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. This site is served by Saint Guidon/Sint Guido metro station on line 5 of the Brussels metro. ==History== The Gothic building that we know today was erected in stages from 1350 to 1527. Jan van Ruysbroeck, the architect of the tower of Brussels' Town Hall, was responsible for the works between 1479 and 1485. The square tower dates from 1517. In the crypt beneath the church lies a very old tombstone with no inscription. A long tradition of pilgrimages consider it to be the tomb of Saint Guy, the \\"Poor Man of Anderlecht\\", who died around 1012. The following centuries, the tomb of Saint Guy began to attract a large number of pilgrims. Restoration works were carried out between 1843 and 1847, under the direction of the architect Jules-Jacques Van Ysendyck, which lead to the discovery of several wall paintings. In 1898, the square tower was surmounted with a spire, giving the church its current appearance.

He died of a heart attack in 1964. ==Background== Rae Johnstone was born to Robert James Johnstone (a coalminer) and Elizabeth Johnstone (nee Harvey) in 1905 in New Lambton, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales. In later life he was somewhat evasive when talking about his origins, claiming that his original surname was Davies and on others that he was of Portuguese descent. There is some evidence, however, that he may have attempted to conceal the fact that he was of Australian Aborigine heritage. Early in his riding career he was nicknamed \\"Togo\\" after Admiral Togo on account of his dark complexion and \\"oriental\\" appearance: Johnstone reportedly found the name offensive. ==Riding career== Johnstone began his riding career in Australia, winning his first race in 1920 at the age of 15. He had several brushes with the racing authorities and received a two-year ban in 1927 after he \\"conspired to lose a race\\". In 1931 he was the Champion Jockey in Sydney and began to attract attention from abroad. By that time he had won more than 600 races in Australia and also ridden successfully in India. In the following year he travelled to France to take up a position as the retained jockey for Pierre Wertheimer and moved to England two years later to ride for Lord Glanely. He made an immediate impact by winning the 2000 Guineas aboard Colombo but was criticised for his tactics when finishing third on the same colt in the Epsom Derby and returned to France shortly afterwards. In the following year he partnered the French-trained filly Mesa to win the 1000 Guineas. In his early career Johnstone had been known to bet of his mounts, but gave up gambling on his second marriage in 1940. During the Second World War Johnstone was rejected for military service and briefly went back to India, before resuming his riding career in France. In 1942 he was interned by the occupying forces but returned to race-riding in late 1944. In 1945 he won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on Nikellora. In the immediate post-war period Johnstone had great success riding French-trained horses in major British races. Between 1947 and 1956 he won the 1000 Guineas on Imprudence and Camaree, the Derby on My Love, Galcador and Lavandin, the Epsom Oaks on Imprudence, Asmena and Sun Cap and the St Leger on Scratch and Talma. In France he won a second Arc de Triomphe on Sica Boy in 1954. Arguably the best horse he rode however was Sayani on whom he won the Cambridgeshire Handicap in 1946. Johntone regarded his Derby win on My Love as his greatest achievement. He rode in the United States but did not enjoy the experience, commenting \\"There's no atmosphere. As far as I can make out, people go to races in America to eat sandwiches and hot dogs and to bet on a number\\". ==Riding style== Johntone was known for his judgment of pace and mastery of waiting tactics. He acquired the nickname \\"The Crocodile\\" because \\"he comes from behind and eats you up\\". He was also reluctant to use the whip on horses who were already beaten, which led to accusations of a lack of effort. He defended himself by saying \\"If the owner wants me to place, I‚Äôll try. But I don't like to ride a horse into the ground for nothing\\". ==Later life== Johnstone retired from riding to become a trainer. He died in Paris on 29 April 1964 after suffering a heart attack at Le Tremblay racecourse. ==Personal life== Johnstone was married twice. In June 1925 he married Ruby Isabel Hornery-Ford but their partnership was short-lived. In 1940 he married Marie Marcelle Augustine Goub√©, a former dancer at the Folies Bergere. His second marriage lasted until his death although he also carried on a long-term relationship with a mistress, Margo Winnick. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Australian jockeys Category:People from Newcastle, New South Wales ","title":"Rae Johnstone"},{"id":"56131870","text":"Banarus Muhammad Khan (born 31 August 1969) is a Pakistani athlete.

He was born in Congress Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. He attended religious and middle school in Lodz. In 1918/1919, he moved to Germany, and worked in a factory in Herne. In 1924, Pisarek left Germany to travel to Mandatory Palestine as Khalutz (Pioneer) and worked there as a stonemason. == Career == Four years later he returned to Germany after a short stay in France and settled in Berlin-Reinickendorf. There he completed a photographic education and worked as a photographer for image publishers and the Berlin theater community. His photos were published in Arbeiter- Illustrierte-Zeitung and in the Jewish press. In 1929, he joined the Reich Association of German Press. Pisarek's contacts with the KPD resulted in a collaboration with John Heartfield. He became a member of the Photography Group Berlin-Nord. As a friend of Max Liebermann, he frequented circles of artists and writers of the Weimar Republic. Pisarek was officially banned from working in the mainstream press after the seizure of power by the National Socialists in 1933. He was thereafter allowed to work only for the Jewish community. In 1936, he, his non-Jewish wife Gerda and their two children Georg and Ruth were expelled from their Reinickendorf apartment. They moved to Oranienburger Stra√üe in Berlin-Mitte. He worked as a photographer until 1941 for Jewish newspapers as well as for the Jewish Cultural Association of Berlin (where he photographed, among others, the pianist Grete Sultan). During this time, among other things, he took the only photos of Liebermann's funeral. In addition, he participated in (illegal) anti-fascist work, which led to repeated arrests and summonses to the Gestapo. After the final dissolution of all Jewish organizations in Germany in 1941, Pisarek was unemployed. He was drafted for forced labor and was inter alia used as an interpreter for Polish and Soviet forced laborers. An emigration to the United States failed. He survived the Nazi rule thanks to the Rosenstra√üe protest. In May 1944, his apartment burned down.  Postwar  Photo of the unification congress of the SED taken by Pisarek After the war, he worked as an interpreter for the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. He resumed his activities as a reporter and in this way documented the \\"anti-fascist-democratic revolution\\" in the Soviet occupation zone and the founding of the (communist) German Democratic Republic (GDR). The photo series of the handshake of Otto Grotewohl and Wilhelm Pieck at the foundation congress of the SED, in which the SPD and KPD parties merged to form the SED, is one of his most famous works. Numerous artist portraits, for example, those of Helene Weigel, Thomas Mann and Hanns Eisler, were created during this time. At the end of the 1950s, Pisarek turned almost exclusively to theater photography. Avraham Pisarek died in West Berlin in 1983. His photographic works are part of several archives, such as the German Photographic Library, the theatrical collections of the Foundation Stadtmuseum Berlin,Theatersammlung der Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin ; abgerufen: 27.

Its western part belongs to Palatine Donnersbergkreis, its eastern part to Rhenish Hessian Alzey-Worms. The valley is named after the old municipality of Zell, which became part of the new Zellertal municipality in 1976. == Geography == The Zellertal is a trough- shaped valley with relatively gently sides and is bounded in the north and south by two chains of low hills that are under 300 m. The distance between the two hill ridges is 2 to 3 kilometres. In between, the valley stretches from west to east, sheltered from north winds. Flowing through the valley in this direction is the Pfrimm, a left ban tributary of the Rhine which is just under 43 kilometres long. The exit to the valley in the east lies at a height of about 135 m in Rhenish Hesse in the collective municipality of Monsheim, to which belong the first 3 valley parishes of Monsheim, Wachenheim and M√∂lsheim as we travel upriver. To the west, on the Palatine side, follow the next three parishes of Zellertal (Niefernheim, Zell and Harxheim) and the parishes of Einselthum, Albisheim and Marnheim. The Zellertal ends here after 12 km at 185 m. == Sights == The symbol of the valley is the 15-metre-high Zellertal Memorial which can be seen from a long way off. The Expressionist New Gothic monument was built in 1928 as a war memorial in honour of the fallen of the First World War. It is located on an exposed viewing point near the K 64 which runs along the hillside between Zell and M√∂lsheim. The Baroque pilgrimage church of Zell is dedicated to Philip of Zell, who was elevated to the sainthood in the Bishopric of Speyer. Other sights are described in the individual village articles.

The Zellertal wine region covers a larger area that the valley itself, has 15 vineyards with a lagen with a vine area of 550 hectares. The wine region includes other wine-growing municipalities such as Bischheim, Rittersheim and Gauersheim, which are in the side valley of the Leiselsbach, a left bank tributary of the Pfrimm.  Transport  The Zellertal is accessed by the B 47 (Worms‚ÄìMarnheim), which runs between the A 63 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìMainz) in the west and the B 271 (Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe‚ÄìAlzey) in the east. On the western edge of Wachenheim, the B 47 has been extended to the west as a ring road.

During the conflicts of the 1990s, militias controlled cannabis plantations around Brazzaville and Dolisie. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Republic of the Congo Category:Drugs in the Republic of the Congo ","title":"Cannabis in the Republic of the Congo"},{"id":"56132163","text":"The crane kick is a fictionalized version of the Mae tobi geri (). The move was created by Darryl Vidal for the classic film The Karate Kid (1984). The move is taught by the character Mr. Miyagi to Daniel LaRusso and eventually used in the final scene with his arch rival Johnny Lawrence. The move involves a one-legged karate stance and launches into a flying jumping kick. The movie became synonymous with karate in the United States and helped popularize the martial art in that country. == Mixed martial arts == The move's effectiveness and practicality has been questioned by critics. The premise of the technique is to lure the opponent to move forward into a counterattack by appearing vulnerable, in practice this is not tactically sound. Standing tall with one foot flat on the ground creates a stationary target for an opponent to strike while spreading arms wide leaves the head and center of mass undefended. It is also an extreme feat of athleticism for any fighter to leap off one foot (already bearing all their body weight) to deliver an effective strike with that same foot. Modified versions have been used effectively in Mixed Martial Arts, most notably by Lyoto Machida. Starting from a southpaw stance, Machida quickly feinted with his left leg before leaping off his right foot to deliver a knockout upwards right kick to the mouth of legendary former UFC champion Randy Couture. Commentators Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan immediately noted similarity to the Crane kick. == References == Category:Karate techniques Category:The Karate Kid (franchise) Category:Fictional martial arts ","title":"Crane kick"},{"id":"56132166","text":"Igor Sautkin (born 23 February 1972) is a Russian athlete.

The Bornberg has 2 summits: the Kiefernkopf and Trautmannsberg. In the northwest it is adjoined by the Herrmannsberg. To the east flows the Talbach, to the southeast, the Jettenbach and, to the west, the Reichenbach. Nearby villages are Oberweiler im Tal, E√üweiler, Jettenbach and Bosenbach. On the Bornberg is the Schneeweiderhof, a hamlet which is part of E√üweiler. Old quarry on the Bornberg From 1840 several quarries were established on the Bornberg. They were owned from 1914 by Basalt AG, Linz am Rhein and were worked until 1970. Closely linked with the quarries is the Schneeweiderhof, a hamlet in the parish of E√üweiler, where many of the quarrymen lived. In 1924 a worker's settlement, the Kolonie, was built at Schneeweiderhof which still exists today. Between 1952 and 1965 it even had its own school. In 1988, Kusel sited its county rubbish tip in the old quarries. In 2005, Meteomedia AG's E√üweiler weather station was established here as well. In November 2008, a solar farm was built next to the rubbish tip on the site of the old green waste area covering four hectares and generating 1.5 MW. It is operated by Neue Energie Pf√§lzer Bergland, a cooperative venture between Pfalzwerke AG and the county of Kusel. On the Bornberg there is also a 151-metre-high tower, the Bornberg Telecommunication Tower, owned by Deutsche Telekom which is used to broadcast several radio programmes (VHF and DAB). In 1972 a natural gas pipeline was built, running over the Bornberg from the Netherlands to Italy. In 2002, prior to the expansion of the gas pipeline, a rescue excavation was carried out on the southern hillside of the Bornberg between E√üweiler, Jettenbach and Bosenbach, as a result of which a Roman estate farm and traces of Celtic settlement were found. == External links == * Steinbr√ºche auf dem Schneeweiderhof * Ausgrabung eines r√∂mischen Gutshofes Category:Mountains and hills of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Kusel (district) ","title":"Bornberg (Palatinate)"},{"id":"56132184","text":"Kawan Lovelace (born 29 June 1976) is a Belizean athlete.

Immediately before his current assignment, he was the chairman of the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC), from 2016 until 2019. He has previously served as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Nairobi from 2005 until 2015. He is a Professor of Surgery at the University of Nairobi's College of Health Sciences. He concurrently serves as a Consultant Urologist at Kenyatta National Hospital, the teaching hospital of the university. ==Early life and education== He was born in Kisumu in 1952. He moved in with his older brother, John Obare and his wife Agatha Christine Obare, in Nairobi, on account of his (Magoha's) asthma, at a young age. He attended Dr David Livingstone Primary School, in Nairobi, the capital and largest city in Kenya. He then attended Starehe Boys' Centre and School, where he completed his O-Level studies. He then studied at Strathmore School, for his A-Level education, graduating with a High School Diploma. He excelled in his university entry examinations. He was awarded a scholarship to study human medicine at the University of Lagos, in Nigeria. His studies took him through the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, the University College Hospital, Ibadan, both in Nigeria and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, in United Kingdom. He is trained as a specialized urologist and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Ireland. ==Career== At the turn of the century (late 1990s to early 2000s), Professor Magoha was appointed chairman, dean and principal in the College of Health of Sciences and later deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Nairobi, in quick succession. In 2005 was appointed the vice-chancellor of the UoN, having scored the highest among the applicants. His most remarkable achievement at the UoN was instituting discipline among the academic staff, non-teaching staff and the students. A the time he assumed office, apparently staff members never worked, lecturers missed classes and some even lost student examination marks. Student strikes were notoriously common and had damaged the institution's reputation. By meeting openly with students to discuss their issues, he created a safety valve for ventilation and preventing them from rioting. For the 10 years he served as the vice chancellor, the students went on strike fewer times than before his time in office. In 2016, with his record as a no-nonsense education administrator, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Kenya National Examination Council, by President Uhuru Kenyatta. His immediate task as the Chairman of KNEC was to reform the council to arrest the widespread academic dishonesty and corruption in the administration of national examinations. He is credited to have dismantled cartels that had propagated exam cheating for years and restored credibility of exams in Kenya.

The portrait was commissioned by Fortunato Bartolomeo De Felice himself, an Italian count and Enlightenment figure. The portrait is one of few in existence and most fully representative work of de Felice. ==The painting== Description The current holder of the portrait, the de Felice Duchi Estate, puts this painting as the best representation of de Felice in existence. It is composed of oil paint on canvas, and an elaborate gold frame. The portrait shows de Felice sitting on a red chair, beside a large red bookcase filled with books. It is a semi-profile half-portrait of a poised, mid-speech de Felice. It seems he is at the beginning of writing a letter which could be representative of his extensive correspondence across Europe. Unfortunately, it is too obscure to make out the writing on the letters on his desk. He appears well-fed; his tightly buttoned jacket and slight double chin accentuate this. In a contrast to his austere jacket, white frills protrude at his wrist and he wears a black velvet turban. The turban is perhaps a reference to his cultured life, and the turban was becoming increasingly fashionable during the 18th Century as connections to India grew. However, there is no record of de Felice having ever visited India during his lifetime. He has blue eyes under rather heavy lids, a strong Roman nose and a hint of a mustache growing. All the interior elements match in this paintings; the red curtain that reveals the figure, the red ornately carved bookshelf, his red armchair and his red desk. The background however is split into two halves. The left containing the bookshelf and a cream-coloured section. The right hand side is a matte black, contrasting with the navy blue of his jacket and the rich velvet of his turban. ==Symbolism== It is not known if there is any significance to the middle three buttons his jacket being undone. It is also of note that as such his jacket's buttons are in order of 2, 3 and 4 buttons. Set amongst the black background is a heraldic symbol, which is not the de Felice coat of arms. It is at present unknown what it represents. It is two-thirds red; the other third is a white strip and black plume. It has been suggested that it might be the insignia of the Bern Typographical Society of which he was President. ==Notes== It is assumed that this portrait was painted at a similar time to that of his second wife, Susanne Catherine de Wavre. If the two portraits were painted at the same time, it is curious that de Felice's portrait is a great deal more rigid than de Wavre's which is practically Rococo in style. ==References== Category:1760 paintings ","title":"Portrait of Fortunato Bartolomeo de Felice"},{"id":"56132366","text":"Pusta Reka may refer to: * Pusta Reka (Kru≈°evo), a village in Republic of Macedonia, in municipality of Kru≈°evo * Pusta Reka (region), a region in Serbia around the Pusta River (Serbian: Pusta reka) == See also == * Pusta River (disambiguation) ","title":"Pusta Reka"},{"id":"56132377","text":"The 1985 NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Tournament was the 11th annual single-elimination tournament to determine the national champions of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's Division III collegiate basketball in the United States.

She trained as a cellist. ==Career== Gwen Farrar and Norah Blaney, 1920s She became famous after the World War I in partnership with Norah Blaney. Between 1921 and 1924 they appeared at leading London and provincial variety theatres, as well as in the cabaret shows: Pot Luck! (1921), starring Jack Hulbert and Beatrice Lillie; Rats (1923), starring Alfred Lester and Gertrude Lawrence; Yes! (1923), starring A. W. Bascomb, Norah Blaney and Gwen Farrar, all of which were presented by Andr√© Charlot at the Vaudeville Theatre, Strand, London; The Punch Bowl (1924), at the Duke of York's Theatre, London, with Alfred Lester, Billy Leonard, Sonnie Hale, Ralph Coram, Hermione Baddeley and Marjorie Spiers. Alone, Farrar appeared in: the revue White Birds (His Majesty's Theatre, London, 1927), starring Maurice Chevalier, Anton Dolin, Billy Mayerl, Jos√© Collins and Maisie Gay; Wonder Bar (Savoy Theatre, London, 1930), a \\"musical play of night life\\"; After Dinner (Gaiety Theatre, London, 1932) which ran for only fifteen performances. Together again, Blaney and Farrar appeared in The House that Jack Built (originally produced at the Adelphi Theatre, London, 1929) with Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge upon its transferral to the Winter Garden in 1930. Farrar appeared also in three British films: She Shall Have Music (1935), with Jack Hylton; Beloved Imposter (1936), which featured the popular pianist Leslie Hutchinson; and Take a Chance (1937), with Binnie Hale, Claude Hulbert and Harry Tate. ==Personal life== At the time of her father's death, the Farrar family were living at Chicheley Hall, Buckinghamshire, which her father had rented from John G. Chester, whose family had owned the hall since the 1500s. The death of her father left Gwen a comfortable fortune which, in addition to her own earnings on stage, made her an independent woman. After her mother's death, some of her sisters continued to live as tenants at Chicheley Hall. For a time she lived in Effingham, Surrey, with Blaney. She was friends with Radclyffe Hall, Joe Carstairs and their circle. She was romantically linked to actress Tallulah Bankhead when the latter was living in London. She died after a short illness on 25 December 1944. ==Legacy== A 2014's play, All The Nice Girls by Alison Child and Rosie Wakley, tells the personal and professional partnership of Gwen Farrar and Norah Blaney.

Tilden The Tilden Trust was a fund established in the will of Samuel J. Tilden upon his death on August 4, 1886. The will, dated April 23, 1884, provided for the establishment of a 'Tilden Trust' to \\"establish and maintain a free library and reading room in the City of New York.\\" The estate Tilden left was valued at almost $10 million, consisted of $200,000 invested in iron mines in both New York and Michigan; another $200,000 was invested in real estate. A further $1 million was left to Tilden's relatives, and a total of $110,000 was dedicated to providing municipal services to New Lebanon, New York, and Yonkers, New York. The remainder, a balance of about $5 million was left to the library. George H. Tilden, a nephew of Samuel Tilden, filed a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court; soon followed by many other Tilden relatives. The relatives contested the 35th clause of the will, which established the Tilden Trust. The case ended in October 1891, when the New York Court of Appeals declared the clause invalid. Under the ruling, all of the money left by Tilden was to go to his descendants. Through several legal deals, the trust was still founded, and had a fund of two and a quarter million dollars. By that time, the money was not enough to fund a complete library, and in 1895, the Tilden Trust was merged with the Lenox Library and Astor Library to form the New York Public Library. ==Background== Tilden's family was in the patent medicine business, and became wealthy through sales of Tilden's Extract, a popular drug derived from cannabis. Tilden, a politician who served as the 25th Governor of New York and was the Democratic candidate for president in the disputed election of 1876, was a skilled corporate attorney and financial manager who invested in a variety of commodities and financial instruments, including iron mines, real estate, and stock and bonds. He is the only individual to win an outright majority of the popular vote in a United States presidential election but lose the election itself. ==Will== Samuel Jones Tilden died on August 4, 1886. He left behind an estate valued at almost 10 million dollars. The will had 43 clauses, the first 32 of which dealt with relatives. Small amounts of money, ranging from $15,000 to $150,000 were left to various heirs, including Mary B. Pelton, Lucy F. Tilden, Susan G. Tilden, Caroline B. Whittlesey, Henrietta Swan, George H. Tilden, Samuel J. Tilden II, Ruby S. Tilden, Susan G. Tilden, Anna J. Gould, Mary Stauffer, and Henrietta Jones. The 33rd clause left $115,000 to the establishment of a library in New Lebanon, New York. The 34th clause was much the same as the 33rd, and established a library in Yonkers, New York. The 35th clause left the majority of his money for the establishment of a library in New York City. The other clauses funded upkeep of the New Lebanon Cemetery, and felt with various legal aspects of the other clauses. The will was dated April 23, 1884, and signed in the presence of Edward H. Dixon and Charles E. Simmons. ==History== Formation of the Trust The Tilden Trust was formally established by an act of the New York State Legislature, which passed on March 26, 1887. The act established the Trust with three permanent trustees who were able to appoint other trustees. The three appointed for life were, Andrew H. Green, George W. Smith, and John Bigelow. In 1893, two additional trustees were appointed, Alexander E. Orr and Stephen Walker, the latter of whom would die that same year. After Walkers death, Lewis Cass Ledyard was appointed to fill his vacancy. Legal Challenges Soon after the release of the will, various relatives of Tilden, led by George H. Tilden filed suit. The New York State Supreme Court upheld the validity of the will in 1889, but later that year reversed the decision. The Tilden trust subsequently appealed the ruling. The New York Court of Appeals had yet to rule on the case when the Trust settled with one of the litigants. For a payment of $975,000, she gave up her claim to the Tilden estate. On October 27, 1891, the Court of Appeals sustained the ruling of the State Supreme Court. The Tilden Trust later settled with the other relatives on March 30, 1892. Under the settlement, the Trust received the various literary holdings of Tilden, real estate, and other various investments valued at a total of almost $2,000,000. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:New York Public Library ","title":"Tilden Trust"},{"id":"56132477","text":"Lex is a mini-album and partial soundtrack by Portland, Oregon duo Visible Cloaks, consisting of Spencer Doran and Ryan Carlile.

The music is led by aliens trying to speak a hybrid of several languages but end up speaking a \\"non-language\\" as a result. Doran stated the speeches were meant to be a commentary on inaccurate translations that most translation applications makes. The speeches are the most commonplace on Lex's first four tracks, which Raven labeled as more \\"fragmented, unsettled, and inscrutable\\" than Reassemblage. The record becomes almost entirely ambient by the title track, however, with only bits of the alien voices before completing disappearing on its 14-minute closer \\"World.\\" Returning to the \\"dreamy\\" tones of Reassemblage, \\"World\\" is a \\"fixed\\" version of a \\"generative composition\\" that Doran made for an installation he worked on with artist Brenna Murphy; that's according to the press release, though it didn't specify which installation. While the original version of the composition consists of erratic MIDI notes and uses of low-frequency oscillation, the version that appears on Lex is about \\"a more conclusive view\\" of the \\"deepening, patient intimations\\" the future world of Lex will likely bring.

SLSF contracts professional actors through Canadian Actors Equity Association, is a member of PACT (the Professional Association of Canadian Theatres), and a member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association. The offerings of the Festival are based on two main stage shows that run from mid- July to mid-August (often, but not always, both plays by Shakespeare) as well as additional productions that are presented in shorter runs of fewer performances. SLSF was founded in 2002, when Artistic Director Deborah Smith brought a small touring production of Romeo and Juliet through Prescott for a single performance. During that visit, Smith saw the open-air amphitheatre that had been constructed overlooking the harbour, and made arrangements with then mayor, Sandra S. Lawn (after whom the harbour is now named) to return the following year, 2003, to mount a full production of The Tempest. Three Artistic Directors have followed. Ian Farthing, who had acted with the Festival, was appointed in 2006 and held the position until 2014. Farthing increased the number of mainstage productions from one to two, added a Sunday series of special events and an educational program. Highlights of those years included a 2011 production of Twelfth Night, which won the Prix Rideau Award for Outstanding Production in the greater Ottawa-Gatineau region, and adaptations by Canadian playwrights of some less frequently produced works by Shakespeare such as The Merry Wives of Windsor (adapted by playwright John Lazarus for Prescott‚Äôs 200th anniversary year as Trouble on Dibble Street), and Love‚Äôs Labour‚Äôs Lost (adapted by playwright Lucia Frangione to a War of 1812 setting as A Maid for a Musket). In 2014, SLSF won the distinction of being the only Canadian Theatre to present Shakespeare‚Äôs Globe Theatre‚Äôs international touring production of Hamlet, for two sold-out performances. Rona Waddington followed Farthing, programming the next three years of the Festival. Innovations introduced by Waddington included recruiting a team of local volunteers to plays crowds and soldiers in productions of Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra, facilitating work on a scale that had not yet been seen at the Festival, and a series of ‚ÄúCommunity Productions‚Äù, in which post- season productions were directed by Waddington, as fundraisers for the Festival, that exclusively featured local amateur actors After the 2017 season, Waddington departed and Richard Sheridan Willis, who had appeared in the festival as an actor for three seasons was named as the new Artistic Director. The 2018 season is Willis‚Äôs first programmed as Artistic Director. ==References== Category:Theatre festivals in Ontario Category:Theatre companies in Ontario Category:Shakespearean theatre companies Category:Festivals established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Ontario ","title":"St Lawrence Shakespeare Festival"},{"id":"56132619","text":"Adrian Mannarino was the defending champion but chose not to defend his title.

They measured 32 meters in length, with a beam of 4 meters and a draught of 1 meter. Named OMm35 and OMm36, the two boats displaced 60 tons each. Initially, they were armed with two machine guns on a single mount and were able to carry up to 22 mines. They were powered by two diesel engines generating an output of 900 hp powering two shafts, which gave the two vessels a top speed of 19 knots. Seized by the Germans in 1939, they were briefly commissioned by the Kriegsmarine as FM1 and FM2, before being transferred to the Romanian Navy in 1941 as V5 and V6. In Romanian service, their armament was increased to one 20 mm anti-aircraft gun and two twin plus two single 8 mm machine guns. The two twin machine guns were protected by 48 mm of armour and the conning tower by 6 mm.

It was not a single genocide but a collection of ethnic wars which raged from Sudan, the Congo, through to Uganda and Rwanda. ==Details== In the southern region of the Sudan, two million people belonging to various Nilotic peoples including Dinka, Nuer and Shilluk were killed by Sudanese Arabs from the North. Roughly five and a half million died in the Congo, mainly during the Second Congo War but also in relatively smaller holocausts such as the Ituri conflict and the mass murder of Pygmies known as \\"Effacer le tableau\\". In Uganda, 300 thousand people were murdered during the regime of Idi Amin and 500 thousand during the rule of his successor, Milton Obote. Amin's genocides targeted the Acholi and Lango peoples; these two groups went on to kill other groups (mainly the Baganda) under Obote's regime. In the early 1970s, over 150 thousand Hutu people were killed by Tutsi people in Burundi by order of General Michel Micombero. Twenty years later, one million Tutsi people were killed by Hutu people during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In the Rwandan genocide, the people who had been the victims in Burundi (the Hutu) killed the ethnic group that had killed them (the Tutsi), and these new victims later played a role in the Congo genocide. In all of these deaths, the victims were killed by people from a different ethnic group. Ten million deaths occurred in close proximity. ==Notes== Category:Genocides Category:Genocides in Africa ","title":"Genocides in central Africa"},{"id":"56132997","text":"Nicola Martial (born 13 March 1974) is a Guyanese athlete.

The troubles are significant because in Goldfield the IWW gained its greatest degree of power in a labor market, and came closest to its ideal of \\"the one big union.\\"Paul Frederick Brissenden, 1919, \\"The I.W.W., a study of American syndicalism,\\" Studies in History, Economics, and Public Law, v.83, n.193.p.191‚Äì192 The power of the IWW was ended by the controversial occupation by federal troops in December 1907. ==Background== A burro-drawn wagon hauling lumber and supplies into Goldfield, Nevada, ca. 1904. In 1903 only 36 people lived in the new town. By 1908 Goldfield was Nevada's largest city, with over 25,000 inhabitants. Goldfield was organized as a town in October 1903 near recently discovered gold deposits in a remote spot of the southern Nevada desert.Sally Zanjani, Goldfield (Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1992).p.24 The population of the town rose to between 15,000 and 18,000 during the boom of 1904-1905, with another 2,000 in the suburbs. This briefly made Goldfield the most populous town in Nevada. Numerous new mining companies were established to mine at Goldfield, and shares found a ready market of investors. Demand for labor outstripped supply, giving labor unions the advantage. Rise to power of the IWW A group of miners (forming a mine shift) pose in front of mine headframe (shaft), Goldfield, Nevada, ca. 1905. In November, 1906, the Goldfield Consolidated Mines Company was incorporated by owners George Wingfield and United States Senator George Nixon, signaling the beginning of monopoly control in Goldfield, and the start of an adversarial relationship between mine owners and the unions. Soon after mining on an extensive scale began at Goldfield, the miners organized themselves as a local branch of the Western Federation of Miners. The Industrial Workers of the World was founded in 1905 in Chicago. Soon after, the Western Federation of Miners affiliated with the IWW, as its mining department. The description of the IWW as \\"one big union\\" summarized their negotiating tactics: a wrong done to any worker was seen as the concern of all workers, and was likely to be met with a general strike. The IWW also espoused radical socialism, and eschewed political action in favor of \\"direct action,\\" with the goal of eliminating private ownership of businesses. One of the forms of direct action favored by the IWW was sabotage, which the union, officially at least, defined as working inefficiently or stupidly, so as to reduce profits of business owners, and thus hasten the end of capitalism. American Federation of Labor president Samuel Gompers observed that, as used by the IWW, \\"In actual practice it is hard to distinguish direct action, sabotage, and violence.\\"Samuel Gompers, \\"Editorial,\\" American Federationist, July 1912, v.20 n.7 p.535. After the affiliation of the WFM with the IWW in 1905, the IWW organized nearly all the other workers in town, including bartenders, newsboys, and faro dealers. The numerous mining companies were under pressure from shareholders to show gold production without delay, which gave the unions further advantage. At the height of its power in Goldfield, he IWW did not even negotiate, but simply posted wage rates and required that employers comply. Local IWW leader Vincent St. John fondly recalled: :\\"The highest point of efficiency for any labor organization was reached by the I.W.W. and W.F.M. in Goldfield, Nevada. No committees were ever sent to any employers. The unions adopted wage scales and regulated hours. The secretary posted the same on a bulletin board outside of the union hall, and it was the LAW.\\"p.201 The mine owners were upset with the radicalism of the IWW, as well as with the high wages, and suggested that the WFM chapter (the mine workers) merge with the IWW chapter (the town workers), expecting that the more conservative miners would dampen the radicalism of the IWW. However, exactly the opposite happened, and the IWW radicals came to dominate the mine workers. The union declared strikes in December 1906 and January 1907 for higher wages. The mine owners capitulated both times. IWW influence was at its peak on January 20, 1907, when all mines, restaurants, and saloons in Goldfield shut down on orders from the IWW, to increase attendance at the union's parade commemorating slain Russian revolutionaries, and to support Big Bill Haywood and two other WFM leasers, then under arrest in Idaho for conspiracy to murder ex-governor Steunenberg. That night, veteran WFM organizer Vincent St. John spoke to a packed audience in the union hall, promised revolution, and proclaimed: \\"We have no enemy but the capitalist class!\\"p.33-35,223-224 Mine owner George Wingfield's spies in the IWW reported that Vincent St. John saw Nevada as an isolated state with a small population where he could achieve his dream of a syndicalist-socialist utopia. Starting with Goldfield as a nucleus, he thought that the IWW could organize the whole state, then shut down the state in a general strike, after which the IWW would simply step in and run things, in place of state and local governments.p.223 A Chicago Record-Herald reporter wrote from Goldfield: \\"Socialism never had such a taste of the sweets of autocracy as it had in this southern Nevada mining camp, and it grew drunk with its power.\\"Marion G. Scheitlin, \\"Goldfield under labor trust rule,\\" reprinted in The Square Deal, March 1908, v.3 n.8 p.26. \\"The one big union\\" splits Nationally, many WFM members were wary of the radicalism of the IWW, and did not want to give financial control to the IWW. The WFM delegates walked out of the 1906 IWW convention when the more radical faction - those opposed to political action - won control of the IWW. In 1907 the WFM, which made up about a third of the IWW membership, voted in a referendum to withdraw from the IWW.p.194 But for some time after the breakup, the WFM and IWW in Goldfield continued to work closely together. The leader of the WFM chapter in Goldfield was Vincent St. John, who shared the revolutionary ideals of the IWW. Some workers unwilling to join the IWW/WFM were forcibly ejected from the town by IWW members, sometimes accompanied by beatings. In their quest for the \\"one big union,\\" with revolutionary ideals, the IWW did not compromise with or accommodate other unions, and often fought rival unions as hard as they fought capitalism. Critics called this policy \\"rule or ruin.\\" By 1907, the only two unions in Goldfield holding out against joining the IWW/WFM were two AFL-affiliated locals: the Carpenters Union, and the Typesetters' union at the Goldfield Sun. Goldfield Sun The IWW demanded that typesetters for the Goldfield Sun join the IWW. When they refused to do so, the IWW demanded that Lindley Branson, the owner and editor of the Sun, who also owned the Tonopah Sun, fire all non-IWW workers. But the Sun typesetters had been in the AFL Typesetters' Union for years, and the Sun had long recognized their union, and paid them union wages. The typesetters saw no reason to switch unions, and the Sun owner refused to fire them, and criticized the IWW in strong terms in his newspapers. In retaliation, the IWW, which was famous for its free speech fights, tried to shut down the Sun by orchestrating boycotts. The IWW ordered the town newsboys, all members of the IWW, to refuse to carry the Sun.p.192-193 The IWW pressured businesses to stop advertising in the Sun, threatening boycotts against any businesses that did not fall in line. Individual IWW members could be fined $15 for buying the Sun. The IWW set down conditions for ending its boycotts of the Sun. Conditions included a published apology to the IWW, and a publication of a weekly column written by the IWW. Rather than surrender his editorial independence to the IWW, Branson sold the Goldfield Sun in August 1907, and moved 27 miles north to Tonopah, where his Tonopah Sun continued to criticize the IWW.p.166‚Äì167 The death of Anton Silva  As part of their campaign against the AFL Carpenters' Union, the IWW threatened restaurants with union boycotts if they served meals to non-IWW carpenters. Most fell in line, but restaurateur Anton Silva continued to serve the AFL Carpenters, so the IWW declared a boycott against Silva, and began picketing his restaurant; business dropped drastically. When Silva confronted two pickets, W. R. Preston and Joseph Smith, in a threatening manner, Preston shot and killed Silva. Preston, a business agent of the IWW, pleaded self-defense, but a jury convicted him. The jury also convicted Smith, an officer of the union, for being an accomplice. The two received sentences of 25 years and 10 years.Marion G. Scheitlin, \\"Goldfield under labor trust rule,\\" reprinted in The Square Deal, March 1908, v.3 n.8 p.26. The case became a rallying-point for both sides. The IWW insisted that Preston shot in self-defense, and that Smith was just a bystander, but that they were falsely convicted because of their union activism. The mine owners said that it was a premeditated plot to murder Silva, as an example to others.p.221 ==The lockout, March 1907== In March 1907, the IWW ordered the AFL Carpenters to either join the IWW or leave town. The Carpenters did neither, but instead started carrying firearms to work. The IWW ordered the mine owners to stop employing members of the AFL Carpenters union. Instead, the mine owners banded together, and declared that they would hire no IWW members. To achieve this, the mine owners declared a lockout. But once more, the mine owners gave in, and on 1 April 1907, signed an agreement to last two years, under which only members of the Goldfield Miners' Union (the local branch of the WFM) were allowed to work in and around the mines, excepting only managers and superintendents.Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor, September 1908, n.78 p.587-588. The WFM and IWW had achieved their goals of bringing nearly all workers in Goldfield into the two unions. Highgrading Beginning in August 1907, a rule was introduced at some of the mines requiring miners to change their clothing before entering and after leaving the mines ‚Äî a rule made necessary, according to the operators, by the wholesale stealing (in miners' parlance, \\"high-grading\\") of the very valuable ore (some of it valued at as high as $20 a pound). ==The miners strike, November 1907== Miners had traditionally been paid in cash. In November 1907, following upon a nationwide financial panic, some of the owners adopted a system of paying wages half in gold, and half in cashier's checks drawn on the John T. Cook Bank in Goldfield. The miners insisted on being paid in legal tender or guaranteed checks. After several weeks of futile negotiations, the Goldfield Miners Union went out on strike on 27 November 1907.p.198 Sending in federal troops The mine owners did not want a repeat of their unsuccessful lockout of the previous March. The mine owners convinced Governor John Sparks that troops were needed to prevent violence. But the governor could not send in the state militia, because there was no state militia. Governor Sparks asked President Theodore Roosevelt to send federal troops into Goldfield, writing that violence at Goldfield included \\"unlawful dynamiting of property, commission of felonies, threats against the lives of law-abiding citizens, ...\\"p.196 But Roosevelt hesitated. Federal troops were by law a last resort, and there did not seem to be widespread disorder in the town. Also, he saw no political advantage in being embroiled in a labor dispute. Roosevelt was skeptical, but after several Nevada officials assured him that uncontrolled violence existed in Goldfield, Roosevelt sent Brigadier General Frederick Funston, commander of the Division of California, at San Francisco, to investigate. Funston told Roosevelt that although violence was not prevalent at the time, that at least 300 of the 1,000 striking miners were radicals prone to violence. Funston recommended that Army troops be sent to Goldfield to maintain order.Clayton D. Laurie and Ronald H. Cole, The Role of Federal Military Forces in Domestic Disorders 1877‚Äì1945(Washington: US Army Center of Military History, 1997).p.195‚Äì196 Roosevelt followed Funston's advice, and US Army troops arrived from San Francisco on 7 December 1907. The mine owners immediately requested that the troops be assigned to guard the mines, but Colonel Reynolds, the commander of the Army troops, refused. He had been directed by his superiors to take orders only from Washington, not those of state or local officials, or mine owners. Reynolds been sent to put down an insurrection, and had arrived to find a peaceful situation. As far as he was concerned, he and his men had no reason to be there, although this was not the opinion of his superior, General Funston.p.196‚Äì197 Mindful of the controversial actions of federal troops in the mining labor disputes at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in 1892 and 1899, Roosevelt repeatedly urged the Army to act with restraint. The president admonished Funston by telegram: :\\"The troops are not sent to take either side in a purely industrial dispute, as long as it is kept within the bounds of law and order. They are to be neither for nor against the strikers or the employers.\\"p.199 Mine owners reduce wages The day after troops arrived, the mine owners reduced wages, and announced that the mines would reopen 12 December, with imported nonunion labor if needed. Conditions remained peaceful, but once the mines brought in nonunion men, violence became highly probable if the troops were to be withdrawn. Colonel Reynolds saw that the mine owners had planned the pay cut, but had needed the presence of his troops to impose it without suffering violence and disorder. Torn between the report of Col. Reynolds that Goldfield was peaceful, and messages from General Funston and state officials that the situation was too dangerous to withdraw troops, Roosevelt appointed a special commission to investigate and report back. Roosevelt's commission noted the radical views of the miners' union leadership, and advised Roosevelt that following the pay cuts announced by the mine owners, withdrawal of troops would result in violence. Roosevelt concluded that although conditions had not warranted Sparks's appeal for assistance, that the immediate withdrawal of the troops might lead to serious disorder. So he consented that troops should remain for a short time, but on condition that the state should immediately organize an adequate militia or police force. Accordingly, a special meeting of the legislature was immediately called, the Nevada State Police was organized, and on March 7, 1908, the last federal troops were withdrawn. Thereafter, work was gradually resumed in the mines, the contest having been won by the mine owners. The labor struggle coincided with a national economic downturn, and consequent loss of investment, and jobs, in Nevada mining companies. It also took place while the national WFM was withdrawing from affiliation with the IWW. The split between the two nationally made it more difficult to present a united front against the mine owners. Former WFM official Vincent St. John, who went with the IWW, complained that the \\"fight was compromised by the treachery of the W.F.M. general officers.\\"p.194 ==Aftermath== The intense mining activity at Goldfield was sustained in part by promotional stock investments. When Goldfield mining shares lost favor with investors, the bubble burst. By 1908, the population had shrunk to 5,400, and by 1910, it was only 1,600.p.232‚Äì233 ==Citations== Category:1906 in Nevada Category:1907 in Nevada Category:Labor-related violence in the United States Category:Goldfield, Nevada Category:Labor disputes in Nevada Category:1906 labor disputes and strikes Category:1907 labor disputes and strikes Category:Industrial Workers of the World in Nevada Category:Labor disputes led by the Industrial Workers of the World Category:Western Federation of Miners ","title":"Goldfield, Nevada labor troubles of 1906‚Äì1907"},{"id":"56133171","text":"Michael Farber (born September 1951)https://jeffpearlman.com/michael-farber/ is an American author and sports journalist, and was a writer with Sports Illustrated from 1994 to 2014.

The Los Angeles-based duo gained popularity for their remixes, original discography, and hour-long ‚ÄòBig Bootie‚Äô mixes. They have most notably remixed classics such as Blink 182‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Miss You‚Äô and The Killers' ‚ÄòMr. Brightside,‚Äô with official remixes for Lana Del Rey, Tove Lo, The Chainsmokers, Tori Kelly, Vicetone and Echosmith as well. == Early life == Eli grew up in Los Angeles, while Matt moved around before settling into LA at the age of ten. They met each other in seventh grade while attending Brentwood School throughout their middle and high school years. At the very end of high school, the duo formed Two Friends, coming up with the name together during a Senior Seminar class they had both enrolled in. They began working on hip-hop beats in the software Pro Tools, producing for several up-and-coming rappers before pivoting towards the electronic realm. After visiting the Sahara Tent at Coachella and being slowly introduced to electronic music by some friends and family, they became even more fascinated with the emerging genre and soon dove in head-first. Growing up, Matt had a strong background in music, starting guitar lessons at the age of eight, training in music theory, and singing in his high school choir. Traditionally his listening interests were dominated by alternative rock and rock classics such as Blink-182, Led Zeppelin, and Bon Jovi. Eli's focus was more centralized around DJing and mashups. During high school, Sones went by the moniker \\"The Friendly Giant\\" before linking up with Halper and forming Two Friends. His early musical interests were predominantly hip-hop and indie rock. Soon after starting to create music together, Eli moved to Nashville, Tennessee to attend Vanderbilt University and Matt to Palo Alto to attend Stanford University. Matt majored in Product Design and Eli in Human & Organizational Development, but much of their time was dedicated to the Two Friends project. For the most part, the first four years of Two Friends was long-distance; however since graduating and returning home to LA in 2015, Matt & Eli have been working the Two Friends project full-time. == Musical style == Two Friends recently described their music as \\"songs that are fun and get you dancing and moving, but also hopefully resonate with you on a more emotional level at the same time... [They are] kind of a melting pot of a lot of different elements and influences- whether from dance music, from pop, even from alternative rock or hip-hop.\\" == Music career == One of their first big opportunities came in 2014, when their remix of Lana Del Rey's ‚ÄúBorn To Die‚Äù was added to regular rotation on SiriusXM‚Äôs EDM Station BPM. Later in 2014, they released two singles with the band ‚ÄòBreach the Summit‚Äô (now known as Armors) titled ‚ÄúOur Names in Lights‚Äù and ‚ÄúLong Way Home‚Äù. Their next originals came in 2016 with ‚ÄúForever‚Äù and ‚ÄúOverdose‚Äù on Armada Music, both amassing millions of plays throughout Spotify, Soundcloud and other streaming services. In 2016 the musical group toured more vigorously than ever before, playing frequently across North America. Their second and most popular EP ‚ÄúOut Of Love‚Äù was released in early 2017 through Spinnin' Records, featuring what would become two of their most popular songs, ‚ÄúOut Of Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúPacific Coast Highway‚Äù. They subsequently embarked on the ‚ÄúOut Of Love Tour‚Äù in the beginning of 2017. The remainder of 2017 saw the releases ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhile We‚Äôre Dreaming‚Äù and ‚ÄúJust A Kid‚Äù, with the accompanying tours including shows at major venues and festivals such as Electric Forest Festival, Terminal 5, and more. The ‚ÄúJust A Kid Tour‚Äù is scheduled for early 2018 with an extensive, US-dominated calendar of dates. The duo has amassed over twenty-seven #1 tracks on Hype Machine, as well as garnered praise from The Chainsmokers, who named them ‚ÄúMost Underrated Artist‚Äù in a 2017 Reddit Thread.

This mainly takes the form of either mind-matter dualism in Buddhist philosophy or consciousness-matter dualism in the Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy. These can be contrasted with mind-body dualism in Western philosophy of mind, but also have similarities with it. Another form of dualism in Hindu philosophy is found in the Dvaita (\\"dualism\\") Vedanta school, which regards God and the world as two realities with distinct essences; this is a form of theistic dualism. By contrast, schools such as Advaita (\\"nondualism\\") Vedanta embrace absolute monism and regard dualism as an illusion (maya). ==Buddhist philosophy== Dharmakƒ´rti, a key theorist of Buddhist atomism. During the classical era of Buddhist philosophy in India, philosophers such as Dharmakirti argued for a dualism between states of consciousness and Buddhist atoms (the basic building blocks that make up reality), according to the \\"standard interpretation\\" of Dharmakirti's Buddhist metaphysics.Georges B.J. Dreyfus, Recognizing Reality, SUNY Press 1996 () ==Samkhya and Yogic philosophy== While Western philosophical traditions, as exemplified by Descartes, equate mind with the conscious self and theorize on consciousness on the basis of mind/body dualism, some Eastern philosophies provide an alternate viewpoint, intimately related to substance dualism, by drawing a metaphysical line between consciousness and matter ‚Äî where matter includes both body and mind.Haney, p. 17.Isaac, p. 339. In Samkhya and Yoga, two of the six orthodox (ƒÅstika) schools of Hindu philosophy, \\"there are two irreducible, innate and independent realities: 1) consciousness itself (Purusha), and 2) primordial materiality (Prakriti)\\". The unconscious primordial materiality, Prakriti, contains 23 components including intellect (buddhi, mahat), ego (ahamkara) and mind (manas). Therefore, the intellect, mind and ego are all seen as forms of unconscious matter.Haney, p. 42. Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from Purusha. Consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or 'shapes' assumed by the mind. So intellect after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness creates thought structures that appear to be conscious.Isaac, p. 342. Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them.Leaman, p. 68. But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates. By including mind in the realm of matter, Samkhya Yoga avoids one of the most serious pitfalls of Cartesian dualism, the violation of physical conservation laws by involving something non-material (Cartesian mind) in human actions. Because in Samkhya Yoga mind is an evolute of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy and are therefore able to initiate bodily motions.Leaman, p. 248. ==Dvaita philosophy== The Dvaita Vedanta school of Indian philosophy espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the more important reality is that of Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu or Brahman. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme Self, God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul (Jiva), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to Advaita Vedanta (monistic conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe. Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. Salvation therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.Fowler, Jeaneane D.

J, 4, 90-94.) states that the steady irrotational motion of an incompressible fluid occupying a simply connected region has less kinetic energy than any other motion with the same normal component of velocity at the boundary (and, if the domain extends to infinity, with zero value values there)Kelvin, W.

An introduction to fluid dynamics. Cambridge university press.Truesdell, C. (1954). The kinematics of vorticity (Vol. 954). Bloomington: Indiana University Press.. ==Mathematical Proof== Let \\\\mathbf{u} be the velocity field of an incompressible irrotational fluid and \\\\mathbf{u_1} be that of any other incompressible fluid motion with same normal component velocity \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}=\\\\mathbf{u_1}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n} at the boundary of the domain, where \\\\mathbf{n} is the unit vector of the bounding surface (and, if the domain extends to infinity, \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}=\\\\mathbf{u_1}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}=0 there). Then the difference between the kinetic energy is given by :T_1-T = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho \\\\int(\\\\mathbf{u}_1^2-\\\\mathbf{u}^2)\\\\ dV can be rearranged to give :T_1-T = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho \\\\int(\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})^2\\\\ dV + \\\\rho \\\\int (\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\ dV. Since \\\\mathbf{u} is irrotational and the domain is simply-connected, a single-valued velocity potential exists, i.e., \\\\mathbf{u}= abla\\\\phi. Using this, the second integral in the above equation can be written as :\\\\int (\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\cdot abla\\\\phi\\\\ dV = \\\\int abla\\\\cdot[(\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\phi]\\\\ dV - \\\\int\\\\phi abla\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\ dV. The second integral is identically zero for steady incompressible fluid, i.e., abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}= abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}_1=0. Applying the Gauss theorem for the first integral we find :\\\\int (\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\cdot abla\\\\phi\\\\ dV = \\\\int \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\ dA where the surface integral is zero since normal component of velocities are equal there. Thus, one concludes :T_1-T=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho \\\\int(\\\\mathbf{u}_1-\\\\mathbf{u})^2\\\\ dV \\\\geq 0 or in other words, T_1\\\\geq T, where the equality holds only if \\\\mathbf{u}_1=\\\\mathbf{u}, thereby proving the theorem. ==References== Category:Fluid dynamics ","title":"Kelvin's minimum energy theorem"},{"id":"56133482","text":"Arvo Anselm Laine (8 August 1887 - 24 April 1938) was a Finnish athlete.

A member of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe from 1983 to 1990, he served as the Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement from 1988 to 1990. He entered Parliament as an independent, before joining the ruling ZANU‚ÄìPF party in 1987. == Biography == Kay was born circa 1921. In 1948, he purchased 5,000 acres of virgin land in Wedza District, near Marandellas (now Marondera), Southern Rhodesia. He named it Chipesa Farm, and grew maize and tobacco. It supported hundreds of workers and their families. As a farmer, Kay was known as a pioneer of cooperative irrigation techniques.  Political career  In 1983, Kay ran as an independent candidate for Parliament in a by-election for the Makoni white roll constituency. The previous member, Arthur Tapson, resigned to move to South Africa. Makoni, a conservative farming area, was one of 20 seats in Parliament reserved for whites per the Lancaster House Agreement. In the election on 30 September, Kay earned 493 votes, defeating Republican Front candidate Fran√ßois Smit with 434 votes. Kay's election caused Opposition Leader Ian Smith's conservative Republican Front party to lose their majority of the white roll seats in Parliament. In 1985, he won reelection to Parliament in Makoni, this time running as a member of the Independent Zimbabwe Group, a coalition of white moderates. Kay, with 707 votes, defeated Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe candidate Shelagh Gertrude van Reenen with 658 votes. On 28 July 1987, Kay crossed the aisle to join Prime Minister Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU‚ÄìPF party, along with two other white MPs, John Landau and Tony Read. In September 1987, having achieved the support of 75% of the House of Assembly as required under the Lancaster House Agreement, the constitution was amended to abolish the white roll constituencies. A number of new members were co-opted onto the House of Assembly to replace the departing white members. Kay, along with several other white ZANU‚ÄìPF members, were allowed to keep their seats. On 22 January 1988, Kay was appointed Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement. He was one of two white deputy ministers, along with Charles Duke. His appointment as the deputy of Minister David Karimanzira, because he was a white farmer himself, was thought to help to assuage the concerns of the country's 4,500 white farmers. However, a United States State Department private communication at the time reported that his inexperience and \\"questionable\\" professional competence caused some farmers to be uncertain as to whether Kay would be able to protect the interests of white commercial farmers. As deputy minister, Kay focused on promoting irrigation and combating soil loss through erosion. In the 1990 Zimbabwean general election, Kay did not run for reelection to Parliament. Shortly after, he was dropped from the cabinet in a presidential announcement. == Personal life == He was married to Peggy Kay. Their son, Iain, is also a politician.

This series is the first to feature two different teams of heroes: the gentleman thief- based Lupinrangers and the police-based Patrangers who engage in a three-way battle against an alien criminal organization targeting Earth. It is also the first Super Sentai TV series to not have an ending theme like many of TV Asahi's other shows. Lupinranger VS Patranger, which was the last Super Sentai series to air entirely in the Heisei era, premiered on February 11, 2018 and ended on February 10, 2019, joining Kamen Rider Build and later, Kamen Rider Zi-O in the Super Hero Time line-up on TV Asahi affiliate stations. Lupinranger VS Patranger began airing in South Korea on June 2020 as Power Rangers Lupin Force VS Patrol Force during its airing. ==Story== The Lupin Collection, a vast ensemble of dangerous items acquired by the legendary gentleman thief Ars√®ne Lupin, is stolen by an interdimensional crime syndicate known as the Gangler. However, they receive opposition from two Super Sentai teams: the Lupinrangers: Kairi Yano, Toma Yoimachi and Umika Hayami, who aim to steal back the collection to live up their namesake's reputation and save those they have lost, and the Patrangers: Keiichiro Asaka, Sakuya Hikawa and Tsukasa Myojin, who are tasked with upholding justice by retrieving the collection and taking down the Gangler. A human drama unfolds that pits the opposing teams against each other as their tale is woven, which is made more intricate by the Lupin Collection's mysterious origins and its contributor No√´l Takao, who aids the two teams as their fourth member in the hopes of uniting them against the Gangler for his own agenda. After the Gangler are eventually defeated, the Patrangers learn the Lupinrangers' civilian identities and motives while No√´l still works to unite the two Super Sentai teams into one. ==Characters== Lupinrangers The Lupinrangers are a trio of phantom thieves who are recruited by Ars√®ne Lupin's retainer to save their loved ones, who were taken by the Gangler member, Zamigo Delma, a year prior. The group is based at the cafe as part-time workers, where they learn the Patrangers's identities while concealing their own until the events of the final battle. The Lupinrangers wield transformation firearms and the , which enable them to decode and unlock a Gangler member's safe, as well as the sidearm which doubles as a reach extender. By setting Good Striker into the VS Changer, a Lupinranger can split into three to perform the finisher along with their teammates.

Patrangers The Patrangers are a trio of police officers from the (GSPO), an international police force based in France that was established to deal with the Gangler menace. The group are based at the GSPO's Japan Branch, which is in the same neighborhood as the Bistrot Jurer. The Patrangers wield their own transformation firearms, the , and the megaphone-like sidearm, which has a baton mode.

Pat Kaiser can also assume alternate formations by substituting their regular Trigger Machines with auxiliaries. ; : A hot-blooded, serious police officer and leader of the Patrangers who uses to transform into the red-colored . He puts his duties as a police officer first in pursuing Gangler members and protecting civilians. While he has a positive view on how the Lupin Collection could be used for good, he initially expressed disdain towards the Lupinrangers before learning of Lupin Red's motives and realizing the group is more than they appeared. As Keiichiro grew up with a kind and loving family, he did not know suffering until he met Kairi. After learning of his past and how his brother became one of Zamigo's victims, Keiichiro understands what it means to suffer. : By setting the Siren Striker into the VS Changer, Patren 1gou can become the armored , which grants a pair of shoulder cannons. : Keiichiro Asaka is portrayed by . ; : An optimistic junior to Keiichiro and Tsukasa who uses to transform into the green-colored .

Sakuya is observant and quick-thinking, though he considers doing his job and protecting civilians as more important than the GSPO's reputation. Unlike Keiichiro, he has a positive view of the Lupinrangers. Sakuya later fell in love with Umika, and denies that she is a Lupinranger until he learned of their identities and learned of Umika's reasoning for becoming a Lupinranger. : Sakuya Hikawa is portrayed by . ; : A candid, caring policewoman and Keiichiro's classmate from police school who aspired to become an officer like her grandfather and uses to transform into the pink-colored . As the most calm and collected member of the Patrangers, she is often forced to temper her teammates' personalities. Unlike Sakuya and Keiichiro, she is indifferent towards the Lupinrangers, as she is more focused on their origins and equipment. Despite her serious demeanor, she secretly has an obsession for plush toys and a fondness for adorable children. After learning the Lupinrangers' identities, she developed a desire to help them rather than arrest them. : Tsukasa Myojin is portrayed by . No√´l Takao is a mysterious 26-year-old special investigator from the GSPO's French headquarters who also operates as a gentleman thief. He was the adopted son of Ars√®ne Lupin and one of Back World's original inhabitants alongside Kogure, being the one who created the VS Changers and the VS Vehicles along with other items in the Lupin Collection.

It is generally referred to as Die sch√∂ne Melusine in modern concert programming and recordings, and is sometimes rendered in English as The Fair Melusine. The overture is loosely illustrative of aspects of the legend of Melusine, a water-nymph who marries Count Raymond, on the condition that he never enter her room on a Saturday (on which day she takes on the form of a mermaid). In the 19th century the story was familiar in Germany in the retelling by Ludwig Tieck (Melusina, 1800) and the poetic version of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√© (his Undine of 1811).Seaton (2004), p. 107. Mendelssohn denied close musical references to the story which critics, including Robert Schumann, believed they detected.Todd (2003), p. 289. When asked what the piece was about, Mendelssohn replied drily \\"Hmm ... a misalliance\\". Nevertheless, some aspects of the music have clear pictorial implications. The opening passage of string instrument arpeggios in rhythm anticipates the river music of the opening of Richard Wagner's 1854 opera Das Rheingold.Todd (2003), p. 288. The piece was written in 1834 as a birthday gift for Mendelssohn's sister Fanny. In a letter to her of 7 April 1834, he explains that he had picked on the subject after seeing Conradin Kreutzer's opera Melusina the previous year in Berlin. Kreutzer's overture, writes Mendelssohn > was encored, and I disliked it exceedingly, and the whole opera quite as > much: but not [the singer] Mlle. H√§hnel, who was very fascinating, > especially in one scene when she appeared as a mermaid combing her hair; > this inspired me with the wish to write an overture which the people might > not encore, but which would cause them more solid pleasure.Mendelssohn > (1864), pp. 31-32. The overture, which is broadly in sonata form, was first performed in London by the Philharmonic Society orchestra, conducted by Ignaz Moscheles, under the title Melusine, or the Mermaid and the Knight. The performance was received politely but not enthusiastically. Mendelssohn subsequently revised the piece, and it was published in the revised form in 1836.Todd (2003), pp. 288-289. A German contemporary reviewer commented that the Overture \\"does not try to translate the whole tale into musical language ... but only to conjure up for us, from the dreamworld of harmonic power, the happiness and unhappiness of two beings.\\"Cited in Brown (2003), p. 359. ==References== Notes Sources * Brown, Clive (2003).

Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York City, that opened on May 15, 2019. It utilizes the head house of the TWA Flight Center, designed in 1962 by the architect Eero Saarinen. The TWA Hotel project added two buildings on either side of the existing head house. It contains a total of 512 rooms, as well as conference space, several restaurants, and an aviation history museum. TWA Hotel was developed as part of a project to reuse the head house, which had stopped functioning as an air terminal in 2002. Morse Development developed the site along with MCR, which operates middle-to-budget hotels in the United States. It is the only hotel operating within the boundaries of JFK Airport. ==History== After the TWA Flight Center closed in 2002, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sought to redevelop or reuse the terminal. The main building, or head house, was protected from demolition; it had been made a New York City designated landmark in 1994, and subsequently was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The head house went largely unused until it was ultimately incorporated into an expansion of Terminal 5, which was completed in 2008 and is occupied by JetBlue Airways. In April 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that JetBlue and its partner, a hotel developer, were negotiating for the rights to turn the head house into a hotel. In July 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo confirmed that the Saarinen building would be converted into a new on-site hotel for the airport's passengers.  Construction  Groundbreaking took place on December 15, 2016, in a ceremony attended by Governor Cuomo, Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, and former employees of Trans World Airlines. A topping out ceremony for the hotel's first tower was held in December 2017, followed by the topping out of the second tower in March 2018. The next month, a model hotel room built inside a JFK Airport hangar was shown to the press. That October, a Lockheed Constellation L-1649 Starliner was shipped to the hotel site for conversion into a cocktail bar. The Starliner arrived at the hotel site at the end of November 2018. In March it was displayed in Times Square. The hotel started taking reservations in February 2019 in advance of a May opening. The hotel opened on May 15, 2019. ==Description== Front view of the TWA Hotel from a nearby parking lot; the 179x179px TWA Hotel lounge area Morse Development developed the site along with MCR, which operates middle-to-budget hotels in the United States. It is the only hotel operating within the boundaries of JFK Airport. Beyer Blinder Belle is the architectural firm responsible for renovating the terminal, while Lubrano Ciavarra Architects is the firm designing the two new buildings. Stonehill Taylor designed the hotel rooms, and INC Architecture and Design designed the underground event space with 45 meeting rooms and a meeting hall. Two buildings, north and south of the T5 terminal structure, encircle the original headhouse to the east. The two buildings contain a total of 512 rooms between them, as well as conference space, six to eight restaurants, and an aviation history museum. There is a rooftop infinity swimming pool and an observation deck with of floor space. The developers have a 75-year lease with the state. Many of the TWA Flight Center's original details, such as the custom ceramic floor tiles and the 486 variously-shaped window panels, were replaced with replicas of the originals. These details were intended to give the hotel a 1960s-era vibe, and include brass lighting, walnut-accented furnishings, and rotary phones. The hallways contain red carpeting, evocative of the color of the furniture in the original TWA lounge. However, the rooms also contain modern amenities such as blackout curtains and multiple-pane soundproof windows. The large departure board, a split-flap display made in Italy by Solari di Udine and which has been a feature of the building since the Flight Center's opening in 1962, was fully restored as part of the hotel project. The TWA Hotel also includes a cocktail lounge installed inside a preserved Lockheed L-1649 Starliner, the last model of the Lockheed Constellation line of airliners; the lounge is nicknamed \\"Connie\\". The hotel includes the Paris Caf√©, a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant, as well. During construction, a sales office and exhibition center, located on the 86th floor of One World Trade Center, was occasionally opened to the public. ==Critical reception== In the September 2-9, 2019, issue of Time, the hotel was placed on the magazine's list of \\"The World's Greatest Places of 2019\\". The hotel was featured as the cover story in Interior Design magazine's September 2019 issue. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *TWA Hotel and Lounge, Travel and Leisure Category:Hotels in Queens, New York Category:John F.

Wiseman (February 27, 1924 ‚Äì August 23, 2013) was an American electrical engineer and Military technology researcher best known for his developments of night vision technology. == Biography ==  Early Life and War Service  Robert Swern Wiseman was born February 27, 1924, in Robinson, Illinois, to Mary Jean Swern Wiseman and Wallace Paul Wiseman. He was a descendant of John Andrew Wiseman, a prominent nineteenth-century citizen of Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended the University of Illinois for Chemical Engineering for a brief time until volunteering in the Army Air Corps in 1943. He served in varying capacities all relating to communications and electronics through the conclusion of the war. He was later awarded the Bronze Star. Following his discharge from active military service, Wiseman attended the University of Illinois and earned his Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D. degrees.  Post War Career in Night Vision Research  Wiseman became the Chief of the Research and Photometric Section in the Night Vision Equipment Branch in the Corps of Engineers R&D; Laboratories in Fort Belvoir, Virginia in 1954. His work focused on improving night vision. By 1958, he was promoted to branch chief. In 1965, he became director of the newly created Night Vision Laboratory at Fort Belvior as well as at the Combat Surveillance & Target Acquisition Laboratory (C.S.& T.A.) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. His work assisted in the development of improved night vision technology utilized in later military actions.Private email from R. S. Wiseman to undisclosed recipients dated February 5, 2002 Wiseman was known as \\"Mr. Night Vision\\" to his colleagues. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter awarded Wiseman the rank of Distinguished Executive in the Senior Executive Service. In 1981, Wiseman retired from Civil Service and worked for Martin Marietta Aerospace in Orlando, Florida, where he fulfilled various management positions.  Personal Life and Death  Wiseman was married on February 1, 1947, to Norma Mae Woodard, also of Robinson, Illinois. On August 23, 2013, Wiseman passed away, survived by his wife of 66 years Norma Mae Wiseman, and by a daughter and several grandchildren. Funeral services with military graveside rites conducted by the Robinson VFW Post 459 and the American Legion Post, were held, and his remains were interred in Robinson New Cemetery, Robinson, Illinois. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Robinson, Illinois ","title":"Robert S.

(1932). Hydrodynamics. Cambridge university press.Batchelor, G. K. (2000). An introduction to fluid dynamics. Cambridge university press.. The theorem also has been studied by Diederik Korteweg in 1883Korteweg, D. J. (1883). XVII. On a general theorem of the stability of the motion of a viscous fluid. The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 16(98), 112-118. and by Lord Rayleigh in 1913Rayleigh, L. (1913). LXV. On the motion of a viscous fluid. The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 26(154), 776-786.. This theorem is, in fact, true for any fluid motion where the nonlinear term of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be neglected or equivalently when abla\\\\times abla\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}=0, where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} is the vorticity vector. For example, the theorem also applies to unidirectional flows such as Couette flow and Hagen‚ÄìPoiseuille flow, where nonlinear terms disappear automatically. ==Mathematical Proof== Let \\\\mathbf{u},\\\\ p and E=\\\\frac{1}{2}( abla\\\\mathbf{u}+( abla\\\\mathbf{u})^T) be the velocity, pressure and strain rate tensor of the Stokes flow and \\\\mathbf{u}',\\\\ p' and E'=\\\\frac{1}{2}( abla\\\\mathbf{u}'+( abla\\\\mathbf{u}')^T) be the velocity, pressure and strain rate tensor of any other incompressible motion with \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\mathbf{u}' on the boundary. Let u_i and e_{ij} be the representation of velocity and strain tensor in index notation, where the index runs from one to three. Consider the following integral, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int (e_{ij}'-e_{ij})e_{ij}\\\\ dV &= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\partial(u_i'-u_i)}{\\\\partial x_j} e_{ij}\\\\ dV \\\\end{align} where in the above integral, only symmetrical part of the deformation tensor remains, because the contraction of symmetrical and antisymmetrical tensor is identically zero. Integration by parts gives :\\\\int (e_{ij}'-e_{ij})e_{ij}\\\\ dV = \\\\int (u_i'-u_i)e_{ij} n_j\\\\ dA - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int (u_i'-u_i) ( abla^2 u_i)\\\\ dV. The first integral is zero because velocity at the boundaries of the two fields are equal. Now, for the second integral, since u_i satisfies the Stokes flow equation, i.e., \\\\mu abla^2 u_i = abla p, we can write :\\\\int (e_{ij}'-e_{ij})e_{ij}\\\\ dV = -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\mu} \\\\int (u_i'-u_i) \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\ dV. Again doing an Integration by parts gives :\\\\int (e_{ij}'-e_{ij})e_{ij}\\\\ dV = -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\mu} \\\\int p(u_i'-u_i) n_i \\\\ dA + \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\mu} \\\\int p\\\\frac{\\\\partial(u_i'-u_i)}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\ dV. The first integral is zero because velocities are equal and the second integral is zero because the flow in incompressible, i.e., abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}= abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}'=0. Therefore we have the identity which says, : \\\\int (e_{ij}'-e_{ij})e_{ij}\\\\ dV = 0. The total rate of viscous dissipation energy over the whole volume of the field \\\\mathbf{u}' is given by :D' = \\\\int \\\\Phi' dV = 2\\\\mu\\\\int e_{ij}'e_{ij}' \\\\ dV = 2\\\\mu\\\\int [e_{ij}e_{ij} + e_{ij}'e_{ij}'- e_{ij}e_{ij}]\\\\ dV and after a rearrangement using above identity, we get :D' = 2\\\\mu \\\\int [e_{ij}e_{ij} +(e_{ij}'-e_{ij})(e_{ij}'-e_{ij})]\\\\ dV If D is the total rate of viscous dissipation energy over the whole volume of the field \\\\mathbf{u}, then we have :D' = D + 2\\\\mu \\\\int (e_{ij}'-e_{ij})(e_{ij}'-e_{ij})\\\\ dV .

The app was developed by Toronto-based Carrot Insights, a certified B corporation founded in 2015. The app was first launched in British Columbia during March 2016, followed by Newfoundland and Labrador during June 2016, Ontario during February 2017, and the Northwest Territories only weeks before the app discontinued service in June 2019. Users could choose during sign-up whether they want Aeroplan, Scene, Petro-Points, More Rewards or Drop rewards points. RBC Rewards was also added as an option in June 2018. Survey points were paid for by the organization which created the survey and step points were paid for by the provincial government where the user lives. Carrot Rewards had also partnered with Heart & Stroke, Diabetes Canada and YMCA Canada. The app was later expanded to include questionnaires and surveys on energy conservation and financial literacy. In November 2018, an optional paid tier was added to the Carrot app, allowing users to receive bonus points for completing their goals. Carrot shut down on June 19, 2019, after their \\"funds eventually ran out and [they] could no longer be in business\\". However, in December 2019, social media accounts were updated with statuses saying ‚Äústay tuned‚Äù. In January 2020, Optimity bought Carrot Rewards and plans to relaunch the health app under a new model. == Criticism == Sylvia Jones, a Member of Provincial Parliament in Ontario criticized Carrot Insights for advertising a service to check credit scores in the app which was powered by Equifax Canada, leading to customer personal information being breached in the Equifax data breach.

Hill was born in Hyde Park, Massachusetts, but moved to Washington, D.C. early in her life. She was the daughter of John R. Hill, chief of the engraving division of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and was the sister of Louis A. Hill. A student of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, she also had lessons at the Acad√©mie Julian and the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris. Her instructors in France included Denys Puech and Jean Injalbert. Hill ran her own art school for many years, first on Dupont Circle and later on H Street, N.W. Beginning in 1922, she also taught alongside Catharine Carter Critcher, who also ran a school in Washington. Hill designed the decorations depicting Abraham Lincoln that were used as part of the decor on the American pavilion of the Exposition Universelle of 1900; they are currently unlocated, as are a number of her other known works, which were inventoried by the University of Delaware in 1985. During her career she showed work at the Paris Salon, the National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Maryland Institute, and the District of Columbia chapter of the National League of American Pen Women. In 1908 she showed several pieces at the Bauer-Folsom Gallery in New York City alongside paintings by Emil Carlsen. The following year she received the grand prize at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition; she also exhibited work at the Panama- Pacific International Exhibition in 1915. Hill was a charter member of the Arts Club of Washington, and was long associated with the Society of Washington Artists, with whom she exhibited from 1901 until 1932 and with whom she was serving as an officer at the time of her death. She was also a founder of the Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers Society of Washington, of which she served as president in the year of her death. Hill is buried in the family plot at Rock Creek Cemetery, where she has no marker of her own. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1935 deaths Category:American women sculptors Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:20th-century American women artists Category:Artists from Boston Category:Sculptors from Massachusetts Category:Artists from Washington, D.C.

She taught school in Buffalo, and worked at the Buffalo Times. In 1934 she married Buffalo News columnist Barnet Nover and, in 1936, moved with him to Washington, D.C. where he had been hired as a reporter for The Washington Post. In Washington, she earned a master's degree in education from George Washington University and taught at Washington's Murch Elementary School. In 1947, Barnet Nover was hired as Washington bureau chief of the Denver Post, a position he held until his 1971 retirement. Following retirement, Barnet Nover kept his foreign policy column going through syndication. ==Later life== After Barnet Nover's 1973 death, Naomi Nover attempted to take over his column; however, soon no newspapers were carrying it. Despite this, Nover continued to renew the White House press pass and congressional press gallery pass that had originally been issued to her late husband, attending White House press briefings and other media events in the Washington area. According to Foreign Policy, Nover \\"paid her own way on nearly every presidential trip abroad until her death in 1995 despite never actually doing any reporting\\". In 1976, Nover financially endowed the Washington Press Club's Barnet Nover Memorial Award, named after her late husband. According to Marlin Fitzwater, in 1988 Naomi Nover also donated a refrigerator in Barnet Nover's memory to the White House Briefing Room, which was subsequently used to store turkey sandwiches and soft drinks. Over a period of years the door of the Nover memorial refrigerator stopped functioning and rust developed on it, until it was finally removed sometime prior to 1995. In later life, she was said to have physically resembled George Washington. Relationship with other journalists Once, to deescalate a confrontation between Nover and a Chinese guard, Detroit News correspondent Gary Schuster displayed a U.S. dollar bill and implied Nover was the person pictured on it. Nover was known to be physically and verbally abusive towards journalists and others. While part of the press gaggle accompanying President of the United States Ronald Reagan to Xian, China, she pushed a Chinese guard with her umbrella who had blocked her path. The confrontation was deescalated when Detroit News correspondent Gary Schuster displayed a United States dollar to the guard and implied that the portrait of George Washington on it was, in fact, a portrait of Nover who was \\"a very important person\\". On another occasion, she publicly prayed for God to strike dead the Baltimore Suns Nancy Schwerzler, whose hair annoyed her. When Los Angeles Times photojournalist Bernie Boston positioned himself in a way that interfered with Nover's attempt to photograph Ronald Reagan and Mother Teresa, Nover began beating him with her umbrella \\"as President Reagan and Mother Teresa looked on in total amazement\\". On yet another occasion, during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Nover - responding to a perceived slight - assaulted the Baltimore Suns Carl Leubsdorf with her purse and then, when he retreated, gave chase. According to The Independent 's Andrew Stephen, he once arrived with George H.W. Bush's Air Force One party at Andrews Air Force Base and, after booking a taxi with four other journalists, Nover \\"simply got in and refused to budge before bursting into tears and loudly howling that the taxi was hers. A kindly Secret Serviceman carried her gently to another taxi while she screamed that he was killing her\\". Stephen would characterize Nover as \\"anything but a sweet old lady ... cursing at people, screeching and crying without any provocation, and continually beating innocent cameramen\\". Dan Froomkin, meanwhile, has described her as the \\"grand dame of White House eccentrics\\" while The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove would recall that Nover had a \\"habit of not taking notes at news conferences but instead demanding that colleagues tell her what was happening at the very moment something important was being said\\". In her autobiography, NBC News' Andrea Mitchell recalled that, on foreign presidential trips, \\"while we covered the president, she shopped\\", a fact that created logistical issues for other members of the press corps. Mitchell would say that \\"her shopping bags would block us from making a quick exit from a bus or plane\\". Nover's ire was not always reserved for her fellow reporters. During an incident in the United States Capitol, Nover - upon finding all toilet stalls in a public restroom occupied - physically expelled a woman from one so she herself could use it. During one trip abroad, a witness recalled her \\"plowing eight helpless Mexicans into a ditch\\" with her cane. Multiple attempts by some members of the White House Press Corps to have Nover's media credentials revoked produced no result. ==Legacy== Following her death, President Bill Clinton released a statement that read \\"Hillary and I were so saddened to learn of the death of Naomi Nover. Naomi's years of dedication to her craft, and her efforts to cover events here at the White House up until just a few months before her death, were a lesson to us all in hard work and the persistence of the human spirit\\". ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Writers from Buffalo, New York Category:Journalists from New York (state) Category:George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development alumni Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:Schoolteachers from Washington, D.C.

In 1843, he was approached by William Macready's rival Charles Kean to write a play for him. Browning took up the offer and finished the play in 1844. In March of that year, he read the finished play to Kean and his wife, Ellen Tree, and it was accepted for production. However, they could not promise its performance until 1845 and forced Browning not to publish it until then. Despite this request, the play was published five weeks later as the next number of his Bells and Pomegranates series. The play was finally produced in 1853 through the influence of Helen Faucit, who starred in the first production as the title character. ==Characters== * Colombe of Ravenstein ‚Äì Duchess of Juliers and Cleves * Sabyne ‚Äì Colombe's attendant * Adolf ‚Äì Colombe's attendant * Guibert ‚Äì a courtier * Gaucelme - a courtier * Maufroy ‚Äì a courtier * Clugnet ‚Äì a courtier * Valence ‚Äì advocate of Cleves * Prince Berthold ‚Äì claimant to the Duchy * Melchior ‚Äì Berthold's confidant ==Plot== Colombe has been Duchess of Juliers and Cleves for a year. It is her birthday and the anniversary of her coronation to the Duchy. Prince Berthold, the claimant to the throne, arrives and attempts to take over the Duchy as its rightful heir. The poor advocate of Cleves (Valance) tells Colombe the problems occurring in the city, but stands by her when Berthold attempts to take her throne. When called upon, however, Valance admits that Berthhold has the stronger claim. The prince suggests marriage as the solution, but does not pretend to love Colombe. Valance offers her his love instead, describing how it is better to have love than power, and she agrees. In choosing this, she relinquishes the Duchy's throne to Berthold. ==Critical analysis== Clyde de Loache Ryals argued that the play \\"shows that love and power cannot coexist\\" as Colombe chooses to be with her love interest Valence instead of keeping power in the Duchy. Describing it as \\"the closest that Browning wrote to political propaganda\\", Isobel Armstrong stated that the play can be taken as \\"anti-Corn Law\\" writing in the way that it promotes the welfare of the townspeople against the ruling class, here represented by the struggle between Valence and Colombe to rule the Duchy fairly. Arthur Symons also remarked on the way that Browning writes in a \\"deliberate and reflective\\" way. He noted that the play's focus is on the \\"purely personal and psychological bearings of the act\\", unlike Browning's other plays which appear \\"fiery\\" and \\"thrilling.\\" ==References== Category:1845 plays Category:Plays by Robert Browning ","title":"Colombe's Birthday"},{"id":"56134303","text":"Adeoye Adetunji (born 28 November 1957) is a Nigerian boxer.

Her remains were found on 14 February 2018 when Nordahl Lelandais, who admitted to killing her, led investigators to the area where he had disposed of the body. ==Investigation== Le Pont-de- Beauvoisin, Is√®re, the town where Ma√´lys de Araujo disappeared An Audi A3, like the one owned by Nordahl Lelandais Ma√´lys de Araujo was last seen at a wedding in Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin, Is√®re at approximately 3:00 am on 27 August 2017. After a DJ working at the wedding announced that she was missing, guests immediately started looking for her, and after an hour of searching, a police report was filed. In the months that followed, police interviewed 250 wedding guests. Along with local volunteers, they also searched the dense woodland around the area. Nordahl Lelandais, an ex-soldier who attended the wedding, was taken into custody in September 2017 after traces of De Araujo's DNA were found in his Audi A3 car. Two police dogs fell seriously ill after searching the car. Lelandais had reportedly used a strong detergent to clean it a few hours after De Araujo disappeared. A car wash CCTV camera recorded him cleaning the car for more than two hours. CCTV footage showed Lelandais leaving the wedding venue with a \\"small, frail figure in a white dress\\" in the passenger seat of his car shortly before De Araujo was reported missing. Lelandais' mobile phone was in airplane mode around this time, and then reconnected after 39 minutes, when he returned to the wedding alone. On 14 February 2018, Lelandais admitted to killing De Araujo, and led the police to where he had hidden her body. He told prosecutors he had killed her \\"involuntarily\\" but refused to elaborate further. The post-mortem established that the girl had suffered a fractured jaw, possibly from a violent blow to the face. Lelandais has been held in custody since 16 February 2018, in a psychiatric unit in a prison in Bron, just outside Lyon. ==Link to other cases== Prosecutors investigating De Araujo's death suspected that Lelandais is a serial killer. On 21 December 2017, he was charged with the killing of Arthur Noyer, a 23-year-old soldier who vanished after hitchhiking from a disco in Chamb√©ry on 12 April 2017. Investigators found that Lelandais's mobile phone had been in the same area at the same time as Noyer's. Lelandais's Audi A3 car was identified in the area on surveillance cameras. An analysis of his computer found he had searched for \\"decomposition of a human body\\" on the internet two weeks after Noyer disappeared. Lelandais admitted having given Noyer a lift but first denied any involvement in his death, before eventually admitting the killing on 29 March 2018. Other cases that may be linked to Lelandais include those of Jean-Christophe Morin and Ahmed Hamadou, who vanished from a festival in Fort de Tami√© in 2011 and 2012 respectively. ==See also== * Annecy shootings * Disappearance of Madeleine McCann * List of solved missing persons cases * Michel Fourniret ==References== Category:2008 births Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2017 crimes in France Category:August 2017 crimes in Europe Category:August 2017 events in France Category:Child abduction Category:Crime in Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes Category:Kidnappings in France Category:Missing person cases in France Category:Murdered French children Category:Violence against children ","title":"Death of Ma√´lys de Araujo"},{"id":"56134372","text":"Clelland F.

It is the 27th overall episode of the series and is written by Erik Mountain and directed by James Whitmore, Jr.. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on October 25, 2012. ==Plot== Riley Cavanaugh (Jonathan Tucker), an enforcer for an Irish mobster, becomes the next number when he betrays his boss and goes on the run with his lover, Annie (Liza J. Bennett), whom he was ordered to kill. Reese (Jim Caviezel) and Finch (Michael Emerson) debate the morality of trying to save a ruthless killer, but they soon need Riley's help when Annie is captured by bounty hunters hired by the mob. To keep Annie safe, Finch is forced to make a deal with Elias (Enrico Colantoni), who continues to run the biggest criminal organization in New York from behind bars, in exchange for a game of chess. Riley sacrifices his life in order to save Annie, an act Reese encourages her to interpret as proof of his love and a sign of his redemption. ==Reception== Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Triggerman\\" was seen by an estimated 14.03 million household viewers and gained a 2.9/8 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 13.93 million viewers with a 2.8/7 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night, beating Elementary but behind Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Grey's Anatomy, Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory. With Live +7 DVR factored in, the episode was watched by 17.40 million viewers with a 4.0 in the 18-49 demographics. Critical reviews \\"Triggerman\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"What shores this episode up is the first-ever meeting of Finch and Enrico Colantoni's Elias: A summit meeting of character-actor gods. Finch visits Elias in prison, to ask him to intervene and cancel out the million-dollar bounty that Massey has placed on the lovers' heads. (Naturally, being locked up has done nothing to diminish Elias' control over organized crime in the city.)\\" Tim Surette of TV.com wrote \\"Harold Finch and John Reese got back to business‚Äîand it was all business ‚Äî this week on Person of Interest. 'Triggerman' was the most rote episode of the season so far, ditching the high-altitude season-long plots for a purely self-contained episode that played around with our rigid notions of morality. But aside from that and a guest appearance from our old friend Elias, it was as plain as can be.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"In the end, it's that solid pacing and story, while giving the characters a chance to grow that keeps Person of Interest going and me looking forward to whatever is in store for next week.\\" == References External links== * \\"Triggerman\\" at CBS * * \\"Triggerman\\" at TV Guide * Category:Person of Interest (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Triggerman (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"56134566","text":"Deborah Griffin is a pioneer of the growth of women's rugby, both in England and globally.

It was known as one of the largest and most prestigious public schools for boys in New York City. ==History== Ward School No. 20 was built in 1847; in 1853, the ward schools in the city were renumbered, and the building became No. 35. The school had two departments: \\"Primary\\" and \\"Senior\\"; \\"Primary\\" was for boys only. Thomas Hunter began teaching at the school around 1850, when he arrived in the United States. He was made vice principal within four years, and was the school's principal from 1857 to 1869. He increased the student population from 300 to 1,000 students, and innovated a ban on corporal punishment, an act that the Board of Education later instituted in all New York public schools. Hunter's success at the school impressed William Wood of New York's Board of Education, who helped Hunter found what would become Hunter College. The school building, by Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, was a four- story brick building with about 30 classrooms, a playroom, and a basement, with a front and rear stairway as well as fire escapes. The building held about 1,000 students. Alterations and additions to the building were made in 1861. From 1897 to 1905, DeWitt Clinton High School occupied the school building. This was later followed by Julia Richman High School, and Washington Irving High School occupied it around 1912. ==Notable alumni== Graduates of the school formed the Thomas Hunter Association, an alumni association. * Frederick E.

Born on 2 January 1901, Huang learned the art of puppetry from his father and another puppeteer. He was also trained in beiguan music. Huang renamed his father's troupe Wuzhouyuan, and developed his own stories and characters, most notably Shi Yan-yun. At the start of his career, Taiwan was under Japanese rule, and Huang was limited to public performances that used the Japanese language and portrayed Japanese customs. However, Huang's secretly held private shows told traditional and historic Chinese tales, several of which he had read while in training. Over time, Huang became renowned as a national treasure. As his many students, including second son , formed their own theatre troupes in the 1950s, they ushered in the Golden Ray era, dominated by more elaborate shows in an attempt to compete with modernized entertainment mediums, such as comic strips, music, film, and television. Huang was awarded a in 2000, a in 2002, and presented with a presidential citation for lifetime achievement in 2004. Later that year, Huang's fifth son, Huang Feng-shih was named to the Legislative Yuan. Huang fell ill with pneumonia, and died of heart failure on 11 February 2007 in Huwei, Yunlin, aged 106. President Chen Shui-bian was one of thousands to attend Huang's funeral. He was posthumously featured on a Discovery Channel documentary series, Portrait: Taiwan, in November 2007.

Bovolos Shimon Dovid Cowen (born 7 September 1951)Profile of Shimon Dovid Cowen is an Australian rabbi and academic. He is known for his research on, and advocacy for, the Noahide Laws, on the basis of which, he has publicly opposed homosexuality, looser abortion laws and voluntary assisted dying legislation. He is affiliated with Chabad Hasidism, a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, and is the son of the former Governor General of Australia, Sir Zelman Cowen. == Education == Cowen was born in Melbourne, Victoria, concluding his secondary education in New South Wales before attending the Australian National University in Canberra. His studies took him to the University of Munich and Monash University, from which he received a PhD in social philosophy in 1984. For a number of years he was a member of the Kollel Menachem Lubavitch, a tertiary Rabbinic Institute, where he became director of community educational programs. He received rabbinic ordination from Rabbis Chaim Gutnick and She‚Äôar Yashuv Cohen He also taught in the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilization at Monash University. ==Institute for Judaism and Civilization== In 1998 he founded, and continues to direct, the Institute for Judaism and Civilization.http://www.ijc.com.au This institute was established to examine the ‚Äúinterface between Judaism and the arts, sciences and values of general society‚Äù. ==Universal Ethics== In addition to exploring the interface between Judaism and society and culture, Cowen has made a major focus of his work, the study of the universal ethics, at the root of the world religions, which he elaborated upon in his book on the Noahide laws, The Theory and Practice of Universal Ethics ‚Äì The Noahide Laws. Cowen has opposed Victoria's abortion laws that he claims is too liberal, and claims that these policies will \\"open the floodgates of barbarism\\". Victoria in 2017 introduced Australia‚Äôs first assisted suicide legislation, in which he saw further evidence of a loss of the moral compass of universal ethics and a new low point of civilization. He has also opposed homosexuality and euthanasia, as contraventions of the Noahide laws. He claims that these ethics, at the root of the world religions, should inform all of humanity's action and specifically be made known to political leaders and public political discourse. In the Victorian State election of 2014 he strongly advocated for a vote for one of the conservative minor parties, Family First, DLP or the Australian Christians. He opposed voting for the major parties based on their support for same sex marriage. He was also thanked by the DLP member of Victoria's Legislative Council, Rachel Carling- Jenkins during her maiden speech. == Views on homosexuality== Cowen is an open and vocal opponent of homosexuality, and more broadly campaigned against same sex marriage. The foundation premise of his book, Homosexuality, Marriage and Society, is that homosexuality has diverse causes (temperamental, psychological and cultural) extraneous to the essential person, the soul or conscience. Conscience is free to engage in a struggle with bodily impulse. He critiqued the move of the Victorian Government to appoint a Health Commissioner whose proposed job would, among other things, was intended to uproot ‚Äúconversion therapy‚Äù. He called this ban an attack on patient autonomy, for those who wanted to enter such a program..Even though almost all psychiatrists and psychiatric organisations oppose conversion therapy as dangerous and potentially harmful to the life of the individual, Cowen has cited the report of the American Psychological Association on ‚ÄúAppropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation‚Äù (2009) that ‚ÄúThere are no rigorously scientific sides of recent SOCE [Sexual Orientation change Efforts] that would enable us to make a definitive statement about whether recent SOCE is safe or harmful and for whom.‚Äù He also quotes a former President of the APA, Nicholas A. Cummings in 2013 testifying to significant successful outcomes of conversion therapy. Cowen does not have psychiatric qualifications. In 2010 the Victorian government established the Safe Schools Coalition, which was to be adopted nationally with the goals to reduce bullying of among others, non-heterosexual children. In 2012, Cowen opposed the ‚ÄúSafe Schools‚Äù program, as manipulating early childhood development against its ordinary, natural and moral norms, and that it would harm the normal sexual development of children.S. D. Cowen, ‚ÄúThe homosexual ‚Äòanti- bullying‚Äô program for schools‚Äù, Journal of the Australian Family Association, Vol. 32, No. 2, 2011 The publication of his views on this question brought on moves to have him removed from his appointment at Monash University and resulted in a public statement of the University dissociating itself from Cowen's views. After Cowen protested this as an abridgment of academic freedom, the University confirmed and promoted his appointment to that of a Senior Honorary Associate of the University. The university publicly distanced themselves from Cowen's statements In 2015 Cowen disseminated his opposition to same-sex marriage, also via his Monash University email account. The University, this time under a new Vice-Chancellor, who had placed the entire University behind same-sex marriage in the public debate, revoked Cowen's appointment claiming inappropriate of university email. On the grounds that the University‚Äôs decision constituted a prima facie violation of the Act of Parliament establishing Monash University, which set out as one of its objects ‚Äúpromoting critical and free enquiry, informed intellectual discourse and public debate within the University and in the wider society‚Äù ,Cowen pursued and then appealed a Freedom of Information decision about disclosure of the deliberations of the University leading to the dismissal. The presiding Magistrate found that ‚ÄúWhile I accept Dr Cowen's submission that freedom of academic expression and freedom to hold and practice religious beliefs in a university setting are important public interests, I reject his submission that the public interest requires that access should be given to the documents in contest in this proceeding.‚Äù At the September 25 2017 \\"LGBTI Mental Health Forum\\" event organised by the Jewish Community Council of Victoria, Cowen compared same sex attraction to bestiality and paedophilia, incest and theft. Cowen this representation of his comments as defamatory and claimed that he was \\"misunderstood\\" and apologised for the hurt his comments caused.\\"Rabbi sorry for comments at LGBTI forum - The Australian Jewish News\\".

Keady (born October 4, 1971) is an American activist, educator, and politician. == Early life and education == Keady was born in Neptune Township, NJ and grew up in Belmar, NJ. He attended the Christian Brothers Academy all- boys college preparatory school in Middletown Township, NJ. He later went on to receive a Master's degree in Pastoral Theology at St. John's University. == Activism ==  Nike Sweatshops  In 1998, Keady was conducting research about Nike's business practices at St. John's University, the school signed a $3.5 million deal with Nike, forcing all athletes and coaches to endorse Nike. Keady publicly refused to support Nike and was forced to resign his position as soccer coach. After resigning, Keady continued to research the conditions in Nike's Sweatshops. He traveled to Indonesia and for a month lived among the Nike factory workers, surviving on the $1.25 per day wage the workers earn. Keady's efforts were recognized on many media outlets, including CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, MSNBC, CNN, HBO Sports, ESPN, the ABC, the BBC, NPR, WBAI, as well as in the NY Times, Newsday, Sports Illustrated, the Daily News, Daily Kos and many other local radio programs and print outlets. He offers an educational workshops called \\"Beyond the Swoosh\\" where he shares his experiences living with Nike's factory workers and his decade long effort to end sweatshop abuses. After a decade of activism, Indonesian Nike supplier PT Nikomas Gemiland repaid 4437 production workers for 600,000 of forced unpaid labor. In September 2018, Nike and Keady were in the news again over a controversial ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick, famed football player and social justice protester. Keady was asked to voice his views regarding Nike's stance on social justice in the United States while the company has a history of social justice controversies globally.  Hurricane Sandy  In 2012, Keady volunteered to lead recovery efforts in his hometown of Belmar, NJ, after Hurricane Sandy. Two years later, Governor Chris Christie visited the town to publicize state recovery efforts. Keady interrupted the press conference to voice his complaints about the pace of recovery. Christie told him to ‚Äúsit down and shut up.‚Äù The encounter gained national media attention. Keady appeared on several news networks explaining of the $1.1 billion in federal funding allocated to the program, state data showed roughly $530 million has been awarded and more than $222 million has been disbursed. Over the three months following the confrontation, more recovery funds were disbursed than in the prior three years.  Syrian Refugee Crisis  In 2015, Keady spent 10 days in Lesbos, Greece to help refugees from war-torn Middle Eastern countries find new lives in the west. Keady said he went to Greece when he saw rising anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiment in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks. \\"It‚Äôs not just a political issue; these are people,\\" said Keady. \\"These are people that just want a better life. They left areas that have been ravaged by war.\\"  Hurricane Maria  In 2017, after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Keady made multiple humanitarian trips to provide aid to the people of the island. == Legislative career ==  Asbury Park City Council  In 2005, Keady served on the Asbury Park City Council. He ran with two other city residents but he was the only one on his team to be elected.

It was formerly placed in the genus Luciola. The larvae are aquatic and live in rice paddies. The genome of Aquatica lateralis was sequenced in 2018. ==Taxonomy== Victor Motschulsky described this species as Luciola lateralis from Dauria, Siberia in 1860. In 2010, Fu, Ballantyne and Lambkin transferred four Luciola species, including lateralis, to the new genus Aquatica. The Japanese name of A. lateralis is \\"heike-botaru\\", which may derive from The Tale of Heike, a 14th-century Japanese novel, or the Heike clan, which lost the 12th-century Genpei War. (Another, larger firefly species, Luciola cruciata, has the Japanese common name \\"genji-botaru\\", a possible reference to the Genji clan, the winners in the Genpei War). ==Description== The male is long and wide. The female is long and wide. The body is elongate oval. The pronotum is reddish pink or yellowish, with a central brown band, and the elytra are dark brown. The male has a brown and yellow venter, and that of the female is brown, yellow and reddish pink. The oblong aedeagal sheath, about in length, and the male genitalia, long, are asymmetric. The larva is soft, having gills and defensive organs. ==Distribution and habitat== A. lateralis is found in eastern Siberia, the Kuril Islands, Japan (including all four main islands) and Korea. Its presence in China is unsubstantiated. Larvae live in rice paddies. Adults are found from April to November; their numbers are greatest from June to August. ==Behaviour== The larvae are aquatic, crawling at the bottom of the water. Third and fourth instar larvae overwinter in soils and stubble. In Hokkaido and Korea, individuals often mature in more than one year; on Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku, individuals usually mature in less than one year. The larvae and adults emit yellowish lights, and the dim glow of the eggs and pupae is green. The male emits flashes while searching for the female, whose flashes attract the male to a leaf from it. The male then emits a twinkling flash. Flashing continues, and then they copulate. Green, yellow and red artificial flashes all attract the male. In Hokkaido, there is longer than one second between flashes. In other areas of Japan and in Korea, there is about half a second. ==References== Category:Lampyridae Category:Bioluminescent insects Category:Insects of Russia Category:Insects of Japan Category:Insects of Korea Category:Beetles described in 1860 ","title":"Aquatica lateralis"},{"id":"56135071","text":"Hazel is a surname.

At Cornell University, from which he graduated in 1919, he began using the last name Nover and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. The following year, he received a Master of Arts degree from the same university. ==Career== Nover began his career as a reporter for the Buffalo Evening News in 1920, a position he would hold for the next 16 years while simultaneously lecturing on international relations at the University of Buffalo. As a reporter for the Buffalo Evening News, Nover traveled extensively in Europe and Asia and received honorable mention for the 1930 Pulitzer Prize. In 1936 Nover was hired as a reporter for The Washington Post, where he covered foreign policy. His 1939 article \\"British Surrender ‚Äì a Munich for the Holy Land\\", which compared the White Paper of 1939 to the Munich Agreement, was inserted into the Congressional Record by then United States Senator Harry Truman. For a three-year period, beginning in 1944, he hosted the nationally syndicated radio program Washington Views and Interviews simultaneous to his work with The Washington Post. In 1947, Nover left The Washington Post to accept an assignment as Washington bureau chief of The Denver Post, a position he held until his 1971 retirement.

He died at Massachusetts General Hospital April 15, 1973, aged 74. ==Legacy== In 1976, Naomi Nover financially endowed the Washington Press Club's Barnet Nover Memorial Award, named after her late husband. According to Marlin Fitzwater, in 1988 Naomi Nover also donated a refrigerator in Barnet Nover's memory to the White House Briefing Room, which was subsequently used to store turkey sandwiches and soft drinks. Over a period of years the door of the Nover memorial refrigerator stopped functioning and rust developed on it, until it was finally removed sometime prior to 1995. ==References== Category:The Washington Post people Category:1899 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Cornell University alumni Category:The Denver Post people Category:Journalists from New York City Category:DeWitt Clinton High School alumni Category:Jewish American journalists Category:University at Buffalo faculty ","title":"Barnet Nover"},{"id":"56135080","text":"The following is a list of women's international rugby union matches with non- test status.
