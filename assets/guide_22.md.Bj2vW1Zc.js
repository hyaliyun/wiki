She graduated from Los Gatos High School in Los Gatos, California and studied at San Francisco State University, graduating in May 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts in film and sculpture. She spent the following year backpacking, primarily in South Asia, and was involved in a number of art projects. ==Career== ===MythBusters=== Byron was a cast member on MythBusters from 2004 to 2014. Along with fellow cast members Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara she was part of what is commonly referred to as \\"The Build Team\\" or B Team. This Build Team worked with Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman to test the plausibility of various myths throughout their tenure with the show. She and the others also hosted their own segments. She became involved in the show after persistently showing up at Hyneman's M5 Industries workshop in a desire to get hired by his company. She and the other Build Team members were given a more prominent role beginning with the show's second season. Not having had a long history in show business, Byron at first found it difficult to act naturally with this more visible position but gradually became more accustomed to it. During the second half of the 2009 season, Byron was on maternity leave and was temporarily replaced by Jessi Combs. From 2010‚Äì2011, Byron had her own show, Head Rush, on the Science Channel, geared toward science education and teens. Byron has also hosted the 2010 and 2011 editions of Large, Dangerous Rocket Ships for the Science Channel. She and Belleci made a guest appearance on the October 3, 2012 episode of the Discovery series Sons of Guns. They test-fired some of the weapons in the Red Jacket shop and watched as the staff re-tested a myth previously busted by the Build Team: that a propane tank could explode if struck by a bullet. She left the show in 2014. Byron and Belleci hosted coverage of Pumpkin Chunkin on the Science Channel from 2011 to 2014. In 2015, Byron and Belleci hosted Thrill Factor, a new show for the Travel Channel. ===White Rabbit Project=== Byron, along with Imahara and Belleci, hosted the Netflix production White Rabbit Project, released on Netflix on December 9, 2016. The series focused on unusual aspects from history and pop culture. ===Crash Test World=== Byron is currently host of the series Crash Test World. The first season of six episodes airs on Discovery Channel in late 2020. ==Personal life== Byron married artist Paul Urich in March 2006. They have a daughter. In May 2020, Byron described herself as a \\"single mom\\" in an interview. She was previously a vegetarian, but now describes herself as pescetarian. Byron continues to create art, including paintings created by igniting gunpowder. In 2018 she published a memoir Crash Test Girl, with HarperOne. ==ReferencesCategory:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Television personalities from San Francisco Category:San Francisco State University alumni Category:People from Los Gatos, California ","title":"Kari Byron"},{"id":"3256113","text":"ATFS may refer to: * Artificial transcription factor, an example of a chimeral protein designed to target and modulate gene transcription. * Association of Track and Field Statisticians, an international organisation run by volunteers whose goal is to collect and disseminate the statistics of Track and Field Athletics. *After The Forking Show, the explicit podcast created by the team from Spoonman's Classic Rock Show. *American Tree Farm System, A flourishing network of people who care deeply about the environment.

The screenplay, by Arnold Schulman, won the Writers Guild of America Award.. The story's title alludes to a phonograph record played by the brother of MacGraw's character, nostalgically recalling his athletic career at Ohio State in Columbus. The film was essentially MacGraw's film debut, as she had previously had only a \\"bit part\\" in the previous year's A Lovely Way to Die. ==Plot== Neil Klugman is an intelligent, working-class army veteran and a graduate of Rutgers University who works as a library clerk. He falls for Brenda Patimkin, a wealthy Radcliffe student who is home for the summer. They meet by the swimming pool at Old Oaks Country Club in Purchase, New York, a private club that Neil visits as a guest of his cousin Doris. They face obstacles from Brenda's family (particularly her mother), due to differences in class and assimilation into the American mainstream. Brenda's family are nouveau riche, their money coming from the successful plumbing supply business owned and run by her father. Brenda herself is old enough to remember \\"being poor\\". Other conflicts include propriety and issues related to premarital sex and the possibility of pregnancy and Mrs. Patimkin's envy of her daughter's youth. After a few dates, Brenda persuades her father to invite Neil to stay with them for two weeks. This angers her mother, who feels that she should have been asked instead. Neil enjoys being able to sneak into Brenda's room at night but has misgivings over her entitled outlook, which is reflected in her spoiled and petulant younger sister, and her naive brother Ron, who misses the hero worship he enjoyed as a star basketball player at Ohio State University. Neil is astonished when Brenda reveals that she does not take birth control pills or use any other precautions to avoid pregnancy. She angrily rejects Neil's concerns. He prepares to leave, but she decides to persuade him to stay by agreeing to get a diaphragm. At the end of his stay, Neil attends Ron's wedding to Harriet, who was his college sweetheart from Ohio. Brenda returns to Radcliffe in the fall, keeping in touch by telephone. She invites Neil to come up to spend a weekend at a Boston hotel. However, once they are in the hotel room, Brenda tells Neil she just received letters telling her that her mother found her diaphragm and that her parents know about their affair. They argue, with Neil asking why she left it to be found unless she wanted it to happen. Siding with her parents, Brenda ends the affair as abruptly as she allowed it to commence. Neil walks out of the hotel, leaving her alone in the room. ==Cast== * Richard Benjamin as Neil Klugman * Ali MacGraw as Brenda Patimkin * Jack Klugman as Ben Patimkin * Nan Martin as Mrs. Ben Patimkin * Michael Meyers as Ron Patimkin * Lori Shelle as Julie Patimkin * Monroe Arnold as Uncle Leo * Kay Cummings as Doris Klugman * Sylvie Strause as Aunt Gladys * Ilona Simon as Gloria Feldman * Royce Wallace as Carlotta, the African- American cook and housekeeper at the Patimkin home. * Mari Gorman as Simp (Laura Simpson Sockaloe) ==Reception== ===Box-office=== The film earned an estimated $10.5 million in rentals at the North American box office, making it one of the most popular movies of the year.\\"Big Rental Films of 1969\\", Variety, 7 January 1970 p 15. ===Critical response=== Variety magazine lauded the film upon its release, writing, \\"This adaptation of Philip Roth's National Book Award-winning novella is sometimes a joy in striking a boisterous mood, and otherwise handling the action.

They stand erect like penguins and, rather than waddling, they run. The females usually lay about 300 to 350 eggs a year or more, depending whether they are from exhibition or utility strains. They were found on the Indonesian islands of Lombok, Java and Bali where they were 'walked' to market and sold as egg-layers or for meat. These ducks do not fly and only rarely form nests and incubate their own eggs. They run or walk, often dropping their eggs wherever they happen to be. Duck-breeders need to house their birds overnight or be vigilant in picking up the eggs to prevent them from being taken by other animals. The ducks vary in weight between . Their height (from crown to tail tip) ranges from in small females to about in the taller males. The erect carriage is a result of a pelvic girdle that is situated more towards the tail region of the bird compared to other breeds of domestic duck. This structural feature allows the birds to walk or \\"quickstep\\", rather than waddle, as seen with other duck breeds. Indian Runner ducks have a long, wedge-shaped head. The bill blends into the head smoothly being as straight as possible from bean to the back of the skull. The head is shallower than what is seen with most other breeds of duck. This effect gives a racy appearance, a breed trait. Eye placement is high on the head. Indian Runners have long, slender necks that smoothly transition into the body. The body is long, slim but round in appearance. The eggs are often greenish-white in color. Indian Runners have tight feathering. Drakes have a small curl on the tip of their tails, while hens have flat tails. It's difficult to determine their sex until they are fully mature. They often swim in ponds and streams, but they are likely to be preoccupied foraging in grassy meadows for worms, slugs, even catching flies. They appreciate open spaces but are happy in gardens from which they cannot fly and where they make much less noise than call ducks. Only females quack and drakes are limited to a hoarse whisper. Compared to big table ducks, they eat less grain and pellet supplements. A family of Indian Runner ducks, clearly showing their upright posture ==Origins of the breed== The Indian Runner ducks are domesticated waterfowl that live in the archipelago of the East Indies. There is no evidence that they came originally from India itself. Attempts by British breeders at the beginning of the twentieth century to find examples in the subcontinent had very limited success. Like many other breeds of waterfowl imported into Europe and America, the term 'Indian' may well be fanciful, denoting a loading port or the transport by 'India-men' sailing ships of the East India Company. Other misnamed geese and ducks include the African goose, the black East Indian duck and the Muscovy duck. The Runner became popular in Europe and America as an egg-laying variety towards the end of the nineteenth century largely as a result of an undated pamphlet called The India Runner: its History and Description published by John Donald of Wigton between 1885Edward Brown, Poultry Breeding and Production, Vol. 3, 1929 and 1890.J.A.Coutts, The Indian Runner Duck, 1927 Donald's publication is advertised briefly in The Feathered World, 1895, under the title of \\"The Indian Runner Duck\\". Donald describes the pied variety and gives the popular story of the importation into Cumbria (Northwest England) by a sea captain some fifty years earlier. The breed is unusual not only for its high egg production but also for its upright stance and variety of color genes, some of which are seen in seventeenth century Dutch paintings.By the d‚ÄôHondecoeter family and others. See the Indian Runner Duck Association website: Other referencesBy Darwin (1868), Zollinger (Journal of the Indian Archipelago, 1851) and Wallace (The Malay Archipelago, 1856 note) to such domestic ducks use the names 'Penguin Ducks' and 'Baly Soldiers'. Harrison Weir's Our Poultry (1902) describes the Penguin Ducks belonging to Mr Edward Cross in the Surrey Zoological Gardens between 1837‚Äì38. These may well have been imported by the 13th Earl of Derby.By Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Rudolph, Indian Runner Duck Association Year Book Darwin describes them (1868) as having elongated 'femur and meta-tarsi', contrary to Tegetmeier's assertions.Tegetmeier, The Poultry Book (1867), which emphasizes the 'extreme shortness of the femora'. The Cumbrian importations, according to Matthew Smith in 1923,In Coutts (1927) included completely fawn Runners and completely white Runners as well as the pied (fawn-and-white and grey-and-white) varieties. The most successful attempt to import fresh blood lines was by Joseph Walton between 1908 and 1909. Accounts of these ventures can be found in Coutts (1927) and Ashton (2002). Walton shipped in birds from Lombok and Java, revolutionizing the breeding stock which, according to Donald, had become badly mixed with local birds.John Donald, The India Runner: its History and Description (1885‚Äì90): 'very few of the original type are now to be found. Further importations by Miss Chisholm and Miss Davidson in 1924 and 1926See Ashton (2002) pp.105‚Äì122. continued to revive the breed. ==Development== Pure breed enthusiasts, exhibitors and show judges wanted to establish standard descriptions. Standards were drawn up in by the Waterfowl Club in England (1897)Digby, Henry. How to make ¬£50 a Year by Keeping Ducks. 1897. and America (1898) for the pied color varieties. These were largely the same until 1915 when the two countries diverged. The American Poultry Association chose a variety with blue in the genotype whilst the English Poultry Club Standard kept to the pure form described by Donald in his original pamphlet. Other colors followed making use of black genes brought in by some of Walton's birds. These were to produce black, chocolate and Cumberland blue. Later were developed the mallard, trout, blue trout, and apricot trout versions.Detailed descriptions of these are to be found in British Waterfowl Standards (BWA 2008). Slightly different names and descriptions can be found in American and German standards. An account of the influence of the Indian Runner Duck Club (founded in 1906), particularly the input by John Donald, Joseph Walton, Dr J. A. Coutts and Matthew Smith, can be found in Ashton (2002). The most profound impact of the Indian Runners was on the development of the modern 'light duck' breeds. Before 1900, most ducks were bred for the table. Aylesbury and Rouen ducks were famous throughout the nineteenth century, and these were supplemented or replaced, after 1873‚Äì74, by importation from China of the Pekin duck. As soon as the Indian Runners became fashionable, a demand for egg-layers and general purpose breeds developed. Using Runners crossed to Rouens, Aylesburys and Cayugas (the large black American breed), William Cook produced his famous Orpington Ducks. Mrs Campbell crossed her fawn-and-white Runner duck to a Rouen drake to create the Campbell ducks introduced in 1898. Later, she introduced wild mallard blood and managed to create the most prolific egg-layer, the Khaki Campbell (announced in 1901). Other breeds followed, some of which emerged as direct mutations of the Khaki Campbell, along with crosses back to Indian Runners, the most famous being the Abacot Ranger (known in Germany as the Streicher) and the Welsh Harlequin. Currently there are eight varieties of Indian Runner recognized with the American Poultry Association. They are, in order of recognition, Fawn & White, White, Penciled, Black, Buff, Chocolate, Cumberland Blue, and Gray. ==Color breeding== Indian Runner ducks and Pekins brought in unusual plumage colour mutations. These included the dusky and restricted mallard genes, light phase, harlequin phase, blue and brown dilutions, as well as the famous pied varieties named by the geneticist F. M. LancasterF. M. Lancaster, The inheritance of plumage colour in the common duck (1963), and mutations and major variants in domestic ducks in Poultry Breeding and Genetics edited by R. D. Crawford (1990) as the 'Runner pattern'. Much of the proliferation of new colour varieties in breeds of domestic duck begins with the importation of these oriental ducks. Original research by R. G. Jaap (1930s) and F. M. Lancaster has allowed breeders to understand the effect of genotypes in managing and creating colour varieties. Simplified information can be found in writings by Dave Holderread, and Mike and Chris Ashton.Storey‚Äôs Guide to Raising Ducks (Holderread, 2001); The Domestic Duck (2001) and Colour Breeding in Domestic Ducks (2007) (C. and M.

It was popular among lesser, middle and even some higher nobility, and it also enjoyed the support of the Polish king. In Polish, the movement is variously known as ruch egzekucyjny, egzekucja praw (\\"execution [enforcement] of the laws\\"), or egzekucja d√≥br (\\"execution of property\\"). The movement sought the revendication of public and state lands which were illegally held by various magnates. The followers of the movement were known as populary≈õci (\\"popularists\\"), or zamoyszczycy (\\"Zamoyskites\\", after the main movement supporter Jan Zamoyski). The movement opposed the abuse of the existing laws by the higher nobility (magnates), and demanded the \\"execution\\", or actual implementation, of already existing legislation. Major supporters of the movement included: * Chancellor Jan Zamoyski, * Sejm marshal Miko≈Çaj Sienicki, * Sejm marshal Rafa≈Ç Leszczy≈Ñski (ancestor of King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, grandfather of Primate of Poland Wac≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski), * Politicians like Hieronim Ossoli≈Ñski, Jakub Ostror√≥g, Jan Ponƒôtowski. * Portions of the movement's program received the support of philosophers such as Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski and Jan ≈Åaski or writers like Augustinus Rotundus. National Museum in Warsaw. The composition presents the vision of the Polish state standing by the King and the Church, in line with the popular lex-rex rule of the executionist movement. The movement's goal was to reform the country, increase the rights of the lesser and middle nobility in parliament (Sejm) at the expense of the magnates, the priesthood and to a lesser extent, the monarch. The Executionist movement succeeded in having some of its demands implemented. However, by the early 17th century it declined and lost power before having attained most of its goals. The latter are largely viewed by modern historians as having been potentially salutary, had they been implemented. The Execution movement's demands included: * Respect for sejmik constitutions (legal acts), and codification of the laws (hence, \\"execution of the laws\\"), * Return of crown lands (\\"kr√≥lewszczyzny\\"), often illegally held by the magnates, to the king (hence, \\"execution of lands\\"), * Increasing the power of the Sejm (parliament); thus, the law of \\"Nihil novi\\", * Respect for the Incompatibilitas law of 1504, which specified that some offices of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth cannot be held together at the same time by a single person. * Respect for the rule of residence, which stipulated that certain district offices might be held only by a person who maintained a residence in a particular district (territory, county). Additional demands and ideologies at various times also included: * No new laws were to be passed without the approval of the Sejm. * The executionists favored a strong central authority. * In the view of the executionists the king was to represent the monarchy, the Senate the magnates and the Sejm the democracy of the nobility. Out of these three they saw the last one as the organ which should be made into the dominant power in the country. * The removal of the privileges of the clergy. This included demands for the taxation of the church, the secularization of church lands, limitations on ecclesiastical jurisdiction in regard to disputes over the tithe or other economic matters and a review of donations made to the church. Payments * They sought a tighter union with Lithuania, and an end to the autonomy of Prussia. * A reform of the public finances. * An organization of a standing army. * An affirmation of religious freedom. * Complete removal of tariffs on imports and limits on internal tolls. * The liquidation of medieval guilds, a ban on land ownership by non- szlachta, greater economic freedom for Jews at the expanse of the burgers, including access to city and town markets, and a limit on church appointments of non-szlachta. * A reform and modernization of the judicial system. == See also == * ≈Åaski's Statute * Patriotic Party * Zebrzydowski Rebellion == References == * Violetta Urbaniak, Zamoyszczycy bez Zamoyskiego (Zamoyszczycy without Zamoyski), Wydawnictwo DiG, Warszawa 1995 Category:16th century in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Category:Legal history of Poland Category:16th century in Poland ","title":"Executionist movement"},{"id":"3256183","text":"The 3 arrondissements of the Haute-Loire department are: # Arrondissement of Brioude, (subprefecture: Brioude) with 111 communes.

He was a match arranger, goalkeeper and team captain for Queen's Park during the 1860s until 1874. A letter of his, dated 1868, is the oldest surviving letter pertaining to association football. He was also the first goalkeeper to captain an international side. ==Personal details== Gardner was born in Glasgow and brought up in the city. Pictures show that he wore a full beard. He was evidently very well educated. According to a contemporary cartoon, he may have relieved the boredom of long periods of inactivity by smoking his pipe on the field. He married Mary Arrol, cousin of the engineer Sir William Arrol, and they had three sons. He found work on Sir William Arrol's Forth Bridge project at South Queensferry, where he died, before he was 40, on 28 February 1887. Gardner was one of the original members of Queen's Park Football Club. He was originally a forward but switched to goalkeeper in 1872. Apart from four goals conceded in an international match in 1873, Gardner did not concede a goal until January 1874. This is considered phenomenal when one considers that he may not have been allowed to use his hands for much of that time, and that goalkeeping technique would have been in a primitive state. However, although nineteenth century goalkeeping seems to have been almost entirely \\"on the goal line\\", the basic stalwart technique of \\"narrowing the angle\\" seems to have been used by Gardner. He was almost certainly the best goalkeeper of his time. ==International career== Gardner was instrumental in arranging the first official international football match, Scotland versus England in 1872, called by many \\"the most important game in football history\\", because the English played a style based on individual dribbling, while the Scots played a passing style; and the rules for the match were standardised (the Scottish rules). The Scottish side for this match consisted entirely of Queen's Park players. Robert Gardner was Scotland's first ever team captain, who selected his team, and kept goal during most of the 0‚Äì0 draw, although during the early stages of the second half he swapped places with forward Robert Smith and played part of the match up front before returning to the goal. Gardner kept goal and captained Scotland against England the following year. The game was won 4‚Äì2 by England in London against a Scottish side which was partly composed of English-based players because the Scottish Football Association budget only stretched to the rail fares of seven players. Gardner's switch of club to Clydesdale in 1874 lost him the Scottish captaincy when the Queen's Park players refused to be captained by a player from another club. He still kept goal for Scotland against England for the following two years, with a 2‚Äì1 win and a 2‚Äì2 draw. Gardner kept goal and captained Clydesdale in the first Scottish cup final in 1874, playing against Queen's Park. Although his side lost 2‚Äì0, contemporary accounts of the match home in on Gardner's magnificent display of goalkeeping against his old club. In 1878 he made his fifth and last appearance as Scotland's last line of defence, and had the satisfaction of taking part in Scotland's 7‚Äì2 drubbing of England. Gardner also served as referee, handling the first international match between Scotland and Wales on 25 March 1876, and was a founding member of the Scottish Football Association serving as its President from 1877 to 1878. ==References== == External links == * Category:1847 births Category:1887 deaths Category:Footballers from Glasgow Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Queen's Park F.C. players Category:Clydesdale F.C. players ","title":"Robert Gardner (footballer)"},{"id":"3256224","text":"The 3 arrondissements of the Hauts-de-Seine department are: # Arrondissement of Antony, (subprefecture: Antony) with 11 communes.

His father was a railway engineer. He studied law in Rostock and Munich, and entered the profession as a jurist in April 1932. He held membership in the Sturmabteilung (Nazi stormtroopers) between 1932 and 1934. In 1933, he joined the Nazi Party. He was a vocal anti-semite. From 1937, he was a diplomat with the German Foreign Office, serving at the German embassy in Montevideo, Uruguay until May 1940. In 1940, he was selected to lead Referat D III, or Judenreferat, of Ribbentrop's Foreign Affairs Ministry. His direct superior was Nazi diplomat Martin Luther. It was during his tenure in this office, throughout the spring and summer of 1940, that Rademacher initiated the Madagascar Plan, which sought to forcibly deport all of Europe's Jews to the island of Madagascar. He clashed briefly with Adolf Eichmann over organizational control of the plan, which would shortly be abandoned amidst Germany's changing fortunes in World War II. Rademacher as a participant in the meeting on the Final Solution of the Jewish Question on 6 March 1942 at the Reich Main Security Office In October 1941, he was responsible for mass deportations and executions of Serbian Jews. He also had a hand in the deportation of Jews from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. After his visit to Belgrade, Rademacher filed an expense claim stating that the official purpose of the trip was to \\"liquidate the Jews.\\" In 2010, the German Foreign Ministry released an 880-page report on the diplomats of the Third Reich entitled The Ministry and the Past (Das Amt und die Vergangenheit), which mentioned that particular expense claim, bringing Rademacher a degree of latter-day notoriety. In 1943, Rademacher became embroiled in Luther's attempted coup to oust Ribbentrop. He was dismissed from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and sent to fight in the navy as an officer for the remainder of the war, ending up with Admiral Doenitz' cypher-breaking unit at Flensburg-M√ºrwik under the command of Captain Kupfer. Immediately following the war this unit was put at the disposal of Sefton Delmer's news agency in Hamburg. Rademacher was arrested by British military police in November 1945, who ultimately released him. He was eventually brought to trial in West Germany in February 1952 for the murders he supervised in Serbia. However, with the aid of Nazi sympathizers, he fled to Syria in September of that year while released on bail. A German court convicted him in absentia for the murder of Serbian Jews, and sentenced him to 3 years and 5 months imprisonment. ==Later years== In 1962, Israeli spy Eli Cohen delivered a letter bomb to Rademacher in a failed assassination attempt. In 1963, he was arrested in Syria on charges of spying, but was released in 1965 due to ill health. He returned voluntarily to West Germany on 30 November 1966, where he was arrested at the Nuremberg airport. Reportedly ill at the time, he was taken to a prison hospital in Bayreuth, while awaiting prosecution in Bamberg.\\"Former top Nazi held on return from Syria,\\" Jerusalem Post, 2 October 1966, pg. 2. He was again convicted of war crimes and sentenced to five and half years' imprisonment. However, his sentence was never carried out, the court having considered it already served. In 1971, a German high court in Karlsruhe overruled this judgment against Rademacher, and ordered a new trial for his crimes during World War II. He died on 17 March 1973, before proceedings began. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *\\"Historian Calls Wartime Ministry A 'Criminal Organization'\\" Spiegel Online interview of historian Eckart Conze (2010) Category:1906 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Ambassadors of Germany to Uruguay Category:People from Neustrelitz Category:History of Madagascar Category:Nazi Party officials Category:People from Mecklenburg-Strelitz Category:Holocaust perpetrators in Yugoslavia Category:Planning the Holocaust Category:Sturmabteilung personnel Category:Jewish Serbian history Category:Serbia in World War II Category:People of the Federal Intelligence Service Category:German people convicted of crimes against humanity ","title":"Franz Rademacher"},{"id":"3256235","text":"Lorient or L'Orient may refer to: *Lorient, a town in Brittany, France **FC Lorient, a French professional football league team *Lorient, Saint Barth√©lemy *L'Orient, Switzerland, a village forming part of the municipality of Le Chenit in Vaud, Switzerland *French ship L'Orient (1791), a French warship, sunk at the Battle of the Nile *Raid on Lorient, a 1746 British attempt to capture the town during the War of the Austrian Succession == See also == * Orient (disambiguation) ","title":"Lorient (disambiguation)"},{"id":"3256239","text":"The 4 arrondissements of the Ille-et-Vilaine department are: # Arrondissement of Foug√®res-Vitr√©, (subprefecture: Foug√®res) with 106 communes.

The oldest known photograph of the Mathematical School. Free School Lane is in the distance. Taken c 1880. Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School (SJWMS) is a boys' grammar school with academy status in Rochester, Kent, also referred to either as Rochester Math or The Math School. The school was founded by the statesman Sir Joseph Williamson (1633-1701), lord of the nearby Manor of Cobham, Kent, who in his will bequeathed ¬£5,000See will of Sir Joseph Williamson to set up the school. The school was termed a mathematical school because it specialised in teaching navigation and mathematics to the sons of Freemen of the City of Rochester, the Chatham Naval Dockyard being nearby. ==History== The first building was in 1708 when a \\"school house\\" was built in part of the filled up moat outside the city walls. In 1840 additional rooms were built and in both 1882 and 1893 additions were made. In the late 1960s the buildings were demolished and the site is now a car park next to a nightclub. It is said that the local authority did not know part of the old city wall with a small tower ran through the school buildings, and as a result no further development of the site was allowed. The school's playing fields and swimming pool were originally by the River Medway off Rochester Esplanade; they are now off Maidstone Road, Rochester, next to the area known as Priestfields (not to be confused with Gillingham FC's stadium, Priestfield). An annexe (now known as P block) was built at the Maidstone Road site in the 1950s, housing the second and third years only. In autumn 1968, the whole school moved to a new building the site. Initially this featured a main block, hall, sports hall, gymnasium, 25-metre indoor swimming pool and science block. The school's music block was expanded in 2005 to include a new teaching room and several new practice rooms. In the 1990s a sixth-form centre was constructed and at the turn of the century a maths block was created upon the old staff car park. The sixth-form centre houses a series of classrooms for the use of pupils throughout the school. There are still two sets of temporary classrooms. The school also has extensive sports facilities, including an artificial turf pitch for hockey, two cricket pitches, tennis courts, football and rugby pitches as well as the swimming pool, gym, and sports hall. A new mathematics centre was opened in 2002, in line with the Math's new status as a specialist school for maths and computing. The incorporation of a computing discipline contrasted markedly with the school's attitude towards computing as an educational discipline in the late 1980s, where it was stated that \\"there's no future in software\\". In 2006 the school scrapped its A-level computing course, this despite having received specialist funding to teach the subject. After a six-year gap A-level computing was reinstated as an 11-pupil pilot subject in 2011. After positive results achieved by the pilot group, the option to take computing at A-level and GCSE was reintroduced for 2013. The school was granted an \\"outstanding\\" status in its Ofsted report in 2006 and then again in 2008, and was given specialist status for humanities, focused on history and geography. The school is a National Support School and Dr Holden, the executive principal, a National Leader of Education. The school was also one of the first 100 schools in the country to have been designated a National Teaching School. The school became an academy in April 2011. Former pupils are known as Old Williamsonians and there is an Old Williamsonian Club. Founder's Day is held on the first Saturday of July: pupils attend Rochester Cathedral for a morning service and in the afternoon return to the school for sports and other activities. The following Monday is a school holiday. An art and design technology block ‚Äì called the Da Vinci Block after a competition to decide its name ‚Äì opened in 2012. Food Technology became a part of the curriculum but has since been removed. The English department has since been rehoused in the old art and technology classrooms opposite the hall. In January 2019 the Williamson Trust was merged with Leigh Academies Trust and all Williamson Trust academies, including Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School, joined Leigh Academies Trust. ==House system== Originally there were five houses; Bridge, Castle, Gordon, Pitt and Tower. Bridge House was named after Rochester Bridge (to which all boys who crossed Rochester Bridge on the way to school would belong, and whose colours were to be black and white). Castle House was named after Rochester Castle (whose members were Rochester boys, and whose colours were to be black and red). Gordon House was named after Major General Charles Gordon (to which the boys from Old Brompton and Gillingham would belong, and whose colours were to be blue and white). Pitt House was named after William Pitt the 1st Earl of Chatham (for boys from Chatham and Luton, and whose colours were to be red and white). Lastly, Tower House was named after the Tower of Jezreels (for boys from Gillingham High Street and Chatham Hill, and whose colours were to be green and white). Boys were told to group themselves so as to get some idea of the numbers in each house and to appoint officers. At the start of the Second World War the School had disbanded the House System. In Autumn 1945 new interest had been added that year to all forms of athletic sports by the revival of the House System. There were now four Houses instead of five Houses; Bridge, Castle, Gordon and Pitt. Tower House no longer existed. The Old Tower House included almost entirely boys from Gillingham and Rainham, and very few boys from those districts attended the School. The Houses no longer contained boys from definite areas; the arrangement for drafting boys to the various Houses ensured that any group of four new boys one should be allotted to each House, although the rule was modified in the case of brothers and of sons of former members of the School Houses. As there were likely to be few such sons, and as four Houses was easier to deal with than five, it was thought not desirable to revive Tower House.The Williamsonian Autumn 1945 When the House System was created the original Houses had different colours from today. Bridge changed from black and white to green. Castle changed from black and red to red. Gordon changed from blue and white to dark blue. And finally Pitt changed from red and white to Yellow. When this change happened is not confirmed. More recently, River House was created in 1993 (named after the River Medway, and whose colours were to be purple) and Thetford House in 1996 (named after the sister school in Norfolk, and whose colours were to be light blue). Tower House was reintroduced in 2019. ==Founder's Day== Founder's Day takes place on the first Saturday of July, to honour the founder and other school benefactors. ==Notable former pupils== * Harry Arnold (died 2014), war correspondent and royal reporter on a number of national newspapers, including the Daily Mirror and The Sun * Bob Bean (1935‚Äì87), Labour MP for Rochester and Chatham from 1974‚Äì79 * Wilfrid Butt, biochemist and endocrinologist * Pip Carter, actor, trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, appeared in Robin Hood and Spectre * Bill Esterson, Labour MP for Sefton Central * Guy Fletcher (songwriter) English songwriter who, in partnership with Doug Flett, wrote several hits for other artists, including Elvis.

The Chand Kings were a Hindu ruling clan of Kumaon, which ruled the region after the decline of Katyuri Kings in 11th century AD. ==History== ===Inception=== The Chand kingdom was established by Som Chand in the 10th century, by displacing the Katyuri Kings, who had been ruling the area from the 7th century AD. He continued to call his state Kurmanchal, and established its capital in Champawat in Kali Kumaon, called so, due to its vicinity to river Kali.

In 1581, the Chand King, Rudra Chand (1565‚Äì1597), son of Raja Kalyan Chand seized Sira defeating Raika king Hari Malla and attacked the Garhwal Kingdom for the first time, though this attack was repulsed by then king, Dularam Sah,Garhwal history www.garhwalhimalayas.com. and so were his subsequent attacks. Rudra Chandra was a contemporary of Akbar, and even paid him a visit in Lahore in 1587, as a mark of his obeisance. Akbarnama mentions him as \\"one of the great landlords of India\\", and further talks about his initial hesitation in approaching the court of Akbar, it was only Raja Todar Mal himself, sent his son Kalyan Das to assure him, did his proceed to meet Akbar. Subsequently, the two met and agreed on a concord,Rudra Akbarnama of Abu Fazl, Volume 3, chpt. 196.p807, \\"On 9 ƒÄ·∫ìar he received the felcity...\\"1588 and thus Ain-e-Akbari, written during period of Akbar, also mentions the Sarkar of Kumaon, containing 21 Mahals (a geographical unit of the times) and the revenue collected.Sark√°r of Kum√°on Ain-e-Akbari Vol II, pp. 289. After death of Rudra Chand in 1597, his son, Lakshmi Chand, also continued attacks of Garhwal for many years, though he too was repulsed. He also constructed the ‚ÄòBagnath temple‚Äô at Bageshwar in 1602. ===Peak=== One of most powerful rulers of the Chand dynasty was Baz Bahadur (1638‚Äì78), who met Shahjahan in Delhi, and in 1655 joined forces with him to attack Garhwal, which was under its king, Pirthi Sah, and subsequently captured the Terai region including Dehradun, which was hence separated from the Garhwal kingdom. Baz Bahadur extended his territory east to Karnali river. In 1672, Baz Bahadur started a poll tax, and its revenue was sent to Delhi as a tribute. Baz Bahadur also built the Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal,History of Nainital District The Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909, v. 18, p. 324-325. after Lord Golu, a general in his army, who died valiantly at war.Chitai Temple He also built the Bhimeshwara Mahadev Temple at Bhimtal.Bhimtal British Library. Towards the end of 17th century, Chand Rajas again attacked the Garhwal kingdom, and in 1688 Udyot Chand erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwer and Parbateshwer, to mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti. The Pabateshwar temple was renamed twice, to become the present Nanda Devi temple.Almora Temples www.uttaranchal.org. Later, Jagat Chand (1708‚Äì20), defeated the Raja of Garhwal and pushed him away from Srinagar, and his kingdom was given to a Brahmin.History of Garhwal District The Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909, v. 12, p. 165-166. However, a subsequent king of Garhwal, Pradip Shah (1717‚Äì72), regained control over Garhwal and retained Doon till 1757, when Rohilla leader Najib-ul-Daula established himself there, though he was ousted soon by Pradip Shah.

In the coming years, Jagat Chand‚Äôs successor, Debi Chand (1720-6) took part in the wars of Rohillas of Rohilkhand, and was defeated by the British troops. ===Decline=== In 1744, Ali Mohammed Khan, the Rohilla leader, sent a force into the Chand territory and penetrated through Bhimtal in the Nainital district to Almora; the resistance of Chand army, under its ruler, Kalyan Chand, was weak and ineffective, and Almora fell to the Rohillas, who stayed here for seven short months, though they were ultimately driven out, an exit made possible by paying them a sum of three lakh rupees, and hastened by the harsh terrain of the region. This peace didn‚Äôt last long as after just three months, unhappy over his lieutenants, Ali Mohammed Khan attacked again, though this time, he was stopped right at the entrance to the hills, at Barakheri, and defeated; and he made no further attempts to conquer the Kumaon kingdom, nor did the Muslim rulers of Delhi, and this remained the first and the last attack by Muslim rulers on the region. Reconciliation subsequently came into effected; troops from the hills, under Dip Chand, fought side by side with the Rohillas at Third Battle of Panipat in 1761. In 1760, he renamed the old Parbateshwer temple as Dipchandeshwar temple During British rule, then divisional commissioner of Kumaon, George William Trail, got the statue of the Nanda Devi, which had been relocated to the Udyot Chandeshwar temple, from the 'Malla Mahal' (Upper Court) of Chand kings, where the present collectorate exists, and in time, the temple started being called the ‚ÄòNanda Devi temple‚Äô. The 'Talla Mahal' (Lower Court) of Chand rulers now houses the District Hospital.. Devi Temple Nanda Devi Temple website of Almora city. Due to internal strife, in the coming thirty years the kings lost most of the land they had previously ruled in the plains, and retained only the Bhabhar region. In early 1790, the Gurkhas invaded the Kumaon hills and Almora, under the leadership of Prithvi Narayan Shah; they advanced by crossing River Kali, through Gangoli; and the Chands, under the titular Chand Raja, were driven to the Bhabhar and finally expelled. The Terai and Kashipur were ceded to the British by the Nawab of Awadh in 1801, along with the rest of Rohilkhand. Nepalese rule lasted forCruel Gurkha Regime www.uttaranchal.org. twenty-four years. The end came because of their repeated intrusion into British territories in the Terai from 1800 onwards. Lord Moira, the Governor-General of India, decided to attack Almora in December 1814, marking the beginning of the Anglo-Nepalese War. After the war, the old Lal Mandi fort, near Almora (present cantonment), was renamed ‚ÄòFort Moira‚Äô.Almora British Library.

A truce was called the same day, and with the ratification of Treaty of Sugauli on 4 March 1816, Kumaon and Garhwal became a part of the British Raj. ==List of Chand Kings== Badri Datt Pandey, in his book Kumaun Ka Itihaas lists the Chand kings as following:Pandey(1993) pg197-332 {class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"text- align:center;font-size: 11pt\\" - !width=\\"150\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" King !rowspan=\\"1\\"Reign !rowspan=\\"1\\"Notes -  Som Chand  700-721  -  Atm Chand  721-740  -  Purn Chand  740-758  -  Indra Chand  758-778  Opened Silk Factories -  Sansar Chand  778-813  -  Sudha Chand  813-833  -  Hamir Chand  833-856  -  Vina Chand  856-869  Lost to Khas Kings -  Vir Chand  1065-1080  -  Rup Chand  1080-1093  -  Laxmi Chand  1093-1113  -  Dharm Chand  1113-1121  -  Karm Chand  1121-1140  -  Ballal Chand  1140-1149  -  Nami Chand  1149-1170  -  Nar Chand  1170-1177  -  Nanaki Chand  1177-1195  -  Ram Chand  1195-1205  -  Bhishm Chand  1205-1226  -  Megh Chand  1226-1233  -  Dhyan Chand  1233-1251  -  Parvat Chand  1251-1261  -  Thor Chand  1261-1275  -  Kalyan Chand II  1275-1296  -  Trilok Chand  1296-1303  Conquered Chhakhata Built a fort at Bhimtal -  Damaru Chand  1303-1321  -  Dharm Chand  1321-1344  -  Abhay Chand  1344-1374  -  Garur Gyan Chand  1374-1419  Established authority over Bhabar and Terai; later lost them to nawab of Sambhal -  Harihar Chand  1419-1420  -  Udyan Chand  1420-1421  built Baleshwar Temple at Champawat Captured Chaugarkha -  Atma Chand II  1421-1422  -  Hari Chand II  1422-1423  -  Vikram Chand  1423-1437  Completed Baleshwar Temple -  Bharati Chand  1437-1450  Defeated Doti -  Ratna Chand  1450-1488  Defeated Bams of Sor Defeated Doti again -  Kirti Chand  1488-1503  annexed Barahmandal, Pali and Faldakot -  Pratap Chand  1503-1517  -  Tara Chand  1517-1533  -  Manik Chand  1533-1542  -  Kalyan Chand III  1542-1551  -  Purna Chand  1551-1555  -  Bhishm Chand  1555-1560  laid foundation stone of Alamnagar lost Barahmandal to Khas Sardar Gajuwathinga -  Balo Kalyan Chand  1560-1568  recaptured Barahmandal moved capital to Alamnagar and renamed it Almora Annexed Mankot and Danpur -  Rudra Chand  1568-1597  Successfully defended Terai from nawab of Kath and Gola founded the city of Rudrapur Annexed Sira -  Laxmi Chand  1597-1621  built Laxmeswar and Bagnath Temple at Almora and Bageshwar respectively Invaded Garhwal 7 times without any Success -  Dilip Chand  1621-1624  -  Vijay Chand  1624-1625  -  Trimal Chand  1625-1638  -  Baz Bahadur Chand  1638-1678  Captured Dehradun -  Udyot Chand  1678-1698  Defeated Garhwal and Doti -  Gyan Chand  1698-1708  Defeated Garhwal and expelled fateh shah from Srinagar -  Jagat Chand  1708-1720  Defeated Garhwal -  Devi Chand  1720-1726  -  Ajit Chand  1726-1729  -  Kalyan Chand V  1729-1747  Defeated Rohillas -  Deep Chand  1747-1777  -  Mohan Chand  1777-1779  Defeated by King Lalit Shah of Garhwal -  Pradyumn Chand  1779-1786  Son of king Lalit Shah of Garhwal -  Mohan Chand  1786-1788  Overthrew Pradyumn Shah; Became king for second time -  Shiv Chand  1788  -  Mahendra Chand  1788-1790  Defeated by Gorkhas } ==Legacy== The first capital of Chand rulers, Champawat, in the stronghold popularly known as Kali Kumaon, is now a district headquarters town, and hold many remnants of once powerful Chand reign, including a medieval fort, Baleshwar temple, Nagnath Temple, etc. Other temples of their reign are Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal, and Bhimeshwara Mahadev Temple at Bhimtal. ==See also== *Kumauni people ==References== ==Further reading== * History of Kumaun : English version of \\"Kumaun ka itihas\\". by B.

SHORAN is an acronym for SHOrt RAnge Navigation, a type of electronic navigation and bombing system using a precision radar beacon. It was developed during World War II and the first stations were being set up in Europe when the war ended. It saw its first combat use in the B-25, B-26 and B-29 bomber aircraft during the Korean War. SHORAN used ground-based transponders to respond to interrogation signals sent from the bomber aircraft. By measuring the round-trip time to and from one of the transponders, the distance to that ground station could be accurately determined. The aircraft flew an arcing path that kept it at a predetermined distance from one of the stations. The distance to a second station was also being measured, and when it reached a predetermined distance from that station as well, the bombs were dropped. The basic idea was similar to the Oboe system developed by the Royal Air Force, but in Oboe the transponder was on the aircraft. This limited Oboe to guiding a single aircraft per ground station, while SHORAN could guide dozens, limited only by how rapidity the ground station's transponders could respond. SHORAN was sent into combat due to the presence of the MiG-15 over Korea, which drove the B-29's from daylight combat in June 1951. Night operations were not very productive and the US Air Force became interested in any way to improve their results. The system was in place and the crews trained by November 1952, and SHORAN remained in use from then until the end of the war. It was particularly effective during early 1953 when the North Korean Air Force began to re-equip in case a new offense opened. B-29's began the campaign, but only a dozen aircraft were available, so they were soon supplanted by B-26s to maintain constant bombing of the airfields. The possible offensive never occurred; the armistice was signed in July. It was not used after that point, due to Strategic Air Command's increasing focus on long-range bombing with nuclear weapons. Although SHORAN was used by the military only briefly, surplus equipment soon found a new use in the oil and gas industry, where it was used to position ships with high accuracy for seismic measurements. ==Origin== In 1938 RCA engineer Stuart William Seeley, while attempting to remove \\"ghost\\" signals from an experimental television system, realized that he could measure distances by time differences in radio reception. In summer 1940, Seeley proposed building SHORAN for the Army Air Force. Contract was awarded 9 months later, and SHORAN given its first military flight tests in August 1942. First procurement was spring 1944, with initial combat operations in northern Italy on December 11, 1944. During the system's development, Seeley and an RCA manager flew to England to describe the system to American and British air force personnel. There they observed the Oboe, which could guide only a single aircraft, unlike Shoran which could guide multiple. On the return flight, nearly all information on Shoran was lost in a plane crash, and Seeley was forced to recreate the records from his own memory. He received a Magellanic award for his work in 1960.The Magellanic Premium of the American Philosophical Society ==Structure== SHORAN, which operates at 300 MHz, requires an airborne AN/APN-3 set and two AN/CPN-2 or 2A ground stations. The equipment on board the aircraft includes a transmitter, a receiver, an operator's console and a K-1A model bombing computer. The transmitter sends pulses to one of the ground stations and the system calculates the range in statute miles by clocking the elapsed time between transmitter pulse and the returned signal. The system was intended for use in navigation, but it became obvious that it would work well for blind targeting during bombing runs in poor visibility. The setup made up of the K-1A bombing computer combined with the navigation system was the first SHORAN. The SHORAN system is designed so that as the aircraft faces the target, the low-frequency station should be on the left, and the high-frequency station is on the right. This allows the computer to triangulate the two stations and the target. ==Limitations== The limitations of SHORAN included: * A maximum range of and a clear radio path * No more than 20 aircraft may contact a pair of stations at once * Complex parameter calculations made prior to flight cannot be changed during the bomb run * Station angle must be between 30 degrees and 150 degrees, and the exact geographical position of each of the two ground stations and the target must be known * The ambiguity must be recognized and taken into account * There are only four possible approaches to any one target, all predefined by the geometry of the system * Because the system is line-of-sight limited, the plane must fly at altitudes above and sometimes as high as , depending on local geography. These altitudes are not easily made by a fully loaded bomber. The engines are worked to capacity. * Only stationary targets can be attacked * The use of statute miles instead of nautical miles may be confusing in some situations ==High tech bombing in Korea== Little new top-of-the-line technology was used in Korea, but SHORAN was an exception. B-26 planes were first equipped with the system in January, 1951, and first carried it into battle the following month. Some problems immediately recognized were that ground stations tended to be too far from the targets, the ground and aircraft equipment was not maintained properly, few technicians knew how to work the equipment, and operators were too unfamiliar with Korean geography to use the system to the fullest extent. Changes were made and by June 1951 ground stations were located in more useful areas, such as islands and mountaintops, and training of operators and technicians familiarized them with the system. By November 1952 these changes had developed SHORAN into a reliable accurate blind-bombing system which was used by B-29 and B-26 aircraft for the remainder of the war. ==Use in petroleum exploration== Beginning in the late 1940s and continuing into the 1980s surplus SHORAN systems had become widely used to provide precision navigation in oil and gas exploration industry. Companies like pioneer Offshore Navigation, Inc., Navigation Management, Coastal Surveys (based in Singapore) and Western Geophysical deployed SHORAN receivers to navigate seismic survey vessels and position drilling rigs around the world. The technology was key to the successful development of the offshore oil & gas industry in the postwar era. Truck-portable SHORAN transponders and up to antennas were set up within a few feet of geodesic survey markers near the coast. SHORAN chains consisting of three or four shore stations were used to provide highly accurate navigation across large exploration tracts and as much as offshore. Frequently, the massive vacuum tube transmitters were fitted with solid-state control boxes for more reliable operation and to improve reception of weaker signals over the horizon. ==See also== *Alpha (radio navigation) *Battle of the Beams *CHAYKA *GEE (navigation) *G-H (navigation) *Global positioning system *LORAN *Oboe (navigation) *OMEGA Navigation System *SCR-277 ==References== * \\"Shoran - A Precision Five Hundred Mile Yardstick\\", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 105, no. 4 (Aug. 15, 1961), pages 447-451. * SHORAN history, Chapter Six - Research for Victory, Pioneering in Electronics, by Kenyon Kilbon Category:Aircraft radars Category:Military electronics of the United States Category:Equipment of the United States Air Force Category:World War II American electronics Category:World War II radars ","title":"SHORAN"},{"id":"3256311","text":"The 3 arrondissements of the Lot department are: # Arrondissement of Cahors, (prefecture of the Lot department: Cahors) with 98 communes.

It connects the gold mining districts to each other and to the Arkansas Valley. == History== The Gold Belt Byway is made up mostly of roads that connected mining towns to the Arkansas Valley. On the byway you will see many abandoned mines, buildings, and towns that prospered during the Colorado Gold Rush. Along the byway you will see numerous buildings that have been unchanged since the mines went bust. Although gold is no longer the main mining export of this region many mines still exist. == Route description == The Gold Belt Byway contains many roads. Most of them are dirt roads that are narrow and run through canyons and other geological features. === Phantom Canyon Road === Phantom Canyon Road is a scenic road that connects Ca√±on City and Victor. The road goes through Phantom Canyon. The road has two tunnels and three elevated bridges. It has many camp locations. It was originally the route of a railroad that connected Florence and Cripple Creek. The route contains many narrow roads and high wooden bridges. The road is unpaved. === Shelf Road === A Climber In the Shelf Road Portion of the byway.Shelf Road is a portion of the byway going through Fourmile Canyon. It was originally used as a stagecoach road. The cliffs of the canyon near Shelf Road offer some of the best sport climbing in Colorado. === High Park Road === High Park Road was the first route to connect gold mines with the Arkansas Valley. Unlike Shelf Road and Phantom Canyon Road, it doesn't run through a canyon and is entirely paved. High Park Road is located in area where cattle ranching takes place. === Teller County Road 1 === Teller County Road 1, shortened to Teller 1, was the first stagecoach route to Cripple Creek and thus it is called County Road 1. It is a paved road that offers diverse views of scenery. For example, along the road are steep mountains and rolling hills where cattle graze. === Gold Camp Road=== Gold Camp Road follows the former railroad from Colorado Springs to Cripple Creek called the \\"Short Line\\". In the 1920s the railroad was converted to a car toll road, eventually becoming a free public road. In 1988, tunnel #3 collapsed and was never repaired. This portion of the road is now closed to vehicular traffic and is popular with bikers and hikers, and vehicular traffic was rerouted to Old Stage Road behind The Broadmoor. In September 2013, flooding washed out a large portion of the road between tunnels one and two. It is said that the tunnels are haunted and many stories abound concerning the tunnels. == Major landmarks == Pikes Peak Window Rock Major landmarks along the route include the following: *Pikes Peak *Royal Gorge *Phantom Canyon ==See also== * * ==References== == External links == *Gold Belt Byway *A journey through phantom canyon *Travel Along the Gold Belt Byway Category:Transportation in Fremont County, Colorado Category:Colorado Scenic Byways Category:National Scenic Byways in Colorado Category:Pikes Peak Category:Transportation in Teller County, Colorado Category:Climbing areas of Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Fremont County, Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Teller County, Colorado Category:Bureau of Land Management Back Country Byways ","title":"Gold Belt Byway"},{"id":"3256337","text":"The 4 arrondissements of the Maine-et-Loire department are: # Arrondissement of Angers, (prefecture of the Maine-et-Loire department: Angers) with 66 communes.

(James Blast Orchester) is a comedy heavy metal band from Erlangen, Germany. J.B.O. was founded in 1989 by Vito C. and Hannes \\"G.Laber\\" Holzmann, and is known for parodies of rock and pop songs. The band has written more of its own songs since 2000, but continues to produce parodies, which they refer to as Bl√∂edsinn ‚Äì an intentional misspelling of \\"Bl√∂dsinn,\\" which means \\"nonsense\\" or \\"stupidity\\" in German. The original name was \\"James Blast Orchester\\" but they shortened this to J.B.O. in June 1996 after James Last threatened legal action. The Patrizier brewery of Nuremberg earlier threatened to sue J.B.O. for slander. The band have since changed references to \\"Patrizier Br√§u\\" in their lyrics to \\"Pariser Bier\\" (Parisian beer). 'Schmitti' and Holmer \\"a Bier\\" Graap, two of the founder members, left the band in 2000. They were replaced in 2001 by Ralph Bach and Wolfram Kellner. Kellner previously played in Fiddler's Green, which is alluded to in the song \\"Arschloch und Spa√ü dabei\\" ('Asshole and enjoying it'): \\"man sagt sogar, dass Wolfram fr√ºher Folk-Musik g'macht h√§tt\\" (\\"They even say that Wolfram used to play folk music\\"). The Kitzmann brewery of Erlangen supports the band with gimmick products, and has been featured in the band's lyrics. The band celebrated its fifteenth birthday on July 31, 2004 with the slogan \\"30 Halbe!\\" (\\"30 halves\\" = 30 half-litre glasses of beer) The band still tours, especially in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. \\"G.

Vesterheim‚Äôs exhibitions explore the diversity of American immigration through the lens of the Norwegian-American experience and highlight the best in historic and contemporary Norwegian folk and fine arts. ==History== Vesterheim Museum was founded in 1877 as the Norwegian-American Historic Museum. It began as a part of nearby Luther College. In 1967, the Norwegian-American Museum incorporated, becoming a separate entity from Luther College. In 1977 it added Vesterheim to its name.Museum and Library Chronicles Lives of Norwegian Immigrants (Vesterheim Museum and Library) The museum moved into a larger location, a grand Italianate building in downtown Decorah vacated by a publishing company. The name Vesterheim appropriately translates to \\"western home\\" in Norwegian. The museum now offers educational events, publications, and lectures related to its mission. Vesterheim's Folk Art School offers classes in painting, woodworking, knifemaking, fiber arts, Nordic cooking, and more in the Norwegian tradition. Each year it presents \\"The National Norwegian-American Folk Art Exhibition\\" in these traditional Norwegian folk arts: knitting, rosemaling, weaving, woodcarving, knifemaking, and metalworking. ==Heritage Park== Heritage Park is a collection of historic buildings located behind the museum's main building. ===Painter-Bernatz Mill=== Painter-Bernatz Mill The Painter-Bernatz Mill is at 200 North Mill Street, in Heritage Park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The Old Stone Mill was built by William Painter, one of Winneshiek County's earliest European settlers, in 1851 and is commonly believed to be the oldest building in Decorah.The Old Stone Mill in Decorah, Iowa (Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum) ===Norris Miller House=== Norris Miller House The Norris Miller House is at 118 North Mill Street, in Heritage Park. Norris Miller, a carpenter from Ohio, built this house in west Decorah in 1856. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. ===Haugan House=== Norwegian immigrants Hans and Anna Haugan built the house on a farm southeast of Decorah during the 1860s and lived in it at least until 1880. The house is a representative example of the husmann dwelling (Norwegian: hytte) used in Norway during the 19th Century. Husmann is the name for the Norwegian tenant farmer with leasehold estate somewhat similar to the Swedish torp or the Scottish crofter.Haugen, Einar (1965) Norwegian English Dictionary (University of Wisconsin Press. Madison, Wisconsin). The husmann formed a key element of the Norwegian farm culture. The house used by typical husmann was often a simple log cabin or cottage made of rough hewed lumber.Hassing, Arne Norway‚Äôs Organized Response to Emigration (The Norwegian- American Historical Association. Volume 25: page 54). ===Valdres House=== This represents a typical Norwegian landowner‚Äôs home. The Valdres House was built about 1795 on the Moahaugen farm in Heggenes, √òystre Slidre in Oppland, Norway. The house was enlarged and a covered entry added in the 1860s. Vesterheim acquired the house through the efforts of the rosemaler Sigmund Aarseth and of Kolbein Dahle, director of the Valdres Folk Museum in Fagernes, in the valley of Valdres, Norway. The house was taken down and shipped to Vesterheim in 1975-76. The house was reassembled by Norwegian carpenters commissioned by the Valdres Folk Museum. ===Egge-Koren House=== Erik Egge built this house in 1852 on his farm five miles southeast of Decorah. In July 1853, he married Helen Pedersdatter, a widow with two small children. From December 1853 to March 1854, the newlyweds, Rev. U. Vilhelm Koren and his wife Elisabeth, lived with the Egges. Ulrik Vilhelm Koren was a pioneer Lutheran minister, who played a significant role in the development of the spiritual and intellectual development of Norwegians in America. Koren played an active part in the Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, holding various including president of the synod from 1894 until his death in 1910. Elisabeth Koren was an author of The Diary of Elisabeth Koren, 1853-1855 which provides detailed insight into what it was like for four adults and two children to spend the winter in a one-room 14-by-16-foot log house.The Diary of Elisabeth Koren, 1853-1855 (Koren, Elizabeth.

Morton of Kentucky and in 1971 worked in the office of Governor Louie B. Nunn. She then launched a career in public relations, eventually running her own firm in Hart County, Kentucky. She resides in Bonnieville in Hart County. Martin legally changed her name to \\"Peppy\\" from her given name of Josephine Ellen when she unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Kentucky General Assembly in the 1970s. ==Campaigns== In 1999, Martin ran for governor against Paul E. Patton, the Democratic incumbent who through a change in the Kentucky Constitution was the state's first governor eligible to seek a second consecutive term. Martin's running mate was Wanda Cornelius, a school board member from Taylor County. In the Republican primary, Martin defeated perennial candidate David Lynn Williams, not to be confused with State Senator David L. Williams of Burkesville. The Martin-Cornelius ticket lost to incumbent Governor Patton and Lieutenant Governor Steve Henry in a landslide in the general election. Martin announced her intent to run for President as a Reform Party candidate in 1996 and, later, as a Reform candidate for the United States Congress in 2000, though she never qualified to appear on the ballot in either race. In 2003, Martin unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the office of Kentucky Auditor of Public Accounts, ultimately losing in the primary.

Also referred to as Akshardham Temple or Delhi Akshardham, the complex displays millennia of traditional and modern Hindu culture, spirituality, and architecture. Inspired by Yogiji Maharaj and created by Pramukh Swami Maharaj, it was constructed by BAPS. The temple was officially opened on 6 November 2005 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in the presence of Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Manmohan Singh, L.K Advani and B.L Joshi. The temple, at the centre of the complex, was built according to the Vastu shastra and Pancharatra shastra. In Swaminarayan Akshardham New Delhi, similar to its predecessor Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, the main shrine is the focal point and maintains the central position of the entire complex. There are various exhibition halls which provide information about the life and work of Swaminarayan. The designers of the complex have adopted contemporary modes of communication and technology to create the various exhibition halls. The complex features an abhishek mandap, Sahaj Anand water show, a thematic garden and three exhibitions namely Sahajanand Darshan (Hall of Values), Neelkanth Darshan (an IMAX film on the early life of Swaminarayan as the teenage yogi, Neelkanth), and Sanskruti Darshan (cultural boat ride).

It rises high, spans wide, and extends long. It is intricately carved with flora, fauna, dancers, musicians, and deities. A collaborative effort by Vikram Lall,International Conference on India and Central Asia, 2018 BAPS, and Sompuras (traditional temple architects), the Akshardham Mandir was designed in accordance with the standards of Maharishi Vastu Architecture and features a blend of architectural styles across India. It is entirely constructed from Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble. Based on traditional Hindu architectural guidelines (Shilpa shastras) on maximum temple life span, it makes no use of ferrous metal. Thus, it has no support from steel or concrete. The mandir also consists of 234 ornately carved pillars, nine domes, and 20,000 murtis of swamis, devotees, and acharyas. The mandir also features the Gajendra Pith at its base, a plinth paying tribute to the elephant for its importance in Hindu culture and India's history. It contains 148 life sized elephants in total weighing a total of 3000 tons. Under the temple's central dome lies the 11-foot (3.4m) high murti of Swaminarayan seated in abhayamudra to whom the temple is dedicated. Swaminarayan is surrounded by images of the faith's lineage of Gurus depicted either in a devotional posture or in a posture of service. Each murti is made of paanch dhaatu or five metals in accordance to Hindu tradition. The temple also houses the murtis of Sita Ram, Radha Krishna, Shiv Parvati, and Lakshmi Narayan.

Studies on education, medicare, tribal and rural welfare, ecology, and culture are conducted within the centre. ==Planning and development== The Akshardham complex in Delhi ===Planning=== The building had been planned since 1968 as a vision of Yogiji Maharaj. Yogiji Maharaj, the spiritual head of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha at the time, expressed his desire for wanting a grand temple built on the banks of the Yamuna river to two or three devotee families of Swaminarayan that resided in New Delhi at the time. Attempts were made to start the project, however little progress was made. In 1971, Yogiji Maharaj died. In 1982, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj's successor as the spiritual head of BAPS, started to continue fulfilling the dream of his guru Yogiji Maharaj and prompted devotees to look into the possibility of building the temple in Delhi. A request for the plan was put forward to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and several different places were suggested, including Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. Pramukh Swami Maharaj stood firm in following the wishes of Yogiji Maharaj to build a temple on the Yamuna. In April 2000, after 18 years, the Delhi Development Authority offered of land, and the Uttar Pradesh Government offered for the project. Upon receiving the land, Pramukh Swami Maharaj performed puja on the site for success in the project. Construction on the temple began on 8 November 2000 and Akshardham was officially opened on 6 November 2005, with the building being completed in two days short of five years. ===Environmental clearance=== An amendment to the Government of India's Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 1994 was made in 2004, which required that environmental clearance be granted to any parcel of land that falls under the Yamuna floodplain before beginning any construction activities. Since Akshardham commenced construction activities in 2000, prior to the enactment of this amendment, it did not apply to Akshardham. However certain NGOs and activists felt that the temple was constructed without obtaining the necessary environmental clearances. On January 2005, the U.P. Employees Federation presented their case before the Supreme Court of India that the temple had not obtained necessary environmental clearances and that it would be harmful to the environment. After hearing the case, the Supreme Court observed that in the construction of Akshardham, all the Land Use Plans had been adhered to and clearance of expert bodies like the Central Water Commission and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute has been obtained. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the Akshardham construction was lawful and did not violate environmental norms. Despite this ruling, some activists and politicians continued to assert that the Akshardham construction was illegal and posed a threat to the Yamuna River floodplains. In a 2009 ruling on a related issue, the Supreme Court further clarified that it rejected as false the assertions that Akshardham did not have environmental permissions and was harmful to the Yamuna riverbed. It reiterated its earlier 2005 Ruling that Akshardham had received all necessary environmental permissions from Central Water Commission and NEERI, which is an autonomous body, and that the Akshardham site was not located on the Yamuna ‚Äúriverbed‚Äù or ‚Äúfloodplain‚Äù, but 1700 meters away from the Yamuna River bank. === Development === A team of eight swamis were assigned to oversee the Akshardham project. The majority of the team had gained experience from work on the Akshardham in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, Delhi Akshardham's sister complex. During development, Pramukh Swami Maharaj was consulted in many aspects of the monument's construction. Construction on the Akshardham complex Around 1997 and 1998, the idea to start development on the temple, by beginning the stone carving, had been requested. However, Pramukh Swami Maharaj asserted that the construction should only start after the land was acquired. The initial work done on the site was on the foundation. Initially, the site wasn't considered ideal for construction. As a result, a deep foundation was imperative. To construct a stable foundation, of rocks and sand were entwined with wire mesh and topped by five feet of concrete. Five million fired bricks raised the foundation another . These bricks were then topped by three more feet of concrete to form the main support under the monument. On 2 July 2001, the first sculpted stone was laid. The team of eight swamis consisted of scholars in the field of the Pancharatra Shastra, a Hindu scripture on architecture and deity carving. The swamis watched over stonework as well as the research on carvings on Indian craftsmanship from between the eighth and twelfth centuries. This research was done at various sites such as Angkor Wat, as well as Jodhpur, Jagannath Puri, Konark & temples of Bhubaneswar of Odisha and other temples in South India. Seven thousand carvers and three thousand volunteers were put to work for the construction Akshardham. With over 6,000 tons of pink sandstone coming from Rajasthan, workshop sites were set up around places within the state. Amongst the carvers were local farmers and fifteen hundred tribal women who had suffered from a drought and received economic gain due to this work. The initial stone cutting was done by machine, while the detailed carvings were done by hand. Every night, over one hundred trucks were sent to Akshardham, where four thousand workers and volunteers operated on the construction site. ===Opening ceremony=== Akshardham was consecrated on 6 November 2005 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj and ceremoniously dedicated to the nation by the President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Indian Parliament, Lal Krishna Advani, with the presence of 25,000 guests. After touring the central monument, president Kalam then gave a speech on where Akshardham fits within the society, and finished by saying, Prime Minister Singh followed by hoping that this would usher in religious tolerance and praised the architecture of the complex. He made note of it becoming a future landmark of India while L. K. Advani called it \\"the most unique monument of the world.\\" Pramukh Swami Maharaj ended the night's speeches and expressed the wish that \\"In this Akshardham, may one and all find inspiration to mould their lives and may their lives become divine. Such is my prayer to God.\\" ===Garbhagruh renovation and other events=== On 13 July 2010, a newly designed garbhagruh, or inner sanctum, was inaugurated by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in the main monument within the Akshardham complex. The new garbhagruh includes a decorated, canopied sihasan, upon which the murti of Swaminarayan rests and features intricate carvings and gold-leafed designs. Akshardham served as a featured attraction during the 2010 Commonwealth Games held in Delhi. Through the duration of the Games, hundreds of athletes, teams, and enthusiasts from around the world visited the complex. On 14 November 2010, the Swaminarayan Research Institute at Akshardham was inaugurated through an event organised by the women's faction of the organisation, highlighting the value of seva, or socially beneficial volunteer efforts, in society through mandirs, churches, mosques, and other places of worship. ==Guinness world record== On 17 December 2007, Michael Whitty, an official world record adjudicator for Guinness World Record, travelled to Ahmedabad, India to present a new world record to Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the spiritual leader of BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, for the Akshardham complex. The record was presented for Akshardham as the World's Largest Comprehensive Hindu Temple (certificate). The certificate states, Upon presentation of the award, Michael Whitty stated, \\"It took us three months of research, poring over the extensive architectural plans of the Akshardham and also those of other temples of comparable size, visiting and inspecting the site, before we were convinced that Akshardham deserved the title...\\" There are three temples, the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, and the Annamalaiyar Temple in Thiruvannamalai, all located in Tamil Nadu, India, which claim to be larger than Akshardham. The trustees of these temples have reportedly disputed the Guinness World Record. ==See also== *Swaminarayan Akshardham (Gandhinagar) *Swaminarayan Akshardham (New Jersey) ==References== ==External links== ;Akshardham Information * Official Akshardham Delhi Website * Akshardham Temple Complex on the Incredible India website * Panoramic Virtual Tour of Akshardham ;Other * Guinness World Records ‚Äì Adjudications ‚Äì World's Largest Hindu Temple * BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha- The organisation responsible for the creation of Akshardham * Mystic India- The film shown at Akshardham * Akshardham Gandhinagar Website * Category:Buildings and structures in New Delhi Category:Hindu temples in Delhi Category:Swaminarayan temples Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in India ","title":"Swaminarayan Akshardham (New Delhi)"},{"id":"3256449","text":"Bhaichung Stadium is a football stadium in Namchi, the district headquarters of South Sikkim district in the state of Sikkim, India.

She was the sixth and youngest child born to farmers. American helicopters landed in her village when she was 12 years old. At the age of 14, she endured torture in a South Vietnamese government prison for \\"revolutionary sympathies\\". After being released, she had fallen under suspicion of being a government spy, and was sentenced to death but instead of being executed she was raped by two Viet Cong soldiers.University of Minnesota: Biography of Le Ly Hayslip She fled to Saigon, where she and her mother worked as housekeepers for a wealthy Vietnamese family, but this position ended after Hayslip's affair with her employer and subsequent pregnancy. Hayslip and her mother fled to Da Nang. During this time, Hayslip supported both her mother and an infant son, Hung (whom she would later rename Jimmy), while unmarried and working in the black market, as an occasional drug courier and, once, as a prostitute. She worked for a short period of time as a nurse assistant in a Da Nang hospital and began dating Americans. She had several unsuccessful relationships before meeting and marrying an American civilian contractor named Ed Munro in 1969. Although he was more than twice her age, she had another son with him, Thomas. The following year Hayslip moved to San Diego, California, to join him, and briefly supported her family as a homemaker. In 1973, he died of emphysema, leaving Le Ly a widow at age 24. In 1974 she married Dennis Hayslip. Her second marriage, however, was not a happy one. Dennis was a heavy drinker, clinically depressed and full of rage. Her third and youngest son, Alan, was fathered by Dennis and born on her 26th birthday. The couple filed for divorce in 1982 after Dennis committed domestic violence. Shortly thereafter, he was found dead in a parked van outside a school building. He had established a trust fund, however, that left his wife with some money, and he had insurance that paid off the mortgage of the house. ==Books== Her first book, When Heaven and Earth Changed Places: A Vietnamese Woman's Journey from War to Peace (Doubleday, 1989), tells the story of her somewhat peaceful early childhood and war-torn adolescence. The nonlinear structure alternates between the narration of her life in Vietnam as a child and her first return to Vietnam and her family in 1986. The two stories are interwoven to show the circular nature of Hayslip's journey, both her physical journey and her emotional one. Her second memoir, Child of War, Woman of Peace (Doubleday, 1993), continues the same themes in a more linear narrative. Set in the United States during the final years of the Vietnam War, Hayslip must deal with an alien culture and the idea that she may never be able to return to her family and native country, where she is viewed as a traitor. Her tenacity and business skills help her profit, and eventually, she is able to found the East Meets West Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to improving the health and welfare of the Vietnamese, as well as creating self-sufficiency of the people to run the programs started in Vietnam by East Meets West. This memoir documents not only her struggles and successes in the United States but also her growing need to help heal the pain caused by the Vietnam War in both the United States and in Vietnam. The 1993 film Heaven & Earth, directed by Oliver Stone, is based on her life. She also has a cameo appearance in the film.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/vietnam-war- novel-was-not-written-by-an-american.html Le Ly Hayslip founded two charitable organizations: East Meets West Foundation and Global Village Foundation for humanitarian and emergency assistance to the needy in Vietnam and some other countries in Asia.Global Village FoundationVolunteer Match ==Awards== In 1995, Le Ly Hayslip was honored by the California State Assembly award in Sacramento for her humanitarian and reconciliation activities.Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) ‚Äì Open Forum Psychosocial Response to Disasters ==Bibliography== ===Books=== *When Heaven and Earth Changed Places: A Vietnamese Woman's Journey from War to Peace (Doubleday, 1989) *Child of War, Woman of Peace (Doubleday, 1993) ==Filmography== ===Films=== *Heaven & Earth (1993) ==See also== * East Meets West Foundation * Global Village Foundation ==Further reading== * * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:American memoirists Category:American Buddhists Category:Vietnamese emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Vietnamese descent Category:Vietnamese women writers Category:Vietnamese people of the Vietnam War Category:Writers of Vietnamese descent Category:Children in war Category:American writers of Vietnamese descent Category:Women in the Vietnam War Category:People of the Vietnam War Category:American women memoirists Category:American women non-fiction writers ","title":"Le Ly Hayslip"},{"id":"3256458","text":"The 3 arrondissements of the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques department are: # Arrondissement of Bayonne, (subprefecture: Bayonne) with 122 communes.

It is an airborne threat warning and countermeasures control system built to be successor to the United States Navy's AN/ALR-45. Northrop Grumman Corporation's Electronic Systems sector (Rolling Meadows, Illinois) was the main contractor for the AN/ALR-67(V) and (V)2. Raytheon Electronic Warfare Systems (Goleta, California) was the main contractor for the AN/ALR-67(V)3. == Northrop Grumman AN/ALR-67(V) and AN/ALR-67(V)2 == The AN/ALR-67 countermeasures warning and control system is the standard threat warning system for tactical aircraft and was specifically designed for the A-6E/SWIP, AV-8B, F-14B, F-14D and F/A-18. The system detects, identifies and displays radars and radar-guided weapon systems in the C to J frequency range (about 0.5 to 20 GHz). The system also coordinates its operation with onboard fire-control radars, datalinks, jammers, missile detection systems and anti-radiation missiles. The AN/ALR-67(V)2 comprises the following units: * four small spiral high-band antennas to provide 360¬∞ azimuth RF coverage * four wideband, high-band quadrant receivers * a low-band array plus receiver to provide 360¬∞ azimuth low-band coverage * a narrowband superheterodyne receiver for signal analysis functions * twin CPU * an azimuth display unit (ADU) * control unit. The AN/ALR-67(V)2 in turn has been given a significant enhancement in capability, through Engineering Change Procedure ECP-510 to the AN/ALR-67E(V)2 standard. The AN/ALR-67E(V)2 provides additional enhancements including a 10-fold improvement in detection ranges when in the presence of a wingman's radar signals; it also incorporates inertial guidance system (INS) stabilisation for accurate display in high g manoeuvres and during high roll maneuvers. The designation ALR-67B(V)2 is in connection with the ALR-67 systems fitted to Spain's EF-18 and Canadian's CF-18 aircraft. Over 1,600 AN/ALR-67(V) and AN/ALR-67(V)2 systems have been sold. The AN/ALR-67(V) has been supplied to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps and the air forces of Australia, Canada, Finland, Kuwait, Malaysia, Spain and Switzerland. == Raytheon AN/ALR-67(V)3 == The AN/ALR-67(V)3 is commonly referred to as the Advanced Special Receiver (ASR) set. The receiver electronics unit has been upgraded to a fully channelized digital architecture with dual 32-bit processors, yet with an overall reduction in system size and weight. The Azimuth Display Indicator (ADI) is a 3 in (76.2 mm) diameter CRT or LCD cockpit display, carried over from the AN/ALR-67(V)2, used to show intercepted threats. The AN/ALR-67(V)3 also forms part of the electronic countermeasures programme, including an interface to the ALE-50 towed decoy system. In August 1999, Raytheon was awarded an initial contract for full-rate production of the AN/ALR-67(V)3 for the U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, totalling 34 complete installations, together with 40 spare quadrant receivers and five countermeasures receivers. These were delivered during 2001/02. Further production contracts followed, with the latest in April 2005, where Raytheon received its seventh production contract for 42 systems totalling US$ 44 million. This contract brought total orders to 284 receivers plus spares. It was reported on 13 September 2006 that the Australian Defence minister has accepted a recommendation to stop development of the ALR-2002 for the F/A-18, the RAAF will most likely install the ALR-67V(3) instead. On 3 August 2007, Deagel.com reported that the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a possible foreign military sale to Canada of AN/ALR-67(V)3 radar warning receivers as well as associated equipment and services. The total value, if all options are exercised, could be as high as $209 million. This notice of a potential sale is required by law; it does not mean that the sale has been concluded. ==Other variants== A variant of this system, designated AN/ALR-67(V)4, was included in a proposed upgrade for the F-14A but was never implemented due to the retirement of those aircraft in the United States. == External links == * AN/ALR-67 at FAS * EW Programs * Northrop Grumman product information on the ALR-67(V)2 * Raytheon product information on the ALR-67(V)3 == References == Category:Radar warning receivers Category:Electronic warfare equipment Category:Military electronics of the United States Category:Raytheon Company products Category:Radiofrequency receivers Category:Equipment of the United States Air Force ","title":"AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver"},{"id":"3256519","text":"Second breakfast (or , , , , ) is a meal eaten after breakfast, but before lunch. It is a traditional meal in Bavaria, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Hungary. In Bavaria and Poland, special dishes are made exclusively to be eaten during second breakfast. In Vienna and most other parts of Austria the second breakfast is referred to as Jause. Database of Austrian German. Retrieved 2010-03-19. In other Spanish-speaking countries, almuerzo means lunch, but in Spain it is a second breakfast. It is typical to eat four to five meals a day in these locations. ==Details== The second breakfast is typically a lighter meal or snack eaten around 10:00 in the morning (its Hungarian and Slovak names, t√≠z√≥rai and desiata respectively, actually mean \\"[snack] at 10\\"). It consists of coffee and either pastries or sausages. The typical sausage is a white sausage, Wei√üwurst, which is considered the specialty of Munich and Bavaria in general. The sausage is prepared during the early morning to serve during the second breakfast. It is served with pretzels, sweet mustard, and wheat beer. The meal is roughly similar in concept to the British elevenses. In Poland second breakfast usually consists of some snacks like sandwiches, or pastries, but may consist of light dessert- type dishes like chocolate pudding or kisiel. First and second breakfast is also a common custom in farm areas of North America. Farmers who need to rise early to tend to animals or perform other chores may eat a small \\"first breakfast\\", such as toast and coffee, just after rising, followed by a heartier second breakfast after the first round of chores is done. ==In literature and film== In J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit, the protagonist Bilbo Baggins eats a second breakfast, and in the preface to its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien mentions that hobbits prefer to eat six meals a day. In Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring, as Aragorn is leading the hobbits on a march, Pippin ‚Äì hoping for a meal break ‚Äì is horrified when Merry tells him that the man probably doesn't know about second breakfast. Pippin goes on to ask if he knows about the other meals commonly eaten by hobbits, including elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper. Aragorn throws an apple to each of the pair to tide them over until their next \\"regular\\" meal break. However, in the book Hobbits are specifically described as eating \\"six meals a day (when they [can] get them)\\", not seven. In Thomas Mann's books The Magic Mountain and Buddenbrooks, frequent and detailed references are made to second breakfasts. Sometimes food from the first breakfast appears again such as oatmeal and fruit. In fact, in Magic Mountain, Mann even refers to \\"third breakfasts\\". The \\"second breakfast\\" is referenced in the American version of The Office, in the season 6 episode \\"The Delivery\\", by Kevin Malone: > \\"Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times so we've been eating > together a lot.

He became a friend of Michael Nesmith, who had played with him (mostly bass guitar) in several working bands. He accompanied Nesmith and then-wife Phyllis Barbour to California to try their luck in the Los Angeles-area music scene. When Nesmith was cast in The Monkees, he recruited London as his stand-in on the set, and when the originally-fictitious band began playing on their own recordings, London sometimes served as bassist, allowing Peter Tork to play keyboards, banjo, or another instrument. London also co-wrote \\"Don't Call On Me\\" with Nesmith, which was featured on Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. and a second-season TV episode, and appeared in bit parts on the show. London also played bass for other L.A.-based bands. In 1970, he and Nesmith, who had decided to leave the Monkees, formed a new group with pedal steel guitar ace Red Rhodes and drummer John Ware. Calling themselves the First National Band, the group signed with RCA Records. While praised for their country rock innovations, the band had little commercial success, and eventually broke up. Years after the Monkees and the First National Band, London served as key grip on several different productions, including 48 Hrs., Who Will Love My Children?, The Karate Kid, Long Time Gone, and Hudson Hawk.

It is situated on the southside of the River Liffey, between Ringsend to the north and Sandymount to the south, and is to the east of the River Dodder. ==History== Irishtown grew outside of Dublin, about 2 KM west of the medieval city walls (see also Ringsend). Dublin was originally a Viking city and after 1171, when an Anglo- Norman army seized it, Dublin became the centre of English rule in Ireland. The native Gaelic Irish were therefore viewed as an alien force in the city, and suspicion of them was deepened by continual raids on Dublin and its environs by the O'Byrne and O'Toole clans from the nearby Wicklow Mountains. By the 15th century, Gaelic migration to the city had made the English authorities fearful that English language and culture would become a minority there. As a result, the Irish inhabitants of Dublin were expelled from the city proper in about 1454, in line with the Statutes of Kilkenny. The Irish population were only allowed to trade inside the city limits by daylight. At the end of the day's trading, they would leave and set up camp in what was to become known as \\"the Irishtown\\". Later, Irishtown formed part of the Pembroke Urban District. At the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, Irishtown was the location of the Waxies' Dargle, an annual outing by Dublin cobblers (\\"waxies\\"), which a well-known folk song recalls.

It is one of the four stations located in Belfast City Centre, the others being Great Victoria Street, City Hospital and Botanic. Located on East Bridge Street, off of the Albert Bridge, in the city, Lanyon Place is the northern terminus of the cross border Enterprise service to Dublin Connolly, which runs every two hours. As well as this service, Lanyon Place is also served by Northern Ireland Railways, which operates routes to other locations in Northern Ireland, including Derry, Bangor, Portadown and Larne. ==Description== There are two island platforms at Lanyon Place, each serving two tracks, capable of accommodating trains up to nine coaches long on each side. Platform 1 is usually only used at peak hours, as well as for special services run by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland. Platform 2 is the Enterprise platform. Platform 3 is the 'southbound platform', normally used for trains to Great Victoria Street, Portadown, Lisburn and Newry, with Platform 4 being the 'northbound platform' for trains along the Derry, Larne and Bangor lines. Regular services also operate between Lanyon Place and the city's other main station, Great Victoria Street which is located nearer to Belfast's city centre. 2.6 million people used the station in 2017. ==History== The station was opened as \\"Belfast Central\\" on Monday 26 April 1976, despite it being located further from Belfast city centre than Great Victoria Street station. The first station manager was Mr John Johnston. By the 1990s, it became clear that the station's facilities were in need of upgrading. A major refurbishment programme started in 2000 and was completed in 2003. In February 2018, Translink announced that Belfast Central would undergo a face-lift. This would see the entrance hall and East Bridge Street fa√ßade completely redesigned, with the removal of the blast wall. Inside, the ticket hall would be rebuilt and new retail and dining facilities provided. A Belfast Bikes dock will also be included in the redesigned station. As part of the redesign, Belfast Central was renamed Lanyon Place on 1 September 2018. This is despite the fact that, strictly speaking, the station is not located there but on East Bridge Street. It is expected that the Enterprise will move from Lanyon Place to the new transport hub at Great Victoria Street once that project is completed. ==Service== Main hall of Belfast Central (prior to refurbishment as Lanyon Place) Train departing from Lanyon Place NIR Class 3000 (C3K) train in Lanyon Place ===Newry‚ÄìBelfast‚ÄìBangor line=== From Monday to Saturday, there is a half hourly service from Bangor to Portadown, with some trains continuing on to Newry.

The service is reduced to hourly operation in the evenings. Some early morning trains in either direction will terminate at or start from Great Victoria Street rather than continuing on through Belfast to the respective outlying terminus. On Sundays, the service is hourly operating between Bangor and Portadown. There are no local services calling at stations between Portadown and Newry on Sundays. ===Larne line=== Inbound Larne Line services run half- hourly to . Outbound services run half-hourly on an alternating basis to either or on to . Extra services at peak times run to , and some early morning and late night inbound trains terminate here. At weekends, the service still runs half-hourly on Saturdays on the same alternating pattern to Whitehead or Larne Harbour. On Sundays, the service reduces to hourly operation, with the outbound terminus alternating every hour as before. ===Derry~Londonderry line=== All Derry~Londonderry Line trains call at Lanyon Place. During the week, the service runs hourly in each direction between and or on an alternating basis. On Saturdays, the service is slightly reduced, however operation remains much the same as during the week. On Sundays, the hourly service alternately runs to Derry~Londonderry and Portrush. ===Dublin line=== There is an Enterprise train service every two hours between Dublin Connolly and Lanyon Place with the service being reduced to five trains each way on Sundays. This line can be popular with rugby fans connecting at for the DART to Lansdowne Road. The line is also used by rail passengers changing at Dublin Connolly onto the DART to D√∫n Laoghaire for example or travelling to Dublin Port for the Irish Ferries or Stena Line to Holyhead, and then by train along the North Wales Coast Line to London Euston and other destinations in England and Wales. ==Rail and Sea Connections== ===Port of Belfast=== The Port of Belfast has a Stena Line ferry connecting to Cairnryan for the bus link to Stranraer and onward trains along the Glasgow South Western Line to Glasgow Central. ===Port of Larne=== The Larne line connects with Larne Harbour with P&O; Ferries sailing to Cairnryan for the bus link to Stranraer and onward trains along the Glasgow South Western Line to Glasgow Central, as well as alternative sailings by P&O; Ferries to Troon also on the Glasgow South Western Line to Glasgow Central. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Belfast Category:Railway stations opened in 1976 Category:Railway stations served by NI Railways Category:Railway stations served by Enterprise Category:Railway stations opened by NI Railways Category:1976 establishments in Northern Ireland ","title":"Lanyon Place railway station"},{"id":"3256547","text":"The 3 arrondissements of the Val-d'Oise department are: # Arrondissement of Argenteuil, (subprefecture: Argenteuil) with 17 communes.

Brumley and published in 1932 by the Hartford Music company in a collection titled Wonderful Message.Richard Matteson, Jr., The Bluegrass Picker's Tune Book, Mel Bay Publications, 2006 (accessed at Google books on March 4, 2011) Brumley's writing was influenced by the 1924 secular ballad, \\"The Prisoner's Song\\". \\"I'll Fly Away\\" has been called the most recorded gospel song, and it is frequently used in worship services by Baptists, Pentecostals, Nazarenes, the Churches of Christ and many Methodists.Joe Edwards, 'I'll Fly Away' hymn classic, Associated Press/Kentucky New Era, March 13, 1987, page 4D It appears in many hymnals where it is listed under the topics of eternal life, heaven and acceptance. It is a standard song at bluegrass jam sessions and is often performed at funerals. ==History== Albert E. Brumley has been described as the \\"pre-eminent gospel songwriter\\" of the 20th century with over 600 published songs. Other popular songs by Brumley include \\"Jesus, Hold My Hand\\", \\"Turn Your Radio On\\", \\"I'll Meet You in the Morning\\", and \\"This World Is Not My Home\\". According to interviews, Brumley came up with the idea for the song while picking cotton on his father's farm in Rock Island, Oklahoma. Brumley says that as he worked he was \\"humming the old ballad that went like this: 'If I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly,' and suddenly it dawned on me that I could use this plot for a gospel-type song.\\" The song Brumley described appears to be \\"The Prisoner's Song\\".W.K. McNeil, Encyclopeida of American Gospel Music, Routlage, 2005, page 54 It was an additional three years later until Brumley worked out the rest of the song, paraphrasing one line from the secular ballad to read, \\"Like a bird from prison bars has flown\\" using prison as a metaphor for earthly life. Brumley has stated, \\"When I wrote it, I had no idea that it would become so universally popular.\\" Other earlier nineteenth century slave songs also contained similar lyrics, stating: \\"I'll fly away to glory; I'll fly away to my heavenly home, And I'll shout glory.\\"\\"The Freedmen of Sixty Years Ago,\\" The Ladies Repository, (L.

It is the southwestern palace, and since 1885, has been used to accommodate and entertain prominent guests, for receptions, and for ceremonial purposes.The Danish Monarchy & Amalienborg ‚Äì In and Around Copenhagen and Denmark ‚Äì Copenhagenet.dk. Retrieved 16 February 2012. ==History== Map of Amalienborg (Frederik's Church is also shown) Moltke's Palace, currently known as Christian VII's Palace, was originally built for Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke. Between his two wives, Moltke was said to have had 22 sons, five of whom became cabinet ministers, four who became ambassadors, two who became generals, and all of whom went into public service. According to Eigtved‚Äôs master plans for Frederikstad and the Amalienborg Palaces, the four palaces surrounding the plaza were conceived of as town mansions for the families of chosen nobility. Their exteriors were identical, but interiors differed. The site on which the aristocrats could build was given to them free of charge, and they were further exempted from taxes and duties. The only conditions were that the palaces should comply exactly to the Frederikstad architectural specifications, and that they should be built within a specified time framework. Motke's Palace was erected in 1750‚Äì54 by the best craftsmen and artists of their day under the supervision of Eigtved. It was the most expensive of the four palaces at the time it was built, and had the most extravagant interiors. Its Great Hall (Riddersalen) featured woodcarvings (boiserie) by Louis August le Clerc, paintings by Fran√ßois Boucher and stucco by Giovanni Battista Fossati, and is acknowledged widely as perhaps the finest Danish Rococo interior. On 30 March 1754, the mansion formally opened coinciding with the King‚Äôs thirtieth birthday. Due to Eigtved's death a few months later, final work such as the Banqueting Hall, was completed by Nicolas-Henri Jardin. The four palaces are: * Moltke's Palace, now known as Christian VII's Palace * Levetzau's Palace, now known as Christian VIII's Palace * Brockdorff's Palace, now known as Frederick VIII's Palace * Schack's Palace, now known as Christian IX's Palace ===Royal residence=== Immediately after the Christiansborg Palace fire in March 1794, and two years after the death of Moltke, the royal family, headed by the schizophrenic King Christian VII, purchased the first of the four palaces to be sold to the royal family, and commissioned Caspar Frederik Harsdorff to turn it into a royal residence. They occupied the new residence December 1794. After Christian VII‚Äôs death in 1808, Frederick VI used the palace for his Royal Household. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs used parts of the Palace in the years 1852‚Äì1885. For short periods of time in the intervening years the palace has housed various members of the royal family while restoration took place on their respective palaces. In 1971‚Äì1975 a small kindergarten was established at the palace, and later a schoolroom, for Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim. ===Restoration=== After 200 years the facade, decorated by German sculptor Johan Christof Petzold, was severely damaged, causing parts of Amalienborg Place to be closed to prevent injury. In 1982, exterior and interior restoration began that completed in early 1996, Copenhagen's year as European Capital of Culture. In 1999, Europa Nostra, an international preservation organisation, acknowledged the restoration with by presenting a medal. Currently, the palace is one of two, along with the Christian VIII's Palace, that is open to the public. ==See also== * Amalienborg * Adam Gottlob Moltke ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * This work in turn cites: * H.H.

He made over 1,000 appearances at various levels, including 314 in the Football League alone for Coventry City, and more than 160 apiece in the competition for Blackpool and Swansea City (serving the latter as manager for a season before resuming as a player, which continued into his mid-40s), plus shorter spells in the United States and Hong Kong. Hutchison gained 17 caps for Scotland between 1973 and 1975. ==Club career== Born in Cardenden, Fife, Hutchison began his professional career with Alloa Athletic in the Scottish Second Division, after he was spotted by manager Archie McPherson. He showed enough potential to attract the attention of larger clubs, and he joined Stan Mortensen's Blackpool in February 1968 for just over ¬£10,000. Almost immediately, he took the place of Graham Oates at outside-left, making his debut against Plymouth on 30 March in the English Second Division. The Scot was brought in to bolster the Seasiders flagging promotion drive, and out of the final nine games of the 1967‚Äì68 season, they won eight. Promotion, however, was missed on the final day.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887‚Äì1992, p. 98. Breedon Books Sport. Les Shannon took over from Mortensen as manager, and in his first season achieved promotion to the First Division in 1970 ‚Äì but it only lasted one season. When Bob Stokoe took over from Shannon in June 1971, he worked on Hutchison's crossing ability, believing it to be his only weak spot. In 1972, Coventry City manager Joe Mercer offered ¬£140,000 cash plus Billy Rafferty for Hutchison's services. He signed for the Midlands club, leaping at the chance to play in the First Division on a regular basis. 'Hutch' remained at Highfield Road for eight years, playing 355 games and scoring 30 goals. During his time at Coventry he played probably the best football of his career, winning all of his 17 Scottish caps while at the club. Nicknamed \\"Mr Magic\\" by the club chairman, Derrick Robins, he was voted supporter's Player of the Season three times during his eight-year spell at Highfield Road ‚Äì a feat no other Sky Blues player has yet equalled. Hutchison joined Manchester City for a fee of ¬£47,000 in October 1980, becoming John Bond's first signing at Maine Road. In May 1981, he scored for both sides in the FA Cup Final, as Tottenham Hotspur drew 1‚Äì1 with Manchester City. He was not the first to do this ‚Äî Bert Turner had done so in the 1946 final for Charlton and Derby, and Gary Mabbutt would do the same in the 1987 final for Coventry City and Tottenham Hotspur. He had initially put City in the lead, but his own goal (deflecting a free- kick) meant that the final would go to a replay, which City lost 3‚Äì2 five days later. Hutchison later played for Bulova of Hong Kong and Seattle Sounders (US) before returning to the UK, re-joining John Bond at Burnley in 1983 and moving to Swansea City in 1985 to be managed by Bond at a third different club in his career. When Bond departed, Hutchison served as manager for six months after the club went into liquidation. Come September 1989, Hutchison ‚Äì now just shy of his 42nd birthday ‚Äì made his debut in European club competition. Having won the Welsh FA Cup the season before, Swansea entered the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup, and were drawn against Greek giants Panathinaikos. They were eliminated at the First Round stage, but not before giving the Greek team a scare losing 3‚Äì2 in Athens and drawing 3‚Äì3 at Vetch Field. He is in the record books as the oldest player to have played for Swansea City, playing against Southend United in March 1991 at the age of 43 years, five months and 19 days. In late-May and early-June 1984, Hutchison made three guest appearances for Manchester United on their summer tour of Australia, playing against Australia, Nottingham Forest and Juventus. He then made another guest appearance for the club the following May, when he played in Peter Foley's testimonial against an Oxford United XI. He left Swansea near the end of the 1990‚Äì91 season, and joined Southern League side Merthyr Tydfil, where he spent another three years before finally retiring from the game in May 1994, at the age of 46, having played more than a thousand first-team games in his career. ==Blackpool F.C. Hall of Fame== Hutchison was inducted into the Hall of Fame at Bloomfield Road, when it was officially opened by former Blackpool player Jimmy Armfield in April 2006. Organised by the Blackpool Supporters Association, Blackpool fans around the world voted on their all-time heroes. Five players from each decade are inducted; Hutchison is in the 1970s. ==International career== Capped 17 times for Scotland, Hutchison appeared at the 1974 World Cup, though was surprisingly omitted from the 1978 World Cup squad in Argentina when he was arguably playing the finest football of his career. ==Retirement== On retiring from league football at the age of 43, he joined non-league Merthyr Tydfil where he played for three seasons, finally hanging-up his boots in 1994. He remained in South Wales until 2012, working as a Football Development Officer across the Severn Estuary for Bristol City, but moved back to live in Scotland. A poll by the Coventry Evening Telegraph voted him the most popular Coventry player of the club's First Division era. ==Honours== === As a player === Blackpool *Anglo-Italian Cup: 1971 Seattle Sounders *North American Soccer League National Conference Western Division Champions 1980 Manchester City *FA Cup: Finalist 1981 Bulova SA *Hong Kong FA Cup: 1983 *Hong Kong Viceroy Cup: 1983 Swansea City *Welsh FA Cup: 1988-89 === As an individual === * Coventry City Hall of Fame ==See also== *List of footballers in England by number of league appearances (500+) *List of footballers with the most official appearances (1000+) ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * * *Hutchison in the Blackpool Supporters Association Hall of Fame *Tommy Hutchison visits Highbridge in Somerset * Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Alloa Athletic F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players Category:Bulova SA players Category:Expatriate footballers in Hong Kong Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Merthyr Tydfil F.C. players Category:Scotland international footballers Category:1974 FIFA World Cup players Category:Seattle Sounders (1974‚Äì1983) players Category:Hong Kong First Division League players Category:Scottish football managers Category:Scottish expatriate footballers Category:Swansea City A.F.C. managers Category:English Football League players Category:People from Cardenden Category:Sportspeople from Fife Category:Scotland under-23 international footballers Category:Dundonald Bluebell F.C. players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Scottish expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Scottish Football League players ","title":"Tommy Hutchison"},{"id":"3256608","text":"Rancocas Farm was an American thoroughbred horse racing stud farm and racing stable located on Monmouth Road (County Road 537) in the Jobstown section of Springfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey. ==Pierre Lorillard IV== The farm was founded in the 1870s by the wealthy tobacco manufacturer Pierre Lorillard IV (1833-1901) who had a home in the town of Rancocas, now a part of Westampton Township, New Jersey. Lorillard built his stable into one of the premier thoroughbred breeding and training operations in the United States. Lorillard bred Parole, one of the three greatest runners of the 1870s. In 1881, Lorillard's horse Iroquois became the first American-owned and -bred horse to win a European classic race.

Livingston== On the death of Pierre Lorillard, Rancocas Stable was inherited by Lillian \\"Lily\\" Barnes-Allen-Livingston.New York Times - December 12, 1908 She later sold it to Kansas oil industrialist Harry F. Sinclair and moved to Canada where she set up her own breeding and racing operation that would see her inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2011.Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame ==Harry Ford Sinclair== Harry Sinclair would invest considerable funds to continue the Rancocas breeding and racing success, making it one of the dominant racing stables in the United States during the 1920s. For Sinclair, trainer Sam Hildreth brought the stable victories in the Kentucky Derby and in three Belmont Stakes. Between 1923 and 1929 the stable had six horses compete in the Preakness Stakes but never managed a win. Two of the stable's colts, Grey Lag and Zev, are in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. After their racing careers, both Purchase and Lucullite stood there. Such was the fame of Rancocas Stable that the Pennsylvania Railroad named baggage car #5858 in its honor. Among the jockeys who rode for Rancocas Stable were Hall of Famers Earl Sande and Laverne Fator. Sinclair's Rancocas Stable set the record as top money winner in a single season in 1923 that stood until 1941 when it was broken by Calumet Farm. Personal problems culminating in a prison term for his part in what became known in American history as the Teapot Dome scandal (Sinclair sold US oil reserves to private interests for his own aggrandizement), forced Harry Sinclair to sell his horses and the farm. ==William Helis== In 1943, William Helis purchased the farm Milwaukee Journal - August 29, 1944 and in 1946 acquired adjoining acreage to bring it up to .Miami News - June 11, 1946 On his death in 1950, management of the property was taken over by his son, William Jr. who was also involved in racing.

It was part of the Loire Campaign during the Hundred Years' War, where Charles VII's forces successfully recaptured much of the region following their victory at the siege of Orleans. The battle ended in victory for Charles VII and is notable as Joan of Arc's first offensive battle. ==Background== By the end of 1428, during the later years of the Hundred Years' War, the English and their allies from the Burgundian faction had occupied almost all of France North of the Loire River. Many strategic points along the Loire had also been seized, and Orl√©ans, the last major city on the river, had been under siege since October of that year (1428). If the English had been able to secure complete control of the Loire valley, the southern part of France, the last remaining position of the Dauphin would be open to invasion. In early March 1429, Joan of Arc arrived at Chinon to meet with Charles VII and, after being examined by church officials in Poitiers, joined a large force which set out to relieve the siege at Orl√©ans. This operation proved successful as the siege was lifted by 9 May. Following the lifting of the siege of Orl√©ans, Charles VII's forces spent the next month or so recruiting and growing in strength for the next phase of military operations. In early June, at a meeting of French military leaders in the presence of Charles VII, it was decided to pursue a strategy of clearing the Loire River valley of English troops. The Bridge at Orleans had been destroyed by the English at the end of the siege. The other bridges on the Loire (including Jargeau) were in English hands. The army was assembled at Orl√©ans where Joan rejoined them on 9 June. That same day, they departed for Jargeau. Meanwhile, on 8 June, Sir John Fastolf finally left Paris with a reinforcing army of several thousand, headed for the Loire River valley. ==Setting== Jargeau was a small town on the southern bank of the Loire river in central France, about ten miles east of Orl√©ans. Conquered by the English a few years earlier as a staging point for a planned invasion of southern France, the city was defended by a wall with several towers and fortified gates. A ditch just on the outside of the walls further enhanced the defenses. Outside the walls, suburbs had grown. There was a single fortified bridge, of strategic significance during the latter part of the war, crossing the Loire River to the north bank. The city was defended by approximately 700 troops armed with gunpowder weaponry. ==Battle== Charles' VII's army included commanders such as Jean d'Orl√©ans, Gilles de Rais, Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, and La Hire. The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole led the English defense of the town. The battle began with a French assault on the suburbs. English defenders left the city walls and the French fell back. Joan of Arc used her standard to begin a French rally. The English retreated to the city walls and the French lodged in the suburbs for the night. The following morning Joan of Arc called upon the defenders to surrender. They refused. The French followed with a heavy artillery bombardment using primitive cannons and siege engines. One of the town's towers fell. Suffolk entered surrender negotiations with a minor French captain, La Hire. This breach of protocol antagonized the French command. Joan of Arc initiated an assault on the town walls, surviving a stone projectile that shattered against her helmet, knocking her to the ground. The English suffered heavy losses with the French executing those they took prisoner. ==See also== *Jargeau *Medieval warfare *French military history ==References== ==Bibliography== * DeVries, Kelly.

A principal branch of the Liparitid house, known later under the name of Orbeli or Orbeliani, were expelled, in 1177 after a failed coup to Armenia where they came to be known as the Orbelian Dynasty, and controlled Syunik and Vayots Dzor until the Invasions of Tamerlane. That said: the family gave origin to several cadet branches which have survived in Georgia for several centuries. ==Origins== The Liparitids are believed by Cyril Toumanoff and some other modern scholars to have been descended from one of the fugitive princes of the Armenian Mamikonid dynasty.Toumanoff, Cyril. \\"The Mamikonids and the Liparitids\\", Armeniaca (Venice, 1969), pp. 125-137. This hypothesis is not commonly shared by the scholars in Georgia who believe the family to have been native to the western Georgian district of Argveti whence they were ousted by the kings of Abkhazia in the 870s. –õ–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å—å –ö–∞—Ä—Ç–ª–∏ / –ü–µ—Ä., –≤–≤–µ–¥. –∏ –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—á. –ì. –¶—É–ª–∞–∏–∞; [–†–µ–¥. —Ç–æ–º–∞ –®. –ë–∞–¥—Ä–∏–¥–∑–µ], –¢–±.: –ú–µ—Ü–Ω–∏–µ—Ä–µ–±–∞, 1982. Either way, the dynasty, in the person of its eponymous founder, Liparit I, established themselves in the province of Trialeti in southern Georgia (Lower Iberia) c. 876. In Georgia, they received the moniker of \\"Baghuashi\\", probably derived from baghva, an archaic Georgian word for \\"ravaging\\" (cf. Orbeliani, Sulkhan-Saba, Dictionary, 4.4: 101. Tbilisi, 1965 [in Georgian]), which eventually firmly attached to the family. –¶—É–ª–∞—è, –ì–∏–≤–∏. –ò–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –≥—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –∞–≥–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏: \\"–ú—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–∞ –∏ –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞\\". –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏–µ.Ru. Retrieved on May 24, 2007. ==Early history== In their new fiefdom, the Liparitids accepted the suzerainty of David I Kuropalates, a Georgian Bagratid prince of Iberia based in Tao-Klarjeti, and built a stronghold called Klde-Karni on a strategic mountain of the Trialeti Range. This area lay in the possessions of David's kinsman Guaram Mampali, and the move eventually led to a split among the Bagratids which concluded with the murder of David by his nephew (son of Guaram Mampali) Nasra in 881. In a civil war that ensued, Liparit supported David's heir, Adarnase I, who was victorious and crowned, with the Armenian support, as King of the Georgians in 888. Thus, Liparit and his heirs secured a hereditary dukedom of Trialeti and Kldekari. They quickly rose in prominence, gaining more possessions and prestige and when, in the early 11th century, the Bagratid dynasty established the unified all-Georgian monarchy, the Liparitids were among its most powerful vassals and rivals. ==Struggle with the Bagratids== In the mid-eleventh century, the Liparitid house reached the apogee of their might and remained, for a century, leaders of the feudality in its struggle against the growing power of the kings of Georgia. In 1047, one of the most illustrious representatives of the family, Liparit IV, even succeeded in temporarily driving King Bagrat IV into the Byzantine territory. The kings of Georgia had to concede more possessions and titles to the family in order to pacify a series of the Liparitid rebellions. In the 1093, David IV of Georgia defeated Liparit IV and expelled him into the Byzantine Empire, absorbing the Liparitid duchy into royal domain. After their expulsion from Georgia, several Liparitids also were active in the Byzantine military and administrative service in the 12th century. –ö–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω, –ê. –ü.

Around 1110, the family, their principal branch being known under the name of Orbeli or Orbeliani after the castle of Orbeti, was restored in the part of their possessions, but their tendency to rebellion against the crown did not quell. In 1177, Ivane Orbeli headed an abortive insurrection against George III of Georgia on behalf of his son-in-law and George's nephew Demna. The victorious king killed all members of the Orbeli clan, except two brothers who escaped. One brother, Ivane, succeeded in restoring part of his family's holdings in Georgia during the reign of queen Tamar (1184-1213). The other brother, Elikum, fled to the Atabegs of Azerbaijan and became Muslim, becoming a prominent Bey. His descendants ‚Äî Orbelian ‚Äî eventually gained control of the Armenian principality of Syunik and reconverted to Christianity. A cadet branch of the Liparitid house, the Kakhaberisdze, was enfeoffed of Racha and Takveri in northwestern Georgia, from the 11th or 12th century to the 13th, though they appear to have maintained themselves in it till the 15th.Toumanoff, Cyril. \\"The Fifteenth-Century Bagratids and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia.\\" Traditio: Studies in Ancient and Medieval History, Thought and Religion 7 (1949‚Äì51): 169‚Äì222.

In the mid-1980s, he worked as an account representative for J. Walter Thompson, an ad agency located in New York City. Bohjalian moved with his wife, Victoria Blewer, to Lincoln, Vermont in 1988. In Lincoln, Bohjalian began writing weekly columns for the local newspaper and magazine about living in the small town, which had a population of about 975 residents. The column ran in the Burlington Free Press from 1992 through 2015 and won a Best Lifestyle Column from the Vermont Press Association. Bohjalian has also written for such magazines as Cosmopolitan, Reader's Digest, The New York Times, and the Boston Globe Sunday Magazine. Bohjalian's first novel, A Killing in the Real World, was released in 1988. His third novel, Past the Bleachers, was released in 1992 and was adapted to a Hallmark Channel television movie in 1995. In 1997, Bohjalian's fifth novel, Midwives, was released. The novel focuses on the rural Vermont midwife Sibyl Danforth, who becomes embroiled in a legal battle after one of her patients died following an emergency Caesarean section. The novel was critically acclaimed and was selected by Oprah Winfrey as the October 1998 selection of her Oprah's Book Club. It became a #1 New York Times and #1 USA Today bestseller. In 2001, the novel was adapted into a Lifetime Movie Network television film starring Sissy Spacek in the lead role. Spacek said the Danforth character appealed to her because, \\"the heart of the story is my character's inner struggle with self-doubt, the solo road you travel when you have a secret\\". ==Later career== Bohjalian followed Midwives with the 1998 novel The Law of Similars, about a widower attorney suffering from nameless anxieties who starts dating a woman who practices alternative medicine. The novel was inspired by Bohjalian's real-life visit to a homeopath in an attempt to cure frequent colds he was catching from his daughter's day care center. Bohjalian said of the visit, \\"I don't think I imagined there was a novel in homeopathy, however, until I met the homeopath and she explained to me the protocols of healing. There was a poetry to the language that a patient doesn't hear when visiting a conventional doctor.\\" The protagonist, a father, is based in part on Bohjalian himself, and his four-year-old daughter is based largely on Bohjalian's daughter, who was three when he was writing the book. Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times said in her review, \\"Few writers can manipulate a plot with Bohjalian's grace and power.\\" However, Rosenberg felt that the novel shared too many similarities with Midwives. Rosenberg argued that, \\"unlike its predecessor, it [The Law of Similars] fails to take advantage of Bohjalian's great gift for creating thoughtful fiction featuring characters in whom the reader sustains a lively interest.\\" Megan Harlan of The Boston Phoenix described the novel as \\"formulaic fiction\\" and said Bohjalian focused too much on creating a complex plot and not enough of complex characterizations. The Law of Similars, like Midwives, made The New York Times bestsellers list. Bohjalian won the New England Book Award in 2002. The Double Bind was a Barnes & Noble Recommends Selection in 2007 and debuted at #3 on the \\"New York Times\\" bestseller list. In 2008, Bohjalian released Skeletons at the Feast, a love story set in the last six months of World War II in Poland and Germany. The novel was inspired by an unpublished diary written by German citizen Eva Henatsch between the years of 1920 to 1945. The diary was given to Bohjalian in 1998 by Henatsch's grandson Gerd Krahn, a friend of Bohjalian, who had a daughter in the same kindergarten class as Bohjalian's daughter. Bohjalian was particularly fascinated by Henatsch's account of her family's trek west ahead of the Soviet Army, but he was not inspired to write a novel from it until 2006, when he read Armageddon: The Battle for Germany, Max Hastings' history of the final years of World War II. Bohjalian was struck not only by how often Henatsch's story mirrored real-life experiences, but also the common \\"moments of idiosyncratic human connection\\" found in both. Skeletons at the Feast was considered a departure for Bohjalian because it was not only set outside of Vermont, and set in a particular historical moment. The novel was an enormous commercial and critical success: It was Bohjalian's fifth New York Times bestseller and was selected a \\"Best Book of the Year\\" by the Washington Post and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. It was also an NBC Today Show \\"Top Ten\\" summer pick in 2008. His 2009 novel, Secrets of Eden, was also a critical success, receiving starred reviews from three of the four trade journals (Booklist, Library Journal, and Publishers Weekly), as well as many newspapers and magazines. It debuted at # 6 on the New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It premiered as a Lifetime Television movie on February 4, 2012, starring John Stamos, Dorsa Giyahi and Anna Gunn. This was the third time one of Bohjalian's novels was adapted for a movie, following Past the Bleachers in 1995 and Midwives in 2001. His thirteenth novel, The Night Strangers, was published in 2011. It's a ghost story which received excellent critical reviews and drew comparisons to the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Atwood, Alice Sebold, Stephen King, and Ira Levin. But the reader response was mixed, with some readers frustrated with the ending and Bohjalian's use of the second person for parts of the narration. The book won the New England Society Book Award for fiction in April 2012. Bohjalian's The Sandcastle Girls (2012) is about the Armenian Genocide and its century-long denial by Turkey. The novel includes two stories folded into one: the story of Elizabeth Endicott and Armen Petrosian, lovers who meet in Syria during the genocide; and the story of Laura Petrosian, their granddaughter, who after a century tries to understand why they were silent about their youth, while her suburban existence is quite different from the violent setting in which her grandparents fell in love. USA Today proclaimed that Bohjalian makes \\"a near-century-old event come to life in a way that will make readers gasp with shock that such a terrible event ‚Äî Turkey's determination to kill all the Armenians in their country ‚Äî is such a small part of our knowledge of world history\\".Chris Bohjalian's 'Sandcastle Girls' is shaped by history, USA Today, 07-16-12 Oprah Winfrey chose it as a Book of the Week: \\"This rendering of one of history's greatest (and least known) tragedies is a nuanced, sophisticated portrayal of what it means not only to endure but also to insist on hope\\".Book of the Week: The Sandcastle Girls, Oprah.com Since then Bohjalian has written other New York Times bestsellers, including The Light in the Ruins (2013); Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands (2014); The Guest Room (2016); The Sleepwalker (2017); and The Flight Attendant (2018). Bohjalian's books have been chosen as Best Books of the Year by the Washington Post, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the Hartford Courant, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, Kirkus Reviews, Bookpage, and Salon. On September 1, 2017, Bohjalian delivered a Vardanants Day Armenian Lecture at the Library of Congress. ==Writing style== Bohjalian novels often focus on a specific issue, such as homelessness, animal rights and environmentalism, and tend to be character-driven, revolving around complex and flawed protagonists and secondary characters. Bohjalian uses characteristics from his real life in his writings; in particular, many of his novels take place in fictional Vermont towns, and the names of real New Hampshire towns are often used throughout his stories. Bohjalian has said, \\"writers can talk with agonizing hubris about finding their voices, but for me, it was in Vermont that I discovered issues, things that matter to me.\\" His novels also tend to focus on ordinary people facing extraordinarily difficult situations resulting from unforeseen circumstances, often triggered by other parties. ==Personal life== Chris Bohjalian was born to an Armenian father and Swedish mother. His Armenian grandparents were survivors of the Armenian Genocide. On October 13, 1984, Bohjalian married Victoria Schaeffer Blewer during a ceremony at the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City; his brother, Andrew Peter Bohjalian, served as his best man. Chris and Victoria live in Vermont. Their daughter, Grace Experience, is an actress based in Manhattan. ==Published works== *The Red Lotus (2020) *The Flight Attendant (2018) * The Sleepwalker (2017) * The Guest Room (2016) * Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands (2014) * The Light in the Ruins (2013) * The Sandcastle Girls (2012) * The Night Strangers (2011) * Secrets of Eden (2010) * Skeletons at the Feast (2008) * The Double Bind (2007) * Before You Know Kindness (2004) * Idyll Banter: Weekly Excursions to a Very Small Town (2003) * The Buffalo Soldier (2002) * Trans-Sister Radio (2000) * The Law of Similars (1999) * Midwives (1997) * Water Witches (1995) * Past the Bleachers (1992) * Hangman (1991) * A Killing in the Real World (1988) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Interview with Chris Bohjalian in which he talks about his youth, his column and his novels.

She was the author of seventeen books and numerous high-profile articles for magazines such as New York and Vanity Fair. Sheehy played a part in the movement Tom Wolfe called the New Journalism, sometimes known as creative nonfiction, in which journalists and essayists experimented with adopting a variety of literary techniques such as scene setting, dialogue, status details to denote social class, and getting inside the story and sometimes reporting the thoughts of a central character. Many of her books focused on cultural shifts, including Passages (1976), which was named one of the ten most influential books of our times by the Library of Congress.\\"Overview\\". Gail Sheehy. Sheehy penned biographies and character studies of major twentieth- century leaders, including Hillary Clinton, both presidents Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. Her most recent book, Daring: My Passages (Sept. 2014), is a memoir.World Archipelago. \\"Daring: My Passages\\". HarperCollins US. Sheehy's article \\"The Secret of Grey Gardens\\", a cover story from the January 10, 1972 issue of New York, brought the bizarre bohemian life of Jacqueline Kennedy's aunt Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale and cousin Edith \\"Little Edie\\" Bouvier Beale to public attention. Their story was the basis for the film Grey Gardens and a Broadway musical of the same name. ==Early life and education== Gail Sheehy was born in Mamaroneck, New York, to Lillian Rainey Henion and Harold Merritt Henion. Her mother's family was Scotch-Irish. Her grandmother, Agnes Rooney ran away from Northern Ireland to the United States as a mail- order bride. Another part of her mother's family was Scottish and worked the Ulster plantation for English landowners. Growing up, Sheehy was close to her paternal grandmother, Gladys Latham Ovens. Ovens' husband had died of a stroke during the Great Depression‚Äîand after he died, Ovens went to work as a real estate agent in a career that lasted for over 40 years. Ovens bought Sheehy her first typewriter at age 7. When as an adolescent, Sheehy began to sneak into New York City on Saturday mornings to explore, her grandmother kept her secret. In 1958, Sheehy graduated from the University of Vermont with a Bachelor of Arts in English and home economics. She later returned to school in 1970, earning her Master of Arts in journalism from Columbia University, where she studied on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship under the cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead. Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University ==Career== === 1960s === Sheehy's first job after college was working for the J. C. Penney department store chain. Sheehy traveled across the country putting on educational fashion shows for college home economics departments. It was here that Sheehy began writing professionally‚Äîshe wrote for the company's magazines and worked with ad agencies to make informational filmstrips. The next few years, a young married Sheehy supported her husband through medical school and began her work as a journalist. Sheehy moved to Rochester, New York where she found a job as a journalist for the Democrat and Chronicle in 1961. She wrote for the women's page and for the Sunday feature section. Sheehy and her husband then moved to the East Village in New York City. Sheehy became a mother, but continued to work for various publications including the World Telegram for a brief time in 1963 and then the New York Herald Tribune from 1963 to 1966. Sheehy decided to leave her daily reporting job to become a freelance journalist. Sheehy and her husband divorced in 1968. Sheehy participated in a number of important and significant cultural events in the 1960s including covering Robert F. Kennedy's campaign and Woodstock. Sheehy was one of the original contributors to New York magazine and contributed from 1968 through 1977. Clay Felker, founder of the magazine, and Sheehy's future husband, encouraged Sheehy to write \\"big\\" stories; one of the first was following Robert Kennedy on the campaign trail in 1968. She traveled with the campaign to the West Coast and had access to interview Kennedy directly. Sheehy was en route back to New York when Kennedy was assassinated in California. Sheehy covered the rise of amphetamine use in New York after her sister became addicted. Sheehy helped her sister get off drugs and they attended Woodstock in order to hide from her sister's drug pusher. In 1969-70, Sheehy was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to attend graduate school at Columbia University. While there, she studied under professor and anthropologist Margaret Mead who was then in her seventies. Inspired by Mead, Sheehy investigated cultural trends with articles on \\"The Fractured Family\\" in New York magazine. During a commencement speech given at the University of Vermont, Sheehy credited Mead with encouraging her to become a cultural interpreter: 'Whenever you hear about a great cultural phenomenon‚Äîa revolution, an assassination, a notorious trial, an attack on the country‚Äîdrop everything. Get on a bus or train or plane and go there, stand at the edge of the abyss, and look down into it. You will see a culture turned inside out and revealed in a raw state.\\" === 1970s === In the 1970s, Sheehy's portfolio of high profile articles grew and she began to author books. In addition to writing for New York magazine, she also wrote a monthly article for Cosmopolitan--her first story had her travel to India to meet Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his disciples. Several of Sheehy's articles for New York magazine were developed into books. This includes her novel Lovesounds (1970), Panthermania: The Clash of Black against Black in One American City (1971), and Hustling: Prostitution in Our Wide Open Society (1973). Lovesounds is a psychological novel that deals with the dissolution of a marriage based on her own first marriage. Her Random House editor, Nan Talese, suggested that Sheehy use a Rashomon-style for the novel, alternating the story between the wife and husband. Talese also loaned Sheehy the use of an apartment to write in. In 1971, Sheehy wrote a series of articles on prostitution for New York magazine called the \\"Wide Open City.\\" She used the New Journalism style which includes vivid description and narration for the article \\"Redpants and Sugarman.\\" Sheehy later came under fire for fictionalizing a character which was a composite. Clay Felker accepted blame for taking out the paragraph describing the use of composites within the article. Sheehy's story was chronicled in the book Hustling and later made into an NBC 1975 television movie of the same name, starring Jill Clayburgh as Redpants and Lee Remick as the journalist. According to producer, George Pelecanos, Sheehy was the inspiration for a reporter character in the HBO series, The Deuce. The summer of 1971, Sheehy and Felker rented a house in East Hampton. Sheehy and her daughter found an abandoned box of kittens and since they could not take them back to New York, Sheehy's daughter suggested they take the kittens to the \\"witch house\\" across the street. It was there that Sheehy first encountered Little Edie Beale and her mother Big Edie Beale, the reclusive cousins of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis living in a dilapidated 28 room mansion called Grey Gardens. Sheehy spent the next few weekends of that summer on the beach with Little Edie learning about their story. Sheehy profiled the two women in New York magazine in \\"The Secret of Grey Gardens\\". After the article was published, Onassis came forward with a check for $25,000 to help clean up the property. Little Edie and Big Edie were profiled in 1975 in the Grey Gardens documentary by the Maysles brothers. Sheehy traveled to Northern Ireland in 1972 to report on the Irish women involved in the Irish civil rights movement. The British government had created the Special Powers Act that allowed British soldiers to round up Catholic men. The women and family members left behind became fierce fighters. She was next to a young boy right after a march, and as British soldiers moved in, the boy was struck in the face by a bullet. That day, January 30, 1972, became known as Bloody Sunday or the Bogside Massacre. Sheehy was trapped inside a Catholic ghetto which was under the authority of the IRA. She made her escape in a car over pastureland to Dublin. There Sheehy traveled to several safe houses and interviewed Rita O'Hare. The whole experience affected Sheehy deeply and on her return to the States she had a difficult time writing the story and developed a fear of airplanes which she later described as PTSD or posttraumatic stress syndrome. Bloody Sunday Memorial mural, Bogside - geograph.org.uk - 1159267 It was at this time in the mid-seventies that Sheehy began work on her book, Passages. After conducting about forty interviews for a book on couples‚ÄîSheehy noticed a theme within her interviewees who were in their late thirties and early forties. The subjects expressed being unsettled. At this time, Sheehy began studying work by Elliott Jacques on mid-life crisis between the ages of thirty-five and forty as well as works by Erik Ericson on adult life stages. Sheehy coined the term \\"Second Adulthood\\" to describe the equilibrium that follows the crisis. It was during this time that Sheehy's long-time editor Hal Scharlatt died and the book was taken over by Jack Macrae, the publisher of Dutton. Sheehy was awarded a fellowship by the Alicia Patterson Foundation to allow her to finish the book. Sheehy's editor was concerned that the title would make readers think that it meant \\"excerpts,\\" but Sheehy was confident they would understand the title once they read the book. Passages was published in 1976. Sales spread through word-of-mouth when it landed on The New York Times Best Seller List where it would remain for three years. During this time period, Sheehy, as both a writer for New York magazine and Felker's partner, was a front-row witness to Rupert Murdoch's hostile takeover of Clay Felker's New York magazine. Felker was forced out of the magazine. Felker purchased Esquire magazine in 1978 and Sheehy wrote for the magazine including publishing a profile and interview with Anwar Sadat. In 1977, Sheehy became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Sheehy began work on her next book, Pathfinders, in 1978. The book examined the lives of those who had led lives that many would consider to have led full lives, and attained a sense of well- being. In developing the book, Sheehy worked with social psychologists at New York University to develop a Life History questionnaire which was given to many people, including \\"corporate chiefs, congressmen, men & women lawyer, etc.\\" The questionnaire was also published in Redbook and Esquire magazines. Sheehy then conducted hundreds of phone interviews for the book, where she identified that those who attained well-being have a willingness to take risks and have experienced one or more important transitions in their adult years which they handled in an unusual, personal, or creative way. === 1980s === Sheehy began her work with Cambodian refugees in the early 1980s. Sheehy was invited by First Lady Rosalynn Carter to participate with other prominent Americans in a Cambodia Crisis Center. While visiting Thailand in 1981, Felker pointed out a story about a camp of Cambodian orphans which prompted Sheehy to visit the camp. It was at this camp that Sheehy met and later adopted her second daughter, Mohm. Sheehy also worked with Catherine O'Neill to publicize the plight of refugees through the Women's Refugee Commission. Sheehy and Mohm chronicled their journey in the 1986 book, Spirit of Survival. Vanity Fairs editor, Tina Brown, invited Sheehy to write political profiles for the magazine beginning in 1984. Her first profile was of U.S. presidential candidate Gary Hart. Sheehy followed this up with pieces on other presidential candidates including George H. W. Bush, Al Gore, Bob Dole and Jesse Jackson. These profiles also served as the basis for her 1988 book, Character: America's Search for Leadership. Sheehy helped organize the Sag Harbor Initiative with William Pickens, Pat Pickens, and Walter Isaacson among others in 1987. The initiative was initially a three-day event put on by \\"liberal intellectuals and concerned citizens\\" who wanted Americans across the country to hold town meetings to discuss urgent social issues. Isaacson went on to be President and CEO of Aspen Ideas Festival. === 1990s === During the 1990s, Gail Sheehy published five books including Gorbachev: The Making of the Man Who Changed the World (1990), The Silent Passage (1992), New Passages (1995), Understanding Men's Passages (1998), and Hillary's Choice (1999). In 1989, Tina Brown asked Sheehy to expand her character profiles for Vanity Fair to include international figures. Sheehy researched and interviewed both Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev. Her article on Thatcher was published as \\"The Blooming of Margaret Thatcher\\" in 1989. Her profile of Gorbachev made the February 1990 Vanity Fair cover as \\"Red Star: The Man Who Changed the World\\". Sheehy expanded her research on Gorbachev, and published the book The Man Who Changed the World: The Lives of Mikhail S. Gorbachev just as he won the Nobel Peace Prize and a few short months before he was deposed. Charmed by the relationship between Gorbachev and Thatcher, Sheehy also wrote a play based on a fantasy romance called Maggie and Misha. The play was produced as a two-week workshop production off-Broadway. Sheehy published the book The Silent Passage about menopause in 1992. Sheehy noticed that no one was talking about menopause and she, herself, was beginning to experience it. After a June 1992 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, the book went back for a number of reprints and eventually hit the #1 spot on the New York Times bestseller list. Sheehy received a million-dollar advance from Simon & Schuster for the paperback rights. Sheehy and Felker moved to the Bay Area of California in 1994 where Felker taught and founded the Felker Magazine Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Sheehy profiled Hillary Clinton a total of three times for the pages of Vanity Fair in the 1990s, beginning with her time as First Lady and through her run for the New York Senate. The articles and work culminated in the publication of the biography, Hillary's Choice. === 2000s === Despite caring for Felker as he was suffering from cancer, Sheehy continued to write and publish through the 21st century. In 2006, she published Sex and the Seasoned Woman in which she interviewed \\"over 400 women from the ages of 23 through 98.\\" She published an article with Parade magazine, \\"Who Cares for the Caregiver?\\" After Felker's death in 2008, Sheehy was named AARP's Caregiving Ambassador in 2008 and began working with the AARP on a series of articles, interviews of caregivers through video, and blog posts. She eventually wrote a book on the subject of caregiving, Passages in Caregiving: Turning Chaos into Confidence which was published in 2010. She also wrote a play, Chasing the Tiger, about her relationship with Felker. Sheehy published her own memoir in 2014, Daring: My Passages. == Personal life == In 1960 Sheehy married Albert Francis Sheehy, a medical student at the University of Rochester. They had one daughter, Maura, and divorced in 1968. In 1984 Sheehy married editor Clay Felker, with whom she adopted a Cambodian child, Mohm. Felker died in 2008. Sheehy died in Southampton, New York, on August 24, 2020, from complications of pneumonia at age 83.Gail Sheehy, Author of Passages, Dies at 83 (KAAL-TV) ==Selected articles== === 1969: \\"Speed City: The Explosion of Amphetamines\\", New York magazine === Sheehy wrote the cover story for New York magazine about the growing problem of amphetamine use among young people in East Village. The article arose out of Sheehy's own experience‚Äîher sister had become addicted to the drug. The cover for the story was created by Milton Glaser of a snake writhing out of a drug capsule. === 1971: \\"Redpants and Sugarman\\", New York magazine === Sheehy gained notoriety in 1971 after New York magazine published a series she wrote about prostitution called \\"Wide Open City\\". Part 2 is called \\"Redpants and Sugarman\\". Sheehy told The Washington Post that she had created a \\"composite character\\" for \\"Redpants\\" in order to trace the full life cycle of a streetwalker, but the explanation was edited out of the story. ===1989: \\"The Blooming of Margaret Thatcher\\", Vanity Fair=== Published in June 1989: French President Francois Mitterrand says Britain's prime minister \\"has eyes like Caligula and the mouth of Marilyn Monroe.\\" She also has the nerves of a five- star general and increasingly, the sexual charisma of a woman in her prime. She manipulates her court of bedazzled male advisors with the skill of Elizabeth I. And as she completes her unparalleled tenth year in office, the most powerful woman in the world has vanquished the opposition, gagged the media, and booted out the critics in her own party. So who is there left to tell her when she goes too far? ===1992: \\"What Hillary Wants\\", Vanity Fair=== Sheehy's 1992 article on Hillary Clinton created a stir by quoting her mentioning rumors of an affair between President George H. W. Bush and a woman named \\"Jennifer\\". Sheehy reported that Clinton complained that the media had made much about Gennifer Flowers' affair with Bill Clinton but did not look into the Bush transgression. Clinton considered that portion of the interview off the record, but Sheehy disagreed, and independently confirmed the \\"private conversation\\" Hillary had described by interviewing Hillary's confidante, Atlanta Journal & Constitution owner Anne Cox Chambers, who repeated the conversation word for word. Fact checkers for Vanity Fair alerted editor Tina Brown to a potential problem, based on their review of the transcript of the interview, but Brown declined to remove the quote. The interview received wide coverage in the press. ===1995: \\"The Inner Quest of Newt Gingrich\\", Vanity Fair=== Sheehy learned the back story of Newt Gingrich's life from his mother, who revealed that she was a lifelong manic-depressive. Kit Gingrich's first husband abandoned young Newt to a stepfather in exchange for forgiveness of a few months of child-support payments. \\"Isn't it awful, a man willing to sell off his own son?\\" Kit Gingrich told Sheehy. Speaker of the House Gingrich told Sheehy that both his fathers were totalitarian and modeled \\"a very male kind of toughness\\". He did not blink when Sheehy asked him if he thought he had a genetic predisposition to bipolar disorder. He said he did not know, then applauded the special powers of leaders who are thought to have been bipolar. \\"Churchill had what he called his 'black dog'. Lincoln had long periods of depression.\\" He speculated that leaders who are able to think on several levels at once may have a different biochemical makeup. \\"You have to have a genetic toughness just to take the beating\\" he told Sheehy. Her article also revealed that his wife at the time, Marianne Gingrich, did not want him to become president and threatened to make a revelation that would torpedo his 1995 presidential campaign. ===2000: \\"The Accidental Candidate: George W. Bush\\", Vanity Fair=== Sheehy found a possible source of the malapropisms for which Governor Bush was mocked: a history of dyslexia in the Bush family. Diagnostic experts told her that \\"The errors you've heard Governor Bush make are consistent with dyslexia,\\" and that \\"a language-disordered person cannot take in a lot of information at once.\\" Sheehy predicted that if Bush became President, \\"he would have to develop a work-style where others pre-organized and pre-digested information for him.\\" Karl Rove and Dick Cheney, she suggested, organized much of the candidate's speeches and decisions. ===2008: \\"Hillaryland at War\\", Vanity Fair=== Published June 30, 2008: Hillary Clinton's campaign had it all: near-death moments, hard-won triumphs, dysfunctional relationships‚Äîand a staff consumed with infighting over how to sell their candidate. It was a battle that revealed why she came so close to victory, as well as why she did not make it. ===Professional affiliations=== In 2009 Sheehy was named AARP's Caregiver Ambassador. In 2011 she became a Chairwoman for the National Osteoporosis Foundation's \\"Generations of Strength\\" campaign. ===Television and other media appearances=== Sheehy was a frequent guest on NBC's The Today Show, MSNBC's Hardball and What Now? with Andrea Mitchell, ABC's World News Tonight with Diane Sawyer, Good Morning America, Oprah, CBS Sunday Morning, CNN, Larry King Live, Fox News, The O'Reilly Factor, and documentaries such as PBS's \\"American Experience: Clinton\\". In July 2015, Sheehy appeared for an interview on Huffpost Live to discuss her 2014 work, Daring. ===Plagiarism lawsuit=== Sheehy's book Passages was a national bestseller. In 1975 Roger Gould, then a psychiatrist at the University of California at Los Angeles, brought a suit, which was settled out of court, against Sheehy intended to enjoin publication of her book, which had not yet been completed. Sheehy ended up giving Dr. Gould ten percent of the royalties for the book. ===Awards and recognition=== * Seven-time recipient of New York Newswomen's Club Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism * Washington Journalism Review Award for Best Magazine Writer in America * New York Public Library Literary Lions Award * 1973 National Magazine Award for Report Excellence * 1975 Penney-Missouri Award *1987 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for The Spirit of Survival *1994 Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Dartmouth *1997 Hospital for Special Surgery Award For Groundbreaking Work in Women's Health *2002 American Psychological Association's Presidential Citation *2011 American Society on Aging Leadership Award A Library of Congress survey named Passages one of the 10 most-influential books of our time. ==Bibliography== Non-fiction *Speed is of the Essence (1971), *Panthermania:The Clash of Black Against Black in One American City (1971) *Hustling: Prostitution in Our Wide Open Society (1973) *Passages: Predictable Crises of Adult Life (1976) *Pathfinders: Overcoming the Crises of Adult Life (1983) *Spirit of Survival (1987) *Character: America's Search for Leadership (1991) *The Man Who Changed the World: The Lives of Mikhail S.

She was the wife of Aulus Plautius, the general who led the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD, and was renowned as one of the few people who dared to publicly mourn the death of a kinswoman killed by the Imperial family. It has been speculated that she was an early Christian. She is identified by some as Lucina or Lucy, a saint honoured by the Roman Catholic Church. ==Family background== Pomponia's background is not certain, but can be reconstructed as follows. Her father was probably Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, who was suffect consul in 16 AD and a correspondent of Ovid.William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, 1870, Vol 3 p. 492 Graecinus' wife was Asinia, sister of Gaius Asinius Pollio, and through her Pomponia was related to the Imperial family. Asinia's father, Gaius Asinius Gallus, was consul in 8 BC, and her mother Vipsania, was the daughter of the general and politician Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, 1870, Vol. 3 p. 438 By her former husband, the future emperor Tiberius, Vipsania was also the mother of Drusus the Younger. Vipsania's half-siblings, from her father's marriage to Augustus' daughter Julia, included Agrippina the Elder, mother of the emperor Caligula and Agrippina the Younger, who was the mother of Nero and wife of Claudius. Other notable ancestors on her mother's side include the historian and senator Gaius Asinius Pollio, who was consul in 40 BC. ==Biography== Pomponia married Aulus Plautius (d. by 65 AD), the senator and general who led the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD, for which he later received a military ovation, and who governed Roman Britain until 47 AD. A younger Aulus Plautius, probably their son, was murdered by the emperor Nero, supposedly because Nero's mother Agrippina had fallen in love with him and encouraged him to bid for the throne.Suetonius, Nero 35 In 43 AD Pomponia's relative Julia, daughter of her uncle Drusus Julius Caesar, was executed on the orders of her maternal uncle, the emperor Claudius at the instigation of the empress Valeria Messalina. Pomponia spent the next forty years in open mourning in defiance of successive emperors. She escaped punishment for this, possibly as a result of her own illustrious ancestry and her husband's sterling military reputation, which gave her prestige. According to Tacitus, Pomponia lived a long, unhappy life, possibly as a result of her son's murder and the deaths of several relatives associated with the Imperial family. In 57 AD Pomponia was charged with practicing a \\"foreign superstition\\", which has been taken by some to mean conversion to Christianity, although there were other regulated cults in ancient Rome. According to ancient Roman tradition, she was tried by her husband before her kinsmen, and acquitted.Tacitus, Annals 13.32 She died in 83 AD.Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, vol. 1 Inscriptions in the catacombs of Saint Callistus in Rome suggest that later members of Pomponia‚Äôs family were indeed Christians. The archaeologist Battista de Rossi controversially identifies her with Saint Lucina, the purported donor of the part of the catacombs where the inscriptions were found, and suggests that Lucina was Pomponia's baptismal name. Saint Lucina is honored by the Roman Catholic Church on 30 June.St. Lucina - Catholic Online She is said to have visited the martyrs Martinian and Processus, the two former guards at the Mamertine Prison who had been converted in the prison by their prisoner Saint Peter, and buried their bodies after their execution.St. Luke Orthodox Church - Saints, April 11th ==Fictional depictions== Pomponia Graecina and her husband Aulus Plautius are informal adoptive parents of Ligia, the heroine of Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1895 historical novel Quo Vadis. The novel presents both Pomponia and her adoptive daughter as secret Christians, something that Plautius either does not know or chooses to ignore. In the 1951 film adaptation she was played by Nora Swinburne. Pomponia is portrayed in When the Eagle Hunts, a novel of historical fiction from the Eagle Series by Simon Scarrow. In the story, Pomponia and her two children are captured and held hostage by Druids resisting the Roman invasion of Britain, while a rescue is attempted by the series' two main characters. Giovanni Pascoli's poem Pomponia GraecinaLatin text won him the gold medal at the Certamen Hoeufftianum in 1910. She also makes an appearance in David Wishart's Family Commitments, part of the Marcus Corvinus series. ==References== Graecina Category:Julio-Claudian dynasty Category:1st-century Roman women Category:1st-century Christians Category:83 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People acquitted of crimes ","title":"Pomponia Graecina"},{"id":"3256896","text":"Jonathan Child (January 30, 1785 ‚Äì October 27, 1860) was an American businessman and politician. He was the first Mayor of Rochester, New York and son-in-law of Colonel Nathaniel Rochester. ==Early life== Child was born in New Hampshire, and in 1805, at the age of 20, he moved to Utica, New York. In 1810, he moved to Charlotte, New York, and then during the War of 1812, he moved to Bloomfield, New York, and opened up a store in part of a local tavern. While in Bloomfield, he met Sophia, the oldest daughter of Colonel Rochester. ==Career== In 1816, Child was a representative to the New York State Assembly in Albany. In 1820, he moved to Rochester and opened a store at the Four Corners there. When the Erie Canal was completed, he operated a fleet of canal boats on those waters. He later helped organize and build the Tonawanda Railroad, the first in Rochester. In 1824, he became a trustee of the First Bank of Rochester, and in 1827, became a village trustee. In June 1834, the Whig majority of the first Rochester city council, selected Child to be the first mayor ‚Äì Rochester mayors were not elected by popular vote until 1840. He resigned the next spring after newly elected Democrats in the city council authorized granting liquor licenses in Rochester. After his resignation, Child built a mansion of Washington Street in Rochester, and using some of his canal boats, became an early importer of coal. ==Death and legacy== After his wife Sophia died in 1850, Child moved to Buffalo, New York, where he died ten years later on October 27, 1860. His Rochester home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 as part of the Jonathan Child House & Brewster-Burke House Historic District. ==References== ==External links== * *Blake McKelvey Rochester Mayors Before the Civil War, 1964 Category:1785 births Category:1860 deaths Category:Burials at Mount Hope Cemetery (Rochester) Category:People from Charlotte, New York Category:Members of the New York State Assembly Category:Mayors of Rochester, New York Category:New York (state) Whigs Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Politicians from Utica, New York Category:Businesspeople from Utica, New York Category:People from Lyme, New Hampshire ","title":"Jonathan Child"},{"id":"3256905","text":"TV 2 Film was a 24-hour two-star movie channel owned by TV 2. It was launched on November 1, 2005, at 9 p.m. First to air was the Danish feature film The Green Butchers. The channel mostly shows American two-star movies. Each movie is shown many times over the course of several days. In August 2008, the channel started broadcasting in the widescreen format. This was followed by the launch of a high-definition simulcast of the channel on January 1, 2009. The channel was developed from a film strand on TV 2 called \\"en go' film uden afbrydelser\\" (\\"A good movie without interruptions\\"). Initially, the channel carried advertising between the films, but this practise was discontinued in 2007 as the advertising sales had remained modest. On satellite, TV 2 Film (as well as TV 2 Charlie and TV 2 Film) was initially exclusively available via Canal Digital. The competing Viasat platform started broadcasting the channels in January 2009. Since 1 November 2009, the channel also became available terrestrially (via Viaccess-technology by Boxer-approved digital boxes and cards), the same date as Denmark closed down all analogue terrestrial broadcasting and started up DVB-T and MPEG2/MPEG4 digital terrestrial broadcasting. Since then, DVB-T2 has been introduced for HD and TV2 Film is now terrestrially broadcast both as HD (through DVB-T2 & MPEG4) and SD (through DVB-T and MPEG4). In January 2012, the channel was dropped by Denmark's leading cable provider YouSee after they failed to agree on pricing and conditions. The penetration dropped further in January 2013, when Viasat dropped TV 2 Film. After that, the channel would only be available via Canal Digital, Boxer, Stofa and smaller IPTV and cable providers. In August 2014, TV 2 announced that TV 2 Film was to be closed down and replaced by a then unnamed sports channel in early 2015. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Defunct television channels in Denmark Category:Television channels and stations established in 2005 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2015 Category:2005 establishments in Denmark Category:2015 disestablishments in Denmark ","title":"TV 2 Film"},{"id":"3256911","text":"Stonycreek can refer to: *Stonycreek Township, Cambria County, Pennsylvania *Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania *Stonycreek River, in Pennsylvania ==See also== *Stony Creek (disambiguation) *Stoney Creek (disambiguation) *Steinbach (disambiguation) ","title":"Stonycreek"},{"id":"3256912","text":"\\"Beautiful Nebraska\\" is the regional anthem of the U.S. state of Nebraska.

It is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction. Nereid Avenue is the northern terminal for all peak-direction rush-hour 5 trains that use this branch. However, all 2 trains terminate at the next stop, Wakefield‚Äì241st Street. ==History== This station was built under the Dual Contracts. On March 3, 1917, IRT White Plains Road Line was extended from East 177th Street‚ÄìEast Tremont Avenue to East 219th Street‚ÄìWhite Plains Road, providing the Bronx communities of Williamsbridge and Wakefield with access to rapid transit service. Service was initially operated as a four-car shuttle from 177th Street due to the power conditions at the time. An extension to 238rd Street, including the and stations, finally opened on March 31, 1917. On December 13, 1920, the final portion of the line opened, extending the line from its previous terminal at 238th Street to the line's permanent terminus at 241st Street. This portion of the line had its opening delayed, owing to construction on the line between the two stations for the construction of the 239th Street Yard to the north of 238th Street. Additional time was required to modify the structure to avoid a grade crossing at the entrance to the yard. The station was renovated in 2007 at a cost of $14.46 million. ==Station layout== This station has three tracks and two side platforms. At the north end of the station, the northbound track ascends to pass over yard leads, while the others descend.

The Golden Gate Biosphere is a biosphere reserve in Northern California. It was created by UNESCO in 1988 and encompasses 13 protected areas in the San Francisco Bay Area. It extends through the central California coastal region from the Bodega Marine Reserve in the north to Jasper Ridge in the south and includes the Farallon Islands, Angel Island, and Alcatraz within the San Francisco Bay. The biosphere reserve is situated on both sides of the San Andreas Fault. Each side has a completely different type of bedrock, and the western side of the rift is moving northward. It encompasses a diverse range of marine, coastal, and upland habitats of the California chaparral and woodlands and Northern California coastal forests ecoregions, including mixed evergreen forests, Coast Redwood forests, Douglas-fir forests, Bishop pine forests, oak forests, woodlands and savannas, northern coastal scrub, chaparral, coastal dune, coastal strand, tidepools, kelp forests, coastal grasslands, and marshes. The associated fauna is also rich with cougars, Tule elk, California sea lions, elephant seals, and many shorebirds. The conservation units that make up the biosphere reserve include: * Audubon Canyon Ranch * Bodega Marine Reserve * Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary * Golden Gate National Recreation Area * Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary * Farallon National Wildlife Refuge * Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve * Marin Municipal Water District * Mount Tamalpais State Park * Point Reyes National Seashore * San Francisco Peninsula Watershed (San Francisco Public Utilities Commission) * Tomales Bay State Park * Samuel P. Taylor State Park The Golden Gate Biosphere is unique in that its marine, coastal, and upland resources are adjacent to a major metropolitan area and thus provide easy access to outdoor education and recreation for the inhabitants of the San Francisco Bay metropolitan area. The area supports many recreational activities such as sport fisheries, hiking, bicycling, and whale watching. The biosphere reserve is organized under an association with three councils, which are responsible for management, science, and education projects. For instance, members cooperate on tidal pool monitoring and public education in the area of Mount Tamalpais State Park. Another joint activity is the Coho salmon restoration project, which requires habitat inventorying and mapping of several critical watersheds. The biosphere reserve also cooperates with the Iroise Biosphere Reserve of France in a comparison of coastal ecosystem recovery after human use changes. Research covers topics such as the management of commercially important resources such as fisheries, threats to ecosystems such as oil spills, pollutants, and invasive species, and episodic events such as wildfires and climate extremes. == Sources == ==External links== * UNESCO.org: Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve == References == Category:Natural history of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Biosphere reserves of the United States Category:Nature reserves in California Category:Parks in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:San Francisco Bay Category:Environment of the San Francisco Bay Area ","title":"Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve"},{"id":"3256945","text":"Katherine Albrecht is a consumer privacy advocate and spokesperson against radio-frequency identification (RFID).

It is part of the Southern African Sunshine Tour and is one of four events in South Africa that are co-sanctioned by the more prestigious European Tour. The tournament was founded in 2000, but its origins lie in Dunhill's sponsorship of the South African PGA Championship between 1995 and 1999. Following the 1999 Alfred Dunhill PGA Championship, the company decided to discontinue their association with the South African PGA, and create their own stand alone tournament. The first event was held in January 2000 at the Houghton Golf Club in Johannesburg, and replaced the South African PGA Championship on the European Tour calendar. In 2004, the tournament was rescheduled to December, resulting in two events being staged that year. Following this change, the Alfred Dunhill Championship has formed part of the following year's European Tour season. In addition, the event was moved to the Leopard Creek Country Club, just south of the Kruger National Park in Malalane, Mpumalanga. The Dunhill Championship should not be confused with the Dunhill Links Championship, a much richer European Tour event with the same sponsor which is played in Scotland. In 2016, the Alfred Dunhill Championship replaced the South African Open as the tour's flagship event by the Official World Golf Ranking governing board. The winner was awarded 32 OWGR points. ==Winners== {class= style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !rowspan=2Year!!colspan=2Season!!rowspan=2Winner!!rowspan=2Country!!rowspan=2Score!!rowspan=2To par!!rowspan=2Margin of victory!!rowspan=2Runner(s)-up - !

The water tower of the pumphouse is one of the few structure remaining from the 1800s. Now, it provides restrooms within for visitors and cyclists traveling on the Great Allegheny Passage trail. Homestead Steel Works was a large steel works located on the Monongahela River at Homestead, Pennsylvania in the United States. The company developed in the nineteenth century as an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a railway long, and a line of lake steamships. The works was the site of one of the more serious labor disputes in U.S. history, which became known as the Homestead strike of 1892. ==History== The steel works were first constructed in 1881. Andrew Carnegie, (a Scottish emigrant), bought the 2 year old Homestead Steel Works in 1883, and integrated it into his Carnegie Steel Company.. For many years, the Homestead Works was the largest steel mill in the world and the most productive of the Mon Valley's many mills. A series of industrial disputes over wages, working hours and contracts occurred in the early years of the works, leading to the Homestead strike, an industrial lockout and strike which began on June 30, 1892, culminating in a battle between strikers and private security agents on July 6, 1892. The battle was one of the most violent disputes in U.S. labor history and the final result was a major defeat for the union and a setback for their efforts to unionize steelworkers. In 1896, Carnegie built the Carnegie Library of Homestead in nearby Munhall as part of concessions to the striking workers. (This however has never been validated. Carnegie had the plans drawn up in the late 1880s, and run ins with the Union bosses kept him from actually building it.) Barge and The Waterfront shopping center In 1901, Carnegie sold his operations to U.S. Steel. On January 6, 1906 it was announced that the company would undergo upgrades and expansions worth seven million dollars ($ today.) The workforce peaked at 15,000 during World War II.Article about the Homestead Works on the 20th anniversary of its closing (includes audio), Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (post-gazette.com) William J. Gaughan was a Senior Designer of Operations Planning and Control at the company who developed computer systems to aid in automation of various operations. Throughout his management career, Gaughan had developed an interest in the history of Homestead Steel Works and began to collect photos and pamphlets regarding the company. The plant closed in 1986 because of a severe downturn in the domestic steel industry, from which the industry still hasn't recovered.Carrie Furnace, a blast furnace across the Monongahela River from the main siteA few remnants of the steel works were not destroyed, including twelve smokestacks in the middle of the Waterfront development.Battle of Homestead Foundation As of its opening in 1999, the land is home to The Waterfront, an outdoor shopping center.

Instead of giving him up for adoption as planned, she chose to keep the baby. Her mother, Terry (Mercedes Ruehl) pretends the infant is hers to allow Jacey to finish high school and lead a relatively normal life and graduate. When Jacey attends a new school, she criticizes several of the students for their promiscuous behavior during a class discussion. Jacey's opinions lead Donna Cooper (Jane Krakowski), the Health teacher, to take a special interest in Jacey. Jacey's comments are unique in that she does not have an interest in following what her classmates say. The teacher's husband, the swim coach Bob (Colin Ferguson), convinces Jacey to join the swim team. Jacey passes out after taking tranquilizers stolen from her mother and ends up in the hospital. Donna and Bob are unable to conceive and are devastated when they discover their latest round of In-Vitro Fertilization has failed. Jacey feels that matters are unresolved with Charlie's father, Brad. It is apparent that Jacey was and still is in love with him. Jacey feels guilty because Brad is unaware that Jacey gave birth. Brad currently attends college. When Jacey attempts to call him, she becomes nervous upon hearing his voice and hangs up. Donna sees Jacey with Charlie, and asks if Jacey is his mother. Although Jacey lied, many students from the school witnessed the interrogation and believe Jacey is really the mother. She begins to get teased at school for her behavior. Her secret is found out at school, when the students were asked about how guys react to what girls wear. When other students criticize her for her hypocrisy, she goes to a mothers meeting for teen mothers. After being teased at school, she leaves abruptly to see Brad. They spend the day together, and are about to have sex, when Jacey announces that the reason she left him was because she got pregnant. Brad takes the news badly and leaves. Jacey returns home and has a huge argument with Terry who hands her Charlie and tells her to handle things on her own, angry that Jacey doesn't understand the sacrifices she has made to help Jacey have a normal life. Exhausted and confused, she turns to Donna for help and advice. Donna advocates for Jacey telling her mother that she wants to be Charlie's mom to which Terry gives a speech about the sacrifices it takes to be a 'real Mom'. A few weeks later, Brad arrives at Jacey's house to apologize and tells Terry that he will make it work between Jacey and him. However, when Jacey makes a surprise visit to his school, she finds out Brad's parents will only help if a DNA test is done to prove Brad is the father; Jacey feels betrayed and leaves him. At school, Jacey gives a speech on pregnancy and teen sex, using examples from her friends from the teen mother's meeting. She gets applause and respect from her former bullies for being honest and sensible. Afterwards, Macy, her sister, gives her a DVD she had put together for Charlie for him to watch when he is older. Watching it together with Terry, the two reconcile. Later, Donna receives a call that there is a baby waiting to be adopted. Overjoyed, Donna and Bob go to adopt the child, only to find that it is Terry and Jacey who have decided to give him up to give him his best chance. She apparently remains a part of Charlie's life, as five years later she's there at Charlie's first day at kindergarten, Donna and Bob have a new baby daughter, and Bob is shown recording Charlie and asks Charlie to talk about himself. \\"I'm Charlie Cooper and I'm 5 years old, I got a new baby sister.\\" Charlie tells the camera that he has two mommies and that Jacey is his special mommy and Bob asks why. Charlie replies, \\"because I'm the only one who knows how her heart feels from inside her.\\" It is indicated in one scene that this is in fact the couple that was originally going to adopt him before Jacey changed her mind. ==Cast== * Danielle Panabaker as Jacey Jeffries * Jane Krakowski as Donna Cooper * Clare Stone as Macy Jeffries * Tyler Hynes as Brad * Colin Ferguson as Bob Cooper * Mercedes Ruehl as Terry Jeffries * Hollis McLaren as Marlene * Rejean Cournoyer as Mr. Cheevers * Dawn McKelvie Cyr as Gretchen * Megan Edwards as Linda * Matthew MacCaull as Dr. Hughes * Sabrina Jalees as Sarah * Deborah Allen as Pauline * Anastasia Hill as Trea * Leah Fassett as Gena * Scott Smith as Charlie ==External links== * Category:2005 television films Category:2005 films Category:2000s teen drama films Category:American teen drama films Category:American films Category:Lifetime (TV network) films Category:Teenage pregnancy in film Category:Teenage pregnancy in television Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films about adoption ","title":"Mom at Sixteen"},{"id":"3257013","text":"Grandborough is a small village and civil parish in Warwickshire, England. The parish includes the hamlets of Calcutt, Grandborough Fields and Woolscott. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 424. Grandborough is in a rural area of eastern Warwickshire, around six miles (10 km) south of Rugby and six miles northwest of Daventry, Northamptonshire. The village is part of the borough of Rugby. Grandborough is about two miles from the nearest main roads and can be reached by country lanes from the A45 to the east, and the A426 to the west. The River Leam flows north of the village. There was a watermill (now a private residence) where the river passed under the road from Woolscott. In times of flood, the river flows over the road creating a ford. A road sign suggests that pedestrians and motorists should \\"Use causeway if flooded\\". Grandborough's church is dedicated to St Peter. The church spire, and the two tall Wellingtonia trees which flank it, are notable local landmarks. There is also a Primitive Methodist chapel (erected in 1856 and extended in 1991), a village hall (the Benn Memorial Hall, erected in 1897) and a number of old (mostly Victorian) cottages. The village has a pub called the Shoulder of Mutton. In Main Street there is a private house which was formerly a pub called the Royal George.

On April 12, 2006 an Ottawa Dispersal Draft was held where the remaining 8 teams chose players from the Ottawa Renegades' roster. On September 28, it was confirmed that Ottawa would return no sooner than the 2008 season, to give potential new owners enough time to set up the new franchise. Ultimately, the Renegades never returned. They would not be replaced until the formation of the Ottawa Redblacks, who began play for the 2014 CFL season. The 2006 season is the first season where teams will be able to challenge officials' calls using instant replay. The CFL's replay system seems to be largely modelled on the one used in the NFL although there are some differences. A new salary cap and salary management system (SMS) was adopted for the 2006 season, although the enforcement part of the new system will not take effect until the 2007 season. The cap for the 2007 season has been set at $4.05 million. It was announced on July 5, 2006 that Tom Wright, commissioner of the CFL, had informed the CFL that he would not be seeking a contract extension as league commissioner after this season, thus ending his tenure as the 11th CFL commissioner. Prior to his final day in the office, Wright presented the Grey Cup to the BC Lions as they defeated the Montreal Alouettes in the championship game at Winnipeg's Canad Inns Stadium. Commissioner Wright and TSN President Phil King announced a landmark five-year multi-platform agreement between the League and TSN to commence in 2008 on December 20. On October 26, 2006 Hugh Campbell stepped down as CEO of the Eskimos. The number of TDs scored on kicking or punting plays dropped dramatically in 2006, which many attributed to stricter rules on blocking. There were 16 such TDs in 2005, and just 3 in the 2006 season. ===Records and Milestones=== Damon Allen became pro-football's all-time passing yardage leader on September 4 by surpassing Warren Moon's total of 70,553 yards (in both the CFL and NFL combined) as the Toronto Argonauts defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 40‚Äì6. Terry Vaughn became the all-time receptions leader, surpassing Darren Flutie with 973 on July 14. Then on September 22, Vaughn became the first football receiver in CFL history to record 1,000 all-time receptions. On October 14, Byron Parker sets a new CFL single-season record for most interception return yardage with 342 on a 75-yard interception return for a touchdown in Edmonton. On October 20, Mike O'Shea becomes the first Canadian and third player (behind Willie Pless and Alondra Johnson) to have had 1,000 career tackles. The Edmonton Eskimos' streak of 34 straight years in the playoffs came to an end in 2006. ==Regular season== Note: GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PF = Points For, PA = Points Against, Pts = Points Teams in bold' finished in playoff positions. ===Notes=== * Ottawa Renegades have suspended operations for the 2006 season. ==Grey Cup playoffs== The BC Lions are the 2006 Grey Cup Champions, defeating the Montreal Alouettes 25‚Äì14 at Winnipeg's Canad Inns Stadium.

First published as the Evening Capital on May 12, 1884, the newspaper switched to mornings on March 9, 2015. The company has moved headquarters seven times, including from 3 Church Circle to 213 West Street in 1948, to 2000 Capital Drive in 1987, to Gibralter Road after that, and to 888 Bestgate Road in 2014. The Capital was acquired by The Baltimore Sun Media Group in 2014. ==History== The newspaper was founded in 1884 as the Evening Capital and operated under this name until June 20, 1981, when it was shortened to just The Capital. Its founder was William M. Abbott, a former compositor for The Baltimore Sun, who employed his daughter Emma Abbott Gage as the newspaper's editor and his son Charles B. Abbott as business manager. In 1910, Abbott purchased the weekly Maryland Gazette from Col. Phillip E. Porter and merged the paper with his Capital, creating the Evening Capital and Maryland Gazette. In the years following the Civil War, Annapolis faded economically, and the pages of the Evening Capital mostly reflected the local happenings of a sleepy, provincial town. During the early twentieth century, the expansion of the nearby United States Naval Academy was recorded in the paper as a source of both optimism and concern for local citizens. Abbott and his family handed over ownership of the paper to Ridgely P. Melvin in 1919, and it reverted to its original name of Evening Capital in 1922. Melvin subsequently sold the Capital to the Capital-Gazette Press Company in 1926. For much of the twentieth century, the Capital was edited by Elmer Jackson, Jr., who had been appointed in 1931. In 1959, it added a Saturday morning edition. In 1967, the newspaper and its sisters were sold to Philip Merrill and Landmark Communications, who shared ownership. Jackson was replaced as editor. Under this ownership, which lasted until 2007, the Capital saw great success, with its circulation nearly tripling. After Merrill's death in 2006, Landmark obtained full ownership of the paper; it kept this ownership until 2014, when the Capital and its related holdings were sold to the Baltimore Sun Media Group, a tronc company. Its change to a seven-day-a-week morning paper was announced on February 8, 2015, and implemented on March 9. As of 2018, The Capital had a daily circulation of about 33,000. The papers are printed on a computerized high-speed Goss International Headliner press. ==Shooting== On June 28, 2018, a man killed five employees at the Capital Gazette offices in Annapolis, Maryland: journalists Rob Hiaasen, Wendi Winters, Gerald Fischman, and John McNamara, and sales assistant Rebecca Smith. The staff of The Capital and its parent company were subsequently chosen by Time as Person of the Year 2018, as one of \\"The Guardians,\\" a collection of journalists from around the world in their fight against the \\"War on Truth.\\" On April 15, 2019, The Capital received a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation to \\"...honor the journalists, staff and editorial board of the Capital Gazette, Annapolis, Maryland, for their courageous response to the largest killing of journalists in U.S. history in their newsroom on June 28, 2018, and for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief.\\" ==References== ==External links== *HometownAnnapolis.com *Maryland Archives.

He was a younger son of Wossen Seged. Sahle Selassie was the father of numerous sons, among them Haile Melekot, Haile Mikael, Seyfe Sahle Selassie, Amarkegne and Darge Sahle Selassie ; his daughters included Tenagnework, Ayahilush, Wossenyelesh, Birkinesh, and Tinfelesh. == His life == When their father had been murdered, Oromo rebels in Marra Biete kept Sahle Selassie's older brother Bakure from promptly marching to their father's capital at Qundi to claim the succession. Although still a teenager, Sahle Selassie seized this chance at rule by rushing from the monastery at Sela Dingay where he was a student \\"and probably with the support of his mother Zenebework's Menzian kinsmen was proclaimed the Ras and Meridazmach of Shewa.\\" Bakure belatedly arrived at Qundi only to be imprisoned in the state prison at Gonchu with his other brothers and some of his supporters. Once securely in control, Sahle Selassie turned his attention to the rebels, both Amhara and Oromo. He used diplomacy to win over the Abichu Oromo, who badly needed his help against their neighbors the Tulama Oromo, whom he defeated in the early 1820s. He followed this victory by rebuilding Debre Berhan, which had been burned in an Oromo raid, as well as a number of other towns and consolidated his hold by founding a number of fortified villages, like Angolalla, in the Abichu territory. He extended the frontier of Shewa into Bulga and Karayu, to the southeast into Arsi, and as far south as the territories of the Gurage.Abir, p. 153. On the other hand, he continued the policy of his ancestor Amha Iyasus in maintaining a buffer region to his north, created from the Yejju and Wollo Oromo rulers in the area. This helped keep Shewa out of the reach of the northern lords like Ras Ali II of Yejju, who continued their own civil wars. The banquet hall in King Sahle Selassie palace After a few years, Sahle Selassie felt his position secure enough that he proclaimed himself Negus, or king, of Shewa, Yifat, the Oromo and the Gurage peoples, without the authority of the Emperor of Ethiopia in Gondar, but with his apparent acquiescence. However, in 1829 Shewa suffered a famine, then for two years, starting in 1830, was stricken by a cholera epidemic, where two thirds of the sick at Sahle Selassie's palace died. Then one of Sahle Selassie's generals, Medoko, rebelled and convinced a number of the elite Shewan matchlockmen to desert with him to join the Oromos. Together these adversaries threatened the existence of Shewa, and burned Angolalla. About the time Sahle Selassie put down this rebellion in 1834 or 1835, a drought afflicted Shewa for two years, killing most of the domestic animals and bringing famine to his people. Pankhurst also documents records of a second cholera epidemic in 1834, which spread south from Welo causing a great mortality.Richard P.K. Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia, 1800‚Äì1935 (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), pp. 217, 625. Sahle Selassie responded to the famine by opening the royal storehouses to the needy, endearing himself to his people. The famine came to an end in time for Medoko to rise again in rebellion, and although the general was quickly crushed, Sahle Selassie was then confronted by a crisis in the local church.The outline of this narrative is based on Abir, pp. 156f. During the ongoing dispute over Christology that had split the Ethiopian Church into a number of hostile factions, Shewa had embraced the doctrine of the Sost Lidet in opposition to the theory of Wold Qib, which was embraced in the north. The Sost Lidet was also embraced by the influential monastery of Debre Libanos, located in Shewa. When Sahle Selassie sought to strengthen his power over the Shewan church by appointing men loyal to himself as trusties of the local monasteries‚Äîan act that brought the opposition not only of the monks themselves, but also of the Ichege, the abbot of the monastery of Debre Libanos and the second most powerful churchman in Ethiopia. Facing the threat of excommunication, Sahle Selassie relented and on 24 November 1841 dismissed his appointees‚Äîonly to find himself under attack by Shewan supporters of the Wold Qib in Menz, Marra Biete, and other districts. At the moment the monarch managed to quiet this controversy, the arrival of a new Abuna, Salama III reawoke the resistance of the followers of the Wold Qib, and the new Abuna excommunicated Sahle Selassie in 1845. Despite the intervention of Imperial Regent, Ras Ali II, Abuna Salama refused to lift the interdict, and Ras Ali finally arrested the Abuna in 1846 and banished him from Gondar.Abir, pp. 158f. By this time, Sahle Selassie's health had begun to fail, and he was unable to pursue his intentions on the Imperial throne. Only the intervention of his close friends and advisers kept the Negus from abdicating the throne in favor of his son, and the final years of his reign are otherwise unremarkable.Abir, pp. 176f. == Achievements as ruler of Shewa == King Sahle Selassie sitting in judgment Despite his many reverses against his political rivals inside Shewa and out, considered against any other period of history, Negus Sahle Selassie was a progressive and benevolent ruler. A contemporary British visitor, Charles Johnston, commented that the : contemplation of such a prince in his own land is worth the trouble and the risk of visiting it ... his character for justice and probity has spread far and wide, and the supremacy of political excellence is without hesitation given to the Negoos [Negus] of Shoa throughout the length and breadth of the ancient empire of Ethiopia. To be feared by every prince around, and loved by every subject at home, is the boast of the first government of civilized Europe, and strangely enough this excellence of social condition is paralleled in the heart of Africa, where we find practically carried out the most advantageous policy of a social community that one of the wisest of sages could conceive ‚Äì that of arbitrary power placed in the hands of a really good man.Quoted in Pankhurst, pp. 2f. Abir provides several examples of Sahle Selassie's interest in the well-being of his subjects: : In time of famine he opened the royal granaries to the population. When a plague carried off most of the work-animals of the farmers, he distributed oxen and mules. He kept enormous stores of salt so that his people would not lack this important commodity should the roads to the coast be cut.Abir, p. 160. Further examples of Sahle Selassie's skill in administration is his reform of the laws of his domain. Courts during the reign of his predecessors Asfa Wossen and Wossen Seged followed both the Fetha Negest, the traditional Ethiopian legal code, as well as customary practices, which Abir states \\"was extremely cruel. Death sentences, severance of limbs and branding with hot iron were very common.\\"Abir, p. 170. The Negus limited executions to extreme cases of treason, sacrilege and murder, and even then required approval from the Negus. Whenever possible, Sahle Selassie reduced a death sentence to life imprisonment or forfeiture of property; in the case of a murder conviction, where the traditional Ethiopian penalty was to hand the murderer over to the relatives of the victim, who would then exact their own punishment, the Negus worked to convince the relatives to accept blood money instead of killing the convicted man. His reforms extended beyond criminal law and included administrative reforms. He developed a new structure of taxation that was not only fairer to his subjects, but brought in a more substantial and reliable revenue; it is estimated that around 1840 his revenue in cash alone was between 80,000 and 300,000 Maria Theresa Thalers. Legends circulated in Shewa about the storehouses of gold, silver, and ivory the Negus had not only in his palaces in Doqaqit, Har Ambit and Ankober, but also hidden in mountain caves.Abir, p. 173. \\"All in all,\\" concludes Abir, \\"Showa can be considered, in a way, an archaic example of a welfare state.\\"Abir, p. 161. Sahle Selassie also worked to modernize his country, and like his contemporaries Goshu of Gojjam and Wube Haile Maryam of Tigray, he made contacts with European countries like France and Great Britain in hope of gaining craftsmen, educators, and above all firearms. Like his contemporaries, he understood the value of firearms, and increased the number in his armories from a few score when he took office to 500 in 1840, and doubled that number again by 1842.Abir, p. 176. He signed treaties of friendship with both France (16 November 1841) and Great Britain (7 June 1841).These two documents have been published with English translations in Sven Rubenson, Acta Aethiopica, Volume I: Correspondence and Treaties, 1800‚Äì1854 (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1987), letters 44 and 66. The Negus also encouraged foreigners to settle in Shewa, and offered considerable incentives to them, such as the revenue from a large village he granted a Greek mason by the name of Demetrios. As a result, at one point a number of foreigners were present in Shewa, who included a number of Greeks, at least one Armenian, and several traders from Eastern lands.Pankhurst, p. 52. \\"Despite his understanding of the value of foreign technology and the need for craftsmen from abroad Sahla Sellase had no desire for foreign missionaries,\\" Pankhurst notes,Pankhurst, p. 5. and although the arrival of two Protestant missionaries in 1837 led to a diplomatic mission from Britain by William Cornwallis Harris, both men were gently but firmly expelled in 1842. == Notes == Category:Rulers of Shewa Category:19th-century Ethiopian people Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1795 births Category:1847 deaths ","title":"Sahle Selassie"},{"id":"3257062","text":"Crombie may refer to: *Alexander Crombie (1762‚Äì1840), British educator, philosopher and Presbyterian minister *Alistair Cameron Crombie (1915‚Äì1996), Australian historian *Bonnie Crombie (born 1960), Canadian politician and current Mayor of Mississauga, Ontario *David Crombie (born 1936), Canadian politician *Blake Crombie, fictional character from New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street *Ed Crombie (born 1945), Canadian racecar driver *Jamie Crombie (born 1965), American-Canadian squash player *John Crombie, founder of the Crombie Mills clothing brand *Jonathan Crombie (1966-2015), Canadian actor *Noel Crombie (born 1953), musician (member of Split Enz) *Tony Crombie (1925‚Äì1999), English jazz drummer and bandleader *Tony Crombie, Commissioner of the British Antarctic Territory since 2004 *Thomas Crombie Schelling (1921‚Äì2016), American economist Other things named Crombie *Crombie (clothing), trade name for clothing made by the J&J; Crombie company *Crombie Settlement, New Brunswick, a Canadian rural community in Victoria County, New Brunswick *Crombie, Fife, village on the Firth of Forth, Scotland *Crombie REIT, Canadian property management company *DM Crombie, a military munitions storage depot on the Firth of Forth, Scotland ","title":"Crombie"},{"id":"3257078","text":"Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli (19 February 1900 ‚Äì 17 January 1975) was an Italian archaeologist and art historian.Francesca Ridgway (1996) \\"Bianchi Bandinelli, Ranuccio\\" in Encyclopedia of the History of Classical Archaeology. Nancy Thomson de Grummond (ed.). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, vol. 1, p. 144 (note on Belvedere Apollo) and 158. ==Biography== Bianchi Bandinelli was born in Siena to Mario Bianchi Bandinelli (1859‚Äì1930) and Margherita Ottilie \\"Lily\\" von Korn (Bianchi Bandinelli, 1878‚Äì1905), who were descended from ancient aristocracy in Siena. His early research focused on the Etruscan centers close to his family lands, Clusium (1925) and Suana (1929). Disgusted with Italian fascism, despite being the man who showed Hitler around Rome under Mussolini, he converted to communism after World War II and became a Marxist. As an anti- fascist, he was appointed to a number of important art-historical positions immediately after the war. For example, he was director of the new government's fine arts and antiquities ministry (Antichit√† e Belle Arti, 1945‚Äì48). His memoir of fascism in Italy was published in 1995 (Hitler e Mussolini, 1938: il viaggio del F√ºhrer in Italia). == Career == Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli receiving a foreign member diploma from the Soviet Academy of Sciences at the Soviet Embassy in Rome, October 1959 From his chairs at the universities of Florence and Rome, Bianchi Bandinelli directed a new breed of Italian archaeologists sensitive to classical history based upon dialectical materialism. He also taught at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. In the 1950s and 1960s he undertook the writing of comprehensive texts on classical art intended to reach a wide and literate audience. He founded the Enciclopedia dell'arte antica in 1958, and in the same year was elected as a foreign member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.–ë—å—è–Ω–∫–∏-–ë–∞–Ω–¥–∏–Ω–µ–ª–ª–∏ –†–∞–Ω—É—á—á–æ. ras.ru In the mid 1960s, Bianchi Bandinelli was commissioned to write the two volumes on Roman art for the French Arts of Mankind series. These works brought his writing to a larger audience and helped usher in social criteria for art into a larger and English-speaking audience. In 1967 he founded the Dialoghi di archeologia with his students, one of the most innovative, if controversial, periodicals on classical archaeology. He was frequently a maverick in his interpretation of art and his arguments were, if not always compelling, forcefully grounded. One such case is his interpretation of the famous Belvedere Apollo, a Roman copy of a Greek work now thought to date to the fourth century B.C. Although hailed by most art historians as a copy of the original work by the Greek master Leochares, Bianchi Bandinelli characterized the piece as a frigid copy of a Hellenistic work without relation to Leochares.

It resulted in an overwhelming victory for Nader and the Safavid cause he had taken up, though by itself it did not end Ashraf's rule in Persia, it was a significant triumph which led to further successes in the following engagements of the campaign to restore Tahmasp II to the throne. The battle was followed by another one in Murcheh-Khort, a village near Isfahan. Nader's forces were victorious in both battles, which led him to remove the Ghilzai Afghan dynasty from their short stay on the Persian throne. The Hotakis were forced back to their territory in what is now southern Afghanistan. The battle of Damghan proved the supremacy of Nader's artillery-dependent military system in comparison to the old exclusively cavalry based system utilised by the Afghans. Although Ashraf sought to remedy this in the subsequent engagement at Murcheh-Khort - relying on guns and artillery-men from the Ottomans - he failed to construct an adequate military structure to hold up against Nader's army. == Background == Ashraf having come to power in the aftermath of a coup against his predecessor, Mahmud Hotaki, had achieved great success in the war with the Ottomans where with a much inferior force he overcame a superior Turkish army and agreed to a settlement which divided the west of the former Safavid Empire with his Ottoman adversary in the aftermath of which he secured Turkish support and acceptance as the legitimate ruler of Persia. Meanwhile, Nader & Tahmasp had been campaigning in the north-east building up a base from which to challenge Ashraf's claim on his newly acquired dominion. Hearing of the Nader's march on Herat, Ashraf set out from Isfahan in August 1729 with a host 30,000 strong, in the hope of conquering Khorasan while Nader was waging war on the Abdali Afghans further to the east. Unfortunately for Ashraf, Nader subjugated Herat and returned to Mashad before Ashraf could invade Khorasan. Upon hearing of Ashraf's approach Nader gathered his fighting men to set out via Sabzevar on September 12, 1729. By the time Ashraf reached and besieged Semnan his force had grown to 40,000 compared to Nader's estimated strength of 25,000. Leaving a token force behind to resume the siege of Semnan Ashraf marched east towards Shahroud sending a fraction of his command ahead to seek out and destroy Nader's artillery. The first clash of arms between the two side occurred in a small but savagely fought skirmish south-east of Shahroud in which 14 Afghans were made prisoners whom were taken to Nader for interrogation. Nader continued to press forward until dusk, whence he began to make camp east of an obscure village by the name of Mihmandoost. That night Tahmasp promised him his sister's hand in marriage if Nader gained victory in battle on the following day. == Battle == 1\\\\. Nader sends forth his rear guard to protect his deployment on the left, onto the Tal hills. Elements of the Afghan left come into contact with the Persian rear guard but both sides soon break off to rejoin their respective armies 2\\\\. Nader uses this time to place his artillery on high ground overlooking his line infantry 3\\\\. Ashraf orders an all-out charge but his army is shattered by Persian musketry & cannon fire at close range 4\\\\. Nader gathers an infantry body and makes a thrust right into the heart of the Afghan army dividing it in two and routing it off the field === Deployments & pre-engagement manoeuvres === In the morning of September 29, Ashraf drew up his army in the traditional fashion in three separate formations making up the centre, left and right as opposed to the Persian army which Nader had formed up in four divisions. Ashraf was so confident of victory that he set aside two to three thousand of his horsemen to hunt down and capture Tahmasp and Nader after his victory. A rearguard of a few thousand mounted troops covered Nader's ongoing deployment to the left, on the Tal hills. In a break with conventional deployment patterns in oriental armies of this period Nader placed his artillery pieces behind his line infantry, where from their elevated positions on the high ground they overlooked the compact formations of Persian JazƒÅyerchi (musketeers) at the base of the hills as well as the valley in front of them.Axworthy, Michael (2009). The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant, p. 131. I. B. Tauris The Afghan left which had come into contact with the Persian rearguard and instead of pursuing them fell back in line with the rest of Ashraf's army when the rearguard was withdrawn. Ashraf gave the order for an all out charge driving his cavalry army of 40,000 riders towards the Persians whom were now awaiting at the foot of the Tal hills. The terrifying horde of Afghan riders charged forward with incredible speed and impetus. === The Afghan charge is broken up === A harrowing roar of cannon fire echoed throughout the valley as the Persian guns atop the crest of the hills were submerged under a white cloud of billowing smoke causing \\"three or four hundred Afghan soldiers to be sliced through like cucumbers\\". As the flanks of the Afghan army came into range of the JazƒÅyerchi they were shot to pieces as the Persian officers withheld their infantry's first volley until they could make out their enemies faces from the crowd, (perhaps a distance of a few dozen metres). This particular measure which had been perfected over the course of many years and battles by Nader's veteran JazƒÅyerchi proved devastatingly effective. The momentum of the Afghan charge had been sapped with the rear ranks falling over and trampling the remains of their shattered comrades in a staggered advance giving way to a terrible confusion with dust and smoke all around, incessant volleys from Persian musketeers, cannonballs striking punching through the flesh of man and beast alike as the zamburaks having found Ashraf's men within their range brought their swivel guns to bear. In amidst this bloody chaos Ashraf's chief standard holder was struck by a cannonball and a few of his own horses also perished under the unrelenting bombardment of Persian artillery fire which also succeeded in all but laying waste to the Afghan artillery (mostly consisting of zamburaks that were notoriously vulnerable to conventional cannon fire due to being mounted on camels making them easy targets for greater calibre guns). === Nader's thrust through the centre === A Persian counter-attack materialised in the form of a grouping of JazƒÅyerchi pressing forward with sabres drawn into the centre of Ashraf's army where the remains of his artillery were positioned. In the ensuing melee that developed the JazƒÅyerchi (who were armed with swords as well as other weaponry for hand-to- hand fighting) succeeded in pushing through the nucleus of their opponents formation and therefore in effect bisecting Ashraf's army, obliging it to flee the field having been completely bloodied. A short pursuit of the enemy followed by a contingent of Afshars that Nader had held in reserve but only for a few kilometres and the bulk of the Persian army were not allowed to join in the short lived hunt as Nader suspected a possible ambush further ahead en route to Semnan. == Aftermath == Leaving behind 12,000 dead, Ashraf marched hastily westward in a frantic bid to make good his losses in time for a subsequent confrontation. He wagered on an ambush which he set up around Khwar pass. Meanwhile, Nader and Tahmasp fell out over what course of action to take in the aftermath of Mihmandoost, as Nader (possibly disingenuously) advocated a return to Mashad to re-consolidate, to Tahmasp's extreme chagrin. In fact Tahmasp was so disconcerted by Nader's foot dragging that he marched out of camp in protest, prompting Nader to send reconciliatory emissaries inviting the King to return to the army although Nader would leave him at Tehran before resuming the campaign any further. ==See also== * Military of the Afsharid dynasty of Persia * Battle of Gulnabad * Battle of Murche-Khort * Battle of Khwar Pass == References == Damghan Damghan Category:Conflicts in 1729 Category:History of Semnan Province Category:1729 in Afghanistan ","title":"Battle of Damghan (1729)"},{"id":"3257116","text":"The Mafia Channel is a strait in the Pwani Region, Tanzania, Africa. ==Geography== The Mafia Channel stretches in a roughly north/south direction between the Rufiji River estuary and Mafia Island.

The battle occurred in the vicinity of Soor, also known as Hajnice, in the modern day Czech Republic. The battle started with a failed Austrian surprise attack on the outnumbered Prussians. Despite initial setbacks the Prussian army managed to defeat the Austrians, due to an unexpected attack from a reserve regiment that refused to follow Frederick's orders. ==Background== Three months after the battle of Hohenfriedberg, Frederick laid the \\"Camp of Staudenz\\", initially planning to return to Berlin, in order to inspect the building work on his new palace of Sans Souci. Having stripped off many detachments during his march through Bohemia, Frederick's numbers had been reduced to 22,500 men. Prince Charles then discovered that Frederick had failed to occupy the Graner-Koppe, a hill north of Burkersdorf (St≈ô√≠te≈æ, Trutnov District, modern day Czech Republic) that dominated the landscape to the east and south. On 29 September, Charles attempted to flank the Prussian camp from the K√∂nigreich-Wald hills, and the following morning the Austrians took positions on the crucial Graner-Koppe hill. The 40,200-strong Austrian army intended to destroy the Prussians in a surprise attack. ==Battle== Prussian scouts soon detected the Austrian presence, and drummers and trumpeters sounded the general alarm as Prussians began preparing for battle. Austrian artillery proceeded to fire on the Prussian encampment, while the Prussian army marched into battle. Frederick ordered the cavalry to charge up the valley to the side of the hill in order to encircle the enemy. During the maneuver the cavalry came under artillery fire, suffering heavy casualties. Despite the initial setback the vanguard regiments of the Gens D‚ÄôArmes and General Buddenbrock's cuirassiers managed to surprise the Austrian cavalry forcing it to flee. Coming under musket fire the Prussian cavalry withdrew to the rear of the force. By the time of the cavalry retreat, Prussian grenadiers and the Anhalt infantry regiment began engaging the Austrian troops positioned on the hill. An Austrian counterattack, supported by artillery fire, dealt significant damage to the Prussian infantry causing it to fall back. The Prussians then launched a second assault consisting of Geist Grenadiers, Blanckensee, La Motte and other battle hardened regiments. The unwillingness of the Austrian artillery to risk firing at its own troops contributed to the fall of the summit. A number of Prussian regiments positioned south of Burkersdorf ignored orders to remain in the area and attempted to capture Burkersdorf. A bayonet charge led by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick seized an Austrian battery, and the surprise attack led to the collapse of the Austrian line. Despite the lack of an organised pursuit many Austrian infantrymen were captured by the Prussian cavalry regiments. A total of 856 Prussians were killed, while the injured or missing amounted to 3,055. Austrian and Saxon troops suffered 7,444 dead, injured or missing. ==Order of battle== ===Austrian ‚Äì Saxon Army Order of Battle=== Map of the Battle of Soor *Right Wing Cavalry Division: **Kohary Dragoon Regiment **Palffy Cuirassier Regiment **Bretlach Cuirassier Regiment **Liechtenstein Dragoon Regiment **Hohenembs Cuirassier Regiment **St. Ignon Cuirassier Regiment *Right Wing Infantry Division: **Hesse ‚Äì Kassel Infantry Regiment **Damnitz Infantry Regiment **Baden ‚Äì Baden Infantry Regiment **Kolowrat Infantry Regiment **J.

He was Minister of Economy under Jorge Rafael Videla's administration between 1976 and 1981, and shaped economic policy at the National Reorganization Process. The spirit of all the reforms implemented during his administration was the liberalization of the economy. Precisely, economic freedom, a principle that is occasionally criticized in Argentina depending of the time. ==Biography== Mart√≠nez de Hoz, scion of one Argentina's oldest cattle ranching families, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pursuing higher studies at the University of Cambridge, he returned and in 1955, following the coup against President Juan Domingo Per√≥n, he was appointed his province's Minister of the Economy of Buenos Aires Province. ==Minister of Economy with Guido== Though democracy returned to Argentina three years later, the armed forces continued to exercise vetting power over most policy and in 1963, Mart√≠nez de Hoz became one of a series of conservative Argentine Economy Ministers during Jose Maria Guido's brief presidency (an interlude marked by squabbles among the military brass and recession). ==Private career== Becoming an influential lobbyist for Acindar, one of Argentina's largest steel manufacturers, Mart√≠nez de Hoz became its CEO in 1968. Seven years later, after union labourers at Acindar's Villa Constituci√≥n plant elected a socialist shop steward, Mart√≠nez de Hoz retaliated by using his family's long-standing connections with the armed forces to have them brutally repressed. Supported by Metalworkers Union leader Lorenzo Miguel, security forces abducted the new shop steward, Alberto Piccinini, and about 300 others (most of whom were murdered).Significativa propuesta realizada a Acindar ==Minister of Economy under Videla's administration== By 1975, Argentina had considerably developed, but was nevertheless in the throes of some of the worst instability since 1930. Argentine public opinion turned to the military, who deposed Isabel Per√≥n's weak regime in a March 1976 coup.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jorge- Rafael-Videla Inheriting a wave of violence and 700% inflation, Jorge Rafael Videla called on Mart√≠nez de Hoz as Minister of Economy.https://www.britannica.com/place/Argentina/Military-government-1966-73 Anxious to restore business confidence, announced a plan to further open Argentina's markets, believing that the country's national industry was inefficient and uncompetitive internationally. He moved to lessen Argentina's trade barriers quickly, which he believed to be a cause of economic isolation. He enjoyed the personal friendship of David Rockefeller, who facilitated Chase Manhattan Bank and International Monetary Fund loans of nearly US$1 billion following his appointment.https://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/lo-que-pienso-de- martinez-de-hoz/ He eliminated all price control systems. The black market and shortages disappeared; and he repealed the exchange control regime. A single floating exchange rate was born.http://martinezdehoz.com/words/Los_anios_de_Martinez_de_Hoz_por_Juan_Alemann.pdf He freed exports (removed existing prohibitions and quotas and export taxes were repealed) and imports (removed existing prohibitions, quotas, and licenses and gradually reduced import tariffs).http://martinezdehoz.com/politica_economica.php He decreed a general freeze on wages, and instituted a value-added tax while rescinding the inheritance tax. As a result of the changes instituted by Mart√≠nez de Hoz, inflation fell sharply; but, many local retailers and home builders became incapable of coping with the fall in demand and declared bankruptcy.Lewis, Paul.The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. He eliminated political tariffs for public services and subsidized prices for fuels, to begin an honest look at the economy and the subsidies and overprotections for privileged sectors of the economy. A year later, the billion-dollar trade deficit had turned around and business investment had soared by about 25%. However, real wages had lost nearly 40% of their purchasing power, and while consumer spending remained weak, the shock might have been worse but for hitherto high savings rates. Inflation revived again, and Mart√≠nez de Hoz responded in June 1977, with deregulation of the financial markets, removing checks on banks and transferring responsibility for any bad loans to the state, which took charge of their debt as needed.Crawley, Eduardo. Argentina: A House Divided. St. Martin's Press, 1985. The Central Bank, like many key economic posts in the Mart√≠nez de Hoz era, was led by one of a number of Chicago Boys: Adolfo Diz. Diz enacted much of the Economy Minister's financial deregulation policy, while moving to limit domestic credit. He enacted the Monetary Regulation Account Law of 1977, which raised reserve requirements to 45% of deposits, thereby doubling borrowers' interest rates while eliminating yields on demand deposits.de Pablo, Juan Carlos. Economists and Economic Policy: Argentina since 1958. Total GDP grew 2.2% equivalent annually between 1975 and 1980. Between 1975 and 1979 there was a trade surplus, only in 1980 did the trade deficit appear. During the period, the lowest unemployment rates in the history of the Argentine economy were observed. Particularly from 1979, as a consequence of the second oil shock, the external debt increased strongly.http://www.martinezdehoz.com/words/mhoz_nicolas_marquez.pdf Years later he explained in his books that his management \\"had a 'gradualist' character; he set out to implement a structural reform of the economy, and not just overcome a crisis. On April 2, 1976, three programs were announced: liberation and modernization of the economy, modernization of the state and stabilization of prices. They would have to be applied interconnected, although not necessarily simultaneously. The great courses of action were the subsidiary function of the State and the opening of the economy.\\"‚Äùhttp://www.martinezdehoz.com/words/Libro_De_Pablo.pdf Short-term financial speculation flourished, while chronic tax evasion and budget deficits remained high. Frequent wage freeze decrees continued to depress living standards generally and income inequality increased. During his tenure, the foreign debt increased fourfold, and disparities between the upper and lower classes became much more pronounced.Lewis, Paul.The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. The period ended in a tenfold devaluation and one of the worst financial crises in Argentine history.Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth, World Bank Press, 1993. ===\\"Sweet money\\"=== Again in recession by 1978, the economy continued to be saddled with inflation around 175%. Image-conscious and so, fearful of possible riots, Mart√≠nez de Hoz relented and in December, he issued new, more generous wage guidelines. To address his fellow conservatives' fear that this might lead to even higher inflation, he introduced a novel take on the currency crawling peg: fixed, progressively smaller devaluations of the official exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the US dollarset by a monthly timetable, popularly known as the Tablita. The Tablita invariably set a slower depreciation of the peso value than what local inflation warranted and although inflation did ease somewhat, imported goods and foreign credit soon became much cheaper than those locally available. Imports almost tripled in volume and by 1980, the peso became one of the most overvalued currencies in the world; its high purchasing power abroad soon had many referring to it as sweet money. Record numbers of Argentines now vacationed abroad, often stocking up on appliances; between the suddenly negative trade deficit and tourists' foreign spending, however, this chalked up a then-record US$4 billion annual loss for the national balance sheet in both 1980 and 1981. Having already suffered from weakened demand, many industries (particularly smaller factories) could not compete with the flood of imports and a second wave of industry bankruptcies began. Ostensibly to avoid a sharp rise in unemployment, Mart√≠nez de Hoz took an even more controversial step when he decided to begin absorbing private sector debts (mostly those of the well- connected, including US$700 million of Acindar's)Inversiones millonarias en medio de los cortes de energ√≠a into the national debt. One of his chief business interests, the insolvent Compa√±√≠a Italo Argentina de Electricidad, was nationalised at his orders at a reported cost of US$394 million.Buenos Aires Econ√≥mico: La saga de los Mart√≠nez de Hoz The economy was still in relatively high gear and, with rising fiscal revenues, the nation's finances appeared healthy during 1979 and 1980. Secretly, however (as much of this data was censored at time), local speculators were taking advantage of the overvalued peso by taking up over US$30 billion in loans overseas.National Geographic Magazine. Argentina's New Beginning, August 1986. This money soon found itself in risky gambles at home and abroad and when one bank's Ponzi scheme collapsed in March 1980, Mart√≠nez de Hoz responded to the possible panic by luring investors with one-year treasury bills, paying 60% in US dollars. Facing these pressures, the Argentine peso increasingly became the object of short-selling by insiders, including Mart√≠nez de Hoz himself. ===Circular 1050 and the shattered Tablita=== Mart√≠nez de Hoz addresses the nation in a 12 March 1981, farewell address The end of his tenure soon near and increasingly unpopular, in April 1980 Mart√≠nez de Hoz had the Central Bank promulgate new regulations governing adjustable loans. The Central Bank Circular 1050 tied monthly loan interest payments (almost all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable basis) to the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis the peso. Borrowers were confident that the gradual peso devaluations would continue on schedule and new homeowners rushed to secure (or refinance) mortgages at these favourable terms. Brokerage houses proliferated as put options against the peso increased sharply and in February 1981, Mart√≠nez de Hoz announced the unthinkable: the time had come for a sharp devaluation. The Tablita was shattered and he retired the following month. What followed was one of the worst financial crises in the history of modern Argentina. Speculators quickly took advantage of the 1977 deregulation to write off their debts, legitimate borrowers (including many large employers) were faced with suddenly unaffordable US dollar payments and homeowners' monthly payments (tied by the Circular 1050 to the value of the Dollar), rose by over tenfold during the next fifteen months.Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth.

In July, the new Central Bank President, Domingo Cavallo, rescinded the hated \\"1050\\". Thousands were saved from financial ruin by this change, but the economic damage would remain. Business confidence was destroyed by the whole calamity and even though Argentina's productive Agricultural sector brought in over US$34 billion in trade surpluses over the next eight years, none of it sufficed to deal with chronic capital flight or the newly monstrous public debt (US$7 billion at the start of the dictatorship, it had grown to US$43 billion by the time of the restoration of democracy in 1983). 1983 general elections Mart√≠nez de Hoz was himself indicted in 1988 for his involvement in the human rights abuses at Acindar and spent 77 days in jail.

It is the Main Operating Base of the NATO Boeing E-3 Sentry Component, one of two operational elements of the NATO Airborne Early Warning & Control Force. == Location and history == NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen is located in the Federal Republic of Germany, near the village of Teveren and six kilometers west of the town of Geilenkirchen. The base is known to the local population as ‚ÄòFlugplatz Teveren‚Äô and has an area of . Part of the base perimeter is adjacent to the German-Dutch border. Surrounded by farmland and a natural woodland reserve, the base was originally built by the Royal Air Force after World War II and operated as RAF Geilenkirchen from 1953 onwards. Various RAF fighter squadrons were based there from 1953 until 1968. Flying operations at Geilenkirchen ended in January 1968 and the installation was handed over to the German Air Force in March 1968. In August of that year it became the home of the German Missile Wing 2, which was equipped with Pershing missiles and supported by the 85th U.S. Army Field Artillery Detachment of the U.S. Army. Following NATO's decision to establish the NATO Airborne Early Warning & Control Force program and to make the base near Teveren the Main Operating Base (MOB) of the E-3A Component, a major construction program was started in 1980 to modify the operational and support facilities. In January 1980 the first E-3A Component personnel started arriving at the base, and in October 1980 the NATO Defense Planning Committee (DPC) granted the E-3A Component the status of a NATO International Military Headquarters. By the end of 1981, the German Pershing Wing had left the base and moved to Niederheid, north of Geilenkirchen, while the U.S. 85th Field Artillery Detachment remained on base until July 1991 and was then de-activated. E-3A Component flying operations began in February 1982 after delivery of the first E-3A aircraft. Germany formally handed over the Main Operating Base to NATO on 31 March 1982. The Component was officially activated on 28 June 1982 and reached Full Operational Capability by the end of 1988. Major construction on the base initially included a new runway with a width of , as well as aprons and taxiways, a control tower, an Information Technology Wing building (which also houses flight simulator and mission simulator facilities), on-base accommodation and major renovation of the four existing hangars. Since that time, most of the buildings on base have been renovated to present day standards and several new buildings have been erected. == NATO E-3A Component == The E-3A Component is NATO's first operational flying unit with multinational manning.http://www.e3a.nato.int/eng/home.htm NATO E-3A Component home page The Component commander's position is of Brigadier General rank and is held alternately by Germany and the USA. The Component's organizational structure comprises a Headquarters staff and five major functional elements (Operations Wing, Logistics Wing, Base Support Wing, Training Wing and Information Technology Wing). Each Wing is commanded by a Colonel, each from a different NATO member nation. The Component's multinational, fully integrated workforce consists of more than 3,000 military and civilian personnel from 16 NATO member nations. This figure includes personnel assigned to support functions, such as the engineering support teams of the Bundeswehr Service Centre, National Support Unit personnel, and morale and welfare activities staff. == Operations == Boeing B-52H at Geilenkirchen The Component operates fourteen (out of an original order for 18) Boeing E-3A AWACS aircraft all of which are based on the Boeing 707 airframe (the component also operated three (3) Boeing 707 Trainer Cargo Aircraft, but these have been retired since 2011). These 14 aircraft of the NATO E-3A Component are all registered in Luxembourg as part of that country's contribution to the NATO AWACS programme. Since coming into service in the early 1980s, the aircraft and their onboard systems and associated ground-based equipment have undergone regular upgrading. Two major modernization programmes have been accomplished since the early 1990s. The more recent of these, the MidTerm Modernization Programme, was completed in December 2018. It included the retrofitting of 14 E-3As with improved navigation systems, digital communication systems and five additional workstations, as well as the enhancement of two Mission Simulators. As a result of this project the NATO AWACS will be able to continue to fulfill its intended role as an important NATO asset for maintaining peace and security. The Component's two operational E-3A squadrons and its former TCA squadron have a total of thirty multinational aircrews from 17 of NATO's 29 nations: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Romania, and the United States. Canada withdrew its participation from the AWACS program in 2014, but rejoined in 2019.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/trudeau-government- reverses-conservative-decision-on-awacs-canada-now-contributing-again In addition, the Aircrew Training Squadron operates on an equally multinational basis under the direction of Training Wing. Normally, only a certain number of the E-3As are present at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen at any given time. The remainder are deployed to the Component's Forward Operating Bases in Greece, Italy, Turkey, and the Forward Operating Location in Norway, or to locations elsewhere. Each of these forward operating facilities is located on a national airbase. The Component has approximately thirty military and civilian assigned personnel at each site; these are NATO personnel, but all are from the respective host nation. == Economic significance == The E-3A Component directly employs more than 3,000 personnel at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen and therefore has a significant economic impact in the surrounding communities.http://www.e3a.nato.int/eng/html/economic_impact_en.htm An Economic Impact Study compiled by the NATO E-3A Component shows a 2008 economic impact of 275.8 million euro within a 200-kilometer radius of the base (expenditure of ‚Ç¨150.7 million on staff payroll and ‚Ç¨81.3 million on base-related expenditures, plus a further ‚Ç¨43.8 million impact through indirect creation of jobs in the region surrounding the base). This marks an increase of 10.7 million euro locally. The 2008 overall economic impact was 447.3 million euro, an increase of 22.8 million euro as compared to 2007. These numbers are under the assumption that the economic impact models used for bases located within the US transfer without modification to the EU situation. ==Noise pollution controversy== The fleet of E-3's has remained in operation since the Cold War and has adapted its mission to emerging security threats, primarily in European airspace.

The Gray (Grey) Goose Laws () are a collection of laws from the Icelandic Commonwealth period. The term Gr√°g√°s was originally used in a medieval source to refer to a collection of Norwegian laws and was probably mistakenly used to describe the existing collection of Icelandic law during the sixteenth century. The Gr√°g√°s laws in Iceland were presumably in use until 1262‚Äì1264 when Iceland was taken over by the Norwegian crown. == Origins of Icelandic Law == According to Ari Thorgilsson, the earliest Icelandic laws were modeled on those from the Norwegian west-coast law-province, Gulathing. These were introduced to Iceland by an immigrant from Norway named √ölflj√≥tr, sometime during the 920's. Following several years of modification and revision, √ölflj√≥tr's laws were approved by an initial assembly. Out of this meeting, the annual general assembly known as the Althing was established. Each following summer, Icelanders would convene at Thingvellir for legislative and judicial meetings which would be supervised by the Lawspeaker. ==Etymology== The term \\"Gray Goose Laws\\", used to describe the laws of the Icelandic Commonwealth by the 16th century, may refer to the following: * the fact that the laws were written with a goose quill, * the fact that the laws were bound in goose skin, or * because of the age of the laws‚Äîit was then believed that geese lived longer than other birds. == Manuscripts == The existing Icelandic Commonwealth laws that now exist as the Gr√°g√°s never actually existed in one complete volume during medieval times. The Gr√°g√°s does not contain a unified body of law, as arguably one never existed in the Icelandic Commonwealth. Instead, the Gr√°g√°s was derived from two smaller, fragmentary volumes known as the Konungsb√≥k (Copenhagen, Royal Library, GKS 1157 fol), apparently written around 1260, and Sta√∞arh√≥lsb√≥k (Reykjav√≠k, √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies, AM 334 fol), apparently written in 1280. The ornate detail and appearance of the volumes suggests that they were created for a wealthy, literate man, though scholars cannot be certain. Because the Gr√°g√°s laws originally existed in two different forms, each has a unique written account of the law. Sometimes the Konungsb√≥k and Sta√∞arh√≥lsb√≥k present different information, sometimes complementary information, and sometimes contradictory information. This could represent the way in which the law was interpreted differently by different scribes or by different citizens. According to the Gr√°g√°s, one third of the Icelandic laws were recited by the Law Speaker at the Icelandic national parliament, the Al√æingi, each year over a three-year period. In 1117 the Al√æingi decided that all the laws should be written down and this was accomplished at Hafli√∞i M√°sson‚Äôs farm over that winter and published the following year. These laws remained in force until 1271‚Äì1273 at which time the Ironside Laws‚Äîbased on Norwegian laws‚Äîwere adopted. There is scholarly disagreement, however, about how representative the Gr√°g√°s are regarding the legal tradition that existed during Viking age Iceland. Arguably, the codification of oral law in the Gr√°g√°s better represents Icelandic legal tradition post-Christianity, thus after the year 1000. ==Contents== The sections of law contained within the Gr√°g√°s are: *Christian Laws Section *Assembly Procedures Section *Treatment of Homicide *The Wergild Ring List (see Weregild) *The Lawspeaker's Section *The Law Council Section ==References== ===Editions and translations=== * Vilhj√°lmur Finsen (ed. and trans.), Gr√°g√°s: Isl√¶ndernes lovbog i fristatens tid, udg. efter det kongelige Bibliotheks Haanskrift, 2 vols (Copenhagen: Berling, 1852), http://www.septentrionalia.net/etexts/gragas.pdf.

She acted as housekeeper to Robert Emmet and was also a cousin of two leading United Irish rebels, Michael Dwyer and Arthur Devlin. ==Revolutionary involvement== Grave of Anne Devlin, Glasnevin, Dublin Devlin was born in Rathdrum County Wicklow to a family of long-standing nationalist views, but despite this was asked to move to Dublin to live with her landlord‚Äôs sister-in-law following the latter's marriage. Following the outbreak of the rebellion of 1798, her family home was often raided and many of her family members imprisoned. After the acquittal and release from Wicklow Gaol of her father in 1800, her family moved to Rathfarnham, Co. Dublin, where she met Robert Emmet who was leasing a house in nearby Butterfield Lane from where he was planning his intended uprising. The constant coming and going of men and materials from the house worried Emmet who feared that the activity might arouse the suspicions of the authorities. As a consequence, Anne's father Bryan was approached by Emmet for help and he suggested Anne's sister would act as housekeeper in order to convey an impression of normality. But she was too timid so Anne volunteered instead. Although the ruse proved successful and the rising seemed to have taken the authorities by surprise, the lack of support among the people and some confusion in the rebel ranks led to its collapse and disintegration into a night of bloody street clashes. Shortly after the rising was quashed, a party of yeomen arrived at Butterfield Lane seizing Anne and her eight-year- old sister. Anne was interrogated, including the use of half-hanging but, finding out little of consequence, the yeomen eventually departed. Shortly after returning to live in her family home in Rathfarnham the entire family was seized by the military, having been informed on by a neighbour. ==Arrest and imprisonment== Headstone of Anne Devlin, Glasnevin, Dublin Her importance and central role in the conspiracy was noted and Anne was interrogated in Dublin Castle by Henry Charles Sirr, Chief of Police in Dublin and arrestor of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. She refused bribes and resisted threats to inform on Emmet. She was then sent to Kilmainham Gaol and further interrogated where Emmet himself urged her to inform on him to save herself as he was already doomed. She was kept in squalid conditions and subjected to brutal treatment but consistently refused to cooperate despite her entire family being jailed in an effort to break her, which resulted in the death of her nine-year-old brother from illness brought on by the conditions of his confinement. She was eventually released in 1806 and later married William Campbell in 1811, having four children. Although financially supported by sympathisers for a number of years following her release, she ended her days in poverty, and died in obscurity in the Liberties area of Dublin in 1851. She is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in a grave she was moved to by historian R.R. Madden and friends in 1852. There is now a large Celtic cross on her grave, and the grave is in the care of the National Graves Association.http://www.nga.ie Anne's husband William remains buried in the original grave which Anne purchased on his death in 1846.

His sister, violinist Megan Childs, was also a member of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, and their father Lynn played on some Gorky's recordings, most notably on Barafundle. Childs was born in Freshwater East, Pembrokeshire, and was educated at the Welsh-medium school Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Myrddin in Carmarthenshire. ==Career== Childs was a founder of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and stayed with the band throughout its lifetime, writing or co-writing most songs, handling most lead vocals, and playing keyboards, among other instruments. His first solo music appeared in 2005, and his first single, \\"Donkey Island\\", was released on Wichita Recordings in November of that year. His band for the subsequent UK tour included Gorky's drummer Peter Richardson and fellow Welsh musician Alun Tan Lan, who also has occasionally opened for Childs. Childs' first solo album, Chops, was released on Wichita in February 2006, quickly followed by the other single from the album, \\"Costa Rita\\". By the middle of 2006, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci had announced their split, allowing Childs and Richard James to focus on their solo projects. Childs' second solo album, the all-Welsh language Bore Da, was released in March 2007. This was followed in August of the same year by The Miracle Inn. His fourth album, Cheer Gone, was released in October 2008. It was recorded over six days in Nashville with a band that included Richardson and Stephen Black, and had contributions from several Nashville musicians including Matt Swanson of Lambchop. In 2009, Childs released his fifth album, Son of Euro Child, on his newly formed label National Elf. The album was available as a free download as well as on CD, and it began his current trend of releasing all his music through his official website on a \\"pay what you can\\" basis. 2009 also saw Childs form the duo Jonny with Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake. They released their debut, Jonny, in 2011. The album Ends was released on 28 November 2011. Its songs consist mostly of vocals and piano, with Megan Childs contributing violin on four of the 10 tracks. In 2012, Childs established another duo, Cousins, this time with Race Horses' Meilyr Jones, who had previously appeared on Bore Da and The Miracle Inn. Their album First Cousins was released on 12 March 2012 on National Elf. Childs and Peter Richardson have recorded under the name Ymarfer Corff. Childs has also been a member of Short & Curlies with frequent collaborators Stephen Black and Megan Childs, among others. Summer Special was released on 20 August 2012, with a band consisting of Childs, Jones, Black, Stuart Kidd, and Megan Childs. The first single and video was \\"That's Better\\". The second single was \\"Be Be High\\" with the non-album B-side \\"The Surgeon\\". The album Situation Comedy was released on 21 October 2013, preceded by the single \\"T√™te √† T√™te\\" on 14 October. In his NME review that rated the album 8/10, Tom Pinnock called it \\"a set of witty piano-pop songs\\" with \\"a grim undertone\\". He opined that the closing 14-minute track \\"Trick of the Mind\\" was \\"perhaps Childs' most beautiful song ever\\". In late 2014, Childs released his new album Eilaag, on CD and download through his website. Seven of the nine tracks are instrumental pieces for solo piano, the other two being solo vocal pieces accompanied by solo piano. His 11th studio album, Sweetheart came out on 2 October 2015. It featured a full band consisting of Marco Rea (guitar/backing vocals), Stuart Kidd (drums/backing vocals), Rhydian Jones (bass) and Laura J. Martin (flute). The album was recorded by Iwan Morgan in the village of Freshwater East. On 9 December 2016, the next Childs album Refresh! was released on his label National Elf, preceded by streaming of the song Pick It Up (a song about cleaning after one's dog). Refresh! was recorded in collaboration with Stephen Black (Sweet Baboo) at Gus Dungeon II Studios, Cardiff, and consists of 24 songs made entirely of Euros's voice fed through a sampler, with exception of synth on Pick It Up and toy piano on Sky / Sea. As usual, the album is available on download, CD and vinyl. In January 2017 Childs released an EP collaboration with Rosie Smith of Oh Peas! under the name Tim's Rice. The EP, Mixed Ability Pilates, was available as a pay-what- you-like download. Childs's next album, House Arrest, will be released on 17 November 2017. It was recorded at Gus Dungeon Studios (i.e. his Pembrokeshire home) and features the single My Colander. The album release will be accompanied by a full UK tour, Childs's first since 2015. On 16 January 2019, Teenage Fanclub announced that Childs had joined them on keyboards and vocals. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Chops (13 February 2006) *Bore Da (5 March 2007) *The Miracle Inn (27 August 2007) *Cheer Gone (27 October 2008) *Son of Euro Child (7 September 2009) *Face Dripping (6 December 2010) *Ends (28 November 2011) *Summer Special (20 August 2012) *Situation Comedy (21 October 2013) *Eilaaig (24 November 2014) *Sweetheart (2 October 2015) *Refresh!

At the time the Justice League was featured in three separate series: Justice League America, Justice League Europe (JLE) and Justice League Quarterly (JLQ). Justice League Task Force was a spinoff of Justice League Europe, a series which ran from April 1989 to May 1993. Like JLE, this team carried a United Nations charter which sanctioned their activities. In fact, JLTF was composed of several former JLE members. The team was called to action by Hannibal Martin, a representative of the U.N.. He asked that Martian Manhunter select a \\"strike team\\" of fellow Justice League members and to \\"lead them on a very special mission\\".Justice League Task Force #1, page 14 ==Publication history== ===Creative teams=== Because of the varied nature of the missions the Task Force would be employed on, and the versatility of the concept, various writers and artists were featured on this title. Up to issue #13 most writers wrote only up to three issues (even the series' creator David Michelinie only wrote the first three issues, although a misprint on the cover of issue #5 credited him with the story, but it was actually written by Denny O'Neil), which changed when Mark Waid came on board, who wrote Justice League Task Force for eight issuesJustice League Task Force #0, 13-15, 17-20 and changed the concept to what it would ultimately become. His last few issues were co- written with Christopher Priest, who came on at issue #18 and wrote the title up to its cancellation at issue #37. Similar to the role of the writers, few pencillers stuck around for more than one or two issues, with exception being Sal Velluto, who, alongside David Michelinie created the book, and pencilled 22 issues of the title.Justice League Task Force #0-3, 5-8, 10-15, 17-24 The only other regular artist was Ramon Bernado, who pencilled nine issues in totalJustice League Task Force #27-30, 33-37 and pencilled the title's last few issues. ==Biography== ===Membership=== Because the Justice League Task force had a variable line-up, there was no definite number of stable members, aside from the Martian Manhunter and Gypsy, who (with the exception of issue #9 in Gypsy's case) appeared in every issue of the run. Other members who made regular appearances include Triumph, Ray, L-Ron (in Despero's body) and Mystek. ====One mission==== *Aquaman (Arthur Curry)Justice League Task Force #1-3 *Batman/Azrael (Jean-Paul Valley)Justice League Task Force #5-6 *Batman (Bruce Wayne) *Bloodwynd *Booster Gold (Michael Jon Carter) *DolphinJustice League Task Force #7-8 *GeistJustice League Task Force #9 *Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) *Joe Public *Hourman (Rex Tyler) *Krag *Lionheart *Loose Cannon *Maxima *Nightwing (Dick Grayson) *Robin (Tim Drake) *Seneca *Vixen ====Up to five missions==== *Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance)Justice League Task Force #10-12 *Blue Beetle (Ted Kord), *Bronze Tiger (Ben Turner)Justice League Task Force #0 *Captain Atom (Nathaniel Adam) *Crimson Fox *Dr. Light (Kimiyo Hoshi) *DamageJustice League Task Force #25 *Elongated Man (Randolph William Dibny) *Fire (Beatriz da Costa) *Flash (Wally West)Justice League Task Force #13-14Justice League Task Force #15Justice League Task Force #16 *Maxima *Maya *Metamorpho (Rex Mason) *Power Girl *Tasmanian Devil *Osiris *Thunderbolt (Peter Cannon) *Wonder Woman ====More than five missions==== *GypsyJustice League Task Force #1-8, 10-15, 17-37 *L-Ron (in the body of Despero)Justice League Task Force #0, 13-33, 37 *Martian ManhunterJustice League Task Force #1-37 *MystekJustice League Task Force #25-32 *Ray (Ray Terrill)Justice League Task Force #0, 13-15, 17-26.

They enlist the aid of Count Jeremy Glass, who produces a superlaser that \\"projects death from miles away\\", a device the rebels are reluctant to use. Nightwing is assigned by Hannibal Martin to stop Sierra on his own. Meanwhile the Task Force engages the rebels. During an ensuing fight at the palace, Ramos hurries to shut down the superlaser and finds himself in Nightwing's sights, but, in a crisis of conscience, the superhero cannot pull the trigger. Ultimately, Ramos destroys the machine, but at the cost of his own life. As the story ends, Rafael Sierra becomes President, and Martin reveals that he selected Nightwing because he knew that the hero would never kill; he intended Nightwing to fail. Nightwing and Flash quit the team in anger. Gypsy proceeds to go on a solo mission in issue #4, in which she and the Martian Manhunter (who follows Gypsy) defeat Sa'ar, the Ageless One. Afterward the team becomes involved with the KnightQuest, in which they aid Bruce Wayne in the search of Dr. Kinsolving and Jack Drake (father of Tim Drake, the third Robin. The team next encompasses a complete female membership (including a shapeshifted Martian Manhunter) in order to save the life of Henry R. Haggard, who carries with him a deadly virus, from a savage female tribe. Martian Manhunter is faced with more trouble when two New Blood heroes, Joe Public and Geist seek his mentorship, but by the end of the tale in issue #9, they revoke their membership in the League, confident that they're not cut out to be superheroes. Next, the Aryan Nation plans to release a virus that will kill any non-Aryan in Northern America. The League is capable of infiltrating the group, but are soon compromised when one the Nation's members recognizes Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt. The League eventually manages to escape with the help of Hourman (Rex Tyler) and stop the virus from being spread. After the mission, Hannibal Martin reveals the return of L-Ron, still inhabitting the body of old foe Despero, to warn the team of the coming threat of the Overmaster. Shortly afterward, the Justice League collectively faces the Overmaster, who kills the superheroine Ice in Justice League Task Force #14. During the assault on Overmaster's citadel, Gypsy is left behind in an Arctic wasteland as the main group forged forward, leading her to quit the team after the battle. The Task Force then become embroiled in the Zero Hour conflict, and Triumph, a hero retconned into having been a founding member of the original Justice League, appears and joins the team. After Zero Hour, the Martian Manhunter and L-Ron assemble a new group, making the Task Force a training ground for new heroes, and the team consists of themselves, Triumph, the Ray and a returned Gypsy.Justice League Task Force #0, 15-16 ===A new team and purpose=== The cover to Justice League Task Force #0 featuring the new team. Art by Sal Velluto/Jeff Albrecht. The new team seemingly fits well together, but Gypsy has trouble reconciling with the fact that the Despero on the team is not the Despero that killed her parents. As they train together, they are called to aid Vandal Savage, whose supply of replacement body parts and organs has been stolen. They are able to uncover the perpetrator, but do not allow Vandal Savage to kill her, earning them his wrath as he destroys their headquarters.Justice League Task Force #17-21 Gypsy's fears are later added to when she and the team face Baron ≈∞man von Mauler, who believes Gypsy to be his long-dead wife Nakia. She narrowly defeats him, and proceeds to hitchhike her way through Romania, leaving behind her teammates.

Invisible formal methods are hidden by automated model transformations projecting system models into various mathematical domains (and, preferably, vice versa). In this way, VIATRA2 nicely complements other model transformation tools within the www.eclipse.org/gmt initiative. The most traditional application area for VIATRA2 ‚Äì started as early as 1998 ‚Äì is to support the transformation-based dependability analysis of system models taken from various application areas (safety-critical and/or embedded systems, robust e-business applications, middleware, service oriented architecture) described using various modeling languages (BPM, UML, etc.) during a model-driven systems engineering process. Such a model (and transformation)-based dependability analysis typically also includes the verification and validation, the testing, the safety and security analysis as well as the early assessment non-functional characteristics (such as reliability, availability, responsiveness, throughput, etc.) of the system under design. In addition, model transformations for specification, design, deployment, optimization or code generation in traditional model-driven systems engineering are also focal areas for VIATRA2. == Approach == Since precise model-based systems development is the primary application area of VIATRA2, it necessitates that (i) the model transformations are specified in a mathematically precise way, and (ii) these transformations are automated so that the target mathematical models can be derived fully automatically. For this purpose, VIATRA2 have chosen to integrate two popular, intuitive, yet mathematically precise rule-based specification formalisms, namely, graph transformation (GT) and Abstract State Machines (ASM) to manipulate graph based models. The basic concept in defining model transformations within VIATRA2 is the (graph) pattern. A pattern is a collection of model elements arranged into a certain structure fulfilling additional constraints (as defined by attribute conditions or other patterns). Patterns can be matched on certain model instances, and upon successful pattern matching, elementary model manipulation is specified by graph transformation rules. Like OCL, graph transformation rules describe pre- and postconditions to the transformations, but graph transformation rules are guaranteed to be executable, which is a main conceptual difference. Graph transformation rules are assembled into complex model transformations by abstract state machine rules, which provide a set of commonly used imperative control structures with precise semantics. Models and modeling languages and transformations are all stored uniformly in the so-called VPM model space, which provides a very flexible and general way for capturing languages and models on different meta-levels and from various domains (or technological spaces). Generic and meta-transformations (type parameters, rules manipulating other rules) for providing reuse of transformations are a unique specification feature of VIATRA2 (up to our knowledge) at least among tools based on graph transformation. == Conformance to related standards == While on the one hand, the underlying modeling and transformation concepts of VIATRA2 are nonstandard (i.e. the VPM metamodeling core is more expressive than MOF, and the transformation language is not QVT), on the other hand, VIATRA2 plans to support these related standards by offering (i) powerful and extensible model importers and exporters and (ii) domain specific languages integrated to the framework as VIATRA2 (and thus Eclipse) plug-ins. For instance, the QVT standard is intended to be supported by translating QVT descriptions into ASM and GT rules. Model importers accepting the XMI-based models of the state-of-the-art UML modeling tools (such as IBM Rational Software Architect) will be part of the initial contribution, and importers for additional tools will be added later on. == Target audience and end users == The VIATRA2 framework currently serves as the underlying model transformation technology of the ongoing DECOS European IP in the field of dependable embedded systems. Moreover, VIATRA2 will serve as a key underlying model transformation technology for several additional projects on the European level which will start in the upcoming 6 months. In this way, academic and industrial partners in these projects would become the first end users of the framework, and they would highly benefit from an open source initiative. These projects would provide noticeable international visibility to VIATRA2 as well as the entire GMT project. Moreover, many interesting directions for future developments have already been evolved (and will continuously evolve) using the feedbacks from partners. == See also == * Model Driven Engineering (MDE) * Model Driven Architecture (MDA) * Domain Specific Language (DSL) * Model Transformation Language (MTL) * MOF Queries/Views/Transformations (MOF QVT) * ATLAS Transformation Language (ATL) * XML transformation language (XML TL) == External links == * The VIATRA2 Subproject at Eclipse.org Category:Unified Modeling Language Category:Graph rewriting ","title":"VIATRA"},{"id":"3257391","text":"Ing√°lvur av Reyni (18 December 1920 ‚Äì 26 November 2005) was the most celebrated painter of the Faroe Islands during the last years. Ing√°lvur av Reyni was born in T√≥rshavn. He rebelled through his expressionism against the epic content of his predecessors' art, and has opened up new paths in his painting. His art is characterised by a clear, French colourist tone, and his artistic roots go back to Paul C√©zanne and Henri Matisse. The powerful nature of the Faroes, which makes an immediate visual impact on any painter, is the all-embracing theme in Reyni's art. But he experiences nature from the inside, as structures, tones, and fragments of a universe offering opportunities for graphical treatment of form and movement, light colours and rhythms. The expressions of nature become the basis of an increasingly abstract idiom. The light fills his landscapes, interiors and figure paintings from the 1940s and 1950s, where he characteristically simplifies the motif in cubist style. The lines and forms of nature contribute to the strict, cubist-inspired composition of the picture, or they are subjected to it. The composition is free of all unnecessary elements, and the work becomes at the same time a picture of both the inner and the outer reality. Increasingly contrasting colours are set against each other, until the culmination at the end of the 1950s with the bold counterplay of complementary colours. A solo exhibition in T√≥rshavn in 1961 broke new ground, showing for the first time a directly abstract perception of nature. The paintings had titles such as Kurpali (chaos, disorder) and Sj√≥n √≠ fuglaeyga (view through a bird's eye) This exhibition did not herald an instant conversion to non-figurative art ‚Äì in the 1960s and well into the 1970s Ing√°lvur av Reyni treated landscape motifs as never before, although in a highly abstract way, especially the central theme of the village by the sea. His palettes vary from clear, powerful and glowing colours through a delicate greyish, anything but dry spectrum to the deep black register. A series of works from the 1970s are abstractions of groups of figures and have titles such as girl or people by the sea, as can be seen in a trilogy owned by the art museum. In most recent years Ing√°lvur av Reyni has chiefly been an abstract painter, if this expression can apply to non- figurative art which is based on nature's own tones and structures. In his strongly painted, usually large and resolute compositions, the work breaks out from the inside. Warm earth tones glow from the deepest layers, sizzle when they touch cold, grey areas, and set light to others. The drama lies in the conflict of the colours and the dynamic movements of the brushstrokes. From time to time the rhythm is further emphasised by scratches made with the handle of the brush in the thick, varnish-like layers of shiny colour. This is tangible painting. Ing√°lvur av Reyni was a superb draughtsman. The town with its houses round the harbour, the ships and the boats and the people walking in the streets ‚Äì especially the older townsfolk ‚Äì are favourite subjects. He has an impressive ability to capture an expression in a single concentrated stroke. And his many journeys to the cradles of European art have also led to drawings of figures and groups in teeming crowds, or of interiors and street scenes. The drawings show a pronounced artistic sense for sharp characteristics. But even though these drawings in the cases mentioned are more figurative or narrative than the paintings, their themes are still subject to the strict conditions of the line and its enclosing form. On many occasions he has also produced non-figurative drawings. In 2000 he received the Faroese Cultural Prize (Mentanarhei√∞ursl√∏n Landsins) from the Faroese government. Reyni died at the age of 84 in 2005 in his hometown T√≥rshavn. ==Gallery of stamps== The following Faroese stamps from Postverk F√∏roya feature Reyni's work: Image:Faroe stamp 053 old torshavn (sketches by ingalvur av reyni 01).jpgStamp FR 53 of 1981: Old T√≥rshavn No. 1 Image:Faroe stamp 054 old torshavn (sketches by ingalvur av reyni 02).jpgFR 54: No. 2 Image:Faroe stamp 055 old torshavn (sketches by ingalvur av reyni 03).jpgFR 55: No. 3 Image:Faroe stamp 056 old torshavn (sketches by ingalvur av reyni 04).jpgFR 56: No. 4 Image:Faroe stamp 066 gjogv.jpgStamp FR 66 of 1982: Gj√≥gv.

Welf. & Inst. Code ¬ß 5150(a). ==History of studio 5150== ===Beginnings (1983‚Äì1989)=== In 1983, Eddie Van Halen built his home studio near his home with then wife Valerie Bertinelli. He named it \\"5150\\" after the police code overheard by producer/engineer Donn Landee, one night on his police scanner. Designed by Landee, the beta version of 5150 Studios was a high-ceilinged sixteen-track studio suitable for recording, overdubbing, and simple mixing, if needed. The recording room was roughly , sound insulated with fiberglass and rubber, with a booth on the north end. The construction on Eddie's property was passed off to city inspectors as a racquetball court, disregarding the soundproof walls with cinder blocks filled with concrete. A challenge arose in the form of a powerful AM radio antenna from a sports station broadcasting 50,000 watts of power a few miles away. To prevent Eddie picking up boxing fights and football games through his wireless guitars, engineers wrapped a layer of grounded chicken-wire fencing around the studio, turning it into a Faraday cage. ===Remodeling and beyond (1989‚Äìpresent)=== Between February 1989 (after the OU812 Tour ended) and March 1990 (before starting work on For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge), Eddie remodeled the studio, doubling its size, replacing the main mixing board, and at the end of the recording floor, adding an isolated drum room for his brother Alex. When he was finished, it also featured a small arcade for video games and pinball machines. The studio met with controversy as the Hollywood Association of Recording Professionals cracked down on home studios in the Los Angeles area, claiming owners were renting them out and hurting traditional recording studios. Eddie's studio proved otherwise, as Eddie insisted it was for himself to make music. Because of his testimony, he was given the proper zoning variance to legally make music at his house.

One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft (either directly or via a tappet (lifter) and pushrod) while the other end acts on the valve stem. When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm, the inside presses down on the valve stem, opening the valve. When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation, the inside rises, allowing the valve spring to close the valve. Some overhead cam engines employ short rocker arms in which the cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the rocker arm to open the valve. On this type of rocker arm, the fulcrum is at the end rather than the middle, while the cam acts on the middle of the arm. The opposite end opens the valve. These types of rocker arms are particularly common on dual overhead cam motors, and are often used instead of direct tappets. ==Overview== The drive cam is driven by the camshaft. This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the trunnion pin or rocker shaft. Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller tip. A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller tip to a second rocker arm. This rotates about the rocker shaft, and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve. In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head. A roller rocker is a rocker arm that uses bearings instead of metal sliding on metal. It has a wheel on its end like that of a measuring wheel, which rolls by the use of needle bearings. For pushrod engines, roller rockers employ a roller where the rocker contacts the valve stem. Roller rockers can also be used in overhead cam engines. However, these generally have the roller at the point where the cam lobe contacts the rocker, rather than at the point where the rocker contacts the valve stem. This helps to reduce cam lobe friction and wear in the same way as roller lifters on pushrod engines. ==Leverage== The effective leverage of the arm (and thus the force it can exert on the valve stem) is determined by the rocker arm ratio, the ratio of the distance from the rocker arm's center of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrod. Current automotive design favors rocker arm ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1. However, in the past smaller positive ratios (the valve lift is greater than the cam lift) and even negative ratios (valve lift smaller than the cam lift) have been used. Many pre-World War II engines use a 1:1 (neutral) ratio. ==Materials== For car engines the rocker arms are generally steel stampings, providing a reasonable balance of strength, weight and economical cost. Because the rocker arms are, in part, reciprocating weight, excessive mass especially at the lever ends limits the engine's ability to reach high operating speeds. For this reason, aluminum is often used for high performance, aftermarket rocker arms for pushrod engines as well as many OEM rocker arms on OHC engines. Aluminum rockers on OHC engines often have a steel pad or roller where the cam contacts the rocker arm in order to reduce wear. Truck engines (mostly diesel) use stronger and stiffer rocker arms made of cast iron (usually ductile), or forged carbon steel. ==History== Dating back to the 19th century, rocker arms have been made with and without roller tips that press upon the valve. ===Use of alloys=== Many lightweight and high strength alloys, and bearing configurations for the fulcrum, have been used in an effort to increase the RPM limits for high performance applications, eventually lending the benefits of these race bred technologies to more high-end production vehicles. ===Geometry=== Even the design aspects of the rocker arm's geometry has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information exchange to the valve which the rocker arm imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, often referred to as the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with rocker arm design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on valve tips, valve guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the rocker arm's motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID- LIFT Patent set a new standard of rocker arm geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the rocker arm was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its \\"mid-lift\\" point of motion. ==See also== ==External links== *TV commercial jingle about rocker arms Category:Engine technology Category:Engine components Category:Valvetrain ","title":"Rocker arm"},{"id":"3257487","text":"The East Riding of Yorkshire is a unitary authority in the ceremonial county of the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

During his student life he was a classmate of the Japanese Nobel prize awarded writer Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe. During World War II he served in the Japanese Imperial Army. In 1945 he was wanted to become a kamikaze pilot, but the war finished before he was able to enter military school. His family lived with the effects of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. After the war he became a pacifist and criticized extreme nationalism. Within the Japanese academic community he was called \\"the Korean Christ\\" because of his defense of the Korean people; his political position led him to turn down a chair in English Literature at the University of Tokyo. At the end of the Sixties he emigrated to England, where for a brief period he was a professor at the University of Cambridge. Shortly thereafter he traveled to Spain, establishing himself for the long term in the city of Seville. There he became acquainted with numerous professors and Sevillian artists like Fernando Rodr√≠guez-Izquierdo G√°vala, Jos√© Mar√≠a Cabeza La√≠nez, Pablo del Barco and Vicente Haya Segovia. Between 1988 and 1992 he became a senior instructor of Japanese in the University of Seville. In 1999 an invitation by the University of Kitakyushu led to his return to Japan. He fell ill during a trip to Korea, and died in Tokyo of a brain hemorrhage on April 22, 2000. ==Work== Nagakawa's most notable translations include the Japanese version of James Joyce's Ulysses (together with Maruya Saiichi and Takamatsu Yuuichi), and works of William Shakespeare, John Dos Passos and Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul.

The park offers numerous trails for hiking and biking, and boasts a variety of native animal and plant species. ===Plant species=== Native plant species preserved in Black Mountain Open Space Park include both chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Native to the east and north sides of the mountain, the chaparral community includes manzanita, laurel sumac, lemonade berry, coffee berry, chamise, toyon, and California lilac. The coastal sage scrub, native to the south and west faces of the mountain, include white and black sage, California sagebrush, California buckwheat, and California sunflower. ===Animal species=== The Black Mountain Open Space Park is home to a wide variety of animal species. Mammals include mule deer, bobcat, desert woodrat, and Pacific kangaroo rat, and many others. Among the more than 80 birds species that can be found in the park, rare birds like the California gnatcatcher, rufous-crowned sparrow, and northern harrier reside in the area. Reptiles include the red diamond rattlesnake and amphibians include the Pacific chorus frog and slender salamander. ==Black Mountain== Black Mountain as seen from Salmon River Road in Rancho Pe√±asquitos Black Mountain is the central feature of Black Mountain Open Space Park, standing at 1,554 feet (474 m) tall. At its peak, Black Mountain is host to a handful of communication towers, including a retired AT&T; microwave repeater tower and a Verizon wireless communication facility. Prior to European contact, the Kumeyaay lived on the mountain and referred to it as \\"Amat Kwanyil\\". ===Mine=== Tucked away in the Black Mountain canyon is an abandoned arsenic mine, accessible via pathways branching off of the park's Miner's Ridge Loop trail. The mine was established in the 1920s by Escondido rancher, rodeo cowboy, and actor Frank Hopkins, due to the demand for white arsenic, a key ingredient in pesticides that attacked infesting boll weevils. As the boll weevil population shrank, the demand for white arsenic fell, causing the abandoning of the mine in 1927. According to a 1939 article, published in the Vista Press, Hopkins also used this mine to find gold. In 2016, the University of San Diego conducted soil sampling in the vicinity of the mine site. Some locations, including portions of the Miner's Ridge Loop trail revealed high levels of arsenic present. As of January 6, 2017 the San Diego City Attorney recommended closure of the lower sections of the trail pending further study. The Jas Arnold Trail for All People (located at the Miner's Ridge Loop parking lot), a handicapped accessible trail named in honor of the park's long serving Chair of the Citizen's Advisory Committee who passed in May 2016 remains open to the public.

He narrowly escaped being sent to Auschwitz during the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in Paris on 16 July 1942. In early 1943 he left the city to avoid compulsory deportation to Germany as a forced laborer. He spent the rest of the war with the French Resistance, fighting with the Maquis in Touraine. After the war, Babil√©e returned to dance, joining the Soir√©es de la Danse, which later became Les Ballet des Champs Elys√©es.

In several of these ballets he performed opposite his wife, featured ballerina Nathalie Philippart. In the 1940s Babil√©e quickly developed a reputation for his physical prowess. It was said that he could leap better than any dancer since Nijinsky, and in the 1946 premiere of Le Jeune Homme et la Mort he hung by his neck on a gallows for one minute, supported only by wrapping one arm around a pillar. In the 1950s he danced as a guest of Le Ballet de l'Op√©ra de Paris and the American Ballet Theatre, before forming his own company, Les Ballets Jean Babil√©e. In 1972 and 1973 he served as director of the Ballet du Rhin in Strasbourg. In the early 1980s, Maurice B√©jart created the solo Life for him.

Armstrong (October 11, 1911‚Äì1993), aka Z.B. Armstrong, was an outsider artist known for his doomsday calendars. == Life == Armstrong was born in McDuffie County, Georgia near Thomson, Georgia. He attended school until eighth grade when he left and began working in the local cotton fields. He married Ulamay Demmons in 1929 and had two daughters. For much of his life, he worked picking cotton on the local Mack McCormick farm. He supplemented this income by building furniture for people in his community. One of the things Armstrong was most skilled at building were wooden and concrete vaults, which were especially popular in rural communities because of a distrust of banks in the aftermath of the Great Depression. These vaults often incorporated a wide variety of types of locks, handles, and wheels. After his wife died in 1969, he began to work at the Thomson Box Factory, staying there until 1982. Religion was a significant part of Armstrong's life. He was a member of The Solomon Hodges Burial Society, an organization that helped the poor pay for proper burials for family members who had passed. == Art == In 1972, he claimed to be visited by an angel who warned him saying, \\"Our time has gone to waste...Judgement day will come and at what hour only God knows.\\" After this vision, Armstrong became increasingly reclusive. He became increasingly focused on The Book of Revelation and the idea that time was coming to an end. He began to make calendars, in the form of three-dimensional wooden sculptures, that would help predict the date on which Judgement Day would start. Armstrong would add grids to these calendars drawn in black, red and blue permanent marker. Armstrong referred to this process as \\"taping with time.\\"Outsider Art Sourcebook, ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.40 He would also write dates and scripture passages on the calendars in order help further discern the date of Judgement Day. Armstrong went on to construct almost 1,500 box calendars with the aim of trying to determine the exact date of the approaching doomsday. These calendars were built in Armstrong's hand-built two room home. While one room served as his living space, the other room served as his workspace. In that space, he kept not only the calendars and the materials for building the calendars but also many other things that he had built himself. One of the major features of the room was a large box that Armstrong kept on his mantelpiece that held the cards that Armstrong would use to help decide what dates to put on the calendars. His work has been displayed at a number of locations and exhibitions. The first place to display Armstrong's work was a local store called The Corner Cupboard, which in turn led to his work gaining increased notoriety. Armstrong's work has subsequently been featured in several exhibits. Roger Manley used Armstrong's work as an inspiration for and as part of his exhibition The End is Near at the American Visionary Art Museum. A piece of Zebedee Armstrong's entitled \\"Future Predictor Array\\" was showcased as part of the Farfetched: Mad Science, Fringe Architecture, and Visionary Engineering exhibition at Gregg Museum of Art and Design in 2013. == Collections == *Art Museum of Southeast Texas, Beaumont, Texas *Morris Museum of Art, Augusta, Georgia ==References== *\\"Zebedee Armstrong Jr.,\\" Chuck and Jan Rosenak, Museum of American Folk Art Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century American Folk Art and Artists (New York: Abbeville Press), pp. 39-40.

The passing pocket, or the pocket, is a term used in American football to describe the area in the backfield created on a passing play where the offensive line forms a wall of protection around the quarterback. This allows him adequate time to find an open receiver and to pass the ball. The offensive line will drop back slightly, creating a U-shaped protected area for the quarterback to find an open receiver and pass the ball. If the quarterback is unable to find an open receiver, he will attempt to run the ball himself, throw the ball out of bounds to prevent a sack and/or turnover, or if there is no lane, may collapse to the ground to protect the ball and try to avoid a fumble. Even with a well structured offensive line, the quarterback only has seconds to pass the ball within the pocket. Moving the pocket can help avoid a sack. When that fails, quarterbacks may scramble (run around behind the line of scrimmage), either to gain more time for the wide receivers, to avoid a sack, or to rush the ball. ==Tackle box structure== A quarterback at practice, dropping back to pass. The area between the two tackles on the offensive line is referred to as the tackle box. This area itself can be formed using different types of protections to keep the quarterback safe. The offensive tackles set the depth of the tackle box by kick sliding back to around six yards after the snap of the ball. The guards are next in depth and will drop back to around three to four yards and will defend the middle of the pocket along with the center. The different drop-back depths of the linemen helps to create enough space for the quarterback to go through his throwing motion. Sometimes tight ends and running backs may be used as extra blockers to solidify the pocket. ==Pocket protection packages== There are many different player personnel packages that can be used to protect the quarterback. The pocket could be protected by five linemen, two tight ends, as well as two running backs. When two running backs are used, they do constitute the tackle box but they are typically used to clear any stray rushers that may get past the inner linemen. They are used to create more space for the quarterback to step into in order to make a good throw. There can be one or two running backs used along with one or two tight ends depending on the packages called for. Sometimes, running backs and tight ends will partially block an advancing defender quickly, or what's known as \\"chip blocking\\" an advancing defender, and then they will go run their receiving route. Tight ends can do the same thing, which means that the tackles would then have to set the depth of the tackle box. ==Defensive maneuvers== Quarterback Roger Staubach of Navy tosses a pass against Maryland just as the pocket collapses. The defense is trying to break down the tackle box as quickly as possible. They will try to send extra rushers to outnumber the blockers. Another tactic would be to send speed rushers off either side of the offensive line to run around the tackles before they can set the depth of the tackle box. The defensive ends are sometimes able to run past the tackles and get to the quarterback before he can step up into the tackle box to protect himself better. Another maneuver that is used is the middle blitz where the defense sends multiple rushers up the middle of the line in order to get past the center and guards to collapse the tackle box and sack the quarterback. The offensive line cannot block up the middle when too many rushers are running at them. This rushes the quarterback and forces him to get rid of the ball before he is ready to do so. There are many different types of blitzes but their only purpose is to confuse the blockers and ruin the tackle box that is being formed. ==When the tackle box collapses== When the defense succeeds in their goal of confusing the offensive linemen, major problems form for the quarterback. The term that is used when the defense is getting close to the quarterback is that the tackle box is collapsing. When the tackle box collapses, the quarterback is trained to do one of a few different things: to scramble out of the tackle box and look to gain yards by running, to get outside of the tackle box and throw the ball out of bounds, or--in extreme situations--to just take the sack and not lose possession of the football. While the pocket will always collapse eventually, situations where the pocket collapses faster than anticipated create a difficult conundrum for quarterbacks, as they are faced with a plethora of possible choices with virtually no time to choose between them. A quarterback who is able to effectively react to the pocket collapsing and salvage the play is said to have good pocket awareness or pocket presence. == References == Category:American football terminology ","title":"Passing pocket"},{"id":"3257566","text":"Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (, IBAMA) is the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment's administrative arm.\\"Brazilian Federal Law 7.735/1989 (Portuguese)\\". http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l7735.htm IBAMA supports anti- deforestation of the Amazon, and implements laws against deforestation where the government ceases to implement.

Several organizations have developed such sets of principles, which vary by territory. In the United States, the standards are promulgated by the Auditing Standards Board, a division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). AUNote that AU stands for audit, not separate words. See Alphabet Soup: A Director‚Äôs Guide to Financial Literacy and the ABCs of Accounting and Auditing . Section 150 states that there are ten standards:AU Section 150: Generally Accepted Auditing Standards. AICPA. three general standards, three fieldwork standards, and four reporting standards. These standards are issued and clarified Statements of Accounting Standards, with the first issued in 1972 to replace previous guidance. Typically, the first number of the AU section refers to which standard applies. However, in 2012 the Clarity Project significantly revised the standards and replaced AU Section 150 with AU Section 200, which does not explicitly discuss the 10 standards.Morris JT, Thomas T. (2011). Clarified Auditing Standards: The Quiet Revolution. Journal of Accountancy.Summary of Differences Between Clarified SASs and Existing SASs. AICPA. In the United States, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board develops standards (Auditing Standards or AS) for publicly traded companies since the 2002 passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; however, it adopted many of the GAAS initially. The GAAS continues to apply to non-public companies. == General == #The examination is to be performed by a person or persons having adequate technical training and proficiency as an auditor. #In all matters relating to an assignment, an independence in mental attitude is to be maintained by the auditor or auditors. #Due professional care is to be exercised in the performance of the audit and the preparation of the report. ==Standards of Field Work== #The auditor must adequately plan the work and must properly supervise any assistants. #The auditor must obtain a sufficient understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control, to assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud, and to design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures. #The auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence by performing audit procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit. ==Standards of Reporting== #The auditor must state in the auditor's report whether the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. #The auditor must identify in the auditor's report those circumstances in which such principles have not been consistently observed in the current period in relation to the preceding period. #When the auditor determines that informative disclosures are not reasonably adequate, the auditor must so state in the auditor's report. #The auditor must either express an opinion regarding the financial statements, taken as a whole, or state that an opinion cannot be expressed, in the auditor's report. When the auditor cannot express an overall opinion, the auditor should state the reasons therefore in the auditor's report. In all cases where an auditor's name is associated with financial statements, the auditor should clearly indicate the character of the auditor's work, if any, and the degree of responsibility the auditor is taking, in the auditor's report == Clarity Project == In 2004, a project was begun to clarify and converge the standards with the International Standards in Auditing (ISAs). Many of the AU sections are being remapped as part of the Clarity Project.The AICPA‚Äôs Guide to Clarified and Converged Standards for Auditing and Quality Control. AICPA.

He has also worked extensively in music outside his band, from performing guest vocals on numerous songs to contributing to musical efforts with other rock bands such as Life of Agony, Another Animal, and Richards/Crane. ==Early life== Whitfield Crane was born on January 19, 1968 in Palo Alto, California as William Whitfield Crane. His father left the family when he was little. After his father's departure, Crane started to be interested in rock music.http://www.newrocktimes.com/news/2016/4/6/i-was-raised-by-rock-n-roll- says-whitfield-crane ==Work outside Ugly Kid Joe== During Ugly Kid Joe's inactivity, Crane went on a year-long tour with New York hard rock band Life of Agony before forming Medication with ex-Machine Head guitarist, Logan Mader. Due to a series of internal issues, Medication disbanded in February 2003. Over the years, Crane has performed guest vocals on several songs, including \\"Reaching Out\\" with Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray (from the Lynn Strait tribute album Strait Up), \\"Born to Raise Hell\\" by Mot√∂rhead (also featuring rapper Ice-T) and \\"Voodoo Brother\\" by Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest. Crane's filmography includes Ellie Parker, in which he has a cameo appearance as an acting student, and Mot√∂rhead's 25 & Alive Boneshaker, where he appears as himself. In 2006, former Ugly Kid Joe bandmate Shannon Larkin asked Crane to join a side project he formed with members of Godsmack (minus Sully Erna) called Another Animal, as primary vocalist. Crane accepted, and the band released its self-titled debut album in 2007. In support of their debut, the band went out on tour, opening for labelmates Alter Bridge. However, they have suffered poor record sales, and the future of the band is currently unknown. In 2011, he performed with metal tribute band Hail! in Istanbul, Turkey. He made regular appearances with Mot√∂rhead - the last being at the O2 Academy Glasgow on 9 November 2012 singing \\"Killed by Death\\". In 2016, Crane collaborated with Lee Richards, formerly of Godsmack, to form a band called Richards/Crane. The band released an album titled World Stands Still. ==Orchestra of Doom== On July 29, 2016 at the Teatro Ristori Theatre in Verona Italy, Whitfield Crane unveiled his new classical project Orchestra of Doom. Fronting the Machivelli 32 piece Orchestra, Crane sang classics by Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne as well as tracks from Ugly Kid Joe and his acoustic based project Richards/Crane.

He said that guitarist Glenn Tipton offered him and drummer Shannon Larkin the gig if they wanted it during the recording sessions of Tipton's solo album Baptizm of Fire. Crane explained that he couldn't accept the offer, \\"because you can't be Rob Halford. You can't be David Lee Roth. It'd be cool, and considering my love for Priest, which is immense, that would have been cool to do it, but not really. It's not a good move.

In most situations it is not advisable to dichotomize variables artificially. When a new variable is artificially dichotomized the new dichotomous variable may be conceptualized as having an underlying continuity. If this is the case, a biserial correlation would be the more appropriate calculation. The point-biserial correlation is mathematically equivalent to the Pearson (product moment) correlation, that is, if we have one continuously measured variable X and a dichotomous variable Y, rXY = rpb. This can be shown by assigning two distinct numerical values to the dichotomous variable. ==Calculation== To calculate rpb, assume that the dichotomous variable Y has the two values 0 and 1. If we divide the data set into two groups, group 1 which received the value \\"1\\" on Y and group 2 which received the value \\"0\\" on Y, then the point-biserial correlation coefficient is calculated as follows: : r_{pb} = \\\\frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_n} \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{n_1 n_0}{n^2}}, where sn is the standard deviation used when data are available for every member of the population: :s_n = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\\\overline{X})^2}\\\\,, M1 being the mean value on the continuous variable X for all data points in group 1, and M0 the mean value on the continuous variable X for all data points in group 2. Further, n1 is the number of data points in group 1, n0 is the number of data points in group 2 and n is the total sample size. This formula is a computational formula that has been derived from the formula for rXY in order to reduce steps in the calculation; it is easier to compute than rXY. There is an equivalent formula that uses sn‚àí1: : r_{pb} = \\\\frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_{n-1}} \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{n_1 n_0}{n(n-1)}}, where sn‚àí1 is the standard deviation used when data are available only for a sample of the population: :s_{n-1} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{n-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\\\overline{X})^2}. The version of the formula using sn‚àí1 is useful if one is calculating point-biserial correlation coefficients in a programming language or other development environment where there is a function available for calculating sn‚àí1, but no function available for calculating sn. Glass and Hopkins' book Statistical Methods in Education and Psychology, (3rd Edition) contains a correct version of point biserial formula. Also the square of the point biserial correlation coefficient can be written: : \\\\frac{ (M_1 - M_0)^2} {\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\\\overline{X})^2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{n_1 n_0}{n} \\\\right)\\\\,. We can test the null hypothesis that the correlation is zero in the population. A little algebra shows that the usual formula for assessing the significance of a correlation coefficient, when applied to rpb, is the same as the formula for an unpaired t-test and so : r_{pb} \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{n_1+n_0-2}{1-r_{pb}^2}} follows Student's t-distribution with (n1+n0 ‚àí 2) degrees of freedom when the null hypothesis is true. One disadvantage of the point biserial coefficient is that the further the distribution of Y is from 50/50, the more constrained will be the range of values which the coefficient can take. If X can be assumed to be normally distributed, a better descriptive index is given by the biserial coefficient : r_{b} = \\\\frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_n} \\\\frac{n_1 n_0}{n^2 u}, where u is the ordinate of the normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance at the point which divides the distribution into proportions n0/n and n1/n. This is not easy to calculate, and the biserial coefficient is not widely used in practice. A specific case of biserial correlation occurs where X is the sum of a number of dichotomous variables of which Y is one. An example of this is where X is a person's total score on a test composed of n dichotomously scored items. A statistic of interest (which is a discrimination index) is the correlation between responses to a given item and the corresponding total test scores. There are three computations in wide use, all called the point-biserial correlation: (i) the Pearson correlation between item scores and total test scores including the item scores, (ii) the Pearson correlation between item scores and total test scores excluding the item scores, and (iii) a correlation adjusted for the bias caused by the inclusion of item scores in the test scores. Correlation (iii) is : r_{upb}=\\\\frac{M_1-M_0-1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n^2s_n^2}{n_1n_0}-2(M_1-M_0)+1}}. A slightly different version of the point biserial coefficient is the rank biserial which occurs where the variable X consists of ranks while Y is dichotomous. We could calculate the coefficient in the same way as where X is continuous but it would have the same disadvantage that the range of values it can take on becomes more constrained as the distribution of Y becomes more unequal. To get round this, we note that the coefficient will have its largest value where the smallest ranks are all opposite the 0s and the largest ranks are opposite the 1s. Its smallest value occurs where the reverse is the case. These values are respectively plus and minus (n1 + n0)/2. We can therefore use the reciprocal of this value to rescale the difference between the observed mean ranks on to the interval from plus one to minus one. The result is : r_{rb} = 2\\\\frac{M_1 - M_0}{n_1+n_0}, where M1 and M0 are respectively the means of the ranks corresponding to the 1 and 0 scores of the dichotomous variable. This formula, which simplifies the calculation from the counting of agreements and inversions, is due to Gene V Glass (1966). It is possible to use this to test the null hypothesis of zero correlation in the population from which the sample was drawn. If rrb is calculated as above then the smaller of : (1+r_{rb})\\\\frac{n_1n_0}{2} and : (1-r_{rb})\\\\frac{n_1n_0}{2} is distributed as Mann‚ÄìWhitney U with sample sizes n1 and n0 when the null hypothesis is true. == Notes == ==External links== *Point Biserial Coefficient (Keith Calkins, 2005) Category:Covariance and correlation Category:Psychometrics ","title":"Point-biserial correlation coefficient"},{"id":"3257644","text":"This is a list of mayors of Nuremberg (Oberb√ºrgermeister der Stadt N√ºrnberg) since 1818: * 1818‚Äì1821: Christian Gottfried Lorsch * 1821‚Äì1853: Jakob Friedrich Binder * 1854‚Äì1867: Maximilian von Waechter * 1867‚Äì1891: Otto Freiherr von Stromer * 1892‚Äì1913: Georg Ritter von Schuh (FVP) * 1913‚Äì1919: Otto Ge√üler (FVP) * 1920‚Äì1933: Hermann Luppe (DDP) * 1933‚Äì1945: Willy Liebel (NSDAP) * 1945: Julius R√ºhm (NSDAP) * 1945: Martin Treu (SPD) * 1945‚Äì1948: Hans Ziegler (SPD) * 1948‚Äì1951: Otto Ziebill (SPD) * 1952‚Äì1957: Otto B√§rnreuther (SPD) * 1957‚Äì1987: Andreas Urschlechter (SPD) * 1987‚Äì1996: Peter Sch√∂nlein (SPD) * 1996‚Äì2002: Ludwig Scholz (CSU) * since 2002: Ulrich Maly (SPD) ==See also== * Timeline of Nuremberg * Nuremberg ","title":"List of mayors of Nuremberg"},{"id":"3257645","text":"Punch and Jewelee are supervillains in the DC Universe. They originally battled Captain Atom and Nightshade and later joined the Suicide Squad. ==Publication history== Punch and Jewelee first appeared in Captain Atom #85 and were created by Steve Ditko. Their first post-Crisis appearance in the DC universe was in Secret Origins #28. ==Fictional character biographies== The couple that is known as Punch and Jewelee are considered two of the silliest criminals active today by most superheroes. Most people consider them clowns and do not take them seriously, but discounting them is a mistake, since they are completely amoral individuals who act as much on whim as on any other motivation. This makes them quite unpredictable and dangerous. The couple grew up together in Brooklyn and went into business as puppeteers at Coney Island, moonlighting as thieves. One day, they found a small box containing alien weaponry left behind by careless extraterrestrials. They quickly learned how to use the weapons. Since they had always been puppeteers, they decided to adapt the characters of Punch and Judy to themselves. Calling themselves Punch and Jewelee, they began a brief criminal career along the East Coast. In the original stories prior to the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the duo battled Nightshade and Captain Atom. Following the Crisis, it was retconned to reveal that Nightshade's partner was King Faraday, and not Captain Atom. ===Suicide Squad=== Not long afterwards, Amanda Waller recruited Punch and Jewelee for a mission with the Suicide Squad, a team of \\"expendable\\" super-operatives. The demented duo went along with the Squad, but seemed more interested in entertaining each other with pure silliness than with the business at hand, and soon exhibited a disturbing propensity for violence. After their first outing with the Suicide Squad, Waller decided to keep Punch and Jewelee active with the group to observe their actions. The team was then thrust into the governmental upheaval called the Janus Directive, where Punch and Jewelee tried to pilfer property while working as Squad agents. To mission leader Bronze Tiger, it became obvious that while Punch and Jewelee had their skills and good points, they were a liability to the team. The two are some of the many agents/heroes sent into battle against Kobra, whose forces were threatening to kill uncounted millions of innocent citizens. They are seen working together to 'pop' random enemy soldiers. Jewelee soon learned she was pregnant, although for a brief time she was unsure who the child's father was since she did a great deal of flirting with Suicide Squad operative Captain Boomerang. Impending parenthood led Jewelee and Punch to agree that it was time to leave the Squad and settle down in suburbia, to live the Great American Dream as depicted in television sitcoms from the 1950s. ===Post Suicide Squad=== Punch and Jewelee were seen in Washington, D.C., where they turned up at a scientific demonstration with their baby (sex and name unknown) and swore to the public that they had reformed, yet they tried to steal an experimental force-field vest to protect their offspring. The vest failed and Punch was injured in an ensuing accident, driving the family back to their suburban home. Punch, Jewelee, and child are now residing somewhere in Middle America. They were part of the \\"Night of 1,000 Thieves\\" in which a thousand villains attacked Metropolis on Christmas Eve. When Superman stopped them, they complained that without the jewels they had stolen their child would have to go to \\"public kindergarten\\". They later answered an advertisement for superheroes to help guard Project Cadmus in Superboy's absence, disguised as the new Hawk and Dove. They were exposed by the then-reformed Heat Wave. ===One Year Later=== One Year Later, Punch and Jewelee were seen trying to steal paintings from an art museum. They are stopped by the Manhunter and Obsidian. Later in Checkmate #6, they are contacted by Mirror Master to reform the Suicide Squad as part of a plan to discredit Amanda Waller. They team with other villains, such as the Tattooed Man, Icicle, Javelin and Plastique. All worry that the Secret Society Of Supervillains, currently a protection group, would hear about their unsanctioned operation and interfere. Despite this, they travel through mirrors to Myanmar, to capture a sentient energy source. Punch is shot moments later by guards. It is later revealed that in order to raise his status with the Society, the Tattooed Man had leaked information of their operation and thus, the Society had warned the guards. In revenge, Mirror Master turns the Tattooed Man to glass. While the survivors discuss his fate, Jewelee shatters the Tattooed Man. Jewelee was later seen in the Wedding Special of Justice League of America where she is seen as a member of the Injustice League Unlimited. She is later seen in Salvation Run. During the events of Blackest Night, Punch's corpse is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.Suicide Squad #67 (January 2010) He is referred to by the name \\"Clyde Phillips\\". Jewelee makes an appearance at Harley Quinn's sleepover party in issue 3 of Harley Quinn's comic book series. She talks about Punch, her baby, and the Suicide Squad to Poison Ivy and Harley. ===DC Rebirth=== In the post- Flashpoint continuity, Jewelee is introduced as an inmate in Arkham Asylum, having been in a near-catatonic state since Punch disappeared two years ago. When Batman and Commissioner Gordon arrive to recruit Jewelee as part of Batman's new Suicide Squad, it's revealed that Punch had actually captured Gordon and stolen his identity. Batman reveals that Punch had been held captive by Bane for two years, and offers him a chance to join the Squad to help sneak into Santa Prisca.Batman (vol. 3) #9 ==Powers and abilities== Punch wears boots that allow him to walk on air, using much the same principle as the Trickster's air shoes. He also wields an alien gun that generates \\"sting strings\\", various beams of light that can cause bodily harm or control the actions of others. Punch uses the gun as a puppeteer, manipulating his victims. This weapon has an inexhaustible power supply. Jewelee carries a set of jewels that contain different properties. One is a \\"hypno jewel\\" that can create convincing illusions and light effects. Another jewel is capable of generating energy and force blasts. Neither Punch nor Jewelee use their hands or feet in combat, preferring their weapons or handy \\"props\\" for dangerous slapstick fighting. ==In other media== ===Television=== * Punch and Jewelee appear in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Menace of the Conqueror Caveman\\" with Punch voiced by Diedrich Bader and Jewelee voiced by Jane Singer. They made an attempt to rob a bank, only to be foiled by Batman. Booster Gold and Skeets arrive later and he gives them his card. ===Film=== * They appear in the DC Animated Movie Universe film Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay with Punch voiced by Trevor Devall and Jewelee voiced by Julie Nathanson. They appear in the opening of the film as members of Amanda Waller's Task Force X program, alongside Deadshot and Count Vertigo. Following the completion of the mission, which involved recovering a flash drive containing leaked information from Tobias Whale, a double-cross erupts as Vertigo attacks Deadshot and Jewelee kills Punch, revealing that she was working with Vertigo. However, Waller overhears the conversation through Deadshot's ear communicator and activates a switch which blows Vertigo's head off. Jewelee tearfully pleads for Deadshot not to let Waller kill her before Deadshot shoots her to spare her a more painful death. ==References== ==External links== *Jewelee (Pre- Crisis) at DCU Guide *Jewelee (Post-Crisis) at DCU Guide Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967 Category:Literary duos Category:Animated duos Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko Category:Fictional puppeteers Category:Charlton Comics characters ","title":"Punch and Jewelee"},{"id":"3257669","text":"Alan David Baddeley, is a British psychologist. He is known for his research on memory and for developing the three-component model of working memory. He is a professor of psychology at the University of York. == Biography == Baddeley was born in Leeds, Yorkshire on 23 March 1934.https://books.google.ca/books?id=uJFGAQAAIAAJ&q;=Alan+Baddeley+1934+leeds&dq;=Alan+Baddeley+1934+leeds&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjq2rDnt7DPAhVMzoMKHYRjAQcQ6AEIOTAF He lived there with his parents, Donald and Nellie Baddeley, until leaving for university. He decided to study psychology and was originally interested in psychoanalysis. Later he changed his focus to evidence-based psychology. In 1956, Baddeley went to the United States of America to continue his studies. After spending a year in America, he returned home. He then went to Cambridge, where he met and married Hilary Ann White. Baddeley and his wife have three sons. Baddeley has taught and conducted research at University of Sussex, University of Stirling, MRC Applied Psychology Unit, Churchill College, University of Cambridge, and University of Bristol. He is currently a professor of psychology at the University of York. ==Education== Baddeley attended the University College London from 1953 to 1956. He then obtained an MA from Princeton University's Department of Psychology in 1957. He earned a PhD from University of Cambridge in 1962. He has been awarded Honorary Doctorates by University of Essex in 1999,University of Essex, \\"Honorary Graduates\\" http://www.essex.ac.uk/honorary_graduates/hg/default.aspx#1999 retrieved March 2013 Plymouth University in 2000, and University of Bristol in 2019. ==Career and research== In 1974, working with Graham Hitch, Baddeley developed an influential model of working memory called Baddeley's model of working memory, which argues for the existence of multiple short-term memory stores and a separate interacting system for manipulating the content of these stores. There are three components of this model: the phonological loop, the central executive, and the visuospatial sketch pad. In 2000, Baddeley suggested adding a fourth component to his memory model called the episodic buffer.The model accounts for much of the empirical data on short-term retention and manipulation of information. His landmark study in 1975 on the capacity of short term memory showed that people remembered more short words than long words in a recall test. This was called the word length effect and it demonstrated that pronunciation time rather than number of items determines the capacity of verbal short-term memory.This study also found that when participants repeated an irrelevant sound while reading the words, the world length effect does not happen. Working with Barbara Wilson, Baddeley also did several important studies on amnesia and memory. They studied patients with temporal lobe damage that caused memory problems. Results of such studies provide evidence that short-term and long-term memory are not one system. The amnesia patients had normal short-term memory but impaired long-term memory. Baddeley has also done research studies using divers and various underwater conditions. He studied the effects of depth and pressure on dexterity, the impact of temperature on response time, and context-dependent memory on land and underwater. Baddeley was the director of the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, a branch of the UK Medical Research Council, based in Cambridge, from 1974 - 1997. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1993 and in 1996, was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2001, Baddeley received the American Psychological Association (APA) Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions. Baddeley was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the British Psychological Society in 2012. He also received the Major Advancement in Psychological Science Prize from the International Union of Psychological Science in 2016. ===Other notable works=== Baddeley has also part authored a number of neuropsychological tests including the Doors and People, Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (CN REP), the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI), Visual Patterns Test (VPT) and the Speed and Capacity of Language Processing Test (SCOLP). Baddeley was involved in the design of United Kingdom postcodes, and was one of the founders of the European Society for Cognitive Psychology. ==References== == External links == * Category:1934 births Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:British psychologists Category:Cognitive scientists Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Living people Category:Memory researchers Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Academics of the University of York ","title":"Alan Baddeley"},{"id":"3257712","text":"Green curry (, , , literally sweet green curry) is a central Thai variety of curry. ==Etymology== The name \\"green\\" curry derives from the color of the dish, which comes from green chillies. The \\"sweet\\" in the Thai name (wan means 'sweet') refers to the particular color green itself and not to the taste of the curry. As this is a Thai curry based on coconut milk and fresh green chillies, the color comes out creamy mild green or, as this color is called in Thai, \\"sweet green\\". Its ingredients are not exactly fixed. The curry is not necessarily sweeter than other Thai curries but, although the spiciness varies, it tends to be more pungent than the milder red curries.David Thompson, Thai Food (edition 2010), Pavilion Books, pages 218-220, Green curry evolved during the reign of King Rama VI or Rama VII, between the years 1908-1926. ==Ingredients== Apart from a main protein, traditionally fish, fish balls, or meat, the other ingredients for the dish consist of coconut milk, green curry paste, palm sugar, and fish sauce. Thai eggplant (aubergine), pea aubergine, basil leaves or other green or whitish vegetables and even fruit are often included.Andy Ricker, Pok Pok, Ten Speed Press Berkeley, 2013, pages 161-162, The consistency of its sauce varies with the amount of coconut milk used. Green curry paste is traditionally made by pounding in a mortar green chillies, shallots, garlic, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime peel, cilantro roots (coriander), and cumin seeds, white peppercorns, shrimp paste and salt. ==Cooking method== The paste is fried in split coconut cream until the oil is expressed to release the aromas in the paste. Once the curry paste is cooked, more coconut milk and the remaining ingredients are added along with a pinch of palm sugar and fish sauce. Finally, as garnishes, Thai basil, fresh kaffir lime leaves, sliced phrik chi faa (\\"sky-pointing chilies\\", large mild chilies) are often used. For a more robust green curry, such as with seafood, julienned krachai (fingerroot/wild ginger/Chinese keys), white turmeric, and holy basil can be used as garnishes. ==Serving== Green curry is typically eaten with rice as part of a wider range of dishes in a meal, or with round rice noodles known as khanom chin as a single dish. A thicker version of green curry made with, for instance, simmered beef, can also be served with roti, an Indian style flatbread that is similar to the roti canai in Malaysia.David Thompson, Youtube: Beef green curry with roti ==Gallery== File:Green curry ingredients.jpgIngredients for green curry paste File:Thai green curry paste.jpgFreshly made green curry paste in a mortar File:Khanom chin kaeng kiao wan kai.jpgGreen chicken feet curry served with khanom chin File:Khao phat kaeng khiao wan.jpgRice fried with green curry File:Green curry (42296614864).jpgGreen curry with meat ==See also== * Thai curry * Red curry ==References== ==External links== * Category:Thai curries ","title":"Green curry"},{"id":"3257714","text":"Jesus Loves You could refer to: * Jesus Loves You (band), a British band that included Boy George * \\"Jesus Loves You (But Not As Much As I Do)\\", a song by Eve's Plum from album Cherry Alive * \\"Jesus Loves You\\", a song by Jewel from her album This Way * \\"Jesus Loves You\\", a song by Christian pop punk band Stellar Kart from their album Expect the Impossible ==See also== *\\"Jesus Loves Me\\", a Christian hymn written by Anna Bartlett Warner ","title":"Jesus Loves You"},{"id":"3257715","text":"Bridget Riley, Bolt of Colour, 2017-2019 Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas Although women artists have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, has been often obfuscated, overlooked and undervalued. Many of their works have been wrongly attributed to men artists. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as textile or fiber arts, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories, such as ceramic art, in which both men and women participated. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like \\"arts and crafts\\", rather than fine art.Aktins, Robert. \\"Feminist art.\\" Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. 1997 (retrieved 23 Aug 2011) Women in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world. They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, feminist artists and art historians created a Feminist art movement that overtly addresses the role of women especially in the Western art world, how world art is perceived, evaluated or appropriated according to gender. Moreover, it explores the role of women in art history as in society. ==Prehistoric era== Bradshaw rock paintings found in the north-west Kimberley region of Western Australia There are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in Neolithic cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewellery. Collaboration on large projects was common if not typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the Paleolithic era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. Cave paintings of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.\\"Were the First Artists Mostly Women?\\" \\"National Geographic\\", October 9, 2013 ===Ceramic art=== There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the Nok in Africa over 3,000 years ago.Breunig, Peter. 2014.

Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese, Cretan, Greek, Persian, Mayan, Japanese, and Korean cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures.

In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations. There were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; Opus Anglicanum or English embroidery was already famous across Europe ‚Äì a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. ==== The Bayeux Tapestry ==== One of the most famous embroideries (it is not a tapestry) of the Medieval period is the Bayeux Tapestry, which was embroidered with wool on nine linen panels and is 230 feet long. Its c. seventy scenes narrate the Battle of Hastings and the Norman Conquest of England. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux states: === The High Middle Ages === In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the Tower of London, and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including Ende, a 10th-century Spanish nun; Guda, a 12th-century German nun; and Claricia, a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them. In many parts of Europe, with the Gregorian Reforms of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan Scandinavia (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female runemaster, Gunnborga, worked in the 11th century.Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff. Hildegard of Bingen Scivias I.6: The Choirs of Angels. From the Rupertsberg manuscript, fol. 38r. In Germany, however, under the Ottonian Dynasty, convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of Herrade of Landsberg and Hildegard of Bingen. Hildegard of Bingen (1098‚Äì1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote The Divine Works of a Simple Man, The Meritorious Life, sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, Scivias (Know the Ways of the Lord), which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the Scivias, as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegard experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at Bingen. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision. The 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The Wife of Bath in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan guilds. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating Opus Anglicanum, or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of Ma√Ætre Honor√© and the daughter of Jean le Noir. By the 13th century most illuminated manuscripts were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to printing, and book illustration to the printmaking techniques of woodcut and engraving, where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists. Meanwhile, Jefimija (1349-1405) a Serbian, noblewoman, widow and orthodox nun became known not only as a poet who wrote a lament for her dead son, Uglje≈°a, but also as a skilled needlewoman and engraver. Her lament for her beloved son which immortalized the sorrow of all mothers mourning their deceased children, was carved on the back of the diptych, (two-panelled icon representing a Virgin and Child) which Teodosije, Bishop of Serres, had presented as a gift to the infant Uglje≈°a at his baptism. The piece of art, already valuable because of the gold, precious stones, and beautiful carving on its wooden panels, became priceless after Jefemija's lament was engraved on its back. In 15th-century Venice the daughter of the glass artist, Angelo Barovi√®r, was known to have been the artist behind a particular glass design from Venetian Murano. She was Marietta Barovier, a Venetian glass artist. Seemingly several centuries had to elapse before women were able to pursue the medium in Glass art. ===Renaissance=== Levina Teerlinc, Portrait of Elizabeth I. c. 1565 File:Catherinebolognaart.jpgSt. Catherine of Bologna (Caterina dei Vigri), (Maria und das Jesuskind mit Frucht), c. 1440s.

The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift came from the Counter- Reformation reacting against Protestantism and giving rise to a move toward humanism, a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important. Significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, On Famous Women and The City of Women, illustrate this cultural change. Boccaccio, a 14th-century humanist, wrote De mulieribus claris (Latin for On Famous Women) (1335‚Äì59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of Thamar (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of On Famous Women, Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. Christine de Pizan, a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote Book of the City of Ladies in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as Anastasia, who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women. The most notable of these was Il Cortegiano or The Courtier by 16th-century Italian humanist Baldassare Castiglione. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. Sofonisba Anguissola was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters. The Cremona-born Anguissola was both a trailblazer and role model for future generations of women artists. Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as Lavinia Fontana and Caterina van Hemessen began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Fontana benefited from the enlightened attitudes in her native city, Bologna where the university had admitted women scholars since the Middle Ages. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the Academy, and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions. Although many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include Caterina dei Virgi, Antonia Uccello, and Suor Barbara Ragnoni. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter Lavinia Fontana, the miniature portraitist Levina Teerlinc, and the portrait painter Caterina van Hemessen. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the Guild of Saint Luke in Bruges show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators). ===Nelli's Last Supper=== The Last Supper, a 7x2-meter oil-on- canvas, preserved in the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, is the only signed work by Plautilla Nelli known to survive. A recently rediscovered fragile 22 foot canvas roll in Florence has turned out to be an outstanding treasure. But for the groundbreaking actions of American philanthropist, Jane Fortune (died 2018) and Florence-based author, Linda Falcone and their organisation, Advancing Women Artists Foundation, the roll might have gathered more dust. Four years of painstaking restoration by a female led team, reveals the brilliance of the 16th-century, self-taught, suor Plautilla Nelli, a nun, and only renaissance woman known to have painted the Last Supper.broadcast download available.

Luisa Rold√°n known as La Roldana, Rachel Ruysch, Maria Theresa van Thielen, Anna Maria van Thielen, Fran√ßoise-Catherina van Thielen and Elisabetta Sirani. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. Artemisia Gentileschi is an example of this. She was trained by her father, Orazio Gentileschi, and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. Luisa Rold√°n was trained in her father's (Pedro Rold√°n) sculpture workshop. Women artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as Elisabetta Sirani created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses. One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith beheading Holofernes, in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining and avenging her own destiny. Letizia Treves, curator at London's National Gallery 2020 Gentileschi show has commented: \\"you can't see it without thinking of Tassi raping Gentileschi.\\"Note: The Artemisia Gentileschi exhibition at the National Gallery, London scheduled for 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The elements of the picture are \\"balanced with such skill they speak of a painter who prioritised virtuosity over passion.\\" While other artists, including Botticelli and the more traditional woman, Fede Galizia, depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. Still life emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included Clara Peeters, a painter of banketje or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; Maria van Oosterwijk, the internationally renowned flower painter; and Rachel Ruysch, a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including Giovanna Garzoni, who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and Louise Moillon, whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors. ===18th century=== Angelica Kauffman, Literature and Painting, 1782, Kenwood House Anne Vallayer-Coster, Attributes of Music, 1770 Marie-Gabrielle Capet, 1783 Ignacy Potocki by Anna Rajecka, 1784 Image:Self-portrait_in_a_Straw_Hat_by_Elisabeth-Louise_Vig√©e- Lebrun.jpgElisabeth Vigee-Le Brun (1755‚Äì1842), Self-portrait, c. 1780s, one of many she painted for sale Image:Self-portrait holding a portrait of her sister, by Rosalba Carriera.jpgRosalba Carriera (1675‚Äì1757), Self-portrait 1715 File:Ulrica pasch.jpgUlrika Pasch, Self portrait, c. 1770 File:Anna Dorothea Therbusch 001.jpgAnna Dorothea Therbusch, Self-portrait, 1777 File:Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard - Self-Portrait with Two Pupils - The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpgAd√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard, Self-portrait with two pupils, Marie-Gabrielle Capet and Marie-Marguerite Carreaux de Rosemond 1785, Metropolitan Museum of Art File:Marguerite G√©rard - The first steps.jpgMarguerite G√©rard, First steps, oil on canvas, 45.5 x 55 cm, c. 1788 Artists from this period include, Rosalba Carriera, Maria Cosway, Marguerite G√©rard, Angelica Kauffman, Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard, Giulia Lama, Mary Moser, Ulrika Pasch, Ad√®le Romany, Anna Dorothea Therbusch, Anne Vallayer-Coster, Elisabeth Vig√©e-Le Brun and Anna Rajecka, also known as Madame Gault de Saint- Germain. In many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style. The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was history painting, especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, Peace Bringing Back Plenty, which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint. She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.Heller, Nancy G., Women Artists: An Illustrated History, Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 In England, two women, Angelica Kauffman and Mary Moser, were founding members of the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1768. Kauffmann helped Maria Cosway enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of The Academicians of the Royal Academy by Johan Zoffany now in The Royal Collection. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead. The emphasis in Academic art on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists. After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until Laura Knight in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as Jacques-Louis David and Jean-Baptiste Greuze. ==19th century== === Painters === Women artists of the early part of the 19th century include Marie-Denise Villers, who specialized in portraiture; Constance Mayer, who painted portraits and allegories; Marie Ellenrieder, who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the Nazarene style; Louise-Ad√©one Dr√∂lling, who followed in the footsteps of her father and her older brother as a painter and draughtswoman. In the second half of the century, Emma Sandys, Marie Spartali Stillman, Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale, and Maria ZambacoMaria Zambaco Retrieved June 15, 2010 were women artists of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were Evelyn De Morgan and the activist and painter Barbara Bodichon. Impressionist painters Berthe Morisot, Marie Bracquemond, and the Americans, Mary Cassatt and Lucy Bacon, became involved in the French Impressionist movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist Lilla Cabot Perry was influenced by her studies with Monet and by Japanese art in the late 19th century. Cecilia Beaux was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. Apart from Anna Bili≈Ñska- Bohdanowicz, Olga Bozna≈Ñska is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism. Rosa Bonheur was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals.Butler, Judith, Elizabeth Weed (2011). The Question of Gender: Joan W. Scott's Critical Feminism. Indiana University Press. p. 50. . Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the Government School, was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously Scotland Forever!, showing a cavalry charge at Waterloo. Kitty Lange Kielland was a Norwegian landscape painter. Elizabeth Jane Gardner was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the Paris Salon. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. In 1894, Suzanne Valadon was the first woman admitted to the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in France. Anna Boch was a post-impressionist painter, as was Laura Muntz Lyall, who exhibited at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, and then in 1894 as part of the Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais in Paris.

She was Eleanor Coade (1733 ‚Äì 1821). She became known for manufacturing Neoclassical statues, architectural decorations and garden ornaments made of Lithodipyra or Coade stone for over 50 years from 1769 until her death.Alison Kelly, \\"Eleanor Coade\\", Oxford National Dictionary of Biography Lithodipyra (\\"stone fired twice\\") was a high-quality, durable moulded weather-resistant, ceramic stoneware. Statues and decorative features from this ceramic still look almost new today. Coade did not invent 'artificial stone', but she likely perfected both the clay recipe and the firing process. She combined high-quality manufacturing and artistic taste, together with entrepreneurial, business and marketing skills, to create the overwhelmingly successful stone products of her age. She produced stoneware for St George's Chapel, Windsor, The Royal Pavilion, Brighton, Carlton House, London and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Eleanor Coade developed her own talent as a modeller, exhibiting around 30 sculptures on classical themes at the Society of Artists between 1773 and 1780 as listed in their exhibitors catalogue of the time.Miss Eleanor Coade, Sculptor in the exhibitors catalogue of the Society of Arts, London After her death, her Coade stoneware was used for refurbishments to Buckingham Palace and by noted sculptors in their monumental work, such as William Frederick Woodington's South Bank Lion (1837) on Westminster Bridge, London. The statue was made in separate parts and sealed together on an iron frame. The century produced its women sculptors in the East, Seiyodo Bunshojo (1764-1838) a Japanese netsuke carver and Haiku writer. She was Seiyodo Tomiharu's daughter.

The British Government School of Design, which later became the Royal College of Art, admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a \\"Female School\\" which was treated somewhat differently, with \\"life\\"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. The Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the Slade School of Art from the 1870s, were more liberal. By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called The Society of Women Artists) was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.\\"History\\", The Society of Women Artists.

Hilma af Klint (1862‚Äì1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic. Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh (1865‚Äì1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the \\"Glasgow Style\\" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 Vienna Secession, where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as Gustav Klimt. Annie Louisa Swynnerton (1844-1933) was a portrait, landscape and 'symbolist' artist, considered by her peers, such as John Singer Sargent and Edward Burne-Jones as one of the finest and most creative artists of her era, but was still not allowed access to mainstream art school training. She moved abroad to study at the Acad√©mie Julian and spent much of her life in France and Rome where the more liberal attitudes allowed her to express a broad range of compositional subjects. She was still not formally recognized in Britain until 1923 at the age of 76 when she became the first female admitted to the Royal Academy of Arts. Wilhelmina Weber Furlong (1878‚Äì1962) was an early American modernist in New York City. She made significant contributions to modern American art through her work at the Art Students League and the Whitney Studio Club.The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, , Professor Emeritus James K. Kettlewell: Harvard, Skidmore College, Curator, The Hyde Collection. Foreword to The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm: , Aleksandra Ekster and Lyubov Popova were Constructivist, Cubo-Futurist, and Suprematist artists well known and respected in Kiev, Moscow and Paris in the early 20th century. Among the other women artists prominent in the Russian avant-garde were Natalia Goncharova, Varvara Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova. Sonia Delaunay and her husband were the founders of Orphism. In the Art Deco era, Hildreth Meiere made large-scale mosaics and was the first woman honored with the Fine Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects. Tamara de Lempicka, also of this era, was an Art Deco painter from Poland. Sr. Maria Stanisia became a notable portraitist, mainly of clergy. Georgia O'Keeffe was born in the late 19th century. She became known for her paintings, featuring flowers, bones, and landscapes of New Mexico. In 1927, Dod Procter's painting Morning was voted Picture of the Year in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and bought by the Daily Mail for the Tate gallery. Its popularity resulted in its showing in New York and a two-year tour of Britain.\\"Dod Procter\\", Tate. Retrieved on 16 September 2009. Surrealism, an important artistic style in the 1920s and 1930s, had a number of prominent women artists, including Leonora Carrington, Kay Sage, Dorothea Tanning, and Remedios Varo. There were also outliers, such as the British self-taught, often comedic observer, Beryl Cook (1926-2008). Among East and Central European women artists, the following are noteworthy: Milein Cosman (1921-2017), Marie-Louise von Motesiczky (1906-1996), Else Meidner (1901-1987), Sanja Ivekoviƒá (born 1949), Orshi Drozdik (born 1946) ===Theatrical designers=== Women graphic artists and illustrators, like the rare female cartoonist, Claire Bret√©cher, have made a generous contribution to their field.Bret√©cher publications in Pilote, L'√âcho des Savanes and Spirou BDoubli√©es On a larger scale, among theatrical designers the following have been notable: Elizabeth Polunin, Doris Zinkeisen, Adele √Ñngg√•rd, Kathleen Ankers, Madeleine Arbour, Marta Becket, Maria Bj√∂rnson, Madeleine Boyd, Gladys Calthrop, Marie Anne Chiment, Millia Davenport, Kirsten Dehlholm, Victorina Dur√°n, Lauren Elder, Heidi Ettinger, Soutra Gilmour, Rachel Hauck, Marjorie B.

Dorothea Lange documented the Depression. Berenice Abbott created images of well known architecture and celebrity, Margaret Bourke-White created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first Life Magazine. Diane Arbus based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. Graciela Iturbide's works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while Tina Modotti produced \\"revolutionary icons\\" from Mexico in the 1920s.Lowe, Sarah M., Tina Modootti: Photographs, Harry N. Abrams Inc., Publishers, 1995 p. 36 Annie Leibovitz's photographic work was of rock and roll and other celebrity figures. Other women to break through the glass ceiling have included: Eve Arnold, Marilyn Silverstone and Inge Morath of Magnum, Daphne Zileri, Anya Teixeira, Elsa Thiemann, Sabine Weiss and Xyza Cruz Bacani. === Multi-Media === Hambling's Scallop 2003, tribute to Benjamin Britten, north end of Aldeburgh beach, England Magdalena Abakanowicz Europos parkas, Lithuania Mary Carroll Nelson founded the Society of Layerists in Multi-Media (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of Emil Bisttram and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as Morris Graves of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, Judy Chicago created The Dinner Party, a very important work of feminist art. Helen Frankenthaler was an Abstract Expressionist painter and she was influenced by Jackson Pollock. Lee Krasner was also an Abstract Expressionist artist and married to Pollock and a student of Hans Hofmann. Elaine de Kooning was a student and later the wife of Willem de Kooning, she was an abstract figurative painter. Anne Ryan was a collagist. Jane Frank, also a student of Hans Hofmann, worked with mixed media on canvas. In Canada, Marcelle Ferron was an exponent of automatism. From the 1960s on, feminism led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the art historians Germaine Greer, Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, curator Jasia Reichardt and others. Some art historians such as Daphne Haldin have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished. Figures like Artemisia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist icons. The Guerilla Girls, an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were \\"the conscience of the art world.\\" They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, Catherine de Zegher curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, Inside the Visible, that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring Claude Cahun, Louise Bourgeois, Bracha Ettinger, Agnes Martin, Carrie Mae Weems, Charlotte Salomon, Eva Hesse, Nancy Spero, Francesca Woodman, Lygia Clark, Mona Hatoum and the acclaimed Magdalena Abakanowicz who used textiles in her installations,Reichardt, Jasia.

Several influences contributed to the emergence of studio pottery: art pottery in the work of the Martin Brothers and William Moorcroft, the Arts and Crafts movement, the Bauhaus and the rediscovery of traditional artisan pottery and the excavation of large quantities of Song pottery in China. Leading trends in British studio pottery in the 20th century are represented by both men and women: Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Dora Billington, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper. Leach (1887‚Äì1979) established a style of pottery, the ethical pot, strongly influenced by Chinese, Korean, Japanese and medieval English forms. His style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th century. Leach's influence was disseminated in particular by his A Potter's BookLeach, Bernard. A Potter‚Äôs Book, Faber and Faber, 1988. and the apprentice system he ran at his pottery in St Ives, Cornwall. Other ceramic artists exerted an influence through their positions in art schools. Dora Billington (1890‚Äì1968) studied at Hanley School of Art, worked in the pottery industry and became head of pottery at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She worked in media that Leach did not, e.g. tin-glazed earthenware, and influenced potters such as William Newland, Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie and Margaret Hine.Oliver Watson, Studio Pottery, London: Phaidon Press, 1993Julian Stair, \\"Dora Billington\\", Crafts, 154, September/October 1998 Since the 1960s, a new generation of potters, influenced by the Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design including, Alison Britton, Ruth Duckworth and Elizabeth Fritsch who began to experiment\\\\abstract ceramic objects, varied surface and glaze effects to critical acclaim. Elizabeth Fritsch has work represented in major collections and museums worldwide. Moreover, the reputation of British ceramisists has attracted talent from around the world and released notable artists in the field. They include: Indian Nirmala Patwardhan, Kenyan, Magdalene Odundo and Iranian, Homa Vafaie Farley. As in Britain, pottery was integral to the United States Arts and Crafts movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Charles Fergus Binns, who was the first director of the New York State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics at Alfred University, was an important influence. Some potters in the United States adopted the approach from emerging studio pottery movements in Britain and Japan. Worldwide and European artists coming to the United States have contributed to the public appreciation of ceramics as art, and included Marguerite Wildenhain, Maija Grotell, Susi Singer and Gertrude and Otto Natzler. Significant studio potters in the United States include Otto and Vivika Heino, Beatrice Wood and Amber Aguirre. Meanwhile, in the reducing primeval forests of the African Great Lakes region in the Rift Valley, there is a people clinging to their foraging ancestral way of life. They are the Batwa, among the most marginalised people in the world, whose womenfolk (and the occasional man) continue the centuries-old custom of making pottery which has been used as barter with the peasants and pastoralists of the region. Their pots range from plain to highly decorated.

Gillian Wearing won the prize in 1997, when there was an all- woman shortlist, the other nominees being Christine Borland, Angela Bulloch and Cornelia Parker. In 1999, Tracey Emin gained considerable media coverage for her entry My Bed, but did not win. In 2006 the prize was awarded to abstract painter, Tomma Abts. In 2001, a conference called \\"Women Artists at the Millennium\\" was organized at Princeton University. A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as Linda Nochlin analysing prominent women artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Yvonne Rainer, Bracha Ettinger, Sally Mann, Eva Hesse, Rachel Whiteread and Rosemarie Trockel. Internationally prominent contemporary artists who are women also include Magdalena Abakanowicz, Marina Abramoviƒá, Jaroslava Brychtova, Lynda Benglis, Lee Bul, Sophie Calle, Janet Cardiff, Li Chevalier, Marlene Dumas, Orshi Drozdik, Marisol Escobar, Jenny Holzer, Runa Islam, Chantal Joffe, Yayoi Kusama, Karen Kilimnik, Sarah Lucas, Yoko Ono, Tanja Ostojiƒá, Jenny Saville, Carolee Schneeman, Cindy Sherman, Shazia Sikander, Lorna Simpson, Lisa Steele, Stella Vine, Kara Walker, Rebecca Warren, Bettina Werner and Susan Dorothea White. Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama's paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an \\"obsessive artist\\". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting No. 2 for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist. During 2010‚Äì2011, Pompidou Centre in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named elles@Centrepompidou. The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw Eileen Cooper elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame Elizabeth Blackadder in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982. An interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art. As of December 2013, the Women Environmental Artists Directory listed 307 women environmental artists, such as Marina DeBris, Vernita Nemec and Betty Beaumont. DeBris uses beach trash to raise awareness of beach and ocean pollution. and to educate children about beach trash. Nemec recently used junk mail to demonstrate the complexity of modern life. Beaumont has been described as a pioneer of environmental art and uses art to challenge our beliefs and actions.

Marie-Denise Villers, Young Woman Drawing 1801, Metropolitan Museum of Art Women artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era. There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including: * Scarcity of biographical information *Anonymity ‚Äì Women artists were often most active in artistic expressions that were not typically signed. During the Early Medieval period, manuscript illumination was a pursuit of monks and nuns alike.Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent , Jeffrey F. Hamburger, University of California Press * Painters' Guilds ‚Äì In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, many women worked in the workshop system. These women worked under the auspices of a male workshop head, very often the artist's father. Until the twelfth century there is no record of a workshop headed by a woman, when a widow would be allowed to assume her husband's former position. Often guild rules forbade women from attaining the various ranks leading to master,Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution , Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 2008, , p. 49Dutch Painting 1600‚Äì1800 Pelican history of art, , Yale University Press, p.129 so they remained \\"unofficial\\" in their status. * Naming Conventions ‚Äì the convention whereby women take their husbands' last names impedes research on female articles, especially in cases in which a work of unknown origin was signed only with a first initial and last name. Even the simplest biographical statements may be misleading. For example, one might say that Jane Frank was born in 1918, but in reality she was Jane Schenthal at birth ‚Äì Jane \\"Frank\\" didn't exist until over twenty years later.Stanton, Phoebe B., \\"The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank\\" World Cat (A.S. Barnes: South Brunswick, New Jersey, and New York, 1968) [A second edition of this book was published in July 1969 (Yoseloff: London, ; also .] Examples like this create a discontinuity of identity for women artists. * Mistaken identity and incorrect attribution ‚Äì In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, work by women was often reassigned. Some unscrupulous dealers even went so far as to alter signatures, as in the case of some paintings by Judith Leyster (1630) that were reassigned to Frans Hals.Hofstede de Groot, Cornelis. \\"Judith Leyster,\\" Jahrbuch der K√∂niglich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen vol. 14 (1893), pp. 190‚Äì198; 232.Hofrichter, Frima Fox. \\"Judith Leyster: Leading Star,\\" Judith Leyster: A Dutch Master and Her World, (Yale University, 1993).Molenaer, Judith. \\"Leyster, Judith, Dutch, 1609‚Äì1660,\\" National Gallery of Art website. Accessed Feb. 1, 2014. Marie-Denise Villers (1774‚Äì1821) was a French painter who specialized in portraits. Villers was a student of the French painter Girodet. Villers' most famous painting, Young Woman Drawing, (1801) is displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The painting was attributed to Jacques-Louis David at one time, but was later realized to be Villers' work. ==Women in Outsider art== Anna Zem√°nkov√°, Untitled, 1960s Helen Martins, the Owl House. The concept of outsider art arose in the 20th- century when mainstream practitioners, collectors and critics began to consider the artistic expression of people without a conventional training. Among them would be, the self-taught, children, folk artists from around the world and inmates of mental institutions. Among the first to study this huge and mainly uncharted art space were members of the Blaue Reiter group in Germany, followed later by the French artist, Jean Dubuffet. Some of the noted women considered as exponents of \\"art brut\\", the French expression for outsider art, are: *Holly Farrell, 21st century Canadian self taught artist whose paintings include the Barbie & Ken series, is considered an Outsider artist. *Madge Gill (1882‚Äì1961) was an English mediumistic artist who made thousands of drawings \\"guided\\" by a spirit she called \\"Myrninerest\\" (my inner rest). *Annie Hooper (1897‚Äì1986), a sculptor of visionary religious art from Buxton, North Carolina, who created nearly 5,000 sculptures depicting biblical scenes. Her work is now in the permanent collection of North Carolina State University. *Georgiana Houghton (1814‚Äì1884), a British spiritualist medium, known for her visionary 'spirit drawings', consisting of intricate abstract watercolours. *Mollie Jenson (1890‚Äì1973) created a series of large-scale concrete sculptures embellished with tile mosaics in River Falls, Wisconsin. *Susan Te Kahurangi King (born 1951) is a New Zealand artist whose ability to speak declined by the age of four and stopped speaking altogether by age eight. King is an autistic savant who has methodically created an entire analogous world through extraordinary drawings using pen, graphite, colored pencil, crayon and ink. She drew prolifically through to the early 1990s and then without reason suddenly stopped. King renewed drawing in 2008 during filming of a documentary on her artwork. *Halina Korn (1902-1978) was a Pole of Jewish descent who settled in London during World War II. She was originally a writer who married the artist, Marek ≈ªu≈Çawski, and took up sculpture and painting in mid-life. She painted the everyday and exhibited in England, Scotland, the US and Poland. *Maud Lewis (1903‚Äì1970) was a Canadian folk artist. Lewis painted bright scenes of rural Nova Scotian life on found objects, including boards, construction materials, etc. *Helen Martins (1897‚Äì1976) transformed the house she inherited from her parents in Nieu- Bethesda, South Africa, into a fantastical environment decorated with crushed glass and cement sculptures. The house is known as The Owl House. *Grandma Moses (1860‚Äì1961), widely considered to be a painter of Folk art. *Judith Scott (1943‚Äì2005) was born deaf and with Down syndrome. After being institutionalized for 35 years she attended Creative Growth Art Center (a center for artists with disabilities in Oakland, California) and went on to become an internationally renowned fiber art sculptor. *Anna Zem√°nkov√° (1908‚Äì1986) was a self-taught Czech painter, draftsman and pastel artist. Her work was featured in a group show at London's Hayward Gallery in 1979, and eighteen of her pieces were shown at the Venice Biennale in 2013.Anna Zem√°nkov√°, The Good Luck Gallery, Los Angeles ==See also== * Advancing Women Artists Foundation * Women in Animation * Lists of women artists * List of 20th-century women artists * List of female sculptors * Australian feminist art timeline * Beaver Hall Group * Bonn Women's Museum * Female comics creators * Guerrilla Girls On Tour * National Museum of Women in the Arts * Native American women in the arts * Women Environmental Artists Directory * Women in photography * Women's International Art Club * Women surrealists * Women's Studio Workshop * The Story of Women and Art, 2014 television documentary ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Altmann, Suzanne. et al.

American football is one of the many traditions in American culture that is associated with Thanksgiving Day. Virtually every level of football, from amateur and high school to college and the NFL (including the CFL on Canadian Thanksgiving), plays football on Thanksgiving Day (Thursday) or the immediately following holiday weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). ==Early days== Thanksgiving Day football games in the United States are nearly as old as the game‚Äîand the organized holiday‚Äîthemselves. The first Thanksgiving Day football game took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day of 1869, less than two weeks after Rutgers defeated Princeton in New Brunswick, New Jersey in what is widely recognized as the first intercollegiate football game in the United States, and only six years after Abraham Lincoln declared the first fixed national Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. On November 17, 1869, the Evening Telegraph newspaper of Philadelphia published the following announcement: \\"Foot Ball: A foot-ball match between twenty-two players of the Young America Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club will take place on Thanksgiving Day at 12 1/2 o'clock, on the grounds of the Germantown Club.\\" The proximity of Philadelphia to both Rutgers and Princeton invites speculation that this game may have been played under similar rules and perhaps involved some of the same participants, or at least people familiar with the game played at Rutgers, and a second match at Princeton, earlier that month. Princeton played Yale in the New York City area on Thanksgiving Day from 1876 through 1881. The Thanksgiving Day football game became an institutionalized fixture of organized football in 1882, when the Intercollegiate Football Association determined to hold an annual collegiate championship game in New York City on Thanksgiving Day between the two leading teams in the association. Previously, the 'Champion' was to be determined by a team's records over the entire season against all members of the association. For at least the three previous years, the championship had been a matter of dispute as a result of Yale and Princeton playing to scoreless ties on three Thanksgiving Day games in a row. On November 25, 1897, American students of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and the Acad√©mie Julian played a game in Paris, France. This is considered the first American football game ever played in Europe. The introduction of Thanksgiving football is credited with encouraging the Southern United States, which had historically rejected the celebration of Thanksgiving, to embrace the holiday. Robert Tracy McKenzie, a history professor at Wheaton College, remarked: \\"I joke‚Äîbut also sort of mean it seriously‚Äîthat one of the things that ultimately reconciles Southerners to Thanksgiving is the development of football (...) and well before 1900, the tradition of having football games on Thanksgiving Day is sweeping across the country. And Southerners find out that the holiday isn‚Äôt that bad after all.\\" The tradition of playing football games on Thanksgiving continues to this day. At the high school level, the tradition is declining rapidly as schools drop their Thanksgiving games and shorten their regular season in favor of playoff tournaments and allowing players to focus on winter sports such as basketball. ==High school football== High school football games played on Thanksgiving are often called a Turkey Day Game or a Turkey Bowl (not to be confused with Turkey bowling), as Americans typically eat turkeys on Thanksgiving, although the title varies with each game. Most commonly these games are between high school football rivalries although in many cases, when poor weather requires a shorter season, the game can be the culmination of league play among a high- school league, in which the winners of this game will be the league champions for the year. (Statewide playoffs were generally rare until the 1970s and 1980s, which allowed for longer regular seasons.) The custom dates back more than 100 years and is particularly prevalent in the Northeast. In most cases, games are contested with kickoff times as early as 9 a.m., allowing the participants to have the rest of the holiday off. This list is sorted alphabetically, first by state, and then by school, with team leading the series listed first wherever possible. State and regional championship tournaments are listed ahead of rivalries. If the rivalry involves two states, the rivalry is listed under the school whose state comes first alphabetically (e.g. a New Jersey-Pennsylvania rivalry is listed under New Jersey). ===California=== ;San Jose Big Bone Game: The only Thanksgiving high school rivalry game to be played west of the state of Missouri, this game dates to 1943 and is played in San Jose, California each Thanksgiving at 11 am. The game pits Abraham Lincoln High School against San Jose High School. The \\"Big Bone\\" in question is the femur of a cow that was retrieved from a butcher shop. Lincoln leads the series 38‚Äì24. The game is preceded the week prior with the \\"Little Bone Game\\", played between the two junior varsity teams. The game has been lopsided in recent years, with Lincoln on an active 22-game winning streak through 2019. ;San Francisco Turkey Bowl: Also in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Turkey Bowl in San Francisco dates back to 1924 and currently is played at Kezar Stadium each Thanksgiving at 11 am. The Turkey Bowl is the city's public high school championship game. Galileo High School has the most overall wins in the game (16) after breaking Lincoln High School's record four-game winning streak in 2009.Drumwright, Steve (November 27, 2008).

The game is now played at M&T; Bank Stadium, in downtown Baltimore the first week of November. Anderson (City) and Baltimore attorney Warren Brown (Poly) have kept the Turkey Day tradition alive between the two schools by sponsoring a flag football game at 9 am every Thanksgiving morning at Baltimore's Herring Run Park.

Since 1942 Mount St. Michael and Cardinal Hayes have met on each Thanksgiving Day a storied CHSFL rivalry showdown. ;Iona Prep vs. New Rochelle (abolished): Played on Thanksgiving from 1949 to 2002, this rivalry contest was televised on New York City television, first by WABC-TV, then WPIX. As with the White Plains contest, New Rochelle's advancing to the state championship in 2003 and 2004 was the primary reason for the contest's abolition. *Yonkers vs. Gorton (abolished): The two schools were the first to play on Thanksgiving in Westchester County from the mid-1920s until 1984. *Roosevelt vs. Saunders (abolished): Another matchup in the city of Yonkers also took place from the mid-1920s to 1984.

As of 2013, Abington holds the lead, 54-33-6.Cheltenham Abington scores Cheltenham Abington 2013 ;Catasauqua vs. Northampton: Catasauqua High School and Northampton High School play a non-league game against each other every Thanksgiving dating back to 1925. The two schools are no longer within the same league, and thus the game is not sanctioned and does not count as a win/loss for official standings with regard to playoff consideration within the PIAA. The game is always considered to be Homecoming for Catasauqua, regardless of whether the game is played at home or away from their perspective. ;Chichester vs. Sun Valley: These two high schools from Delaware County have played each other a total of 83 times, and now the rivals face each other every Thanksgiving. Sun Valley narrowly has more wins than Chichester as the series record is currently 42‚Äì41. Sun Valley has won the past three years. ;East Stroudsburg vs. Stroudsburg: East Stroudsburg South High School (formerly East Stroudsburg High School) and Stroudsburg High School have been playing annually since 1945 and began their Turkey Day tradition in 1953. With the advent of district playoffs, the game was moved to the regular season for four years, then the schools agreed to play once during the season and again on Thanksgiving if neither team is in the playoffs.

The game has not been played on Thanksgiving since 1975 and the two schools have not met at all since 1993. Discussions between the two schools are in the works to renew this rivalry. ;Northeast vs. Central: This game pits two schools from the city of Philadelphia, Northeast High School and Central High School, against each other; the rivalry dates to 1892. The Central Lancers won the most recent Thanksgiving game (2013) by defeating the Northeast Vikings 6‚Äì3 in overtime. The Vikings hold a narrow all-time edge on the Lancers, 56‚Äì52‚Äì10. ;Archbishop Ryan vs. George Washington High School: This game is a Northeast Philadelphia classic which pits the Ryan Raiders against the Washington Eagles.

The imposition of a state championship tournament, coupled with the federally-ordered closure of Newport News High School for the purpose of desegregation, brought an end to the rivalry.Turkey Day game showcased great high school football rivalries. Daily Press. Retrieved April 21, 2014. Woodberry Forest vs. Episcopal The longest-running high school football rivalry in the South takes place each year between Woodberry Forest and Episcopal High School of Alexandria, Virginia. The schools first played against each other in 1901 and have competed in over a hundred consecutive games. \\"The Game\\", as it is known, draws back many alumni and is considered the homecoming game for both schools. The 100th contest, which Woodberry won, took place in 2000, drew nearly 15,000 spectators, and was featured on ESPN. ==\\"Turkey Bowl\\" games== An informal \\"Turkey Bowl\\" game in Redmond, Washington Unorganized groups have also been known to partake in American football on Thanksgiving. These informal matches are usually known as a Turkey Bowl (not to be confused with some high school football games that also use the name \\"Turkey Bowl\\", see above, and with Turkey Bowling). These games are usually unofficiated with a flag football, street football, or touch football format. While the games themselves are not generally nationally known, Turkey Bowls hold importance for those who participate and it is not uncommon for rivalries to last for decades. Turkey Bowls are played by a variety of people including extended families, college fraternities, volunteer fire departments, and local churches across the country which use the day and the game to have fun, exercise and renew old acquaintances. ==College football== Thanksgiving weekend historically marks the end of the college football regular season, before conference championships and bowl games begin play in December (the Army‚ÄìNavy Game is the lone exception). Today, this is only true for the top- level NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, where it has become a tradition to play a fierce rival on the last week of the regular season. At levels below the Bowl Subdivision, the NCAA begins its championship tournaments either on Thanksgiving weekend (for the Division I FCS championship) or the week before (in the cases of Divisions II and III; the NAIA, a separate body, also begins its tournament at that time). Other college football sanctioning bodies end their seasons well before Thanksgiving. The University of Kansas and University of Missouri played the first of nineteen consecutive Thanksgiving Day football games in Kansas City, Missouri in 1892. After new conference rules that required all games to be played on college campuses, the Thanksgiving Day tradition was temporarily suspended in 1911, but then reinstituted in spurts starting in 1916 and continuing through the 1940s. The University of Michigan made it a tradition to play annual Thanksgiving games, holding 19 such games from 1885 to 1905. The Thanksgiving Day games between Michigan and the Chicago Maroons in the 1890s have been erroneously cited as \\"The Beginning of Thanksgiving Day Football.\\" Since the Maroons no longer play at the Division I level, the Wolverines now play their modern-day archrivals, the Ohio State Buckeyes, during Thanksgiving weekend. Yale and Princeton began an annual tradition of playing against each other on Thanksgiving Day starting in 1876. From 1945 to 1956, the Burley Bowl pitted two small colleges against each other in an unofficial bowl game. From 1894 to 1953, Case Tech Rough Riders and Western Reserve University Red Cats played each other on Thanksgiving, playing at Cleveland Stadium. The two schools merged in 1970. The Turkey Day Classic, a college football game between Alabama State University and Tuskegee University, has been played on Thanksgiving Day annually from 1924 to 2012 and again since 2016; as such, it has historically been known as the \\"Turkey Day Classic.\\" It is also the oldest black college football classic, since the two colleges first played each other in 1901. Tuskegee University pulled out of the contest after 2012 (they were replaced by Stillman College in the 2013 contest), and Alabama State did the same from 2013 to 2015, deciding to move its homecoming to the Saturday before Thanksgiving; in both cases, the NCAA football tournaments prompted the schools to move the end of their seasons to before Thanksgiving so that they would be able to compete for the national championship should they qualify. The establishment of the Celebration Bowl for historically black schools allowed the Turkey Day Classic to resume; it was held against conference rivals Mississippi Valley State and Prairie View A&M; in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Another popular black college football classic played on Thanksgiving weekend is the Bayou Classic between Grambling State University and Southern University, which is held the Saturday after Thanksgiving; for the 2017 season only, because of a hurricane earlier in the season, the Labor Day Classic between Texas Southern and Prairie View A&M; was played on Thanksgiving weekend, and the two teams voluntarily agreed to hold that Classic on the same weekend in 2018. Alabama State, Mississippi Valley State, Prairie View A&M;, Texas Southern, Southern and Grambling are all members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. Other prominent college football rivalries that take place over Thanksgiving weekend include: *Auburn Tigers vs. Alabama Crimson Tide (the Iron Bowl) *Ole Miss Rebels vs. Mississippi State Bulldogs (the Battle of the Golden Egg, played on Thanksgiving night from 1998 to 2003 and 2017 to 2019) *LSU Tigers vs. Arkansas Razorbacks (the Battle for the Golden Boot), through 2013 **Arkansas has played Missouri on Thanksgiving weekend since 2014. *Georgia Bulldogs vs. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate) * BYU Cougars vs. Utah Utes (the Holy War, to 2010, again in 2018) *Colorado Buffaloes vs. Nebraska Cornhuskers (Colorado‚ÄìNebraska rivalry, through 2010) **Colorado Buffaloes vs. Utah Utes (Rumble in the Rockies, since 2011) **Nebraska Cornhuskers vs. Iowa Hawkeyes (Heroes Game, since 2011) * Oklahoma Sooners vs. Oklahoma State Cowboys (the Bedlam Series through 2016) ** This game was played earlier in the season in 2017 and 2018 *Texas Longhorns vs. Texas A&M; Aggies (the Lone Star Showdown, played on Thanksgiving from 2008 until its end in 2011, also played on Thanksgiving many other times prior to 2008) **Until 2015, Texas hosted a game on Thanksgiving night every year; after the end of the Lone Star Showdown, Texas played against TCU (for the Chancellor's Spurs) in even-numbered years and against Texas Tech in odd-numbered years. **Texas A&M; plays LSU during Thanksgiving week beginning in 2014, with the game being played on Thanksgiving night in 2014 and 2016. (see also: LSU‚ÄìTexas A&M; football rivalry) *Florida Gators vs. Florida State Seminoles (the Sunshine Showdown) *Notre Dame Fighting Irish vs. USC Trojans (the Jeweled Shillelagh); rivalry is played every year but only scheduled for Thanksgiving weekend when Southern Cal hosts; Southern Cal has hosted on Thanksgiving in even-numbered years since the 1960s. In odd-numbered years, USC typically plays UCLA, while Notre Dame typically plays Stanford. *Clemson Tigers vs. South Carolina Gamecocks (the Palmetto Bowl) *Virginia Tech Hokies vs. Virginia Cavaliers (the Commonwealth Cup, erratically scheduled) *Kentucky Wildcats vs. Tennessee Volunteers (historically the Battle for the Bourbon Barrel; played annually but no longer on Thanksgiving weekend) *Kentucky Wildcats vs. Louisville Cardinals (the Governor's Cup, moved to Thanksgiving weekend starting in 2014) *University of South Florida vs. University of Central Florida (the War on I-4) *Michigan Wolverines vs. Ohio State Buckeyes (The Game), played the Saturday after Thanksgiving. *Arizona vs. Arizona State (Duel in the Desert), played the Friday or Saturday after Thanksgiving. *Minnesota Golden Gophers vs. Wisconsin Badgers (Paul Bunyan's Axe) *North Carolina Tar Heels vs. NC State Wolfpack (North Carolina‚ÄìNC State football rivalry) *West Point Cadets vs. Naval Academy Midshipmen (the Army‚ÄìNavy Game; by 2006, it had moved one week, then eventually two weeks after Thanksgiving weekend beginning in 2009, to maintain its status as the last game of the college football regular season) The frequent changing of conferences stemming from the early-2010s realignment of NCAA teams and conferences complicated the numerous rivalries that traditionally play Thanksgiving weekend. While collegiate games have been played on Thanksgiving Day itself (with perhaps the most notable being the Nebraska-Oklahoma game of 1971), the majority of the current traditional Thanksgiving weekend college football games listed above are played on the Friday or Saturday after the holiday, in part to avoid conflicts with the NFL. Texas, as previously mentioned, has had more or less of a permanent spot on the night of the holiday itself since at least 2008.\\"College Football Thanksgiving Day and Weekend Schedule for 2010\\" Midwest Sports Fans from November 8, 2010 ==Professional football== Professional football teams and leagues have played on Thanksgiving from the start, with pro leagues and teams having played on Thanksgiving since the 1890s. It carried over when Buffalo and Rochester, two members of the New York Pro Football League which had held its championship on Thanksgiving 1919, and the Ohio League, which traditionally held its marquee matchups on Thanksgiving, combined into the NFL upon its founding in 1920, and as such, the NFL has played on Thanksgiving ever since. The Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys have played home games on Thanksgiving since 1934 and 1966, respectively, in a traditional series of NFL games. Beginning in 2006, the NFL added a third game on Thanksgiving night with a rotating host team.Thanksgiving games official page at NFL.com. Retrieved July 21, 2011. The rival American Football League also played on Thanksgiving in the 1960s, as did the All-America Football Conference in the 1940s and the original AFL in 1926. In the Canadian Football League, where games are played on Canadian Thanksgiving, the CFL hosts two games in the Thanksgiving Day Classic; it is one of only two weeks each year in which the CFL plays on a Monday, the other being the Labour Day Classic. The difference between the Thanksgiving and Labour Day games is that the Thanksgiving Day games do not have the same matchups each year; however, like its American counterpart, one of the games has a regular host (in the CFL's case, the Montreal Alouettes). Coincidentally, both the Grey Cup, the CFL's championship game, and the Vanier Cup, the championship of Canadian college football, are both traditionally played on the fourth weekend in November, which amounts to the week before or the week after American Thanksgiving. The World Football League originally planned to hold its 1974 championship game, World Bowl 1, the day after Thanksgiving in 1974; the business failures of the 1974 season led to the league reorganizing the playoff structure and pushing the World Bowl one week back (although the WFL regularly played on Thursdays during the regular season, it instead split its semifinals between the day before Thanksgiving and the day after). Had the United States Football League completed its move to autumn for the 1986 season, it would have played one of its games on Thanksgiving (a game featuring the Tampa Bay Bandits at the Memphis Showboats was scheduled for that night), but the league suspended operations prior to the season and, even if it had survived, the Bandits went bankrupt before the season would have been played. Similarly, the United Football League, which began play in 2009, held its first two UFL Championship Games over Thanksgiving weekend; both the truncated 2011 UFL season and the 2012 UFL season were cut short well before the Thanksgiving holiday due to financial shortfalls. The Fall Experimental Football League had scheduled its championship for the day before Thanksgiving Day 2014, in Brooklyn, but the game was cancelled after the season was shortened. ==References== ==External links== *Webster Groves ‚Äì Kirkwood Turkey Day Game Info *Annual Grand Junction Pizza Turkey Day Game - Since 1980 - Dallas, Texas *The Turkey Bowl ‚Äì Cleveland, Ohio *Rancho Romero Turkey Bowl ‚Äì Alamo, California *\\"Beyond Friday Night Lights\\" ‚Äì SportsShooter.com *\\"Rivalry on Thanksgiving menu in Maine\\" ‚Äì ESPNrise.com Category:History of American football Category:NFL on Thanksgiving Day Category:Thanksgiving (United States) ","title":"American football on Thanksgiving"},{"id":"3257729","text":"Roderick Rashaun Cartwright (born December 3, 1979) is a former American football running back in the National Football League (NFL).

Stevens was a wrestling superstar since the early years of the television era until he retired during the early 1990s. His performances and hard bumping style inspired generations of villain wrestlers who have attempted to emulate his ability to provide high quality and heat generating matches that continuously bring in huge crowds of fans. He was well known for using two different finishing moves in his many victories: the \\"Bombs Away\\" knee drop (a diving knee drop from the top rope to the throat) and the piledriver. Stevens wrestled as both a singles performer and in tag team matches with a variety of partners. In 2006, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. ==Professional wrestling career== ===Early career=== Stevens began his four decade-long career in 1950 at the age of 15. One of Stevens's mentors was the \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion. When commenting on the ability of his longtime friend, Rogers consistently said \\"Ray was one of the most talented and graceful wrestlers I've ever watched and been a part of. He won titles at the youngest age of any wrestler I've ever known and was a credit to the game\\" (Page 3 of Whatever Happened To...?, Issue Number Twenty One, May 1996). Throughout most of his working years, Stevens was a villain. He occasionally turned into a face. His most famous finishing move was the \\"Bombs Away\\" knee drop which involved Ray \\"the Blond Bomber\\" jumping off the top turnbuckle and landing with his knee on the throat of his opponent. Stevens's initial foray into main event wrestling involved his matches with one of the 1950s most colorful heels, Gorgeous George. It was a result of his work with George, that Stevens became a main event star. At this stage of his career, Ray Stevens was 17 years old. Stevens further developed his skills in tag team matches. He initially went into a partnership with Don Fargo as Ray and Don Stevens. In addition, on August 6, 1959, Stevens teamed up with \\"Professor\\" Roy Shire as \\"brother\\" Ray Shire to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Dick the Bruiser and Angelo Poffo. The Shire Brothers were involved in many famous angles until Roy moved on to become promoter of Big Time Wrestling wrestling programs in San Francisco's Cow Palace. One angle, which took place in Indianapolis on October 1, 1960, involved a \\"match\\" between boxer Archie Moore, a former World Light Heavyweight Boxing Champion, and the Shire Brothers. This match did not show Ray and Roy having any significant advantage over Moore. For one thing, the Shire Brothers were required to wear boxing gloves and follow the rules of boxing when they went against professional boxer Moore. Both Ray and Roy were \\"knocked out\\" in a matter of minutes. This match did not settle the argument as to who is the superior athlete, the professional boxer or the professional wrestler. A positive outcome of this \\"match\\" was the fans, who attended this event in large numbers, having the pleasure of seeing the long-awaited comeuppance of the arrogant and rule- breaking Shire Brothers. By the end of the 1950s, Ray Stevens was ready to move on to the next stage of his wrestling career, which took place in the city of San Francisco and throughout Northern California. ===Big Time Wrestling: the San Francisco years=== Stevens, reverting to his real name, started out in San Francisco, California for Big Time Wrestling on March 4, 1961, where he was involved in an angle with Pepper Gomez and captured the NWA United States Championship nine times and the NWA World Tag Team Championship three times. During his first televised interview on the Bay Area's KTVU Channel Two weekly Friday night wrestling show promoting his upcoming match at the Cow Palace, Stevens, speaking with a low pitched growl from the side of his mouth in the manner of a movie tough, shocked the fans when he said San Francisco was a terrible place to live. He also referred to those who watched the wrestling programs as \\"hillbillies\\" and \\"pencil neck geeks.\\" The insults thrown at the inhabitants of San Francisco caused a bit of a stir at the time which helped to further enhance Stevens' box office draw. One noteworthy characteristic of Ray Stevens was his flexible use of different cities being referred to as his birthplace. His actual birthplace was Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He was, shortly afterward, raised in Columbus, Ohio by his aunt during the years of the Great Depression. Whenever he was introduced by a wrestling program announcer in San Francisco, his birthplace was New York City. After moving to the East Coast during the early 70s, his birthplace became San Francisco. This was done to plant the idea in the minds of the fans that he was an outsider instead of one of them. The matches between Pepper Gomez and Ray Stevens, during the early part of the 1960s, certainly set the tenor for the Blond Bomber's dominance as top heel in the Bay Area during the entire decade. Gomez, at the time, had the reputation of having a \\"cast iron\\" stomach. He constantly challenged other wrestlers to jump on his stomach and try to get him to sell. Until the Blond Bomber came along, in May 1962, to pick up on this challenge, no wrestler was able succeed in causing more than just a little discomfort from jumping on his stomach. Gomez accepted a challenge from Ray Stevens to jump on his stomach off from a fifteen feet ladder which was placed in the center of the ring. Stevens did so from the halfway point on the ladder, but he did not succeed in getting Gomez to sell. Drawing from his seemingly inexhaustible arsenal of nefarious tactics, Stevens then went to the top of the ladder and, instead of jumping off feet first, he quickly switched to using his Bombs Away knee drop. The impact caused Gomez to spit blood and put him out of action for several weeks. After Gomez recovered from his \\"injury\\", he and Stevens had a bout at the Cow Palace which was attended by approximately 17,000 fans with many more turned away due to lack of space. This was the largest paying crowd to have attended any events at the Cow Palace, including a musical extravaganza which starred Elvis Presley. During 1962, the KTVU television station, in conjunction with its Friday night wrestling program, conducted a major survey which incorporated the opinions of wrestling fans in the Bay Area. The purpose of the survey was to determine which pro wrestler was considered to be the most popular and which one was the most hated. Unsurprisingly, Ray Stevens was selected as the most hated wrestler. However, many wrestling insiders were stunned to find that Stevens was also voted in as the most popular. This vote clearly shown the impact that Stevens had on the wrestling scene in San Francisco and its growing popularity among the fans. Another match, which took place in 1963, between Gomez and Stevens led to an unexpected ending. After a heated exchange of blows, Gomez grabbed the rather hefty time keeper's bell and spun around to take aim at Stevens‚Äôs head. Gomez apparently misjudged the weight of the bell when hitting the Blond Bomber. Stevens quickly fell to the mat and laid prone. It took a short while before it was noticed that Stevens was seriously hurt. He was taken to the hospital unconscious. Fortunately, he did not incur brain damage and eventually recovered the next day. The San Francisco Examiner's columnist Jack Rosenbaum, headlining his story about the incident as \\"A Touch of Realism at the Cow Palace\\", compared Stevens to a fallen Greek warrior from ancient times. Gomez was fined $5,000 (which was a large sum of money during those times) by the California State Athletic Commission for his part in this mishap. Since then, Stevens and Gomez had many bouts which were always well attended by the fans. During his San Francisco years, Stevens took on and vanquished wrestlers of such caliber as ‚ÄúCowboy‚Äù Bob Ellis, Karl Gotch, Pat O'Connor, Pepper Gomez, Kinji Shibuya, Bobo Brazil, Bruno Sammartino (through a count out), Pedro Morales, Dr. Big Bill Miller, Ernie \\"Big Cat\\" Ladd, Jose Lothario, and many others. More than any other move, the Bombs Away knee drop was the deciding factor in his victories. In 1965, Stevens teamed up with Pat Patterson to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They were known as the \\"Blond Bombers.\\" Stevens and Patterson had two runs holding the NWA World Tag Team title and one run with the AWA World Tag Team Championship. In 1969, after making a babyface turn, Stevens went against Patterson in a number of mat wars. On July 15, 1967, Bruno Sammartino, WWWF World Heavyweight Champion, wrestled a two out of three falls match for the title against the Blond Bomber in San Francisco. Stevens pinned Sammartino with the \\"Bombs Away\\" to win the first fall; Sammartino forced Stevens to submit to win the second fall; Stevens won the third and deciding fall via countout. It was later determined that according to WWWF rules, a champion could not lose the title due to a countout. Thus, Bruno Sammartino was able to return to the East Coast with his title still intact and the title change was never officially recognized. Stevens was known for using risky acrobatic moves in his matches. An example of a crowd pleasing stunt, created by the Blond Bomber in 1965, was the Turnbuckle Flip. After being arm thrown into the far corner, Stevens would go into a half somersault landing with his back on the top turnbuckle and then do a blade job on his forehead before falling to the cement floor. This bumping technique was replicated by a few wrestlers like Ric Flair as part of their in-ring repertoire. Over the years, Ray Stevens has been viewed by many wrestling insiders as the best worker during the 1960s. Stevens had the ability to make any opponent look good, no matter how badly they may perform in the ring. In addition, he was able to demonstrably convince the fans, through his ring work and his equally great interview work, that he could methodically and completely destroy anyone regardless of how strong or how big they may be. ===American Wrestling Association and National Wrestling Alliance=== He then moved on to the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1971, where he enjoyed success as a four-time AWA World Tag Team champion (three with Nick Bockwinkel, one with Pat Patterson). After that, he captured three NWA World Tag Team titles in Jim Crockett Promotions. It was on January 20, 1972 when Stevens and Nick Bockwinkel first captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship from Crusher Lisowski and Red Bastien in Denver, Colorado. The team was managed by Bobby Heenan beginning in 1974. While working with the AWA in 1972, Stevens had a television match with a masked wrestler known as Doctor X (Dick Beyer) in which he applied the Bombs Away coup de gr√¢ce to win the match while Doctor X's leg was tangled between two ring ropes. This resulted in the \\"breaking\\" of Doctor X's leg (which allowed Beyer to leave the area to work with a wrestling tour in Japan as \\"The Destroyer\\") and also led to the outlawing of the Bombs Away maneuver by the AWA. It was shortly after that match when Ray Stevens was no longer called the Blond Bomber and became known as \\"The Crippler.\\" In 1976, Stevens and Bockwinkel were still the team to beat, but friction was growing within the team. An angle developed where Heenan and Bockwinkel did the talking during their promos and cut Stevens off whenever he tried to speak. When Bobby Heenan was named the 1976 Manager of The Year by a pro wrestling magazine on a Christmas Day episode of AWA All- Star Wrestling, Bockwinkel attacked Stevens. This happened because the Crippler pushed Heenan, while Bockwinkel was trying to congratulate Bobby on being manager of the year; however, Stevens was able to get the upper hand and eventually destroyed a trophy presented to Heenan for his being named \\"Manager of the Year.\\" This led to the eventual break up of the team and a feud between the two to start the year 1977. ===World Wrestling Federation=== From there, he moved to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In the WWF, he was managed by \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie. Stevens and Captain Lou Albano turned on Jimmy \\"Superfly\\" Snuka (Albano was Snuka's manager) in 1982. This angle had the Crippler piledriving Snuka onto the concrete floor (before padding was introduced) two consecutive times. At this stage of his career, the mounting physical abuse after years on the road, with multiple injuries, difficulty in maintaining optimum conditioning, and his advancing age, along with promoters beginning to favor the use of more muscular physiques, had clearly began to take its toll. Stevens also briefly did color commentary alongside Vince McMahon in 1984. ===Late career=== After leaving the WWF, Stevens returned to the AWA, where he joined forces with Larry Zbyszko in feuding with the babyface-turned Bockwinkel, only to turn face himself after Zbyszko turned on him. Stevens was doing color commentary for ESPN's AWA Championship Wrestling during the AWA World Heavyweight title match between champion Bockwinkel and Curt Hennig in San Francisco on May 2, 1987 when interference by Zbyszko (who handed a roll of coins to Hennig from ringside to use against Bockwinkel) led to Hennig winning the title from Bockwinkel. Stevens and Bockwinkel protested the outcome of the match to the AWA Championship Committee, which held up the championship immediately after the match, but the original match decision was upheld days later after the committee ruled that there was no evidence that Zbyszko had illegally aided Hennig. As a result, the championship was returned to the now heel-turned Hennig. Stemming from the events of that match, Stevens feuded briefly with Zbyszko before finishing out his career in 1992, after 42 years. One of his final appearances was for WCW at Slamboree 1994 with other wrestling greats. On May 20, 2006, Ray \\"The Crippler\\" Stevens was posthumously honored by being inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame at Amsterdam, New York. He was the first professional wrestler to be selected for induction into two separate categories: Tag team (with Pat Patterson) and Modern Era (for his superlative work as a singles wrestler). ==Personal life== In 1952, Stevens was married to female wrestler Theresa Theis, who also did some work as Stevens' trainer and helped to hone his skills as a professional wrestler during the initial stage of his career. They were divorced in 1972. He appeared in the 1974 movie The Wrestler and the 1978 Sylvester Stallone movie Paradise Alley. In 1995, the mayors of San Francisco and Oakland jointly proclaimed April 5 \\"Ray Stevens Day\\". On May 3, 1996, Stevens died from a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Fremont, California. He was survived by five children: Carl, Timothy, Laura, Roy and Kelly. ==Championships and accomplishments== *American Wrestling Alliance **AWA United States Heavyweight Championship (7 times) *American Wrestling Association **AWA World Tag Team Championship (4 times) - with Nick Bockwinkel (3) and Pat Patterson (1) *Big Time Wrestling (San Francisco) **NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (San Francisco version) (2 times) **NWA World Tag Team Championship (San Francisco version) (5 times) - with Pat Patterson (2), Pepper Gomez (1), Peter Maivia (1), and Moondog Mayne (1) **Cow Palace Battle Royal (1969, 1972, 1980)http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ *Cauliflower Alley Club **Other honoree (1995) *Championship Wrestling from Florida **NWA Florida Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with Nick Bockwinkel (1) and Mike Graham (1) **NWA Florida Television Championship (2 times) *Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling **NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-Atlantic version) (3 times) - with Greg Valentine (1), Jimmy Snuka (1), and Ivan Koloff (1) *Midwest Wrestling Association **MWA American Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Don Stevens **MWA Ohio Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with Don Stevens (1) and Ed Francis (1) **MWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *National Wrestling Alliance **NWA Hall of Fame (Class of 2013)http://www.walkertexaslawyer.com/nwaringside.com/home/hall-of-fame/2013 *NWA Mid-Pacific Promotions **NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Hawaii version) (1 time) *NWA Mid-America **NWA Southern Junior Heavyweight Championship (3 times) *NWA Western States Sports **NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Amarillo version) (3 times) *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2006.

The school has previously been known as South-Eastern Minnesota School of Arts and Technology prior to 2003, and Northfield School of Arts and Technology from 2003 to 2012. ==History== A community group that included Jim Blaha, Winona Estes, Maryrose Gondeck, Keith Johnson, Leisa Irwin, Paula Manor, Anne Mikkelson and Griff Wigley founded Northfield School of Arts and Technology in 2001, with the purpose of creating a project-based learning environment similar to New Country School in Henderson. In July 2012 ARTech Charter School changed its name to Arcadia Charter School to emphasize its focus on all project learning not just project learning in the arts and sciences. During 2010-2011 the school expanded off its south side adding a science room (the Goodall Room) and an art room (the Tesla Room). A student- lead project installed solar panels on the building helping to reduce Arcadia's energy bill. In 2018 a student lead Eagle Scout Service Project built a picnic shelter in Arcadia's backyard which is now used for lunch and as a studying area. In 2019 the school completed a large renovation expanding off the south side of the building and renovating the old building to create three new classrooms. ==Curriculum== Today, Arcadia has 4 advisories. The high school advisories, Blue Advisory and Red Advisory, and the middle school advisories, Purple Advisory and Green Advisory. These act as a \\"homeroom\\" for students. High school students receive a desk in their advisory that they may decorate and use as their personal space to work on homework and projects. Middle school students receive a locker that they may decorate. They share tables with their fellow middle school students to work on projects and homework. Middle School students are required to take \\"CORE\\" classes that include ‚Ä¢ Art ‚Ä¢ Social studies ‚Ä¢ Math ‚Ä¢ Language ‚Ä¢ Science. High school students are required to have 23 credits in order to graduate. Students must do at least 1 credit of projects to graduate as well. Required credits include ‚Ä¢ 2 credits of literature ‚Ä¢ 2 credits of writing ‚Ä¢ 3 credits of Math ‚Ä¢ 1 credit of US History ‚Ä¢ .75 credit of World History ‚Ä¢ .5 credit of Economics ‚Ä¢ .5 credit of Government ‚Ä¢ .5 credit of Civics ‚Ä¢ .25 credit of Geography ‚Ä¢ 2 credits of Art ‚Ä¢ .25 credit of Arts Analysis ‚Ä¢ 7.25 credits of Elective Students can get these credits through required classes, elective classes (non-required classes) or independent projects. Some required high school classes at Arcadia include ‚Ä¢ Geometry ‚Ä¢ Algebra 2 ‚Ä¢ Basic Composition ‚Ä¢ Intro to Literature ‚Ä¢ U.S. History ‚Ä¢ World History ‚Ä¢ Intro to Art In 11th Grade, students must complete a Junior Project, where they will learn how to look for a residence, how to create a budget, and how credit and a credit score works. This is Arcadia's solution to the lack of necessary life skills taught in school. In 12th grade, students are required to complete a large project. This is called the Senior Project. It may be on any subject. This project is completed by the Senior Appreciation Day. Arcadia has a 6-day schedule, with 6 periods every day. Breakfast and Lunch is offered. ==Governance== ===School board=== The school is an independent school district, governed by a board of 9. The first school board meeting occurred on October 25, 2001.https://www.arcadiacharterschool.org/school-board/sb-members/ ===Directorship=== Arcadia Charter School is currently directed (a \\"director\\" is similar to a traditional principal) by Laura Stelter. *Leisa Irwin (2003 ‚Äì 2004) *Timothy Goodwin (2004 ‚Äì 2008) *Simon Tyler (2008 ‚Äì 2011) *Ryan Krominga (2011 ‚Äì 2015) *Patrick Exner (2015 ‚Äì 2016) *Barb Wornson (2016 - 2019) *Laura Stelter (2019‚Äìpresent) ==Renewable energy== Artech is on a team called Minnesota Schools Cutting Carbon, which is a team of 100 different schools in Minnesota reducing as much energy as possible in 3 years. ===Solar panels=== During the summer of 2008, Artech installed a 2.8 Kilowatt solar panel system, and has since seen a decrease in electrical bills. ===Greenhouse=== The greenhouse has been operating for 10 years and began as student led project. It is run through a 3 quarter long seminar that includes growing seedlings, writing a newsletter, and operating the greenhouse. ===Sustainable energy (\\"green\\") team=== Indeed, Artech also has a team focused solely on reducing the school's impact on the environment, lowering energy bills, and reducing the trash coming from the school. Some ideas they have for accomplishing these tasks are installing a Wind turbine, taking out light fixtures, and collecting runoff water. ==Student population== Arcadia Charter School currently holds roughly 120 students and 93.3% of whom are white. 22% of students are on a special education program. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Charter schools in Minnesota Category:Educational institutions established in 2001 Category:Northfield, Minnesota Category:Public high schools in Minnesota Category:Public middle schools in Minnesota Category:Schools in Rice County, Minnesota Category:2001 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"Arcadia Charter School"},{"id":"3257813","text":"Canadian-Yugoslav Boyan Vukelic initially studied Construction Management before choosing to train in the dramatic arts at the Gastown Actors' Studio in his hometown of Vancouver.

From 1929-1932, he led the Revolutionary Trade Union Opposition (Revolution√§re Gewerkschafts- Opposition; RGO) in the KPD Ruhr district and became in 1932 political leader of the KPD's Wasserkante district in Hamburg. In 1932, Saefkow married Theodora Brey who was also active in the underground resistance. ==Imprisonment== From April 1933 to April 1934, Saefkow was in a concentration camp, followed by two and a half years in a Zuchthaus at hard labour, followed by a spell at the Dachau concentration camp. There, he organized an illegal remembrance service for Edgar Andr√© and as a result was given another two years of imprisonment. ==Resistance== Released from detention in July 1939, Saefkow went back to the illegal political work. In Berlin, after the attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, he built up the biggest KPD resistance group, called the \\"Operative Leadership of the KPD\\". In 1944, he, Bernhard B√§stlein and Franz Jacob (Resistance fighter) led the Saefkow-Jacob-B√§stlein Organization which agitated against the war in Berlin munitions plants, and called on people to commit sabotage.Short biography of Anton Saefkow.

This often gives rise to a form of stratified chaos where the general behavior of the system can be modeled on one scale while smaller- and larger-scale behaviors remain unpredictable. For example: Consider a pile of sand. If you drop one grain of sand on top of this pile every second, the pile will continue to grow in the shape of a cone. The general shape, size, and growth of this cone is fairly easy to model as a function of the rate at which new sand grains are added, the size and shape of the grains, and the number of grains in the pile. The pile retains its shape because occasionally a new grain of sand will trigger an avalanche which causes some number of grains to slide down the side of the cone into new positions. These avalanches are chaotic. It is nearly impossible to predict if the next grain of sand will cause an avalanche, where that avalanche will occur on the pile, how many grains of sand will be involved in the event, and so on. However, the aggregate behavior of avalanches can be modeled statistically with some accuracy. For example, you can reasonably predict the frequency of avalanche events of different sizes. The avalanches are caused when the impact of a new grain of sand is sufficient to dislodge some group of sand grains. If that group is dislodged then its motion may be sufficient to cause a cascade failure in some neighboring groups, while other groups that are nearby may be strong enough to absorb the energy of the event without being disturbed. Each group of sand grains can be thought of as a sub-system with its own state, and each sub-system can be made up of other sub-systems, and so on. In this way you can imagine the sand pile as a complex system made up of sub-systems ultimately made up of individual grains of sand (yet another sub-system). Each of these sub-systems are more or less likely to suffer a cascade failure. Those that are likely to fail and reorganize can be said to be in a critical state. Put another way, the likelihood that any particular sub-system will fail (or experience a particular event) can be called its criticality. (See: Self-organized criticality) So then, the pile of sand can be viewed as a network of interconnected systems, each with its own criticality. The relationships between these groups impose a structure on this network which has a profound effect on the probability and scope of a cascade failure in response to some other event. In other words, - structured criticality. Structured criticality is found just about everywhere.

Thereafter he set about buying up neighbouring vineyards to accumulate a much larger holding,This larger estate was sometimes referred to by contemporaries as the Vegna Panfili, the \\"Pamphili vineyards\\" of the western part of the property which was often known as the Bel Respiro or 'beautiful breath' as it stood on high ground, above the malarial areas of Rome, and offered spectacular views which were a desirable feature of Baroque villa settings.The Pamphili preferred to call it the Villa dell'Allegrezze or ‚Äòvilla of joy‚Äô-- ignoring the stricture in Ecclesiastes 7:4 that gave rise to Edith Wharton's House of Mirth The giardino segreto parterre today In 1644 Cardinal Giambattista Pamphili became elected to the papacy and took the name of Innocent X. In accordance with this change in status, the Pamphili aspired to a grander and more expansively sited new villa. Early designs were made, possibly by Virgilio Spada rather than the traditional attribution to Borromini, but these were rejected.Montagu, Jennifer. Alessandro Algardi, Vol. 1, Yale, 1985, p. 94-6 Instead the project was placed in the hands of the Bolognese sculptor Alessandro Algardi in 1644, assisted by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi.Grimaldi has a modest reputation as a landscape painter but was responsible for the decor of the gallery in Palazzo Borghese in Rome: Howard Hibbard, \\"Palazzo Borghese Studies - II: The Galleria\\" The Burlington Magazine 104 No. 706 (January 1962), pp. 9-20. The initial design had a central casino (a house in the original meaning of the term) with wings, but only the central block was built. There is uncertainty as to who the architect was; Algardi was not an architect, and it may be that he had help from Carlo Rainaldi and that the construction was supervised by Grimaldi.Blunt, Anthony. Guide to Baroque Rome, Granada, 1982, p. 219 The layout has a central circular room around which the other rooms were arranged. Construction began in 1645 and was complete by 1647 although embellishments and the garden layouts were not finished until 1653. The casino, sometimes known as the Casino del Bel Respiro, was designed as a complement to the Pamphili collection of sculptures both ancient and modern, and other Roman antiquities such as vases, sarcophagi and inscriptions;Most of the Pamphili marbles are today in the Capitoline Museums. it was only ever intended for display of the collection and the family and guests resided in the older Vecchia Vigna Blunt, 1982, p.218-9 As a show case for sculpture, the somewhat crowded Casino facades have rhythmically alternating windows with niches which were elaborately adorned with sculptures, both antique and modern, with busts in hollowed roundels, with panels of bas-reliefs, and reliefs. ====Landscape gardens==== The exterior containing statues gives a rich allure that was architecturally somewhat conservative for its date, looking back towards the Villa Medici or the Casina Pio IV, and rather more Mannerist than Baroque. It offered a foretaste of the richly stuccoed and frescoed interiors, where the iconographic program set out to establish the antiquity of the Pamphili, a family then somewhat parvenu in Rome, with origins in Gubbio. Inside, Algardi provided further bas-reliefs and stucco framing for the heroic frescoes drawn from Roman history painted by Grimaldi. casino and the upper terraces; orange trees in pots punctuate its balustrades. Vasi merely indicates the patterned parterre beds on the lowest level, later swept away by the familiar extensive landscape. The casino is set into the hill slope such that the main entrance on the north side is at a level above the giardino segreto or ‚Äòsecret garden‚Äô enclosure on its south side, a parterre garden with low clipped hedges. The gardens on the sloping site were laid out from around 1650 by Innocent's nephew, Camillo Pamphili, formalizing the slope as a sequence from the parterres that flank the Casino, to a lower level below, framed by the boschi or formalized woodlands that rose above clipped hedges, and eventually arriving at a rusticated grotto in the form of an exedra, from which sculptured figures emerge from the rockwork. The exedra, now grassed, formerly enframed a 'Fountain of Venus' by Algardi, which is preserved in the Villa Vecchia, together with Algardi's bas-reliefs of putti representing Love and the Arts that were formerly here. The fountain spilled into a small cascade that let into a short length of formal canal, which was intended to remind the viewer of the similar \\"Canopus\\" at Hadrian's Villa-- another programmatic connection of the Pamphili with Antiquity. ===Villa Doria Pamphili === When Girolamo Pamphili died in 1760 without male heirs, the disputes which broke out among the possible heirs were settled in 1763 when Pope Clement XIII Rezzonico granted to Prince Giovanni Andrea IV Doria the right to take the surname, the arms and the vast properties of the Pamphili; the Prince‚Äôs claim was based on the marriage between Giovanni Andrea III Doria and Anna Pamphili. Since then, the villa has been known as the Villa Doria Pamphili. Throughout the 18th century, features were regularly added such as fountains and gateways by Gabriele Valvassori and other architects retained by the Pamphili and their heirs. After the Napoleonic era, more sweeping changes were made. The parterres that were formal extensions of the casino were retained but replanted with the patterned planting of colourful carpet bedding supplied from greenhouses by the old villa. (Today the parterres have been replanted in 16th-century style, with panels of scrolling designs in close- clipped greens set in wide gravel walks.) In the sloping outer gardens the changes were more extensive, recasting them in the naturalistic manner of English landscape gardens. The grounds, filled with many surprise features and picturesque incidents, swept down to a small lake at the bottom, which already had an air of atmospheric maturity when it was painted in the 1830s by Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps. In the wooded, natural-appearing landscapes with clumps of characteristic umbrella-like stone pines along horizons stand statues and vases, which evoke a nostalgic antiquity. The 18th-century English landscape gardens such as Stowe and Stourhead that were the inspiration for this style aimed to bring to life the Italian landscapes with Roman ruins painted by Claude and Poussin. A notable difference is that at the Villa Doria Pamphili's giardino inglese the Roman remains are likely to be genuine. The site of the villa contained several Roman tombs that yielded vases, sarcophagi and inscriptions that were added to the Pamphili collection. The \\"Arch of the Four Winds\\" on the site of the former villa Corsini During the defense of the short-lived Roman Republic in 1849-1850, Garibaldi hastily fortified three of the villas on the outskirts of Rome. The Villa Doria Pamphili lay near the scene of some of the fiercest hand-to-hand combat by the Porta San Pancrazio, as students joined Garibaldi's legions to defend Rome from the French troops that were eventually successful in reinstalling Pope Pius IX. In the course of the French bombardment, the prominently-sited neighboring Villa Corsini-- called dei Quattro Venti for its airy perch-- was destroyed. In the aftermath prince Doria-Pamphili bought the extensive Corsini grounds, almost doubling the Villa Doria Pamphili's already extensive grounds, and erected on the former villa's site the monumental commemorative arch, also known as the ‚ÄòArch of the Four Winds‚Äô, which has ever since provided the major access to the Villa's grounds. The Corsini casina near it, called the Palazzino Corsini, was not harmed. Today it is used for temporary art exhibitions. Around 1929 it was suggested that the Villa Doria Pamphili could be annexed to the new state of Vatican through the Lateran Treaty, but this proposal was not adopted in the final version of the Treaty. New constructions extended and altered the Villa Vecchia which was given a Romanesque styled fa√ßade that is not wholly successful. For the first time, Medieval sculptures were added to the Doria- Pamphili collection of Classical antiquities. At the turn of the 20th century, Art Nouveau interiors were added by Prince Doria Pamphili. The Casino del Bel Respiro, long secluded from public use, was bought by the Italian State in 1957 and used as the seat of a Ministry. Today its collection of antiquities and sculptures is open to the public as a museum. The park has an area of 1.8 km¬≤. It was bought in 1965-1971 by the City of Rome from the Doria-Pamphilii- Landi family. The park's facilities include sites for bird-watching and jogging, and it is much frequented by the inhabitants of Rome, especially on weekends. Arup's curving bridge now links the gardens' sections The two sections of the extended villa grounds are divided by a road built for the Olympic games of 1960 as part of the \\"Via Olimpica\\", linking E.U.R. with the Olympic Stadium: the road runs partly in a narrow defile. In celebration of the Jubilee Year of 2000, a curved and arching pedestrian bridge designed by MdAA and built by Ove Arup Group was built to join the two sections more amenably.https://www.mdaa.it/en/ponte-doria-pamphilj/ ==See also== * List of parks and gardens in Rome ==References== ==Further reading== *Barsali, Isa Belli. 1983 (revised edition).

Released by Columbia Pictures, the film is a sequel to the 1959 Sandra Dee \\"beach movie\\" vehicle Gidget. Dee was under contract to Universal for the rival series film Tammy Tell Me True (1961) and would not be released to Columbia to reprise her hit role. The sequel expands the archetypal high school teen surfer girl's romance with her college sweetheart Moondoggie. The film is the second of three Gidget films directed by Paul Wendkos. The screenplay was written by Ruth Brooks Flippen based on characters created by Frederick Kohner, who also wrote a novelisation of the film in 1961. Actor James Darren reprised his 1959 role of \\"Moondoggie\\", and another veteran of the 1959 film, Joby Baker, makes an appearance. Gidget Goes to Rome follows the film sequentially. Gidget Goes Hawaiian has been released to VHS and DVD. ==Plot== Francie \\"Gidget\\" Lawrence (Deborah Walley) and Jeff \\"Moondoggie\\" Matthews (James Darren) have just gotten pinned when Gidget's father announces that they are going to Hawaii for two weeks; the remainder of Moondoggie's summer break. Gidget refuses to go and leave Jeff alone. However, when Jeff encourages Gidget to go to Hawaii, an angry and disappointed Gidget gives him back his pin and tells her folks she has changed her mind. On the plane en route to Hawaii, Gidget meets Abby Stewart (Vicki Trickett) and her parents, popular dancer Eddie Horner (Michael Callan), and several more boys. In recounting her break-up to Abby, Gidget dramatically describes having gone overboard and \\"surrendered herself completely,\\" which Abby misinterprets as \\"she went all the way\\". As heart- broken Gidget mopes in her room, her father feels badly and decides to send for Jeff, suggesting that he come to Hawaii to surprise Gidget. Jeff immediately accepts. That night, Abby visits Gidget and invites her to join her and Eddie and the rest of the gang. Gidget declines at first, but her mother persuades her to change her mind. When Gidget makes a big hit with the boys and dances with Eddie, she inadvertently becomes Abby's rival. Gidget makes an even bigger impression surfing the next day, leading to an unexpected kiss from Eddie just as Jeff arrives. The two argue and finally decide to go their separate ways. That night at dinner, Jeff arrives with Abby (who is unaware that he is Gidget's boyfriend \\"Moondoggie\\") and Gidget retaliates by flirting with Eddie. The contest continues through water-skiing and other activities until Abby, fed up and jealous, decides to spread a wanton rumor that Gidget has slept with Eddie and other guys. Abby's mother relays this gossip to Gidget's mother, quickly leading to arguments between the two, between Gidget and her parents, and finally between both married couples. Gidget's father finds himself drinking with Abby's mother in the hotel bar, while Abby's father and Gidget's mother also make peace. The two mismatched couples eventually meet and resolve their respective disputes. At the Luau that night, Eddie runs into Gidget and confesses he's in love with her. A crestfallen Gidget tells him that she doesn't love him but they agree to be friends. However, Gidget still can't bring herself to go to the Luau since she doesn't know how far Abby's rumor has spread, so she goes for a walk alone on the beach and in a series of musical vignettes, pictures herself as a tramp, a fan dancer, and an unwed mother. Back at the Luau, Abby tells Jeff about the rumor that Gidget sleeps around, admitting that it's a lie and that Gidget only had one affair with a guy named \\"Moondoggie\\". Jeff then realizes how much he cares about Gidget, so he puts Abby in her place by telling her to call him what everyone at home calls him: \\"Moondoggie\\". Jeff and Gidget reconcile on the beach and head back to the hotel to straighten everything out with the adults. Through a few mix-ups, Gidget believes her parents are cheating on each other with Abby's parents, and Gidget's parents believe Gidget's gone missing and alert all of her friends, including Abby who deeply regrets the trouble she has caused. Soon, everybody is gathered in Gidget's room, deeply worried and unaware that Gidget is just down the hall in her parents' suite with Jeff waiting for them. As Gidget kisses Jeff on the couch, her father finally enters and expresses shock, then relief. Gidget tries desperately to cover for each of her parents' apparent indiscretions, but soon all misunderstandings are cleared up. Gidget and Jeff also explain their relationship to Eddie and the rest of the gang. The next day, as punishment for spreading the rumor, the guys drag a terrified Abby into the ocean and place her on Gidget's surfboard. When the surf comes rolling in, Abby frantically clings on for dear life while Gidget and Jeff enjoy riding the waves. ==Cast== * James Darren as Moondoggie (Jeffrey Matthews) * Michael Callan as Eddie Horner * Deborah Walley as Gidget (Frances Lawrence) * Carl Reiner as Russ Lawrence * Peggy Cass as Mitzi Stewart * Eddie Foy Jr. as Monty Stewart * Jeff Donnell as Dorotgt Lawrence * Vicki Trickett as Abby Stewart * Joby Baker as Judge Hamilton * Don Edmonds as Larry Neal * Bart Patton as Wally Hodges * Jan Conaway as Barbara Jo Wells * Robin Lory as Dee Dee Waters * Arnold Merritt as Clay Anderson ==Production notes== From over 150 actresses, Columbia chose Deborah Walley for her screen debut as the new Gidget.

The film was shot on location at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. Deborah Walley was doubled in surfing by Linda Benson. Not long after the Lawrence family arrives in Hawaii, Gidget's father, Russ Lawrence, realizes that Gidget is sad because she misses her boyfriend Moondoggie (Jeffrey Mathews). At about 24 minutes into the movie, Lawrence sends a Western Union radiogram to Moondoggie, who is staying with his friend Clay Anderson for the summer. Lawrence's goal is to encourage Moondoggie to come to Hawaii (\\"Gidget is miserable, please...\\"). The radiogram is addressed as follows: \\"Jeffrey Mathews, c/o Andersons, 1000 Linda Flora Dr., Los Angeles\\". 1000 Linda Flora Dr. was the address of the house in Los Angeles where Ruth Brooks Flippen, who wrote the screenplay for the movie, lived with her husband, actor Jay C.

Whether Stanwick was the stronghold of Venutius or Cartimandua, or perhaps of them both for a brief time before their acrimonious split some time after 51 AD, it is certain that this settlement was one of the most important in Brigantia, the Brigantes kingdom during the early stages of the Roman occupation of Britain. ==Location and etymology== The fortifications are located north of the town of Richmond and south west of Darlington, close to Scotch Corner and the remains of the Roman fort and bridge at Piercebridge. Rising to a height of almost 5 metres (16 ft) in places, the ramparts completely surround the village of Stanwick St John and form one of the largest Iron Age settlements in Britain, in extent if not necessarily in population. The name 'Stanwick' is thought to be derived from the Old Norse word 'steinvegges', meaning stone walls; although an Anglo-Saxon etymology, from stƒÅn \\"stone\\" and wic \\"settlement\\", is also plausible. ==Stanwick Hoard== In 1845 a hoard of 140 metal artefacts known as the Stanwick Hoard which included four sets of horse harness for chariots and a bronze horse head 'bucket attachment', were found half a mile away at Melsonby.Haselgrove, C: 'Stanwick' in Current Archaeology No. 119 (pp. 380‚Äì384), page 380 These are now held by the British Museum, which also has the Meyrick Helmet, which may have been part of the hoard, or made at Stanwick. ==Mortimer Wheeler excavations== Stanwick was the site of Sir Mortimer Wheeler's last major archaeological excavation in Britain, which he carried out over the summers of 1951 and 1952. Wheeler argued that the vast site had been constructed in three separate 'phases' starting from a modest earthwork enclosure on a low hill known as 'The Tofts', dated to around 40 AD (Phase I) then extended around 50‚Äì60 AD with a new enclosure to the north of over 130 acres (Phase II), and then finally, around 72 AD, extended by a further to the south (Phase III). During the course of his excavations, Wheeler cleared a section of ditch that the Brigantes had cut from the underlying limestone rock. He partially reconstructed a length of dry-stone revetment wall from the fallen stones found in the ditch. This was constructed to an approximate height of above the existing rampart, although Wheeler estimated that the original height of the wall above the rampart was probably closer to .Wheeler, M: \\"Reports of the Research Committee of the Society of Antiquaries of London No.XVII: The Stanwick Fortifications, North Riding of Yorkshire\\", pages 9‚Äì10, Oxford University Press, 1954 Known as 'Wheeler's Wall', this entire section remains preserved by English Heritage and provides the visitor to Stanwick with a clear impression of how awe-inspiring the fortifications would have been in Iron Age times. Amongst Wheeler's most famous finds at Stanwick were an Iron Age sword, unusually still in its well- preserved ash wood scabbard, and the nearby skull of a severed head, showing considerable damage from wounds inflicted by an axe or a sword. These were found in an excavation of a ditch terminal next to the location of the main north western gate and Wheeler believed they may have been hanging from the gate structure itself as a trophy or warning to enemies.Wheeler, M: \\"Reports of the Research Committee of the Society of Antiquaries of London No.XVII: The Stanwick Fortifications, North Riding of Yorkshire\\", pages 45 and 53 Oxford University Press, 1954 Wheeler concluded that Stanwick had been the rebel stronghold of Venutius, who had been the husband of the pro-Roman Brigantian queen Cartimandua, after he had split with her when she had taken his charioteer and armour-bearer Vellocatus as a lover and betrayed the rebel leader Caractacus to the Romans. Wheeler argued that Stanwick was the location where Venutius had rallied his anti-Roman tribesmen and allies for his revolt against the Roman invaders. ==Durham University digs== The next series of major archaeological excavations at Stanwick were carried out from 1981 to 1986 by a team from Durham University led by Percival Turnbull and Professor Colin Haselgrove. One of their most enigmatic finds was an adult male burial at the rear of a rampart in the fortifications where a horse's head had been carefully placed upon the body.Haselgrove, C. and Turnbull, P. with Fitts, M. and Van der Veen, M.: \\"Stanwick: Excavation and Research ‚Äì Third Interim Report 1985-86\\", page 10, University of Durham, Department of Archaeology, Occasional Paper No.8, 1987 and Haselgrove, C: 'Stanwick' in \\"Current Archaeology\\" No. 119 (pp. 380‚Äì384), page 384 Turnbull and Haselgrove argued that Stanwick's huge outer circuit of ditches and banks had probably been built first, during the mid-first century AD, and then the inner area sub- divided. They maintained that the six mile (10 km) fortification was too long to be easily defended and that its enormous size was intended instead to emphasise the power, prestige and wealth of its owner. They concluded that Stanwick had not been the fortress stronghold of Venutius but was rather the estate of his ex-wife, Queen Cartimandua, and possibly even the original tribal capital of the Brigantes. ==See also== * List of hill forts in England * List of hill forts in Scotland * List of hill forts in Wales ==ReferencesNorth Yorkshire County Council leaflet on Stanwick Camp * Page on English Heritage's website * Brigantes Nation Stanwick Site Visit * The Stanwick Fortifications * The Stanwick Horse Mask from the Stanwick hoard at the British Museum * Horse Harness from the Stanwick hoard at the British Museum Category:English Heritage sites in North Yorkshire Category:Hill forts in North Yorkshire Category:History of North Yorkshire ","title":"Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications"},{"id":"3257872","text":"Yuri Yatsev (born March 2, 1979) is a Russian water polo player who played on the silver medal squad at the 2000 Summer Olympics. ==See also== * List of Olympic medalists in water polo * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in water polo ==External links== * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Russian male water polo players Category:Water polo players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic water polo players of Russia Category:Olympic silver medalists for Russia Category:Olympic medalists in water polo Category:Sportspeople from Moscow Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics ","title":"Yuri Yatsev"},{"id":"3257874","text":"Todd Thompson may refer to: * Todd Thompson (bowler), PBA National Championship runner-up, 1988 * Todd Thompson (designer), clothing designer and former husband to Giada De Laurentiis * Todd Thompson (director), film director ","title":"Todd Thompson"},{"id":"3257883","text":"thumb is located at Lake Ch≈´zenji (source of the Oshiri River) in Nikk≈ç National Park near the city of Nikk≈ç, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan.

FEN records the en passant square field as the square just behind a pawn that has made a two-square push forward in the latest move. As such, whenever a pawn makes a two-square move, the \\"en passant\\" square is recorded. From the sample game given in Forsyth-Edwards Notation, we see that FEN includes the square e3 as an en passant square after White makes the first move of the game 1. e4. This is somewhat misleading, as no en passant captures can be made by Black from the position. X-FEN, on the other hand, includes only true en passant squares. That is, X-FEN records a value in the field for an en passant square only if there are one or more enemy pawns on the same rank on an adjacent file. Thus, after 1.e4, the field for the en passant square is left blank, as Black cannot make an en passant capture. However, it is possible that even if an X-FEN records an en passant square, making that capture would be illegal, because after the capture the king of the capturing player would be in check. === Encoding castling rights === Castling tags \\"KkQq\\" are used as known from FEN. As usual lower case letters indicate castling rights for Black, and uppercase letters those for White. \\"Kk\\" identifies the ability of g-castling (or i-castling in 10√ó8 Chess), and \\"Qq\\" indicates c-castling. The new and crucial point of the arrangement is that the castling rights provided by this as default are related to the outermost Rook of the affected side. If instead an inner Rook is associated with that right, the traditional castling tag will be replaced by the file letter of the involved Rook, using upper case for White. castling types Usually the King's castling target is either two squares away from the left (white) border or one square from the right border. But there are also variants having symmetrically distributed target squares (e.g. Janus Chess), both a single field distant each. Then an additional \\"s\\" has to precede the castling tokens. Another prefix \\"m\\" means: modern castling (e.g. Embassy Chess or Chess480). Here the King will move a regular castling distance (8√ó8: two steps, 10√ó8: three steps) aside, but at most just before the border. === 10√ó8 chess === Ten consecutive free squares in a rank are encoded by \\"10\\", and nine free squares are represented with a \\"9\\". For a princess (knight+bishop) the letter \\"A\\" is used, after its name in Capablanca Chess (the archbishop); an empress (knight+rook) is encoded using the letter \\"C\\" (as it is called the chancellor in Capablanca chess). As usual, lowercase letters are used for black pieces. == Compatibility == The starting position of traditional chess and moreover all of the 18 Pseudo FRC starting position arrays (with castling enabled Rooks and Kings situated in their traditional places) and positions resulting from those entirely will be identically encoded by X-FEN just as usual. Thus X-FEN is fully downwards compatible with traditional FEN. == Selecting games == To use only traditional chess games from within a PGN file (a problem present since Shuffle chess), simply select only PGN entries that do not include any FEN tags. == X-FEN example == Castling Right inner Rook before 11.

The company was founded in 1929 and operates in the USA, Singapore, Japan, Lithuania and China. It has the world‚Äôs largest network of schedules and travel status data. ==Early history== The \\"Official Aviation Guide of the Airways\\" was first published in February 1929 in the United States, listing 35 airlines offering a total of 300 flights. After the Guide was taken over by a rival publication in 1948, the September issue carried the OAG title for the first time. OAG was founded in Chicago, but moved to the suburb of Oak Brook, Illinois in 1968. The \\"ABC World Airways Guide\\" containing maps and tips for travellers was first published in the UK in 1946. The integration of the ABC and OAG brands occurred following the acquisition of OAG Inc. in 1993 by Reed Elsevier which already owned ABC International. OAG had acquired SRDS, an ad rate information company from Macmillan Inc., a sister Maxwell company, in 1992; Reed Elsevier sold SRDS to a buyout firm in 1994. In August 1996 all products from the combined ABC and OAG businesses were rebranded as OAG. In 1958, advances in computer technology enabled flight schedules to be sorted and presented by city pair, instead of under separate sections for each airline timetable. This Quick Reference Edition initially included North American flights; starting in 1962 a separate International Quick Reference Edition covered the rest of the world. The two Timetable Editions continued in the traditional format for several more years; the last Worldwide Timetable Edition was March 1969. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the OAG Quick Reference Editions began integrating computer-generated connecting flight information and tariff data, both also arranged by city-pair and merged with the flight information. In 1962, OAG began providing data to the first computer reservations systems and produced its first customised timetable for airlines. That year, it was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet. In 1970, OAG published its Pocket Flight Guide; it is still published today, in four regional versions. OAG participated in the development of the IATA Standard Schedules Information Manual (SSIM) for the interchange of airline schedules data. This was established in 1972 and is still the primary source of protocols and formats for the global airline industry. The OAG Electronic Edition was launched in 1983 and contained both flight and fare information. It was distributed through more than 20 system operators including Compuserve, Dow Jones and Viewtron. Additional databases (weather, arrival/departure information) were added in 1988. That year, Dun & Bradstreet sold OAG to Maxwell Communications. The company produced the industry‚Äôs first PC-based travel planning tool on CD-ROM in 1991, which was bundled with a plug-in CD drive, as those were rare at the time. OAG launched an analytical tool in 1998, and also its first browser-based travel information product. The Swedish CAA became its first internet timetable customer and the following year Cathay Pacific became the first airline to give its Frequent Flyer Club members online access to OAG Travel Information System through its website. OAG made its flight information available on the Palm VII wireless organizer in 1999, followed a few months later by its first WAP mobile phone application. ==Recent history== Reed Elsevier sold OAG to Electra Partners in 2001. After five years under private ownership OAG was bought by United Business Media in December 2006 to strengthen its aviation, transportation and travel business interests. UBM sold the majority of its data business to Electra Partners in 2013, who formed AXIO Data Group.UBM data service sale disappoints market In 2012, OAG launched OAG Analyser to deliver airline schedule analysis via an online accessible tool. In 2013, OAG added to its analytical suite with the launch of Traffic Analyser, a product developed in partnership with Travelport; a leading distribution services and e-commerce provider for the global travel industry. In 2014, OAG acquired the services of real-time flight information solutions provider, Flightview, to expand its flight data business. November 2015 saw OAG sell MRO Network, a provider of aviation exhibitions, conferences and publications to the MRO, fleet, financing and leasing sectors. On 16 February 2017, OAG was bought by British venture firm Vitruvian Partners. ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:1929 establishments in England Category:Analytics companies Category:Aviation in the United Kingdom Category:British companies established in 1929 Category:Companies based in Luton Category:Transport companies established in 1929 Category:Technology companies established in 1929 Category:Technology companies of the United Kingdom Category:Travel books ","title":"OAG (company)"},{"id":"3257921","text":"Arthur & George (2005) is the tenth novel by English author Julian Barnes which takes as its basis the true story of the \\"Great Wyrley Outrages\\". ==Plot introduction== Set at the turn of the 20th century, the story follows the separate but intersecting lives of two very different British men: a half- Indian solicitor and son of a Vicar, George Edalji, and the world-famous author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

He was the first Italian ambassador to Britain after World War II, and the first president of Alitalia from its foundation in 1948 until his retirement in 1968. ==Biography== Carandini was born in Como. His political career started in the 1920s when he got involved in the Italian democratic veterans movement, but he retired from political life after the rise of the fascist regime. In 1926 he married Elena Albertini, daughter of Luigi Albertini, who in 1925 had been removed by the fascists from his position as Director of the newspaper Corriere della Sera. Carandini then became chief administrator of the Torre in Pietra estate near Rome, transforming it into a modern agricultural enterprise. During the years of fascism he came into closer contact with democratic opposition groups around liberal philosopher Benedetto Croce and developed ideas of a modern reformatory liberalism, based on the principle of social justice. In May 1943, two months before the overthrow of Benito Mussolini, he wrote liberal pamphlets and organized their distribution in the Roman underground. In August, he joined other liberals such as Leone Cattani, Alessandro Casati and Mario Pannunzio to refound the Italian Liberal Party (PLI). After the armistice of September 1943 and the ensuing German occupation of Rome he joined the underground Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale (the political organization of the Italian Resistance). After the liberation of Rome in June 1944, he became Minister in the antifascist Bonomi government. In November 1944 he became Italy's first Ambassador in Great Britain after the end of the fascist regime (which still existed as a German satellite state in Northern Italy until April 1945). He proved to be an efficient diplomat in his efforts to regain British confidence in the new Italian democratic government, but wasn't able to avoid his country being treated as a loser of World War II by the British and their Allies in the upcoming Peace Treaties. In 1946 at the Paris Conference he brokered the Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement that settled the dispute on South Tyrol between Italy and Austria. He returned from Great Britain in autumn 1947. The 1947 Congress of the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) signed a complete split between the Carandini-led left and the majoritarian right of the PLI. Not being able to gain the support of the party-centre, in early 1948 Carandini and other left-wing liberals left the PLI, aiming to assemble a Third Force alliance of all centre-left democratic parties as a counterpart to the dominating Christian Democrats and to the rising Italian Communist Party. By 1951 those plans had failed, but Carandini had contributed in a change of the PLI-leadership (Bruno Villabruna) and a more progressive orientation of the party, which he and his movement re-joined in the end of that year. But in 1954 the liberals once again changed leadership (Giovanni Malagodi) and the following year Carandini and other left-wing liberals left the party for the second time to found the Partito Radicale that existed as a small party until 1962. After that date he retired from political life. Carandini was a leading member of the Movimento Federalista Europeo, founded in 1943 on the basis of the 1942 Ventotene Manifesto by Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi. In a controversial 1948 speech he argued that Britain's ties to Commonwealth and USA should not impede other European countries from forming the nucleus of a future United States of Europe. From 1948 to 1968 he served as president of the airline Alitalia. Carandini was second cousin once removed of the British actor Christopher Lee (who claimed it is he who suggested him to start an acting career). One of his sons is Roman archaeologist Andrea Carandini. One of his grandsons is neuroscientist Matteo Carandini. == References == Category:1896 births Category:1972 deaths Category:People from Como Nicolo Category:Italian Liberal Party politicians Category:Radical Party (Italy) politicians Category:Government ministers of Italy Category:Members of the Consulta Nazionale Category:Members of the Constituent Assembly of Italy Category:Politicians of Lombardy Category:Ambassadors of Italy to the United Kingdom Category:Italian resistance members ","title":"Nicol√≤ Carandini"},{"id":"3257937","text":"Argent a canton gules The canton of a baronet augments the arms of the Knowles baronets, of Lovell Hill In heraldry, a canton is a charge placed upon a shield. It is, by default a square in the upper dexter corner, but if in the sinister corner is blazoned a canton sinister. A canton is classed by some heraldic writers as one of the honorable ordinaries; but, strictly speaking, it is a diminutive of the quarter, being two-thirds the area of that ordinary. However, in the armorial roll of Henry III, the quarter appears in several coats which in later rolls are blazoned as cantons. The canton, like the quarter, appears in early arms, and is always shown with straight lines. The chequer, a pane of the field of chequy, can be considered a diminutive of the canton, though it cannot be a charge on its own. A canton sinister is a canton placed on the sinister side of the shield. An \\"enlarged sinister canton\\" appears in the arms of William Wilde Lotter. A plain, uncharged canton (sometimes a canton voided is also used this way) can be used as a mark of distinction, that is, not a mark of peculiar honour, but a mark denoting that the bearer is a stranger in blood. For example, a groom who does not descend from the bride's family but who adopts the bride's last name after the marriage might, upon receipt of a Royal Licence permitting this, use the bride's family's coat of arms with an uncharged canton or canton voided.

It is aimed at children ages seven to fourteen and is designed to teach children mathematical computation and problem solving skills. ==Gameplay== OutNumbered! is a side-scrolling educational game whose objective is to stop the Master of Mischief, a common antagonist of The Learning Company's Super Solvers series and Treasure series, from taking over a television and radio station before midnight. To do this, the player must deduce which room the Master of Mischief is hiding in by comparing sets of patterns for each room to those of the room the Master of Mischief is hiding in. To obtain the pattern for each room, the player must visit each room and solve a math puzzle related to that room. During the course of the game, the player will randomly happen upon the Master of Mischief's robot, Telly. Telly will attempt to knock down the player by either crashing into him or hitting him with hurled discs, sound waves, lightning bolts, or energy stars. If the player zaps Telly with his zapper before any of these things happen, and while Telly's belly is red, he will get a chance to earn a clue to the pattern of the room that the Master of Mischief is hiding in. When the player has all four patterns for the room the Master of Mischief is hiding in as well as those of each room, he must decide which room he thinks the Master of Mischief is hiding in. The player must compare clues obtained by zapping Telly to those for each room. If the player correctly guesses the room the Master of Mischief is hiding in, he will get a bonus score based on time and zapper energy remaining. This score will then be added to the player's lifetime score. If the guess is incorrect or the player fails to gather enough information by midnight, he will lose the game and his lifetime score will not change. As the player wins more games, his lifetime score will increase. At certain score amounts, the player will advance in rank and the game becomes more difficult, and the match rule changes. ==Development== ===Super Solvers series=== The Super Solvers series is a series of computer games released by The Learning Company that contain both educational and entertainment qualities.

Other programs in this series include Midnight Rescue!, Spellbound!, and Gizmos and Gadgets! among others. ===Music=== In lieu of original musical scores, OutNumbered! uses famous classical pieces as background music. The music played in the halls is from Mozart's 40th Symphony, specifically, its first and fourth movements. The music played in the rooms is based on Rachmaninoff's variations on Paganini's 24th Caprice.

In 1711-1717, he helped design the small church of San Giuseppe alle Fornaci near Foligno and as an assistant to Filippo Barigioni, he helped the enlargement of the facilities at the thermal baths of Nocera Umbra . In Rome, he was patronized by the Pamphilj family, helping design the main altar (1720) in the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone, which stands adjacent to the original family palace in Rome. In the 1730s, he helped in the designs of the Palazzo Doria-Pamphili. The complex we see today had expanded laterally from the palace at the site once owned by the Della Rovere and Aldobrandini families. Initial designs by Carlo Maderno, were amplified by Antonio del Grande and added to by Carlo Fontana (including chapel) and Francesco Nicoletti. Valvassori is responsible for the massive fa√ßade on the Via del Corso. For the Archiconfraternity of Padri Bergamaschi, from 1729 to 1735, he helped develop their property on Piazza Colonna, which included the Cerasoli College.

This film was Cher's least successful film of the decade in a starring role. The film was also widely panned by film critics, earning a 7% \\"rotten\\" rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. Multiple critics remarked that the story had obviously been written for theatre, and had not converted well to the motion picture medium. Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman described it as \\"an awkward hybrid of Deathtrap, Scenes from a Marriage, and a David Mamet barstool rant.\\" The Austin Chronicle gave it one and a half stars, commenting that \\"The dialogue packs a lot of witty one-liners, yet their power is insufficient to carry this dud. ... The comedy never works up enough froth to overcome the movie's implausibility. Palminteri is carving himself a familiar niche as a personifier of tough guys with soft spots, but this chatty hit man is not of this world.\\" Roger Ebert similarly praised the dialogue as clever but felt it was outweighed by the predictable plot and logic holes such as the \\"kill\\" signal being two telephone rings (apparently leaving no room for the possibilities of someone else calling the house or of Jack calling the hit off). He gave Faithful two and a half stars, summarizing it as \\"the kind of movie that's diverting while you're watching it, mostly because of the actors' appeal, but it evaporates the moment it's over, because it‚Äôs not really about anything. Nothing is at stake, the relationships are not three-dimensional enough for us to care about them, and it's likely that nobody will get killed.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:1996 films Category:1990s black comedy films Category:American films Category:American black comedy films Category:Films directed by Paul Mazursky Category:American crime comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films about psychiatry Category:Miramax films Category:Adultery in films Category:Films produced by Robert De Niro Category:Savoy Pictures films Category:Midlife crisis films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:1990s crime comedy films ","title":"Faithful (1996 film)"},{"id":"3257964","text":"The Civil Service () of Ireland is the collective term for the permanent staff of the departments of state and certain state agencies who advise and work for the Government of Ireland. It consists of two broad components, the Civil Service of the Government and the Civil Service of the State. Whilst these two components are largely theoretical they do have some fundamental operational differences. ==Background== The civil service of the Irish Free State, as the predecessor of Ireland, was not formally established by law. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 did however provide that the Government of the Irish Free State became responsible for those who were discharged or retired from the civil or public services in the new state, except a few exempted personnel recruited in response of the Anglo-Irish War. The exact status and compensation of such people was further codified in law by the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929. This had the effect that the state became responsible for essentially all former Dublin Castle administration civil servants based in the new state. The first attempt at formally regulating the civil service was the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1923 which was essentially a transitional arrangement and in 1924 was replaced by the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924. The result of these acts was the Civil Service Commissioners (later the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners), a commission of three persons charged with determining the standards for entry to the Civil Service of the Government of Saorst√°t √âireann. Entry to the civil service was generally by competitive examination, and a number of qualifications such as ability, age, character, health and knowledge could be predefined. Applicants also had to meet nationality requirements. The competitive examination system was created to ensure that the appointment of people to the institutions of the state would be based on merit only, and as such limiting any spoils system type influence. In retrospect however this often became criticised as being a rigid system in which promotion was based primarily on one's seniority and not on the ability of forward thinking or risk taking. A result of this was that the civil service became regarded as retaining its British outlook until well into the 1950s, T.K. Whitaker was among a new generation of civil servants who would \\"break the mould\\" and cast off this image. The Civil Service of the Government is the direct descendant of the Civil Service of the Government of Saorst√°t √âireann, as provided for in Article 56, of the Constitution of Ireland; one of the Transitory Provisions intended to ensure continuance of institutions of the state. A significant reform of the civil service occurred by the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 and Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956. These two acts however were deeply controversial in that they placed in statute law the requirement that many women would face mandatory retirement on marriage (the requirement was previously a regulation since 1924). This provision was finally rescinded by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973. In 2004 the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners was abolished and replaced by two separate bodies, the Commission for Public Service Appointments, a standards-setting body, and the Public Appointments Service, a central recruitment agency for the Civil Service. Since this time government departments have been allowed to recruit directly, though most still avail of the services of the PAS. The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 allows civil servants to work until the age of 70 if they choose. ==Civil Service== Organisational structure of the Civil Service showing junior and senior grades. All civil servants are expected to be impartial, and to act within the law. A member of the Civil Service is expected to maintain political impartiality and all grades must not seek nomination or election to the European Parliament or Houses of the Oireachtas. Certain grades are also barred from seeking nomination or election to local authorities. Civil servants above the clerical grade must not take part in public debate outside their normal official duties. For instance privately contributing to newspapers, radio, or television would be considered a violation of this principle. All civil servants, including those on career break or retirement are subject to the Official Secrets Act 1963, as amended, exceptions to this include the Freedom of Information Act. Civil servants must not take part in anything that may involve a conflict of interest, and if they seek outside work must bring it to the attention of their line manager who may refuse the request. Civil servant grades and positions defined as \\"designated positions\\" under the Ethics in Public Office Acts must make a disclosure of interests where they have a relevant interest. The grading structure is heavily based on that of the British Civil Service. Traditionally the Administrative Officer grade was the highest grade at which one could join the civil service, with higher grades filled by internal promotion. Entry positions are recruited openly by the Public Appointments Service (formerly the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission). The Social Partnership agreement Towards 2016 allowed for a proportion of the previously internally filled positions to be advisertised and filled externally, at the grades of Principal Officer, Assistant Principal and Higher Executive Officer. Many positions at Assistant Secretary level (generally the second most senior grade in a Government Department) have also been advertised externally in recent years. In some departments or offices, particularly at senior levels in the Civil Service of the State, different titles (such as Director or Commissioner) may be applied to positions instead of the traditional grade. There also exists the grades of Services Officer, Staff Officer, Administrative Officer, and Second Secretary which only exist in certain departments or offices. Specialist or technical positions may have a different grading structure. It has become practice in recent times for some outside advisors to also work in government departments, such as 'programme managers', however the conditions and remuneration of such individuals varies with government. ===Civil Service of the Government=== The Civil Service of the Government () is the body of civil servants which advises and carries out the work of the Government, through the Departments of State, of which there are fifteen; one for each Minister of the Government. The permanent head of a department is known as the Secretary General (equivalent to a Permanent Secretary in the British Civil Service). The head of the civil service is the Secretary General to the Government, who is also Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach. The largest reform of the civil service occurred in 1984 when the abolition of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs led to the halving of civil service numbers. The affected personnel, mainly postal and telecommunications workers, were transferred to An Post and Telecom √âireann respectively. ===Civil Service of the State=== The Civil Service of the State () is a relatively small component of the overall civil service, and its members are expected to be absolutely independent of the government, in addition to normal political independence which is expected. Civil servants in the offices of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Office of Public Works, Comptroller and Auditor-General of Ireland, Courts Service of Ireland, Director of Public Prosecutions, Garda S√≠och√°na, Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission,Section 71(3) Part 3, Garda S√≠och√°n√° Act 2005 Legal Aid Board, Houses of the Oireachtas, Irish Naturalisation & Immigration Service, Information Commissioner and Ombudsman are all considered to be part of the Civil Service of the State. Certain other offices are also prescribed under the Civil Service of the State. ==Footnotes== ==References== *Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, Standards in Public Office Commission, Dublin, February 2005. *Guidelines on Compliance with the Provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001, Standards in Public Office Commission, Dublin, June 2005. ==External links== *Public Appointments Service *Commission for Public Service Appointments *European Federation of Public Service Unions *A Review of the Civil Service Grading and Pay System 2008 *2010 Civil Service salary scales Category:Government of the Republic of Ireland Ireland, Republic of ","title":"Civil Service of the Republic of Ireland"},{"id":"3257982","text":"James Gavin may refer to: *James M.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 18, 2005. The episode follows Peter's decision to find a new religion for himself. After several failed attempts, he chooses the one man who has always been there for him, Fonzie, and starts the First United Church of the Fonz. The episode was written by Danny Smith and directed by James Purdum. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.26 million homes in its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by Paula Abdul, Tom Bosley, Gary Cole, Charles Durning, Sherman Hemsley, Phil LaMarr, Sherry Romito, Marion Ross, Amir Talai, Fred Tatasciore, Sarah Utterback and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. ==Plot== Peter's devout Catholic father, Francis, visits Quahog. Upon arrival, he insists that Stewie be baptized as a Catholic. After visiting a church with Peter and Stewie, Francis is informed that the holy water is tainted and he will have to wait. Francis is in disbelief, and baptizes Stewie himself. Stewie soon becomes unwell and is informed that he must be quarantined and kept in a germ-free environment by a doctor for the time being until his immune system's strength recovers at the end of the episode. Then Lois discovers that Francis coaxed Peter into having Stewie baptized without her knowledge, and tells Peter to choose his own religious beliefs and not allow himself to be a slave to his father's religion. Peter initially converts to Mormonism to take advantage of polygamy, but then discovers that Mormons cannot drink alcohol. He then tries Jehovah's Witnesses and attempts door-to-door preaching. However, when he finds someone who is actually interested in hearing what he has to say, he realizes he has no idea what to teach them. As a last resort, Peter tries Hinduism but gets himself kicked out after tackling the guru to the floor, believing the red dot on his head to be a laser spot from a sniper rifle. Unable to find a religion suited to him, Peter decides to create his own religion, based on Happy Days, calling his newly founded church the \\"First United Church of the Fonz\\". To the Griffins' (mainly Lois') surprise, many people turn up for the first worship service, much to the annoyance of Brian, who dislikes the idea that Peter is a religious leader (likely due to Brian being an atheist). In order to stop Peter from continuing his new religion, Brian joins forces with Francis to find a way to deter people from worshiping the Fonz. Three actors - serving as representatives from other religions - show up to the services of the Church of the Fonz. The first, Sherman Hemsley, informs people that he has formed the Church of George Jefferson (from All in the Family and The Jeffersons) and a good portion of the congregation leaves with him. The second person is Gavin MacLeod, who claims to have created the Church of Captain Stubing (from The Love Boat) and another chunk of the congregation leaves with him. The third person is Kirk Cameron and Peter assumes that Cameron is there to announce the formation of the Church of Mike Seaver (Cameron's character on Growing Pains), but Cameron lets him know that he's only here to convert people back to Christianity and the remainder of the congregation leaves with him. Back at home, Lois comforts Peter, who is upset at the failure of his Church, by telling him that if his church embraced the Fonz's values of friendship, it is worthwhile, but Peter highly doubts it and Peter converts back to Christianity, however the scene shifts and Francis is shown looking at a picture of the Fonz, puts it down on a table, gets on his knees as if to pray, and claps to the beat of \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" as the episode ends. ==Production== The producers were unable to get Henry Winkler, who played the Fonz (left), to guest star in the episode Episode writer and executive show producer Danny Smith has written all Family Guy episodes to date to feature Francis; the first was \\"Holy Crap\\". After Francis puts up the Christian cross on the Griffins' dining table, Stewie's line, \\"Yeah, nothing says 'eat up' like a bleeding, half-naked Jew nailed to a piece of wood,\\" was censored from the FOX and syndicated airings, but retained on the Cartoon Network, TBS, and DVD versions. A sequence shows Peter saying, \\"I'm sorry, but if another person says taint today, I am going to bust a nut\\", after the doctor informs him and Lois that Stewie was exposed to tainted holy water, was intended to be included in the episode, but was removed for unknown reasons. After Stewie is placed in a square box to quarantine him, Lois is shown leaving him halfway through changing his diaper‚ÄîStewie then says \\"finish the job, woman! It smells like New Orleans in here\\". The script for this episode, including this sketch, was prepared before the events of Hurricane Katrina, so it was never intended to coincide with the events of Katrina. On all airings (including the volume 3 DVD set), Stewie's line has been changed to \\"It smells like Brian Dennehy in here!\\" The Fonz Statue in Peter's church was originally meant to depict The Fonz in a way similar to Jesus's depiction on the Christian cross, but it was rejected due to broadcasting standards. An animated scene showing the congregation of Peter's church singing the Happy Days theme tune was created but never used as the series producers were unable to obtain the rights to it. The series producers were not able to get Henry Winkler or Garry Marshall to guest-star in the episode, so to fill the time gap, they created the scene about Madonna, which they deemed to be \\"quite funny\\". ==Cultural references== Gary Cole made a cameo appearance in the episode as Bill Lumbergh from the cult film Office Space. At the beginning of the episode, the family is watching Aquaman on television. Peter is shown watching Jaws 5 on the television, a sequence which MacFarlane describes as \\"one of [his] favourite gags [they've] ever done on the show\\". Stewie is shown asking viewers to change the channel to one which is showing Desperate Housewives. When Peter is describing Jesus, he does so in a similar manner to that shown on Quantum Leap. Peter's stuttering while attempting to say \\"wrong\\" is a reference to a scene in which Fonzie was unable to say the word on Happy Days. The episode uses a plastic bubble-encased Stewie as the pinball in a close parody of the Pinball Number Count from Sesame Street. At one point a modified video of \\"Opposites Attract\\" with Paula Abdul is shown with Peter dressed like a cat. The music playing in the background during the end credits is \\"Rock Around the Clock\\", the original Happy Days opening theme; additionally, the credits themselves are shown in a similar style and font. ==Reception== \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz\\" finished 40th in the weekly ratings for the week of December 12‚Äì18, 2005, with a Nielsen rating of 8.26 million viewers. Ryan Budke, of TV Squad, said, \\"This was one of the funniest episodes this year.\\" He added, \\"I was cracking up from beginning to end on this one.\\" He was \\"a little disappointed that Henry Winkler did not actually show up in the show\\". The Parents Television Council, a frequent critic of Family Guy, named the episode the worst of the week for its treatment of religion. ==ReferencesCategory:Family Guy (season 4) episodes Category:2005 American television episodes Category:Happy Days ","title":"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz"},{"id":"3257994","text":"Christopher Arthur Geoffrey Burney MBE (1917 ‚Äì 18 December 1980) was an upper- class Englishman who served in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. ==Biography== In 1941, Pierre de Vom√©court organized AUTOGYRO, one of the first resistance networks of Section F of the Special Operations Executive. Among de Vom√©court's recruits were Georges B√©gu√©, the first SOE agent ever to be parachuted into France, who was assigned as the wireless operator; Noel Fernand Raoul Burdeyron (real name: Norman F. Burley); and Mathilde Carre. Lack of money, weapons, and personnel, along with spotty communications with London meant that AUTOGYRO accomplished little. In frustration, Burdeyron/Burley singlehandedly derailed a German supply train by pulling up a rail, AUTOGYRO's only successful attack, causing considerable German casualties. Impressed, SOE decided to send Burdeyron some assistance. They recruited Christopher Burney, a lieutenant in the British Army and a trained commando, who had lived in France and spoke idiomatic French without an accent. On 30 May 1942, under the code name \\"Charles\\", he was inserted by parachute into France along with William Grover-Williams, on a different mission under the code name \\"Sebastian\\". After being blind-dropped into the French countryside, Burney made his way to his rendezvous with Burdeyron. Circling the building, he spotted several suspicious men watching from various positions. He immediately concluded that his rendezvous had been blown and AUTOGYRO betrayed (it had ‚Äî Mathilde Carre was in fact, a double agent). He quietly left, and never attempted any further contact with Burdeyron or de Vom√©court. Burney then tried to create his own network, but after eleven weeks learned that the Abwehr was passing around a circular warning bank clerks, hotel clerks, and others to be on the lookout for a man named \\"Charles\\" who was asking strange questions, and offering a reward for tips on his whereabouts. The circular contained a good description of Burney who, tall and blonde, was very conspicuous in Normandy. Deciding he had done all he could, he planned his escape over the Pyrenees to Spain and back to England. Grover- Williams offered his help, and Burney met with him several times to organize the escape, but on the morning he was to meet Grover-Williams for the last time, Burney was surprised in his sleep by Abwehr agents who had been tipped off by a hotel clerk familiar with the circular.SOE in France: An account of the work of the British Special Operations Executive in France, 1940-1944. M.R.D. Foot, HMSO, 1966 The Germans locked him up, first in Fresnes prison, for 15 months of solitary confinement, then in Buchenwald concentration camp. While at Buchenwald, Burney would meet F.F.E. Yeo-Thomas and also subsequently meet Phil Lamason, the senior officer in charge of 168 allied airmen and would help - at great risk - with their transfer to a POW camp. Freed in 1945, he worked after the war for the newly formed United Nations, helping to commission their building in New York City. When Dutch diplomat and UN Assistant Secretary-General Adrian Pelt was posted from 1949-1951 in the Franco-British UN Trust Territory of Libya as UN Commissioner for Libyan Independence, Burney was assigned as his assistant. In the 1950s, banking magnate Siegmund Warburg recruited him as a manager for the British and French Bank. Burney's younger brother, Roger Burney, was one of two British officers killed on 18 February 1942 when the French submarine Surcouf was mysteriously sunk in the Caribbean.

The fifth Trustee, Lady Friday, is mentioned at the end of the fourth book in the series, Sir Thursday, as a 'Doctor Friday'. Lady Friday is also mentioned in Grim Tuesday by Grim Tuesday as \\"that fool, Friday\\". Lady Friday is afflicted with the deadly sin of lust. ==Plot summary== At the beginning of Lady Friday, a cleaner tells Leaf that everybody has become infatuated with a \\"Dr. Friday\\", because she is so beautiful and refined; as a result, every member of the staff calls her Lady Friday. Lady Friday, a Denizen and Trustee of the House, is in command of the Middle House. It is later revealed that Lady Friday has kidnapped thousands of people and taken them to Avraxyn, the world that is mentioned in Sir Thursday as the world from which the Skinless Boy's mind-controlling mould originated. There, Lady Friday drains from them their emotions and memories, which she then drinks in order to experience them (being a House Denizen herself, she cannot have these emotions herself, but must take them from others). Arthur, the Piper, and Superior Saturday all receive messages from Lady Friday, saying she has abdicated the rule of the Middle House and that the first of the three who can reach her Scriptorium in the Middle House can claim the Fifth Key and her domain as their own. Along with each message is sent a Transfer Plate that sends whoever touches it straight to the Middle House (which is a giant, terraced mountain). Arthur accidentally takes the plate and is sent to the Middle House; he still retains the Fourth Key. While the Piper is contemplating what to do with his Plate, the Piper's Children Suzy Turquoise Blue and Fred Initial Numbers Gold, along with their loyal New Nithling bodyguard Ugham, grab it and are transferred to the Middle House. In the Middle House, Arthur takes refuge in a Manuscript- Gilding workshop, where he fights off some Fetchers and eventually meets Fred and Suzy. At first, he does not trust them, fearing their allegiance to the Piper; however, they and his own inclinations convince him that they can be trusted. Around their necks are bindings that bend them to the Piper's will; these are removed by Arthur with the power of the Fourth Key, at Suzy's behest. While on the way to the Scriptorium, they meet some of the Middle House's Winged Servants of the Night, who are fighting several of Saturday's elite forces, known as Artful Loungers. Arthur singlehandedly defeats four of the latter, earning the friendship of the Servants. While flying to the pinnacle of the mountain, on which stands the Scriptorium, Arthur is guided to the Fifth Part of the Will, which is chained within the lair of the Winged Servants. This part of the Will (shown on the British cover), a bizarre creature having the head of a fox, the upper torso of a bat, the lower body of a blue dragon, and four legs, is much more likable than the other parts; it is stated that this part, presumed to embody the virtue of moderation, is the part without which the Will has no self-control. When Arthur reaches the Scriptorium, he finds that the Piper has apparently killed Saturday's Dusk. The Piper orders Ugham to pick up what is supposed to be the Fifth Key; when Ugham does so, a trap from Lady Friday, in the form of an entrance to the Void of Nothing, is sprung. Ugham is instantly dissolved; as the breach gets bigger, Arthur decides to use the Fourth Key, even if it turns him into a Denizen, to close the hole. One Key alone is not sufficient to accomplish this task; therefore the Will advises him to call upon the power of the remaining Keys in his possession; the Keys appear with him, and he fixes the breach. To return to the Lower House, Arthur uses the Improbable Stair, the Architect's own personal transport, to transport himself, Suzy, and Fred to Monday's Dayroom. There, the butler Sneezer uses the Seven Dials to transport Suzy, Fred, Arthur, and their friend Dr. Scamandros to Friday's hideout. They find that Friday has lost her self-control and is about to \\"experience\\" thousands of people at once. Arthur arrives just as Friday transfers their beings into the Key; having obtained mastery of the Middle House, he returns their experiences. He finds that his friend Leaf was among the people, but that his own mother is not. It is confirmed thereafter that Arthur's mother is not in the Secondary Realms, and is therefore deduced to be in the Upper House. Arthur gives all the keys to the Will, except for the Fifth, and decides to go to Earth to settle matters there before going after Saturday. As the book closes, Suzy gives Arthur a note that Ugham gave her before he died. It appears to be a piece of a letter sent from Sunday to Saturday or vice versa. It reads \\"For the last time, I do not wish to intervene. Manage affairs in the House as you wish. It will make little difference in the end. S\\". The sender of this message, 'S', is presumed to be either Saturday or Sunday and is later revealed to be Sunday in Superior Saturday. The final sentence may remind readers of the suggestion raised in Sir Thursday by Dame Primus that the Trustees are wittingly or unwittingly part of a plan to destroy the House, and itself makes the suggestion that the sender believes the House to be doomed. ==Characters== Arthur Penhaligon- Rightful heir to the Architect, Master of the Lower House, Lord of the Far Reaches, Duke of the Border Sea, Overlord of the Great Maze, Commander of the Glorious Army of the Architect and Master of the Middle House.

Marie Bigot (3 March 1786‚Äì 16 September 1820) was a French piano teacher whose full name was Marie Ki√©n√© Bigot de Morogues. As a composer she is best known for her sonatas and √©tudes. Marie Ki√©n√© was born on 3 March 1786 at Colmarhttp://etienne.biellmann.free.fr/colmar/en/bigota.htm in Alsace. After marrying M. Bigot, she moved to Vienna in 1804, where she lived for five years. She was highly accomplished at the keyboard and played for Haydn, who exclaimed, \\"Oh, my dear child, I did not write this music - it is you who have composed it!\\" He wrote on the sheet from which she played, \\"On 20 February 1805, Joseph Haydn was happy.\\" She became a friend of Salieri. Her husband being the librarian of Count Razumovsky, she became friendly with Beethoven, who admired her playing.

In 1808, after a misunderstanding over Beethoven's invitation to take Marie and her three-year-old daughter, Caroline, for a drive and her refusal, the famous composer sent an apologetic letter to her and her husband, writing, \\"It is one of my foremost principles never to occupy any other relations than those of friendship with the wife of another man. I should never want to fill my heart with distrust towards those who may chance some day to share my fate with me, and thus destroy the loveliest and purest life for myself.\\"Kalischer, Alfred Christlieb, Beethoven's Letters V1: A Critical Edition, with Explanatory Notes, Kessinger Publishing, LLC (2008)p. 137.

The channel is produced in Toronto, Ontario for the entire SiriusXM platform. The channel's former names included Unsigned, and (un)Signed, which indicated that the channel played a combination of signed and unsigned bands. A few American songs, such as Hard Sun by Eddie Vedder (written and originally performed by a Canadian) are played on the channel. In August 2015, The Verge was added to the Sirius channel lineup. ==Radio Unsigned (2002‚Äì2005)== XM launched the original Unsigned channel (notice no parenthesis) in its rock selection as an outlet for all the unsigned rock bands out there to receive nationwide exposure. In addition to unsigned rock music, one of these bands would also have the opportunity to have Unsigned play their favorite popular band at a certain time each day. A popular show on Unsigned was The R>A>D>A>R Report, which actually started via internet in the late 1990s as a showcase for unsigned rockers. XM Satellite Radio picked up the show for its Unsigned channel, and the show now had a wide audience to broadcast to beginning on January 3, 2003. As Unsigned continued its parade of no-name up and comer rock bands, sister rocker XMU on XM 43 was also growing with its selection of independent and college rock. After a while, it looked as if XMU and Unsigned were slowly becoming the same channel, with similar bands being played. Some XM fans suggested a merger of the two channels, while others suggested niching the playlists a little more. On November 16, 2005, the \\"merger\\" people got their wish. ==(un)Signed (2005‚Äì2006)== In June 2005, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission gave XM's partner, Canadian Satellite Radio, the license to broadcast satellite radio in Canada. With this came some rules and regulations regarding Canadian content, forcing the birth of new channels on the line-up. Some channels were newborns, some were deleted completely and replaced with new ones, Unsigned on the other hand was the only one to be moved and reformatted. Thus, (un)Signed was born. (un)Signed was born as a station for new and emerging rock artists from Canada, and is currently on the entire XM platform in both nations. To maintain 100% Canadian content, The R>A>D>A>R Report was moved to XMU where it continues to broadcast weekly shows with encores. XMU did not receive a name change, but it now makes up more for the loss of the old Unsigned's playlist. == The Verge (2006‚Äì) == As of April 17, 2006, (un)Signed has renamed itself The Verge. The station now has DJs scheduled around the clock on extended shifts, and features the series LiVE@theVerge, which airs Wednesdays @ 6ET and replays Sunday @ 9ET. In the past LiVE@theVerge has included performances from Sam Roberts, The New Pornographers, Stars, The Stills, Wintersleep, Small Sins and over 300 artists from their street front studios in Toronto. In June 2008, The Verge broadcast the Calgary Virgin Festival live. Performances included Matthew Good, The Flaming Lips, Three Days Grace, City and Colour and Stars. In September 2008, The Verge broadcast the Toronto Virgin Festival live, including performances by Oasis, Paul Weller, Bloc Party, MGMT, Silversun Pickups, Stereophonics, Constantines and The Fratellis. On November 12, 2008, as part of the Sirius XM merger, The Verge moved from channel 52 to channel 87 on the XM service. It is still listed as X052-FM by Mediabase. Channel 52 is now Faction. Radio personality and music journalist Kim Hughes hosted programming in 2010. This channel, Laugh Attack, Radio Parall√®le, and/or ATN- Asian Radio will be preempted by XM Radio Canada in order to air extra NHL play-by-play on channels 235-239. ==Verge Awards== In July 2008, XM Canada instituted The Verge Music Awards, an award to be voted on by the fans in conjunction with an XM appointed jury to determine the winner based on \\"artistic integrity\\". The inaugural winners were announced on September 24, 2008 at The Tattoo Rock Parlour in Toronto. The Weakerthans were named Artist of the Year and Hey Rosetta!'s album Into Your Lungs was named Album of the Year.Wheeler, Brad, \\"Weakerthans, Hey Rosetta! win Verge Music Awards\\".

His father was an independent tradesman, craftsman, and dealer in building materials. At twelve years old Paul left Seifhennersdorf for Dresden, where he briefly attended Gymnasium before entering a teacher‚Äôs training school. By 1892 he was determined to pursue a career in the arts. In 1893 he was accepted as a student at the Saxon Academy of Fine Arts. In 1894, Paul moved to Munich, then the artistic capital of Wilhelmine Germany. He enrolled at the Munich Academy as a student of the painter Paul Hoecker, one of the founding members of the Munich Secession. Hoecker provided Paul‚Äôs introduction to the city‚Äôs circle of progressive artists, which included his classmates Reinhold Max Eichler, Max Feldbauer, Walter Georgi, Angelo Jank, Walter P√ºttner, Leo Putz, Ferdinand von Rezni√ßek and Walter Schulz. In 1896, Paul left the Academy to begin an independent career. After working briefly as a studio painter, he won lasting renown as an illustrator. He was a regular contributor to Jugend, the magazine from which the Jugendstil, the German counterpart to the French and Belgian Art Nouveau, derived its name. The leading figures of this movement, including Peter Behrens, Bernhard Pankok, and Richard Riemerschmid, as well as the majority of the founding members of the Munich Secession, all provided illustrations to Jugend. After 1897, Paul joined the staff of the satirical magazine Simplicissimus. Paul's weekly contributions to Simplicissimus between 1897 and 1906 won him international acclaim. == Jugendstil == In 1898, Paul, together with Behrens, Pankok, and Riemerschmid, was working as an applied artist. He was a leading figure in the development of the Jugendstil, and quickly established himself as the premier designer for the Vereinigte Werkst√§tten f√ºr Kunst im Handwerk, a maker of artistic housewares in Munich. The Jugendstil Hunter‚Äôs Room he designed for the Vereinigte Werkst√§tten in 1900 received a gold medal at the 1900 Paris International Exposition and was the first of a series of prestigious commissions that won widespread professional admiration. He won another gold medal at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, introducing his interior designs to a broad American audience. In 1906, Paul designed a festival decoration for a barracks in Munich, his first commission on an architectural scale. His design (perhaps apocryphally) impressed Kaiser Wilhelm II and facilitated his appointment to the vacant directorship of the Unterrichtsanstalt des k√∂niglichen Kunstgewerbe-Museums (educational institution of the royal museum of applied arts) in Berlin, an institution analogous to the South Kensington (later, Victoria and Albert) Museum in London or to the Art Institute in Chicago. Paul‚Äôs appointment in Berlin was part of a wider program of educational reforms promoted by Hermann Muthesius and Wilhelm von Bode. Paul, who was a member of the Munich Secession and the Berlin Secession as well as being one of the twelve artists who founded the German Werkbund, proved a committed reformer. He revised the curriculum of the Unterrichtsanstalt to promote practical craftsmanship as the basis of artistic education. He emphasized the training of professional designers for the applied arts industries, establishing a precedent that continues in schools of design to the present day. As a designer, Bruno Paul provided more than 2,000 furniture patterns to the Vereinigte Werkst√§tten. He also designed furniture for Deutsche Werkst√§tten Hellerau as well as designing ship interiors for the Norddeutscher Lloyd, Pianos for Ibach, and streetcars for the city of Berlin. Paul‚Äôs most historically significant furniture design was the Typenm√∂bel of 1908, the first example of modern, unit furniture conceived to allow an unlimited number of combinations of standardized, machine-made elements. Like much of his work, the Typenm√∂bel was widely published in contemporary professional journals. == Architecture == The so-called \\"Kathreiner-Hochhaus\\" in Berlin, 1928-30 Paul‚Äôs architecture was closely related to his designs for furnishings and interiors. Prior to the First World War he was best known as a residential architect. His houses were simple and elegant, efficiently planned and devoid of superfluous ornament. His favored vocabulary, an abstracted classicism, had a profound influence on the work of his students and apprentices. In 1914, Paul designed a model house and two restaurants for the Werkbund exhibition in Cologne. His buildings reflected the prevailing tone of the exhibition, and underscored the extent to which his pre-war work reflected the harmonious culture advocated by the Werkbund. After 1918, Paul‚Äôs architecture reflected the changing economic and social conditions of the Weimar Republic. In 1924, he designed the Plattenhaus Typ 1018 for the Deutsche Werkst√§tten, a prefabricated concrete dwelling developed in response to the pressing need for affordable housing. Although the stark, prismatic volumes of the Plattenhaus reflected the vocabulary of the neue Sachlichkeit, the elegant detailing was typical of Paul‚Äôs pre-war designs. By the end of the decade, he was completing large, commercial projects throughout Germany. In 1928, he was working on a department store for the Sinn company in Gelsenkirchen, the Dischhaus office building in Cologne, and the Hochhaus am Kleistpark, the first skyscraper in Berlin. The Sinn department store, with its cantilevered reinforced concrete frame and entirely glass curtain walls, exemplified the technical sophistication of these buildings, which demonstrated Paul‚Äôs mastery of the emerging International Style. == United State School for Fine and Applied Art == Paul implemented the full scope of his program of reforms in 1924, when the Unterrichtsanstalt was merged with the art school of the Prussian Academy. The new institution, the Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr freie und angewandete Kunst (United State School for Fine and Applied Art), provided a coherent educational program that encompassed every technical and creative aspect of artistic endeavor. As its first director, Paul led an institution regarded by Nikolaus Pevsner as one of the two most important in Germany. In the scope of its curriculum and its number of students, Paul‚Äôs school in Berlin far surpassed the other, the Bauhaus. Paul‚Äôs students, either in his nominally private architectural practice or in his academic atelier, included Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Adolf Meyer, Paul Thiersh, Kem Weber, and Sergius Ruegenberg. Paul's career was effectively terminated in 1933, when the Nazi accession resulted in his forced resignation from the Vereinigte Staatsschulen, his expulsion from the Prussian Academy, and his renunciation of the prospect of significant architectural commissions. As a teacher, designer and architect, Bruno Paul was one of the progenitors of the Modern Movement. His work embodied one of the most significant, and frequently overlooked, directions in the history of progressive design in Europe, that of a pragmatic Modernism attuned to the needs and desires of the middle class. Paul‚Äôs mature designs embodied simplicity and clarity of form, stylistic abstraction and functional elegance. By promoting these ideals through his involvement with the Werkbund, his leadership of the Vereinigte Staatsschulen in Berlin, and his prolific work as a designer, Bruno Paul facilitated the popular acceptance of Modernism as the characteristic style of the twentieth century. ==Further reading== * Wenzel, Paul, MONOGRAPH OF THE WORK OF BRUNO PAUL with 319 Photographs of Houses and Gardens, NY, Architectural Book Publishing, 1921. * Friedrich Ahlers-Hestermann, Bruno Paul: oder, Die Wucht des Komischen, Berlin, 1960. * Sonja G√ºnther, Interieurs um 1900, Munich, 1971. * Sonja G√ºnther, Bruno Paul 1874-1968, Berlin, 1992. * W.

He played a couple of Champions League and UEFA Cup matches this time. ===Fulham=== He joined Fulham on 31 August 2006, just prior to the close of the transfer window. He made his Fulham league debut on 2 December 2006 in a 2‚Äì0 loss against Blackburn Rovers. On 1 January 2007, he came on as a second-half substitute for the injured Antti Niemi against Watford, where throughout the game the Fulham fans cheered his every kick or save, as they feared he would make a mistake and cost them the game. The game ended 0‚Äì0. He left Fulham in May 2007 to return to his parent club. ===VfL Bochum=== Ukrainian League regulations called for all tems to field at least four domestic players each match, and so Shakhtar loaned La≈°t≈Øvka to German side VfL Bochum until the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season as a replacement for compatriot Jaroslav Drobn√Ω, who left the club for Hertha BSC Berlin. La≈°t≈Øvka started the season as first-choice keeper, but after some mistakes his position was threatened by the reserve keepers. After an injury, then third-choice keeper Ren√© Renno got his place. Renno started quite well but also made some mistakes before the winter break, so coach Marcel Koller claimed that all three keepers (La≈°t≈Øvka, Renno and Philipp Heerwagen) started at zero in the preparations for the second season half. After the winter break La≈°t≈Øvka was first-choice again and started with a very good match against Werder Bremen, which was rewarded with a nomination in the \\"Team of the Day\\" by Germany's leading football magazine kicker. At the end of the season Bochum were interested in signing him, but, due to the ‚Ç¨4 million transfer fee, they decided to sign Portuguese keeper Daniel Fernandes from PAOK F.C. instead. ===West Ham United=== On 3 August 2008 La≈°t≈Øvka signed for West Ham on a year- long loan deal. He made his debut for West Ham United in a Football League Cup third round tie away defeat at Watford on 23 September. On 26 May 2009, it was announced that La≈°t≈Øvka was returning to Shakhtar Donetsk, having made only one appearance for West Ham. ===Dnipro=== On 4 August 2009, La≈°t≈Øvka signed a three-year deal with Ukrainian team FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk for ‚Ç¨3 million.

He is also half of the hip hop duo Gangrene along with The Alchemist. ==Biography== Michael Woodrow Jackson was born on November 6, 1978 in Oxnard, California. He grew up in a family that was predominantly focused towards music at a wide spectrum, being the younger brother of hip hop artist Madlib, son of singer Otis Jackson, and nephew of jazz trumpeter Jon Faddis. Oh No started performing with his group Kali Wild and was featured on his brother's group Lootpack's album Soundpieces: Da Antidote. Oh No was signed to Los Angeles-based Stones Throw Records who released his debut album, The Disrupt, in 2004. Around this time he also performed on numerous singles by other artists, and began doing freelance production work for labelmates Wildchild, MED (Nickolas Rodriguez) and others. He has gone on to produce for Juggaknots, De La Soul, Murs and various other artists. In August 2006, Oh No released the album Exodus Into Unheard Rhythms, exclusively sampling the music of Galt MacDermot and featuring appearances from numerous other rap artists, mostly in the Stones Throw family. The album was well received by critics and established Oh No as one of the leading underground producers in hip-hop. In 2007 he released Dr. No's Oxperiment to rave reviews. The album was entirely constructed using samples of Turkish, Lebanese, Greek and Italian music. Oh No remains an avid gamer, even constructing an entire beat out of video game samples for the track \\"The Ride\\" off of The Disrupt.

Though she was most famous for her compositions, she was also an accomplished harpsichordist and singer, and the majority of her surviving compositions were written for keyboard, the voice, or both. Maria Teresa Agnesi Pinottini. ==Life== Maria Teresa was born in Milan to Pietro Agnesi, an overbearing man in the lesser nobility. He provided early education for both Maria Teresa and her more famous older sister, Maria Gaetana, a mathematics and language prodigy who lectured and debated all over Europe while her sister performed. Maria Teresa was married to Pier Antonio Pinottini on June 13, 1752, and they settled in a district populated by intellects and artists, but eventually suffered severe financial ruin. Pinottini died not too long afterwards. Maria Teresa died in Milan in 1795. ==Career== Not much is known about Maria Teresa. Nothing is known of her education or teachers, and the dates of her compositions are largely unknown. Many of her compositions have been lost, although there are records of their existence. Her career was made possible by the Austrian Lombardy, which proved progressive and enlightened in women's rights. The movement was more prevalent in Vienna and Dresden rather than her hometown of Milan, and Maria Teresa found more success and more appreciative audiences in these cities than in her birthplace. Maria Teresa had several famous performances, perhaps the most famous on July 16, 1739, when famous French traveler Charles de Brosses was very impressed by her music. He was not the only one; the Count Gerolamo Riccati wrote several letters praising her compositions and musical talent. Another very famous performance was her theatrical debut, the Cantata Pastorale Il Ristoro d'Arcadia, in Milan at the Teatro Regio Ducale in 1747 where she dedicated her piece to various rulers of the surrounding areas of Saxony and Austria. Agnesi would enjoy the patronage of Maria Theresa, holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Lombardy, and Maria Antonia Walpurgis, a gifted composer and contemporary. The Roman Empress was said to have sung at Maria Teresa Agnesi's famous 1747 performance. ==Legacy and influence== Today her music is seldom performed. Her keyboard music, while often technically challenging, is said to have been somewhat hackneyed and not distinctive. Her work does seem to have matured throughout her career; her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic. ==Compositions== Operas * II Restauro di Arcadia (cant. pastorale, G.

Mr. Melson was shot in the back of the head. On March 8, 1981, Melson asked his brother to go with him to Alexander's Grocery on Palm Avenue in Taft in south Orange County. McDonald chose to stay home, a decision that has haunted him ever since. About 11:30 a.m. White - an ex-con with a violent past - walked in and ordered Melson and Alex Alexander into the freezer. Prosecutors say he shot them in the back of their heads - execution style - to eliminate witnesses to his robbery. Melson, 34, a Vietnam veteran and Orange County equipment operator, died at a hospital. Alexander, 53, was paralyzed from the neck down and unable to speak. He spent four years in hospital, requiring a respirator to breathe before dying of heart failure and other complications. At White's 1982 trial jurors took only 40 minutes to convict him of first-degree murder and armed robbery. His last-minute appeals centered on whether his attorney had done enough and whether recently uncovered witness statements, blood splatters and White's IQ of 72 would have made a difference. Five courts decided White's fate would have been the same. In 1999, the state of Florida heard a petition from Thomas Harrison Provenzano, another Death Row inmate, that argued that the electric chair was a cruel and unusual punishment. During the proceedings, Michael Minerva, who had witnessed White's death, said that \\"White's body stiffened and was thrust upward and backward to the back of the electric chair\\" after the current had been switched on to the chair. He also said that he heard air moving through White's lips and throat, though he could not tell whether the air was going in or out. == See also == * Capital punishment in Florida * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in Florida ==References== ==External links== * Execution list of the State of Florida from 1976 to the present * Floridians for alternatives to the death penalty: list of executions * August 3, 1999 Order Upholding Constitutionality of the Electric Chair Category:1948 births Category:1995 deaths Category:1981 murders in the United States Category:People executed for murder Category:20th-century executions by Florida Category:People executed by Florida by electric chair Category:20th-century executions of American people Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Florida ","title":"Jerry White (criminal)"},{"id":"3258135","text":"The High Commission of Barbados in Ottawa () is the primary diplomatic mission of Barbados in Canada.

The town is situated approximately south-east of Croatia's second largest city, Split. Its location is where the Cetina River meets the Adriatic Sea. Omi≈° municipality has a population of 14,936 and its area is . ==Name== It is supposed that the name of this city, Omi≈°, developed from the Slavic Holm, Hum as a translation from the Illyrian - Greek word Onaion, Oneon, meaning \\"hill\\" or \\"place on the hill\\", or from Greek onos (œåŒΩŒøœÇ) meaning donkey, perhaps from the shape of the rocky promontory by the city (naming a city after a natural form was common practice then, as it is now); there is also the possibility that the name of the settlement Onaeum was derived from the name of the river which was called Nestos by the Greek colonists in its lower flow, during Antiquity. According to Petar ≈†imunoviƒá, Omi≈° is derived from Proto-Indo-European *almissa (\\"rock\\", \\"cliff\\"). Latin names during Ancient Rome were Onaeum, Oeneum, Alminium, and Almissum. During Medieval times the name was recorded as Olmissium, Almiyssium and from the end of the 15th century, when the city fell to the authority of Venetian Republic, its name was the Italian Almissa. ==History== Omi≈° Historical Coat of Arms from year 1541. Omi≈° was well known in the past by the Corsairs of Almissa (Omi≈°ki gusari) whose Sagittas (ships) (Genitive case: Sagittae, translated as The Arrow), brought fame to them because they were built for attack and fast retrieval into the mouth of the Cetina River, protecting the town from foreign invaders. At a very early date, neighbours of the Corsairs of Almissa, the highlanders of the Poljica Principality (Poljiƒçka Republika), became their friends and allies. This allowed them to harass the seaborne trade, without fear of a sudden attack from inland. *Historical monuments: ** Church of St Euphemia by the coast on Brzet, from the early 6th century ** Mirabella Fortress (Peovica) from the 13th century ** Starigrad Fortress (Fortica) from the 15th century ** Renaissance church of the Holy Spirit from the 15th century ** Old cemetery, the 16th century or 17th century ** Parochial church from the 17th century ** Franciscan Monastery on Skalice from the 18th century In the Priko neighborhood, on the right bank of the Cetina River, stands the site with the most historic significance: the pre-Romanesque Church of St. Peter (Crkva Sv.

It engages Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous Australians with the aim of building partnerships and celebrating youth and traditional culture. Over three fun days, primary and high school students participate in activities related to arts, education, health, careers, sports, health and reconciliation. In the evenings students stage non-competitive school dance performances under the stars. ==History== Croc Festival was created in 1998 after the former Queensland Minister for Health, Mike Horan, asked the producers of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge to find a way to get more indigenous students to attend school. The inaugural Croc Festival in Weipa (far-north Queensland) in July 1998 attracted 350 students from 17 schools in Cape York and Torres Strait. It was opened by the then Governor-General, Sir William Deane, who observed that the event was \\"reconciliation in action\\". In 2007 Croc Festival is expected to attract almost 20,000 students from 450 schools with a national audience of about 60,000 people. Croc Festival is 100% drug, alcohol and tobacco free. According to research and reports by teachers, outcomes for students include improved self-esteem and teamwork, improved tolerance of other students, awareness of personal health issues such as nutrition and mental health, and knowledge of the dangers of drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Further outcomes include increased rates of school attendance, improved literacy, numeracy and oratorical skills, and better goal setting for the future. Croc Festival in 2007 will be held on Thursday Island in Queensland, Derby and Mullewa in Western Australia, Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Port Augusta in South Australia, Kempsey and Dubbo in New South Wales, and Shepparton in Victoria. Students travel by road, air and sea to reach the venues, often camping in tents at Croc Village during the three- day festival. The not-for-profit Croc Festival is supported by community businesses, local, state and federal government funding, corporate and philanthropic sponsorship, and in-kind support. Croc Festival and the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge are part of the Global Rock Challenge family which engages youth in seven countries around the world. The Croc Festival was cancelled in 2008 due to a Federal funding cut. ==See also== *Rock Eisteddfod Challenge ==References== ==External links== Category:Indigenous Australian education Category:Festivals in Australia Category:Recurring events established in 1998 Category:Organisations serving Indigenous Australians Category:1998 establishments in Australia ","title":"The Croc Festival"},{"id":"3258192","text":"Blackmoor railway station, situated near to Blackmoor Gate at the western boundary of Exmoor National Park, England, was a station on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway, a narrow gauge line that ran through Exmoor from Barnstaple to Lynton and Lynmouth in North Devon. ==History== The station opened with the line on 11 May 1898, and closed with it after service on 29 September 1935.

Previously, he was the crew chief for Justin Allgaier, Tony Stewart, Kurt Busch, Kyle Busch, and J.J. Yeley in the Cup Series. Before that, he was a long-time crew chief in the Busch Series (now Xfinity Series), most recently for Mike Bliss, as well as an extended partnership with Jason Keller. ==Early life== Addington was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina. As a kid, he was a fan of dirt track races. At age 14, Addington's mother remarried and then the family moved to Batesville, Arkansas where his stepfather began working for Mark Martin. Although his stepfather worked for a successful Martin, Addington preferred to play football. He graduated from Central High School in Texas and moved back to Spartanburg. Addington's start in racing came as he helped friends compete in dirt cars.http://www.truespeedcommunication.com/media_kits/no._18_mms__interstate_batteries/2009%20Steve%20Addington%20Bio.pdf ==NASCAR career== Addington worked as Jason Keller's crew chief in the Busch Series, and the combination resulted in 10 wins, seven Top 10s, and finished in the season points. Addington worked in 2004 as the Joe Gibbs Racing crew chief for their #20 NASCAR Busch Series. Driver Mike Bliss finished fifth in points. In 2005, Addington was named the crew chief for Joe Gibbs Racing's #18 car driven by Bobby Labonte, replacing Mike \\"Fatback\\" McSwain. Labonte left for Petty Enterprises and was replaced by J. J. Yeley for two years. Kyle Busch replaced Yeley as the driver of the #18 car in 2008 and Addington remained as the crew chief. NASCAR observer's did not know what to expect from the combination, as the team did not just change its driver. It also changed from a Chevrolet car to a Toyota. On March 9, 2008, Addington scored his first win as a NASCAR Sprint Cup crew chief when the 18 team won the Kobalt Tools 500 in Atlanta, Georgia with driver Kyle Busch, and he was awarded the \\"Crew Chief of the Race\\". Busch lead the points with eight wins going into the Chase for the Cup. The team had numerous problems as soon as the Chase started, such as engine failures and wrecks, and Busch finished tenth in the twelve drivers in the Chase. Addington was named the DirecTV Crew Chief of the Year Award at NASCAR's award banquet. Busch ended the season with 21 victories in NASCAR's big three divisions (Sprint Cup, Nationwide, and Craftsman Truck Series), which was seven more wins that any driver had made since the Craftman Truck Series began in 1995. Busch said \\"I think the final ten races certainly humbled all of us. Everyone already had virtually guaranteed us the championship after seeing the first 26 races, but it changed so quickly.\\" Addington was relieved of his crew chief duties with three races left in the 2009 season and Dave Rogers took over the role. On December 14, 2009, it was reported that Addington had accepted a deal to become the next crew chief for Kyle's brother Kurt Busch, replacing outgoing crew chief Pat Tryson, who had been relieved of his duties following the 2009 Sprint Cup Season. It is reported that the deal is for three years. Addington ended his tenure as Busch's crew chief at the end of 2011. He joined Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR) owner/driver #14 Tony Stewart and Team Chevy, taking over for 2011 Sprint Cup Champion-winning crew chief Darian Grubb. Addington and Stewart had previous worked together at Joe Gibbs Racing. Addington was relieved of his duties as crew chief of the 14 on November 19, 2013.

Christian Karl Friedrich H√ºlsen (born in Charlottenburg, 29 November 1858; died in Florence, Italy, on 19 January 1935) was a German architectural historian of the classical era who later changed to studying the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. ==Biography== H√ºlsen was born in Berlin. He studied classical philology, ancient history and archaeology with Ernst Curtius, Johann Gustav Droysen (1808-1884), Emil H√ºbner (1834-1901), Johannes Vahlen (1830-1911), and Theodor Mommsen (1817-1903). His dissertation, on Ovid, was directed by Mommsen and H√ºbner. Through Mommsen, he was awarded a stipend from the DAI (Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut) to travel to Rome where he assisted in the compilation of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum for the city of Rome. In 1904 he published his Das Forum Romanum, an important and widely translated work on the Roman Forum. As a topographical scholar he gained equal fame with his volume on Roman topography, volume three of Topographie der Stadt Rom in Altertum, appearing in 1907. Despite these accomplishments and his service as second secretary to the DAI in Rome (1887-1909) he was twice denied the appointment of first secretary. In disillusionment, H√ºlsen left the institute to live in Florence, where he changed focus to medieval and renaissance art. In Florence he published studies on the historic drawings of Rome by Maarten van Heemskerck, Giuliano da Sangallo, Giovanni Antonio Dosio and other artists. In 1927 his study on the churches of medieval Rome and published Le Chiese di Roma nel Medio Evo. Like his other books in many disparate fields, it represented significant original scholarship. He remained in Florence for the remainder of his life except for five years as professor at the University of Heidelberg. He was the recipient of honorary degrees from Oxford, Erlangen, and New York.

During this period, Vladimir only missed the 1999 European championship after a doping scandal after the Italian Cup semi- final. In numerous surveys, he was elected as the world's best water polo player on the grounds that he can play equally well in all positions for the team. Forerunner of all-round player, he was a member of all possible ideal setups. He retired from the national team in 2008. Vujasinoviƒá is considered to be one of the best players in the history of world water polo. He played for Croatian Primorje, Serbian VK Crvena Zvezda, Spanish Barcelona, Italian A.S. Roma Pallanuoto, Serbian VK Partizan, Italian Pro Recco, Brazilian Fluminense. In summer 2007 he played with Maltese side Neptunes WPSC and helped them retain the Maltese First Division. He was named Most Valuable Player at the 2001 European Championship in Budapest, Hungary. Vujasinoviƒá won European Champions League several times with Italian Pro Recco (year 2007 and 2008) and Serbian VK Partizan. He rejoined Partizan Belgrade for the 2008/9 season. He won the Malta Waterpolo Summer League title with Neptunes Emirates (St. Julians, Malta) in August 2010. ===As coach=== Vladimir Vujasinoviƒá named as assistant coach of Serbian national team in 2012. With national team, he won 2016 Olympic Games, 2015 World Championship, two European Championships: 2014, 2016 and four World League: 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016. In 1 year and less than 2 months the Serbian National team had won the four biggest titles in Waterpolo in a row, nobody before him do it. ==Club== ===As player=== ====Neptunes WPSC==== Efforts to strengthen the team and try to retain the championship in 2007 were made immediately after the 2006 season ended. Serbian idol Vlado Vujasinoviƒá was snapped up from top Italian side Pro Recco and Sergio Afric‚Äôs immediate reaction to the club president was \\"Abbiamo appena vinto il prossimo campionato!\\" And how true that was. Vlado turned out to be the toast of the game‚Äôs connoisseurs as he managed to bring the best out of his colleagues with his superb marshalling at the back, closing all gaps and his play-making was the platform of Neptunes offensive stints. The final game that wrapped up the championship for Neptunes will go down in the club‚Äôs history as the biggest win they ever registered over Sliema ‚Äì 12‚Äì4. ====Partizan Raiffeizen==== 2011‚Äì12 season On 22 October 2011. Vujasinoviƒá scored two goals in the first round of the Euroleague Group, in an 8‚Äì9 loss to Szeged Beton VE.

Two families and their dogs competed for prizes in games and stunts oriented toward the dogs. ==Hosts and production notes== The host for the show's first two seasons was Steve Skrovan; he was replaced by Wil Shriner for the last two seasons. Skrovan had two female co-hosts, Roxie Stice for the early season one episodes and Susan Pari for the later season one episodes and the second season, during his tenure on the show. In season three, Shriner hosted solo, but during the show's final season, he was accompanied by a bull mastiff named 'Tiny', who showed signs bearing the name of the second event, wore a referee jersey for the Doggy Bowl event and brought medals for the dogs at the end of the show. The announcer for the early episodes of the first season was Gene Wood. But during the later season one episodes and for the rest of the run, Dean Miuccio took over as announcer. That's My Dog was filmed in Orlando, Florida. For the first season, the show was filmed outdoors near Residential Street at the Disney-MGM Studios backlot. For the second season, the show was filmed on Soundstage 23 at Universal Studios Florida. For the last two seasons, the show was filmed on Soundstage 2 at Disney-MGM Studios. In some of Season 3 and all of the season 4 episodes have an animated intro of the show. ==Game play== Two teams of three (sometimes two) family members and their dogs competed in a series of events fit for the dogs. These included going through a maze, performing tasks, the dogs' masters answering dog- related questions and finally a standard dog obstacle course. After five events, the dog (and family) with the most points won a year's supply of dog food and prizes for the rest of the family. ===Round One=== The first round was usually a head-to-head competition played under a 60-second time limit. Usually, both dogs received points based on their performance, with the better-performing dog earning an additional ten points. For example, in one event, the dogs went down a line of doggy treats (on pie plates), and for each one eaten, they would get 2 points, with a 10-point bonus for the dog who could eat more of them faster. One notable exception was \\"Doggie Bag,\\" in which the dogs and masters climbed into a large cloth bag and exchanged T-shirts; the team that first emerged from the bag within 60 seconds won 20 points. During the show's first season, the round one competition was played for 20 points (10 if the race was half done). ===Round Two=== From then on, each dog played separately. In round 2, each dog had (usually) 30 seconds to perform a stunt for points. For instance, in one event, the dog had to bring slippers back to their master, picking up 5 points for each slipper brought back and 10 bonus points for each matching pair. Another event gave the dog 30 seconds to jump over a bunch of hurdles of varying heights, starting at one point for the lowest one, and six points for the highest. If a hurdle got knocked over, it was out of play. ====Have a Ball (Skrovan Version)==== In round two of the season one episodes, the dogs faced a tray of six balls. Their job was to fetch balls back to their masters. Each fetched ball was worth 5 points for a maximum of 30. ===Round Three (Mixed-Up Maze)=== The third round was known variously as the Mixed-Up Maze, the \\"Twisting, Turning, Tricky Trail\\" and various other terms. Each dog had 45 seconds (60 in the final season) to get from the starting gate to their master at the finish line (who, true to the theme of the show, would be waiting in a doghouse structure during the final season). Along the way, the dog might be distracted by a sand trap filled with dog food, a toy car, a water bowl and other things. A dog making it through would earn 20 points, with the faster dog getting 10 bonus points (only applicable if both dogs completed the run). If a dog left the maze at any point other than the regular exit by either jumping over the outer wall or escaping through the giant mouse holes on the middle of each outer wall, that dog would be disqualified for the event and score no points for the run (and in the final season, a 'Runaway Dog!' graphic would pop up on the screen and sirens would go off). However, jumping within the maze structure was acceptable. During the early episodes of the first season, the maze was played first. ===Canine Quiz Round (First Season)=== During the show's first season, the dog's masters played the \\"Canine Quiz Round\\". Host Skrovan asked a series of six dog-related questions and the first player to buzz-in (also called 'barking in') was given a chance to answer. An incorrect answer from the bark-in player allowed an opponent to answer. Each correct answer was worth 5 points. Later on in the first season, the sixth and final question of the round was worth a special prize from the Doggy Bag. ===Round Four=== The fourth round had two different formats: ====Talent Showcase==== In the first three seasons, the \\"Talent Showcase\\", the dogs would perform a talent of some sort within a 30-second time limit, then a panel of three audience members would give the dog up to 30 points (10 from each panelist and in the last two seasons it would be as low as 0 from each panelist). After both dogs performed, the audience members won prizes. Note: During the early episodes of the first season, the Talent Showcase was played second and was called \\"Tricks 'n' Treats.\\" ====Doggy Bowl==== In the show's fourth and final season, the dogs and their masters went to the Doggy Bowl to play another game. Each dog would do a stunt much like in round 2, usually lasting 30 seconds, and would score points based on their performance. ===Doggy Decathlon=== The final round was the \\"Doggy Decathlon\\", an obstacle course. In the first season, the dog would have 60 seconds to complete 8 obstacles; in the second and third seasons, the number of obstacles was reduced to 7. In the final season, the dog would have 100 seconds to complete 10 obstacles. The course varied from week to week, but always (starting late 1992) ended with the dog leaping through the big letter \\"O\\" in the \\"That's My DOG\\" sign. Each completed obstacle earned 10 points; in the first season, a 20-point bonus was awarded if the dog completed all 8 obstacles within the time limit but during the second and third seasons, it was increased to a 30-point bonus if the dog completed all 7 obstacles before time ran out; in any case, a perfectly completed course would yield a total of 100 points. A dog could skip an obstacle, but jumping through the sign would always end the run, regardless of time remaining. ===Winning=== The team with the most points won the game. The winning family received prizes, while the winning dog won a year's supply of dog food (originally from Iams in the first season, later from Kibbles 'n' Bits for the last three seasons) and a gold medal. In some episodes where the final score was a tie, the dogs took turns wearing the medal; presumably, both dogs later received one. During the show's final season, there was a silver medal for the runner-up, and a gold one for the winner, both brought out by the show's resident dog Tiny. ===Special Episodes=== *Celebrity Dogs - celebrity dogs Rin Tin Tin (of Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop) and Dryfuss (Bear from Empty Nest) competed, but they each came in with one master; they both played for charity. *Christmas - in the fourth and final season, there was a Christmas themed show with appropriately themed events. *Puppy Love - also in the final season of the show, there was a special Puppy Love episode aired where puppies did the events that adult dogs normally did. One of the puppies was actually only 10 days old (announced on the show), surprisingly enough. This turned out to be one of the lowest scoring games (before the Doggy Decathlon) in the history of the show, with both puppies struggling to reach double digits before the final event. It was likely the only time in the final season that both contestants failed to finish the decathlon before time expired (the closer one still had several obstacles to go when time ran out). ==External links== * Category:Cable game shows Category:1990s American game shows Category:1991 American television series debuts Category:1995 American television series endings Category:The Family Channel (American TV network, founded 1990) original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:American television series based on British television series ","title":"That's My Dog (American game show)"},{"id":"3258252","text":"Caffyns Halt was a halt on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway, a narrow gauge line that ran through Exmoor, England, from Barnstaple to Lynton and Lynmouth in North Devon.

The station is also used by residents of the west of County Londonderry, much of west Tyrone and County Donegal. It is operated by Northern Ireland Railways. It serves the line to Belfast, whose other terminus is Great Victoria Street. ==History== The original Londonderry Waterside Station was opened on 29 December 1852 by Steven Alfred John Campbell, a well-known banker of the time. It was rebuilt into the current building by the Belfast & Northern Counties Railway in 1874. Derry historically had four passenger termini. On the west side of the river, Graving Dock station served the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway and destinations to the west and Foyle Road station (which replaced the short- lived Cow Market station) served the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway to Enniskillen via Strabane and Omagh. On the east side of the river, Victoria Road station served the alternative Donegal Railway Company (later Great Northern Railway) line to Strabane and Waterside station served the line to Belfast via the north coast. Although passenger trains terminated at these respective stations, all four railways were linked by freight lines through the city and the Craigavon Bridge. As a result of a series of closures of the other lines, Waterside was the only station to have survived closure by 1965. Services were reduced and the track layout was severely rationalised. The line now consists of a single track with passing loops at Bellarena and Coleraine stations. The station name was changed to Londonderry, as the suffix Waterside became redundant upon closure of the city's two other railway termini. Although this is the station's official name and the one used on signs, the destination signs on Northern Ireland Railways trains read Derry/Londonderry. The 1980 station, in use until 2019. The station was damaged in two terrorist attacks in the 1970s forcing it to be closed on 24 February 1980. A third station of the same name replaced the larger terminus in 1980.

The 1980 station closed on 8 October 2019 to allow the completion of work on the new station on the former site just to the north. The new station on the site of the old Waterside Station opened for rail traffic 21 October 2019. The 1980s station was demolished on 5 and 6 December 2019. ==Design== The station uses the former train shed as a waiting room, caf√©, and ticket hall for NIR services to and from Coleraine and Belfast.

Participants in the discourse present competing definitions of the concept of courage. ==Characters== *Socrates *Lysimachus ‚Äì Son of the Athenian general and statesman, Aristides. * Melesias ‚Äì A friend of Lysimachus. *Nicias ‚Äì Athenian general and statesman, son of Niceratus. *Laches - Athenian general and statesman, son of Melanopus. *Aristides ‚Äì Son of Lysimachus and grandson of the eponymous general and statesman. ==Summary== ===Education and the value of military training=== ====Has military education a place in higher education? [178a‚Äì180a]==== Lysimachus, son of Aristides, and Melesias, son of Thucydides (not the historian Thucydides), request advice from Laches and Nicias on whether or not they should have their sons (who are named after their famous grandfathers) trained to fight in armor. After each gives their opinion, Nicias for and Laches against, they seek Socrates for counsel. ====Laches introduces Socrates to the discussion [180a‚Äì181d]==== Socrates questions what the initial purpose of the training is meant to instill in the children. Once they determine that the purpose is to instill virtue, and more specifically courage, Socrates discusses with Laches and Nicias what exactly courage is. The bulk of the dialogue is then the three men (Laches, Nicias and Socrates) debating various definitions of courage. ====Nicias on the advantages of fighting in armour [181e‚Äì182d]==== Nicias argues in favor of an education in fighting in armour for young men. He mentions that it promotes physical fitness, prepares a man for military duties, gives an advantage over untrained opponents, helps one understand military strategy, makes one braver, and gives one a martial appearance. ====Laches on the futility of fighting in armour [182e‚Äì184c]==== Laches argues against the need for fighting in armour by claiming that the Spartans do not practice it; the instructors that Laches has seen are not brave soldiers and so have not benefitted from this knowledge; and it causes cowards to take foolish and damaging military risks. ====The need for expert advice: are the generals qualified to speak about education? [184d‚Äì187d]==== Melesias and Lysimachus ask Socrates to decide which side is correct. Socrates begins by trying to clarify what the actual topic is. He determines that the issue is the care of young men's character and asks if there are qualified teachers for this. Socrates confesses not to be skilled in this and assumes that Laches and Nicias are either versed in character building or else know of experts in that field. Socrates proposes to question them about this to see if they have qualified expertise. ====The generals agree to cooperate with Socrates and put Their expertise to the test [187e‚Äì189d]==== Nicias warns about Socrates' philosophical methods of getting the interlocuter to examine their own conscience. Laches states that he likes to hear discussions that are \\"musical\\", when a person's discourse is in tune with their actions. Paraphrasing Solon, Laches agrees to participate in Socrates' inquiry because he likes to learn from good men. ===An inquiry into the nature of bravery=== ====The need to define bravery [189d‚Äì190d]==== Socrates uses a medical analogy to help define goodness: If eyes can be improved by adding sight to them, then a boys' character can be improved by adding goodness to it. As knowledge of what sight is is necessary before it can be considered as an improvement, so too it is necessary to have knowledge of what good is before it is used to improve a character. Rather than try to define what the whole of goodness is, Socrates thinks it would be easier to define an aspect of goodness that is relevant to the question: bravery. ====Laches' first definition: to be brave is to stand and fight [190e‚Äì192b]==== Laches advances that to be brave is to be a soldier who can hold his position in combat without running away. Socrates explains that his definition is very specific to military infantry and what he was really looking for is a notion of bravery that pertains to all military situations and extends to all situations in life. ====Laches' second definition: bravery is endurance [192b‚Äì193d]==== Laches offers an opinion that courage is \\"a certain perseverance of the soul\\". However, Socrates challenges this idea by arguing that there are many instances in battle when the prudent thing to do is to withdraw or flee. Since courage is a virtue, Socrates argues, it cannot contradict prudence, and therefore the idea that courage always demands perseverance must be false. Laches is forced to admit this contradiction. ====Impasse: Nicias is asked to help [193e‚Äì194c]==== Socrates expresses his perplexity in trying to account for bravery. Laches wishes to pursue the conversation, saying that he has a sense of what bravery is, but is not able to express it properly. Socrates states that like a good huntsman pursuing a trail, they must persevere in the search for their quarry. They invite Nicias to give his definition of bravery. ====Nicias' definition: bravery is a special kind of knowledge [194d‚Äì196c]==== Nicias then offers another definition. He suggests that courage is \\"knowledge of what is to be feared and hoped for both in war and in all other matters\\". ====Implications of Nicias' definition: can animals and children be brave? [196d‚Äì197e]==== Since bravery is the knowledge of what is fearful and encouraging, Socrates asks if a pig could be brave. Nicias denies that animals can be brave as he believes that a certain amount of wisdom is necessary for bravery and that very few people can be considered brave. Socrates playfully suggest that Nicias is being influenced by a sophist named Damon and offers to respond to Nicias' assertion. ====Nicias has defined goodness, not bravery [198a‚Äì199e]==== Nicias agrees that something 'fearful' is the expectation of a future evil and something 'hopeful' is the expectation of a future good. Socrates then argues that full knowledge of any subject involves an understanding not only of future matters, but also of past and present. Thus if courage is the knowledge of future evils and goods, it must also necessarily be the knowledge of those of the present and past too. He then asserts that Nicias' definition actually amounts to a definition of all virtue (since it implies knowledge of all good and evil) and therefore, since courage is in fact only a part of virtue, a contradiction arises and the definition must be false. ====The discussion breaks up: Socrates suggests they all have much to learn [200a‚Äì201a]==== And so, in the end, Socrates finds both his companions' theories to be unsatisfactory, and the dialogue ends in aporia, an English term derived from the ancient Greek ·ºÄœÄŒøœÅŒØŒ± meaning \\"philosophical confusion\\". ==Critical commentary== There are many different interpretations as to why the dialogue ends in aporia. Certain commentators, such as Iain Lane, view the Socratic method of elenchus as an end in itself; that debate is the central premise and function of the dialogue. Others, such as Gregory Vlastos, see the dialogue ending because of the specific deficiencies of the characters' definitions. ==See also== * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 228 ==Further reading== * Walter T.

The Halt which served the village of Parracombe comprised a simple wooden shelter and was not opened until 1 May 1899 -- almost a year after the line was opened on 16 May 1898 -- and closed along with the rest of the railway on 29 September 1935. It is planned this station will be reopened next by the Lynton & Barnstaple Trust. It will replace the station at Killington Lane a bit further to the north that was opened in 2006. ==History== The village of Parracombe was the second largest intermediate settlement along the route of the railway, however its population was less than 400 souls. There was local opposition to the line by one landowner, Mr. Charles Blackmore, of Court Place. However, he was the only detractor. His younger brother Mr Henry Blackmore, the proprietor of the Fox and Goose Hotel was actively supportive. The railway company was so short of money that no station was built here, despite meetings to decide a location for a proposed station. When the Halt opened it appeared in timetables as Parracombe Churchtown. Tickets were dispensed by the local Post Office. Even though it was a halt most trains stopped at Parracombe as there was a good water supply at the station, and the water supply often failed at Lynton and Lynmouth due to the height of the latter station.

The station was situated inland, about 2 km from Woody Bay itself. ==History== It opened with the line (as Wooda Bay until the name was changed in 1901) on 11 May 1898.The station building was designed by Jones of Lynton in a similar style to Lynton Town Hall.

NLMs can implement hardware drivers, server functions (e.g. clustering), applications (e.g. GroupWise), system libraries or utilities. NLMs were supported beginning with the Intel 80386-based NetWare version 3.x. Prior versions of NetWare had a monolithic kernel, and significant hardware or functionality changes required re-linking the kernel from object modules. Due to stability issues with early third-party NLMs, they never became popular for server application programming, with few exceptions like antivirus programs, backup programs and certain database products. ==Functionality== Upon loading, a NLM requests resources, such as memory and process threads, from the NetWare kernel. The NetWare kernel tracks such requests, and can identify memory and other resources assigned to a specific NLM. NLMs may auto-load other NLMs upon which they themselves depend. NLMs may register commands with the NetWare kernel, extending the command vocabulary available at the NetWare console prompt. When properly coded, NLMs can be re-entrant, allowing multiple instances of the same code to be loaded and run. ==Programming issues== Initially, Novell published a development toolkit for NLM programming including kernel API documentation and a C compiler (Watcom), but third-party support for the NLM executable function was very limited. In early NetWare versions (prior to v4.x), all processes were executed in the kernel address space, without specific memory protection. It was therefore possible for bugs in NLMs to overwrite the kernel's or other NLM's address space and ultimately crash the server -- in the mainframe-derived Novell terminology, this was known as an ABEND or ABnormal END. Moreover, NetWare used a non-preemptive, or cooperative, multitasking model, meaning that an NLM was required to yield to the kernel regularly. An NLM executing an infinite loop, for example, could therefore not be stopped. In NetWare v4.x, Novell introduced a limited form of memory protection, which was extended to Protected Address Spaces in NetWare v5.x. Through these mechanisms, properly-coded NLMs can be loaded into their own address space, and mis-behaving NLMs can be prevented from compromising the kernel integrity. ==Compilers== Official compilers that produce NLMs are: * Watcom C/C++ compiler / OpenWatcom * Metrowerks Codewarrior for NetWare * EPC C/C++ * Novell NLMLINK.EXE NLM development is also possible with GNU cc and binutils. More details are available in NetWare Loadable Module Programming HOWTO by Martin Hinner. == Client-side NLMs with NIOS == Announced in March 1995, Novell introduced a new 32-bit DOS/Windows NetWare client (Client 32 based on ODI32/NIOS) in 1996, replacing the former 16-bit client based on ODI/VLM. Its NIOS component (NetWare I/O Subsystem) used techniques similar to DPMS to relocate and run NLMs in protected mode and extended memory in order to reduce the conventional memory footprint of the client down to 2 to 5 KB. ==See also== * Virtual Loadable Module (VLM) ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Executable file formats Category:Novell NetWare ","title":"NetWare Loadable Module"},{"id":"3258315","text":"Aleksandar ≈†o≈°tar (; born January 21, 1964) is a Serbian water polo goalkeeper who played on the bronze medal squad of FR Yugoslavia at the 2000 Summer Olympics and on the gold medal squad for SFR Yugoslavia at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Extreme Associates, 431 F.3d 150 (3rd Cir. 2005), is a 2005 U.S. law case revolving around issues of obscenity. Extreme Associates, a pornography company owned by Rob Zicari and his wife Lizzy Borden (also known as Janet Romano), was prosecuted by the federal government for alleged distribution of obscenity across state lines. After several years of legal proceedings, the matter ended on March 11, 2009, with a plea agreement by Rob Zicari and Lizzy Borden. ==Leading up to the indictment== The filming of Lizzy Borden's movie Forced Entry, which included several simulated rapes, was covered in the PBS Frontline documentary American Porn, which aired on February 7, 2002; the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set.Cossman 2007: 56 Zicari was interviewed in the documentary; he defended the company's content and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft to take action against him. Zicari stated in an interview for the program, \\"We've got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for. I'm not out there saying I want to be the test case. But I will be the test case. I would welcome that. I would welcome the publicity. I would welcome everything, to make a point in, I guess, our society\\". These scenes possibly led to the subsequent undercover operation by federal authorities. On April 8, 2003, the premises of Extreme Associates were raided by federal agents, and five videos were seized. The United States Postal Inspection Service and the Pornography Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department's Organized Crime and Vice Division had conducted the investigation leading to the indictment. On September 5, 2002, a U.S. postal inspector had joined the Extreme website. Postal inspectors then viewed clips on the site, and ordered three videotapes which were sent to a postal agent in Pittsburgh. On August 6, 2003, Black, Borden and the company were indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh on ten counts of the production and distribution by mail and the Internet of obscene pornographic materials. Zicari and Romano faced a maximum total sentence of fifty years in prison, a fine of $2,500,000, or both. Extreme Associates, Inc. faced a maximum total sentence of a term of probation of fifty years and a fine of $5,000,000. The prosecution also sought forfeiture of the films charged in the indictment, all gross profits from the distribution of the films, and all property used to facilitate the alleged crimes, including the domain name extremeassociates.com. At the time it was the first major federal obscenity prosecution in ten years. Zicari's company is located in North Hollywood near Los Angeles. However, the indictment and trial took place in the Western District of Pennsylvania, from where undercover agents had ordered the offending materials, and video clips had been downloaded. Extreme also posted videotapes and DVDs to a distributor in the district. It has been alleged the authorities chose this area of Pennsylvania because they believed a conviction for obscenity would be easier to achieve in that socially conservative district than in California, as a jury would be more likely to agree the material offended the standards of its local community, which is part of the Miller Test used to judge obscenity in the U.S.Cossman 2007: 57 Mary Beth Buchanan The trial has been seen as a test case of the acceptable limits of pornography. Mary Beth Buchanan was the federal prosecutor in the case. In an interview on 60 Minutes she said, \\"We have just had a proliferation of this type of material that has been getting increasingly worse and worse. And that's why it's important to enforce the law, and to show the producers that there are limits. There are limits to what they can sell and distribute throughout the country.\\" Ms. Buchanan has also stated that \\"The lack of enforcement of federal obscenity laws during the 1990s has led to a proliferation of obscenity throughout the United States, such as the violent and degrading material charged in this case.\\" Buchanan has said that Zicari's comments on the Frontline program \\"helped us to determine that this was not a producer who was trying to comply with the law\\". Zicari remained in business during the trial; he continued to market and sell the five tapes that are at the center of the prosecution as The Federal Five, with a portion of the sales price going to his defense fund. Buyers of those materials do not break the law, since mere possession of obscenity (unlike production and distribution) is legal. The involved movies are *Extreme Teen 24: contains a scene of a naive supposed young girl being talked into having sex by an older man. The actress involved was over 18 but was dressed and acted like a young girl. *Cocktails 2: various scenes of women drinking vomit, saliva and other bodily fluids. It was the director's cut version of the film that was cited in the case. *Ass Clowns 3: a female journalist is being raped by a gang led by Osama bin Laden; the journalist is freed and the gang members killed. The director's cut version also contains a scene where Jesus steps off the cross and has sex with an angel. *1001 Ways to Eat My Jizz: Described on IMDb as eleven women performing oral sex on men and eating foods covered in semen. The film could be considered obscene because it appeals to a prurient interest, and the literary or otherwise socially seeming value is questionable. *Forced Entry: The film depicts the beating, rape and murder of women by a serial killer, who is eventually killed by a mob of vigilantes. There are three scenes which graphically portray rape and murder, and women are also spat on. Extreme's website called it their \\"most controversial movie\\" and \\"a stunningly disturbing look at a serial killer, satanic rituals, and the depths of human depravity\\". Forced Entry was directed by Lizzy Borden and released in 2002. Again, it was the director's cut version of the film that was cited in the case. The prosecution also charged the defendants with transmitting six obscene video clips over the Internet through the extremeassociates.com website. The six video clips were entitled \\"valeriejospit\\", \\"jewel\\", \\"PZ Summer Breeze\\", \\"dp-gangbang-7gen-X\\", \\"miacum\\" and \\"analasspirations1\\", and ranged in length from 37 seconds to two minutes, 54 seconds. The early developments in the case were covered in the 2004 TV documentary The Porn King Versus the President. ==Initial successful motion== During a hearing in November 2004, Zicari's lawyer, H. Louis Sirkin, argued that the right to privacy, recently confirmed and strengthened in Lawrence v. Texas, gave individuals the constitutional right to view offending materials in private, a right which cannot be meaningfully exercised without a corresponding right of companies to distribute such materials. The prosecution countered that an individual's right to privacy is unrelated to a company's right to commercial distribution. The defense moved to dismiss the indictments on the grounds that federal obscenity statutes violated the constitutional guarantees of privacy and liberty that were protected by the due process clause.Cossman 2007: 58 Referencing Lawrence v. Texas and Stanley v. Georgia, the defense argued there is a fundamental right to sexual privacy which includes the right to possess and view sexually explicit material in one's own home. The defense argued that this right was not affected by the fact that the material does not have any literary or artistic merit, and that since the federal obscenity laws imposed a complete ban on materials which people have the right to possess, they were unconstitutional. On January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster dropped the charges, agreeing with the defense that the federal anti-obscenity statutes were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want in the privacy of their own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued that the government had a legitimate interest in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by which parents can restrict children's access to Internet pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.Cossman 2007: 59 Judge Lancaster wrote: ==Appeal by the Department of Justice== The Department of Justice, then headed by Alberto Gonzales, announced on February 16, 2005, that it would appeal the ruling. That appeal was filed with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on April 11, 2005, argued on October 19, 2005, and decided on December 8, 2005. The appeals court reversed the lower court and reinstated the suit against Zicari and Romano, ruling that the lower court had erred in setting aside the federal obscenity statutes, which had been repeatedly upheld in Supreme Court decisions. The appeals court pointed to previous Supreme Court opinions stating that the right to decide whether a subsequent Supreme Court ruling invalidates an earlier one belongs to the Supreme Court alone, not to a lower court. The ruling concluded, \\"we have declined to equate the privacy of the home ... with a 'zone of privacy' that follows a distributor or a consumer of obscene materials wherever he goes\\", and concluded that precedent had not in fact been overturned by the Lawrence ruling, and the trial judge had erred in law to state they had. Only the Supreme Court could say if their own prior decisions had been overturned, and they had reserved that right to themselves in past cases. Furthermore, with regards to whether or not the fact of the Internet delivery made the community standards test inapplicable, the ruling argued, \\"The mere fact, without more, that the instant prosecution involves Internet transmissions is not enough to render an entire line of Supreme Court decisions inapplicable given their analytical and other factual similarities to this case.\\" The couple's attorney subsequently filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The petition, however, was denied. ==New trial== Following the Supreme Court's denial of the petition, the case was sent back to the district court. As stated in several adult trade publications including AVN, due to the company's economic failing, Zicari and his wife decided that they were not able to retain the legal counsel needed to successfully fight the reinstated charges with a lengthy court fight. Several attorneys involved with the case denied their lack of interest to represent Zicari. However none of these same lawyers stated they would engage in a long term trial pro bono when asked. On March 11, 2009, Extreme Associates and its owners pleaded guilty to the reinstated obscenity charges to avoid trial, effectively shutting down the company. Extreme Associates also apparently took its website down concurrent with the plea. The couple was sentenced on July 1, 2009, to one year and one day in prison. In late September, they began serving their prison sentences, Zicari at La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution in Texas and Romano at Waseca Federal Correctional Institution in Minnesota. ==Legal aspects and implications== Quotations from the appellate ruling: ==See also== * Rob Zicari * Obscenity * Lawrence v.

The saltwater naturally forms a vertical salinity gradient also known as a \\"halocline\\", in which low-salinity water floats on top of high-salinity water. The layers of salt solutions increase in concentration (and therefore density) with depth. Below a certain depth, the solution has a uniformly high salt concentration. ==Description== When the sun's rays contact the bottom of a shallow pool, they heat the water adjacent to the bottom. When water at the bottom of the pool is heated, it becomes less dense than the cooler water above it, and convection begins. Solar ponds heat water by impeding this convection. Salt is added to the water until the lower layers of water become completely saturated. High- salinity water at the bottom of the pond does not mix readily with the low- salinity water above it, so when the bottom layer of water is heated, convection occurs separately in the bottom and top layers, with only mild mixing between the two. This greatly reduces heat loss, and allows for the high-salinity water to get up to 90 ¬∞C while maintaining 30 ¬∞C low-salinity water.G. Boyle. Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future, 2nd ed. This hot, salty water can then be pumped away for use in electricity generation, through a turbine or as a source of thermal energy. ==Advantages and disadvantages== * The approach is particularly attractive for rural areas in developing countries. Very large area collectors can be set up for just the cost of the clay or plastic pond liner. * The accumulating salt crystals have to be removed and can be a valuable by-product and a maintenance expense. * No need for a separate collector. * The extremely-large thermal mass means power is generated night and day. * Relatively low-temperature operation means solar energy conversion is typically less than 2%.G. Boyle. Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future, 2nd ed. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2004. * Due to evaporation, non-saline water is constantly required to maintain salinity gradients. ==Efficiency== The energy obtained is in the form of low- grade heat of 70 to 80 ¬∞C compared to an assumed 20 ¬∞C ambient temperature. According to the second law of thermodynamics (see Carnot-cycle), the maximum theoretical efficiency of a cycle that uses heat from a high temperature reservoir at 80 ¬∞C and has a lower temperature of 20 ¬∞C is 1‚àí(273+20)/(273+80)=17%. By comparison, a power plant's heat engine delivering high-grade heat at 800 ¬∞C would have a maximum theoretical limit of 73% for converting heat into useful work (and thus would be forced to divest as little as 27% in waste heat to the cold temperature reservoir at 20 ¬∞C). The low efficiency of solar ponds is usually justified with the argument that the 'collector', being just a plastic-lined pond, might potentially result in a large-scale system that is of lower overall levelised energy cost than a solar concentrating system. ==Development== Further research is aimed at addressing the problems, such as the development of membrane ponds. These use a thin permeable membrane to separate the layers without allowing salt to pass through. ==Examples== The largest operating solar pond for electricity generation was the Beit HaArava pond built in Israel and operated up until 1988. It had an area of 210,000 m¬≤ and gave an electrical output of 5 MW. India was the first Asian country to have established a solar pond in Bhuj, in Gujarat. The project was sanctioned under the National Solar Pond Programme by the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1987 and completed in 1993 after a sustained collaborative effort by TERI, the Gujarat Energy Development Agency, and the GDDC (Gujarat Dairy Development Corporation Ltd). The solar pond successfully demonstrated the expediency of the technology by supplying 80,000 litres of hot water daily to the plant. It is designed to supply about 22,000,000 kWh of Thermal Energy annually . The Energy and Resources Institute provided all technical inputs and took up the complete execution of research, development, and demonstration. TERI operated and maintained this facility until 1996 before handing it over to the GDDC. The solar pond functioned effortlessly till the year 2000 when severe financial losses crippled GDDC. Subsequently, the Bhuj earthquake left the Kutch Dairy non-functional.. The solar pond powering 20% of Bruce Foods Corporation's operations in El Paso, Texas is the second largest in the U.S. It is also the first ever salt- gradient solar pond in the U.S.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.680.7971&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf ==See also== * Ocean thermal energy conversion * Ice pond * Seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) * Thermal storage * Deep lake water cooling * Cooling pond * Salt evaporation pond ==References== ==External links== * . * . * . * .

In essence Pallottino created the modern discipline of Etruscology and trained many of its leading practitioners. He published a massive corpus of material during his career and established a research center in Rome, today known as C.N.R. per l'Archeologia etrusco-italica. He was also influential in establishing the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Etruschi e Italici and its journal, Studi Etruschi. His own work covered Etruscan art and culture, civilization, and language. One of his most influential works was the handbook Etruscologia originally published in 1942 in Milan, but today available in numerous languages and still consulted by scholars and students alike. Pallottino was a member of the faculty of the Universit√† di Roma, \\"La Sapienza\\". In 1937, Pallottino wrote an article debunking the so-called \\"Etruscan Warrior\\" purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (by John Marshall under the direction of Gisela M. A. Richter), as a forgery. Richter remained unconvinced, but Pallottino was ultimately proven correct by the scholar Harold Parsons in 1961. Pallottino pointed out the Greek Hellenized world that Etruscan art emerged from. He wrote the volume on Etruscan Painting (1952) for Albert Skira's series on Great Centuries of Painting. In 1971 his Civilt√† artistica etrusco-italica summarized the previous two generations of work in Italian archaeology. He won the Balzan Prize in 1982 for Sciences of Antiquity \\"For his research work and discoveries of outstanding importance carried out in the field of the sciences of antiquity through the excavation of Pyrgi, his contribution to the interpretation of the Etruscan language and his revealing research on the origins of ancient Rome and the peoples of pre- Roman Italy\\" (motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). This included the momentous discovery of the Pyrgi plaques.https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/obituaries/massimo- pallottino-85-expert-on-ancient-etruscans-is-dead.html In 1997 Pallottino's memory and career were honored with the publication of a two-volume set, Etrusca et Italica: Scritti in ricordo di Massimo Pallottino.

Upon completion it will serve as a southern beltway around the metro Pittsburgh area from the Pittsburgh International Airport to the historic Steel Valley of the Monongahela River. The first section of the highway from Interstate 376 (PA 60 at the time) near Pittsburgh International Airport to U.S. Route 22 opened on October 11, 2006 at 3 p.m. Construction on a segment of the beltway that will link US 22 to I-79 near the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies is currently underway and planned for a 2021 opening, while the final segment from I-79 to PA Turnpike 43 is pending.Construction on Southern Beltway set for spring Beaver County Times (January 14, 2014)Phase II Of Southern Beltway Underway KDKA-TV (January 14, 2014) Federal approval has been given for both segments. Although PA Turnpike 576 runs north‚Äìsouth between I-376 and US 22, the route is signed as east‚Äìwest to reflect the routing that the completed beltway will take; PA Turnpike 576 will begin to have a more general east‚Äìwest routing when the second leg to I-79 opens in 2021. Like the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway, the Southern Beltway will have no direct connection to the Pennsylvania Turnpike's mainline despite being built and maintained by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC). (Both the tolled section of Interstate 376 and PA Turnpike 66 as well as the Northeast Extension have direct connections to the Turnpike's mainline.) Both highways, however, will have indirect connections with the Turnpike's mainline via I-376. ==Route description== US 30 PA Turnpike 576 begins at an interchange with I-376 and the entrance to Pittsburgh International Airport in Findlay Township, Allegheny County. From here, the route heads southwest as a four-lane freeway. The road heads through wooded areas, where it curves south and comes to an interchange with US 30\\\\. Past this interchange, PA Turnpike 576 continues through more rural areas and reaches the Westport Road interchange. Following this, the freeway crosses into Robinson Township in Washington County and heads south to reach its current eastern terminus at an incomplete three-level diamond interchange with US 22. PA Turnpike 576 is signed as an east-west route even though it currently runs southwest- northeast, with the eastbound direction heading southwest and the westbound direction heading northeast. ==Tolls== PA Turnpike 576 uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable by toll-by-plate (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass. A toll gantry is located along the mainline between exits 2 and 4. As of 2020, the toll costs $1.70 using toll- by-plate and $1.20 using E-ZPass. The Findlay Connector section of PA Turnpike 576 originally had ramp toll plazas located at the eastbound exit and westbound entrances of its three interchanges (excluding the western terminus at I-376). All toll plazas were equipped with an electronic fare collection system (E-ZPass) and for cash customers, a dual-height, automated machine for toll collection. On June 3, 2018, the turnpike commission implemented all- electronic tolling along the Findlay Connector section of PA Turnpike 576. The ramp tolls were removed and all-electronic tolls were collected from a toll gantry along the mainline. ==History== ===Early development=== While many metropolitan areas in the U.S. comparable to the size of Pittsburgh such as Baltimore, Cincinnati, Columbus, Indianapolis, Louisville, and Nashville have an Interstate beltway that serve both locals and long distance travelers as a way to ease traffic congestion, the Pittsburgh metropolitan area does not have a true beltway. With the exception of the rainbow colored Pittsburgh Belt System, most major traffic roadways either travel into the city (such as I-279 and I-376) or bypass it just outside the city limits (moving north/south I-79 and the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike/I-76), with I-70 to the south and I-80 to the north being a somewhat greater distance from the city. While it could be argued that Pittsburgh does have somewhat of an existing beltway with I-79 from Cranberry Township to Washington, I-70 from Washington to New Stanton, and the Turnpike from New Stanton to Cranberry, the distance of I-70 from the city in comparison to the other two highways make it a little farther out from the typical beltway. Additionally, I-70 in between Washington and New Stanton, as well as the Turnpike, are not up to modern Interstate Highway standards. Although Pittsburgh does have the pre-Interstate Allegheny County belt system, these are mostly on surface streets and are rarely promoted by the city and Allegheny County. The Southern Beltway, which would bring a southern road closer to the city core and serve as a partial beltway, was first conceived in the 1980s when the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway received new life with Act 61 legislation, which transferred control of that project from PennDOT to the PTC. Additionally, the relocation and expansion of Pittsburgh International Airport helped spur the project. Less than a year before the airport relocated to its new site, the PTC decided to move forward with the Southern Beltway project in 1991. ===Findlay Connector=== US 22 under construction. Ground on the first leg of the Southern Beltway, the Findlay Connector, was broken on November 12, 2003, connecting what was then PA 60 to US 22\\\\. The Connector was delayed by the discovery of state endangered short eared owls nesting at the Imperial Grasslands in the path of construction. The Findlay Connector received its name because it served as a connector from the Weirton, West Virginia/Steubenville, Ohio area to the Pittsburgh International Airport through Findlay Township. The connector reduced the average commute time between these places by at least 15 minutes. The Findlay Connector opened on October 11, 2006. Before construction of the Findlay Connector, residents from the Weirton/Steubenville area had to travel down US 22 all the way down to PA 60 in heavily congested Robinson Township, then take then-PA 60 North to the Airport. In 2009, PA 60 north of the interchange was rebranded as an extension of I-376. Due to funding limitations, as well as emphasis on connecting the two fragmented sections of the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway between Uniontown and Brownsville, the Findlay Connector would be the only section of the Southern Beltway to be built for a decade. ==Construction progress== ===US 22 to I-79=== On December 21, 2012, the PTC announced that construction of a 13.2 mile section between US 22 and I-79 will proceed. Completion date initially projected was to occur sometime in 2021, however weather conditions and certain other unanticipated delays has pushed the probable completion date closer to summer 2022. The toll route between US 22 and I-79 will feature all- electronic Cashless E-ZPass tolling as the Findlay Connector now does. On November 25, 2013, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a transportation bill into law, known as Act 89, that will raise vehicle registration fees and uncap the oil tax cap in order to fund transportation projects in the state. Act 89 is expected to provide funding to complete the Southern Beltway all the way to the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway and provide a little less than half of the $2.2 billion (as of December 2013) needed to complete the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway. The second leg of the Southern Beltway will be the first project completed with the new funding available for both the Southern Beltway and the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway. On January 13, 2014, the PTC awarded two contracts for the project, with an anticipated completion date of 2019, a year ahead of the original schedule. Increased activity in the Marcellus Formation, which was just beginning when the Findlay Connector opened in 2006, helped expedite the earlier opening date for the second section of the Southern Beltway. Construction started on February 17, 2014, with rock blasting on the unbuilt end of the US 22 interchange in order to begin building the bridge to carry the Southern Beltway over US 22, while a formal groundbreaking with Governor Corbett and other state officials occurred on May 12, 2014. Construction past the aforementioned interchange began in January 2017 and will eventually involve excavating underneath I-79 in order for the Southern Beltway to pass underneath that highway. Work is expected to begin on the 3.2-mile section of the highway between the Panhandle Trail and Cecil Reissing Road in Cecil in March 2017. It is a $90.6 million project. The second leg of the Southern Beltway is expected to provide a lot of economic development to rural northwestern Washington County. As part of the building of the road, Robinson Township has changed many of its zoning laws in order to provide development along the Southern Beltway corridor, including allowing hydraulic fracturing in certain zones. Additionally, since the project was announced, Royal Dutch Shell has gone through with plans to build a $6 billion cracker plant in nearby Monaca, Pennsylvania in Beaver County.Shell confirms it will build cracker plant in Potter Twp. The Beaver County Times (06/07/2016) This in itself has caused a major economic boom in the area, with numerous hotels and a mini-casino being built in the vicinity. == Future == ===I-79 to PA Turnpike 43=== In December 2014, it was reported that the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway and the Southern Beltway might get additional funding through foreign investors who obtain an EB-5 visa in exchange for investing at least $500,000 for public projects. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission will use EB-5 funding for the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project first before determining if it will use such funding for other projects. The PTC was expected to make a decision on how to proceed on the Southern Beltway's final leg by mid-2015.Pennsylvania Turnpike Southern Beltway extension gets funding Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (July 28, 2014) On June 18, 2015, the PTC announced that the final leg of the Southern Beltway would be restarted and return to the design phase, though no timetable for its construction has been established.Pennsylvania Turnpike officials revive Mon- Fayette Expressway extension Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (June 18, 2015) Due to ongoing financial issues with the PTC regarding Act 44, the future of the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway and the Southern Beltway was in doubt due to the PTC wanting to focus its capital expenses on its ongoing project of widening the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike to six lanes except at its tunnels. On November 16, 2016, the PTC announced that they wouldn't suspend any capital projects for the time being, but did place the Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway and Southern Beltway projects on a list to be suspended if ‚Äúfuture financial or economic conditions dictate a construction spending reduction‚Äù. The Mon‚ÄìFayette Expressway and Southern Beltway projects made the list despite the fact that the two projects are funded independently of toll revenue.

Koeppel (October 30, 1936, in Nuremberg, Germany - December 20, 2012 in Erlangen, Germany)http://classics.unc.edu/news-and-events/gerhard- koeppel#JUMP was a German-born historian of Roman art and a specialist in the study of Roman historical relief sculpture. Koeppel studied at the University of Cologne and under the ancient art historian Heinz K√§hler. Gerhard Koeppel was a member of the Archaeological Institute of America, the Classical Society of the American Academy in Rome, the Deutscher Arch√§ologenverband, and Corresponding Member of the Deutsches Archaeologisches Institut. He was Resident Scholar at the American Academy in Rome (1974‚Äì1975),American Academy in Rome, Fellows - Affiliated Fellows - Residents 1970-1989 http://www.aarome.org/fellows-affiliated-fellows-residents-1970-1989 Professor-in-Charge of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome (1980‚Äì1981, 1989‚Äì1990, spring 1998), and Director of the American Academy Summer School (1986‚Äì1988). He joined the faculty of Classics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1969 and was professor emeritus at the time of his death. Koeppel's scholarly work focused on the development of the iconography of Roman historical relief sculpture, with particular interest in state panel reliefs and monuments such as the Column of Trajan. A series of studies of Roman state art appeared in the pages of the Bonner Jahrb√ºcher beginning in 1969. His inquiries focused not only on iconography and its intricacies, but also the narrative technique of the Roman artist. He also co- authored a volume on Roman souvenirs and the material culture of ancient tourism. A photograph of him dressed as the Flamen Dialis was published in The World of Roman Costume.Judith Lynn Sebesta, Larissa Bonfante (1994) The World of Roman Costume p. 216, fig. 13.4.

Dombrovsky fell foul of the authorities as early as 1932, for his part in the student suicide case described in The Faculty of Useless Knowledge. He was exiled to Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan where he established himself as a teacher, and which provided the setting for his novel The Keeper of Antiquities. This work, translated into English by Michael Glenny, gives several ominous hints as to the development of the Stalinist terror and its impact in remote Alma-Ata. Dombrovsky had begun publishing literary articles in Kazakhstanskaya Pravda by 1937, when he was imprisoned again ‚Äî this time for a mere seven months, having the luck to be detained during the partial hiatus between the downfall of Yezhov and the appointment of Beria. Dombrovsky's first novel Derzhavin was published in 1938 and he was accepted into the Union of Soviet Writers in 1939, the year in which he was arrested yet again. This time he was sent to the notorious Kolyma camps in northeast Siberia, of which we are given brief but chilling glimpses in The Faculty of Useless Knowledge. Dombrovsky, partially paralysed, was released from the camps in 1943 and lived as a teacher in Alma-Ata until 1949. There he wrote The Monkey Comes for his Skull and The Dark Lady. In 1949, he was again arrested, this time in connection with the campaign against foreign influences and cosmopolitanism. This time, he received a ten-year sentence, to be served in the Tayshet and Osetrovo regions in Siberia. In 1955, he was released and fully rehabilitated the following year. Until his death in 1978, he lived in Moscow with Klara Fazulayevna (a character in The Faculty of Useless Knowledge). He was allowed to write, and his works were translated abroad, but none of them were re-issued in the USSR. Nor was he allowed abroad, even to Poland. The Faculty of Useless Knowledge (Harvill), translated by Alan Myers the sombre and chilling sequel to The Keeper of Antiquities took eleven years to write, and was published in Paris in 1978. A widespread opinion is that this publication proved fatal. The KGB did not approve of the work, and it was noted that the book had actually been finished in 1975. Dombrovsky received numerous threats over the phone and through the post; his arm was shattered by a steel pipe in the course of an assault on a bus, and he was finally brutally beaten by a group of unknown persons in the lobby of the restaurant of the Central House of Writers in Moscow. Two months after the incident, on May 29, 1978 he died in hospital from severe internal bleeding caused by varicose veins of the digestive system. An account about Dombrovsky written by Armand Maloumian, a fellow inmate of the GULAG, can be found in Kontinent 4: Contemporary Russian Writers (Avon Books, ed. George Bailey), entitled \\"And Even Our Tears.\\" Jean-Paul Sartre described Yuri Dombrovsky as the last classic. == Bibliography == * 1939: Derzhavin (Alma-Ata: Kazakhstanskoe izdatel‚Äôstvo khudozhestvennnoi literatury, 1939) * 1943: Obez'iana prikhodit za svoim cherepom [The Ape is coming to pick up its Skull] (Moscow: Sovetsky pisatel‚Äô, 1959) * 1964: Khranitel' drevnostei [The Keeper of Antiquities] (Novyi mir magazine 1964, No 7-8). ** The Keeper of Antiquities (M.

Morgion was formed in 1990 by Dwayne Boardman (guitars), Jeremy Peto (vocals, bass) and Rhett Davis (drums). The band recorded their debut ‚ÄúRabid Decay‚Äù demo in 1991, followed by the ‚ÄúTravesty‚Äù 7\\" in 1993. With the addition of Bobby Thomas (guitars) and Ed Parker (keyboards) in 1994, Morgion recorded a what would become ‚ÄúAmong Majestic Ruin‚Äù, licensed for release to Relapse Records in 1997. In 1995, Gary Griffith joined Morgion as a replacement for Parker on keyboards. In 1998, Thomas departed and Griffith took on both guitar and keyboard duties. Morgion then wrote and recorded Solinari; released by Relapse Records in 1999. After a hiatus, 2002 saw the band moving forward with Justin Christian on Bass and an album partnership with Dark Symphonies. ‚ÄúCloaked by Ages, Crowned in Earth‚Äù, the final album, was released in April 2004. Boardman and Griffith left Morgion in 2004, and the band was officially put to rest after the drummer and bassist briefly attempted to carry on and tour under the Morgion name. On April 19, 2008, former members Boardman (vocals/guitars), Christian (bass), Griffith (cocals/guitars/keyboards) and Surowski (drums) played a short Morgion set at the Murderfest in Hollywood, California to commemorate the release of Relapse Records' \\"Morgion: The Relapse Years.\\" The appearance was planned to be the Solinari lineup, but a fallout between members changed plans. The Relapse release contains the recordings \\"Among Majestic Ruin\\" and Solinari, along with previously unreleased songs, demos and rehearsal tracks from the Relapse era, all remastered February 2008 by Griffith and Mathais Schneeburger (whom co- produced the albums Solinari and \\"Cloaked by Ages, Crowned in Earth\\"). A compilation of early demo recordings entitled \\"God of Death & Disease\\" was released in 2012 by Dark Descent Records. The original Solinari lineup was invited to play a one-off \\"reunion\\" gig at Maryland Deathfest in 2012, but the bassist sustained an arm injury that forced the band to reschedule the show for the following year. Just a few short months before they were set to appear at Maryland Deathfest 2013, the lineup once again suffered a fallout between members and they were forced to cancel their appearance. ==Facts== Morgion is also the name of the god of plague and disease in the world of Dragonlance, coinciding with their debut Rabid Decay and is where the band took their name from. Their album Solinari is also named after a god in the Dragonlance world, Solinari, as a god of magic and ruler of those who wear the white robes. Rhett Davis (lyrics and titles), not knowing his Dragonlance lore very well, stated that Solinari was the black moon in Dragonlance lore, but Solinari is in fact the name of the white moon. 'Nuitari' is the name of the black moon and, given the album artwork, is likely Solinaris' true intended album title. ==Members== ===Final line-up=== *Dwayne Boardman - Death Vocals, Guitars (1990‚Äì2001, 2002‚Äì2004) *Gary Griffith - Guitars, Clean Vocals, Keyboards (1995‚Äì2004) *Justin Christian - Bass (2002‚Äì2004) *Rhett Davis - Drums (1990‚Äì1999, 2001‚Äì2004) ===Former members=== *Jeremy Peto - Death Vocals, Bass (1990-2001) *Bobby Thomas - Guitar (1994-1996) *Ed Parker - Keyboards (1994-1995) *Mike Davis - Guitar (1990-1993) *Brandon Livingston - Keyboards (1999; died 1999) *Peter Surowski - Keyboards (2001-2002) *Adrian Leroux - Clean Vocals, Death Vocals (2003) ===Timeline=== ImageSize =width:800 height:auto barincrement:25 PlotArea =left:120 bottom:80 top:0 right:15 Alignbars =justify DateFormat =mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/2004 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1990 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1990 TimeAxis =orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend =orientation:vertical position:bottom Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_Albums id:other value:gray(0.5) legend:Demos/EPs id:bars value:gray(0.95) LineData= at:06/01/1991 color:other layer:back at:06/01/1992 color:other layer:back at:03/01/1993 color:other layer:back at:03/28/1997 color:black layer:back at:02/23/1999 color:black layer:back at:10/01/1999 color:other layer:back at:06/01/2002 color:other layer:back at:12/01/2002 color:other layer:back at:06/01/2003 color:other layer:back at:04/27/2004 color:black layer:back BackgroundColors= bars:bars BarData= bar:Dwayne text:\\"Dwayne Boardman\\" bar:Gary text:\\"Gary Griffith\\" bar:Jeremy text:\\"Jeremy Peto\\" bar:Rhett text:\\"Rhett Davis\\" bar:Mike text:\\"Mike Davis\\" bar:Bobby text:\\"Bobby Thomas\\" bar:Ed text:\\"Ed Parker\\" bar:Adrian text:\\"Adrian Leroux\\" bar:Brandon text:\\"Brandon Livingston\\" bar:Peter text:\\"Peter Surowski\\" bar:Justin text:\\"Justin Christian\\" PlotData = width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Adrian from:01/01/2003 till:04/01/2003 color:vocals bar:Dwayne from:01/01/1990 till:09/11/2001 color:guitar bar:Dwayne from:11/01/2001 till:04/01/2004 color:guitar bar:Dwayne from:05/01/2003 till:04/01/2004 color:vocals width:3 bar:Mike from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/1993 color:guitar bar:Bobby from:01/01/1994 till:06/01/1996 color:guitar bar:Gary from:06/01/1995 till:06/01/1998 color:keys bar:Gary from:06/01/1998 till:04/01/2004 color:guitar bar:Gary from:05/01/2003 till:04/01/2004 color:vocals width:7 bar:Gary from:06/01/1998 till:04/01/2004 color:keys width:3 bar:Ed from:01/01/1994 till:01/01/1995 color:keys bar:Brandon from:05/01/1999 till:09/01/1999 color:keys bar:Peter from:01/01/2001 till:04/01/2002 color:keys bar:Jeremy from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/2001 color:bass bar:Jeremy from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/2001 color:vocals width:3 bar:Justin from:01/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:bass bar:Rhett from:01/01/1990 till:06/01/1999 color:drums bar:Rhett from:06/01/2001 till:12/01/2004 color:drums ==Discography== * Rabid Decay (1991) * Travesty (1993) * Among Majestic Ruin (1997) * Solinari (1999) * Cloaked by Ages, Crowned in Earth (2004) * Morgion: The Relapse Years (2008) * Morgion: God of Death & Disease (2012) ==External links== * Official Dark Symphonies website (Former Label) * Official Relapse website (Former Label) Category:Heavy metal musical groups from California Category:American doom metal musical groups Category:Relapse Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2004 Category:Musical quartets Category:Musical groups from Orange County, California ","title":"Morgion (band)"},{"id":"3258411","text":"{ } USS Lewis Hancock (DD-675) was a Fletcher-class destroyer of the United States Navy, named for Lieutenant Commander Lewis Hancock, Jr. (1889-1925). Lewis Hancock was laid down 31 March 1943 by Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Kearny, N.J.; launched 1 August; sponsored by Lt. Joy Hancock, USNR, widow of Lieutenant Commander Hancock, and the first Wave officer to christen a U.S. combatant ship; and commissioned 29 September 1943, Comdr. Charles H. Lyman III in command. == World War II == Following shakedown out of Bermuda, Lewis Hancock in company with Langley (CVL-27) sailed from New York 6 December for the Pacific; arrived Pearl Harbor on Christmas Day 1943; and joined Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher‚Äôs Fast Carrier Task Force (then 5th Fleet's TF 58, later 3rd Fleet's TF 38), a mighty naval weapon organized to neutralize Japanese airpower and forward bases in advance of leapfrogging American amphibious operations. On 16 January 1944 Lewis Hancock sortied from Pearl Harbor with Task Group 58.2 (TG 58.2) for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. Assigned the task of neutralizing enemy airpower on Kwajalein Atoll, the flattops in Lewis Hancock‚Äôs group smashed the airdrome at Roi on the 29th, destroying every Japanese plane. The next day a second carrier strike hit defensive positions softening enemy emplacements in preparation for landings on the 31st. For the next 3 days planes from the carriers provided close tactical support for the marines who wrested the atoll from the Japanese Emperor. The destroyer returned to Majuro Logoon on the 4th. The destroyer accompanied the task force on the first strike against Truk, the major Japanese naval base in the Central Pacific, 16 and 17 February. In this operation Mitscher‚Äôs ships and planes destroyed several enemy warships, some 200,000 tons of merchant shipping, and about 275 planes. Lewis Hancock departed the Hawaiian Islands 15 March for 5 months of action in the forward areas. After rejoining TG 58.2, she screened the heavies during a strike on the Palaus late in March and during the capture of Hollandia in April. In May they hit the Marcus-Wake area. On 11 June planes of the task force began the softening-up process against Saipan, Tinian, Guam, and other islands of the Marianas. Normally assigned antiaircraft and antisubmarine duties. Lewis Hancock also bombarded Saipan on the 13th. The Japanese attempted to counter the American thrust, into the Marianas by striking at the invading task force with their full naval strength. The U.S. carriers, guarded by Lewis Hancock, smashed the enemy fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea 19 and 20 June, and thus saved the forces which were conquering the Marianas. Thereafter, the giant flattops continued to support operations in the Marianas and in July raided the Bonins and the Palaus. Following 2 weeks at Pearl Harbor, Lewis Hancock joined TF 38\\\\. Attacks on airstrips in the Philippines, Okinawa, and Formosa followed in rapid succession. On 13 September, during her first raid against the Philippines, Lewis Hancock splashed her first enemy plane. These airstrikes helped to neutralize Japan‚Äôs airpower and soften up her defenses for General Douglas MacArthur‚Äôs long-awaited return to the Philippines. The U.S. troops landed on the beaches of Leyte, and Japan struck back with her full fleet in effort to stem the American advance. In the ensuing Battle of Leyte Gulf, while acting as a picket ship, Lewis Hancock assisted in sinking an enemy destroyer. Joining the 5th Fleet in February 1945, she participated in a series of raids against the Japanese home islands striking Tokyo on the 16th and 25th and the Kobe-Osaka area 19 March. During the later raid, DD-675 splashed her final enemy planes, numbers 5 and 6. On 1 April the Navy placed the American flag on the doorstep of Japan with the landings on Okinawa. Lewis Hancock supported the struggle for that bitterly contested island until heading for home 10 May. Miraculously undamaged and having suffered only four casualties during 16 months in the Pacific, this veteran steamed into San Francisco 6 July. Released from drydock overhaul 30 August, Lewis Hancock was girding herself to return to the war when the Japanese surrendered. She arrived San Diego 7 September and decommissioned 10 January 1946. Hugh Joseph Hannity, the father of political commentator and author, Sean Patrick Hannity, served on Lewis Hancock from 1943 to 1946, with a final rate of radarman third class. == 1951 - 1957 == The Korean War ended her retirement. On Armed Forces Day, 19 May 1951, she recommissioned at the Naval Station, Long Beach, Calif., Comdr. R. L. Tully in command. On 11 October she departed San Diego for the east coast and arrived Newport, R.I. on the 27th for modernization. Lewis Hancock departed Newport under the command of Cmdr Myron Alpert 6 September 1952, sailed through the Panama Canal, and reached Yokosuka, Japan 20 October. After additional training, she entered Korean waters early in December. Following brief service on the east coast of Korea, she steamed to the embattled peninsula‚Äôs west coast 18 December and operated with the carrier for the remainder of the year. This Far Eastern deployment ended late in January 1953 when she departed Tokyo Bay for Newport via Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean. Her arrival at Newport completed a circumnavigation of the world. Lewis Hancock now began a pattern of service alternating operations along the east coast with European deployments. In October she sailed for 4 months in European waters. She sailed for home 24 January 1954 and operated along the Atlantic coast until heading back toward Europe in May 1955 for 4 months of joint operations with the British Home Fleet and operations with the Spanish Navy, before returning to Newport late in August. The destroyer operated in the western Atlantic until the rising tension in the Middle East called her back to the volatile Mediterranean. The destroyer got underway 15 April 1956, transited the Suez Canal 9 May and operated in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. She returned to the Mediterranean, one of the last ships to pass through the Suez Canal before it closed, and arrived home 14 August. Following a period of refresher training and plane guard duty, Lewis Hancock departed Newport 6 May 1957, again heading east. In between 6th Fleet exercises the destroyer operated for 5 weeks in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean. Lewis Hancock concluded this last foreign cruise at Newport 31 August. She arrived at Philadelphia 24 September, decommissioned there 18 December 1957, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. == CT Piaui (D 31) == Brought out of mothballs and modernized, Lewis Hancock was transferred to the government of Brazil on 1 August 1967, and was commissioned on the same day in the Brazilian Navy as CT Piaui (D 31).

Nominally an army general, he lived the life of a reckless and spoiled playboy like his friend and sometime brother- in-law Porfirio Rubirosa. Remembered for his ruthlessness and cruelty, he went into exile in Spain, where he died after crashing a sports car. ==Early life== Ramfis Bridge, named in honor of not yet 5-year-old Ramfis Trujillo. Ramfis was born in 1929, his mother was Mar√≠a de los Angeles Mart√≠nez Alba, nicknamed La Espa√±olita \\"the Spaniard\\" as her parents were from Spain. By the age 14, his father Rafael Trujillo had made him a colonel, with equivalent pay and privileges. Some say he received this appointment aged just four and that he had become a brigadier general by the age of nine. He was nicknamed Ramfis after the high priest in Aida. In the early 1950s, he married his first wife, Octavia Ricart, they had six children. In the mid-1950s, he was sent to study at the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. While there, and with Rubirosa as his liaison, Trujillo skipped class and took off for Hollywood, eventually embarking on an affair with actress Kim Novak. Trujillo became notorious for buying luxury cars, mink coats, and jewelry for beautiful girls during his stay. Trujillo's flashy gift-giving made the national news and members of the United States Congress were openly questioned by the press about what real use was being made of foreign aid given to the Dominican Republic. At one point a bumper sticker began appearing on the cars of girls in Los Angeles that read: \\"THIS CAR WAS NOT A GIFT FROM RAMFIS TRUJILLO\\". Since his attendance at the military school was erratic at best, he was denied his diploma after completion. This fact greatly infuriated, and at the same time, humiliated his father. When he returned home, his wife Octavia filed for divorce. His unruly behavior, including gang rapes of young women and frivolously ordering murders, forced his father to send him to a sanatorium in Belgium. Trujillo apparently suffered from psychological problems, possibly the result of the pressure that his father constantly placed on him, as he intended to remake his son into an image of himself. Dominican historian Bernardo Vega has documented Trujillo's history of mental hospital stays, and Robert Crassweller also wrote about it in his Trujillo's biography. Trujillo received electroshock treatments in Belgium as early as 1958; there were also stays in mental hospitals after that. Not long after all this, he moved to Paris to resume his socialite lifestyle. Many of these actions have most historians convinced that Trujillo never wanted to be a ruler like his father and that he just wanted to live the carefree and bon vivant life of a playboy, shunning any sort of responsibility. Lita Milan (n√©e Iris Lia Menshell) became his second official wife during these years. She was an American of Hungarian immigrant parents, who had a short but relatively successful film career in Hollywood, most notably in The Left Handed Gun, opposite Paul Newman. Because of her black hair and dark good looks, Milan was often cast as Latino and Native American girls. They had two children. ==Influential years== On 30 May 1961, his father was assassinated in a plot to end the 31-year-long dictatorial regime. Trujillo quickly returned to the country and, with the help of Johnny Abbes Garc√≠a, the ruthless intelligence chief, brutally repressed any elements believed to be connected with his father's death, murdering many of the suspects himself. However, soon afterward, he and puppet president Joaqu√≠n Balaguer took some steps to open up the regime. Trujillo eased his father's harsh censorship of the press, and also granted some civil liberties. While these were rejected as insufficient by a people who had memories only of the Trujillo era and the decades of poverty and instability which had preceded it (for example: 1902-1905 bankruptcy, 1911 Civil War, 1914 political deadlock and threat of U.S. invasion, 1916-1924 U.S. occupation),Dominican Republic even these meager reforms were opposed by the hardliners gathered around Ramfis' uncles. Both internal and external pressures forced him into exile late in 1961, when he fled back to France, along with all of the surviving Trujillos, aboard the famed yacht Angelita (still sailing today as the cruise ship Sea Cloud), with his father's casket, which was allegedly lined with $4 million in cash, jewels and important papers. In 1962, he settled down in Spain where he was protected by Generalisimo Francisco Franco. There he continued with his jet-set lifestyle, which included flying planes as a hobby (also one of the passions of Rubirosa). He died on 27 December 1969, in Spain, from pneumonia, in a hospital after being severely injured in a car accident, a fate similar to Rubirosa's, 11 days earlier in the outskirts of Madrid. The person in the car he hit, Teresa Bertr√°n de Lis, the Duchess-consort of Alburquerque, died instantly. Trujillo was initially buried in Madrid's Almudena cemetery, but his remains were subsequently moved to Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo to accompany his father's remains. Trujillo was driving at the time of the accident a Ferrari 330GT sports car (s/n 9151), a blue 2-door purchased in 1966. The car has sat unrestored in Spain since 1969 and finally was offered for sale in early 2013 for ¬£50,000. Ramfis Trujillo's children and grandchildren are still alive, some of them living in Spain. ==ReferencesGlamour Girls of the Silver Screen ‚Äì Ramfis Trujillo * Guarding the Heir ‚Äì TIME Magazine * Lita Milan ‚Äì www.imdb.com * Ramfis in Power ‚Äì TIME Magazine * \\"La M√¥me Moineau\\" by Michel Ferracci-Porri. 2006.Editions Normant * \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\", novel by Mario Vargas Llosa. 2000 :es:La Fiesta del Chivo Category:1929 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Rafael Trujillo Category:Road incident deaths in Spain Category:Dominican Republic anti-communists Category:Dominican Republic exiles Category:Non-U.S. alumni of the Command and General Staff College Category:Dominican Republic military personnel Category:Dominican Republic people of Spanish descent Category:Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"Ramfis Trujillo"},{"id":"3258450","text":"Ryan Edwin Diem (born July 1, 1979) is a former American football offensive lineman who played his entire professional career for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League.

The circle sometimes considered to be a \\"Uthaya Suriyan\\" (rising sun) which is a symbol of Sri Lankan Tamils and earlier political movements. The LTTE leader was often compared to Pandara Vanniyan of Vannimai, because both had a similar fate.

The yellow signifies that Tamils' aspiration to freely govern themselves in their own homeland is a fundamental political and human right. The colour expresses the righteousness of Tamil struggle and reinforces Tamil Nation's will to uphold moral highground during its path towards freedom. The red represents the realisation that freedom is not complete by establishment of a separate state of Tamil Eelam. Distinctions of caste and class should be abolished. Egalitarianism should become their spiritual principle. Gender equality should permeate Tamil society. The revolutionary changes necessary to spread social justice represented by these principles are reflected by this colour. The black reminds that march towards freedom is wrought with dangers, death and destruction, that is filled with pain and misery.

After his military service, from 1942-1945 in the Kremlin guard, he began his serious literary career, and in 1951 graduated from the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. From 1958-1981, he worked in the editorial offices of the prominent newspaper Molodaya Gvardiya (Young Guard) and in the literary journal Nash Sovremennik (Our Contemporary). In articles he published during the second half of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, he manifested himself as a Russian patriot, and stressed the need to preserve national traditions; pondering the ways to develop the Russian arts. His journalistic expressions of opinion during the later years of perestroika idealized pre-revolutionary Russia. In his article \\"Reading Lenin\\",Original text available here Soloukhin was one of the first in Russia to publicly ask for revising the role of Lenin in the history of Russia. At that time, a thesis was popular (and, indeed, was furthered by the authorities), claiming that the crimes of the Stalinist era were a result of \\"violating Leninist principles\\", whereas Soloukhin interpreted Stalinism as the logical consequence of Lenin's policies. The main theme of Soloukhin's work is the Russian countryside, its present and future. His works strives to demonstrate the necessity of preserving the national traditions, and ponders the ways to further develop ethnic Russian art. Vladimir Soloukhin is considered to be a leading figure of the \\"village prose\\" group of writers. In 1975, the journal Moskva published his autobiographical story ‚ÄúVerdict‚Äù (¬´–ü—Ä–∏–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä¬ª), where the protagonist is diagnosed with cancer and undergoes surgical operation; in essence the author is describing thoughts of a person who has received death sentence. The whole edition was bought in two days.\\"Vladimir Soloukhin, Prigovor\\" Within his works, autobiographical prose takes a distinct position, where the author reflects on the history of Russia during the 20th century. Soloukhin represents Orthodox Christian - nationalist positions, criticizing atheist, internationalist, liberal and communist views. Soloukhin's book \\"Searching for Icons in Russia\\" describes his hobby of collecting icons. He traveled throughout the countryside in the 1950s and 1960s searching for icons. In some instances he discovered beautiful 16th century icons underneath layers of grime and over-painting yet he also finds ancient icons chopped into bits and rotting away. He was known for his campaign to preserve prerevolutionary Russian art and architecture. Ilya Glazunov painted a portrait of him. He died on 4 April 1997 in Moscow and was buried in his native village. ==References== ==External links== *Vladimir Soloukhin poems *sovlit.net - Encyclopedia of Soviet Writers *Russian-language biography *Moscow Gorky Literary Institute Category:1924 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Sobinsky District Category:Russian male poets Category:Soviet novelists Category:Soviet male writers Category:20th-century Russian male writers Category:Russian architecture writers Category:Soviet short story writers Category:20th-century Russian short story writers Category:20th-century poets Category:Russian male novelists Category:Russian male short story writers ","title":"Vladimir Soloukhin"},{"id":"3258523","text":"Emeline Hurd Hill Richardson (June 6, 1910 in Buffalo, New York, USA ‚Äì August 29, 1999 in Durham, North Carolina) was a notable classical archaeologist and Etruscan scholar.

Jaja earned his way out of slavery; he was enculturated according to Ijaw (Ibani) rituals and rose to head the Anna Pepple House merchant faction of Bonny Island. Under him, Anna Pepple absorbed other trade houses until a dispute with the Manilla Pepple House led by Oko Jumbo compelled Jaja to break away to form the Opobo city- state (26 miles east of Bonny) in 1869. Opobo came to dominate the region's palm oil trade, and controlled fourteen of what were formerly Bonny's eighteen trade houses. Jaja blocked the access of British merchants to the interior effectively monopolizing trade; Opobo also shipped palm oil directly to Liverpool, independent of British middlemen. At the 1884 Berlin Conference the Europeans designated Opobo as British territory. When Jaja refused to cease taxing the British traders, Henry Hamilton Johnston, a British vice consul, invited Jaja for negotiations in 1887.

He is of Hungarian origin. Tamas has worked for Dagens Nyheter, Sweden's leading daily newspaper, and as a journalist for TV4. Tamas is mostly known for his 2002 book Lasermannen ‚Äì en ber√§ttelse om Sverige (The Laser Man ‚Äì A story about Sweden). The book is about the life John Ausonius, a killer who shot people with foreign backgrounds, first with a rifle with a laser sight in Stockholm in the winter of 1991 and with a revolver caliber 38 in the spring of 1992. The book became a bestseller and was adapted into a mini TV- series for SVT in 2005. In 2017, Nya Tider published an article criticizing Gellert Tamas for having intentionally character assassinated psychiatrist Thomas Jackson after he stated that the apathetic children were victims of coerced child abuse. On April 4, 2019, Gellert Tamas threatened to sue the paper Expressen after they published a Facebook post of reporter and author Lawen Mohtadi where she, after working together, criticizes Tamas of being a \\"bully, a sexist and a narcissist with an enflated self image who was of the opinion that others should be greatful to work with him\\". On August 16, 2019, the independent media examiner Magasin Filter criticized Tamas for refusing to answer questions regarding his publications on the apathetic children and instead attacking a straw man. Thomas Jackson responded positively on the critique and wrote that Tamas was \\"a parasitical psychopath who lied the public about the truth of the apathetic refugee children\\". == Criticism == On October, 2006, Marie Hessle, state executive, and Nader Ahmadi, research leader, heads of the Swedish National Coordinator for Children in the Asylum Process with Resignation syndrom (\\"den nationella samordnaren f√∂r barn i asylprocessen med uppgivenhetssymtom\\"), reported the episode of Uppdrag Gransknings show \\"Spelet med de apatiska flyktingbarnen\\" (The toying of apathetic refugee children) for having intentionally distorted the commentary of the government officials. Gellert Tamas was reported for having twisted psychiatrist Thomas Jackson's and doctor Thomas Eriksson's commentary of simulation being a possible reason to \\"being the main reason for the asylum seeking children\\". The report contains 24 points which was send to Granskningsn√§mnden f√∂r radio och TV (The investigation committee for radio and TV). Tamas book \\"The Apathetic\\" (De Apatiska) was criticized by Swedish doctor and associate professor Tomas J Eriksson stating that Tamas had failed to discuss why there was an increase from zero to 400 within a few years and why it decreased again. He also stated that Tamas had failed to explain why the condition only happened amongst children where the asylum process had not yet been granted and why the condition never occurred amongst unaccompanied children but only amongst children with families. Tamas also never discussed why the phenomena only occurred amongst children from former Yugoslav and Soviet republics. Eriksson also questions why Tamas does not explain how this never happens amongst Swedish children who are under severe pressure. Eriksson had treated many refugee children and stated that the children were either poisoned or manipulated. Peter Engels√∂y, deputy head and chief physician, stated in an article published by Aftonbladet that Gellert Tamas bok was full of incorrect statements and that Tamas had used character assassination on Engels√∂y. The heads of the Swedish agency for child- and youth psychiatry (Barn- och ungdomspsykiatrin) criticized Tamas in an article published by Aftonbladet stating that Tamas was spreading rumors about the psychiatrists alleged incompetence in treating apathetic children. The criticism was that the psychiatrists could not solely base their clinical diagnosis on Tamas publications without the risk of encouraging child abuse. An article in Dagens Nyheter stated that Tamas credibility can be questioned. Psychiatrist Thomas Jackson, who was the elected government expert of the investigation, stated in lectures for health care staff and in his publications that Tamas book was dangerous for apathetic refugee children as he had spread rumors that the national agencies had in turn spread rumors that the children were simulating. According to an article published by DTMedia, reporters Gellert Tamas and Janne Josefsson did not listen to the criteria for forced simulation which Jackson presented in his participation on Uppdrag Granskning. == References == ==External links== *Gellers etik Category:Swedish journalists Category:Swedish male writers Category:Swedish people of Hungarian descent Category:1963 births Category:Living people ","title":"Gellert Tamas"},{"id":"3258531","text":"George H.

He served as the 5th and 7th Mayor of Milwaukee, and represented Milwaukee in the Wisconsin State Assembly and its predecessor body in the Wisconsin Territory. His younger brother, Isaac P. Walker, was one of the first two men elected to the United States Senate from Wisconsin. ==Biography== Walker was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and moved with his family to Illinois in 1825. The fur trade brought him to the vicinity of the Milwaukee River in 1833, and, on March 20, 1834, he established himself on the south bank of the river. In June 1835, he founded the settlement of Walker's Point and established a fur trading post. In 1846, Walker's settlement combined with two rival villages - Solomon Juneau's Juneautown (present-day East Town) and Byron Kilbourn's Kilbourntown (present-day Westown) - to incorporate the City of Milwaukee. Warehouse District in Walker's Point Land that belonged to Walker is now part of the Walker's Point Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Walker served in the first three sessions of the 4th Legislative Assembly of the Wisconsin Territory, serving from 1842-1845, and was speaker for the 2nd and 3rd sessions. He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1850, serving in the 3rd Wisconsin Legislature. Walker also served as the city's supervisor, register of the land office, alderman, and as mayor in 1851 and 1853.

They recorded three albums and several EPs, the best known of which is The Venus Trail (1993). They achieved commercial and critical success worldwide in the period between 1992 and 1995. ==History== The band was formed in May 1988 by Dominic Stones, Denise Roughan and David Saunders. The band's name refers to the members' names all starting with \\"D\\". In 1989, they were joined by David Mitchell, who introduced the twin-guitar attack which became the defining feature of the group. He also made some of the cover of the albums. Among their inspirations, in addition to the Pixies, they also consider Black Sabbath and Fairport Convention to be inspirations. Their first recordings were demos, one of which, \\"Meluzina Man\\", became their first release on the 1990 compilation Xpressway Pileup. The band's first release for the Flying Nun label was the EP Fish Tales at the beginning of 1990, beginning a long collaboration with the label in Dunedin. Their second EP, Swarthy Songs for Swabs, and the first album, Hellzapoppin', were released over the next two years. The first tour in the United States was in 1992, followed by an Australian tour with the Lemonheads. In 1992, the band played with Nirvana in New Zealand. Their second album was The Venus Trail, released in 1993. This included their best known singles \\"Hey Seuss\\" and \\"Beautiful Things.\\" In 1994, they returned to the U.S. for a three-month tour. The 3Ds toured with Pavement in New Zealand and Australia. Following this, The 3Ds played two stadium shows supporting U2 on their Zoo TV tour in New Zealand. An associate of the band took a bottle of wine from U2's dressing room without permission, leading the concert promoter to inform The 3Ds that they would not be paid for their performance. However, Bono was in the room at the time and insisted that The 3Ds be paid double, and given an additional bottle of wine. In 1997, the band released its third album, Strange News from the Angels. The band announced it was splitting up in early 1997. In July 2009, the 3Ds reformed to play two shows at the Merge Records 20th anniversary festival in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In 2010, the 3Ds toured New Zealand, including the inaugural Laneways festival. This was followed by an invitation to play at the Pavement- curated All Tomorrows Parties festival in the UK. ==Discography== ===Albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Details !

Published in 1904, it is a collection of articles which Steffens had written for McClure‚Äôs Magazine.Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 1. It reports on the workings of corrupt political machines in several major U.S. cities, along with a few efforts to combat them. It is considered one of several early major pieces of muckraking journalism, though Steffens later claimed that this work made him \\"the first muckraker.\\"Robert B. Downs, Books that Changed America (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970), 132. Though Steffens' subject was municipal corruption, he did not present his work as an expos√© of corruption; rather, he wanted to draw attention to the public's complicity in allowing corruption to continue. Steffens tried to advance a theory of city corruption: corruption, he claimed, was the result of \\"big business men\\" who corrupted city government for their own ends, and \\"the typical business man\\"‚Äîaverage Americans‚Äîwho ignored politics and allowed such corruption to continue. He framed his work as an attempt \\"to sound for the civic pride of an apparently shameless citizenship,\\" by making the public face their responsibility in the persistence of municipal corruption.Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 9, 3, 1. ==Background== Steffens began working on the articles that would become The Shame of the Cities after he joined the staff of McClure's in 1901. He had been hired as a managing editor for the magazine, but, as Steffens biographers note, he struggled with the job.Robert B. Downs, Books that Changed America (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970), 133; Patrick F. Palermo, Lincoln Steffens (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1978), 37. Steffens writes that S. S. McClure, the magazine's co- founder, sent him on an open-ended assignment to learn how to become an editor. According to Steffens, McClure said, \\"Get out of here, travel, go‚Äîsomewhere. Go out in the advertising department. Ask them where they have transportation credit. Buy a railroad ticket, get on a train, and there, where it lands you, there you will learn to edit a magazine.\\"Lincoln Steffens, The Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1931), 364. After setting out in the spring of 1902, Steffens learned of and arranged a meeting with Joseph W. Folk, the recently elected circuit attorney of St. Louis.Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 103. Folk had been elected thanks to a temporary alliance between a business-backed reform movement and Edward Butler, the boss of the city's Democratic Party machine; Butler allied with the reformers, in part, to help get his son elected to Congress.Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 105. After his election, though, Folk launched a massive investigation into the city's corruption, arresting many prominent St. Louis legislators and businessmen, while scaring others into fleeing the state‚Äîand, in some cases, fleeing the country.Robert B. Downs, Books that Changed America (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970), 135. Steffens was not the first author of \\"Tweed Days in St. Louis\\", the McClure‚Äôs piece detailing Folk's investigation of Butler's machine; he initially commissioned Claude Wetmore, a St. Louis author, to write the piece. Wetmore, according to Steffens biographer Justin Kaplan, \\"was an honest reporter, but he happened to live in St. Louis and he wanted to continue to live there. And so Wetmore steered a middle course, left out crucial names and facts, went easy on prominent citizens went easy even on Butler, who was to come to trial that summer\\".Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 106. Steffens rewrote the article from scratch, adding all of the details Wetmore had left out; Wetmore, in turn, insisted that Steffens sign the article as well, so that he too would be targeted when St. Louis citizens accused them of slander.Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 105-106. Steffens' next assignment was in Minneapolis. He claimed that McClure tried to take editorial control of his story. According to Steffens, before he left for Minneapolis, McClure told him that his next article would \\"point out that democracy is at fault [for urban corruption], that one man has to run a city just as one man has to run a business to make it a success. ‚Ä¶We had a pretty hot fight, and McClure won. What I went to Minneapolis to write about was that democracy was a failure and that a good dictator was what is needed.\\"Lincoln Steffens, The Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1931), 374. McClure had also been concerned by the anti-business bias he perceived in \\"Tweed Days in St. Louis.Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 99; Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 109. In Minneapolis, Steffens discovered a massive system of graft headed by the mayor, Dr. Albert Alonzo Ames. He learned that the mayor and the police, consulting professional criminals for advice, had organized a citywide system to extract bribes from the city‚Äôs houses of prostitution, which were actually forbidden under city law, and its saloons.Lincoln Steffens, The Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1931), 376-377. He also obtained and publicized \\"The Big Mitt Ledger\\", an accounting book a group of card cheats used to record their winnings and the bribes they paid to city officials.Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 111. McClure and Steffens argued over what city to cover next: Steffens wanted to return to St. Louis, while McClure wanted Steffens to investigate Chicago. Chicago, McClure thought, would have even more corruption than Minneapolis, leading to even greater public interest and magazine sales. Ida Tarbell helped settle their dispute in Steffens' favor, and he returned to St. Louis to continue writing about Folk's efforts to clean up the city.Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 103. Steffens then received a request from the children of the late Jay Gould to investigate Pittsburgh, where, they claimed, they had evidence that the dominant political machines were conspiring to keep them out of the city's railroad business. Though the Goulds decided not to help Steffens after all once he arrived in the city, Steffens found a different ally: Oliver McClintock, a businessman who had spent years learning about the city's corruption on his own. Using McClintock's findings, Steffens published his article on Pittsburgh in the May 1903 issue of McClure's.Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 105. Steffens then traveled to Philadelphia. In his autobiography, Steffens notes that he expected Philadelphia to be like every other city he had visited, but that he was surprised by his findings there. The city government was still corrupt despite having been reformed; in fact, he found, the city's charter, known as the Bullitt Charter, centralized power in the mayor's office‚Äîa reform Steffens himself had suggested in the past. Because of his findings in Philadelphia, Steffens later wrote, he \\"had to note a‚Ä¶new and startling theory, viz.: that the form of government did not matter; that constitutions and charters did not affect essentially the actual government\\".Lincoln Steffens, The Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1931), 409. After finishing in Philadelphia, Steffens, at McClure's suggestion, went to Chicago, expecting to find sensational corruption. He did not find the story he anticipated. Instead, as he learned from talking to Chicago reformer Walter L. Fisher, Chicago reformers had waged a long campaign against corrupt politicians and had actually taken control of the city legislature. After his article about Chicago received a positive popular response, Steffens returned to New York to write a final article about good city governance.Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 108-109. When politicians backed by the Tammany Hall political machine won the New York elections of 1903, ousting the good government Steffens had praised, Steffens, feeling \\"all up in the air\\", traveled to Cos Cob, Connecticut, where he adapted these articles into The Shame of the Cities. McClure, Philips, and Co. first published the book in 1904.Lincoln Steffens, The Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1931), 434. ==Synopsis== Steffens' first article in The Shame of the Cities is \\"Tweed Days in St. Louis\\", published in October 1902. Steffens discusses Circuit Attorney Folk's efforts to clean up the city's corruption. Bribery, Steffens noted, had become commonplace in city government by the turn of the century. Responding to public concerns about corruption, the local Democratic Party put together a \\"reform\\" ticket, though this was \\"[s]imply part of the game\\", rather than out of a sincere desire to reform. Folk, however, took his duties seriously. He launched an investigation into the city's corruption after seeing a newspaper article which claimed that a bribe fund had been set up in a local bank to pay off city legislators who helped pass a streetcar bill. Folk found the bribe money in the bank, and began indicting participants in the bribery plot, leading a few of them to flee the state or the country. As he began to win convictions, other men involved in corruption decided to testify against their associates. Steffens concludes the article by claiming that \\"In all cities, the better classes‚Äîthe business men‚Äîare the sources of corruption\\"; Folk, he notes, \\"has shown St. Louis that its bankers, brokers, corporation officers,‚Äîits business men are the sources of evil\\". Furthermore, he warns, \\"what went on in St. Louis is going on in most of our cities, towns, and villages. The problem of municipal government in America has not been solved\\".Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 19, 23-24, 25, 27, 32-39, 40, 41. \\"The Shame of Minneapolis\\", published in January 1903, tells the story of Mayor \\"Doc\\" Ames. Steffens claims that Ames, on being elected mayor in 1900, \\"set out upon a career of corruption for which deliberateness, invention, and avarice has never been equaled\\". Ames and the complicit police force, in exchange for bribes, chose to ignore illegal gambling and prostitution. This arrangement attracted criminals to the city, many of whom arranged with the police to be left alone‚Äîaccording to Steffens, \\"the government of a city asked criminals to rob the people\\". The foreman of the city's grand jury, Hovey C. Clarke, was primarily responsible for breaking up the Ames machine. After being selected to the jury in April 1902, he and his colleagues paid several private detectives to investigate the machine. After the conviction of Ames' brother, Fred, Mayor Ames fled the state, and the city government was thrown into disarray. The new acting mayor, Alderman D. Percy Jones, replaced Ames' men on the police force with good officers Ames had fired. \\"Minneapolis should be clean and sweet for a little while at least\\", Steffens concluded.Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 42, 46-47, 51, 58-63, 65, 68. \\"The Shamelessness of St. Louis\\", Steffens' follow-up piece to \\"Tweed Days\\", asks: \\"Is democracy possible?‚Äù Though Clarke and Jones had cleaned up Minneapolis, St. Louis, Steffens proclaims, \\"is unmoved and unashamed. St. Louis seems to me to be something new in the history of the government of the people, by the rascals, for the rich\\". This article focuses on Edward R. \\"Boss\\" Butler, the Democratic Party boss who, Steffens claimed, was the real ruler of the city, even though St. Louis typically leaned Republican. Butler was a \\"boodler\\", one who sold for personal gain \\"the rights, privileges, franchises, and real property of the city\\" to prominent businessmen and corporations. The scale of their operation was vast, Steffens reported: \\"In St. Louis the regularly organized thieves who rule have sold $50,000,000 worth of franchises and other valuable municipal assets. This is the estimate made for me by a banker, who said that the boodler got not one-tenth the value of the things they sold, but were content because they got it all themselves\\". Steffens discusses new developments in Folk's investigation, especially Butler's trial and conviction. He notes that Folk's investigation is ongoing, but that the people of St. Louis were not roused to action by all of the corruption: few had registered to vote in the previous elections, and there had been no attempt to organize a reform ticket independent of the two main parties.Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 69, 70, 72-73, 74, 84, 93-94, 98. Steffens' next article, published in May 1903, was \\"Pittsburg: A City Ashamed\\". Steffens discusses the city's late boss, Christopher L. Magee, who, he concedes, \\"did not, technically speaking, rob the town. ‚Ä¶But surely he does not deserve a monument\\". Magee, reports Steffens, found a partner in William Flinn: \\"A happy, profitable combination, it lasted for life. Magee wanted power, Flinn wealth. ‚Ä¶Magee was the sower, Flinn the reaper\\". Together, McGee and Flinn took complete control of the city government, leading Steffens to claim \\"Tammany in comparison is a plaything\\". Because they controlled the city council, they were able to direct city contracts to their own businesses; Flinn's firm received virtually all of the city's paving contracts between 1887 and 1896, and Magee took control of the city's railway franchises, valued at $30,000,000. Though Pittsburgh citizens finally organized a Citizens' party to overthrow the machine in 1902, and won that year's election, Steffens reports that one of the party's committee members, Thomas Steele Bigelow, co-opted the party, attracted Magee and Flinn's former supporters, and became the city's new boss. Steffens notes that a new organization, the Voters' Civic League, has been organized the fight the new Bigelow machine, and comments that \\"the effort of Pittsburg, pitiful as it is, is a spectacle good for American self-respect, and its sturdiness is a promise for poor old Pennsylvania\\".Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 101, 104, 106, 115, 117-122, 130-132, 133. Steffens then wrote \\"Philadelphia: Corrupt and Contented\\", published in July 1903. Philadelphia, Steffens argues, is an important case for Americans to study, since its corruption in 1903 existed even after the city had reformed and adopted a new city charter in 1885. The Philadelphia machine, Steffens reports, \\"controls the whole process of voting, and practices fraud at every stage\\". He documents the abuses of Mayor Samuel H. Ashbridge, who, after he took office, allegedly told the city postmaster, \\"I shall get out of this office all there is in it for Samuel H. Ashbridge\\". Steffens notes at the end of this article that the city's new mayor, John Weaver, appears to be a good mayor: he had killed \\"macing\\" bills in the state legislature that would have allowed machine-connected companies to buy control of city water and power services. But, Steffens asks readers, \\"Why should he serve the people and not the ring?\\"Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 134, 136-137, 138, 152-153, 160-161, 161. Steffens' final two articles in this series discuss examples of comparatively good city government. The first is \\"Chicago: Half Free and Fighting On\\", published in October 1903. Chicago, Steffens says, is not yet \\"an example of good municipal government\\", but it nonetheless \\"should be celebrated among American cities for reform, real reform\\". He discusses the work of the Municipal Voters' League, a group formed by the Civic Federation and led by George C. Cole. Cole and his allies publicized corrupt aldermen's city council records and war records, or threatened to release more compromising records, to convince those candidates not to run for reelection. Over the course of several elections, the League finally achieved a nominal majority of its own candidates in the city government, but was unable to organize them into a unified faction, leading a discouraged Cole to quit his League work. The League's new secretary, Walter L. Fisher, has since taken a leadership role: Steffens terms him a \\"reform boss\\". Steffens is optimistic about the city's prospects for good government, and gives credit for this development primarily to Chicago's informed and engaged public. \\"The city of Chicago\\", he declares, \\"is ruled by the citizens of Chicago.\\"Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 191-192, 195, 199, 203, 205, 213, 215. The final article in the book, published just a month later, is \\"New York: Good Government to the Test\\". Unlike all of the other cities he has covered, Steffens notes, New York, under Mayor Seth Low, actually has a good administration: \\"for an American city, it has been not only honest, but able, undeniably one of the best in the whole country\\". Most of this article, however, deals not with Mayor Low, but with the politicians of Tammany Hall. Tammany machine rule, Steffens notes, is \\"corruption by consent\\", which it achieves through the largest system of graft Steffens had ever seen. As a New Yorker himself, Steffens expresses concern that Tammany politicians would undertake superficial reforms to regain power; they would offer the appearance of good government, while remaining corrupt and self-serving. He notes, \\"I don‚Äôt fear a bad Tammany mayor; I dread the election of a good one.\\" In the article's postscript, added for the book, he notes that the Tammany mayoral candidate had won in the recent city elections.Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 191-192, 195, 199, 203, 205, 213, 215. ==Major themes== Though Steffens' reporting did expose the broader public to examples of corruption in some major American cities, Steffens points out in The Shame of the Cities that exposing corruption was not his purpose. He writes in the introduction to the book that, to him, the most important new information in his work was not the evidence of corruption, but the evidence of the public's complicity in it: \\"The people are not innocent. That is the only 'news' in all the journalism of these articles\\". He tries to debunk popular explanations for city corruption. He notes that immigrants, who frequently received blame for spurring corruption, could not be responsible for Philadelphia's corruption, since \\"Philadelphia, with 47 percent. of its population native-born of native-born parents, is the most American of our greater cities\\". Steffens makes the point more forcefully in the introduction to the book. \\"But not one class is at fault, nor any one breed, not any particular interest or group of interests\\", he writes. \\"The misgovernment of the American people is misgovernment by the American people\\".Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 9, 135, 2. Steffens tried to show that corruption developed in the same way in different cities. Though the activities of different machines differed, Steffens found that all the machines shared a common origin: they began, according to Robert B. Downs, as \\"an alliance between 'respectable' businessmen and disreputable gang politicians to rob the taxpayers\\".Robert B. Downs, Books that Changed America (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970), 142. Though most people, Steffens concluded in \\"Tweed Days in St. Louis\\", \\"blame the politicians and the vicious and ignorant poor\\" for corruption, \\"In all cities, the better classes‚Äîthe business men‚Äîare the sources of corruption\\". Steffens clarifies this claim in the book's introduction; there, he specifically castigates the \\"big business man\\" as \\"the source of corruption\\", calling him \\"a self-righteous fraud\\".Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 40, 3. But Steffens also claims that \\"the good citizen, the typical business man\\" is partly responsible for city corruption, as he is too absorbed in his own affairs to worry much about politics. Throughout the book, Steffens notes the seeming complacency of the public, even when they were fully aware of corruption. He concluded \\"Tweed Days in St. Louis\\" by stating, \\"The people may be tired of it [corrupt municipal government], but they cannot give it up‚Äînot yet\\". In \\"The Shame of Minneapolis\\", he reports that many citizens, rather than supporting the grand jury's efforts to clean up the city, tried to discourage them: \\"What startled the jury most, however, was the character of the citizens who were sent to them to dissuade them from their course. No reform I ever studied has failed to bring out this phenomenon of virtuous cowardice, the baseness of the decent citizen\\". As the Folk investigation continued in St. Louis, Steffens notes, the people were so apathetic that they passively allowed three convicted politicians to return to their seats in the city legislature. In Philadelphia, he noted, \\"good people there defend corruption and boast of their machine.\\"Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 3, 41, 61, 72, 136. Steffens is also skeptical of reform efforts. He is concerned that popular reform movements are inadequate to really clean up government: ‚Äú'reforms' are spasmodic efforts to punish bad rulers and get somebody that will give us good government or something that will make it\\".Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 137. As Steffens biographer Patrick F. Palermo writes, Steffens' \\"answer to the problem of corruption was good, strong men. ‚Ä¶Steffens seriously argued that this corrupt system that either co-opted or overwhelmed its opponents could be tamed by individuals\\".Patrick F. Palermo, Lincoln Steffens (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1978), 50. Ultimately, though, Steffens still expresses faith that the public can be made to care about having good government. In the introduction to The Shame of the Cities, Steffens writes: \\"We Americans may have failed. We may be mercenary and selfish. Democracy with us may be impossible and corruption inevitable, but these articles, if they have proved nothing else, have demonstrated beyond doubt that we can stand the truth; that there is pride in the character of American citizenship; and that this pride may be a power in the land\\". He thought that the public could still be shamed into action against corrupt government: the goal of his book, he writes at its outset, is \\"to sound the civic pride of an apparently shameless citizenship\\". The reaction to his articles, he thought, demonstrated that \\"our shamelessness is superficial, that beneath it lies a pride which, being real, may save us yet.\\"Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 18, 1, 16. ==Reception== ===Critical reaction=== The Shame of the Cities received widespread critical acclaim upon its publication. Public figures described Steffens' work as groundbreaking. Newspaper editor William Allen White, for example, declared that the book \\"has done for American cities what De Tocqueville did for the country over a hundred years ago\\". The owner of the Chicago Tribune, Medill McCormick, had equally high praise for the book, saying, \\"Nothing has been printed which so well portrays municipal conditions in America.\\"Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 130. The book received equally positive reviews in major American magazines. Alfred Hodder, in the literary journal The Bookman, declared that the book's \\"facts are of the utmost interest and importance, or should be, to every man in the United States who has at heart any wish to be a decent citizen.\\"Alfred Hodder, \\"NINE BOOKS OF THE DAY.: I. LINCOLN STEFFENS' \\"THE SHAME OF THE CITIES,\\" The Bookman (May 1904), 302. The Independent also considered The Shame of the Cities a book \\"of the utmost importance\\".\\"Review 1 -- No Title\\", The Independent 56, 289 (June 23, 1904), 1449. The Outlook gave the book a slightly cooler reception, claiming that it was worth reading, but likely overstated the prevalence of municipal corruption in the country.\\"The Diagnosis and Cure of Municipal Corruption\\", Outlook 76, no. 16 (April 16, 1904), 916. Each of these reviews draws attention to Steffens' claim that business is to blame for urban corruption, rather than the poor or the nature of government itself; however, they do not directly discuss Steffens' observations about public responsibility for corruption. The book, furthermore, made Steffens a national celebrity. He became such a prominent figure that \\"Even a cigar company joined the rush to praise Steffens by naming a cigar after him and featuring his face on the box\\".Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 114. William Randolph Hearst invited Steffens to his home for dinner.Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 130. Steffens also became highly in demand as a speaker, receiving speaking invitations from across the country, including from his college, the University of California.Justin Kaplan, Lincoln Steffens: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 127. He also gained international fame: The Shame of the Cities became very popular in England, and the editor of a London magazine offered Steffens a comfortable job if he felt like moving there.Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 114. ===Literary significance=== Steffens' work helped usher in the muckraking era. Of his articles, the most significant to the development of muckraking journalism was \\"The Shame of Minneapolis,\\" which was published in the January 1903 issue of McClure‚Äôs alongside a section from Tarbell's The History of the Standard Oil Company and Ray Stannard Baker's \\"The Right to Work: The Story of the Non-Striking Miners\\".Patrick F. Palermo, Lincoln Steffens (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1978), 56. Peter Hartshorn notes the importance of this best-selling issue in muckraking's rise to prominence: \\"Other magazines, notably Collier‚Äôs, Leslie‚Äôs, and Everybody‚Äôs, quickly grasped what the public was demanding: articles that not only entertained and informed but also exposed. Americans were captivated by the muckrakers and their ability to provide names, dollar amounts, and other titillating specifics\\".Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 103. The articles that make up The Shame of the Cities, especially the Minneapolis article, thus played a key role in popularizing muckraking and its spread to other publications. ===Political significance=== Steffens' account of Folk helped him rise to political prominence in Missouri. The two St. Louis articles, along with another follow- up piece Steffens wrote in April 1904, helped rally support for Folk and helped him be elected governor of Missouri later that year.Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2011), 113-115. In the introduction to The Shame of the Cities, Steffens himself draws attention to reform in St. Louis. \\"The Shamelessness of St. Louis\\", he claims, finally drove the city's people to action against the reigning machine, as they worked to prove wrong his claim that the public was apathetic: \\"From that moment the city has been determined and active, and boodle seems to be doomed\\".Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (New York: Sagamore Press, 1957), 14-15. Steffens' and the other muckrakers' work also helped change the national political climate. Palermo credits the muckrakers and their calls for reform for helping progressive reformers rise to political power in the states, and, to a lesser extent, in Congress, by 1906. Newly elected governors and members of Congress, he notes, followed the muckrakers' example, and \\"thundered forth their condemnation of the 'interests,‚Äô 'the system,‚Äô and 'privilege.' Within four years, the progressive movement would be the most potent force in American politics.\\"Patrick F. Palermo, Lincoln Steffens (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1978), 66. ==See also== *Muckraking *Progressivism in the United States ==Notes== ==References== \\"The Diagnosis and Cure of Municipal Corruption\\".

It lies upon the River Dever . The river, and village, formerly part of Stratton Park, lie on a Hampshire grass downland, underlain with chalk and flint. Parts of the river now disappear in summer through lack of replenishment, evaporation and, more specifically, the porous nature of the bedrock. Micheldever was once converted into a secret military base during the Second World War (WW2). This information was declassified by the British government in 2012. Micheldever was a key intelligence and foreign reconnaissance base during the peak of the world war and was used to store and distribute intelligence across the south east. Operational status : The Micheldever intelligence base was decommissioned in 1953 after it was deemed to have fulfilled its purpose during the war. Speculation have started of military activity today, however there has been no evidence and the government deny any military activity. ==Micheldever Parish== Micheldever Parish is the most northerly in the borough of The City of Winchester. The parish incorporates Micheldever, Micheldever Station (a separate village), East Stratton, West Stratton, Weston Colley, and the hamlet of Woodmancott. ==Facilities== The village has a church (St Mary the Virgin; Church of England), a telephone exchange, a shop, a Church of England primary school, and a pub (The Half Moon And Spread Eagle). ==Micheldever Nude== A renowned photograph by Bill Brandt, Micheldever Nude (1948), was taken inside Micheldever House, the home of the photographer's father, L. W. Brandt. L. W. Brandt died in 1965, aged 89, and is believed to be buried in Micheldever churchyard. ==Buildings== The oldest property in Micheldever village itself lies on The Crease, Duke Street. Shillingbury (88) and Corner Cottage (89) make up the old Hall House built 1453. Made from traditional materials and methods The Crease lies to the south east of St. Mary The Virgin church. Local folklore has for a long time believed it to be a Pilgrims' Hospice. However, although the land was owned by the Abbot and Monks of Newminster, it is more likely to have been a wealthy yeoman. Shillingbury forms the main hall, cross passage and first bedchamber. Corner Cottage forms the parlour and second bedchamber together with an extension to join it to the old Forge. The building is the only house to have been built using a jetty without a cantilever. The hall contains a rare jointed cruck, an arched beam from one side of the house to the other. In the 16th century the hall was floored. The large carved beam that supports the floor is thought to have come from Hyde Abbey. ==Transport== The village is served by Micheldever railway station ‚Äì located to the north ‚Äì on the main railway line between London and Southampton, in the village of Micheldever Station. It is the only station between Basingstoke and Winchester; its remote existence explained by its original name of Andover Road; the town of Andover not receiving its own station until much later. Micheldever Station was the starting point for the first automobile journey in Britain, in 1895. CrossCountry train travelling northbound through Micheldever Station August 2014 Micheldever is located from the A303 to the West Country, and from Junction 8 of the M3 motorway. The village lies approximately off the A33 road, originally a Roman road which, until the opening of the M3 extension in 1985, was the main route for traffic between Southampton and London. ==First automobile journey== Micheldever Station was the starting point for the first automobile journey in Britain, in 1895. The vehicle, a Daimler-engined Panhard-Levassor, had been ordered from France by the Hon Evelyn Ellis (1843‚Äì1913). It was transported across the channel by ferry and then to Micheldever Station by train. Ellis received delivery on the platform and drove the vehicle to Datchet, deliberately testing an Act of Parliament that required all self-propelled vehicles on public roads to travel at no more than 4 mph and to be preceded by a man waving a red flag. Ellis was not arrested and the Act was repealed in 1896. ==Waste conversion plant== Clean Power Properties had plans to build a waste conversion plant at Micheldever Station. This had been referred to in the press as a waste incinerator. The plans were withdrawn in 2015. ==References== == External links == *The Half Moon and Spread Eagle *Comprehensive details *Illustrated details of the church *Micheldever Church of England Primary School *Micheldever Parish Council (new website in 2018) * Category:Villages in Hampshire ","title":"Micheldever"},{"id":"3258587","text":"Yulia Vladimirovna Drunina (, May 10, 1924 ‚Äì November 21, 1991) was a Soviet poet who wrote in the Russian language. She was a nurse and a combat medic during World War II and known for writing lyrics and poetry about women at war. Her works are characterized by moral clarity, sincere intonation and based on her real life experience, including participation in the war as a source of inspiration for her writings. ==Biography== Yulia grew up in Moscow. Her father was a history teacher and her mother worked in a library and gave music lessons. Julia started writing poetry when she was 11 and in the late 1930s one of her poems won a contest and was published in a newspaper. After the USSR was attacked by Germany in June 1941, 17-year-old Julia joined the Red Cross, trained as a nurse and began volunteering at a local hospital. Later that summer, as the German army approached Moscow, she was dispatched to help build fortifications near Mozhaisk, about 100 km to the West of the capital. There, during an air strike, she got separated from her party and was picked up by a group infantrymen, who needed a combat medic. The group later found itself encircled by the enemy and spent 13 days breaking out through occupied territory. During those 13 days, Yulia fell in love with the battalion commander and described him in several poems written throughout her life, by referring to him simply as \\"Commander\\". The commander, along with several other infantrymen from the group, did not make it out of the encirclement, having been killed by a landmine explosion. Yulia returned to Moscow in the fall of 1941 but soon left for Siberia, together with her father, as part of the civilian evacuation. She did not want to leave Moscow and agreed to evacuate only because of her ailing father, who had suffered a stroke at the beginning of the War. After her father died in early 1942, Yulia went to Khabarovsk, in the Russian Far East, where she enrolled in a school for aviation technicians but, wanting to fight on the frontlines, she soon joined a rifle unit as a combat medic and was sent to the Belorussian Front, where she served alongside Zinaida Samsonova (also a combat medic), who in 1944 died in combat and was posthumously awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union. Drunina later wrote one of her most heartfelt poems, \\"Zinka\\", about Samsonova. In 1943 Drunina was seriously injured when a shell fragment struck her in the neck several millimeters from her carotid artery. Unaware of the severity of her injury, she simply wrapped her neck in bandages and continued to work. Eventually, she was hospitalized in critical condition and was said to have barely survived. She wrote her first poems about the War while in the hospital. After recovering, she returned to Moscow where she applied to the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute but was denied admission, her writing having been deemed not mature enough. She then returned to the front and fought near Pskov and in the Baltic region. She was wounded again in November 1944 and spent the rest of the War in Moscow where she again tried her luck at the Literature Institute and this time was allowed to enroll as a war veteran. She married her classmate and fellow war veteran Nikolai Starshinov in 1944 and gave birth to her only daughter, Elena, in 1946. The family lived in a communal apartment in extreme poverty in post-war Moscow, while Julia continued to write. Several of her poems were published in the 1940s, including her first book in 1948, followed by several more in the subsequent decades. She also wrote a short story, \\"Aliska\\" and an autobiographical novel, \\"From Three Peaks\\". In 1960, she divorced her first husband and married screenwriter Alexei Kapler, whom she had met in 1954. Drunina and Kapler remained happily married until Kapler's death in 1979. Drunina devoted many poems to her husband. During the perestroika era, she was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. During the August Coup, 1991, she was one of the many intellectuals to take part in defending the \\"White House\\". However, she was terribly depressed later by dissolution of the Soviet Union and publications critical of the Soviet system. She committed suicide on November 21, 1991. She was buried next to her husband, Alexei Kapler at the Starokrymskoe cemetery in Stary Krym. A minor planet 3804 Drunina, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh in 1969 is named after her. == References == == External links == * Yulia Drunina.

In addition he also co-stars in the movie with Michael Chow and Colman Domingo. The movie is about a monk who tries to find a mysterious lost \\"Fountain of Youth\\" (a magic peach). He travels to British Columbia (actually filmed in San Francisco, poking fun at movies like Rumble in the Bronx that disguise BC locations to look like US cities), and, with a new band of friends, tries to retrieve the stolen artifact. The parody comes into play here with many jokes making fun of old Kung fu movies, for instance joking about how all the bad guys make \\"Hi-yah!\\" sounds. ==Plot== The plot follows Art Chew's (a pun of the sound one makes when sneezing) quest to retrieve the ancient peach. The movie starts with Art Chew traveling to America, as well as showing Art's training at the Shur-li temple (a play on words with the child actor Shirley Temple), showing many kung-fu clich√©s such as grabbing the pebble from the masters hand (which Art succeeds without effort), fighting on trees (in this case small potted palms) and \\"listing\\" for elements (Earth, Wind & Fire play a funky tune). After the montage is shown, Art meets up with his cousin Wayman (a parody on the way Chinese pronounce r as w), a Chinese adult who tries to act American so he isn't embarrassed by stereotypes, and foster cousin Roy Lee, an African American who sincerely believes he is a reincarnation of Bruce Lee. Not long after Art arrives, Helen Hu, an MSG (Monosodium glutamate) dealing (portrayed like a cocaine dealer) restaurant owner, forces Art's stereotypical uncle into buying more MSG. Art intervenes and tries to fight Helen's muscle, the overweight and strong One Ton (perhaps a play on the Chinese dish wonton soup), the wise cracking \\"brains\\" of the outfit Lo Fat and the Kung-Fu fighter Non Fat. After blocking One Ton's attack, Art reels to attack showing a smiley face on his arm which Lo Fat points out as a symbol of a Shur-li monk and they run away. Art talks to his uncle and asks where the Ancient peach is and is told that it is in Helen Hu's restaurant (a brief humorous spectacle emerges in the conversation as Art and the others mix the name Hu with the article \\"who\\") that Art's uncle sold to her a few years ago. Art, Wayman and Roy Lee go to Helen's restaurant and are taken to her by a waiter that is badly dubbed because \\"This is how all Hong Kong actors talk\\". Helen claims to know nothing about the peach and gets One Ton to escort Art and his friends to leave. On the way out, Roy Lee tries to kick Non Fat but misses and breaks a hole in the wall. After Art and crew are thrown out Lo Fat notices a glowing coming out of the hole in the wall and looks in and finds the ancient peach. Events lead to the peach being swapped around a couple of times and the appearance of a romantic interest, Sue Shi (sushi), who is later revealed to be an agent of the Shur-li temple. ==External links== *Official Website * Category:2003 films Category:2000s parody films Category:Chinatown, San Francisco Category:2003 comedy films ","title":"Kung Phooey"},{"id":"3258605","text":"A transnational feminist network (TFN) is a network of women‚Äôs groups who work together for women‚Äôs rights at both a national and transnational level. They emerged in the mid 1980s as a response to structural adjustment and neoliberal policies, guided by ideas categorized as global feminism. TNF's are composed of representatives from a variety of NGO's from around the globe. These representatives then come together at conferences, such as the United Nations World Conference on Women and The NGO Forum in China. ==Globalization== TFNs are similar to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) but while NGOs work at a local and national level, TFNs create coalitions across borders. Globalization affects women worldwide in adverse ways and TFNs emerged in response to these effects. Feminism is best understand as a global phenomenon as it is a product of transnational dialogues and disagreements. As mentioned by Myra Ferree and Aili Tripp \\"Globalization has facilitated the emergence of feminism as a goal in a wide variety of issue advocacy at the transnational level\\" (Ferree & Tripp 12). According to Johanna Brenner in her article Transnational Feminism and the Struggle for Global Justice: :‚ÄúEconomic insecurity and impoverishment, exposure to toxics, degradation of water, high infant and maternal mortality rates, forced migration, increased hours spent in paid and unpaid work are only some of the indicates (sic) of women‚Äôs burdens worldwide‚Äù Brenner also states that :‚Äú[t]hird world governments are male-dominated, often inefficient, plagued by cronyism, and sometimes corrupt; and the pressures of structural adjustment programs imposed on them by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have certainly aggravated these tendencies‚Äù (Brenner 78). Programs like Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) are part of the package of globalization that is presented to other countries; and while such programs are portrayed as being valuable to improve the status of a country, they result in creating worse situations for the peoples of a country. ==Aims of TFNs== Transnational Feminist Networks can be divided into different categories based on their goals. Some of these include Advocacy for Women's Human Rights, Peace, Anti-militarism, Conflict Resolution, Ending Violence Against Women and Reproductive and Health Rights. ===Response to Globalization=== Women‚Äôs groups form in response to the negative effects of globalization and TFNs emerge when these women‚Äôs groups come together to resolve shared issues. These groups work with one another across borders and they recognize their differences but also discover their similarities and form strong coalition‚Äôs bases on these similarities. In describing a conference held by the International Network of Women‚Äôs Studies Journals, Tahera Aftab relayed that :‚Äúthe objective of the INWSJ conference was to set up a network for interdisciplinary feminist and women‚Äôs studies journals with a focus on the development and inclusion of a transnational feminist understanding of women‚Äôs development issues‚Ä¶‚Äù Just as these academics worked to reach consensus on issues, so do women‚Äôs groups who form TFNs. Valentine Mogadam best describes TFNs in her book Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminist Networks. She states in her text: :‚ÄúTFN‚Äôs have arisen in the context of economic, political, and cultural globalization‚Äîand they are tackling both the particularistic and the hegemonic trends of globalization. They are advancing criticisms of inequalities and forms of oppression, neoliberal economic policies, unsustainable economic growth and consumption, and patriarchal controls over women. In a word, transnational feminist networks are the organizational expression of the transnational women‚Äôs movement, or global feminism‚Äù (Moghadam 104). ===Women's Human Rights and Security=== Another widespread aim of transnational feminist networks is to create a stronger sense of global human security while building peace. McKay argues that women and girls perspectives are a necessary component in developing programs and policies. There is a difference in the way men and women experience security and TNF‚Äôs have a role in amplifying the women‚Äôs perspectives to be acted upon. In specific, Woroniuk states that dimensions of women‚Äôs security include ‚Äú(1) violence against women, (2) gender inequality in control over resources, (3) gender inequality in power and decision making, (4) women‚Äôs human rights, and (5) women (and men) as actors, not victims.‚Äù These areas are taken into account in TFN‚Äôs approach to policy changes and public awareness. ==Outcomes== In 1995 the United Nations held the Fourth World Conference on women that was dedicated towards creating an approach to the marginalization of women. The outcome was a ‚Äúgendering of the agenda‚Äù for other conferences worldwide, which included a focus on gender neutral approaches and prioritizing women‚Äôs rights in policy making. TNF‚Äôs response to world events can have a strong impact on the actions of governments and societies. An example of such was when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 1996 and a harsher regime threatened women‚Äôs security and rights. Pressure put on governments from feminists around the world resulted in an isolation of the Taliban and an importance placed on Afghan women‚Äôs rights. ==Examples== A few TFN‚Äôs: *Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), *Women Learning Partnership for Rights, Development, and Peace (WLP), *Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) (https://web.archive.org/web/20091029172850/http://www.wluml.org/), and *Association for Women‚Äôs Rights in Development (AWID) (http://www.awid.org). *Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL) *Women's Alliance for Development (WAD) ==References== * Aftab, Tahera; \\"Lobbying for Transnational Feminism: Feminist Conversations Make Connections.\\" NWSA Journal Summer 2002.

A polyphyodont is any animal whose teeth are continually replaced. In contrast, diphyodonts are characterized by having only two successive sets of teeth. Polyphyodonts include most toothed fishes, many reptiles such as crocodiles and geckos,Mechanism of tooth replacement in Leopard geckos and most other vertebrates, mammals being the main exception. ==Growth== New, permanent teeth grow in the jaws, usually under or just behind the old tooth, from stem cells in the dental lamina. Young animals typically have a full set of teeth when they hatch; there is no tooth change in the egg. Within days, tooth replacement begins, usually in the back of the jaw continuing forward like a wave. On average a tooth is replaced every few months. ==Crocodilia== Crocodilia are the only non-mammalian vertebrates with tooth sockets. Alligators grow a successional tooth (a small replacement tooth) under each mature functional tooth for replacement once a year, each tooth being replaced up to 50 times in the alligator's life. Crocodilia are researched for tooth regeneration in humans. ==Evolution in mammals== Manatees, elephants and kangaroos are unusual among mammals because they are polyphyodonts, in contrast to most other mammals which replace their teeth only once in their lives (diphyodont). Although most other extant mammals are not polyphyodont, mammalian ancestors were. During the evolution of Therapsida, there was a period during which mammals were so small and short-lived that wear on the teeth yielded no significant selection pressure to constantly replace them. Instead, mammals evolved different types of teeth which formed a unit able to crack the exoskeleton of arthropods. Molars came later in their evolution (as earlier in cerapods and Diplodocus). Mammals chew (masticate) their food which requires a set of firmly attached, strong teeth and a \\"full\\" tooth row without gaps. The manatees have no incisor or canine teeth, just a set of cheek teeth, which are not clearly differentiated into molars and premolars. These teeth are continuously replaced throughout their life with new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther forward in the mouth, a process known as \\"hind molar progression\\" or ‚Äúmarching molars‚Äù. ==See also== *Regeneration (biology) *Regenerative medicine *Regenerative endodontics *Schultz's rule *Sinoconodon *Squamata *Tooth development ==References== Category:Fish anatomy Category:Dentition types Category:Animal anatomy ","title":"Polyphyodont"},{"id":"3258646","text":"Igboland (Standard https://businessday.ng/columnist/article/planting-and- watering-the-grass-of-ala-igbo-for-a-new- era/https://www.legit.ng/1151109-origin-igbo-tribe-nigeria.html, also known as Southeastern Nigeria, is the homeland of the Igbo people.Baikie (1854) uses I¬¥gbo as the term for Igboland: \\"I¬¥gbo, as I have formerly mentioned, extends east and west, from the Old Kalab√°r river to the banks of the Kw√≥ra, and possesses also some territory at Ab√≥ to the westward of the latter stream.\\" (p. 307). It is a cultural and common linguistic region in southern Nigeria. Geographically, it is divided by the lower Niger River into two sections: an eastern (the larger of the two) and a western one. Its population is characterised by the diverse Igbo culture and the speakers of equally diverse Igbo languages. Politically, Igboland is divided into several southern Nigerian states; culturally, it has included several subgroupings, including the following ethnicities: :Anioma : Ngwa :Abiriba : Edda Egbebu : Ezaa : Ibeku : Ohuhu : Ikwerre : Ika : Ogba : Omuma : Ekpeye In the mid-nineteenth century, William Balfour Baikie remarked that > \\"in Igbo[land] each person hails, as a sailor would say, from the particular > district where he was born, but when away from home all are Igbos. And yet > considerable differences exist between different parts of this extensive > country, and the dialects spoken also vary greatly.\\" ==Territorial boundaries== Igboland is surrounded on all sides by large rivers, and other southern and central Nigeria indigenous tribes, namely Bini, Urhobo-Isoko, Ijaw, Ogoni, Igala, Tiv, Yako, Idoma and Ibibio. In the words of William B. Baikie again, > \\"Igbo homeland, extends east and west, from the Old Kalabar river to the > banks of the Kwora, Niger River, and possesses also some territory at Aboh, > an Igbo clan, to the west-ward of the latter stream. On the north it borders > on Igara, Igala and A'kpoto, and it is separated from the sea only by petty > tribes, all of which trace their origin to this great race\\". It is primarily situated in the Lowland forest region of Nigeria, with parts in the Niger-Delta. Here the Niger river fans out into the Atlantic Ocean in a vast network of creeks and mangrove swamps on the Bight of Bonny. The earliest found settlements in Igboland date to 4500 BC in the central area, from where the majority of the Igbo-speaking population is believed to have migrated. The northern Igbo Kingdom of Nri, which rose around the 10th century AD, is credited with the foundation of much of Igboland's culture, customs, and religious practices. It is the oldest existing monarchy in present-day Nigeria. In southern Igboland several groups developed, of which the most notable was the Aro Confederacy. During the late 19th century, Igboland was made part of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate of the British Empire and was amalgamated into modern-day Nigeria in 1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Shortly afterward, Igboland was involved in its biggest war during Biafra's movement for secession. It ended in 1970, when Nigerian government forces prevailed in the conflict. ==Geography and biodiversity== Historically, Igboland has taken up a large part of southeastern Nigeria, mostly on the eastern side of the Niger River. The Igbos claim their territory extends westward across the Niger to the regions of Aniocha, Ndokwa, Ukwuani, and Ika in present-day Delta State. Its eastern side is terminated by the Cross River, although micro-communities exist over on the other side of the river; its northernmost point enters the Savannah climate around Nsukka. Nkanu West, Enugu In Nigeria today, Igboland is roughly made up of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo, Northern Delta and Rivers states, and small parts of Akwa Ibom. More than 30 million people inhabit Igboland and with a population density ranging from it could be the most densely populated area in Africa after the Nile Valley.Chigere, p. 22. Altogether Igboland has an area of some . ==Ancient trade routes== Igboland's culture has been shaped by its rainforest climate, its ancient trade along the rivers, migration, and social history within its various clans and peoples. It has been influenced by its ancient trading neighbours, allies, and more recently by relations with Europeans. Mid-nineteenth century trader W. B. Baikie said, \\"I seized the moment, and, by our interpreter, told Tshukuma, that we had come to make his acquaintance and his friendship, and to ascertain if the people were willing to trade with us.\\" He signed a trade agreement with Igbo chief, Tshukuma (Chukwuma) Obi from Aboh clan, one of the leading Igbo clans, which engaged in early active trading with Europe. Similarly, Baikie recounted that \\"after our salutations, I spoke of friendship, of trade, and of education, and particularly enlarged upon the evils of war, and the benefits of peace, all of which was well received\\", when signing a trade agreement on August 30, 1885 with Ezebogo, an Igbo chief in Asaba. Due to the native common linguistic standard and interrelated cultures in Igboland, the lower Niger River, which divides Igboland into unequal eastern and western parts, has from ancient times provided easy means of communication, trading and unity amongst the Igbo on both sides of the river. It also enabled ancient trade and migration of people into Igboland, and between Igboland and rest of the world. Some of the notable ancient trade and export routes in Igboland included the famous lower Niger and Njaba-Oguta lake-Orashi navigational routes via Asaba-Onitsha-Aboh, and Awo-omamma-Oguta-Ogba‚ÄìEgbema‚ÄìNdoni-Aboh ferry services, respectively. ==History== ===Stone Age=== There is evidence of Late Stone Age (late Paleolithic) human presence from at least 10,000 years ago. Early settlement of Igboland is dated to 6000 BC based on pottery found in the Okigwe, Oka Igwe, and known today as Awka. In 1978 a team led by Thurstan Shaw, with the University of Nigeria at Nsukka, excavated a rock quarry. They found that it was a mine for tool and pottery making for a 'stone civilisation' nearby at Ibagwa. Anthropologists at the University of Benin have discovered fossils and use of monoliths dating to 4500 BC at Ngodo in the Uturu town.Oliver Ifeanyi Anyabolu, Nigeria, past to the present: from 500 B.C. to the present (2000), p. 12. Further evidence of ancient settlements were uncovered at what researchers believe may be an Nsukka metal cultural area from 3000 BC, and later settlements attributed to Ngwa culture at AD 8-18. It is unclear what cultural links there are between these pre-historic artefacts and the people of the region today. Later human settlement in the region may have links with other discoveries made in the wider area, particularly with the culture associated with the terracotta discoveries at Nok, which spanned a wide area of present-day north-central Nigeria. Some local villagers retain what they believe are original names of settlements, such as Umuzuoka, The Blacksmiths Ezioka, Okigwe, Imoka, etc.; excerpted in \\"Cultural Harmony I: Igboland ‚Äî the World of Man and the World of Spirits\\", section 4 of Kalu Ogbaa, ed., Understanding Things Fall Apart (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1999; ), pp. 83‚Äì85. The Nsukka-Okigwe axis forms a basis for a proposed Proto-Igbo cultural heartland antecedent to contemporary Igbo culture. Much of the Igbo population is believed to have expanded from a smaller area within in this region, diverging into several independent Igbo-speaking tribes, village- groups, kingdoms and states. The movements were generally broken into two trends in migration: a more northerly group that expanded towards the banks of the Niger and the upper quadrant of the Cross River; the other, following a southerly trail, had risen from the Isu populations based closer to the axis from which the majority of southern Igbo communities emerged. Mbaise are notably the best examples of an Igbo group claiming autochthony; they reject theories of many migratory histories about their origins. Based on the proximity of traditions to those of their neighbours, and familial and political ties, many of these groups are apparently culturally northern or southern Igbo. ===Igbo-Ukwu finds (AD 300‚Äì900)=== Igbo-Ukwu was the site of an early indigenous bronze industry that was rediscovered in the 20th century. Many of the items recovered were ritual objects such as this 9th century bronze vessel. The first Igbo Ukwu metal and precious artefacts finds were made accidentally in 1939, when a resident named Isiah Anozie found them in the process of digging a cistern. This led to the discovery of a larger network of linked metal works from the 9th century. The works were based in Igbo Ukwu. Further finds were made found by archaeology teams led by Thurstan Shaw in 1959‚Äì60, and in 1964 in the compound of Jonah Anozie. Initially, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, scholars believed that the Igbo Ukwu bronze and copper items found here had been made elsewhere and were trade goods, or were influenced by outside technology due to their technical sophistication. The opposite was revealed to be true: local copper deposits had been exploited by the 9th century and anthropological evidence, such as the Ichi-like scarifications on the human figures, show the items were of local Igbo cultural origin. The works have since been attributed to an isolated bronze industry, which had developed without outside influence over time and reached great sophistication. Igbo trade routes of the early second millennium reached the cities of Mecca, Medina and Jeddah through a network of trade routes journeyed by middlemen. Beads that originated in India in the 9th century have been found in Igbo Ukwu burial sites: Thousands of glass beads were uncovered from the ruined remains of a nobleman's garments. The burial site was associated with the Nri Kingdom, which began around the same century, according to indigenous history. ===Kingdom of Nri (900‚Äìc. 1560)=== The northern Igbo Kingdom of Nri, rising around the 10th century based on Umunri traditions, is credited with the foundation of much of Igboland's culture, customs, and religious practices. It is the oldest existing monarchy in present-day Nigeria. It was around the mid-10th century that the divine figure Eri is said to have migrated, according to Umunri lore, to the Anambra () river basin -- specifically at its meeting with Ezu river known as Ezu na Omambara in present-day Aguleri. The exact origins of Eri are unknown and much of Nri traditions present him as a divine leader and civiliser sent from heaven to begin civilisation. In contrast, Eri's origins generally suggest a north easterly origin which has sparked up debate pertaining to a possible Igala origin for Eri. Due to historic trade and migration of old, other people also entered the Igboland in about the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries and mixed with the natives. Towards the western end of Igboland, across the Niger River, rose a man known as Eze Chima who fled Benin with his accomplices after a dispute with the Oba of Benin who consequently exiled him in the 1560s. As they left Benin City heading eastwards, Eze Chima and his followers settled in a number of lands and established monarchies with the natives in those areas. Other accounts point to Eze Chima coming from Ife as a result of Ekaladeran, an Bini prince who migrated to Ife from Bini and usurped the original Igbo rulers. . Ife was originally inhabited by Igbos prior to 1300. Those grew into major village groups and towns after the 16th century. Collectively, these places are known as Umuezechima which translates as 'the children or descendants of king Chima'. ===Igala wars and European contact (1450‚Äì1750)=== Igboland was historically known as the Ibo(e), Ebo(e), and Heebo Country by early European explorers. Igboland was conquered by the British Empire after several decades of resistance on all fronts; some of the most famous of the resistance include the Ekumeku Movement, the Anglo-Aro War, and the Aba Women's Riots which was contributed to by women of different ethnic backgrounds in eastern Nigeria. The extreme northern parts of Igboland in the eighteenth were subject to much raiding by elements of the Igala people of Idah under Onoja Oboni, a descendant of one of the Idah royal families. The conflicts drew down further into areas in central northern Igboland, particularly Nsugbe near where early European settlers with Joseph Hawkins noted events from parts of the conflicts between the 'Ebo Country' and 'Galla' in A History of a Voyage to the Coast of Africa published in 1797. Umueri traditions state that Onoja Oboni, however, is of royal Eri stock and founded Idah as he trailed northwards. The Igala do not claim origins from Onoja Oboni or the Igbo. ===Arochukwu and the slave trade (1750‚Äì1850)=== A number of polities rose either directly or indirectly as a result of Nri; the most powerful kingdom of these was the Aro Confederacy which rose in the Cross River region in the 17th century and declined after British colonisation in the early 20th century. The Aro state centred on Arochukwu followed Nri's steady decline, basing much of its economic activities on the rising trade in slaves to Europeans by coastal African middlemen. The present site of Arochukwu was originally settled by the Ibibio people under the Obong Okon Ita kingdom before the conquest of what became Obinkita in the 17th century by two main Igbo groups: the Eze Agwu clan and the Oke Nnachi assisted by the Ibom Isi (or Akpa) mercenaries under the leadership of the Nnubi dynasty. Led by Agwu Inobia, a descendant of Nna Uru from Abiriba, the Eze Agwu clan was centered at their capital Amanagwu and were resisted by Obong Okon Ita which led to the start of the Aro-Ibibio Wars. The war initially became a stalemate. Both sides arranged a marriage between the king of Obong Okon Ita and a woman from Amanagwu. The marriage eventually failed to bring peace but played a decisive role in the war. Oke Nnachi was led by Nnachi Ipia who was a dibia or priest among the Edda people and was called by Agwu Inobia to help in the war against the Ibibio. These groups were followed by a third non-Igbo Ekoi- cultured group, Akpa or Ibom Oburutu who were led by Akuma Nnaubi, the first Eze Aro, the title of the king of the Aro. In southern Igboland several groups developed mostly independent of Nri influence. Most of these groups followed a migration out of Isu communities in present-day Imo State, although some communities, such as the Mbaise cluster of village groups, claim to be autochthonous. ===Colonial era (1850‚Äì1960)=== Enugu, the capital city of the old Eastern Region of Nigeria. Following the British parliament's abolition of the slave trade in 1807, the British Royal Navy had opened up trade with coastal towns Bonny and Opobo and further inland on the Niger with Asaba in the 1870s. The palm oil industry, the biggest export, grew large and important to the British who traded here. British arrival and trade led to increased encounters between the Igbo and other polities and ethnic groups around the Niger River and led to a deepening sense of a distinct Igbo ethnic identity. Missionaries had started arriving in the 1850s. The Igbo, at first wary of the religion, started to embrace Christianity and Western education as traditional society broke down. Christianity had played a great part in the introduction of European ideology into Igbo society and culture often time through erasure of cultural practice; adherents to the denominations were often barred in partaking in ancient rites and traditions, and joining fraternities and secret societies were forbidden as the church grew stronger. Due to the incompatibility of the Igbo decentralized style of government and the centralized system required for British indirect rule, British colonial rule was marked with open conflicts and much tension. Under British colonial rule, the diversity within each of Nigeria's major ethnic groups slowly decreased and distinctions between the Igbo and other large ethnic groups, such as the Hausa and the Yoruba, became sharper. British rule brought about changes in culture such as the introduction of warrant chiefs as Eze (traditional rulers) where there were no such monarchies. ===Nigerian independence and Civil War (1960s)=== Following the independence of Nigeria from the United Kingdom in 1960, most of Igboland was included in its Eastern Region. Flag of the Republic of Biafra (1967‚Äì1970), sometimes regarded as the ethnic flag of the Igbo. Following a coup in 1966 which saw mostly Igbo soldiers assassinating politicians from the western and northern regions of Nigeria, Johnson Aguiyi- Ironsi seized control of Lagos, the capital, and came into power as military head of state of Nigeria. In revolt and retaliation against the government General Aguiyi-Ironsi was ambushed and assassinated by Northern members of the military on 29 July 1966 in a revolt against that had strong ethnic overtones. Ironsi's assassination stood out more because of the method of his killers; Ironsi had his legs tied to the back of a Land Rover and was driven around town while still attached. The Eastern Region formed the core of the secessionist Republic of Biafra. A regional council of the peoples of Eastern Nigeria decided the region should secede as the Republic of Biafra on May 30, 1967. Nigerian General Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu on this day made a declaration of independence of Biafra from Nigeria and became the head of state of the new republic. The Nigerian Civil War (or the \\"Nigerian-Biafran War\\") lasted from 6 July 1967 until 15 January 1970, after which Biafra once again became part of Nigeria. The Republic of Biafra was defeated after three years of war by the federal government of Nigeria from 1967 to 1970 with military support from the United Kingdom (strategy and ammunition), Soviet Union (ammunition), the United Arab Republic (air force), as well as with support from other states around the world. The effects of Nigerian war strategies such as starvation on Biafran civilians (most of whom were ethnic Igbo) remains a controversial topic. The movement for the sovereignty of Biafra has continued with a minority, most making up the MASSOB organisation. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== *Igboland's Culture and Language, Igboguide.org *Pictorial tour of Igboland Category:History of Igboland Category:Cultural regions Category:Separatism in Nigeria Category:Regions of West Africa ","title":"Igboland"},{"id":"3258651","text":"A diphyodont is any animal with two successive sets of teeth, initially the \\"deciduous\\" set and consecutively the \\"permanent\\" set.Myers, P., R.

Diphyodonts contrast with polyphyodonts, whose teeth are constantly replaced. Diphyodonts also differ from monophyodonts which are animals who have only one set of teeth that do not change over a long period of growth. In diphyodonts, the number of teeth that are replaced varies from species to species. In humans, a set of twenty deciduous teeth, or \\"milk teeth\\", are replaced by a completely new set of thirty-two adult teeth. In some cases hypodontia or hyperdontia occurs, the latter in cleidocranial dysostosis and Gardner's syndrome.

He played the majority of his fifteen-year professional career for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Chicago Blackhawks during his final season before signing a one-day contract to officially retire as a Hurricane in 2019. Ward was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, growing up there and in the Edmonton suburb of Sherwood Park, Alberta. During his three-year junior career in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Red Deer Rebels, he was selected 25th overall by the Hurricanes in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. After a season with the Hurricanes' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters, he won the Stanley Cup with the Hurricanes in 2006, winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. He became the first starting goaltender to win the Stanley Cup as a rookie since Patrick Roy in 1986. ==Playing career== ===Early career=== Ward spent his junior career with the Red Deer Rebels of the Western Hockey League (WHL). After appearing in one game for the Rebels in 2000‚Äì01, Ward played three full seasons with the team from 2001‚Äì2004, leading them to the WHL finals twice. Ward was drafted 25th overall by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. Upon graduating from the WHL, Ward signed a multi-year, entry-level contract with the Hurricanes on May 13, 2004. Due to the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, he was assigned to Carolina's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters, for the season. ===Carolina Hurricanes=== Joining the Hurricanes for the 2005‚Äì06 NHL season, Ward largely served in a backup role to Swiss goalie Martin Gerber during the regular season. He made his NHL debut on October 5, 2005, replacing Gerber after the starter injured his hamstring. He saved 10 of 11 shots in the third period, as the Hurricanes lost 5‚Äì2 to the Tampa Bay Lightning.Carolina Hurricanes at Tampa Bay Lightning scoresheet, accessed 2006-08-23 He made his first NHL start the following game two days later in the club's home opener against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Ward turned aside Mario Lemieux, ≈Ωigmund P√°lffy and Sidney Crosby in a shootout, as the Hurricanes won 3‚Äì2. Ward completed his NHL rookie season with 14 wins and 8 losses, along with a 3.68 goals against average. Ward with the Hurricanes during the 2013‚Äì14 NHL season In the opening round of the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Hurricanes faced a two-win deficit against the Montreal Canadiens. With Gerber struggling in the series, Hurricanes coach Peter Laviolette turned to Ward. The goaltending switch prompted Carolina to a series comeback, advancing to the second round against the New Jersey Devils, where he played opposite his personal hero, Martin Brodeur. After eliminating the Devils, the Hurricanes defeated the Buffalo Sabres in seven games. Facing the Edmonton Oilers in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, he helped the Hurricanes to the franchise's first Stanley Cup. In doing so, he became the first rookie goaltender to lead his team to the Stanley Cup as a starter since Patrick Roy in 1986. Against Edmonton, he also became the first rookie goaltender to both play and record a shutout in the Finals since Roy. He tied the rookie record for wins in the playoffs (15), previously held by Roy and Ron Hextall, and became the first rookie goalie to win the Conn Smythe Trophy since Hextall in 1987. After his heroics in the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Ward became the Hurricanes starting goaltender for the 2006‚Äì07 season. He recorded season stats of 30‚Äì21‚Äì6 and 37‚Äì25‚Äì5 in the 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08 campaigns, respectively. The Hurricanes would miss the playoffs both years. The Hurricanes, however, would reach the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2008‚Äì09 season before bowing out to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins. Ward went 8‚Äì10 with a 2.67 GAA during the playoffs. Ward and the Hurricanes struggled to begin the 2009‚Äì10 season, as Ward went 2‚Äì9‚Äì3 to start the campaign. On November 8, 2009, in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, Ward was injured when he was cut on the leg by the skate of opposing forward Rick Nash. As Ward was helped into the dressing room, he left a trail of blood on the ice. After returning from his injury, Ward finished the season with an 18‚Äì23‚Äì5 record, a 2.69 GAA and .916 save percentage as the Hurricanes failed to qualify for the post-season. Ward was selected to participate in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game, along with teammates Eric Staal, Jamie McBain, and Jeff Skinner. Ward was the first overall pick in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game Fantasy Draft, selected by All-Star Game captain, Eric Staal. Ward was credited with an empty-net goal against the New Jersey Devils on December 26, 2011, when a misplaced pass from Ilya Kovalchuk found its way into the empty goal after a rebound from Ward. He is the tenth goalie in NHL history to do this. Ward recorded his 500th game with the Carolina Hurricanes on February 27, 2015. During the offseason, Ward re-signed with the Hurricanes to a two- year, $6.6 million contract on June 16, 2016. On March 22, 2018, during a game against the Arizona Coyotes, the puck got stuck in his skate without his knowledge. His skates crossed the goal line when he went back into the net, ultimately resulting in an own goal. Despite this, the Hurricanes ended up winning that game 6‚Äì5. ===Chicago Blackhawks=== On July 1, 2018, Ward signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. He went 16‚Äì12‚Äì4 in 33 appearances for the team during the 2018‚Äì19 season. ===Retirement=== On August 28, 2019, Ward signed a one-day contract with the Hurricanes and subsequently retired from professional hockey. He retired as the Hurricanes' franchise leaders in wins (318) and shutouts (27). ==International play== Ward's performance in his NHL rookie season earned him consideration on a list of 81 candidates to play for Team Canada in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He was one of nine goalies selected; he was not, however, named to the Canadian squad. Additionally, Ward was named a part of the summer camp roster for Team Canada in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics, but did not make the final roster cut. Ward was a member of the Canadian team that won gold at the 2007 IIHF World Championship in a 4‚Äì2 win against Finland in Moscow, as well as a member of the team that won silver at the 2008 IIHF World Championship in a 5‚Äì4 loss to Russia. == Personal life == Born in St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Ward is the second child of Ken and Laurel Ward. He grew up in the Lakeridge neighbourhood of Saskatoon and the Edmonton suburb of Sherwood Park, Alberta, spending his adolescent years in the latter. He attended junior high at F.R. Haythorne Jr. High School and high school at Salisbury Composite High School in Sherwood Park, until he graduated. Ward is a fan of his native province's team the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). On March 25, 2007, Ward shaved his head for the St. Baldrick's Foundation. Ward and his wife Cody have a son and a daughter. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:75%\\" - ALIGN=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\"  Regular season ! align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"8\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\"  Playoffs - ALIGN=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Located around north of Hadleigh, in 2005 it had a population of 960, increasing to 1,054 at the 2011 Census. ==History== According to Eilert Ekwall the meaning of the village name is Bild's homestead. According to 'Bildeston Church and Village' by Sue Andrews, the village came into existence around 1,100 years ago. Although two Roman roads crossed here, little evidence has been found of any Roman settlement, only of Bildr, supposedly, seven centuries later, as an invading Danish leader, whose name the first settlement is thought to have adapted. The first real evidence of Bildeston is in the Domesday Book. The manor had been a royal estate of Queen Edith, consort of Edward the Confessor. By 1086 there were 20 households, composed of villeins, bordars and serfs, all dependent on Walter the Deacon, the absentee Lord of the Manor. Three plough teams belonged to the villagers, three to the lord and another to the priest, whose church was presumably where St Mary Magdalene‚Äôs is today. One hundred years later the church was said to have been re-built by Lady Helewise de Gwerres, whose family, the Loveynes, later became the lords of the Manor. Despite mythology explaining the move of the village down to the Brett valley as being caused by the Black Death of 1349, Matthew de Loveyne, then lord of the manor, was granted a charter for a market on the Stowmarket to Hadleigh Road in 1264. The move was to be more gradual and possibly more to do with easily accessible water. When the Revett family took over the manor in 1603 only the manor house and the church remained on the comparatively bleak hill, although houses on the road to the church were shown on early 19th century maps. Bildeston became famous for blue broadcloth and buildings housing dyers, weavers, shearmen, spinners and clothiers were erected to form Chapel Street and Duke Street during the 15th and 16th centuries. Also constructed was a wool hall where the commerce of the wool trade was conducted. It is very similar to the one that can be seen restored to its original form as part of the Swan Hotel in nearby Lavenham. The Bildeston Hall still survives but is now split into two private residences on the corner of High Street and Ipswich Road. Early enclosure of agricultural land had created a landless population for enterprising landlords to profit by. But by the reign of Queen Mary (1553‚Äì58) scarcity and high prices lead to reports 'whereby this town of Bilstone hath decayed'. Changes in fashion and foreign policy that interrupted trade meant the main employment became the supplying of yarn to Norwich instead of quality cloth to London. By 1674 two thirds of households were living in poverty and many were taken into the village workhouse. The Crown Inn became a centre for the casual hiring of farm labourers and domestic servants. The weekly Wednesday market failed in 1764 and traveller John Kirby described Bildeston as 'a town in a bottom, meanly built and the streets are dirty'. The manor house was demolished, following the death of Bartholomew Beale the last lord of the manor 40 years before. The Cooke family of Polstead ostensibly took over the rents and the profits of the fair, but took little interest in the village. The last fair was held in 1872, with just one stall. So called 'professional' people settled in the 19th century, there were plans to build a railway station on Dansford Meadow and the Riot Act was read during the 1885 elections. Bildeston, like so many other Suffolk villages, had survived a long period of decline, to again achieve relative affluence. ===Bildeston Hall=== Bildeston Hall, occasional home to lords who often had interests elsewhere, was to the south west of the church. Ploughing in 1974 removed remains of a circular moat and what may have been a fish pond, but did produce pottery from the 11th to 17th centuries. The crop marks, seen from the air, can still reveal the site of the original Bildeston. ===Present day=== Today, Bildeston is a thriving village once more, boasting a post office and general provisions shop and three pubs. The King's Head, a Grade II listed freehouse dating from around 1530, organises an annual beer festival at the end of May. The other pubs in the village are a gastropub The Crown and The Red Lion. Previously known as The Lion, the Red Lion is a traditional 16th-century locals' pub with the current building thought to mainly date from the 18th century. The pub was situated in Wattisham, until 18 August 1882, when a detached portion of that parish was incorporated into Bildeston Parish; it was the only building in the detached portion of Wattisham.https://suffolk.camra.org.uk/pub/61 ==St Mary Magdalene Church== St Mary Magdalene Church now stands isolated, about half a mile from Bildeston. On the morning of 8 May 1975 the church tower collapsed. The tower was undergoing radical maintenance at the time, and the medieval bells had already been removed. The replacement tower is topped by a bare, functional box, with a slender little spire on top. The south porch has grand flushwork, a testimony to 15th century piety and Marian devotion. The doorway must be among the best in the county of its period. St Mary‚Äôs also boasts a glorious window by the Kempe workshop, depicting the Annunciation and richly adorned with subsidiary scenes. On 23 January 1958, the church was designated as a Grade I listed building, the highest ranking and one denoting a building of exceptional interest. ==References== ==External links== *Village website Category:Villages in Suffolk Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk Category:Babergh ","title":"Bildeston"},{"id":"3258736","text":"Rostraver Airport is a public use airport in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. == Geography == It is located five nautical miles (9 km) east of the central business district of Monongahela, Pennsylvania in Rostraver Township.

Loringhoven was a friend of Claus von Stauffenberg, who was the leader of the 20 July Plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944. ==Biography== Loringhoven came from an aristocratic Baltic German family in Courland, the Frydag, that was descended from Westphalia. He was born in the Gro√ü Born Manor, Courland Governorate (in now Lielborne) but grew up in Adiam√ºnde Manor (in now Skulte) in Livonia. After his Final Exams (Abitur), Loringhoven joined the Baltic- German Army (Landeswehr) in 1918, and with the formation of independent Latvia he became an officer of the 13th Infantry Regiment of Latvia and participated in liberation of Latgale. After Latvian agrarian reforms in 1920 and subsequent nationalisation of manor lands he decided to leave Latvia in 1922 in order to enter the Army of Weimar Germany (Reichswehr). Loringhoven initially sympathized with the National Socialist program for Germany. But, in 1934, he was disaffected by the Night of the Long Knives massacre. After more negative experiences with war crimes during the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), Loringhoven joined the resistance against Nazi Germany. In 1943, with the help of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, Loringhoven was relocated to the High Command of the German Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW) as a colonel. ===20 July plot=== Loringhoven provided the detonator charge and explosives for the assassination attempt against Hitler on 20 July 1944. He was able to obtain captured British explosives from German intelligence (Abwehr) sources. British explosives were used in order to make it harder to detect who had supplied them, and also to imply that the British were involved in the plot, thereby diverting attention from the actual conspirators. Nonetheless, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt; RSHA), discovered the actions of Loringhoven. On 26 July 1944, immediately before he was to be arrested by the Gestapo and fully aware of the interrogation techniques utilized by them, Loringhoven committed suicide at Mauerwald in East Prussia. ===Aftermath=== After his death, Loringhoven's wife was imprisoned along with relatives of the other members of the plot. Loringhoven's four sons were separated from their mother. All were eventually liberated by Allied forces. A close cousin, Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven, was not implicated only due to the intervention of General Heinz Guderian. His cousin was an occupant of the F√ºhrerbunker in Berlin towards the end of World War II in Europe. Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven escaped Berlin, was captured by the British, and survived the war. ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * Astaf von Transehe-Roseneck u.a.: Genealogisches Handbuch der Baltischen Ritterschaften.

California mixed evergreen forest is an plant community found in the mountain ranges of California and southwestern Oregon. The Mixed evergreen forest plant community is native to the Northern and Southern California Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada of central and northern California; the Transverse Ranges and Peninsular Ranges of southern California; and the southwestern Oregon Coast Ranges. California mixed evergreen forests occur in ecoregions of the California Floristic Province, including in areas of the California chaparral and woodlands and its sub-ecoregions, Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains forests, Northern California coastal forests, and Sierra Nevada lower montane forest. The mixed evergreen forests of each ecoregion have slightly different species composition. ==Klamath-Siskiyou mixed evergreen forest== The mixed evergreen forests of the Klamath Mountains-Siskiyou Mountains occur above 300 meters (1000 ft) elevation, and are of four main types. Douglas-fir forests are found on gentle slopes, north-facing slopes, ridges with deep soil, and river terraces with deep sediments, usually underlain with sedimentary rocks. Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii ssp. menziesii) is the predominant tree, occupying up to 70% of the forest cover. Broadleaf evergreen trees are relatively few. Tree species of secondary importance are: *Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), *Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), *White fir (Abies concolor). On granite soils, a similar species composition predominates, but with more broadleaf evergreens, chiefly: *Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora) and *Canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis), along with *Giant chinquapin (Chrysolepis chrysophylla). On steep, well drained slopes, canyon live oak is the dominant species, with coast Douglas-fir in a minor role. On serpentine soils, mixed evergreen forests are made up of: :moister areas *Lawson's cypress (also known as Port Orford cedar, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) and *Western white pine (Pinus monticola) :drier areas *Incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), *Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), *Knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata). ==California Coast Ranges mixed evergreen forest== Mixed evergreen forests in the California Coast Ranges vary in species related to coastal (Outer Ranges) or inland (Inner Ranges) climate influences. It usually happens in the elevation from 0 meter to 500 meters high. Mountains in the San Francisco Bay Area frequently support mixed evergreen forests. Generally the moister the forest habitat the greater the understory density. Coast mixed evergreen is drier than coast redwood and it is a four-layer forest structure. The conifers are usually emergent as canopy layer and broad-leaf evergreen trees emerge as sub-canopy layer. The shrubs occur as the understory species. :Those closer to the coast receiving adequate fog moisture and high rainfall generally will feature the following species: *Coast Douglas-fir, *Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) *Tanoak, (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) *Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), *California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), *Canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis), *Interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii), *Coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), *Black oak (Q. kelloggii), *Oregon oak (Q. garryana) *Big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). :Further inland, on north facing slopes or protected canyons, these forests are drier and generally lack tanoak, Douglas fir, and coast redwood. Species typical of the drier neighboring oak woodlands join the mix: *Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri) or *Gray pine (Pinus sabiniana) Common wildlife include Steller's jay, chestnut-backed chickadee, western gray squirrel, raccoon and many others. These forests are more diverse in animal life than those having only conifers. The predominance of broadleaf trees provide a greater abundance of food sources. ==Southern Coast, Transverse, and Peninsular Ranges mixed evergreen forest== Also called southern mixed evergreen forests, the mixed evergreen forests of the southern California Coast Ranges, the Transverse Ranges, and the northern Peninsular Ranges, are restricted to cooler north-facing slopes at higher elevations. :Predominant tree species include: *Tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) *Madrone (Arbutus menziesii) *Canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) *Coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) *California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) * Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) *Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri) *Bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa). ==See also== * Mixed coniferous forest * * ==References== ==External links== * Las Pilitas Native Plant Nursery: Info on California mixed evergreen forest * Plant Communities of Mount Diablo - Mixed Evergreen Forest Category:Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the United States Category:Plant communities of California * Category:California chaparral and woodlands . . *P Category:Montane forests ","title":"California mixed evergreen forest"},{"id":"3258771","text":"The decidua is the modified mucosal lining of the uterus (that is, modified endometrium) that forms in preparation for pregnancy. It is formed in a process called decidualization under the influence of progesterone. Endometrial cells become highly characteristic. The decidua forms the maternal part of the placenta and remains for the duration of the pregnancy. It is shed off during childbirth ‚Äî hence why the term is used, \\"decidua\\" having the meaning of falling away, as in the word deciduous. ==Structure== The part of the decidua that interacts with the trophoblast is the decidua basalis (also called decidua placentalis), while the decidua capsularis grows over the embryo on the lumenal side, enclosing it into the endometrium. The remainder of the decidua is termed the decidua parietalis or decidua vera, and it will fuse with the decidua capsularis by the fourth month of gestation. Three morphologically distinct layers of the decidua basalis can then be described: * Compact outer layer (stratum compactum) * Intermediate layer (stratum spongiosum) * Boundary layer adjacent to the myometrium (stratum basalis) Within the decidua, occasional fibrinoid deposits form where the syncytiotrophoblast is damaged. The region of fibrinoid deposition where trophoblasts meet the compact portion of the decidua basalis is called Rohr's layer, while the fibrinoid deposits that occur between the compact and spongy layer of the decidua basalis is termed Nitabuch's layer. This layer is absent in placenta accreta.Micrograph of decidualized endometrium due to exogenous progesterone. H&E; stain. The decidua has a histologically-distinct appearance, displaying large polygonal decidual cells in the stroma. These are enlarged endometrial stromal cells, which resemble epithelium (and are referred to as \\"epithelioid\\"). Decidualization includes the process of differentiation of the spindle-shape stromal fibroblasts into the plump secretory decidual cells, which create a pericellular extracellular matrix rich in fibronectin and laminin (similar to epithelial cells). Vascularity, as well as vascular permeability, is enhanced in the decidualizing endometrium. Its leukocyte population is distinct, with the presence of large endometrial granular leukocytes being predominant, while polynuclear leukocytes and B cells are scant. The large granular lymphocytes (CD56 bright) are called \\"uterine natural killer cells\\" or \\"uNK cells\\" in mice, and \\"decidual NK cells\\" or \\"dNK cells\\" in humans. ==Development== After ovulation, in placental mammals, the endometrial lining becomes hypertrophic and vascular under the influence of the sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone. In animals exhibiting hemochorial placentation, the endometrium undergoes decidualization following implantation. If implantation does not occur, the secretory lining will be absorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle). The decidua is shed with the placenta during birth. ==Function== As the maternal interface to the embryo the decidua participates in the exchanges of nutrition, gas, and waste with the gestation. It also protects the pregnancy from the maternal immune system. Further, the decidua has to allow a very controlled invasion of the trophoblast. In invasive placental disorders like placenta accreta decidualization have been consistently found to be deficient. ===Hormone production=== The decidua secretes hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. It has receptors for estrogen, progesterone, growth hormone, and others. Among its products are hormones commonly associated with other organs such as cortisol, CRF, GnRH, prolactin, and relaxin. Decidual prolactin is not under dopaminergic control. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) also called placental protein 12, and PAEP (glycodelin) appear to be specific products of the secretory and decidual lining. Other factors released include interleukin-15 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A reasonable understanding of the role and interplay of these hormones and factors has not been evolved. ===Other=== Micrograph of decidua in a lymph node. H&E; stain. *In case of an extrauterine pregnancy, the endometrium nevertheless becomes decidualized. A woman may shed the lining in the form of a decidual cast, which may be mistaken as a miscarriage, when, in fact, the ectopic pregnancy still persists. *A decidual reaction can be observed in tissue of the peritoneum and ovary during a pregnancy, and represents a response of stromal tissue to progesterone. *Decidua in a lymph node may mimic metastatic carcinoma. ==Clinical significance== Micrograph of chronic deciduitis.

Deborin oscillated between The Bolshevik and Menshevik factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, before settling with the Bolsheviks and enjoying a long career as a philosopher in the Soviet Union. Although this career suffered under Stalin, he lived to see his works republished when the Soviet Union was led by Nikita Khrushchev. ==Before the Russian Revolution== Entering the revolutionary movement by the end of the 1890s, Deborin joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in 1903. By 1907, however, he switched to the Menshevik faction and became known as one of Georgi Plekhanov's disciples, both in politics and philosophy. In 1908, Deborin graduated from the philosophy department at Bern University (L. I. Akselrod had received her doctorate there in 1900). He soon began publishing major books and articles on philosophy from a Marxist perspective. He then wrote \\"Filosofiia Makha\\" (Machist Philosophy), published in Golos sotst'aldemokrata, in April 1908. Here he characterised Bolshevism as a political manifestation of the 'subjectivism' and 'voluntarism' inherent in Machism, and that their \\"tacticians and practical people\\" were unwitting Machists and idealists. Lenin was one of the practical people who despite his rejection of \\"machism\\" had abided by a truce within the Bolshevik faction whereby they agreed not to politicise such philosophical issues. ==After the Russian Revolution== Soon after the October Revolution of 1917, Deborin left the Mensheviks and began lecturing at the Sverdlov University, the Institute of Red Professors and the Institute of Philosophy. He soon assumed editorial duties at the journal, Under the Banner of Marxism, which he headed from 1926-1931. Deborin joined the Communist Party in 1928. Following the 1917 October Revolution, Soviet philosophy found itself divided itself between two factions: the \\"dialecticians,\\" headed up by Deborin, and \\"mechanists,\\" whose leading figure was the philosopher Lyubov Akselrod (the then prominent Bolshevik leader Bukharin was seen as an ally of the \\"mechanists,\\" although he did not entirely agree with them). ==Under Stalin== In 1931, Joseph Stalin decided the issue of the debate between dialecticians and mechanists by publishing a decree which identified dialectical materialism as pertaining solely to Marxism-Leninism. He then codified it in Dialectical and Historical Materialism (1938) by enumerating the \\"laws of dialectics\\", which are the grounds of particular disciplines and in particular of the science of history, and which guarantees their conformity to the \\"proletarian conception of the world\\". Thus, diamat was imposed on most Communist parties affiliated to the Third International. Diamat became the official philosophy of the Soviet Union and remained as such until its dissolution. When Stalin decided in favor of dialectical materialism, Deborin made a show of support for Stalin's position. For some years afterwards, Deborin kept a low profile, and most of his writings were suppressed. However, he lived long enough to see all of his works republished in the Soviet Union during the \\"thaw\\" under Nikita Khrushchev. ==References== == External links == * Deborin's Biography * Deborin's photo ‚Äì from the Russian Academy of Sciences * Frederick Choate's website on Deborin * A.

The disused Grantham Canal passes through the village and there is a large basin adjacent to the main road. This would have facilitated loading and mooring when the canal was in use. The basin now attracts a substantial population of swans and ducks. Plans to put the canal back to water include the building of a swing bridge on the main road through the village. Like many bridges along the canal the original one has been flattened and therefore presently prevents navigation of the cut. Some nearby bridges, like the one elsewhere on this page, will need little work to put back to use. Further details of the plan for the area are available here: . Much of the village lies within a conservation area, which also contains 24 listed buildings. St Luke's Church dates from the 14th century.

His father, Lewis Hancock, was a prominent banker and served as the mayor of Austin, Texas from 1895 to 1897 while also creating the first public golf course, which today remains as the nine-hole Hancock Golf Course in central Austin. Lewis Hancock Jr. was born on October 15, 1889 in Austin, Texas. He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy from that state in 1906 and graduated in June 1910. He served in the battleship Vermont (BB-20) before being commissioned as an Ensign in March 1912, then underwent submarine instruction and served in the new submarine G-1. In 1913-1915 Ensign Hancock commanded the submarine C-2. Promoted to Lieutenant (Junior Grade) in 1915, he was Commanding Officer of the submarine L-4 in 1916-1918, receiving the Navy Cross for \\"distinguished service\\" in her during World War I combat operations against German U-boats. Later in 1918 Lieutenant Commander Hancock was Captain of another submarine, L-7. He also had wartime and post-war tours as a machinery inspector. During the first years of the 1920s, Hancock served in the battleships Georgia (BB-15) and Wyoming (BB-32), commanded the destroyer Sloat (DD-316) and had shore duty with the Navy Department and the Department of Commerce.

In the series the incumbent in the role is a disabled male British government official (played by Patrick Newell) who uses a wheelchair. He makes his debut in \\"The Forget-Me-Knot\\", which is Emma Peel's final episode and Tara King's first. In subsequent episodes he gives orders to John Steed and Tara King. He appears in most episodes of series six, the last season of the series. He is an irascible yet highly intelligent character, and is a great admirer of Steed and especially his wine cellar. He has two elderly aunts whom, in the episode \\"Homicide and Old Lace\\", he entertains with stories of his department's cases. Patrick Newell had played various characters in previous episodes of The Avengers, most recently Sir George Collins, a sometime Minister of the Crown and close relative of the Attorney General, in season five's \\"Something Nasty in the Nursery\\". The 1998 film based on the series, also titled The Avengers, depicts Mother (played by Jim Broadbent) giving orders to Steed and Mrs Peel. == Bases and locations == In spite of his disability Mother seems mobile, continuously moving his location from more easily believable sites such as a stately home to eccentric ones such as a double-decker bus or under water. He has a new base in practically every episode. The plots of several episodes involve attempts to assassinate him, so these moves are presumably a security measure. == Other family members == The humour of \\"Mother\\" as a codename for a man is emphasized by having a blind female official called \\"Father\\" as the second to Mother in rank. Father appears in one episode of the series (\\"Stay Tuned\\") and in the 1998 film. In another episode of the series Mother refers to an associate named \\"Grandmother\\". == Rhonda == Mother's assistant is Rhonda, a tall blonde woman who never speaks. Mother comments on this in one episode (\\"Noon Doomsday\\"), saying that her quietness was lovely. When she tries to respond he stops her, instructing her not to spoil it. In \\"Homicide and Old Lace\\" Rhonda appears to speak, but this is revealed to be an act of ventriloquism on Mother's part. ==Reception== In the British Film Institute's 1996 tribute book, The Avengers, Toby Miller writes: \\"The nicest deviation from classic detective fiction comes in the depthlessness of The Avengers: rather than seeking motivation through temporary occupancy of the criminal mind or a reconstruction of its psychic imbalances, perversities are simply dealth with when encountered. Nor does the team persuade a court of law or any organization that the truth has been established: they have executive power. When Miss King appears as Steed's fellow professional, and they work for a fully achieved administrative character in Mother, the series loses this concrete ambiguity that had so beautifully expressed the everydayness of governmentality. Mother had been designated as a cameo in 'The Forget-Me-Knot', but audience reaction was so powerful in the USA that he was written into the remainder of the series.\\" In Quite Quite Fantastic! The Avengers for Modern Viewers, Michael Scott Phillips also had a negative view: \\"Patrick Newell does a fine job but the character himself was to be mostly a pompous windbag that would only occasionally demonstrate charisma throughout the remainder of the series. As the future would show for the most part, the direction his new role indicated would fail; there was no need to turn backwards in the direction of his predecessors... This was supposedly encouraged by American executives at ABC who liked Mother. Bluntly, the show didn't need it.\\" == In other media == In Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, Harry Lime is in command of the British Secret Service acting as M but is nicknamed \\"Mother\\" by several agents, including Emma Peel. In the Tom Stoppard play Hapgood the (female) senior secret agent Hapgood also has the nickname or codename 'Mother'. ==Further reading== * The Complete Avengers: The Full Story of Britain's Smash Crime-Fighting Team! by Dave Rogers, St Martin's Press (1989) * The Avengers by Toby Miller, British Film Institute (1997) * The Avengers Files: The Official Guide by Andrew Pixley, Reynolds & Hearn (2004) * The Avengers: A Celebration: 50 Years of a Television Classic by Marcus Hearn, Titan Books (2010) * Avengerworld - The Avengers in Our Lives by Alan Hayes, Lulu (2016) * Quite Quite Fantastic!

Stephen and the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon were previously informed of the future attack by the Khan of the Crimean Khanate, Me√±li I Giray (1466-1515, with intermittence), who was an occasional ally of Stephen the Great, and had a clear stance against the Golden Horde. The hordes unleashed a three-directional attackStanislaus Sarnicius: Annales Seu De Origine Et Rebus Gestis Polonorum Et Lithuanorum : ‚ÄúThe Tatars from beyond the Volga, with their Khan Mamiak, crossing the river, had split into three armies: one towards Lithuania, other to Podolia, and the thirds to Moldavia.‚Äù via Podolia, being conducted by the brother and son of the Khan. They first raided and pillaged the eastern territories of Poland, and as Casimir failed to gather enough forces to attack them,Nicolae Costin: Letopise≈£ul ≈¢ƒÉrii Moldovei the Tatars then headed southwards against Moldavia. Chronicles speak of several clashes and two other battlesStanislaus Sarnicius: Annales Seu De Origine Et Rebus Gestis Polonorum Et Lithuanorum: ‚ÄúThe Moldavian Voivode beat them three times, catching the very son of the Khan.‚Äù both of which being won by the Moldavians. Nevertheless, the final and most violent was to take place at Lipin≈£i, a village near the Dniester, in the Soroca County, modern Republic of Moldova. By this time, the Tatars had started to retreat carrying into slavery several thousand women and children,Nicolae Costin in Letopise≈£ul ≈¢ƒÉrii Moldovei speaks of 10,000 people hundreds of herds of cattle, horses, and flocks of sheep. By August 20, Stephen managed to swerve this Tatar convoy, and to divert them to a trap set at the edge of the lime tree forest near Lipnic, and to force the Tatars to face the Moldavians in an open battle. There are no actual descriptions of the battle, but it is accounted as to have been a bloody and violent one. Large numbers from the ranks of both the Moldavians and of the Tatars perished. While most of the Tatars died in the battle itself, a large number of them actually drowned in the Dniester while attempting escape by fleeing. Numerous Tatars were captured, including the Khan‚Äôs son. The Khan‚Äôs brother died in the battle. ==Aftermath== Stephen conditioned the life of the Khan's son on his father's making peace with Moldavia, stating that his son would live until the exact day that a Tatar would touch the land of Moldavia. However, the Khan's son was eventually killed, after an episode at Stephens's court. This episode is mentioned by Stanislaus Sarnicius (Sarnicki),Stanislaus Sarnicius: Annales Seu De Origine Et Rebus Gestis Polonorum Et Lithuanorum as well as by Jan D≈Çugosz in his Historia Polonica: Mamak Khan failed to organize a new attack against Stephen. By 1502, the Great Horde was completely destroyed by Me√±li I Giray of the Crimean Khanate. Stephen took measures to protect his eastern frontier, strengthened the Orhei and Tighina fortresses, and built the Soroca fortress, thus completing the Eastern line of defence along the river Nistru. Tatar attacks continued against Moldavia, this time from the other Tataric states from north of the Black Sea. ==Footnotes and References== inline general *≈ûerban Papacostea: Rela≈£iile interna≈£ionale ale Moldovei in vremea lui ≈ûtefan cel Mare. *Collection of historic sources on stefancelmare.ro (Romanian) ==See also== *Tatar invasions *Moldavian military forces *Battle of the Vorskla River *Borze≈üti Church Category:1470 in Europe Lipnic 1470 Category:Conflicts in 1470 Lipnic Lipnic Category:Military history of Moldova ","title":"Battle of Lipnic"},{"id":"3258852","text":"Don't Come Knocking is a 2005 American drama road film directed by German director Wim Wenders and written by Wenders and actor/playwright Sam Shepard.TCM.com The two had previously collaborated on the film Paris, Texas (1984).Variety It was entered into the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== Shepard stars as Howard Spence, an aging, hard-living Western movie star, who, disgusted with his life & washed up, flees by horse from the set of his latest western filming in the desert outside Moab, Utah.

He was knighted in 2008 for his services to the retail industry and created a Conservative life peer on 17 September 2014, taking the title Baron Rose of Monewden, of Monewden in the County of Suffolk. In 2013, Rose became chair of online retailer Ocado. He remained chairman until July 2020, when it was reported in the media that he would step down. In October 2015, he was appointed chair of Britain Stronger in Europe, the official remain campaign in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. ==Early life== Rose's grandparents were White Russian √©migr√©s who fled to China after the 1917 revolution. Their son (later named Harry Ransom-Rose) was unofficially adopted by Nona Ransom - a Quaker from Bedford who served as English tutor to (among others) Empress Wanrong (the last Empress of China), and Shunryu Suzuki (the Japanese monk who later established the first Zen monastery outside East Asia).Letter from Harry Ransom-Rose to David Chadwick, February 1996 http://www.cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/other/nona/hr-on-nr.htm It was Nona who transported Harry to safety in England as war loomed. The original family name was Bryantzeff, which Rose's father, ex-RAF and civil servant, changed. His mother's side is English, Scottish and Greek. The young family lived in a caravan in Warwickshire until Rose senior obtained a posting with the Imperial Civil Service in Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Rose went to the Roman Catholic St Joseph's Convent School in Dar es Salaam until he was 11. When he was 13 years old his family returned to England and his parents sent him to Bootham School, an independent Quaker boarding school in York. His first job was as an administration assistant at the BBC. ==Career== Rose first joined Marks & Spencer in 1972, as a management trainee. Rose remained with Marks & Spencer until 1989, when he joined the Burton Group as Chief Executive in 1994. The Burton Group demerged, forming the Arcadia and Debenhams businesses. In 1997, he joined Argos as Chief Executive, where he was charged with defending the company against a takeover bid from the home shopping giant, Great Universal Stores (GUS). Ultimately, GUS did succeed in taking control of Argos, although Rose was praised for negotiating an increased price for the retailer. In a turbulent time in its history, Rose became the Chief Executive of Booker plc, where he oversaw the merger of the company with Iceland to form the Big Food Group. Rose joined the Arcadia Group in 2000 as Chief Executive and left in 2002 following its acquisition. Rose turned around the fortunes of the Arcadia Group, and sold the group for over ¬£800m, netting himself around ¬£25m as part of the deal. Rose received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2007. He was appointed to the position of Chief Executive of Marks & Spencer in May 2004 at the age of 56 and subsequently fought off takeover bids by Philip Green for the Group. For this role he was paid an annual salary of ¬£1,130,000. In January 2007, he was named the \\"2006 Business Leader of the Year\\" by the World Leadership Forum for his efforts in restoring the fortunes of Marks & Spencer. He was knighted in the 2008 New Year Honours and was appointed chairman of Business in the Community on 1 January 2008. On 10 March 2008, it was reported that Rose was to become executive chairman of Marks & Spencer from 1 June 2008. However, in the light of a recent profits warning, which sparked an unprecedented thirty per cent- plus plunge in the company's shares, this appointment caused some concern to many shareholders.Irish Times, 9 July 2008, p.19, Business Today Nevertheless, they voted to re-appoint him at their annual meeting on 9 July 2008. He stepped down as chief executive in May 2010, as executive chairman in July 2010, and as chairman in January 2011 following the appointment of Robert Swannell. On 19 January 2011, Rose was appointed as a non-executive director of Woolworths Holdings Ltd, a large South African retail group listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. On 6 September 2012, Rose was appointed as non- executive chairman of Dressipi.com, an online personalised fashion service that matches clothes and accessories to a shopper's shape, style and individual preferences. In 2013 Rose became an independent non-executive director and chairman of Ocado, the UK internet-only grocery retailer. He was recruited to advise the government on turning around failing hospitals, asked to examine how to improve the organisational culture in under-performing hospitals and ways to recruit talent from inside and outside the NHS in February 2014. In 2014, Rose was created a life peer and took a seat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords. In October 2015, Rose was appointed chair of Britain Stronger in Europe, the official remain campaign in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. After stating to a select committee in March 2016 that wages would go up should Britain leave the European Union, his public role was allegedly limited for the rest of the campaign. In 2019, Rose dismissed calls for a second referendum, stating that he 'believes in a democratic process', despite being a Remainer. On 14 July 2020, it was reported in the media that Lord Rose would step down from his role as chairman of Ocado. This is likely the end of his long career as a public company figurehead, although he remains on the board of Time Out Group, the listed leisure company, and chairs a number of privately held businesses. ==Personal life== When Rose was 26 years old his mother committed suicide at the age of 49 by taking an overdose combined with alcohol. She had a history of depression. Rose lives in central London and Suffolk. He married Jennifer Cook in 1973 in St Marylebone; the couple have a son and daughter. After they separated, Rose lived with fashion writer Kate Reardon. After separating from Reardon in 2009, and stepping down from his positions at M&S;, Rose and Jennifer divorced in 2010. On 16 July 2010, Rose was honoured by the University of Leeds, receiving an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the same university and venue from which his son graduated. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:British retail chief executives Category:People educated at Bootham School Category:English businesspeople in fashion Category:English businesspeople in retailing Category:English people of Greek descent Category:English chief executives Category:English people of Russian descent Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Living people Category:People from Gosport Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers ","title":"Stuart Rose"},{"id":"3258878","text":"The Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) are rules that are applicable to the domestic regulations a country applies to foreign investors, often as part of an industrial policy. The agreement, concluded in 1994, was negotiated under the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and came into force in 1995. The agreement was agreed upon by all members of the World Trade Organization. Trade-Related Investment Measures is one of the four principal legal agreements of the WTO trade treaty. TRIMs are rules that restrict preference of domestic firms and thereby enable international firms to operate more easily within foreign markets. Policies such as local content requirements and trade balancing rules that have traditionally been used to both promote the interests of domestic industries and combat restrictive business practices are now banned. == Origin == In the late 1980s, there was a significant increase in foreign direct investment across the world. However, some of the countries receiving foreign investment imposed numerous restrictions on that investment designed to protect and foster domestic industries, and to prevent the outflow of foreign exchange reserves. Examples of these restrictions include local content requirements (which require that locally produced goods be purchased or used), manufacturing requirements (which require the domestic manufacturing of certain components), trade balancing requirements, domestic sales requirements, technology transfer requirements, export performance requirements (which require the export of a specified percentage of production volume), local equity restrictions, foreign exchange restrictions, remittance restrictions, licensing requirements, and employment restrictions. These measures can also be used in connection with fiscal incentives as opposed to requirement. Some of these investment measures distort trade in violation of GATT Articles III and XI, and are therefore prohibited. Until the completion of the Uruguay Round negotiations, which produced a well-rounded Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (hereinafter the \\"TRIMs Agreement\\"), the few international agreements providing disciplines for measures restricting foreign investment provided only limited guidance in terms of content and country coverage. The OECD Code on Liberalization of Capital Movements, for example, requires members to liberalize restrictions on direct investment in a range of areas. The OECD Code's efficacy, however, is limited by the numerous reservations made by each of the members. In addition, there are other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral, under which signatories extend most-favored-nation treatment to direct investment. Only a few such treaties, however, provide national treatment for direct investment. The Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation Investment Principles adopted in November 1994 are general rules for investment but they are non-binding. ==See also== *Bilateral Investment Treaty

As an adopted stray cat, he was the only pet of the Clintons during the early years of the administration, and his likeness hosted the children's version of the White House website. After Clinton left office, Socks resided with former Clinton secretary Betty Currie and her husband, owing to continuing conflicts with the Clintons' dog Buddy. == Biography == Socks was born in 1989. He was adopted by the Clintons in 1991 after he jumped into the arms of Chelsea Clinton as she was leaving the house of her piano teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was playing with his sibling, Midnight, who was later adopted by another family. When Bill Clinton became president, Socks moved with the family from the governor's mansion to the White House and became the principal pet of the First Family in Clinton's first term, though he was known to share his food and water with a stray tabby, dubbed Slippers. He was often taken to schools and hospitals. During the Clinton administration, children visiting the White House website would be guided by a cartoon version of Socks. He eventually lost the position of principal Clinton pet in 1997 when the Clintons acquired Buddy, a Labrador Retriever. Socks found Buddy's intrusion intolerable: according to Hillary Clinton, Socks \\"despised Buddy from first sight, instantly and forever.\\" Bill Clinton said, \\"I did better with the Palestinians and the Israelis than I've done with Socks and Buddy.\\" When the Clintons left the White House in 2001 they took Buddy to their new home, but left Socks under the care of Bill Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie. Buddy would die within a year, being hit by a car in 2002. In December 2002, Socks was part of the Little Rock Christmas parade. In October 2004, Socks made a then-rare public appearance when Currie was guest speaker at an Officers' Spouses Club luncheon at Andrews Air Force Base. Socks accompanied her and took part in a photo op. In June 2008, Socks was still living with Currie and her husband in Hollywood, Maryland, about 60 miles from Washington, but had a thyroid condition, hair loss, weight loss, and kidney problems.\\"Socks still rocks\\", Southern Maryland Newspapers Online, June 6, 2008. In December 2008, Socks was reported to be in failing health, apparently suffering from cancer.\\"Clinton's Socks the Cat Near Death\\", U.S. News, December 12, 2008. Socks was euthanized on February 20, 2009, in Hollywood, Maryland, after suffering cancer of the jaw. It was also estimated that Socks would have turned 20 in the spring of 2009, placing his birthdate in the spring of 1989 rather than 1990. ==Investigation== Representative Dan Burton, then the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, once publicly questioned the use of White House staff, postage, and stationery to answer mail addressed to the cat. ==Cultural references== First Lady Hillary Clinton carried a Socks-shaped minaudi√®re to the 1996 Inaugural Ball. It was designed by Judith Leiber, a designer famous for her whimsically-shaped rhinestone- encrusted evening bags. The bag is currently on display at the Amsterdam Museum of Bags and Purses. Hillary Clinton wrote a children's book called Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets in 1998.Clinton, Hillary, Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets, Simon & Schuster, 1998, , It included more than 50 letters written to the First Pets by children and more than 80 photographs of Socks and Buddy. A cartoon book called Socks Goes to Washington: The Diary of America's First Cat, written by Michael O'Donoghue and Jean-Claude Suares, was published in 1993. Socks Goes to the White House ‚Äì A Cats-eye view of the President's house, written by Kenneth T. Blackshaw with illustrations by Mary Beth Burns was published in 1993. Socks was a character in If..., Steve Bell's cartoon strip in The Guardian, where he was described as the \\"world's most powerful cat,\\" and as \\"Chief of Staff for Fish.\\" Socks was featured prominently in an episode of the sitcom Murphy Brown in December 1993 entitled \\"Sox and the Single Girl,\\" in which Socks is inadvertently removed from the White House during a press dinner.\\"Murphy Brown\\": Sox and the Single Girl at TV.com On the April 1, 1994, edition of Larry King Live, a Muppet version of Socks was a special guest interviewed by Kermit the Frog, who was guest hosting for Larry King at the time. In 1996, Socks appeared on a series of stamps in the Central African Republic with Bill Clinton. On the 1994 Oscar Brand album I Love Cats the song, \\"Socks' Song\\" is dedicated to Socks. In Berkeley Breathed's comic strip Outland, Socks was involved in a homosexual affair with Bill the Cat. They appeared together on a talk show, along with Checkers Nixon, Rex Reagan, and Millie Bush, on the topic of \\"Gay Presidential Pets.\\" The video clip for the song \\"Blister in the Sun\\" by the band the Violent Femmes, used in the movie Grosse Pointe Blank, depicts an obsessive fan donning a Socks costume and attempting to assassinate Socks while he was speaking in public (Socks survives the incident unscathed while the would-be assassin is apprehended). In an episode of Eek! The Cat, an attempt is made on Socks' life. Eek learns that the prospective killer is a deranged Checkers, the black and white Presidential dog, who still holds a grudge over being humiliated in Richard Nixon's famous 1952 Checkers speech and wishes to make all Presidential pets pay. Socks was to be the subject of a canceled 1993 video game entitled Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill for the Super NES and Sega Genesis platforms. In his announcement of the Next Generation Internet Initiative in 1996, Bill Clinton said: \\"When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the World Wide Web. Now even my cat has its own page.\\" The women's clothing brand Soccx, produced by the German company Clinton Gro√ühandels-GmbH, was named after Socks. The company's other brands, Camp David and Chelsea, are also references to the Clintons.

He was elected leader of the New Politics Party (NPP). Starting his career as a journalist, he later founded Manager Daily newspaper as well as satellite broadcaster ASTV. Originally a strong supporter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, he later became a leader of the anti-Thaksin movement. Under his leadership, the PAD was the major player in the 2005‚Äì2006 Thai political crisis that led to the 2006 military coup that toppled the Thaksin government. When Thaksin-affiliated parties won the 2007 general election, Sondhi became the major player in the 2008‚Äì2009 Thai political crisis, leading the PAD in violent clashes with security forces and anti-PAD protestors as well as the seizure of Government House, Don Muang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Sondhi is more or less a supporter of the Democrat Party and stopped the PAD's protests after Democrat leader Abhisit Vejjajiva was appointed Prime Minister. In April 2009, Abhisit faced massive anti-government protests led by the pro-Thaksin red shirts which caused the Fourth East Asia Summit to be canceled and was followed by riots in Bangkok. Days after the Bangkok unrest was quelled by military force, gunmen ambushed Sondhi's car, a black Toyota Vellfire, at a petrol station. They shot out the tires, and fired over 100 M-16 and AK-47 assault rifle rounds at the car. The attackers escaped from the scene when Sondhi's followers in another car opened fire on them. Sondhi suffered a serious head wound but remained conscious, standing and lucid before being sent to a hospital for emergency surgery.The Times, Thailand's Yellow Shirt leader Sondhi Limthongkul survives assassination attempt, 17 April 2009 Sondhi survived the surgery, which involved removing several bullet fragments embedded about half a centimetre deep in his skull. It is not certain who was behind the shooting, though Sondhi's son and PAD's spokesmen speculated that a faction of the military or police might have been behind it.Matichon, \\"‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏¥\\"‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ú‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏î-‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏†‡∏±‡∏¢‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß ‡∏û‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏®‡∏©‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ô‡∏ù‡∏±‡∏á‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß4‡∏ä‡∏¥‡πâ‡∏ô ‡∏Ñ‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏µ‡∏Å6‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å ‡∏£‡∏û.‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏ñ‡∏•‡πà‡∏°‡∏£‡∏ñ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ô Thai Talk On 6 September 2016, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled that he must serve the 20 years in prison sentence ruled by the Appeals Court in 2012, when he was freed on bail. The sentence, according to the Supreme Court, will not be suspended. He was found guilty of violating the Securities and Exchange Act by falsifying documents in 1997 to secure a loan from Krung Thai Bank amounting to 1.08 billion baht. ==The media mogul== Sondhi founded Manager Daily in 1982 after several ventures in publishing. The newspaper became his personal mouthpiece, and he used the profits to build a publishing, broadcasting, and telecommunications empire. During Bloody May in 1992, Sondhi and his media played a significant role in opposing the then military government's crackdown on protesters, issuing a free special tabloid on the events when the government threatened to shut down his newspaper. By 1996, he had over US$600 million in assets. His business faced a meltdown following the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, forcing him into bankruptcy and sparking investigations into irregular inter- company transactions. Immediately after the crisis, Sondhi furiously attacked the Democrat-led government over its management of the economic recovery. With the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as Prime Minister in 2001, several of Sondhi's associates became leaders in the new government. His banker, Viroj Nualkhair, became president of state-owned Krung Thai Bank and gave more than a billion baht in \\"debt forgiveness\\" to Sondhi, allowing him to emerge from bankruptcy. Sondhi became a vocal supporter of Thaksin, calling him \\"the best prime minister our country has ever had.\\"The Nation, Old views haunt govt critic , 7 December 2005 In 2005, Viroj Nualkhair was dismissed from the KTB after incurring over 40 billion baht in problem loans. Sondhi then began criticizing Thaksin using the media under his control, including satellite broadcaster ASTV. He founded the People's Alliance for Democracy, aimed at overthrowing the Thaksin government. The PAD cancelled their activities after a military coup overthrew Thaksin. However, when Thaksin-affiliated parties won a post-coup election, and vowed to revise the new constitution, which they claimed was 'undemocratic', the PAD reformed and renewed its protests. In 2008, Sondhi and PAD demonstrators occupied Government House and barricaded themselves inside for months. They later seized Don Muang Airport and Suvarnabhumi Airport and closed them for several days, stranding thousands of travelers. At the height of the protests, the PAD declared the only person they would accept as Premier was Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the opposition Democrat Party.Bloomberg, Oxford Graduate Abhisit Elected in Thai Power Shift, 19 December 2008 The protests ended when the Constitutional Court banned the People's Power Party for corruption.

His paternal grandfather was born in Hainan before settling in Sukhothai and marrying a Thai woman. Sondhi‚Äôs Thai-born father was sent to study in China and eventually became a Kuomintang army officer after training at Whampoa Military Academy; he later returned to Thailand during the Chinese Communist Revolution and married a Hainan-born woman who was Sondhi‚Äôs mother.Kasian Tejapira, Toppling Thaksin, NLR 39, May- June 2006The misbehaving jeks: The evolving regime of Thainess and Sino-Thai challengesThailand‚Äôs Sondhi Running Out of Time After Latest Conviction Are We Them? Textual and Literary Representations of the Chinese in Twentieth-Century Thailand Sondhi majored in history at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a reporter for the student newspaper, The Daily Bruin, from 1966 to 1969. He received his M.A. degree from Utah State University in 1972. Returning to Thailand, he worked for the newspaper Prachatipatai (Democracy) as a reporter and managing editor in 1973 and 1974. He wrote several expos√©s of the political developments that led to the student protests and bloodshed on October 14, 1973, an event which brought down the military government of Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn and led to a restoration of democracy. In 1976, he set up the Advance Media Group with real estate investor Paul Sittiamnuay. The group produced four publications, including a short-lived English-language daily called Business Times (not connected with the current Business Times), with Sondhi as an editor. The newspaper collapsed after Paul Sittiamnuay was investigated over a real estate scandal, went bankrupt and fled the country. In 1979, Sondhi set up his own company, Karawek, which published a women's magazine, Pooying, from 1980 to 1982. ==The Manager era (1982-1997)== In 1982, Sondhi established the business monthly Phoojatkarn (Manager), which he produced in a room in his father's house. Phoojatkarn Monthly was soon a success, and four years later Sondhi began a weekly with the same name. He later published a daily newspaper, Phoojadkarn Rai Wan. Phoojatkarn Daily has often been regarded as Sondhi's personal mouthpiece. Sondhi eventually established a publishing house called the Manager Group (also known as the M Group), as a holding company for his media outlets. Among the companies he purchased were the IT firms SCT and Micronetic, and the handset retailer IEC. IEC was the exclusive handset retailer for Nokia phones, and its major customers were the two rival mobile- phone groups Advanced Info Service, which belonged to future prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and Total Access Communication (later known as DTAC). During this period, Sondhi also expanded into English-language publishing, with an English edition of Manager, the Hong Kong-based monthly Asia Inc, and a regional daily newspaper the Asia Times. He briefly owned a local lifestyle magazine in Los Angeles known as Buzz. Sondhi was characterized in the media as an \\"Asian Rupert Murdoch,\\" and he hired aggressively, bringing in both Asian and Western journalists. Asia Inc was eventually sold, and went through several ownership changes. It is currently owned by Singapore-based Edge Asia Inc Media Group. The Asia Times folded in 1997, though an online edition, run by some of the paper's former staff, continues to operate Asia Times Online. Before taking IEC public in 1992, Sondhi allotted a 17.5 per cent stake in the company to Thaksin. Thaksin bought the stake at Bt10 per share. After the listing, IEC's share price shot up to THB 250 each and Thaksin sold out his stake. Sondhi said Thaksin made between THB 600 million to THB 700 million from the IEC float. Sondhi wrote in his book, \\"One Must Know How To Lose Before Knowing How To Win\\", that he felt that Thaksin was a free rider and did not want to do business with him. The Manager Group-led Asia Broadcasting and Communications Network (ABCN) set up its satellite project, Lao Star Co - which was worth about THB 9 billion - as a joint venture with the Laotian government in 1995. Lao Star appointed Space System/Loral to build two L-Star satellites and L-Star 1 was set to officially launch to provide digital direct-to-home TV programmes in 1998. L-Star 2 was to be put into orbit in 1999. The project was planned to serve around 2 billion people in the Asia Pacific region, including India and China. Later ABCN enlisted DTAC's parent, United Communication Industry Plc (Ucom), to back its business. IEC also provided a bulk of the mobile-phone airtime to DTAC before purchasing the 1800 MHz frequency from DTAC to develop its own mobile-phone operator Wireless Communication Service (WCS). WCS offered the service under the brand Digital 01. Sondhi expanded and diversified widely. He owned a hotel in China's Yunnan province, ran a cement factory in Vietnam, and set up a regional business conference company. Most of his investments were woven in a complex series of cross-shareholdings. Sondhi himself kept few direct holdings in any of the companies, but was ultimately in control through his ownership of holding companies like M Group and other holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. Such a structure minimized Sondhi's tax bill and provided maximum protection in case of financial difficulties.The Nation, Speedy demise for Sondhi's empire, 12 April 2002 In 1996, Fortune magazine had put Sondhi's assets at US$600 million (or THB 12 billion at the exchange-rate of THB 25 to a US dollar). He received an honorary doctorate from Chiang Mai University. He often travelled around Thailand in a chartered personal business jet from Thai Airways and was often seen escorting Chinese movie star Gong Li.The Nation, \\"Speedy demise for Sondhi‚Äôs empire\\", 12 April 2002 ==Bankruptcy and anti- Democrat period (1997-2001)== Following the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Sondhi's satellite and publishing businesses faced a meltdown. His WCS was sold to the CP Group before it was renamed TA Orange and later became True Move. The Manager Group was saddled with THB 20 billion in debt but only THB 4 billion in equity. The Manager Group's holding company alone had liabilities of THB 6 billion. Manager Media had Bt4.7 billion in debt. Sondhi was personally in debt for THB 1.5 billion. Sondhi ended up declaring himself bankrupt for three years. This meant that his THB 1.5 billion debt could be claimed from whatever was in his personal account for a span of three years, rather than having to repay the debt over 15 or 20 years as earlier scheduled. Sondhi's companies were also investigated for irregular inter-company transactions. IEC guaranteed a THB 1.2 billion baht loan by M group in 1996, but never disclosed this guarantee to the public. M Group later defaulted on the loan, sending IEC into bankruptcyTroubled Company Reporter, \\"SET orders loan guarantee report\\", 1 November 1999 Auditors of Eastern Printing, Sondhi's SET-listed printing company, noted that its huge losses partially stemmed from loans to associated companies and the establishment of off-balance accounts to related publishing companies. For example, in its 2000 financial statement, Sondhi-linked companies Asia Inc and FRYE Smith (USA) Co owed Bt59.86 million and Bt125.79 million respectively to Eastern Printing. Likewise, according to its 2000 financial statements, Manager Media lent Bt1.061 billion to related publishers, under guarantee from Sondhi.The Nation, \\"A fallen empire finds new lease on life\\", 10 April 2002 The Manager Group furiously attacked the Democrat-led government over its management of the economic crisis during its time in office from late 1997 to 2000. This included scathing attacks on Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhaeminda for his emergency financing agreements with the IMF and Deputy Prime Minister Sawit Bhodhivihok for his policy of privatizing the state-owned electricity sector. ==The Thaksin Era (2001-2006)== Sondhi in 2008 ===Pro-Thaksin Period=== After the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as Prime Minister in 2001, Manager Daily lauded Thaksin's leadership, calling him Thailand's best prime minister ever. Somkid Jatusripitak, co-founder of the Manager Media Group and writer of a column for Manager Daily became Thaksin's commerce and finance minister. Pansak Vinyaratan, previously editor of the now defunct Sondhi-owned Asia Times, became Thaksin's chief policy adviser. Chai-anan Samudavanija, who chaired IEC and was head of several of Sondhi's foundations, won prominent jobs at state- owned Krung Thai Bank and Thai Airways International. Kanok Abhiradee, the head of one of Sondhi's companies, became president of Thai Airways. Viroj Nualkhair, Sondhi's former banker, replaced Sirin Nimmanhaeminda as president of the state-owned Krung Thai Bank.The Nation Under Viroj's management, the debt that Manager Group owed to Krung Thai Bank was reduced from Bt1.8 billion to THB 200 million. Emerging from bankruptcy, Sondhi started his own TV show, 'Thailand Weekly' airing on MCOT's channel and co-hosted by Sarocha Pornudomsak. He also invested in two TV channels, 11/1 and 11/2 - a split from Television of Thailand Channel 11. A Democrat MP alleged that the Thaksin government gave favors to Sondhi and his companies. In July 2003, Sondhi wrote in his newspaper predicting the US Dollar's failure in 2010 and at the same time suggested Thai people invest in gold. ===Origins of the Anti-Thaksin Period=== Muangthai Rai Sapda at Suan Lumphini In 2004, state-owned Krung Thai Bank (KTB) shocked Thailand's financial world by reclassifying approximately Bt40 billion as problem loans. It was rumored that M.R. Pridiyathorn Devakula, the Bank of Thailand's governor, would fire KTB CEO Viroj Nualkhair if he did not resign voluntarily. Viroj Nualkhair was Sondhi's former financial advisor, having helped him IPO one of his first companies.The Nation, \\"New party, old friends aid Sondhi\\", 11 April 2002 As Krung Thai Bank's CEO, Viroj had forgiven Sondhi's debts by Bt1.6 billion and arranged for further rounds of forgiveness. Using all of his media outlets, Sondhi furiously attacked Pridiyathorn and defended Viroj. However, Viroj was eventually forced to leave Krung Thai Bank. Sondhi's public criticism of Thaksin increased.The Nation, The good old days , 30 November 2005 Some claimed that the financial disagreement caused Sondhi's criticism of Thaksin's government. In July 2004, Sondhi's Channel 11/1 was temporarily ordered to stop broadcasting because of a contract dispute between cable operator UBC and the government regulator.Bangkok Post, UBC complies, drops channel, 2 July 2004 Bangkok Post, \\"UBC to resume televising Channel 11/1\\", 8 July 2004 Sondhi's criticism of Thaksin grew steadily throughout 2004 and 2005. He began criticizing Thaksin's government on the conflict of interest on the national petroleum company. With weekly critics on his Muangthai Rai Sapda (Thailand Weekly) television show, Thaksin's opposition received much attention. In September 2005, MCOT (broadcaster of Channel 9), in response to allegations that Muangthai Rai Sapda had made inappropriate references to the monarchy, cancelled the program.The Nation, \\"Ch 9 drops Sondhi for royal references\\", 16 September 2005 However, Sondhi felt he was dropped for criticising the Thaksin government. He subsequently started broadcasting his talk show via satellite and webcasting it on the website of one of his newspapers, doubling his daily number of site visitors. The event became the magnet for oppositions of Thaksin's government. ===The Luang Ta Maha Bua incident=== On 27 September 2005, Phoochatkarn Daily published a sermon by Luang Ta Maha Bua, a popular but outspoken Buddhist monk. The sermon was seen by many as extremely critical of Thaksin, especially as it came from a monk. Especially controversial were the following passages: \\"They complained to me about PM Thaksin and Mr. Visanu and two other people that I don't remember. This is the big ogre (), big power. Atrocious power will swallow our country, bite the liver and lungs and aim for the presidency ... He will put a torch to the country. He will never listen ... This savagery and atrocity appear in every aspect of him ... All he has are things to be used for burning.\\" \\"He is clearly aiming for the presidency now. The monarch trampled, the religion trampled, the country trampled, by this savage and atrocious power in a few people in the government circle. That is the circle of ogres, of ghosts, of trolls, of demons (), all in there ... So even Devadatta [an enemy of the Buddha] saw the harm he caused, and he was rewarded for his good deed. He would attain Buddhahood (). For those who have made mistakes, if we see the harm we cause, we can still get by. But what is it with Thailand? What kind of governance?\\" \\"They even dare to accuse Luangta Maha Bua of playing politics. Politics, dog shit (). There's only shit all over the country. I brought the Buddha's dharma to cleanse in order for them to repent and recognize good and evil. Because they're the government. The world flatters them as smart people, but don't be smart down in the toilet (). Don't be smart about putting a torch to the head of everyone in the country, from Nation, Religion, and Monarchy on down. These people will get burned unless they recognize the truth. I'm saddened by all this. How does this come about?\\" Thailand has no office of a presidency. The King is the head of state, and the prime minister is the head of government. A president would replace the King - an unthinkable affront to the Thais' reverence for their monarchy. Accusations of aspiration to a presidency are one of the most severe and rare criticisms a Thai politician can receive. On 11 October 2005, Thaksin sued Sondhi and Manager newspaper for Bt500 million. As monks have traditionally been above criticism, Thaksin could not sue Luang Ta Maha Bua. \\"This is an exercise of an individual's right to protect his reputation and privacy. The newspaper did not criticise the prime minister fairly as a public official, but rather it took him to task personally, using harsh words, which was damaging to him,\\" said Thana Benjathikul, Thaksin's lawyer. Thaksin was immediately attacked by Sondhi and accused of gagging the press. Sondhi's lawyer, Suwat Apaipakdi, said that \\"every newspaper reproduced his [Luang Ta Maha Bua] comments. Why did Thaksin not sue him [Luang Ta Maha Bua]? He chose to sue only the Manager Media Group because it's linked to Khun Sondhi\\". Thaksin's legal team noted that other newspapers only published selected passages of the sermon, and furthermore, Sondhi had used an allegedly slanderous headline. Respected civil rights lawyer Thongbai Thongpao noted that Thaksin's lawsuit did have merit. He said the lawsuits \\"do not constitute an attack on freedom of the press\\". The lawsuit, along with several other libel cases, was withdrawn after King Bhumibol Adulyadej indirectly advised against such legal action during his annual birthday speech. === The Royal Power / Temple of the Emerald Buddha incident === On 10 April 2005, Thaksin Shinawatra presided over a merit-making ceremony at the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, which is within the walls of the Grand Palace and contains the most revered Buddha figure in Thailand. Starting October 2005, the website of Manager newspaper ran an article alleging that the Prime Minister had usurped a royal function of the King by presiding over the ceremony. This led Sondhi to start using \\"We Love the King\\", \\"We Will Fight for the King\\", and \\"Return Power to the King\\" as his key anti-Thaksin rallying slogans. This allegation has been repeated in Sondhi's \\"Thailand Weekly\\" live tapings. It also became a staple of the thaiinsider.com website of Ekkayuth Anchanbutr, operator of the Charter pyramid scheme. A widely circulated anonymous spam email showed a picture of Thaksin sitting on a chair normally used by the King and asking, \\"People are familiar with images only of the King and members of the Royal Family, all dressed in royal uniforms and decorated with full regalia, presiding over grand ceremonies in the temple's main chapel. Yet this picture makes me think: What has happened to our country?\\". On 9 November 2005, Cabinet secretary-general Bovornsak Uwanno, without showing any evidence, claimed that King Bhumibol Adulyadej had granted permission to Prime Minister Thaksin to preside over a grand merit-making ceremony. This was corroborated by Chaktham Thammasak, who was director-general of the Bureau of National Buddhism at the time of the event. Chaktham stated that the Royal Household Bureau arranged every aspect of the ceremony, including the positioning of the chairs. On 17 November 2005, the Civil Court issued a gag order on Sondhi to prevent him from making further \\"royal powers\\" allegations. This immediately prompted Sondhi to attack Thaksin and accuse him of restricting press freedom. Sondhi was investigated on two counts of lese-majesty against King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Counter-charges of lese-majesty were filed against Prime Minister Thaksin. On 18 November, Supreme Commander General Ruengroj Mahasaranond harshly warned Sondhi against using the King as a political tool. \\"Our patience is reaching the breaking point. We may take action if Sondhi does not cease his criticism by citing the monarchy\\". All charges were dropped after King Bhumibol Adulyadej advised against further action in his birthday speech on 5 December 2005. However, Sondhi continues to use \\"We Will Fight for the King\\" and \\"Return Power to the King\\" as rallying cries in his anti-Thaksin protests. ===Ongoing political activism=== : tank top with the anti-Thaksin slogan \\"We will fight for the King\\". Sondhi sold such T-shirts during public tapings of his television show. Sondhi hosted an own outdoor talk show throughout late 2005 and early 2006 at Thammasat University and in Lumphini Park with his slogan, \\"We Fight for the King\\". His broadcasts/protests, which later became the core of the People's Alliance for Democracy attracted many protesters, with the largest one on February 4, 2006 at the Royal Plaza drawing between 40,000 - 50,000 (foreign media estimates) and 100,000 (local media estimates) protestors.Channelnewsasia.com The talk show protests were broadcast online via the ManagerOnline web site, generating nearly a twofold increase in site visitors, from an average of 80,000 to 150,000 visitors per day. Protests led by Sondhi took on an increasingly critical tone. At a protest in late February 2006, social activist and Buddhist lay leader Sulak Sivaraksa called Thaksin \\"a pitiful dog\\", while Auychai Watha, chairman of a north-eastern teachers' group, called for Thaksin's children to \\"become whores infected with venereal disease.\\" The conduct of the protesters was condemned by the chairman of Amnesty International Thailand. Protesters often harassed journalists and news crews.The Nation, Non-violence is not simply the absence of physical violence , 1 March 2006 Sondhi was harshly criticized for attempting to use the King for his own benefit.The Nation, \\"Policeman sues media tycoon for lese majeste\\", 9 November 2005 The Nation, \\"Sondhi gets 'warning' letter from guardsmen\\", 17 November 2005 Nevertheless, Sondhi's income skyrocketed as a result of his political activism as the demonstration gained wider support from public. Revenues of his media companies increased by no less than 215 million baht (approx $6 million US) a month from the start of his protests to early 2006.‡πÇ‡∏û‡∏™‡∏ó‡∏π‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏¢‡πå, \\"‡πÅ‡∏â‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏á‡∏™‡πå‡∏°‡πá‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏π‡πâ‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥ \\"‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏¥\\" ‡∏ü‡∏≤‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏•‡∏∞ 215 ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô\\", 23 March 2006 === The Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident === In the early hours of 21 March 2006, 27-year-old Thanakorn Pakdeepol entered the popular Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine in central Bangkok and attacked the figure of Brahma with a hammer. After he destroyed the statue, he was immediately attacked and beaten to death by several people who witnesses it. Thanakorn had a history of mental illness and depression.Man beaten to death after desecrating the Erawan Shrine On his talk show the following day, Sondhi claimed that Thaksin Shinawatra had masterminded the destruction in order to replace the image of Brahma with a \\"dark force\\" aligned to Thaksin.Dreaded day dawns ‚Äì despite lies and dark forces Sondhi claimed Thaksin had hired Thanakorn through Khmer (Cambodian) black-magic shamans.Vandal's dad distraught However, the vandal's father, Sayant Pakdeepol, denied the accusation and called Sondhi \\"the biggest liar I have ever seen\\". Thaksin called Sondhi's accusations \\"insane\\". ===The Finland Plot=== Starting in May 2006, Sondhi's Manager Daily newspaper published a series of articles on a movement called, \\"Finland Plot\\", claiming that Thaksin Shinawatra and former radical student leaders from the 1970s met in Finland in 1999 to create a plan to overthrow the Thai constitutional monarchy and establish a republic. No evidence was ever produced to support the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai Party firmly denied the accusations. Thaksin sued Sondhi and several Manager Daily executives for defamation. Sondhi countered by saying that Thaksin was trying to silence the press.The Nation, \\"Thaksin clearly wanted republic, critics charge\\", 25 May 2006The Bangkok Post, \\"Manager sued for articles on 'Finland plot'\\" , 31 May 2006 == Post-2006 Coup == Sondhi and other leaders of People's Alliance for Democracy scheduled a massive demonstration against Thaksin on 20 September 2006. In the days preceding the demonstration, rumours spread that the protest would turn bloody. However, on 19 September 2006, the Thai military, led by General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, overthrew the Thaksin government, dissolved the Parliament, and abrogated the constitution. Thaksin, abroad at the time, was exiled indefinitely, and several members of his Cabinet were summoned for investigation. Sondhi's protest was cancelled, and the PAD later disbanded itself, claiming it was no longer needed. Sondhi supported the coup, and later went on an international tour through London, Washington DC, and New York to celebrate with the PAD's expatriate supporters. Speech by Sondi and Kraisak Chunhawan given at School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (in RealMedia format) During his trip, he also raised funds for the IPO of his satellite business, and explained that he had spent almost 420 million baht of his own money on the PAD campaign. He later announced that his political focus would be on educating the Thai public on how badly the Thaksin government had run the country. To accomplish this, Sondhi established the Thailand Watch Foundation (Yam Fau Paendin Foundation), a non-profit organization that provides financial support to part of his post-Thaksin efforts. He announced that he would end all of his public roles within five years. Sondhi took a critical stance against the junta when it appointed a few cabinet members who had previously served as civil servants under the Thaksin government. He later apologized in court to Chaisit Shinawatra, cousin of Thaksin, for claiming that the Shinawatra and Damapong families had \\"plundered\\" the nation, and that all of them were \\"lower than ****\\". Chaisit dropped litigation against Sondhi in return for the apology. The court has stated that by accusing a whole family, Sondhi could not be charged, which was an example of Thailand's bizarre legal system.The Nation, Media tycoon Sonthi apologises to Chaisit , 15 January 2007 As a reward for his support, Sondhi was invited by the Council for National Security (the military junta that overthrew Thaksin's government) to air a political commentary show on government-run Channel 11.The Nation, Govt must tolerate dissent , 21 February 2007 However, after critics and pressure, Sondhi cancelled his airing program.

The Office of His Majesty's Principal Private Secretary said in a public statement that Arsa had \\"has no connections whatsoever\\" with the issue, and that Sondhi made \\"incorrect allegations\\" against the royal secretary. \\"Sondhi's statement indicated that he failed to double-check the facts and had intended to frame and cause damage to Arsa Sarasin and the Office of His Majesty's Principal Private Secretary,\\" said a letter sent to Sondhi.The Nation, HM's office rebuts Arsa allegations , 4 March 2007 Sondhi issued an apology a few days later, but also publicly warned Arsa that he had no right to use the office of the King's Principal Private Secretary to defend himself in a personal matter.

He joined the Armed Forces as a storekeeper in 1940. When the World War II broke out, he opted for service on the front, and served in Iraq and Iran till year April 1944. After he returned, he was posted at Khadki and married Sindhu. They had two daughters, Vidyullata and Asilata. ==Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi== Godse's brother, Nathuram, shot Mahatma Gandhi on 30 January 1948. Gopal helped to plot the assassination and was reportedly present, although he froze and was unable to fire his own gun. Gopal was arrested on 5 February from his house in Pune and was sentenced to 18 years for his part in the assassination. Nathuram was executed by hanging alongside another co-conspirator, Narayan Apte, on 15 November 1949. The three men believed that Gandhi had turned his back on the Indian independence movement, and that his actions led to the Partition of India which in turn led to the inflammation of sectarian strife between Pakistan's Muslims and India's Hindus. In an interview with Rediff.com in 1998, Gopal reiterated that he never regretted Gandhi's killing. He hated what he called Gandhi's \\"appeasement\\" of Muslims. According to Godse, what triggered the assassination was a bomb explosion on 20 January 1948 at Gandhi's prayer meeting in Delhi, just 50 meters away from Gandhi. The failed explosion, for which Madan Lal Pahwa was caught, heightened the urgency - the Godse brothers wanted to finish it before the police caught them. Godse claimed that Gandhi never really said \\"Hey Ram\\" as he was dying and this was just a ploy of the government to prove that he was, indeed, a staunch Hindu who deserved to be elevated to sainthood. In an interview with Time, he said, \\"Someone asked me whether Gandhi said \\"Hey Ram\\". I said Kingsley did say it. But Gandhi did not. Because that was not a drama.\\" He admitted that at one point, Gandhi was his idol. He credited Gandhi for the mass awakening that he created and that he removed the fear of prison from the minds of Indians. A group photo of people accused in the Mahatma Gandhi's murder case.

Savarkar, Nathuram Godse, Vishnu Karkare == Life after the assassination of Gandhi == After Gopal was arrested in 1948 for his role in the assassination of Gandhi, Sindhu-tai Godse supported their daughters by working in Gopal's elder brother Dattatraya's workshop, called 'Udyam Engineering'. Later she set up a separate home in Pune and also started a small workshop of her own named 'Pratap Engineering'. Godse was released from prison in October 1964, but was re-arrested a month later under the Defense of India Act and kept in prison for over a year. He was finally released at the end of 1965. Afterwards, he lived largely on the royalties obtained from books he wrote on Mahatma Gandhi and the assassination. He wrote nine books in Marathi and English. Gopal and Sindhutai Godse lived in an apartment in Sadashiv Peth, Pune. He died there on 26 November 2005. Sindhutai Godse died in 2007. At the time of Godse's death in 2005, his daughter Himani Savarkar (n√©e Asilata Godse) led a Hindu outfit from Pune. Godse and Savarkar's family continued to be close. Godse's daughter Asilata subsequently married Ashok Savarkar, the son of Savarkar‚Äôs younger brother Narayan. The families continue to be close to the Hindu Mahasabha, and Gopal Godse remained its general secretary for many years after his release from prison. ==Bibliography== * Has a life convict to die in prison under Indian law?

According to the Jami' al-Tawarikh, his given name was Jo'chi and he got the nickname Khasar after his distinguished bravery. He was also called Habutu Hasar (–•–∞–≤—Ç –•–∞—Å–∞—Ä, Hasar the Skillful (archer)) because he was skilled with a bow. ==Early life== Hasar, as a child, was thrown out of the Borjigin tribe along with the rest of the family by the Taichud warlord Targhutai Hiriltug. Food was scarce and Behter, his older half-brother, and the eldest of all the sons of the late Yesugei, stole or kept food from his mother and siblings. Hasar and his brother Tem√ºjin killed their half-brother Behter as he returned from a fresh hunt. After the defeat of Tem√ºjin at Khalakhaljid Sands (1203), Hasar was lost and hid himself, along with his sons and followers, in the forest. Tem√ºjin then gathered new adherents among the Mongols, tricked his rival Ong Khan with a fake message of surrender from his missing brother Hasar, and crushed the Keraites in late 1203. ==Military career== Granted territories by the khan, Genghis Khan's full brothers Qasar, Khajiun, and Temuge formed the Left Wing of the Mongol Empire in the eastern edge of Inner Mongolia, while Genghis Khan's three sons, Jochi, Chaghatai, and √ñgedei, made up the Right Wing in the western edge. The Right Wing saw a significant expansion to the west but the Left Wing did not have so much land to be conquered. Qasar did conquer what would later be known as Manchuria, Korea and territories that are presently controlled by Russia (north of Korea). Hasar's mother, Hoelun defended him against accusations of disloyalty stemming from Teb Tengri, a shaman. Stiffened by his mother Hoelun and wife B√∂rte, who saw Teb Tengri as threat to the dynastic succession, Genghis allowed Khasar and Tem√ºge to kill Teb Tengri in a wrestling match. Unlike the Right Wing where properties were equally divided, Tem√ºge was favored over Khasar and Khachiun in the Left Wing. Hasar's ulus (people and secondarily, territory) was significantly smaller than Tem√ºge's. His original territory was located to the west of the Khingan Mountains and was surrounded by the Ergune and Hailar rivers, and the K√ºl√ºn Mountain. After the conquest of China, Hasarid princes had at least two additional territories in Shandong and Jiangxi, respectively. == Ancestry == ==Descendants== The princely houses of Hasar, Hachiun, and Tem√ºge tended to coordinate with the five powerful clans: the Jalayir, Khunggirad, Ikires, Uruud, and Mangghud. They were usually led by princes from Tem√ºge's house. At Arigh Bukha's rebellion, the three princely houses supported Khubilai (Genghis Khan's grandson) under leadership of Tem√ºge's grandson, Ta'achar. Among Hasarid princes, the third family head Yes√ºngge is probably the most famous. He was a son of Hasar and succeeded his brother Yeg√º. He is the hero of the Yes√ºngge Inscription (formerly known as the Genghis Stone). The princely house was succeeded by Yes√ºngge's son, Esen Em√ºgen, and then Em√ºgen's son, Shigd√ºr. Although Shigd√ºr joined the rebellion against Khubilai led by Tem√ºge's great- great-grandson Nayan, the princely house survived without confusion. The sixth head, Babusha, was given the title of Qi Wang by Khayishan K√ºl√ºg Khan in 1307. Sources show that Qasarid princes continued to hold the title even after the empire retreated from China. Hasar's descendants were effective in other parts of Mongol Empire. It is also claimed that one Qasarid prince was killed in order to protect the last Great Khan Toghogan-Temur from Ming troops. Togha Tem√ºr, a descendant of Hasar, was the last powerful claimant to the throne of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century. The family was known as the Hasar(Qasar) clan. With the death of Togha_Tem√ºr at the hands of the Sarbadars of northern Khurasan in the mid-1300s, it is possible that the surviving members of the Hasar(Qasar) clan escaped into the mountains of what is today Afghanistan, where their descendants maintained their clan name of Hasar, which evolved over time into Hasara or Hazaras. As the Hazara people do not have a written history of their own, nothing can be proven, but this theory is more likely versus the theory that the name Hazara comes from the Persian word for \\"one thousand,\\" which is actually, \\"hezar( ).\\" As these Il Khanate Mongols had converted to Shia Islam and married Farsi speaking Persian women, their children had been raised as Shia Muslims with a mixed Mongol-Persian characteristic. This explains the current culture of Hazaras people very well. It is not clear what happened to Hasarid princes from the late Yuan Dynasty to the middle 15th century because of the confusion caused by the Mongols' withdrawal from China. Mongolian chronicles compiled from the 17th century to the early 18th century contain some records on Hasar's descendants but they are considered mostly unhistorical by historians. In particular, Altan Tobchi by Mergen Gegeen (not to be confused with Lubsandanjin's Altan Tobchi) exaggerated the influence of Hasarid princes as the author himself descended from Khasar. The Oirat ruler Esen Tayisi deported a body of the Horchin to Western Mongolia in 1446 and they became the Khoshuds.C.P.Atwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.310 It is widely accepted that Hasar's descendant Bolunai was a historical figure since his existence is confirmed in contemporary Chinese sources of 1463, 1467, and 1470. Mongolian chronicles say that Bolunai's brother Unubold killed Muulihai of the Ongliud, a descendant of Genghis Khan's half brother Belg√ºtei. Another famous story about Unubold tells that he proposed to Mandukhai Khatun, a widow of Manduulun Khan, but that she chose the Genghisid infant Batu M√∂ngke (Dayan Khan) over him. Bolunai led the Horchin Mongols. His descendants ruled the Horchin, Jalayid, Do'rbed, and Gorlos of the Jirim League, the Aru Khorchin of the Juu Uda League, and the D√∂rben He√ºhed, Muu Mingghan, and Urad of the Ulaanchab League in the Manchu Qing Dynasty's administration. Among them, Horchin princes established matrimonial relationship with the imperial family of Aisin Gioro at the early stage of the Manchu rise to power, and held top-ranking princely titles (ho≈°oi cin wang) throughout the Qing Dynasty. The Dorbeds in Heilongjiang province submitted to the Qing in 1624, and they were organized into a banner in Jirim league ruled by descendants of Hasar. The Gorlos banners were also ruled by descendants of Hasar. == See also == *Mughal (tribe) == References == *Sugiyama Masaaki ÊùâÂ±±Ê≠£Êòé: Mongoru teikoku no genz≈ç „É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´Â∏ùÂõΩ„ÅÆÂéüÂÉè, Mongoru teikoku to Daigen urusu „É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´Â∏ùÂõΩ„Å®Â§ßÂÖÉ„Ç¶„É´„Çπ (The Mongol Empire and Dai-√∂n Ulus), pp. 28‚Äì61, 2004. *Sugiyama Masaaki ÊùâÂ±±Ê≠£Êòé: Babusha no reiji yori ÂÖ´‰∏çÊ≤ô„ÅÆ‰ª§Êó®„Çà„Çä, Mongoru teikoku to Daigen urusu „É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´Â∏ùÂõΩ„Å®Â§ßÂÖÉ„Ç¶„É´„Çπ (The Mongol Empire and Dai-√∂n Ulus), pp. 187‚Äì240, 2004. *Okada, Hidehiro Â≤°Áî∞Ëã±Âºò: The Descendants of J√∂chi Khasar in Altan Tobchi of Mergen Gegen Â¢®ÁàæÊ†πÊ†ºÊ†πÊâÄÊí∞„ÄéÈªÑÈáëÂè≤Á∂±„Äè‰∏≠‰πãÊãôËµ§ÂêàÊííÂÖí‰∏ñÁ≥ª, Ya-chou tsu-p'u hs√ºeh-shu yen-t'ao-hui hui-i chi-lu ‰∫ûÊ¥≤ÊóèË≠úÂ≠∏Ë°ìÁ†îË®éÊúÉÊúÉË≠∞Ë®òÈåÑ, No.6, pp. 45‚Äì57, 1993. *–ß—É–ª—É—É–Ω—ã –î–∞–ª–∞–π - –ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª—ã–Ω —Ç“Ø“Ø—Ö 1260 - 1388. –•—É—É–¥–∞—Å 142.

It grew out of the Rationalist Association of New South Wales and the Victorian Socialist Party, and was led by former Rhodes scholar Percy Stephensen.

Between 1936 and 1942, Miles published 16 volumes of a newsletter titled The Publicist, to which he contributed.Muirden, p.106 He was a leading member of the Rationalist Association, and used The Publicist as his mouthpiece.

The Australia First Movement has been characterised as anti-Semitic, anti-war and pro-isolationist, and advocated Australia's independence from the British Empire. It attracted the support of the Catholic weekly, The Advocate, as well as the Odinist Alexander Rud Mills.

A number of members came from a far-left background: Stephensen, Pankhurst and Walsh were former Communists. In March 1942, four members of the Australia First Movement in Perth, and sixteen in Sydney, were arrested, based on the suspicion that they would provide help to Japanese invaders. Two were convicted of conspiring to assist the enemy, and others were interned for the duration of the war.

He was an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. == Early life == He was Aromanian in origin, his family having settled with Naum »òaguna (Andrei's father) in Hungary from Grabova, now Albania. With the guidance of local Jesuits, »òaguna's parents had opted to convert to Roman Catholicism, seeking to obtain a better status than the second-class one reserved for most Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Habsburgs. However, the »òagunas most likely continued to practice their original religion in secret - the future Metropolitan was probably never a practising Catholic. After he rejoined the Orthodox Church while living and studying in Pest, Andrei »òaguna became a monk and started his ecclesiastical career in the Banat region. As he was becoming a convinced nationalist, »òaguna refused to join the Serbian Orthodox Church hierarchy in Sremski Karlovci (at the time, the Orthodox Christians in Banat were under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Church). Instead, he left for Transylvania - where he was able to integrate within a Romanian-dominated clergy. == In the Revolution == »òaguna got involved in the movement that sought increased rights for Romanians and demanded that Transylvania would become an autonomous entity of the Monarchy after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 (as opposed to the Hungarian plans for a Union of the two). As such, »òaguna was present at the Blaj Assembly in May, where he argued for a moderate position. The respect he enjoyed, as well as his will for mediation got him elected to the executive of the Romanian movement, and soon after he was to be the main delegate petitioning Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and the Vienna government. 200px As the Hungarians effectively imposed the union project at the end of the same month, Andrei »òaguna joined the side that still sought a compromise. The Romanian envoys led by him negotiated with the Hungarian side until September, when the conflict between Hungary and the Habsburgs erupted, coupled with an understanding between the Romanians and Vienna (the former were allowed to create a loyalist administration in Transylvania). In October, as Transylvania became a battleground, ≈ûaguna and the rest of the Romanian leadership took refuge in Sibiu (where the Austrian army still held some ground). Austrian General Anton Freiherr von Puchner, who had taken refuge to the Wallachian region of Oltenia, pressured »òaguna and other leaders to openly demand that Imperial Russian occupiers of Wallachia protect his last contingents as they evacuated Transylvania. His commanders were hoping to turn the tide by attacking Hungary from the west, and a Russian presence was not requested officially. However, as the troops in Transylvania were on the brink of destruction (and the rest of Puchner's army was being decimated by a cholera epidemic), a Romanian request was judged honorable. Prolonged negotiations led to a compromise, through which the Romanians agreed to appeal to the Russians through an unsigned petition issued by \\"Sibiu citizens\\". The Russians did respond, and helped Austrians into Wallachia - the refugees were to be followed by all the Romanian leaders. The Hungarians leadership reacted with anger at the outcome (since it prolonged the war and created a precedent). Information got out about ≈ûaguna's involvement, which leader Lajos Kossuth feared to be a confirmation that the Eastern Orthodox Romanians had accommodated Pan-Slavism. In offers of peace he sent to Romanian insurgent Avram Iancu, Kossuth singled out ≈ûaguna as an enemy, specifying that no offer of amnesty would include the cleric. In February 1849, as the tide of a second and decisive Russian military action grew near, Andrei ≈ûaguna left for Austria, where he drew suspicion by trying to reanimate a previous project, which asked for a common Romanians-in-Austria realm (Transylvania together with the Banat and Bukovina). Such demands proved decisive after the crushing of Kossuth's movement: Austria steadily withdrew its offers to Romanians, as it feared that encouragement of their cause would lead to a Hungarian-like crisis. == Later activities == Andrei »òaguna - statue in front of the ASTRA Palace in Sibiu In 1850, »òaguna was again leader of a delegation to Vienna, asking Franz Joseph I of Austria for an institution of higher learning to be approved by the Austrian leadership, and further liberties and education rights for the Romanian community. As the Austrians were highly skeptical of Romanian goals, most of these remained unanswered, and further Romanian attempts were made useless after the 1867 Ausgleich cut off communication with Austria. Although »òaguna's activities had assured the recognition of a Romanian Transylvanian Orthodox Church, the new administration meant the absorption of Transylvania into the Hungarian and centralized half of Austria- Hungary (with the disappearance of the Transylvanian Diet). »òaguna and other mainstream Romanian leaders found themselves forced to limit their activities to the cultural field. The cleric was the main activist of the 1861-founded ASTRA cultural society, and remained focused on its activities up until his death.

According to tradition an old man, living in a Chippewa village at the Fond du Lac (end of the lake), had four adult sons. They frequently made trips to visit the Sioux and they often returned home with gifts. During one particular trip one of the sons was killed in a quarrel over a Sioux woman. The remaining three brothers returned home for a short while, then returned to the Sioux, convinced the death of their brother was a mistake. However, upon this trip, only one brother returned home to his father safely. The last son, filled with forgiveness, went to seek the Sioux and reconcile their differences, but only met his death in the Sioux village.Warren (1985), pp. 158-160. For two years after, the father hunted and worked hard to obtain enough ammunition and supplies to raid the Sioux village and seek his revenge. As was the custom, he sent his tobacco and war club to the other Chippewa villages asking for help to accompany him \\"in search of his sons\\".

Periodic timers signal every time they reach a specific value and then restart, thus producing a signal at periodic intervals. Periodic timers are typically used to invoke activities that must be performed at regular intervals. Counters are usually programmed with fixed intervals that determine how long the counter will count before it signals. The interval determines how long the counter will count before it will output a signal. ==IBM PC compatible== The Intel 8253 PIT was the original timing device used on IBM PC compatibles.

Princeton WordNet is a scientific instrument used to measure the angle of rotation caused by passing polarized light through an optically active substance.Polarimeter. kenyon.edu Some chemical substances are optically active, and polarized (uni- directional) light will rotate either to the left (counter-clockwise) or right (clockwise) when passed through these substances. The amount by which the light is rotated is known as the angle of rotation. The angle of rotation is basically known as observed angle. ==History== Polarization by reflection was discovered in 1808 by √âtienne-Louis Malus (1775‚Äì1812). (See also Optical rotation#History). A nicol prism or a polaroid filter can be used to polarize the light. ==Measuring Principle== The ratio, the purity, and the concentration of two enantiomers can be measured via polarimetry. Enantiomers are characterized by their property to rotate the plane of linear polarized light. Therefore, those compounds are called optically active and their property is referred to as optical rotation. Light sources such as a light bulb, a light-emitting diode (LED), or the sun emit electromagnetic waves at the frequency of visible light. Their electric field oscillates in all possible planes relative to their direction of propagation. In contrast to that, the waves of linear-polarized light oscillate in parallel planes.Hart, C. (2002), Organische Chemie, Wiley-VCH, If light encounters a polarizer, only the part of the light that oscillates in the defined plane of the polarizer may pass through. That plane is called the plane of polarization. The plane of polarization is turned by optically active compounds. According to the direction in which the light is rotated, the enantiomer is referred to as dextro-rotatory or levo-rotatory. The optical activity of enantiomers is additive. If different enantiomers exist together in one solution, their optical activity adds up. That is why racemates are optically inactive, as they nullify their clockwise and counter clockwise optical activities. The optical rotation is proportional to the concentration of the optically active substances in solution. Polarimeters may therefore be applied for concentration measurements of enantiomer-pure samples. With a known concentration of a sample, polarimeters may also be applied to determine the specific rotation when characterizing a new substance. The specific rotation [\\\\alpha]_\\\\lambda^T is a physical property and defined as the optical rotation Œ± at a path length l of 1 dm, a concentration c of 1g/100 mL, a temperature T (usually 20 ¬∞C) and a light wavelength Œª (usually sodium D line at 589.3 nm): : :[\\\\alpha]_\\\\lambda^T = \\\\frac{ 100 \\\\times \\\\alpha}{l \\\\times c} This tells us how much the plane of polarization is rotated when the ray of light passes through a specific amount of optically active molecules of a sample. Therefore, the optical rotation depends on temperature, concentration, wavelength, path length, and the substance being analyzed. ==Construction== The polarimeter is made up of two Nicol prisms (the polarizer and analyzer). The polarizer is fixed and the analyzer can be rotated. The prisms may be thought of as slits S1 and S2. The light waves may be considered to correspond to waves in the string. The polarizer S1 allows only those light waves which move in a single plane. This causes the light to become plane polarized. When the analyzer is also placed in a similar position it allows the light waves coming from the polarizer to pass through it. When it is rotated through the right angle no waves can pass through the right angle and the field appears to be dark. If now a glass tube containing an optically active solution is placed between the polarizer and analyzer the light now rotates through the plane of polarization through a certain angle, the analyzer will have to be rotated in same angle. ==Operation== Polarimeters measure this by passing monochromatic light through the first of two polarising plates, creating a polarized beam. This first plate is known as the polarizer.Polarimetry . chem.vt.edu This beam is then rotated as it passes through the sample. After passing through the sample, a second polarizer, known as the analyzer, rotates either via manual rotation or automatic detection of the angle. When the analyzer is rotated such that all the light or no light can pass through, then one can find the angle of rotation which is equal to the angle by which the analyser was rotated(Œ∏) in the former case or (90-Œ∏) in the latter case. ==Types of polarimeter== ===Laurent's half-shade polarimeter=== When plane-polarised light passes through some crystals, the velocity of left-polarised light is different from that of the right-polarised light thus the crystals are said to have two refractive indices i.e. double refracting Construction: It consists of a monochromatic source S which is placed at focal point of a convex lens L. Just after the convex lens there is a Nicol Prism P which acts as a polariser. H is a half shade device which divides the field of polarised light emerging out of the Nicol P into two halves generally of unequal brightness. T is a glass tube in which optically active solution is filled. The light after passing through T is allowed to fall on the analyzing Nicol A which can be rotated about the axis of the tube. The rotation of analyser can be measured with the help of a scale C. Working: In order to understand the need of a half-shade device, let us suppose that half-shade device is not present. The position of the analyzer is so adjusted that the field of view is dark when tube is empty. The position of the analyzer is noted on circular scale. Now the tube is filled with optically active solution and it is set in its proper position. The optically active solution rotates the plane of polarization of the light emerging out of the polariser P by some angle. So the light is transmitted by analyzer A and the field of view of telescope becomes bright. Now the analyzer is rotated by a finite angle so that the field of view of telescope again become dark. This will happen only when the analyzer is rotated by the same angle by which plane of polarization of light is rotated by optically active solution. The position of analyzer is again noted. The difference of the two readings will give you angle of rotation of plane of polarization (8). A difficulty is faced in the above procedure that when analyzer is rotated for the total darkness, then it is attained gradually and hence it is difficult to find the exact position correctly for which complete darkness is obtained. To overcome above difficulty half-shade device is introduced between polariser P and glass tube T. thumb Half Shade Device It consist of two semicircular plates ACB and ADB. One half ACB is made of glass while other half is made of quartz. Both the halves are cemented together. The quartz is cut parallel to the optic axis. Thickness of the quartz is selected in such a way that it introduces a path difference of ‚ÄôA/2 between ordinary and extraordinary ray. The thickness of the glass is selected in such a way that it absorbs the same amount of light as is absorbed by quartz half. Consider that the vibration of polarisation is along OP. On passing through the glass half the vibrations remain along OP. But on passing through quartz half these vibrations will split into 0- and ¬£-components. The ¬£-components are parallel to the optic axis while O- component is perpendicular to optic axis. The O-component travels faster in quartz and hence an emergence 0-component will be along OD instead of along OC. Thus components OA and OD will combine to form a resultant vibration along OQ which makes same angle with optic axis as OP. Now if the Principal plane of the analyzing Nicol is parallel to OP then the light will pass through glass half unobstructed. Hence glass half will be brighter than quartz half or we can say that glass half will be bright and the quartz half will be dark. Similarly if principal plane of analyzing Nicol is parallel to OQ then quartz half will be bright and glass half will be dark. When the principal plane of analyzer is along AOB then both halves will be equally bright. On the other hand, if the principal plane of analyzer is along DOC. then both the halves will be equally dark. Thus it is clear that if the analyzing Nicol is slightly disturbed from DOC then one half becomes brighter than the other. Hence by using half shade device, one can measure angle of rotation more accurately. Determination of Specific Rotation In order to determine specific rotation of an optically active substance (say sugar) the polarimeter tube T is first filled with pure water and analyzer is adjusted for equal darkness (Both the halves should be equally dark) point. The position of the analyzer is noted with the help of scale. Now the polarimeter tube is filled with sugar solution of known concentration and again the analyser is adjusted in such a way that again equally dark point is achieved. The position of the analyzer is again noted. The difference of the two readings will give you angle of rotation Œ∏. Hence specific rotation S is determined by using the relation. [S]t Œª =Œ∏ /LC The above procedure may be repeated for different concentration. ===Biquartz polarimeter=== In biquartz polarimeters, a biquartz plate is used. Biquartz plate consists of two semi circular plates of quartz each of thickness 3.75mm. One half consists of right-handed optically active quartz, while the other is left-handed optically active quartz. ===Lippich polarimeter=== === X-Ray Polarimeter === ===Quartz- Wedge polarimeter=== ===Manual=== The earliest polarimeters, which date back to the 1830s, required the user to physically rotate one polarizing element (the analyzer) whilst viewing through another static element (the detector). The detector was positioned at the opposite end of a tube containing the optically active sample, and the user used his/her eye to judge the \\"alignment\\" when least light was observed. The angle of rotation was then read from a simple fixed to the moving polariser to within a degree or so. Although most manual polarimeters produced today still adopt this basic principle, the many developments applied to the original opto-mechanical design over the years have significantly improved measurement performance. The introduction of a half-wave plate increased \\"distinction sensitivity\\", whilst a precision glass scale with vernier drum facilitated the final reading to within ca. ¬±0.05¬∫. Most modern manual polarimeters also incorporate a long-life yellow LED in place of the more costly sodium arc lamp as a light source. ===Semi- automatic=== Today, semi-automatic polarimeters are available. The operator views the image via a digital display adjusts the analyzer angle with electronic controls. ===Fully automatic=== Fully automatic polarimeters are now available and simply require the user to press a button and wait for a digital readout. Fast automatic digital polarimeters yield an accurate result within a second, regardless of the rotation angle of the sample. In addition, they provide continuous measurement, facilitating High-performance liquid chromatography and other kinetic investigations. Another feature of modern polarimeters is the Faraday modulator. The Faraday modulator creates an alternating current magnetic field. It oscillates the plane of polarization to enhance the detection accuracy by allowing the point of maximal darkness to be passed through again and again and thus be determined with even more accuracy. As the temperature of the sample has a significant influence on the optical rotation of the sample, modern polarimeters have already included Peltier Elements to actively control the temperature. Special techniques like a temperature controlled sample tube reduce measuring errors and ease operation. Results can directly be transferred to computers or networks for automatic processing. Traditionally, accurate filling of the sample cell had to be checked outside the instrument, as an appropriate control from within the device was not possible. Nowadays a camera system allows accurate monitoring of the sample and filling conditions in the sample cell from inside the instrument. A telecentric camera gives a sharp image over the complete length of any sample cell placed within modern instruments. The online monitoring of the filling process ensures that no bubbles or particles obstruct the measurement. A picture can be saved together with the recorded data. Any temperature gradients, inhomogeneous sample distributions or air bubbles can immediately be recognized before measurement, so that potential errors caused by bubbles or particles are no longer an issue. ==Sources of error== The angle of rotation of an optically active substance can be affected by: * Concentration of the sample * Wavelength of light passing through the sample (generally, angle of rotation and wavelength tend to be inversely proportional) * Temperature of the sample (generally the two are directly proportional) * Length of the sample cell (input by the user into most automatic polarimeters to ensure better accuracy) * Filling conditions (bubbles, temperature and concentration gradients) Most modern polarimeters have methods for compensating or/and controlling these errors. ==Calibration== Traditionally, a sucrose solution with a defined concentration was used to calibrate polarimeters relating the amount of sugar molecules to the light polarization rotation. The International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA) played a key role in unifying analytical methods for the sugar industry, set standards for the International Sugar Scale (ISS) and the specifications for polarimeters in sugar industry ICUMSA Specification and Standard SPS-1(1998). However, sugar solutions are prone to contamination and evaporation. Moreover, the optical rotation of a substance is very sensitive to temperature. A more reliable and stable standard was found: crystalline quartz which is oriented and cut in a way that it matches the optical rotation of a normal sugar solution, but without showing the disadvantages mentioned above http://www.inmetro.gov.br/inovacao/artigos/docs/128.pdf M.

Nowadays, quartz plates or quartz control plates of different thickness serve as standards to calibrate polarimeters and saccharimeters. In order to ensure reliable and comparable results, quartz plates can be calibrated and certified by metrology institutes. However, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Germany is the only authorized governmental institution to perform initial certification of quartz plates with appropriate equipment. The calibration is performed in accordance with the recommendations of ICUMSA or OIML (Organisation Internationale de M√©trologie L√©gale) OIML, ‚ÄúPolarimetric saccharimeters graduated in accordance with the ICUMSA, International Sugar Scale‚Äù, OIML R 14 (1995). A calibration first consists of a preliminary test in which the fundamental calibration capability is checked. The quartz control plates must meet the required minimum requirements with respect to their dimensions, optical pureness, flatness, parallelism of the faces and optical axis errors. After that, the actual measurement value - the optical rotation - is measured with the precision polarimeter. The measurement uncertainty of the polarimeter amounts to 0.001¬∞ (k=2) https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-42/ag-421/polarimetric- calibration-of-quartz-control-plates.html. ==Applications== Because many optically active chemicals such as tartaric acid, are stereoisomers, a polarimeter can be used to identify which isomer is present in a sample ‚Äì if it rotates polarized light to the left, it is a levo-isomer, and to the right, a dextro-isomer. It can also be used to measure the ratio of enantiomers in solutions. The optical rotation is proportional to the concentration of the optically active substances in solution. Polarimetry may therefore be applied for concentration measurements of enantiomer-pure samples. With a known concentration of a sample, polarimetry may also be applied to determine the specific rotation (a physical property) when characterizing a new substance. ===Chemical industry=== Many chemicals exhibit a specific rotation as a unique property (an intensive property like refractive index or Specific gravity) which can be used to distinguish it. Polarimeters can identify unknown samples based on this if other variables such as concentration and length of sample cell length are controlled or at least known. This is used in the chemical industry. By the same token, if the specific rotation of a sample is already known, then the concentration and/or purity of a solution containing it can be calculated. Most automatic polarimeters make this calculation automatically, given input on variables from the user. ===Food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries=== Concentration and purity measurements are especially important to determine product or ingredient quality in the food & beverage and pharmaceutical industries. Samples that display specific rotations that can be calculated for purity with a polarimeter include: * Steroids * Diuretics * Antibiotics * Narcotics * Vitamins * Analgesics * Amino acids * Essential oils * Polymers * Starches * Sugars Polarimeters are used in the sugar industry for determining quality of both juice from sugar cane and the refined sucrose. Often, the sugar refineries use a modified polarimeter with a flow cell (and used in conjunction with a refractometer) called a saccharimeter. These instruments use the International Sugar Scale, as defined by the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA). ==See also== * Optical rotation * Polarimetry * Polarization * Chirality * Enantiomers ==References== Category:Polarization (waves) Category:Optical devices Category:French inventions ","title":"Polarimeter"},{"id":"3259031","text":"Centraal Beheer logo The office of Centraal Beheer in Apeldoorn Centraal Beheer is an insurance company located in Apeldoorn, Netherlands.

He was allegedly a descendant of Ju Song (), who served as a historian under the mythical Yellow Emperor. Known for being ambitious since he was a child, he was particularly interested in strategy. He started his career as an Attendant Officer () under Han Fu, the Governor of Ji Province, probably sometime in the reign of Emperor Ling ( 168‚Äì189). During this time, he was nominated as a maocai (ËåÇÊâç; outstanding civil service candidate) and held office as the Prefect () of two counties in Ji Province. Han Fu later recommended him to be a Cavalry Commandant (). In 191, Ju Shou came to serve the warlord Yuan Shao after Han Fu relinquished his governorship of Ji Province to Yuan Shao. He proposed to Yuan Shao a grand plan: conquer Ji, Qing, You and Bing provinces in northern China, recruit all the talents in these four provinces, and bring the figurehead Emperor Xian ( 189‚Äì220) to Ji Province. Yuan Shao was so pleased that he appointed Ju Shou as an Army Supervisor () and General of Vehement Might (). In 195, when Emperor Xian was in Luoyang, Ju Shou advised Yuan Shao to welcome the emperor to Ye city, the capital of Ji Province, and use him as a \\"trump card\\" against rival warlords. Just when Yuan Shao was about to follow Ju Shou's advice, some of his other advisers (e.g. Guo Tu) argued that the emperor would be a \\"burden\\" rather than a \\"trump card\\" because they would have to directly take orders from him and have less autonomy. Yuan Shao thus decided not to bring Emperor Xian to Ji Province. In the following year, Yuan Shao's rival Cao Cao brought Emperor Xian to his base in Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and established the new imperial capital there. In the late 190s, Yuan Shao wanted to divide his territories among his three sons by putting each son in charge of one province and assess their capabilities. However, Ju Shou strongly objected to this idea and argued that it would sow the seeds for internal conflict later. Yuan Shao ignored him and went ahead by putting his eldest son Yuan Tan in charge of Qing Province, his second son Yuan Xi in charge of You Province, his maternal nephew Gao Gan in charge of Bing Province, while his third son Yuan Shang would succeed him as the Governor of Ji Province. Ju Shou's prediction came true as conflict broke out between Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang almost immediately after Yuan Shao's death in 202. In 199, after Yuan Shao eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan and gained complete control over the four provinces in northern China, he planned to attack Cao Cao in the south. Ju Shou and Tian Feng, another of Yuan Shao's advisers, urged him to adopt a slow, steady and step-by-step approach towards attacking Cao Cao because it was to their advantage. However, Yuan Shao did not heed Ju Shou and Tian Feng's advice and prepared for an all-out invasion, which led to the Battle of Guandu in 200. Before Yuan Shao embarked on his campaign against Cao Cao, Ju Shou gathered all his family members and relatives and told them to divide the family fortune and disperse, because he knew that the Ju family would be in trouble if Yuan Shao lost the battle. Ju Shou's younger brother, Ju Zong (), disagreed that Yuan Shao would lose, but Ju Shou insisted that he was right. In 200, before the Battle of Boma (a prelude to the Battle of Guandu), Ju Shou warned Yuan Shao not to put Yan Liang in charge of leading the attack on Cao Cao's garrison at Boma (ÁôΩÈ¶¨; near present-day Hua County, Henan) because Yan Liang was petty and narrow-minded. Yuan Shao ignored him and sent Yan Liang anyway. Yan Liang was killed in action. Before Yuan Shao's main army crossed the Yellow River, Ju Shou advised Yuan Shao to remain at Yan Ford () and send detachments to attack Cao Cao's camp at Guandu () instead of going all-out to attack Guandu. When Yuan Shao did not heed his advice, Ju Shou sighed, claimed that he was ill and refused to meet anyone. Yuan Shao became very unhappy with Ju Shou and he gave command of Ju Shou's units to Guo Tu instead. After Yuan Shao lost the Battle of Yan Ford (a follow-up to the Battle of Boma), Ju Shou urged him to change strategy and fight a long-term war with Cao Cao so as to gradually wear down Cao Cao's forces over time. However, Yuan Shao refused to listen and insisted on sending his troops on an all-out confrontation with Cao Cao. In the initial stages of the Battle of Guandu, after Cao Cao's forces attacked one of Yuan Shao's supply convoys, Yuan Shao ordered his general Chunyu Qiong to take charge of transporting supplies and defend the supply depot at Wuchao (). When Ju Shou advised Yuan Shao to send Jiang Qi () to lead a unit to escort the supply convoy, Yuan Shao ignored him again. Yuan Shao ultimately lost the Battle of Guandu against Cao Cao when the latter led a successful raid on Wuchao and destroyed all of Yuan Shao's supplies. Ju Shou was captured by Cao Cao's men while Yuan Shao's forces were retreating after their defeat. When he was brought before Cao Cao, he remained stubborn and refused to surrender. Cao Cao not only did not harm him, but also treated him well even though he was a prisoner-of-war. Ju Shou was later killed by Cao Cao's men while attempting to escape and return to Yuan Shao. ==Family== Ju Shou had a son, Ju Hu (), who served under Yuan Shang after the latter succeeded his father as the Governor of Ji Province. Ju Hu was killed in action during the Battle of Ye in 204 against Cao Cao's forces. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Soon afterward he joined composer Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group. On their tour of the Soviet Union in 1963, he sang the roles of Sid and Tarquinius in Britten's operas Albert Herring and The Rape of Lucretia, respectively. In 1971, Britten composed the title role of his television opera Owen Wingrave specifically for Luxon's voice; Luxon created the role later that year with the English Opera Group. The following year, 1972, Luxon made his d√©but at both the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden - creating the role of the Jester in Peter Maxwell Davies' opera Taverner - and at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival, where he sang the title role in Raymond Leppard's realization of Monteverdi's Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria. Thereafter he became a frequent guest at both venues and also at Tanglewood in Massachusetts, USA. In 1974, Luxon began his long association with the English National Opera, which culminated in his appearance in the title role of Verdi's Falstaff in 1992. He made his Metropolitan Opera d√©but (as Eugene Onegin) in 1980, his La Scala d√©but in 1986, and his Los Angeles d√©but (as Wozzeck) in 1988. He sang in most of the major European opera houses and made frequent appearances in Munich (Bayerische Staatsoper) and Vienna (Wiener Staatsoper). In addition to his opera work, Luxon also developed a reputation as a concert-giver and recitalist with an unusually broad repertoire, ranging from early music through Lieder to contemporary song, music hall and folk music. He has also been recognised for his work rehabilitating parlour songs from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, particularly in partnership with Robert Tear. He made several appearances on BBC TV's long- running Music Hall Variety show, The Good Old Days, both with Robert Tear and on his own. His rendition of the song 'Give Me a ticket to Heaven' always met with tremendous acclaim. It was the song for which the BBC received the largest feedback of any featured on the programme. Luxon has made more than one hundred recordings, many featuring early and mid twentieth-century British songwriting and folksong arrangements by composers such as Britten, George Butterworth, Percy Grainger, Ivor Gurney, Roger Quilter, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gerald Finzi and Peter Warlock. His regular accompanist between 1961 and 1999 was the pianist David Willison. As a guest on the BBC's Desert Island Discs program, he said that his favourite piece of music is Thomas Tallis's Spem in alium. Luxon was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1986 Queen's Birthday Honours. Starting around 1990, Luxon began to be troubled by hearing loss. Though he explored a variety of conventional and 'alternative' treatments, continued fluctuation and deterioration in his hearing forced him to end his singing career by the end of the decade. Since then, however, Luxon has developed a career as a narrator and poetry reader, whilst continuing to give master classes and direct opera. He lives in the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts in the U.S. == Operatic roles == (Performed and/or recorded, listed alphabetically) { class= ! Role !! Opera !!

They have also recorded pieces in Aramaic and Bavarian. The Klezmatics wanted the Jewish culture and Yiddish language to live through the Klezmer band. ==Personnel== Current members include composers Matt Darriau, alto saxophone, clarinet, and kaval, and Frank London, on trumpet and keys, Paul Morrissett playing bass and tsimbl cimbalom, vocalist Lorin Sklamberg on accordion and piano, Lisa Gutkin on violin and vocals, and David Licht or Richie Barshay on drums. Past members include David Krakauer, Margot Leverett, Kurt Bjorling on the clarinet, Alicia Svigals on violin, and David Lindsay on bass. In addition, Boo Reiners, Susan McKeown, Joshua Nelson, Chava Alberstein, and Aaron Alexander have frequently collaborated with the band. ==History== The group formed in New York's East Village in 1986. They have appeared numerous times on television, including on the PBS Great Performances series, with Itzhak Perlman. The Klezmatics appeared live, in June 2003, in collaboration with the Jenaer Philharmonie of Jena, Germany. They have also participated in cross-cultural collaborations, notably with the Romani virtuoso Ferus Mustafov, Israeli singers Chava Alberstein and Ehud Banay, American singer Arlo Guthrie, and Moroccan musicians The Master Musicians of Jajouka. In Berlin, they worked with poet Allen Ginsberg. Trumpeter Frank London composed the score for Pilobolus Dance Theater's work, Davenen, which the band performed. The members come from different musical backgrounds. Drummer Richie Barshay plays jazz with Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea. Violinist Lisa Gutkin came from a predominantly Celtic background before joining the band. The Klezmatics' 20th anniversary concert took place at New York City's Town Hall on March 5, 2006. That event is included in the documentary chronicling the band's history and significance, The Klezmatics: On Holy Ground (2010).

Although the music draws primarily from a wide range of Americana, not klezmer, the album won a Grammy in the category of Best Contemporary World Music Album. Another album of Guthrie material, with music drawn from the band's more usual Yiddish, Eastern European Jewish music roots, Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah, was released the same year. Guthrie's granddaughter, Sarah Lee Guthrie, has appeared with them. Other key collaborations include the music to Tony Kushner's adaptation of The Dybbuk, \\"\\"A Dybbuk: Between Two Worlds‚Äù\\", The Well: Klezmatics with Chava Alberstein in which poetry by several prominent Yiddish poets was set to music, and Brother Moses Smote the Water with Jewish gospel-style singer, Joshua Nelson. ==Discography== *1989 ‚Äì Shvaygn = toyt (Piranha) *1990 ‚Äì Rhythm and Jews (Piranha) *1995 ‚Äì Jews with Horns (Flying Fish) *1997 ‚Äì Possessed (Xenophile) *1998 ‚Äì The Well: Klezmatics with Chava Alberstein (Xenophile) *2002 ‚Äì Rise Up!

In the early 1990s, after moving to Providence, Rhode Island, he started producing formally complex, often dark depictions of the urban, suburban, and industrial landscape. This work, which grew into the project titled \\"Wilderness\\" continued to evolve when Raphaelson moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1995. The work went unnoticed by the larger photography art world until it was discovered by Sandra S. Phillips of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. It later caught the attention of former Museum of Modern Art curator John Szarkowski, who acquired prints on behalf of private collections.https://photographyinterviews.blogspot.com/2012/06/paul- raphaelson-urban-disjunction.html Raphaelson began working in color in 2005, continuing to explore urban spaces bordering the occupied and abandoned, and the residential and industrial. In 2012 he brought a hand camera into the New York City Subway, photographing passengers through the reflections, obfuscations, and framing of the train windows.https://loeildelaphotographie.com/en/paul-raphaelson-sub-culture/ In 2013 he was the last photographer granted permission to photograph the Domino Sugar Refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, before its 2014 demolition and redevelopment.

The film features scenes with Jewish Defense League (JDL) leader Irv Rubin confronting American Nazis. The documentary was \\"Unofficially sanctioned by the Nazis and The Jewish Anti-Defamation League finds it too mild in its condemnation.\\" == Production == According to a report in The New York Times the journalist, John J.

Rida is said to have been one of the most influential and controversial scholars of his generationEncyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, Thompson Gale (2004), p.597 and was deeply influenced by the early Salafi Movement and the movement for Islamic Modernism founded in Egypt by Muhammad Abduh.Encyclopedia of Islam, Juan Campo, p. 581http://world- news-research.com/21sept2012.html Rida was born near Tripoli in Al-Qalamoun in Beirut Vilayet. His early education consisted of training in \\"traditional Islamic subjects\\". In 1884‚Äì5 he was first exposed to al-\`Urwa al-wuthqa, the journal of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Muhammad Abduh. In 1897 he left Syria for Cairo to collaborate with Abduh. The following year Rida launched al- Manar, a weekly and then monthly journal comprising Quranic commentary.Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, Thompson Gale (2004), p.597 ==Ideas and Controversies== Rashid Rida, was a leading exponent of Salafism Daniel Ungureanu, Wahhabism, Salafism and the Expansion of Islamic Fundamentalist Ideology, p146. and was especially critical of what he termed \\"blind following\\" of traditional Islam. He encouraged both laymen and scholars to interpret the primary sources of Islam themselves.Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 8. No. 731, 732 Applying this principle enabled Rida to tackle a number of subjects in a modern way and sometimes led to him holding unorthodox ideas that were considered controversial by some and progressive by others. One of his controversial views was his support of Darwin's theory of evolution.Rashid Rida, \\"Nazariyat Darwin wa al-Islam\\", al-Manar, vol 30. no. 8, March 1930, 593 - 600 To justify Darwinism, Rida considered it permissible to \\"interpret certain stories of the Qur'an in an allegorical manner, as, for example, the story of Adam\\".Charles C. Adams, Islam and Modernism in Egypt, p.187. Also, Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 8. no. 581, 582. He also believed that the origin of the human race from Adam is a history derived from the Hebrews and that Muslims are not obliged to believe in this account.Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 7, no. 483. Other controversial beliefs held by Rida included: \\\\- His view that usury (riba) may be permitted in certain cases (i.e. in cases of extreme poverty, wherein it would save their life) Rida stated that \\"usury may be permitted in cases of necessity (darurah)\\" John Stuart Mill, Principles of Political Economy, (1848, first edition), London, 1909, p. 926 \\\\- His idea that building statues is permissible in Islam as long as there is no danger of their being devoted to improper religious uses such as shirk (idolatry)Charles C. Adams, Islam and Modernism in Egypt, p.194. Also, Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 4, no 56 \\\\- His support of the British against the Ottomans Hasan Kayali, Arabs and Young Turks, Ottomanism, Arabism and Islamism in the Ottoman Empire 1908-1918, Berkeley, CA, 1997, p. 185 \\\\- His view that \\"the minute living bodies which today have been made known by the microscope and are called microbes, may possibly be a species of Jinn\\" Rashid Rida, Al-Manar, vol 4. No 334, 335 \\\\- His insistance that istislah is \\"a central rather than subsidiary principle for defining the law...[which] makes adaptions more flexible\\" and assertion that the \\"no harm no retribution\\" hadith is superior to all other principles of Shariah Rida focused on the relative weakness of Muslim societies vis-√†-vis Western colonialism, blaming Sufi excesses, the blind imitation of the past (taqlid), the stagnation of the ulama, and the resulting failure to achieve progress in science and technology. He held that these flaws could be alleviated by a return to what he saw as the true principles of Islam albeit interpreted (ijtihad) to suit modern realities.Glasse, Cyril, The New Encyclopedia of Islam, Altamira Press, 2001, p.384 This alone could, he believed, save Muslims from subordination to the colonial powers.Emmanuel Sivan, Radical Islam: Medieval Theology and Modern Politics, enl. Ed. (New Have: Yale University Press, 1990), p.101 Rida had a close relationship with Freemasonry,Karim Wissa, ‚ÄúFreemasonry in Egypt 1798-1921‚Ä≥. The British Society for Middle Eastern Studies Bulletin, vol.16, no.2, 1989 though his feelings toward the Bah√° º√≠ Faith were quite negative.Juan Cole, Muhammad \`Abduh and Rashid Rida - A Dialogue on the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. World Order (journal), vol. 15, nos. 3-4 (Spring/Summer 1981): pp. 7-16. Despite some controversial ideas held by Rida, his works and in particular his magazine al-Manar spread throughout the Muslim world influencing many individuals including the popular Salafi writer Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani.Richard Gauvain, Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God, Introduction, p.9. Prophet's Prayer (Sallallaahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) Described from the Beginning to the End as Though You See it, introduction, p4. \\"He began to specialize in the field of Hadith and its related sciences by the age of 20 -- being influenced by articles in Al-Manar magazine.\\" Muhammad Rashid Rida was one of the earliest critics of Zionism and wrote an article on the Movement as early as 1898.Be≈°ka, Emanuel: RESPONSES OF PROMINENT ARABS TOWARDS ZIONIST ASPIRATIONS AND COLONIZATION PRIOR TO 1908. In Asian and African Studies, 16, 1, 2007. Rida died on his way back to Cairo from Suez, where he had gone to see off his patron, King of Saudi Arabia Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.Soage, \\"Rashid Rida's Legacy\\", p. 2. ==Contributions to Islamist political thought== The corruption and tyranny of Muslim rulers (caliphs, sultans, etc.) throughout history was a central theme in Rida's criticisms. Rida, however, celebrated the rule of Muhammad and the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and leveled his attacks at subsequent rulers who could not maintain Muhammad's example. He also criticized the clergy (ulama) for compromising their integrity - and the integrity of the Islamic law (sharia) they were meant to uphold - by associating with worldly corrupt powers.Rida, Muhammad Rashid. 1934. Al-Khilafa aw al-Imama al-Uzma [The caliphate or the great imamate]. Cairo: Matba'at al-Manar bi-Misr, p. 57-65. Rida's ideas were foundational to the development of the modern \\"Islamic state\\". He \\"was an important link between classical theories of the caliphate, such as al- Mawardi's, and 20th-century notions of the Islamic state\\".Eickelman, D. F., & Piscatori, J. (1996). Muslim politics. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 31. Rida promoted a restoration or rejuvenation of the Caliphate for Islamic unity, and \\"democratic consultation on the part of the government, which he called 'shura'\\". In theology, his reformist ideas, like those of Abduh, were \\"based on the argument that: > shari'a consists of \`ibadat (worship) and mu'amalat (social relations). > Human reason has little scope in the former and Muslims should adhere to the > dictates of the Qur'an and hadith.

It was founded in 1934 with the intent to revive and continue the old traditions of the \\"Collegium musicum Jenense\\" and the academic concerts by the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (Friedrich-Schiller-Universit√§t Jena). In 1953 it became a symphonic orchestra and acquired its present-day status of philharmonic orchestra in 1969. It is the largest independent symphony orchestra in the central German state of Thuringia. In addition to the orchestra, the Philharmonic Choir (Philharmonischer Chor Jena), the Boys' Choir (Knabenchor der Jenaer Philharmonie), and the Jena Madrigal Choir (Jenaer Madrigalkreis) are parts of the Jenaer Philharmonie. The current Intendant of the orchestra is Bruno Scharnberg. Ernst Schwa√ümann was the orchestra's first Generalmusikdirektor (General Music Director, GMD), from 1934 to 1945. Andrey Boreyko, GMD from 1998 to 2003, now has the title of Ehrendirigent (honorary conductor) with the orchestra. Boreyko conducted the orchestra in commercial recordings for such labels as Teldec. In April 2012, the orchestra appointed the American conductor Marc Tardue as its next GMD, effective September 2012. Tardue concluded his tenure with the orchestra in 2017. In May 2017, the orchestra announced the appointment of Simon Gaudenz as its next GMD, effective with the 2018-2019 season.

The difference between the two represents the GDP gap. IMF estimates of the 2009 output gaps as % of GDP by country The GDP gap or the output gap is the difference between actual GDP or actual output and potential GDP. The calculation for the output gap is Y‚ÄìY* where Y is actual output and Y* is potential output. If this calculation yields a positive number it is called an inflationary gap and indicates the growth of aggregate demand is outpacing the growth of aggregate supply‚Äîpossibly creating inflation; if the calculation yields a negative number it is called a recessionary gap‚Äîpossibly signifying deflation. The percentage GDP gap is the actual GDP minus the potential GDP divided by the potential GDP. {(GDP_{actual} - GDP_{potential})}\\\\over{GDP_{potential}}. February 2013 data from the Congressional Budget Office showed that the United States had a projected output gap for 2013 of roughly $1 trillion, or nearly 6% of potential GDP. ==Okun's law: the relationship between output and unemployment== Okun's law is based on regression analysis of U.S. data that shows a correlation between unemployment and GDP. Okun's law can be stated as: For every 1% increase in cyclical unemployment (actual unemployment ‚Äì natural rate of unemployment), GDP will decrease by Œ≤%. %Output gap = ‚àíŒ≤ x %Cyclical unemployment This can also be expressed as: {{(Y-Y^{*})}\\\\over{Y^{*}}} = -\\\\beta{}(u-\\\\bar{u}) where: *Y is actual output *Y* is potential output *u is actual unemployment *≈´ is the natural rate of unemployment *Œ≤ is a constant derived from regression to show the link between deviations from natural output and natural unemployment. ==Consequences of a large output gap== A persistent, large output gap has severe consequences for, among other things, a country's labor market, a country's long-run economic potential, and a country's public finances. First, the longer the output gap persists, the longer the labor market will underperform, as output gaps indicate that workers who would like to work are instead idled because the economy is not producing to capacity. The United States' labor market slack is evident in an October 2013 unemployment rate of 7.3 percent, compared with an average annual rate of 4.6 percent in 2007, before the brunt of the recession struck. Second, the longer a sizable output gap persists, the more damage will be inflicted on an economy‚Äôs long-term potential through what economists term ‚Äúhysteresis effects.‚Äù In essence, workers and capital remaining idle for long stretches due to an economy operating below its capacity can cause long-lasting damage to workers and the broader economy. For example, the longer jobless workers remain unemployed, the more their skills and professional networks can atrophy, potentially rendering these workers unemployable. For the United States, this concern is especially salient given that the long-term unemployment rate‚Äîthe share of the unemployed who have been out of work for more than six months‚Äîstood at 36.9 percent in September 2013. Also, an underperforming economy can result in reduced investments in areas that pay dividends over the long term, such as education, and research and development. Such reductions are likely to impair an economy‚Äôs long-run potential. Third, a persistent, large output gap can have deleterious effects on a country‚Äôs public finances. This is partially because a struggling economy with a weak labor market results in forgone tax revenue, as unemployed or underemployed workers are either paying no income taxes, or paying less in income taxes than they would if fully employed. Additionally, a higher incidence of unemployment increases public spending on safety-net programs (in the United States, these include unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program). Reduced tax revenue and increased public spending both exacerbate budget deficits. Indeed, research has found that for each dollar U.S. gross domestic product moves away from potential output, U.S. cyclical budget deficits increase 37 cents. ==Potential policy responses to the U.S. output gap== Two proposals put forth by U.S. policymakers in recent years to stimulate the economy (and thereby help close the output gap) are the American Jobs Act (advanced by President Obama) and the Jobs Through Growth Act (developed by Senate Republicans). ===American Jobs Act=== The American Jobs Act reflects the preference for spurring economic growth through stimulating demand, which it would achieve primarily via stimulus spending and reduced taxes on workers. In the first year of implementation, Moody‚Äôs Analytics estimates the American Jobs Act would create 1.9 million jobs. Furthermore, Macroeconomic Advisers, a leading economic forecasting firm, estimates the American Jobs Act would boost GDP by 1.3 percent in its first year, an increase the firm characterizes as ‚Äúsignificant.‚Äù ===Jobs Through Growth Act=== The Jobs Through Growth Act embodies conservatives‚Äô belief that economic growth is best fostered through supply-side policies such as reducing taxes on the wealthy and cutting regulation, as well as by reducing government spending. Setting aside its provision for a balanced budget amendment, the Jobs Through Growth Act would likely have a negligible effect on jobs or GDP in the near term. However, if the balanced budget amendment were passed into law, it would result in a drastic reduction in government spending that would exacerbate the output gap. == Controversy on the EU's output gap measurements == The calculations of the output gap by the European Commission has come under heavy criticism by a range of academics and think tanks, in large part fostered by Robin Brooks, chief economist of the prestigious Institute of International Finance, who have launched a \\"campaign against nonsense output gaps.\\"2019, May, Robin Brooks, Campaign against nonsense output gaps The criticism addressed to the European Commission include the complexity and contradictions in the methodology (which is in fact the one proposed by experts sitting in the \\"Output Gap Working Group\\" and approved by finance ministers in the ECOFIN meetings). Critics argue the methodology results in a highly pro-cyclical output gap indexes, and sometimes implausible outcomes, in particular in the case of Italy. In September 2019, several senior officials from the European Commission's including the Director General of the DG ECFIN, Mr Marco Buti, have written a joint article refuting this criticism. But the critics said they remained unconvinced. ==See also== * Phillips curve * ZIRP * NAIRU ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gross domestic product ","title":"Output gap"},{"id":"3259225","text":"Misfit may refer to: ==Film, books, and television== * \\"Misfit\\" (short story), a 1939 short story by Robert A.

He plays for the Brumbies in Super Rugby. He also played internationally for Australia. He began his Australia career as a centre, but now mainly plays wing. ==Career== He spent his entire childhood in Durban and played most of his rugby as a South African junior, representing South African Schools and even captaining the under-21 national team to victory in the 2002 U21 Rugby World Cup. In the same year, he made his debut in the then-Super 12 for the Sharks. However, at the end of 2002, he chose to move to Australia, for which he was qualified to play by virtue of having an Australia-born paternal grandmother. Rathbone joined the Brumbies for the 2003 season. After considerable speculation in the rugby world over which country he would represent at Test level, he opted for the Wallabies, which resulted in Rathbone being heavily criticised in much of the South African press. Rathbone made his Test debut in June 2004 against Scotland, and went on to score a hat trick of tries against England the following week. His form in the June Tests earned him a starting wing position for that year's Tri Nations Series. During that competition, he rubbed salt into the South African wounds by scoring a match-winning try against his former countrymen in Perth. When the Wallabies went on tour that November, he scored a pair of tries against Scotland at Murrayfield, but suffered a groin injury that kept him out of the year's final Test against England. In 2005, Rathbone was injured for most of the year, missing the Autumn series of Tests. In 2006 Rathbone married to his longtime girlfriend in their hometown of Durban. In 2008, after 15 months out of rugby due to knee surgery for a torn patellar tendon, Rathbone signed a Shute Shield contract with the east-Sydney based team, Easts. In 2009, after many injuries that have seen him sidelined, he decided to retire. On 23 August 2012, Rathbone announced his intention to return to professional Rugby after three years out of the game. Rathbone signed a one-year contract with his old club, the Brumbies, with an option to extend. ==References== ==External links== *Brumbies profile *Profile at official Australian Rugby Union site *Rathbone signs for Easts Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:South African people of British descent Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:Brumbies players Category:Sharks (rugby union) players Category:Naturalised citizens of Australia Category:Sportspeople from Canberra Category:Sportspeople from Durban Category:Rugby union centres Category:Rugby union wings Category:South African emigrants to Australia Category:South African rugby union players Category:Super Rugby players ","title":"Clyde Rathbone"},{"id":"3259259","text":"Approximate territory of the Jaega chiefdom in the late 17th Century The Jaega (also Jega, Xega, Jaece, Geiga) were Native Americans living in a chiefdom of the same name, which included the coastal parts of present-day Martin County and Palm Beach County, Florida at the time of initial European contact, and until the 18th century. The area occupied by the Jaega corresponds to the East Okeechobee Area, an archaeological culture that is part of, or closely related to, the Belle Glade culture. The name Job√©, or Jov√© , has been identified as a synonym of Jaega, a sub-group of the Jaega, or a town of the Jaega. ==History== Partial map showing Jaega (Xega) presence in South Florida (c. 1600) The East Okeechobee Area has received relatively little attention from archaeologists, and little is known of the origins of the Jaega. The earliest mention of the Jaega came from Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, who was held captive by indigenous peoples in Florida for 17 years until 1665 or 1666. He relates that the Jaega, along with the Ais and the obscure Guacata, salvaged precious metals and other goods from ships that wrecked along the Florida coast. Escalante Fontaneda also implied that the Jaega spoke the same language as the Ais, who lived along the Indian River Lagoon to the north of the Jaega. The Jaega may have been related to the Ais people, who occupied the coast to their north. (The Ais language has been linked to the Chitimacha language by linguist Julian Granberry.) The Jaega were linked to the Ais by marriage between chiefs and their relatives.Brech:125 In 1665, the Spanish built the Presidio of Santa Lucia at what is probably the present-day St. Lucie River in the territory of the Ais people. The Spanish were soon driven out of Ais territory and built a new fort called Santa Lucia at the Jupiter Inlet, in Jaega territory. The Jaega were initially friendly towards the Spanish, but later attacked the presidio and forced the Spanish to withdraw less than a year later. Jonathan Dickinson placed the Ais town he called Santa Lucea two days' travel north of the Jupiter Inlet. The names Jaega and Job√© (or variants thereof) appear on 17th-century Spanish maps of Florida, and in Spanish reports. The displayed partial map is titled Planta de la costa de la Florida'y en que paraje La Laguna de Ma'ymi'y adonde se ha de hacer un fuerte (Map of the coast of La Florida and in which spot the Lake of Maimi and to where we have to make a fort) dated circa 1600. The original is in the Archives of the Indies in Sevilla, Spain, identified as Maps de Mexico y Florida from the collection of Pedro Torre Lanzas, cartographer unknown. A reproduction is held by the Library of Congress.Old Florida Maps.com It shows the relative locations of Saint Augustine (S Agustin), Cape Canaveral (Cabo de Ca√±abezal), as well as the approximate territories of the Ays (Ais) and Xega tribes. Jonathan Dickinson, who was part of a shipwrecked party detained in the town of Job√© for several days in 1696, wrote a Journal that contains descriptions of the people of Job√© (near present-day Jupiter Inlet). He wrote that Job√© was subject to the Ais chief who resided in Jece (near present-day Vero Beach). ==Culture== There is little written history about the Jaega. They were likely similar in culture and custom to the surrounding Calusa, Tekesta and Ais tribes. The indigenous peoples of South Florida were all hunter- gatherers. Food was abundant enough to make agriculture unnecessary. Middens (Refuse mounds), consisting mostly of oyster and conch shells, also contain clues to the Jaega culture. Their diet consisted mainly of fish, shellfish, sea turtles, deer and raccoon, as well as wild plants including coco palms, sea grapes, palmetto berries and tubers.Early Tribes: Jaega and Jobe, Palm Beach County History Online Bits of broken pots and scraps of grass skirts demonstrate that crafts including pottery and weaving were known and practiced. One of the largest and best preserved Jaega middens is within what is now DuBois Park at the Jupiter Inlet Historic and Archeological Site, across from the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse. Although there are no deposits of flint in South Florida, flint dart points have been found at Jaega sites, indicating trade with northern tribes. The people used wood, bone and shell to craft tools and weapons. Spanish reports describe elaborate ceremonies involving an elite class of priests, hundreds of singers and dancers, and complex ritual practice.Jonathan W. Koontz, Lake Worth: Jewel of the Gold Coast, Lake Worth Chamber of Commerce, 1997, pp. 41-46. ==Later names== The geographic name \\"Hobe Sound\\" is derived from the name of the Jaega village of Job√©. The Spanish pronounced the name \\"Ho-bay,\\" which has evolved into the current anglicized \\"Hobe\\" (which is pronounced like \\"robe\\"). The name of the Jupiter Inlet may have been derived from \\"Jov√©\\", anglicized as \\"Jove\\". ==Notes== == References == * *Brech, Alan (2004).

He is the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind. ==Early life and education== Hassabis was born to a Greek Cypriot father and a Chinese Singaporean mother and grew up in North London. A child prodigy in chess, Hassabis reached master standard at the age of 13 with an Elo rating of 2300 and captained many of the England junior chess teams. He represented the University of Cambridge in the Oxford-Cambridge varsity chess matches of 1995,1995 Varsity Chess Match, Oxford v Cambridge - http://www.saund.co.uk/britbase/pgn/199503vars-viewer.html - BritBase 19961996 Varsity Chess Match, Oxford v Cambridge - http://www.saund.co.uk/britbase/pgn/199603vars-viewer.html - BritBase and 1997,1997 Varsity Chess Match, Oxford v Cambridge - http://www.saund.co.uk/britbase/pgn/199703vars-viewer.html - BritBase winning a half blue. Hassabis was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, a state- funded comprehensive school in East Finchley, North London. He completed his GCE Advanced Level and Scholarship Level exams early at the age of 15 and 16. ===Bullfrog=== Hassabis began his computer games career at Bullfrog Productions, first level designing on Syndicate and then at 17 co-designing and lead programming on the 1994 game Theme Park, with the games designer Peter Molyneux. Theme Park, a simulation video game, sold over ten million copies and won a Golden Joystick Award, and inspired a whole genre of management sim games. ===University of Cambridge=== Hassabis then left Bullfrog to study at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he completed the Computer Science Tripos graduating in 1997 with a Double First from the University of Cambridge. ==Career after graduation== ===Lionhead=== After graduating from Cambridge, Hassabis worked at Lionhead Studios. Games designer Peter Molyneux, with whom Hassabis had worked at Bullfrog Productions, had recently founded the company. At Lionhead, Hassabis worked as lead AI programmer on the 2001 \\"god\\" game Black & White. ===Elixir Studios=== Hassabis left Lionhead in 1998 to found Elixir Studios, a London-based independent games developer, signing publishing deals with Eidos Interactive, Vivendi Universal and Microsoft. In addition to managing the company, Hassabis served as executive designer of the BAFTA-nominated games Republic: The Revolution and Evil Genius. The release of Elixir's first game, Republic: The Revolution, a highly ambitious and unusual political simulation game, was delayed due to its huge scope. The final game was reduced from its original vision and greeted with lukewarm reviews, receiving a Metacritic score of 62/100. Evil Genius, a tongue-in-cheek Bond villain simulator, fared much better with a score of 75/100. In April 2005 the intellectual property and technology rights were sold to various publishers and the studio was closed. ===University College London and neuroscience=== Demis Hassabis (left) with right Following Elixir Studios, Hassabis returned to academia to obtain his PhD in cognitive neuroscience from University College London (UCL) in 2009 supervised by Eleanor Maguire. He sought to find inspiration in the human brain for new AI algorithms. He continued his neuroscience and artificial intelligence research as a visiting scientist jointly at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), under Tomaso Poggio, and Harvard University, before earning a Henry Wellcome postdoctoral research fellowship to the Gatsby Charitable Foundation Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL in 2009. Working in the field of autobiographical memory and amnesia, he co-authored several influential papers published in Nature, Science, Neuron and PNAS. One of his most highly cited papers, published in PNAS, showed systematically for the first time that patients with damage to their hippocampus, known to cause amnesia, were also unable to imagine themselves in new experiences. The finding established a link between the constructive process of imagination and the reconstructive process of episodic memory recall. Based on this work and a follow-up Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, Hassabis developed a new theoretical account of the episodic memory system identifying scene construction, the generation and online maintenance of a complex and coherent scene, as a key process underlying both memory recall and imagination. This work received widespread coverage in the mainstream media and was listed in the top 10 scientific breakthroughs of the year in any field by the journal Science. ===DeepMind=== Hassabis is the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, a machine learning AI startup, founded in London in 2010 with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. Hassabis met Legg when both were postdocs at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, and he and Suleyman had been friends through family. Hassabis also recruited his university friend and Elixir partner David Silver. DeepMind's mission is to \\"solve intelligence\\" and then use intelligence \\"to solve everything else\\". More concretely, DeepMind aims to meld insights from neuroscience and machine learning with new developments in computing hardware to unlock increasingly powerful general- purpose learning algorithms that will work towards the creation of an artificial general intelligence (AGI). The company has focused on training learning algorithms to master games, and in December 2013 it famously announced that it had made a pioneering breakthrough by training an algorithm called a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to play Atari games at a superhuman level by only using the raw pixels on the screen as inputs. DeepMind's early investors included several high-profile tech entrepreneurs. In 2014, Google purchased DeepMind for ¬£400 million, although most of the company has remained an independent entity based in London, DeepMind Health has since been directly incorporated into Google Health. Since the Google acquisition, the company has notched up a number of significant achievements, perhaps the most notable being the creation of AlphaGo, a program that defeated world champion Lee Sedol at the complex game of Go. Go had been considered a holy grail of AI, for its high number of possible board positions and resistance to existing programming techniques. However, AlphaGo beat European champion Fan Hui 5-0 in October 2015 before winning 4-1 against former world champion Lee Sedol in March 2016. Additional DeepMind accomplishments include creating a Neural Turing machine, advancing research on AI safety, and the creation of a partnership with the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom and Moorfields Eye Hospital to improve medical service and identify the onset of degenerative eye conditions. More recently, DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein-folding, one of the toughest problems in science. In December 2018, DeepMind's tool AlphaFold won the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins. \\"This is a lighthouse project, our first major investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental, very important, real-world scientific problem\\", Hassabis said to the Guardian.

Daugherty, 1999. == Biography == Joy Bright was born in Wildwood, New Jersey on 4 May 1898. During World War I, after attending business school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she enlisted in the Navy as a Yeoman (F), serving at Camden, New Jersey and at Naval Air Station Wildwood.Laurie, Maxine N.; and Mappen, Marc; Encyclopedia of New Jersey: Rutgers University Press; 2004/2005. p. 558. Joy Bright Hancock, February 1918 Following the war, she married Lieutenant Charles Gray Little, who was killed in the crash of the airship ZR-2 in 1921. A year later, she obtained employment with the Bureau of Aeronautics, where her duties including editing the Bureau's News Letter, which later evolved into the magazine Naval Aviation News. In 1924, she left the Bureau to marry Lieutenant Commander Lewis Hancock, Jr., who lost his life when airship crashed in September 1925. Joy Bright Hancock returned to the Bureau after attending Foreign Service School and obtaining a private pilot's license. For more than a decade before World War II and into the first year of that conflict, she was responsible for the Bureau's public affairs activities. On October 15, 1942, she was commissioned as a lieutenant in the newly formed Women's Reserve, commonly known as Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). She initially served as WAVES representative in the Bureau of Aeronautics and later in a similar position for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air). She was promoted to lieutenant commander on November 26, 1943 and to the rank of commander by the end of the War. In February 1946, Commander Hancock became the Assistant Director (Plans) of the Women's Reserve and was promoted to WAVES' Director in July of that year. She was promoted to the rank of captain on October 15, 1948.Register of Commissioned Officers of the U.S. Navy. 1950. pg. 21. Her promotion to captain after only 6 years of service was one of fastest progressions to that rank in the Navy's history. She guided the WAVES through the difficult years of Naval contraction in the later 1940s and the expansion of the early 1950s, a period that also saw the Navy's women achieve status as part of the Regular Navy. Captain Hancock retired from active duty in June 1953. The next year, she married Vice Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie and accompanied him on his 1955‚Äì56 tour as Commander, Sixth Fleet. Following her husband's death in late 1956, she lived in the Washington, D.C., area and in the Virgin Islands. Hancock published her autobiography, Lady in the Navy: A Personal Reminiscence, in 1972. She died on 20 August 1986, aged 88, in Bethesda, Maryland. She was buried with her husband, Admiral Ofstie, at Arlington National Cemetery. == Awards == Captain Joy Bright Hancock, USN; portrait by David Komuro, c. 1953. *Legion of Merit *Navy Commendation Medal *World War I Victory Medal *American Campaign Medal *World War II Victory Medal *National Defense Service Medal == See also == * Women in the United States Navy * WAVES * Yeoman (F) == References == ==Further reading== * Alsmeyer, Marie Bennett.

Because of this, he had a maximum height of 3 ft 9 in at adult age. His dwarfism resulted in multiple medical problems. In 2000, he said in an interview with John Norris from MTV that he had to take 60 pills daily and required constant medical treatment. His Los Angeles Times obituary stated Calleja's medical regimen had required taking 65 pills daily, in addition to undergoing daily dialysis. ==Career== Calleja first met fellow Michigan musician Kid Rock at a concert by the latter in Roseville, Michigan in 1994. In a backstage interview conducted by disc jockey Julie Slater of New York FM radio station K-Rock (WXRK) on July 24, 1999, after Kid Rock's performance at Woodstock 99, the artist said Calleja \\"used to come to all my shows, he would be standing on tables in the front row singing the lyrics.\\" Kid Rock said in the interview that he mistakenly thought Joe C. was a child. Calleja asked a mutual acquaintance to tell Rock he wanted to smoke a joint with him, Rock said, after which the pair formally met and Rock learned Calleja was actually a 21-year-old adult. \\"He's talking and I'm like, would you like a job? He's like, I can't do anything. I'm like, it's not important right now. I was like, you got attitude flying all over this room. I was like, I'll teach you everything you need to know.\\" In November 1999, Calleja had to leave the tour with Kid Rock, only appearing in a few programs from this issue. He appeared on television, including a guest role with Kid Rock on the animated series The Simpsons, on the Season 11 episode \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\". Joe C. was a World Wrestling Federation fan and made various references to the WWF stable D-Generation X during concerts. He appeared on the May 18, 2000, edition of WWF Smackdown during a taping in Detroit to drink beer with The Acolytes, and on the May 29 edition of Raw Is War, helping Too Cool win their only WWF Tag Team Championship in 2000 from Edge and Christian. He was also featured posthumously in the animated film Osmosis Jones as a part of Kidney Rock. ==Death== On November 16, 2000, one week after he had turned 26, Calleja died in his sleep from celiac disease complications while visiting his parents in his hometown of Taylor, Michigan. His mother found him dead the next morning. Kid Rock released a statement on Calleja's death: \\"Family and friends are everything; without them, all of the fame and fortune means nothing. We have lost part of our family. Joey gave us, and the world, his love. He brought a smile to everyone who has ever known or seen him. In a world full of confusion, Joey made all of us laugh. No matter what color, religion, race, or beliefs we have, he made us all smile. He gave us the gift of joy. Joey, thank you. We will never forget you. We love you.\\" Rock dedicated his 2001 album Cocky to Calleja.

Murus Dacicus (Latin for Dacian Wall) is a construction method for defensive walls and fortifications developed in ancient Dacia sometime before the Roman conquest. It is a mix between traditional construction methods particular to Dacian builders and methods imported from Greek and Roman architecture and masonry, and ‚Äì although somewhat similar construction techniques were used before, during and long after the period ‚Äì it has peculiarities that make it unique. ==Design== Murus Dacicus consisted of two outer walls made out of stone blocks carved in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped; apparently no mortar was used, thus making them examples of ashlar masonry ‚Äì but typically done with regular sized, bigger-than-average blocks, due to technological requirements. After each layer of the outer walls was completed, the gap between them would be filled with gravel and rocks cemented together with clay and compacted (cf. also rammed earth technique). The structure was strengthened and consolidated at the level of each layer by horizontal, singed/scorched wood tie beams connected to the outer walls by means of a dovetail joint at the upper surface of the stone block (hence the need for big stone blocks of the same size). Due to its higher flexibility, this structure had a distinct advantage over the 'classical', solid dry stone wall (as seen, e. g., in the cyclopean and ashlar walls in Mycenae): a higher capability of shock absorption and dissipation of kinetic energy from an incoming projectile thrown by a siege weapon. However, archaeological and historical evidence suggests that the wall might have been topped by a wooden palisade instead of stone battlements, which had the obvious disadvantage of being vulnerable to fire. A properly built Dacian Wall would be both labor-intensive and time-consuming. A typical wall for the late period, hastily built in the years between the two Dacian Wars (when Dacia had to rebuild, repair, enlarge or reinforce the defenses of many of its key fortresses), would be about 3‚Äì4 meters thick and 10 m tall, an outstanding achievement in the given conditions. The Dacian Fortresses of the OrƒÉ≈ütie Mountains, UNESCO World Heritage Sites are examples of citadels built using this method. Also the Dacian walls are depicted on the Trajan's column in Rome.

The village is home to Bible Hill Junior High School, Bible Hill Consolidated Elementary School and the Dalhousie University Faculty of Agriculture. The Bible Hill Estates Trailer Park has been used as a filming location for the Trailer Park Boys television series service as the Sunnyvale Trailer Park ==History== The name Bible Hill is derived from a prominent hill which rises above the flood plain on the grounds of the Dalhousie University Faculty of Agriculture (formerly the Nova Scotia Agricultural College) on the northern bank of the Salmon River. It was believed that the hill took its name from Matthew Archibald (1745‚Äì1820), the son of one of the first Irish settlers in the area. He was locally renowned for his piety and extensive use of the Bible. It was thought that the name of the hill on which he lived came from his use of the Bible. It is suggested that name stuck when Joseph Howe coined the term on one of his visits to this house on the hill. Contrary to this long-standing legend, the origin of the name is currently believed to have come from the work of Rev. Dr. William McCullough (1811‚Äì1895) several years later. p. 295 Coincidentally, McCullough lived in the house built by Matthew Archibald many years earlier. He was the minister of Truro's First Presbyterian church (now First United Church) from 1839‚Äì1885, and had inherited an interest in Bible distribution from his father, Dr. Thomas McCullough, one of the founders of the Nova Scotia Bible Society. He distributed Bibles, free of charge, to anyone who wanted one. Over the almost 50 years of Rev. McCullough's ministry, the hill on which he lived, where one could obtain a Bible free of charge, became known as Bible Hill. ==References== ==External links== * Bible Hill Website Category:Communities in Colchester County Category:Villages in Nova Scotia ","title":"Bible Hill, Nova Scotia"},{"id":"3259287","text":"When creating computer-generated imagery, final scenes appearing in movies and television productions are usually produced by rendering more than one \\"layer\\" or \\"pass,\\" which are multiple images designed to be put together through digital compositing to form a completed frame.

The first references to the Silviatti family are in a 1225 census report taken by the town fathers of Sesto di Firenze. They are listed as 'bankers' or 'money-changers' depending upon interpretation of the dialect. Prominent members of the family include Giacopo Silviatti, a majordomo in the house of Lorenzo de' Medici, and Gianfranco Silviatti, an acting mayor of Sesto di Firenze in the 16th century. The family has remained fairly prominent in the region well into the modern era. In 1923, the head of the family, Domenico Silviatti, was arrested for vocally protesting the appointment of Benito Mussolini as dictator by King Victor Emmanuel III. Although a political nonentity, Domenico's ongoing ties to the Medici family and Tuscan nobility gave him considerable financial backing and a voice in the region. After being imprisoned for two years, Domenico's wife, Alessandria Pella managed to arrange his release in 1925. The family fled Italy to the United States with the immediate family of one of Domenico's political accomplices, Salvatore De Lorenzo (a distant Medici relative) in 1926, arriving in New York and settling in the Lake Placid area. The family then faded from prominence for the remainder of the Second World War, but in the mid-1980s, the grandson of Domenico Silviatti, Giancarlo Silviatti (John C. Silviatti) would return the family name to prominence working for the American Express Corporation as the orchestrator of the Shearson Loeb Rhoades purchase, as well as that of the IDS Company.

Alan reminisces an affair he had 14 years earlier while working as a cabana boy at an unnamed opulent beach hotel, where he falls in love with Ella Brice (Mol), the beautiful wife of business mogul Mark Brice (Liotta). At first resistant, Ella reciprocates his love, and things seem to go well for some time but eventually Mark finds out after Ella confesses her affair at church. After framing him of drug possession and getting him incarcerated, Mark offers Alan a chance for freedom by simply dropping the affair and never looking for Ella again. Despite this, Alan is undeterred and even mails letters to Ella, including one with a fingerprint in his blood. Mark decides to have Alan shot and buried alive in a construction site. Though disfigured, Alan survives and goes to Javier's to convalescence and plan his revenge. He murders a Cuban eminent criminal attorney with underworld connections, named Manuel Esquema, whose identity he assumes. Now as Esquema, Alan arrives in Miami to meet with Brice who is in legal troubles. Brice later arranges a meeting over dinner at his place, to which Esquema eagerly goes. As he arrives, he is greeted by Ella, but is a bit dismayed when she does not recognize him over his disfigurement and chinstrap beard. Esquema constantly stares at her, which Ella notices. Esquema asks about the way Ella has coped with her husband's circumstances, to which she replies she constantly reads Madame Bovary. When Mark questions the cause of his disfigurement, Esquema states it was a birth accident. After he leaves, Ella questions Mark about Esquema, which he angrily brushes off. The following day, Esquema sights Ella at a restaurant where she meets with him supposedly to continue describing Mark's lifestyle, where he admits to not be interested in knowing more about him, but rather about her. Ella suddenly leaves the restaurant, forgetting her car keys inside. When Esquema gives them back, he offers to keep on meeting with her as he correctly deduces her loneliness is affecting her. Ella reluctantly declines. Later, Mark's associate assaults both Esquema and Javier demanding them to lay off following Ella. As the associate goes on a tanning salon, Javier secretly follows and murders him. ==Home Video== The film was released on DVD on May 22, 2001. == Production == It was filmed in St. Petersburg, Florida and at the Don CeSar Beach Resort, located in St. Petersburg Beach. ==References== == External links == * * * Category:1999 films Category:1999 crime drama films Category:Films directed by Paul Schrader Category:British films Category:British crime drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian crime drama films Category:English- language films Category:American crime drama films Category:American films Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Schrader Category:Films scored by Angelo Badalamenti Category:1999 drama films ","title":"Forever Mine"},{"id":"3259318","text":"Michael Fagan (born 8 August 1948) is a British man who entered Queen Elizabeth II's bedroom in Buckingham Palace in 1982.

He was a steel erector and a \\"champion safe- breaker.\\" He had two younger sisters, Margaret and Elizabeth. In 1955, he attended Compton Street School in Clerkenwell (now St. Peter & St. Paul RC Primary School). In 1966, he left home at 18 to escape from his father, who, Fagan says, was violent. He started working as a painter and decorator. In 1972, he married Christine, with whom he had four children. ===Break-ins=== Buckingham Palace (2009) ====First entry==== According to his own account, the 9 July 1982 incident was Fagan's second intrusion on the palace. The first happened about a month before. Fagan says he shimmied up the drainpipe, startling a housemaid, who called security. When guards reached the scene, Fagan had disappeared, leading them to believe the housemaid was mistaken. Fagan claims he entered the palace through an unlocked window on the roof and spent the next half-hour eating cheddar cheese and crackers and wandering around. He tripped several alarms, but they were faulty. He claims to have viewed royal portraits and rested for a while on the throne. He also spoke of entering the postroom, where Diana, Princess of Wales, had hidden presents for her son, William, who had been born the previous month. Fagan said he drank half a bottle of white wine before becoming tired and leaving. ====Second entry==== At around 7:00 am on 9 July 1982, Fagan scaled Buckingham Palace's perimeter wall, which was topped with revolving spikes and barbed wire, and climbed up a drainpipe before wandering into the Queen's bedroom at about 7:15 am. An alarm sensor had detected his movements inside the palace, but police thought the alarm was faulty and silenced it. Fagan wandered the palace corridors for several minutes before reaching the section where the royal apartments were located. In an anteroom Fagan broke a glass ashtray, cutting his hand. He was still carrying a fragment of the glass when he entered the Queen's bedroom. The Queen woke when he disturbed a curtain, and initial reports said Fagan sat on the edge of her bed. However, in a 2012 interview, he said she left the room immediately to seek security. She had phoned the palace switchboard twice for police, but none had arrived. Fagan then asked for some cigarettes, which were brought by a maid, who had been cleaning a neighbouring room. The duty footman, Paul Whybrew, who had been walking the Queen's dogs, then appeared, followed by two policemen on palace duty who removed Fagan. The incident had happened as the armed police officer outside the royal bedroom came off duty before his replacement arrived.\\"Whitelaw launches Palace inquiry\\", Martin Linton and Martin Wainwright, The Guardian, 13 July 1982 A subsequent police report was critical of the competence of officers on duty, as well as a system of confused and divided command.\\"TEXT OF SCOTLAND YARD'S REPORT ON JULY 9 INTRUSION INTO BUCKINGHAM PALACE\\", The New York Times, 22 July 1982 ===Arrest=== Since it was then a civil wrong rather than a criminal offence, Fagan was not charged for trespassing in the Queen's bedroom.(Dennis J, Baker, Glanville Williams: Textbook of Criminal Law, London, 2012, Sweet & Maxwell at p. 1256) He was charged with theft (of the wine), but the charges were dropped when he was committed for psychiatric evaluation. In late July, Fagan's mother said, \\"He thinks so much of the Queen. I can imagine him just wanting to simply talk and say hello and discuss his problems.\\"\\"God Save the Queen, Fast\\" Spencer Davidson, Time, 26 July 1982, page 33 He spent the next six months in a psychiatric hospital before being released on 21 January 1983. It was not until 2007, when Buckingham Palace became a \\"designated site\\" for the purposes of section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, that such an offence as his became criminal. ===Later life=== Two years after entering Buckingham Palace, Fagan attacked a policeman at a caf√© in Fishguard, Wales, and was given a three- month suspended sentence. In 1983, Fagan recorded a cover version of the Sex Pistols song \\"God Save the Queen\\" with punk band the Bollock Brothers. He was found guilty of indecent exposure in 1987 after he was spotted running around without trousers on waste ground in Chingford, London. In 1997, he was imprisoned for four years after he, his wife and their 20-year-old son were charged with conspiring to supply heroin. Fagan made an appearance in Channel 4's The Antics Roadshow,The Antics Roadshow (Channel 4, August 2011) an hour- long 2011 TV documentary directed by the artist Banksy charting the history of people behaving oddly in public. ==In fiction== The palace intrusion was adapted in 2012 for an episode of Sky Arts' Playhouse Presents series entitled Walking the Dogs, a one-off British comedy drama starring Emma Thompson as the monarch. ==See also== * The boy Jones == References == == External links == * Text of Scotland Yard's Report on July 9 Intrusion Into Buckingham Palace, The New York Times, 22 July 1982 Category:1948 births Category:1982 in London Category:1980s in the City of Westminster Category:20th-century English criminals Category:Buckingham Palace Category:Criminals from London Category:English male criminals Category:July 1982 events in the United Kingdom Category:Living people Category:People from Clerkenwell ","title":"Michael Fagan (intruder)"},{"id":"3259327","text":"The Zealots of Piety (Russian: –ö—Ä—É–∂–æ–∫ —Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—á–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è) was a circle of ecclesiastical and secular individuals beginning in the late 1630s in Russia at the time of church schism, which gathered around Stefan Vonifatiyev, the confessor of tsar Alexei Mikhailovich. The impetus to the group's formation was the Time of Troubles. The members believed the massacres and conflagrations of the time to be the manifestation of a wrathful God, angry with the Russian people's lack of religiosity. In response, the group called for the rebirth of the Russian Orthodox faith, and a renewal of the religious piety of the masses. The Zealots of Piety included Fyodor Rtishchev, Archmandrite Nikon (Minin) of the Novospassky Monastery (future Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia), Abbot Ivan Neronov of the Kazan Cathedral, archpriests Avvakum Petrov, Loggin, Lazar, and Daniil. The members of the Zealots of Piety wanted to enhance the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church and increase its influence upon the people. Among other goals of the circle were the struggle against the shortcomings and vices of the clergy, revival of church sermons and other means for influencing the masses. They also aimed to assist the needy and weak in Russian society, protecting them from social injustice, and to spread the Gospel to the Russian people, making faith more integral in daily life. The Zealots of Piety soon became the actual rulers of the Russian Orthodox Church, thanks to the support from the tsar, who had paid much attention to the advice of his confessor. After Nikon had been elected patriarch in 1652, the groups turned against their former member, protesting several of his reforms. Over time, the group began to dissolve, as many of its members became active figures in the Old Believers movement. ==References== Category:17th century in Russia Category:Old Believer movement Category:Russian Orthodox Church in Russia Category:History of the Russian Orthodox Church ","title":"Zealots of Piety"},{"id":"3259343","text":"A Sovtek MIG-50 amplifier on top of an SWR Henry 8x8 speaker cabinetSovtek is a brand of vacuum tube owned by Mike Matthews's New Sensor Corporation and manufactured in Saratov, Russia.

Carved trees are created as a form of artistic and spiritual expression by some Aboriginal peoples, to mark sites of significance such as burial sites. An Aboriginal scarred tree, probably used to make a coolamons (Parramatta, NSW). ==Description== Wiradjuri carved tree, Grave of Yuranigh. c. 1850. Bark was removed by making deep cuts in a tree with a stone pickaxe or other similar tool. The area of bark removed is typically regular in shape, often with parallel sides and slightly pointed or rounded ends, and the scar usually stops above ground level. Australian native Eucalypt species such as box and red gum (especially in Victoria), or whichever species are native in the area. Scars remain in trees that are often over 200 years old. Sometimes there is exposed sapwood at the base or at the top of the scar, showing axe cuts. Aboriginal people removed bark from trees to make things like canoes, containers and shields, as well as to build temporary shelters. Sometimes they cut toe holds for ease of climbing, with the trees used as lookouts or to hunt for bush foods. To remove bark, the Aboriginal people cut an outline of the shape they wanted using stone axes or, once Europeans had arrived, steel axes. The bark was then levered off. Sometimes the axe marks made by Aboriginal people are still visible on the sapwood of the tree, but usually the marks will be hidden because the bark has grown back. The amount of bark regrowth may help you tell the age of the scar. Sometimes, if the scar is very old, it will be completely covered by regrowth Non-Indigenous Australians called the trees thus marked as scarred trees, scar trees, canoe trees or shield trees. In the 17th century, dugout canoe technology appeared in Australia, to supplement the bark canoe, causing many changes to both the hunting practices and the society of the Aboriginal peoples. ==Carved trees== Carved tree created in 2012Carved trees are mainly found in New South Wales, and are the work specifically of Gamilaroi and Wiradjuri artists. They were created to mark sites of particular ceremonial significance, such as initiation or burial sites. They are also known as arborglyphs, dendroglyphs and teleteglyphs. During the 19th century, sections of these carved trees were removed and placed in museums, but there is now a move not only to return these trees to the land of origin, but also to revive the practice of carved trees. ==Locations== Scarred trees are found among mature native trees, especially box gum and red gum trees, along rivers and lakes and at sacred sites. They are protected by legislation. Canoe trees have been photographed along the Murray River at Waikerie and Kroehns Landing at Nildottie in South Australia, and on the Murrumbidgee River near Hay, New South Wales. RMIT Bundoora, Victoria has six scarred trees on their campus. They have developed a self-guided tour trail or information can be found on their website. ==See also== *Australian Aboriginal artefacts ==References== ==Further reading == * * ‚Äì Canoe tree at Currency Creek, South Australia * * ‚Äì Gallery of photos of scar trees in New South Wales *Scarred Trees: An Identification and recording manual Category:Australian Aboriginal bushcraft Category:History of Indigenous Australians ","title":"Scarred tree"},{"id":"3259347","text":"Herbert John Pither (1871 ‚Äì 29 April 1934) was a professional cyclist, engine manufacturer and aviation experimenter. ==Background== Pither was born in Reigate, Surrey, in 1871.

He came from the school of Andrea da Murano, and his works show the influence of Gentile da Fabriano. The earliest known date of a picture of his, an altarpiece in the Venetian academy, is 1440; the latest, in the Lateran museum, 1464, but he appears to have been alive in 1470. He worked in company with a certain \\"Joannes de Alemania\\", who has been (with considerable doubt) regarded as a brother (Giovanni of Murano), but no trace of this painter exists of a date later than 1447. After 1447 Antonio painted either alone or in combination with his younger brother Bartolomeo. The works of Antonio are well drawn for their epoch, with a certain noticeable degree of softness, and with good flesh and other tints. Three of his principal paintings are the Virgin Enthroned with the Four Doctors of the Church, the Coronation of the Virgin and SS Peter and Jerome. The first two (in which Giovanni cooperated) are in the Venetian Accademia, the third in the National Gallery, London. This gallery contains also specimens of the two following painters. *Bartolomeo Vivarini is known to have worked from 1450 to 1499. He learned oil painting from Antonello da Messina, and is said to have produced, in 1473, the first oil picture done in Venice. This is in the church of San Giovanni e Paolo, a large altarpiece in nine divisions, representing Augustine and other saints. Most of his works, however, including one in the National Gallery, are in tempera. His outline is always hard, and his color good; the figures have much dignified and devout expression. As vivarino means in Italian a goldfinch, he sometimes drew a goldfinch as the signature of his pictures. *Luigi or Alvise Vivarini, born c. 1446, painted from 1475 until his death in 1502. It has sometimes been supposed that, besides the Luigi who was the latest of this pictorial family, there had also been another Luigi who was the earliest, this supposition being founded on the fact that one picture is signed with the name, with the date 1414. There is good ground, however, for considering this date to be a forgery of a later time. The works of Luigi show an advance on those of his predecessors, and some of them are productions of high attainment; one of the best was executed for the Scuola di San Girolamo in Venice, representing the saint caressing his lion, and some monks decamping in terror. Other works by him are in Treviso and in Milan. He painted some remarkable portraits. Marco Basaiti was one of his pupils. ==Notes== Category:15th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Venetian painters ","title":"Vivarini"},{"id":"3259392","text":"Chersobius signatus is the world's smallest species of tortoise (family Testudinidae).

A member of the genus Chersobius, it is endemic to South Africa.Homopus Research Foundation web site (accessed August 24, 2013). ==Distribution and subspecies== C. signatus is naturally restricted to a small area in Little Namaqualand, an arid region in the west of South Africa, where it normally lives on rocky outcrops and forages among the rocks for the tiny succulent plants it eats. In the past, two subspecies were recognized, the Namaqualand speckled padloper (C. s. signatus) and the southern speckled padloper (C. s. cafer), but genetic studies have determined this was not supported and they are now considered a single species.Daniels SR, Hofmeyr MD, Henen BT, Baard EHW (2010). \\"Systematics and phylogeography of a threatened tortoise, the speckled padloper\\".

The males have a noticeably concave belly. This tiny tortoise can be distinguished from the other Chersobius species by its speckles, and by five toes on its fore feet (unlike many of its relatives, which have four toes on all four feet).Baard EHW (1994). Cape Tortoises: Their identification and care. Cape Nature Conservation. ==Life cycle and behaviour== Speckled padlopers are most active in the early morning (especially in autumn and spring, when they breed). Living among the rocky outcrops, they feed on small succulents which grow between the rocks, and which they are small enough to reach. Their courtship involves the male and female nodding their heads at each other. After mating, the female makes a nest of several eggs in damp soil between the rocks. The hatchlings are under 7 grams and long, and emerge after 100 to 120 days.Ranger S, du Plessis C (2010). Bergrivier Municipality Biodiversity Report 2010. LAB, IUCN. South Africa. p.32. ==Threats and conservation== C. signatus is threatened by traffic on roads, habitat destruction, and poaching for the pet trade. As the trade in collected Chersobius species is strictly illegal and any captive specimens are systematically registered in noncommercial studbooks in South Africa and Namibia, any commercial sale of Chersobius tortoises is almost without exception strictly illegal. Another threat comes from introduced species, such as domestic dogs and pigs. Many are taken from their natural habitat each year, and nearly all subsequently die as a result, as they do not readily adapt to typical captive diets and environmental change. Unlike most other Chersobius species, however, their diet (while very varied) is not highly specialized. Therefore, the species can adapt well to captivity, provided that proper attention is paid to temperature, humidity, and a sufficiently varied diet. They can be very hardy in captivity, and most problems with captive care are caused by faulty nutrition, high humidity, dampness, or bad husbandry.Corton, Misty.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 24, 1996. After accidentally breaking a stone gargoyle at a local house, Bart is forced to work there as punishment. He assumes it will be boring work, but is surprised when he learns that it is actually a burlesque house. Marge is horrified when she learns of the burlesque house, and resolves to have it shut down. The episode was directed by Dominic Polcino and written by Richard Appel. It won an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Music and Lyrics\\" for the song \\"We Put the Spring in Springfield\\". ==Plot== An oil tanker runs aground, spilling millions of gallons of oil on Baby Seal Beach. Lisa begs Marge to help celebrities scrub oil tar from shorebirds and sea mammals. Marge, Lisa and Maggie drive to the beach, leaving Bart and Homer home alone. Soon the house becomes a filthy mess, so Bart goes outside to play with his friends. Milhouse's toy airplane crashes atop the roof of a Gothic house. While Bart is retrieving it, he accidentally falls, destroying a stone gargoyle. Belle, the owner of the house, grabs Bart by the ear and takes him home, much to his friends' horror. At the Simpson home, Belle demands that Homer will punish him for trespassing her property. Belle sees that Homer is wearing a grocery bag. Homer balks until Belle threatens to come back and speak with Marge if he won't discipline Bart. Homer forces Bart to perform chores for Belle at the Maison Derri√®re, which the boy soon learns is a burlesque house. Bart does his job with enthusiasm and becomes indispensable to Belle. Marge and Lisa arrive at the beach but discover that cleaning beach tar from animals is a task reserved only for celebrities. Instead they are put to work scrubbing rocks, a job they soon abandon to return home. After Homer learns the truth about the burlesque house, he does nothing to stop Bart from working there. Principal Skinner visits the house and sees Bart is the door greeter. He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about Bart's workplace. As Homer crows that he has no problem with Bart working at a burlesque house, Marge returns home unexpectedly and is upset to learn this. Marge asks Belle to close the house, but Belle refuses, saying it is a part of Springfield. Marge presses the matter at a town meeting and shows slides of several prominent citizens leaving the Maison Derri√®re. Marge's campaign convinces the town to form a mob to destroy the house. The mob arrives at the house and starts smashing property. Homer tries to stop the mob's rampage by singing a musical number, accompanied by Belle and her burlesque dancers. The townfolk join in singing and are persuaded to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a bulldozer, having missed the song. As she starts a song about her stance on the house, she accidentally puts the bulldozer in drive and destroys a wing of the Maison. She apologizes profusely to Belle and the townsfolk for wrecking their beloved house. To pay for the damage, Marge performs a ventriloquist act at the house, where she is heckled by Homer ‚Äî who is promptly removed by the bouncer, Bart. ==Production== The episode was written by Richard Appel and directed by Dominic Polcino. Appel was looking for new locales to put Bart and thought it would be funny to have him work at a burlesque house. The problem was to find a way to put such a house in Springfield, which was solved with the bit with the toy airplane. There were a dozen different possible names for the burlesque house, some of which were raunchy. Josh Weinstein has said that there are so many sleazy characters in The Simpsons that it was easy to find people for the scenes in the burlesque house. A character modeled after John Swartzwelder can also be seen. Belle was not modeled after anyone in particular and she was redesigned several times. Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role. ==Cultural references== The episode's couch gag is a reference to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. A lot of the episode's plot is based on the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. The oil spill is a reference to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The Sea Captain is shown to be drunk at the helm, a reference to Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez who was accused of being intoxicated.

The band was struck by several tragedies, and Maclean eventually moved into production duties, utilizing his home studio in Providence (nicknamed \\"The Parlor\\"). Eventually James Murphy joined the band as sound engineer (where he became known for a punishing tour PA set up, which he nicknamed \\"Death From Above\\"). Eventually the band broke up, and Maclean spent several years out of the music business, getting a degree at the Providence College and teaching English in New Hampshire. He continued a friendship with Murphy, who moved to New York City and founded influential dance-punk label DFA Records and started LCD Soundsystem. Murphy urged Maclean to get back into music, and got Maclean experimenting with modern electronic mixing equipment; DFA would include several Maclean compositions on compilation records. His first album on the label, Less Than Human, was released in July 2005. Maclean toured America in 2006 in support of The DFA Remixes Chapter 2. On videos for \\"Give Me Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Tito's Way\\", MacLean was joined by tour drummer, the late Jerry Fuchs. Other touring members include Eric Broucek and Nicholas Millhiser, and \\"Dance With Me\\" features vocalist Nancy Whang of LCD Soundsystem. The video for \\"Give Me Every Little Thing\\" was directed by Ben Dickenson of Waverly Films. The video for \\"Tito's Way\\" was directed by Adam Levite as Associates in Science. In March 2008 The Juan MacLean released the single \\"Happy House\\". This was followed by a tour with Australian band Cut Copy and label-mates Shocking Pinks. This was followed by another single called \\"One Day\\" and the album The Future Will Come on April 14, 2009. \\"Happy House\\" was re-released in the summer of 2009. It was promoted with a video directed by The Wilderness featuring singer Nancy Whang and a collection of back-up dancers including members of other DFA bands. On November 8, 2009, the band's live drummer, Jerry Fuchs - who also drummed for Maserati and !!! died after falling down an elevator shaft. In 2010, Juan released a DJ-Kicks Mix CD on !K7 Records. In 2011 Juan Maclean began collaborating with singer Amy Douglas under the name Peach Melba. This new collaboration was for music considered \\"too 'housey' for proper Juan Maclean releases\\". The first single released was \\"Can't Let Go\\", which showed influences from classic Chicago house. In March 2013, The Juan MacLean released a new single called \\"You're My Destiny\\". On 25 June 2014 on Pitchfork Media, The Juan MacLean announced a new album, In a Dream, and its release date, 16 September 2014. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Less Than Human - 9 August 2005 *Visitations - 12 June 2006 (digital only remix album) *The Future Will Come - 20 April 2009 *DJ-Kicks - 2010 *Everybody Get Close - 2011 (digital only) *In a Dream - 16 September 2014 *The Brighter The Light - 20 September 2019 (compilation album) ===EPs=== * Der Half-Machine 10\\" - 2005 * Find A Way Tour EP - 2008 * Happy House Remixes - 2009 ===Singles=== * \\"By the Time I Get to Venus\\" - 2002 * \\"You Can't Have It Both Ways\\" - 2002 * \\"Give Me Every Little Thing\\" - 2003 (split with The Rapture's \\"Killing\\") * \\"Tito's Way\\" - 2005 * \\"Love Is in the Air\\" - 2006 * \\"Happy House\\" - 2008 * \\"The Simple Life\\" - 2008 * \\"One Day\\" - 2009 * \\"Feels So Good\\" - 2010 * \\"Can't Let Go\\" - 2011 (as Peach Melba) * \\"You're My Destiny\\" - 2013 * \\"Feel Like Movin'\\" - 2013 (split with Shit Robot featuring Reggie Watts' \\"We Got a Love\\") * \\"Get Down (with My Love)\\" - 2014 * \\"A Place Called Space\\" - 2014 * \\"A Simple Design\\" - 2014 * \\"Here I Am\\" - 2015 * \\"Can You Ever Really Know Somebody\\" - 2017 * \\"What Do You Feel Free About?\\" - 2018 * \\"Zone Non Linear\\" - 2019 ==References== ==External links== *The Juan MacLean's Official Site *The Juan MacLean at Discogs * *The Juan MacLean on The Belmont Sessions *The Juan MacLean's \\"Happy House\\" video on Vimeo * Category:American electronic musicians Category:DFA Records artists Category:Dance-punk musical groups Maclean, Juan ","title":"The Juan MacLean"},{"id":"3259434","text":"Venafrum was an ancient town of Molise, Italy, close to the boundaries of both Latium adiectum and Samnium. Its site is occupied by the modern Venafro, a village on the railway from Isernia to Vairano, 25 km southwest of the former, 201 m above sea-level. ==Overview== Venafrum was established as a civitas sine suffragio in 201 BC. Ancient authors tell us but little about it, except that it was one of those towns governed by a prefect sent yearly from Rome, and that in the Social War it was taken by the allies by treachery. Augustus founded a colony there and provided for the construction of an aqueduct (cf. the long decree relating to it in Corp. Inscr. Lat. x. No. 4842). It seems to have been a place of some importance. Its olive oil was the best in Italy, and Cato mentions its brickworks and iron manufactures. The original line of the Via Latina probably ran through Venafrum, making a detour, which the later road seems to have avoided. Rufrae was probably dependent on it. Roads also ran from Venafrum to Isernia and to Telesia by way of Allifae. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Roman towns and cities in Italy Category:Former populated places in Italy Category:Archaeological sites in Molise es:Venafrum ","title":"Venafrum"},{"id":"3259437","text":"Megatech Software was the first licensor of anime games in the United States, and the first licensor of hentai games or eroge in English. ==History== Very little is known about Megatech as a company.

She was probably a nun. There are a number of hands discernible in the manuscripts. The chief scribe was a priest called Senior. Historians have also attributed elements of the manuscripts to Emetrius, whose style is attributable in comparison to an earlier signed work. However, based on painting style attributes, some theorists conclude that nearly all of the manuscript illustrations were completed by Ende. Ende worked on a 10th-century group of manuscripts, of which there are 26 known copies with illustrations, however only Beatus of Girona contains the work of a woman . These manuscripts contain the Commentary on the Apocalypse compiled by the Spanish monk Beatus of Li√©bana in 786. The manuscripts were created in the monastery of Tabara in the mountains of Leon in northwest Spain. The illuminations illustrate the Apocalyptic Vision of St. John the Divine in the Book of Revelation in the Mozarabic style. This style developed in Spain after the Muslim invasions, blending elements of Islamic art and decorative traditions, particularly the emphasis on geometry, rich colors, ornamented grounds, and stylized figures. ==References== ==Further reading== *Chadwick, Whitney, Women, Art, and Society, Thames and Hudson, London, 1990 *Harris, Anne Sutherland and Linda Nochlin, Women Artists: 1550-1950, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Knopf, New York, 1976 Category:Manuscript illuminators Category:Spanish women artists Category:10th-century artists Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:10th-century Spanish artists Category:10th-century Spanish women Category:Medieval women artists Category:10th-century people from the Kingdom of Le√≥n Category:Medieval Spanish women artists ","title":"Ende (artist)"},{"id":"3259443","text":"Edward Bianchi (born April 24, 1942) is an American television director and producer.

It is in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Alternate titles include Martha Reproving Mary, The Conversion of the Magdalene, and the Alzaga Caravaggio. ==History== Caravaggio's Martha and Mary is dated to 1598‚Äì99, when he was in the entourage of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. Little is known of its history between those years and 25 June 1971, when its owners attempted to sell it at Christie's in London (lot 21). It remained unsold at 130,000 guineas, despite the confidence of the restorer Juan Corradini of Buenos Aires. Later converts were Benedict Nicolson and Mina Gregori (as late as January 1974). Today it is generally considered an autograph work. It was acquired by the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1973. It is thought that the painting was originally in the collection of Caravaggio's patron Ottavio Costa. His will of 6 August 1606, contains a painting by this description and states that Riggerio Tritonio, secretary of Cardinal Montalto, is to choose between the Martha and Mary and a Saint Francis; the painting not selected was to go to Costa's friend and colleague Giovanni Enriquez de Herrera. Since the Saint Francis later appears in the inventory of Tritinio, it has been assumed that the Martha and Mary passed to Herrera, probably in late 1606. Giovanni Enriquez de Herrera died on 1 March 1610, without a will, thus leaving his four sons to decide on the fate of his possessions. It has been speculated that it remained in Rome until the 1620s, but the only firm evidence for its provenance after the Herrera family is a seal and inscriptions on the back of the original canvas with the names Niccol√≤ Panzani, Emilia Panzani and Anna E. Panzani. This family has not been traced. Since its rediscovery, its influence has become apparent, most notably in the number of copies, a now lost work by Carlo Saraceni and a well known version by Orazio Gentileschi, today in Munich. ==Composition== The painting shows the sisters Martha and Mary from the New Testament. Martha is in the act of converting Mary from her life of pleasure to the life of virtue in Christ. Martha, her face shadowed, leans forward, passionately arguing with Mary, who twirls an orange blossom between her fingers as she holds a mirror, symbolising the vanity she is about to give up. The power of the image lies in Mary's face, caught at the moment when conversion begins. Martha and Mary was painted while Caravaggio was living in the palazzo of his patron, Cardinal Del Monte. His paintings for Del Monte fall into two groups: the secular genre pieces such as The Musicians, The Lute Player, and Bacchus - all featuring boys and youths in somewhat claustophobic interior scenes - and religious images such as Rest on the Flight into Egypt and Ecstasy of Saint Francis. Among the religious paintings was a group of four works featuring the same two female models, together or singly. The models were two well-known courtesans who frequented the palazzi of Del Monte and other wealthy and powerful art patrons, and their names were Anna Bianchini and Fillide Melandroni. Anna Bianchini appeared first as a solitary Mary Magdalene in the Penitent Magdalene of about 1597. Fillide Melandroni appeared in a secular Portrait of a Courtesan done the same year for Del Monte's friend and fellow art-lover, the banker Vincenzo Giustiniani. In 1598 Caravaggio painted Fillide again as Saint Catherine, capturing a beauty full of intelligence and spirit. In Martha and Mary the two are shown together, Fillide perfectly fitted to the role of Mary, Anna to the mousier but insistent presence as Martha. A finely grained cream-brown table running in front of the sisters displays three objects, of which a Venetian mirror is the most obvious. It reflects the Magdalen's hand and a rectangular window, to which reflection her middle finger points. The other two objects are an ivory comb and a dish with a sponge. The type of dish was called a sponzarol by the Venetians and, in this case, is made of alabaster. Mary wears red, the colour of the Magdalen, and a dress very similar to one Caravaggio employs in his Portrait of a Courtesan (1597) and Saint Catherine (1598), with embroidery on the blouse, similar to what we see in his Penitent Magdalen. ==Interpretation== The writings of the Church Fathers (starting with Origen) established Martha and Mary as representative of the active versus the contemplative aspects of Christian faith. This distinction was exemplified in art like Bernardino Luini's Martha and Mary, once in the Barberini Collection in Rome, and attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. Caravaggio would certainly have known the painting. ==Technical investigation== The painting was cleaned and investigated by the scientists at the Detroit Institute of Arts.James L. Greaves and Meryl Johnson, New Findings on Caravaggio‚Äôs Technique in the Detroit ‚ÄòMagdalen‚Äò, The Burlington Magazine Vol. 116, No. 859, Special Issue Devoted to Caravaggio and the Caravaggesques (Oct., 1974), pp. 564+566-572+591 The pigment analysis revealed the usual pigments of the Baroque period such as lead white, red and yellow ochre and azurite.Caravaggio, Martha and Mary Magdalene, illustrated pigment analysis at ColourLex ==Referenced works== File:Portrait of a Courtesan by Caravaggio.jpgPortrait of a Courtesan (Fillide Melandroni), destroyed File:Michelangelo Caravaggio 060.jpgSaint Catherine of Alexandria, Thyssen- Bornemisza Museum File:Michelangelo Caravaggio 063.jpgPenitent Magdalene, Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome File:Portrait d'une Femme √† sa Toilette, by Titian, from C2RMF retouched.jpgTitian, Woman at her toilet (ca. 1515), Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris File:Conversion of the Magdalen by Luini.jpgBernardino Luini, Martha and Mary (ca. 1520), San Diego Museum of Art, California File:Martha reproving her sister Mary by Orazio Gentileschi (1620) - Alte Pinakothek - Munich - Germany 2017.jpgOrazio Gentileschi, Martha and Mary (ca. 1620), Alte Pinakothek, Munich ==References== Category:1590s paintings Category:Paintings by Caravaggio Category:Paintings depicting Mary Magdalene ","title":"Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)"},{"id":"3259478","text":"The name Maring has been used in the Philippines by PAGASA in the Western Pacific. * Tropical Depression Maring (1964) * Typhoon Della (1968) (T6816, 20W, Maring) ‚Äì struck Japan. * Typhoon Betty (1972) (T7214, 14W, Maring) ‚Äì approached Taiwan and struck China. * Typhoon Anita (1976) (T7612, 12W, Maring) * Tropical Depression Maring (1980) * Tropical Storm June (1984) (T8412, 14W, Maring) ‚Äì struck the Philippines and China. * Tropical Storm Kit (1988) (T8821, 17W, Maring) * Typhoon Sally (1996) (T9616, 23W, Maring) * Typhoon Wukong (2000) (T0016, 23W, Maring) ‚Äì struck Vietnam. * Typhoon Haiyan (2001) (T0121, 25W, Maring) ‚Äì a storm that was 90 knots at its peak but caused little or no damage. * Typhoon Longwang (2005) (T0519, 19W, Maring) ‚Äì a storm that triggered mudslides killing 95 in eastern China. * Tropical Storm Mujigae (2009) (T0913, 14W, Maring) * Severe Tropical Storm Trami (2013) (T1312, 12W, Maring) ‚Äì caused flooding in the Philippines. * Typhoon Doksuri (2017) (T1719, 21W, Maring) Category:Pacific typhoon disambiguation pages ","title":"Typhoon Maring"},{"id":"3259482","text":"Yuyan (1918-1997), courtesy name Yanrui, nickname Xiaoruizi, was a Chinese calligrapher of Manchu descent. He was a member of the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty. He claimed that he was appointed by Puyi, the last Emperor of China, as the heir to the throne. His claim is the subject of the travel adventure book The Empty Throne by British journalist Tony Scotland.Scotland, Tony, and Patrick Leigh Fermor, The Empty Throne: Quest for an Imperial Heir in the People's Republic of China, (1993). ==Early life== Born in Wangfujing, Beijing, Yuyan was the second son of Pucheng (Ê∫•ÂÅÅ) and Jinggui (Êï¨Ë≤¥), a lady of the Fuca (ÂØåÂØü) clan. His grandfather was Zailian (ËºâÊøÇ; 1854‚Äì1917), a son of Yicong (1831‚Äì1889), the fifth son of the Daoguang Emperor. He was a distant cousin of Puyi, the Last Emperor. In 1936, Yuyan was summoned by Puyi, who had been enthroned as the ruler of the puppet state Manchukuo in 1934 by the Empire of Japan, to join his imperial court in Changchun, Jilin. Yuyan was very close to Puyi, who called him \\"Xiaoruizi\\" (Â∞èÁëûÂ≠ê; or \\"Little Rui\\"). ==Life in the People's Republic of China== After the fall of Manchukuo, Yuyan was arrested by the Russians and imprisoned from 1945 to 1950 near Khabarovsk in the Soviet Union's Far East Region along with Puyi. He was later sent back to China, where he was incarcerated in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre in Liaoning from 1950 to 1957. Yuyan was a pretender to the Chinese throne. He claimed that Puyi appointed him as heir when they were both imprisoned in Russia in 1950. In his autobiography, Puyi wrote only that he considered selecting Yuyan as his heir.Henry Pu Yi, Paul Kramer, The Last Manchu: The Autobiography of Henry Pu Yi, Last Emperor of China, p. 244. Under a succession law adopted in 1937, Puyi's younger brother, Pujie, became next in line in succession to the throne. Following his release from Fushun, Yuyan worked as a Chinese language teacher, and later in a haberdashery factory. He was arrested in 1959 and sent for hard labour at a public security detention centre near Beijing. Yuyan was arrested again in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution and sent to do hard labour in Shanxi. He was only released in 1979 and allowed to return to Beijing, where he became a road sweeper. ==After release from prison== Yuyan was a calligrapher and poet.

He won the award for the Most Outstanding Canadian in the CFL two years in a row in 2002 and 2003. At the time of his retirement after the 2010 season, Cahoon ranked sixth overall in career receiving yards with 13,301 yards and the all-time leader overall in pass receptions with 1,017. He is also the all-time leading receiver in Grey Cup history with 46 receptions and 658 receiving yards. ==Honors== *Grey Cup Most Outstanding Canadian: 2003, 2009 *CFL Most Outstanding Canadian: 2002, 2003 *East Division Most Outstanding Canadian: 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009 *Alouettes' Most Outstanding Player: 2006, 2007 *Alouettes' Most Outstanding Canadian: 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 *CFL All-Star: 1999, 2004, 2008 *East Division All-Star: 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 *CFLPA All-Star: 2002 *CFLPA East Division All-Star: 1999,2000,2001,2002 2003, 2004, 2005 *No. 86 retired by Montreal Alouettes: July 29, 2016 Cahoon had caught at least one pass in 202 of his last 203 games and at least one pass in each of his last 144 games. ==Early years== Cahoon spent part of his childhood in Cardston, Alberta, and is therefore considered a non-import under the CFL's import/non-import ratio rule. Cahoon was born in Utah but qualified as a Canadian in the CFL because his parents were Canadian and he spent time as a youth in Alberta. Throughout his career Cahoon steadfastly maintained he felt he was Canadian despite being born in the U.S. and attending both high school and college in Utah. Cahoon played his high school sports at Mountain View High School in Orem, Utah, where he earned All-Region and All-State honors in football, basketball, and soccer. He was named Mountain View's Athlete of the Year in 1990. ==College career== Cahoon played two seasons (1993‚Äì94) at Ricks College, now known as Brigham Young University‚ÄìIdaho, in Rexburg, Idaho. He set school records for most receptions and most receiving yards in a single season and in a career. In 1994, he ranked second in the nation in receiving and was named Junior College All-American. He transferred to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. He played in every game for the Cougars in 1996, when BYU became the first Division I-A team in NCAA history to win 14 games in a single season. In his senior year (1997), Cahoon became BYU's top receiver with 84 catches. He averaged 84.6 receiving yards per game during that season including an 8-catch, 217-yard performance in the Cougars' 13‚Äì10 win at Arizona State University. ==Professional career== ===Montreal Alouettes=== He was drafted by the Montreal Alouettes in the first round (sixth overall) in the 1998 CFL Draft. He won the 90th Grey Cup, 97th Grey Cup and 98th Grey Cup with Montreal in 2002, 2009 and 2010. He was named Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian in both 2002 and 2009. His number with the Montreal Alouettes is 86. His jersey was retired on July 29, 2016 at Percival Molson Stadium in Montr√©al. In 2004, Cahoon was part of a CFL precedent with four receivers on one team reaching the 1000-yard mark in one season: Cahoon with 1183 yards, Jeremaine Copeland with 1154 yards, Thyron Anderson with 1147 yards, and Kwame Cavil with 1090 yards. The 2005 Montreal Alouettes would repeat this feat, with Cahoon the only player repeating: the four receivers consisted of Kerry Watkins (1364 yards), Terry Vaughn (1113 yards), Cahoon (1067 yards), and Dave Stala (1037 yards). On August 2, 2007, Cahoon kicked a game winning 22-yard field goal in overtime in a 30‚Äì27 victory over the Toronto Argonauts. He replaced Damon Duval, who had been ejected from the game. Ben Cahoon stands only 5'9, but is able to bench press 225 lbs 19 times. He is also considered to be one of the greatest slotbacks ever, and was nominated with Anthony Calvillo for the CFL Greatest QB-WR Combo of All Time. He was named an East Division All-Star in 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. He has also been named a CFL All Star on numerous occasions. In 2008, Cahoon broke Peter Dalla Riva's record for most touchdowns ever by an Alouette receiver. He has had nine 1,000 yard receiving seasons, including a streak of eight straight. On December 15, 2008, Cahoon re-signed with the Alouettes, where the deal called for a one-year contract with an option. This enabled him to play his 12th CFL season, all of them with the Montreal Alouettes. On May 14, 2010 Cahoon confirmed his return for the 2010 season. On October 11, 2010, in a home game against the Calgary Stampeders, Cahoon became the CFL's all- time reception leader, catching his 1,007th career pass from Anthony Calvillo in the 4th quarter. The previous record of 1,006 was held by Terry Vaughn. On January 26, 2011, Cahoon announced his retirement. In 2014, Cahoon was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. On July 29, 2016, his number 86 was retired by the Montreal Alouettes in a ceremony during half-time of their game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. ===Coaching career=== On February 1, 2011, Brigham Young University head football coach, Bronco Mendenhall, announced Ben Cahoon would join the BYU coaching staff as the wide receivers coach. He served in that role through the end of the 2012 season, after which the school re-hired its former offensive coordinator Robert Anae, leading to Cahoon being released on January 15, 2013. Cahoon returned to the coaching staff for the 2016 season under new head coach Kalani Sitake and offensive coordinator Ty Detmer for 2 seasons. ==Statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:65%; text-align:center;\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Receiving ! rowspan=\\"99\\" fff;\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" fff;\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on May 16, 1996. ==Plot== Joey is up for a role in a movie directed by Warren Beatty. The role calls for him to kiss another man ‚Äì something Joey has trouble doing. At first he asks the girls to kiss him and let him know if he is really a bad kisser; Phoebe agrees on grounds that she had already kissed Joey once before. Phoebe judges that Joey has a firm and tender kiss and she would recommend him to a friend. Monica suggests that Joey has a problem kissing men, and which makes him very uncomfortable. He tries to get Ross and Chandler to help him, but with little success. Ross finally relents and surprises Joey with a kiss. Joey then reveals that they had already picked someone else for the role but thanks Ross for helping out. Rachel reluctantly agrees to be maid of honor at her ex-fianc√© Barry's wedding, but inadvertently steals the couple's thunder when she walks up the aisle with her butt showing. She is even angrier to find out that when she dumped Barry at the altar, his parents told everyone that she ran away because she was insane because she had syphilis. Rachel is about to leave, but stops when she learns that Barry was betting on her to leave before 9:45. She tells Barry that she promised herself she would make it through at least one of his weddings. She then sings \\"Copacabana\\" at the wedding, a song she was unable to perform at high school. Monica is anxious to find out what the future has in store for her and Richard. They talk, and realise they want different things in life. Monica wants to have children of her own, but Richard does not want to have any more kids. Later, Richard says he will have kids with her if that is what Monica wants, but she tells him that she cannot have kids with someone who does not really want them, and they reluctantly agree to break up. Chandler has met a woman online ‚Äì they chat late into the night. Things go well until she reveals that she is married and that her husband is cheating on her. At Phoebe's urging, Chandler decides to look past that. They agree to meet in person at Central Perk ‚Äì and his online girlfriend turns out to be Janice. The two immediately get back together, much to the others' chagrin. ==Production== The sub-plot where Joey has to kiss a man was originally intended to be a story about Joey auditioning for the role of an uncircumcised man. The rest of the group then came up with various ways of making him look the part. The story was changed on the advice of network censors, who thought it was tasteless but it was later used in \\"The One with Ross and Monica's Cousin\\".Sangster, J; Bailey, D. Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to \\"Friends\\", Virgin Books, (2000), ==Reception== In the original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 29.0 million viewers.

Born in Stratford, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Thomas Mayne Daly (1827-1885) and Helen McLaren (Ferguson) Daly, his father was a member of the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Perth North. His grandfather, John Corry Wilson Daly, was the first mayor of Stratford. He was educated as a lawyer and was called to the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1876. He practised law in Stratford until 1881. In 1881, he moved to Brandon, Manitoba and practised law in partnership with George Robson Coldwell. In 1882, he was elected the first mayor of Brandon. During his first six-month term, Daly initiated a civic development program which allowed for raising $150 000 through debentures. He resigned as Mayor in December 1882. In 1884 he was re-elected as the Mayor of Brandon. In 1887, Daly was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Selkirk as a Liberal-Conservative. He was reelected in 1891. He did not run in 1896. He was defeated in 1908. He was created a QC by the Governor General Lord Stanley in 1890. From 1892 to 1896, he was the Minister of the Interior and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, in the cabinet of Sir John Abbott, becoming the first federal Cabinet Minister from Manitoba. In 1896, he was Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada (Acting) and Secretary of State of Canada (Acting). In 1903, he was appointed Police Magistrate of Winnipeg and in 1909 was appointed a Judge of the first Juvenile Court in Canada. A well-known tale recounts how Calgary lawyer Paddy Nolan's physical resemblance to Daly often led to the two being confused for each other. Once, after Daly had jokingly angered a legal client of Nolan's by impersonating the lawyer, Nolan got his revenge by refusing to grant a patent to a prospective homesteader, insisting that the Ministry of the Interior would require a bribe in order to look at his file - leading to Daly sending Nolan a note several days later about the \\"bad name\\" that the Ministry was getting due to his hijinx.Roy St. George Stubbs, Lawyers and Laymen of Western Canada. Toronto, 1939, pp. 171-2. The Rural Municipality of Daly was named for him. ==Museum== The Daly House Museum in Brandon, Manitoba, is located in Thomas Mayne Daly's Brandon home, which was built in 1892. The museum now contains four floors of artifacts and archival materials representative of Brandon's early history. == Archives == There is a Thomas Mayne Daly fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

Coffey graduated from Fordham University in 1910. While still in college, he was signed by the Doves and played 73 games; it was very common in those days for college players to play in the major leagues as well. He then spent most of the next 16 years in the minors, seeing his only other major-league action in 1918. He started that season playing 22 games with the Tigers before being sold to the Red Sox in mid-August. He was listed as a possible replacement for the injured Dave Shean, but never got a chance to play in the World Series. Coffey is the only player to play with both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth in the same season (1918 Tigers and Red Sox). In two seasons, he played in 110 games and had 368 at bats with 33 runs, 69 hits, 5 doubles, 6 triples, 1 home run, 26 RBI, 6 stolen bases, 22 walks, a .188 batting average, .241 on-base percentage and a .242 slugging percentage. While still actively playing, he became the part-time coach at his alma mater, holding that post until 1918. He returned in 1922 as the school's first full-time coach and remained there until 1958 (Fordham didn't field a team in 1944), amassing 1160 wins. The University's baseball field is named in his honor. From 1926 to 1958, he also served as athletic director.

Pankratz and Peter Pankratz who escaped Communist Russia, then testified to the plight of their fellow believers after safely reaching the USA, where they formed a band at Liberty University in VA. At first, the band released two albums under the name \\"The Russians\\" (The Russians, I Want To Talk To You & Love Forever More). The band underwent a name change for the third album called \\"Ruscha\\" in 1987 and released Come Alive in 1988. The album included songs such as \\"Come Home\\", \\"Come Alive\\", \\"The Word Stands Forever\\" and several other which charted on the Christian radio stations in the US in 1988.Entry in Mark Allen Powell's Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music (Hendrickson Publishers, 2002), p. 784. The original album has been out of print, but a CD was re-issued in 1996 on an import label (Victor Entertainment, Inc. in Tokyo, Japan) and later in 2012 by Nikolai R. Pankratz. These newer versions didn't have the printed lyrics the US original version had, but does have all the same songs in English and cover art. Their fourth album was \\"Ruscha\\" Invisible Hands in 1992. This album was very rare because it was entirely sung in Russian. In 2012 Nikolai R. Pankratz turned back the clock and released 5 more Cds called \\"The Russian Classics\\" reaching back into the 70s when Nikolai and Pater first left the Soviet Union. These were the earliest and first ever gospel recordings made in the Russian language for the Russian speaking community living behind the iron curtain. The songs were aired by way of short wave radio into Russia through organizations such as (RCR), Alex Leonovich (SMS), Peter Deyneka (SGA), BBC, Voice of America and many others and became popular among the Slavic people. The songs are in the Russian hymnals and until this day are sung, recorded and re-recorded by many. Three of the members of Ruscha (Andy Denton, Mike Jacobs, & Billy Williams) went on to form Legend Seven in 1990 by Word Records. Andy Denton created the two solo albums Midnight Of Hope in 1999 by KMG Records (Nashville, TN), and 50 Years From Now.

At times its shifting lineup has included Steve Hackett of Genesis, Bill Bruford of King Crimson and Yes, Ron Jarzombek from Watchtower and Spastic Ink as well as Jim Matheos of Fates Warning, several of Malone's former bandmates from Cynic and John Myung from Dream Theater. ==Musical style== The music of Gordian Knot is a stylistic mixture of progressive rock and metal, instrumental music reminiscent of Robert Fripp's Guitar Craft and his solo work (e.g. compare Gordian Knot's song \\"Grace\\" with Robert Fripp's \\"Evening Star\\"). Notable is their use of counterpoint, often presenting several complex intertwining layers of melodic, harmonic and rhythmic structures. The music of Gordian Knot also relies heavily on diatonic guitar melodies although sometimes encompassing later resolved dissonances to add a jazz fusion-like flavor. The interaction between the various instruments, all played by accomplished instrumentalists, allows for communication of various melodic lines, harmonies and rhythms among guitar(s), bass and (concerning rhythms) even drums. Also, Gordian Knot cannot be categorized without disregarding certain aspects of their music. For example, the piece \\"Komm, s√ºsser Tod, komm sel'ge\\" is a transcription of a piece of the same name by Johann Sebastian Bach, while some of their other pieces, most notably \\"Grace\\", have a distinct classical, even baroque Bach-like flavor, being constructed in an almost counterpoint-like fashion by interweaving several independent diatonic melodic lines from the Chapman Stick. Other songs, such as \\"Muttersprache\\" (German for \\"mother tongue\\") or \\"Code/Anticode\\" work with on-beat/off-beat, interplay between two guitars and/or the rhythm and melody section, incorporating jazz chords and dissonant intervals to create tension and form the basis for a mixture of jazz fusion and progressive rock/metal. ==Band members== Malone recruits a different line-up each time when he is recording and playing live with Gordian Knot. ===Current members=== * Sean Malone - bass, fretless bass, sticks, guitars, keyboards, e-bow, echoplex, loops, occasional vocals. ===Past members=== ====Studio members==== *Sonia Lynn - vocals *Paul Masvidal - guitar *Bob Brunin - guitars *Jason G√∂bel - guitars *Glenn Snelwar - guitars, mandolins *Ron Jarzombek - guitars *Steve Hackett - guitars *Adam Levy - guitars *Jim Matheos - acoustic guitars *Trey Gunn - warr guitar *John Myung - chapman stick *Bill Bruford - drums *Sean Reinert - drums ==Discography== *Gordian Knot (1999) *Emergent (2003) == References == ==External links== *[ Sean Malone / Gordian Knot official website] * Interview with Bill Bruford Category:American progressive metal musical groups Category:American progressive rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1998 ","title":"Gordian Knot (band)"},{"id":"3259508","text":"Dimitar Dushkov Penev (, born 12 July 1945) is a Bulgarian football coach and former player and central defender of CSKA Sofia.

The land was donated to Warrington Borough council in 1995. It was designated in November 2005. The site comprises almost 30 hectares of meadow grassland occupying the area to the south of Manchester Road (the A57) and to the north of the Mersey. It is five minutes by car from Warrington town centre. There is ongoing active management of the hedgerows which include thinning and laying of the various edges. Hawthorns also grow in an orchard area rather than the more useful hedge arrangement. There are various paths around the perimeter and crossing the meadows that are open and closed at various times dependent on conservation projects. On occasion the members of the Warrington rowing club can be seen using the Mersey. Rare breed longhorn Cattle are grazed on the site during the summer months and they play a vital role in keeping the grass short, which in turn encourages ground nesting birds such as skylark. A wild flower meadow has been created on one of the fields. The site attracts flocks of fieldfares and redwings, which feed on the berries of some of the oldest hawthorn hedges in the Cheshire area. A major project was started in 2009 to clean up the Woolston new cut canal that runs along the northern edge of the meadows. Invasive flora is being cut back and long-term projects are attempting to remove pollution and toxicants from the silt in the canal. ==References== ==External links== *Warrington Council website Category:Local Nature Reserves in Cheshire Category:Tourist attractions in Cheshire ","title":"Paddington Meadows"},{"id":"3259539","text":"Siliquae of Cardamine impatiens A silique or siliqua (plural siliques or siliquae) is a type of fruit (seed capsule) having two fused carpels with the length being more than three times the width.

It is a seedling of 'Surprise', another pink-fleshed apple that is believed to be a descendant of Malus niedzwetskyana. ==History== In 1940, after many years of work on breeding red- fleshed apples, Etter set up a partnership with George Roeding Jr.'s California Nursery Company, one of the goals of which was to introduce some of Etter's Surprise-derived cultivars to the public. Eventually Roeding settled on test seedling #39, which apparently impressed him with its looks (translucent skin, medium size, and tapered shape), its tart-sweet flavor, and its late-summer ripening date. He secured U.S. plant patent 723 for it on Etter's behalf, named it 'Pink Pearl', and featured it in his 1945 catalog. 'Pink Pearl' apples are generally medium-sized, with a conical shape. They are named for the color of their flesh, which is a bright rosy pink sometimes streaked or mottled with white. They have a translucent, yellow-green skin, and a crisp, juicy flesh with tart to sweet-tart taste. 'Pink Pearl' apples ripen in late August to mid-September. It is susceptible to apple scab, and the fruit tend not to keep well on the tree once ripe. Among Pink Pearl's descendants is 'Pink Princess', a carmine-striped apple with pink to dark pink flesh. It was originally named 'Pink Lady' by its developer, Fred Jansen of Ontario, Canada, but Jansen did not patent the name and it was subsequently taken over for a quite different Australian apple, forcing Jansen to change the name of his own apple. ==References== ==External links== *Tasting notes, with blossom picture Category:Apple cultivars ","title":"Pink Pearl (apple)"},{"id":"3259568","text":"The Man on the Balcony is a mystery novel by Swedish writer Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂, originally published as Mannen p√• balkongen in 1967. It is the third novel in the detective series revolving around Swedish police detective Martin Beck. In the novel, Martin Beck and his team realize that a paedophilic murderer may have been seen by an unidentified serial robber who was watching for prey in the area, at the time. The pressure is turned up when more child murders begin to occur. == Plot summary == At the beginning of the book Beck goes to a peaceful mission with colleague Ahlberg in Motala. His colleagues are meanwhile looking for a handbag robber who makes the Stockholm parks unsafe. In the same park, which hosted his last robbery, a child's body is discovered soon after by two tramps. The 9-year-old girl has been abused and strangled. Shortly thereafter, another child befalls the same fate. As Beck returns, the machinery of the police investigation is already running. The police are initially lacking any clues as the abduction of the second girl was only viewed by a three-year-old boy. Only an elderly exhibitionist is briefly detained, but has nothing to do with the murders. Only a coincidence brings the investigation continues: Gunvald Larsson, who first appears in this novel, has telephoned at the very beginning of the investigation with an elderly lady who complained about a man in an opposite flat, standing all day on his balcony and looking at the road and playing with the children, among others. After Martin Beck recalled this call; with difficulty the note written by Larsson is found and by a mixture of obstinate investigating and the coincidence that the caller had the uncommon name Andersson is the killer found, just before he can attack a child again. == Characters == The boorish detective Gunvald Larsson is introduced, as is Einar R√∂nn, who comes from a rural part of the country and likes his life quiet. Larsson was Sj√∂wall's favourite character, whereas R√∂nn was Wahl√∂√∂'s. Also, two regular street cops are introduced, Kristiansson and Kvant, who will provide some of the comic relief throughout the rest of the series. == Film adaptation == On 26 November 1993 the film with the same name premiered in Sweden. The film starred G√∂sta Ekman as Martin Beck and Rolf Lassg√•rd as Gunvald Larsson. It was a great success and won the Swedish Guldbagge Award for Best Actor (G√∂sta Ekman), Best Screenplay (Daniel Alfredson & Jonas Cornell) and Best Film (Hans L√∂nnerheden, producer).

The ferry is operated year- round by the Delaware Department of Transportation. It is closed on national holidays of Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Year's Day, and also as required by weather. ==History== The ferry is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, ferries in continuous operation in the United States. In addition to its longevity, the ferry is of historical importance as one of the locations where slave runner Patty Cannon embarked with kidnapped refugee slaves and free blacks. She shipped them to Georgia where the free blacks were sold into slavery and refugee slaves returned to servitude. The Ferry was established in the 1740s by James Cannon, and operated by his son Jacob after his death. After Jacob's death in 1793, his widow petitioned the Delaware General Assembly for exclusive rights to operate a ferry service across the river. The ferry was privately operated by the Cannon family until the mid-19th century, when the General Assembly authorized the county to operate a free ferry at the location of \\"Cannon's Ferry\\". In 1935, the Delaware Department of Transportation assumed responsibility for the operation of the ferry and has continued to operate it into the 21st century. ==National Register of Historic Places listing== Cannon's Ferry is a historic home and cable ferry added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Cannon Hall was built about 1810, and is a two-story, five bay, single-pile frame dwelling in the Georgian style. It has a small frame wing attached to the west end of the main house. It has a central hall plan and interior end chimneys. The property also includes the ferry landing site. At least since 1793, and perhaps longer, a public ferry has crossed the river here. It is the last cable ferry in Delaware. and 'Delaware Public Archives: Cannon's Ferry ==Woodland Ferry vessel, the Tina Fallon== The 65-foot-long Tina Fallon was put into service in 2007, replacing the 65-foot-long Virginia C.

The Tina Fallon was constructed by Chesapeake Shipbuilding of Salisbury, Maryland at a cost of $931,000 and can carry six vehicles at a time. The site work was completed by George and Lynch of New Castle, Delaware. The total cost for the project was approximately 3.2 million dollars, including the $931,000 for the ferry, $1.8 million for new docks and $500,000 for permits, security cameras and lighting.

They play in the New York‚ÄìPenn League and are the Class A Short Season affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. The Spikes play their home games at Medlar Field at Lubrano Park on the campus of the Pennsylvania State University. The team was founded in 1958 in Auburn, New York as an affiliate of the New York Yankees. Through its first two decades, the team's affiliation passed through the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins and Philadelphia Phillies. In 1978, however, the team was left without a parent club. Auburn fielded independent teams in the New York-Penn League‚Äîwith new nicknames each year‚Äîuntil 1980. Erie-area businessmen Dave Masi and Joe Castelli propped up the franchise for the 1980 season, then moved it to Erie, as the Erie Cardinals, reflecting the new affiliation with the St. Louis Cardinals. That affiliation lasted for 25 years, with three further relocations‚Äîto Hamilton, Ontario as the Hamilton Redbirds, Glens Falls, New York as the Glens Falls Redbirds and to Augusta, New Jersey as the New Jersey Cardinals. The team settled in its current location in the State College area in 2006 and became known as the \\"State College Spikes\\". After one season with the Cardinals in State College, the Spikes ended their affiliation and became the new Class A-Short Season affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, starting in 2007 and ending in 2012. The Spikes, once again, switched affiliations back to the Cardinals for the 2013 season. ==History== ===Stability, then instability in Auburn (1958‚Äì1980)=== The State College Spikes were founded in 1958 in Auburn, New York as the Auburn Yankees. The team played its home games at Falcon Park in Auburn from 1958‚Äì1980. For two decades, affiliated baseball was a mainstay in Auburn. After the Yankees, the Mets, Twins and Phillies all had affiliation agreements with the team. In 1978, however, the team did not have an agreement in place. Auburn fielded an independent team known as the Auburn Sunsets. Unaffiliated baseball remained in Auburn for the following two seasons, as well. The team changed its name to the Auburn Red Stars in 1979 and Auburn Americans in 1980. Erie-area businessmen Dave Masi and Joe Castelli propped up the Americans, then reached an affiliation agreement with the St. Louis Cardinals during baseball's winter meetings. They moved the team to Erie for the 1981 season. ===Playing in Erie (1981‚Äì1987)=== The new Erie Cardinals played their home games at Ainsworth Field from 1981 to 1987. The team relocated to Hamilton, Ontario after the 1987 season and were replaced by the relocation of the Newark Orioles to Erie to become the Erie Orioles (now Hudson Valley Renegades) who played in the same league for the 1988 season. ===Playing in Hamilton (1988‚Äì1992)=== The team was purchased by Albany businessman Joe Vellano and the team relocated to Bernie Arbour Memorial Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario, to become the Hamilton Redbirds. The team maintained its affiliation with the Cardinals and played in Hamilton from 1988 to 1992. In 1991, Vellano sold the Redbirds to a limited partnership headed by Barry Gordon and Marc Klee. Gordon and Klee planned to relocate the team to New Jersey where partner Rob Hillard was heading up management of a new stadium. The team spent a lame duck 1991 season in Hamilton, but in 1992, the team set the all-time record for winning percentage by a St. Louis Cardinals minor league team at .651, with a record of 56‚Äì20. ===Playing in Glens Falls (1993)=== The team relocated again to Glens Falls, New York, to become the Glens Falls Redbirds. The team still maintained its affiliation with the Cardinals. This relocation was only interim as the team played at East Field for the 1993 season only while the team was waiting for their new stadium in Sussex County, New Jersey to be completed. The team's relocation to Glens Falls welcomed back professional baseball in five years. The team that previously played in Glens Falls before the Redbirds was the Eastern League's Glens Falls Tigers which relocated to London, Ontario and are now based in Trenton, New Jersey as the Trenton Thunder. Former owner Jack Tracz managed the interim operation and the manager for the 1993 season was Steve Turco after a season in which they had. Despite only agreeing to play in Glens Falls for one season, the team led the league in attendance with 78,725 and the team went 37‚Äì40, third in the 4-team McNamara Division, but just 4 games behind the Pittsfield Mets. ===Playing in New Jersey (1994‚Äì2005)=== The team completed its relocation to Augusta, New Jersey, which is located in Sussex County to become the New Jersey Cardinals despite having construction delays on the stadium and the apparent mismanagement by the stadium group which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 120 days before the start of the season. The team still maintained its affiliation with the Cardinals. The new stadium opened on schedule in large part due to the ownership and management of the Cardinals which was headed by Gordon and Klee's general manager Tony Torre. The team played their home games at Skylands Park from 1994‚Äì2005. The team put together a 43‚Äì32 regular-season mark, and then defeated the Jamestown Jammers, 2 games to 1, and the Auburn Astros, 2 games to 0, to win the league title. Over the next nine seasons, the team experienced only one more winning season, going 39‚Äì37 in 2002. While the team suffered through several losing seasons, they quietly established new standards for Minor League Baseball attendance. With the arrival of additional teams in the New York metropolitan area and further stadium mismanagement attendance, began to slip. The Cardinals drew a league- leading 142,417 fans in their inaugural season, following that up with 157,557 in 1995, but 115,342 in 2004. The team relocated again after the 2005 season and were replaced by Sussex Skyhawks of the independent Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball. This team folded after the 2010 season, leaving Skylands Park vacant for the first time in the stadium's history. ===Playing in State College (2006‚Äìpresent)=== In October 2005, the owners agreed to sell the New Jersey Cardinals to a group headed by the principal partners of the Class Double-A Altoona Curve of the Eastern League. This allowed for a professional team to share Medlar Field at Lubrano Park with the host Penn State Nittany Lions baseball team, on whose campus the park stands. After the sale of the team was complete, the New Jersey Cardinals were then relocated to State College to become the State College Spikes. The team's new logo was then unveiled as a young white-tailed deer. The team's new colors became Penn State navy blue, cardinal, old gold, and moonlight yellow. The team still maintained their affiliation with the Cardinals in its first season in State College, but on September 21, 2006, the Spikes ended their affiliation with the Cardinals and became the new Class A-Short Season affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, starting in 2007.. In September 2012, the Spikes switched their affiliation from the Pirates back to the Cardinals. ===2013 Year of the Deer=== 2013 was the first of 2-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals. This would be the best year in the State College Spikes History to date with a winning season of 48‚Äì27 season. They were successful at home, with a strong 30-8 record. on the road was not so nice to them with a record of 18‚Äì19. If they were to make it to playoffs. They needed the home field advantage. They locked up the Pinckney Division over Jamestown Jammers who would make it to playoffs under the wildcard and what was very important Home field advantage. The Spikes would face the Jamestown Jammers for a 3-game Series for the right to play in the Championship game. They would lose the first game of the series and would win the next 2 that were at home and move into championship series against the Tri-City Valley Cats. Where they would win game 1 and return home only to lose and tie the series up, 1‚Äì1. The final game would see the Spikes jump out to a 1-run lead and have Tri-City answer that call with 4 runs. An amazing try in the bottom of the ninth with Mason Katz hitting a 2 run Home run to bring the score to 4‚Äì3 Tri-City but the State College Spikes would go 3 out with Cesar Valera going down swinging for the third and final out. Records were shattered with Jimmy Bosco outfielder hitting for the cycle, David Washington setting the single season record for home runs of 10 and 50 RBIs. Steven Ramos would win the Batting avg. race in the New York Penn League with a .341. This season would also see the Bull Penn have the lowest ERA in all of American Baseball Major League and Minor League. Thanks to the help of great pitchers of Mitch Harris, Kevin Herget, and Jacob Booden. The Spike would have multiple walk-off wins giving this team the nickname \\"cardiac kids\\" and a long list of multiple hit games and turning double plays. The State College Spikes hope to continue this winning ways in 2014 ===2014 records will be broken=== 2014 proved to be the start of a winning season. Most of 2013 players moved up and a new roster entered. One new player named Rowan Wick would belt a record 14 home runs out over the fences, breaking David Washington's record of 12 before being moved up to Single A Advanced. Jake Stone would wear the #32 and follow David Washington's run of Grand Slams belting one out of the park on July 4, the same day David Washington did. Alex Deloan would also join in the home run race hitting, 6 home runs. The State College Spikes team would put Auburn Dubbledays down on July 25, by setting a new single game run record with a score of 17‚Äì3 with the bottom third scoring 9 runs. The team was in the playoff chase again with a 7-game lead over Williamsport Crosscutters as of July 25. ===2016: Another championship comes to State College=== The Spikes jumped out to a large divisional lead early in the 2016 season. While West Virginia and Williamsport both made late runs, State College easily won the Pinckney Division in mid- August and clinched the number one seed in the NYPL playoffs a week later. After taking game one of the semifinals against the Staten Island Yankees on the road, the Spikes lost game two at home to set up a winner-take-all game three. The Spikes won that game to set up a finals clash with the Hudson Valley Renegades, a team that had success against State College during the season and won the regular season series between the teams. Despite that, State College swept Hudson Valley in two games to clinch their second league title since relocation to Happy Valley. ==Affiliation split with Pittsburgh== \\"We're not one of these ownership groups that demands a winner every single year, but we haven't even put playoff tickets on sale,\\" Spikes general manager Jason Dambach said in June 2012. \\"We've never really even come close to the playoffs. \\"So the mandate has been put out there. We didn't have a good team last year, and so it really doesn't make any sense to re-sign with the Pirates until September, if we are to do that.\\" \\"We weren't mad about J.D.'s comments,\\" Pirates president Frank Coonelly said. State College executives say some phone calls, texts and emails were never returned. Greenberg said the affiliation decision from the Spikes' standpoint had \\"zero\\" to do with winning and losing. In September 2012, the Pirates offered State College a player development contract extension. Spikes owner Chuck Greenberg and Coonelly appeared to reach an agreement. However, Greenberg never received a return phone call from anyone with the Pirates‚Äînot owner Bob Nutting, nor Coonelly, nor GM Neal Huntington. Huntington said that \\"relationship endings are not always pretty,\\" and this one appears to fall somewhere in that category. ==Team name== The team name \\"Spikes\\" has a threefold meaning. The club's official logo depicts a young white-tailed deer, for whom a \\"spike\\" is an undeveloped antler, symbolic of a young team member who may develop into a Major League Baseball player. The name also refers to a railroad spike, similar to the way the name \\"Altoona Curve\\" commemorates the famous Horseshoe Curve on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Finally, baseball players have long worn shoes with spikes. The team's official colors are Penn State navy blue, cardinal, old gold, and moonlight yellow. ==Season-by-season records== (Place listed is finish in the six-team Pinckney Division) * 2006: 39‚Äì36 (3rd), manager Mark DeJohn * 2007: 36‚Äì39 (3rd), manager Turner Ward * 2008: 18‚Äì56 (6th), manager Brad Fischer * 2009: 38‚Äì38 (3rd), manager Gary Robinson * 2010: 33‚Äì42 (5th), manager Dave Turgeon * 2011: 31‚Äì44 (n/a), manager Kimera Bartee * 2012: 35‚Äì41 (n/a), manager Dave Turgeon * 2013: 48‚Äì27(1st), manager Oliver Marmol * 2014: 48‚Äì28(1st), manager Oliver Marmol * 2015: 41-35(3rd), manager Johnny Rodriguez * 2017: 40-35 (2nd) * 2018: 36-40 (4th) * 2019: 39-36 (3rd), manager Jose Leon ==Playoffs== *2013 season: Defeated Jamestown 2-1 in semifinals; lost to Tri-City 2-1 in championship. *2014 season: Defeated Hudson Valley 2-1 in semifinals; defeated Tri-City 2-1 to win championship. *2016 season: Defeated Staten Island 2-1 in semifinals; defeated Hudson Valley 2-0 to win championship. ==Roster== ==ReferencesStatistics from Baseball-Reference * Photographs of Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, home of the State College Spikes - Rochester Area Ballparks Category:Baseball teams established in 2006 Category:New York‚ÄìPenn League teams Category:Professional baseball teams in Pennsylvania Category:Sports in State College, Pennsylvania Category:St. Louis Cardinals minor league affiliates Category:Minnesota Twins minor league affiliates Category:New York Mets minor league affiliates Category:New York Yankees minor league affiliates Category:Pittsburgh Pirates minor league affiliates Category:Philadelphia Phillies minor league affiliates Category:2006 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"State College Spikes"},{"id":"3259602","text":"Aphid giving birth by parthenogenesis, the live young growing from unfertilized eggs Thelytoky (from the Greek thƒìlys \\"female\\" and tokos \\"birth\\") is a type of parthenogenesis in which females are produced from unfertilized eggs, as for example in aphids. Thelytokous parthenogenesis is rare among animals and reported in about 1,500 species, about 1 in 1000 of described animal species, according to a 1984 study. It is more common in invertebrates, like arthropods, but it can occur in vertebrates, including salamanders, fish, and reptiles such as some whiptail lizards. Thelytoky can occur by different mechanisms, each of which has a different impact on the level of homozygosity. It is found in several groups of Hymenoptera, including Apidae, Aphelinidae, Cynipidae, Formicidae, Ichneumonidae, and Tenthredinidae. It can be induced in Hymenoptera by the bacteria Wolbachia and Cardinium. == Arrhenotoky and thelytoky in Hymenoptera == Honeybees produce haploid males from unfertilized eggs (arrhenotoky). Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies) have a haplodiploid sex-determination system. They produce haploid males from unfertilized eggs (arrhenotoky), a form of parthenogenesis. However, in a few social hymenopterans, queens or workers are capable of producing diploid female offspring by thelytoky. The daughters produced may or may not be complete clones of their mother depending on the type of parthenogenesis that takes place. The offspring can develop into either queens or workers. Examples of such species include the Cape bee, Apis mellifera capensis, Mycocepurus smithii and clonal raider ant, Cerapachys biroi. ==Automixis== The effects of central fusion and terminal fusion on heterozygosity Automixis is a form of thelytoky. In automictic parthenogenesis, meiosis takes place and diploidy is restored by fusion of first division non-sister nuclei (central fusion) or the second division sister nuclei (terminal fusion). (see diagram). ===With central fusion=== Automixis with central fusion tends to maintain heterozygosity in the passage of the genome from mother to daughter. This form of automixis has been observed in several ant species including the desert ant Cataglyphis cursor, the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, the predaceous ant Platythyrea punctata, and the electric ant (little fire ant) Wasmannia auropunctata. Automixis with central fusion also occurs in the Cape honey bee Apis mellifera capensis, the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica, and the termite Embiratermes neotenicus. Oocytes that undergo automixis with central fusion often display a reduced rate of crossover recombination. A low rate of recombination in automictic oocytes favors maintenance of heterozygosity, and only a slow transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity over successive generations. This allows avoidance of immediate inbreeding depression. Species that display central fusion with reduced recombination include the ants P. punctata and W. auropunctata, the brine shrimp A. parthenogenetica, and the honey bee A. m. capensis. In A. m. capensis, the recombination rate during the meiosis associated with thelytokus parthenogenesis is reduced by more than 10-fold. In W. auropunctata the reduction is 45-fold. Single queen colonies of the narrow headed ant Formica exsecta provide an illustrative example of the possible deleterious effects of increased homozygosity. In this ant the level of queen homozygosity is negatively associated with colony age. Reduced colony survival appears to be due to decreased queen lifespan resulting from queen homozygosity and expression of deleterious recessive mutations (inbreeding depression). ===With terminal fusion=== Automixis with terminal fusion tends to promote homozygosity in the passage of the genome from mother to daughter. This form of automixis has been observed in the water flea Daphnia magna and the Colombian rainbow boa constrictor Epicrates maurus. Parthenogenesis in E. maurus is only the third genetically confirmed case of consecutive virgin births of viable offspring from a single female within any vertebrate lineage. However, survival of offspring over two successive litters was poor, suggesting that automixis with terminal fusion leads to homozygosity and expression of deleterious recessive alleles (inbreeding depression). == See also == * Autotoky * Epitoky * Arrhenotoky == References == Category:Beekeeping Category:Insect reproduction Category:Asexual reproduction ","title":"Thelytoky"},{"id":"3259610","text":"August von der Heydt August von der Heydt (15 February 1801 - 13 June 1874) was an influential German economist.

He helped increase circulation of money at the rate of 12.5%/year. He was responsible for the railways in Prussia and organized new railroad construction and purchased private ones. He reformed the old mining laws, by lowering the tax on the mining industry, ending state supervision, and eliminated the privileges of the miners guild. He also allowed government to be less restrictive of its attitude toward the formation of banks. The formation of many new banks revolutionized Germany by supplying a lot of much needed capital.

Summer temperatures are hot with the average high above ; winters are cold with average low temperatures in January below .accessed Jan 20, 2011 Vegetation is mostly steppe and shortgrass prairie, although pinyon and juniper trees are found in rocky canyons and cottonwoods and willows grow near streams. Western soapberry and netleaf hackberry are common in some areas near canyon bottoms, as well as some larger Gambel oak. Chickasaw plum and fragrant mimosa are occasional on uplands within grass cover. A few ponderosa pines are found on cool, moist hillsides. Wildlife on the grassland includes pronghorn, prairie dogs, lesser prairie chickens, mule deer, elk, wild turkey, golden eagle, swift fox, and infrequent roadrunners.accessed Jan 20, 2011 Three hundred and twenty-eight species of birds, including many Eastern birds at the limit of their range, have been recorded in Baca County where most of the Carrizo unit is located. Most of the Carrizo Unit is in the watershed of Carrizo Creek, a tributary of the Cimarron River. The Timpas Unit is in the watershed of the Purgatoire River, also called the Purgatory and Picketwire River. ==History== The marks of ancient American Indians are found in the Grassland in petroglyphs on many of the rocks and cliff faces in the canyons. Some of the rock art may be as old as 8,000 years and some are so new that they depict horses which arrived in the Southwest with the Spanish in the 16th century. The early Indians lived in rock shelters, some of which have been found in the Grassland, and practiced a hunting and gathering culture. Around 1000 AD, a people called the Apishipa began farming in the region, however their efforts were unsuccessful . Apache inhabited this area when the Spaniards arrived. They were pushed southward by the Comanche in the 18th century. Tipi rings ‚Äì stones holding down the edges of circular tipis ‚Äì are common.accessed Jan 20, 2011 A branch of the Santa Fe Trail ran through the Timpas unit and from the 1820s onward wagon trains from Missouri and Kansas loaded with goods for New Mexico followed the trail. Among the first non-Indian settlers on the Grassland was a group of eleven New Mexican families who settled along the Purgatory River in 1871. In the same year, Eugene and Mary Rourke established a ranch nearby.accessed Jan 20, 2011 Homesteaders soon followed the ranchers and much of the grassland was devoted to growing Broomcorn.

The Army lands were part of the Pi√±on Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS), a facility devoted to military exercises. However, In 2007, the Army announced a plan to expand the PCMS by purchasing additional land and seeking to transfer the lands of the Comanche National Grassland to Army ownership. The expansion plan, to be implemented in several phases, would increase the size of the PCMS to several million acres, making it the largest military base in the United States. If implemented, the plan would virtually eliminate private land ownership and ranching in Southeastern Colorado as well as abolish the National Grassland and displace 17,000 people. Local citizens and politicians protested the expansion plan of PCMS. On 25 November 2013, the Army announced that its plan to expand the Pi√±on Canyon Maneuver site had been cancelled.\\"Mark Udall Welcomes the U.S. Army'd Decision on the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site\\", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o94-Jd5L7DM, accessed 29 July 2015 ==Recreation, Timpas Unit== Fossilized brontosaur tracks in Picketwire Canyon.

The Grassland ranges in elevation from to , and the climate is semi-arid. The Grassland provides opportunities for recreation, including hiking, sightseeing, hunting, and fishing. There are no developed campgrounds; however, camping is allowed. Land patterns are very complex because of the intermingled federal, state, and private lands. In descending order of land area, it is located in parts of Weston, Converse, Campbell, Niobrara, and Crook counties. It is managed together with Medicine Bow - Routt National Forest from Forest Service offices in Laramie, Wyoming; its local ranger district office is in Douglas. == Ecology of Thunder Basin == Thunder Basin National National Grassland is found along the ecotone, or transition zone, between the Great Plains to the east and the sagebrush steppe to the west, and occurs across a gradient of temperature, precipitation, and elevation. As with grasslands in the Great Plains, the Thunder Basin evolved with disturbance from drought, grazing, fire and burrowing mammals. Burrowing mammals play a functional role in the grasslands here, as they do around the world. For example, prairie dogs increase habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity at multiple scales across the landscape by creating burrows and areas of open grassland habitat that differ from the surrounding areas and serve as habitat for other species. Thunder Basin grassland is home to over 100 species of birds; large herbivores such as pronghorn and mule deer; small mammals like black-tailed prairie dogs, white-tailed jackrabbits, cotton tails, kangaroo rats, thirteen lined-ground squirrels, and bats; and predators such as swift fox, badgers, coyote and red fox. Domestic livestock grazing (sheep and cattle) is practiced by ranching families throughout the grassland. The area includes both sagebrush and grassland plant communities, which interact with a range of ecological disturbances to support diverse wildlife species. Researchers surveyed birds on active black-tailed prairie dog colonies and previously burned areas, as well as on paired undisturbed sites, and found that only prairie dog colonies supported breeding habitat for the imperiled mountain plover (Charadrius montanus). On the other hand, large, contiguous areas of sagebrush cover are required to support sage-grouse conservation. Management for biodiversity in this complex ecosystem depends on managing for a shifting mosaic of different disturbances to meet the needs of multiple species. In Thunder Basin, historical wildfires do not promote the invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) as they do in the Great Basin, where a fire- invasion feedback loop leads to plant community conversion in sagebrush ecosystems. ==ReferencesMedicine Bow-Routt National Forests & Thunder Basin National Grassland - U.S. Forest Service Category:Grasslands of Wyoming Category:National Grasslands of the United States Category:Medicine Bow National Forest Category:Routt National Forest Category:Protected areas of Weston County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Converse County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Campbell County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Niobrara County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Crook County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas established in 1960 Category:1960 establishments in Wyoming ","title":"Thunder Basin National Grassland"},{"id":"3259640","text":"{ } M√ºhlhausen was a naval ship in service with the German Navy.

The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Stephen and is the seat of the Archbishop of Bourges. It is in the High Gothic and Romanesque architectural styles. ==History== Cathedral during the day The site occupied by the present cathedral, in what was once the northeastern corner of the Gallo-Roman walled city, has been the site of the city's main church at least since Carolingian times and probably since the foundation of the bishopric in the 3rd century. The present Cathedral was built as a replacement for a mid-11th-century structure, traces of which survive in the crypt. The date when construction began is unknown, although a document of 1195 recording expenditure on rebuilding works suggests that construction was already underway by that date. The fact that the east end protrudes beyond the line of the Gallo-Roman walls and that royal permission to demolish those walls was only granted in 1183 shows that work on the foundations cannot have started before that date. The main phase of construction is therefore roughly contemporaneous with Chartres Cathedral (begun 1194), some to the northwest. As with most Early- and High Gothic cathedrals, the identity of the architect or master-mason is unknown. The choir was in use (though not necessarily complete) by 1214 and the nave was finished by 1255. The building was finally consecrated in 1324. Most of the west fa√ßade was finished by 1270, though work on the towers proceeded more slowly, partly due to the unfavourable rock strata beneath the site. Structural problems with the South tower led to the building of the adjoining buttress tower in the mid-14th century. The North tower was completed around the end of the 15th century but collapsed in 1506, destroying the Northern portion of the fa√ßade in the process. The North tower and its portal were subsequently rebuilt in a more contemporary style. Important figures in the life of the cathedral during the 13th century include William of Donjeon who was Archbishop from 1200 until his death in 1209 (and was canonised by the Pope in 1218 as St William of Bourges) as well as his nephew, Philip Berruyer (archbishop 1236-61), who oversaw the later stages of construction. Following the destruction of much of the Ducal Palace and its chapel during the revolution, the tomb effigy of Duke Jean de Berry was relocated to the Cathedral's crypt, along with some stained glass panels showing standing prophets, which were designed for the chapel by Andr√© Beauneveu. Generally the cathedral suffered far less than some of its peers during the French Wars of Religion and in the Revolution. Its location meant it was also relatively safe from the ravages of both World Wars. The cathedral was added to the list of the World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1992. ==Dimensions and structure== Nave of the Cathedral Bourges Cathedral covers a surface of . The cathedral's nave is wide by high; its arcade is high; the inner aisle is and the outer aisle is high. The use of flying buttresses was employed to help the structure of the building. However, since this was a fairly new technique, one can easily see the walls were still made quite thick to take the force. Sexpartite vaults are used to span the nave. ==Features== ===Plan and elevation=== Floorplan of the cathedral Bourges Cathedral is notable for the simplicity of its plan, which did without transepts but which adopted the double-aisled design found in earlier high-status churches such as the Early-Christian basilica of St Peter's in Rome or in Notre Dame de Paris. The double aisles continue without interruption beyond the position of the screen (now largely destroyed though a few fragments are preserved in the crypt) to form a double ambulatory around the choir. The inner aisle has a higher vault than the outer one, while both the central nave and the inner aisle have similar three-part elevations with arcade, triforium and clerestory windows; a design which admits considerably more light than one finds in more conventional double-aisled buildings like Notre-Dame.Branner, Robert, The Cathedral of Bourges and its Place in Gothic Architecture, Paris (1962) This design, with its distinctive triangular cross section, was subsequently copied at Toledo Cathedral and in the choir at Le Mans.Bony, Jean (1985). French Gothic Architecture of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries, p. 212. University of California Press. . The flying buttresses surrounding the cathedral are relatively slender and efficient, particularly compared to the contemporary but much heavier flyers at Chartres. Their steep angle helps to channel the thrust from the nave vaults and the wind loading on the roof to the outer buttress piers more effectively. ===Portals and fa√ßades=== The west front of Bourges Cathedral The west fa√ßade is on a particularly grand scale when compared to earlier cathedrals. The four side aisles and central nave each have their own portal reflecting the scale of the spaces beyond. As is often the case with Gothic churches, the central portal carries sculpted scenes related to the Last Judgement, whilst the south portals are dedicated to the lives of saints - here St Ursinus and St Stephen. The north portals were destroyed when the tower collapsed but surviving fragments indicate that their sculptural programmes were dedicated to the life and death of the Virgin. Unifying all five portals is a dado screen of gabled niches which stretches the whole width of the fa√ßade. The spandrels between these niches feature an extended Genesis cycle which would originally have told the story from the beginning of Creation to God's Covenant with Noah.Bayard, Tania, Thirteenth-Century Modifications in the West Portals of Bourges Cathedral, in Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 34, No. 3 (Oct., 1975), pp. 215-225 Romanesque carved portals from about 1160-70, probably intended for the fa√ßade of the earlier cathedral, have been reused on the south and north doors (occupying the spaces normally reserved for transept portals). Their profuse ornamentation is reminiscent of Burgundian work. ===Astronomical clock=== Astronomical clock at Bourges Cathedral The astronomical clock of Bourges Cathedral was first installed in November 1424, during the reign of Charles VII, when the royal court was based in Bourges, for the occasion of the baptism of his son the Dauphin (the future Louis XI). Designed by the canon and mathematician Jean Fusoris and constructed by Andr√© Cassart, the clock is housed in a belfry-shaped case painted by Jean Grangier (or Jean of Orl√©ans). The clock's bells chime on the quarter hour, and chime the Salve Regina on the hour. The clock was restored in 1782, 1822, 1841, and completely overhauled in 1872, when the upper dial showing only the time was installed. The zodiac calendar was restored in 1973. The clock was badly damaged by fire in 1986; after a complete restoration, the clock was reinstalled in 1994 with a replica mechanism. The original mechanism is on display in the cathedral. ===Stained glass=== Apart from the axial chapel, Bourges Cathedral retains most of its original ambulatory glass, which dates from about 1215 (around the same time as Chartres Cathedral). The glazing programme includes a famous Typological window (similar to examples at Sens and Canterbury), several hagiographic cycles, the story of the Old Testament patriarch, Joseph and symbolic depictions of the Apocalypse and Last Judgement. Other windows show the Passion and three of Christ's parables; the Good Samaritan, the Prodigal Son and the story of Dives and Lazarus. The French art historian Louis Grodecki identified three distinct masters or workshops involved in the glazing, one of whom may also have worked on the windows of Poitiers Cathedral.Louis Grodecki.

The album booklet features a cartoon by drummer Marcelo Bonf√° depicting the constant guitarist changes that the band went through until they hired Dado Villa-Lobos. The album sold more than 1 million copies, receiving a Diamond Certification by ABPD.Legi√£o Urbana at ABPD It was also the last Legi√£o Urbana album to feature bassist Renato Rocha ‚Äî he would leave the band during the recording sessions of the next release, As Quatro Esta√ß√µes. ==History== The studio recording of Que Pa√≠s √â Este was originally intended for a double album called Mitologia e Intui√ß√£o (\\"Mythology and Intuition\\"; it was also tentatively named Disciplina e Virtude, which means \\"\\"Discipline and Virtue\\"), which would include recordings from this album and the previous one Dois. The idea was rejected and what was left of the project was released in this album. The project was changed because, following Dois's success, the label pressured them for a third album but they didn't have enough repertoire for that. Only \\"Mais do Mesmo\\" and \\"Angra dos Reis\\" were written during the album's sessions. Besides the label's pressure (strengthened by the fact that the band had already missed the agreed deadline of three albums in 36 months), vocalist and acoustic guitarist Renato Russo himself would demand himself to quickly record some songs from his time with Aborto El√©trico (\\"Que Pa√≠s √â Este\\", \\"Conex√£o Amaz√¥nica\\" and \\"T√©dio\\") before Capital Inicial - another band spun off Aborto El√©trico - had the opportunity to do that. This helped the band let go of the idea of an all-new album in favor of some kind of anthology. At that time, they denied having faced any pressure from the label. Villa-Lobos said then: This helped to solve the lack of songs problem. Many of them were originally written when Russo performed under the name \\"Trovador Solit√°rio\\" (Lonely Troubadour) (\\"Faroeste Caboclo\\", for exemple), alone with his acoustic guitar. \\"Que Pa√≠s √â Este\\" and \\"Conex√£o Amaz√¥nica\\", for example, were written in 1978. \\"Eu Sei\\" was written between the end of Aborto El√©trico and the foundation of Legi√£o Urbana; a pirate version of the song was already being aired at some radio stations back then. As such, Russo saw the album as a way of putting an end to the widespread airing of pirate recordings of his songs. The fact that the album involved songs written throughout years is express in its title. Initial versions of \\"Eu Sei\\" and \\"Faroeste Caboclo\\", recorded in 1982 by Russo singing and playing the acoustic guitar, were recovered and released in 2008 on his posthumous solo album O Trovador Solit√°rio. The verse \\"talvez tenhamos que fugir sem voc√™\\" (we may have to flee without you) from \\"Eu Sei\\" originally read \\"talvez tenhamos que correr e perder\\" (we may have to run and lose). The album was ready in just a month. The recording took two weeks and the tracks \\"Que Pa√≠s √â Este\\", \\"Conex√£o Amaz√¥nica\\", \\"T√©dio\\" and \\"Qu√≠mica\\" were recorded in only one take. It was during this album's recording sessions that conflicts erupted between bassist Renato Rocha and the rest of the band and EMI-Odeon personnel. He was constantly late and unable to play his parts the way Russo wanted them to be performed, which made the band start to regret having hired him. == Song information == \\"Angra dos Reis\\" mentions the construction of a nuclear power plant in the city of same name in the state of Rio de Janeiro and \\"Mais do Mesmo\\" would later be the title of a compilation by the band; this was the original planned title for this album. \\"Faroeste Caboclo\\" was composed in 1979 during the \\"O Trovador Solit√°rio\\" era of Renato Russo. Clocking at over nine minutes and possessing no choruses among its 159 verses, the song tells the story of Jo√£o de Santo Cristo. Russo considered it his \\"Hurricane\\". It was the longest song by the band until the release of \\"Metal contra as Nuvens\\" from V. The album also features \\"Depois do Come√ßo\\", the only song by Russo that he admitted to not liking later, since he considered it too pretentious. It was created with Aborto El√©trico's \\"An√∫ncio de Refrigerante\\" as the basis. \\"Qu√≠mica\\" had already been recorded by Os Paralamas do Sucesso in their debut album Cinema Mudo. == Promotion == === Tour === During the tour launched to promote this album, an infamous performance of the band at Man√© Garrincha Stadium in Bras√≠lia took place in June 1988 for an audience of some 50,000 people. The band started the show one hour late. During the fourth song (\\"Conex√£o Amaz√¥nica\\"), Russo was attacked by a man, who was removed by security. As the show continued, the audience started to throw objects at the musicians, to which Russo replied with provocations. After one hour, the band left the stage and a frustrated audience caused a stampede that resulted in 380 injured people The band ended up sued by Distrito Federal's government. Russo even said he would never return to Bras√≠lia after this incident, but he took it back soon after. One month later, when the band performed at Maracan√£zinho in Rio de Janeiro, the audience threw daisies in response to the incident in Brazil's capital. This incident increased Russo's stage fright, and Legi√£o Urbana's following work would become more introspective. ==Track listing== ===Covers=== * Brazilian bands Pato Fu, 14 Bis and Boca Livre have made cover versions of \\"Eu Sei\\". * Metal band Viper have covered \\"Mais do Mesmo\\" on their album Tem pra Todo Mundo. * Os Paralamas do Sucesso and Tit√£s have both covered the title track; the first in their 1999 live album Ac√∫stico MTV, and the latter during a live Legi√£o Urbana tribute by various artists. ==Personnel== Per the booklet: === Legi√£o Urbana === * Dado Villa-Lobos ‚Äî guitars, acoustic guitar, percussion, backing vocals * Renato Russo ‚Äî vocals, keyboards, acoustic guitar * Renato Rocha ‚Äî bass, backing vocals * Marcelo Bonf√° ‚Äî drums, percussion and keyboards === Technical personnel === * Jorge Davidson ‚Äî artistic direction * Mayrton Bahia ‚Äî production direction, executive producer, mixing * Jorge Brum ‚Äî studio assistant * Ricardo Junqueira ‚Äî cover and booklet pictures * Marcelo Benzaqu√™m ‚Äî booklet pictures * Fernanda Villa-Lobos ‚Äî art direction and execution * J.

It was written in both English and Zulu. Henry Callaway was an English missionary. His interest in the Zulu people began when he settled on the banks of the Nsunguze river where he created various books influenced by them. One of those books was The Religious Systems of The Amazulu. The book is presented in question and answer format. It is divided into four different sections which include, Unkulunkulu, Amatonga, Izinyanga Zokubula, and Abatakati. Each of these sections focuses on the four main aspects which constitute the religious system of the Zulu people.T In Crowds and Power, Elias Canetti wrote of The Religious System of the Amazulu, \\"It is among the essential documents of mankind.\\"Canetti, Elias (1962) Crowds and Power. New York: Noonday Press. Page 265. == Biographical Background of Henry Callaway == === Premissionary Work and Quakerism === Henry Callaway was the first missionary bishop of St. John‚Äôs Kafraria in South Africa. He was born on January 17, 1817 at Lymington Somerset. After giving birth to Callaway, his family moved to London and then Crediton where he officially got educated in Crediton Grammar School. Callaway then went to become an assistant teacher in a small school in Heavitree. During his time at Heavitree, he was introduced to the idea of Quakerism by the headmaster of the school, William Dymond. He was prone to the idea of Quakerism and by the Spring of 1837, Henry Callaway was admitted to be the member of the Society of Friends, which is an official group for Quakers. He was admitted through a Quaker family that he privately tutored in Wellington. After his years in teaching, he decided to move into the medical field. === Angelican Church Missionary Work === After pursuing his career in the medical field, he found flaws in Quakerism which made him join the Angelican church. In 1854, he wrote to the bishop of Natal, John William Colenso, offering his service for missionary work. Callaway was then accepted on August 13 by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and ordained deacon at Norwich. He and his wife then left England on the 26th of August to South Africa where Callaway started his missionary work. After 4 years of doing his service, Callaway was granted land beyond the Umkomanzi river, he then settled at an empty Dutch farm on the Insunguze, which he named Spring Vale. From there, Callaway starts learning about the native‚Äôs beliefs, traditions, and customs. He also wanted to unravel the true meaning of Unkulunkulu as there were debates that circled around. Reverend Owen and George Champion stated that Unkulunkulu was a term referred to an Ancient Chief. The other American missionaries declined their idea and made the term Unkulunkulu as a suitable word for God. Callaway decided to do his own independent investigation and lead to making a different conclusion from Colenso and Bleek. Inspired by the ways of the Zulu people, he then published his work, The Religious System of the Amazulu. == Summary of The Religious System of the Amazulu == The Religious System of the Amazulu is a nonfiction book that was written in a question and answer format. This book explains the beliefs, tradition, and culture of the Amazulu people. It is divided into 4 parts, the Unklunkulu, Amantonga, Izinyanga Zokubula, and Abatakato. This book does not contain any sacred narratives, transcription of ceremonies or anything related to the sort. It contains primarily an explanation of concepts that Callaway was interested in. The Unklunkulu focuses on the Unkulunkulu itself and the creation story from the perspective of the Zulu people. The Amatonga talks about the tradition of ancestral worship. The Izinyanga section focuses on traditional diviners. Lastly, the Zokubula is about Zulu‚Äôs medical magic and witchcraft remedy. == Unkulunkulu == There had been many interpretations of the word Unkulunkulu. The American missionaries interpret this word as ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. Reverend Owen and George Champion stated that the word is referred to Ancient Chief. From Callaway‚Äôs independent investigation, he described that the term itself was challenging and enlightening. In 1870, he said that the Unkulunkulu was a word coined from the Gardiner, not the Zulu origins. He stated that the term Unkulunkulu expresses antiquity, age, the old-old one, the great-great-grandfather. Amuzulu people believe that Unkulunkulu was the first ancestor, a being who is neither immortal or eternal. Unkulunkulu is also known as the parents of all Zulu people. They believe that he was the one who taught them how to hunt, make fire, and grow food. Not only the Unkulunkulu, but the first men are also given other names which are Umvelinqangi and Uthlanga. These 3 words expressed different aspects of Unkulunkulu in Zulu's belief. The Amazulu people also believe in the existence of the Amatongo, who are the spirits of ancestors given by Unkulunkulu to guide the people. == Amatonga == The Amatongo is the chapter that focuses on ancestral worship. The Amazulu people believe that they possessed Amatongo ever since they were born. The Amatongo are the ones who will help guide them in their life. In every battle that the Zulu people face, they should be assisted with the Amatongo. Those who died during the battle will then be transformed into Amatongo. Those who survived were to follow a tradition, where they need to sacrifice cattle to the Amatongo. They will then need to pour the gall of their sacrifices to their body while saying ‚ÄúLet the Amatongo be bright and white and not dark that they may save us on another occasion‚Äù. This is how the Amazulu people will show their respect and gratitude to the Amatongo. Callaway wrote that a man‚Äôs Itongo resembles him in character. The word Itongo is a collective term for the inhabitants of the spirit world. There is an Itongo that the Amazulu dreaded. He is the son of Unjikiza, the son of Ukcuba. He was a tall man with a huge muscular body. He was known to not act in accordance with the chief‚Äôs law and acted after his own heart in villages that he had not been sent to. He was treating the people with disrespect, drinking their milk and eating their food without the consent of the owner. None of the villagers were brave enough to turn him in. The other Zulu people finally found out what he did and was killed with his 20 other men. The Amazulu stabbed him all over his body with their assagais. His Itongo is never mentioned unless when any cattles are killed. If someone were to mention his name, the person would be silenced, for he might destroy the village. == Izinyanga Zokubula == The chapter of Izinyangya Zokubula tells about the diviners. It focuses on ways an Amazulu person can be the Izinyangya, the way a person begins their duty to become a diviner, the tasks of becoming a diviner, the story of the greatest Inyanga and Umwathaleni. When a man is ill, the Amazulu people will enquire Umumgoma; a more respectful way to call the Izinyangya for the Amazulu people. The Umumgoma will then point out which doctor of medicine they should go to in order to heal the ill person. If the doctor cannot heal the disease, the doctor will ask the sick person to hear what other diviners say and they may tell the medicine to cure the person with. For a normal person to become a diviner, the Amatongo needs to make the person ill. A lot of sacrificial goats will be needed in order for this person to become the diviner. The gallbladder of the killed goats will be put on the man‚Äôs hair. Afterwards, the person begins to be a diviner. The Amazulu people will then need to challenge the person in many ways to see if the person is a trustworthy diviner. Callaway discovered that one of the challenges could involve diving into a pool to find snakes. The diviner will need to come out of the water and entwine them and make sure that it still lives on the person‚Äôs body. == Abatakati == The Abatakati tells about medical magic and witchcraft of the Amazulu people. Abatakati was left incomplete, one of the parts of the chapter talks about the strength of different medicine that the Amazulu people can use. There are special medicines for the chief which grant the chiefs strength and presence. Common men are not allowed to use or even touch this kind of medicine or they would be killed. This chapter also tells about the Chief‚Äôs power, where the people would resist drinking out of the cup of a chief. The witchcraft part of this chapter is written in ‚ÄúThe Magic of Ufaku‚Äù which tells the dialogue that Callaway had with Ufaku who is the great chief of Amampondo. The Intelezi is a primary element in the daily life of the Amazulu people. They trust the intelezi very much as they keep bringing it most of the time when they want to wash. There are several different types of plants which are called intelezi. The intelezi can only be used for men, as women only wash themselves with water. The time when a man did not bring intelezi, he went to the ford at night. He only washes himself with water only. Washing with intelezi at the ford in the night time is believed to be an unacceptable action as it influences other things for evil. == Impact of The Religious System of The Amazulu == === Dreaming in the Contact Zone: Zulu Dreams, Vision and Religion === The Religious System of the Amazulu still has a direct impact today. An example would be an academic journal called Dreaming in the Contact Zone: Zulu Dreams, Visions and Religion in the Nineteenth-Century in Africa created by David Chidester. In his writing he stated that the British colonialism had obstructed the religious elements of Africa and other aspects of the indigenous patterns. The Africans were unable to dream under the conditions of colonialism because they believed that ‚Äúpower speaks to power‚Äù which they indicated that the ‚ÄúEuropean colonial administrator did all of their dreamings‚Äù. Chidester stated that Callaway called the book, The Religious System of the Amazulu, as ‚Äúsubjective apparition or brain sensation of African dream life‚Äù. In the context of comradeship, this book has drawn together the forces imposed by local officials, the ethnographic research for Christian missionaries, the indigenous Africans and especially for the community of Zulu converts. His book became popular for providing the basis of religious beliefs for anthropologists E. B. Taylor. In the context of colonialism, the book has given insights into spiritual and material aspects of aboriginal dreams in a contact zone. They stated that they have found evidence of dreams linking to maintaining traditional rituals of ancestral exchange and presence. Forbye, they discover disruption of dreaming from the colonial circumstances of dispossession and displacement. The academic journal perceived that the dreams had emigrated under colonial state, the Zulu report suggested that the dreaming remained as a medium for negotiation and navigating within the contact zone. === Zulu Thoughts and Patterns === Axel-Ivar Berglund published a book called Zulu Thoughts and Patterns where he quoted and reflected the elements in The Religious System of The Amazulu. He quoted Callaway's impression of the Zulu back then on how there is no clear distinction between a sky divinity and the shades. Burgland commented that the present Zulu are expressing the clear difference between the Lord of the Sky and the shade. The book also quoted some of the impacts Callaway made through his literature. He made the impact of pulling the interest of missionaries, philologists, ethnologists, antiquarians and the general populace. He stated that The Religious System of the Amazulu has become one of the stepping stones to ‚Äúteach the English Zulu or the Zulu English‚Äù. Nadine Gordimer cited extracts of the book at the beginning of the chapters of her novel The Conservationist. == External links == *The Religious System of the Amazulu (entire text) == References == Category:1870 non-fiction books Category:Mythology books Category:Zulu culture Category:Zulu mythology ","title":"The Religious System of the Amazulu"},{"id":"3259699","text":"√âric Lapointe (born September 13, 1974) is a retired Canadian football player. He was a running back with the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. ==Biography== A native of Brossard, Quebec, Lapointe is an alumnus of Mount Allison University, where he played football for the Mount Allison Mounties. While playing at the university level, he was Canada's Rookie of the Year, a three-time All-Canadian, and a two-time Hec Crighton Trophy winner as Most Outstanding Player in Canada (1996 and 1998), for which he received special congratulations by the Legislature of Nova Scotia.Hansard - Tue., Dec. 1, 1998 He was also a rushing leader for the Atlantic conference and nationally. In 1996, he rushed 1,619 yards to break the record in Atlantic University Sport. In his four years of playing, he rushed 4,666 yards, just 29 yards short of the CIAU all-time career rushing record. Despite being eligible to play for 5 years in Canadian university football, Lapointe graduated and opted to finish his university sports career after only 4 years. He still supports the team and often can be seen at their games in Quebec. After graduation in 1999, Lapointe was selected in the third round (20th overall) of the CFL entry draft by the Edmonton Eskimos but was released shortly afterward to play for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. As part of this 1999 Grey Cup winning team, Lapointe started for only 2 games yet finished 11th in the league with 691 rushing yards. In 2000, Lapointe was traded to the Toronto Argonauts in a multi-player deal but languished and left the team during the 2001 off-season as a free agent to work in the financial services industry, closer to his home in Montreal. Lapointe joined the Montreal Alouettes in February 2001 and played mainly as a backup for the team during the 2001-2004 seasons; during the 2005 season he came into prominence after being named the starting running back for the Alouettes in the 93rd Grey Cup (the Als lost 38-35 to the Esks in a thrilling overtime showdown). In 2005, he was selected by Canadian university football fans as the best university football player of all time.Lapointe tops poll of university football fans - universitysport.ca ===Retirement=== Lapointe announced his retirement from the CFL following the 2006 season and is currently working as a financial analyst in Montreal.

Karfunkel, 2001 (see: References). An excellent example of this phenomenon is fracturing in the quartz formations of the EspinaœÇo mountains of Brazil. For many years, itinerant miners in these mountains have reported the appearance of broken boulders and fissures along the ground after lightning storms. The EspinaœÇo Range represents a typical site for orographic thunderstorms, which develop from the ascent of air along mountain ranges. These storms have the highest rate of lightning occurrence and are therefore useful for studying the effects of such atmospheric discharges. These discharges have peculiar features: velocities of and plasma temperatures of are achieved in nanoseconds in lightning channels. Evidences of the effect of lightning on rock are the presence of beta-quartz (T > , called \\"flashstones\\" by local diggers), melted barbed wires (T > ); furrows in soils and colluvium up to long with the presence of cristobalite, the high-temperature modification of quartz (). In permeable Precambrian quartzites, the instantaneous shock rise of temperature from , or higher, results in an extremely severe explosion-like expansion of water, leading to the formation of fissures and widening of other systems. The evidence points to lightning action, since quartz can change its modification from Œ± to Œ≤ and back again without cracking, as long as the temperature change is less than per minute. For this reason, cracks caused by solar radiation or fire can be ruled out. An enormous pressure of about can be estimated by the presence of coesite relicts, the rare high-pressure polymorph of quartz. This lightning-induced weathering is one of the more important starting mechanisms for other weathering processes. Because of the increase in surface area, chemical weathering can attack each newly made fragment from all sides and can go deeper into bedrock as new cracks are formed or older ones extended. Thus, electromechanical disintegration is a new term for a type of weathering as old as the planet's lithosphere, and it represents an important exogenic process for the beginning of erosion and the formation of soils. == See also == *Fulgurite *Erosion ==Notes== ==References== * Banko, A.

The building and street (formerly Charlotte Street) are named after Sir Frederick Mappin (1821‚Äì1910), the so-called Father of Sheffield University. ==Departments== The Mappin Building is in an area known as the St George's Complex (after the St George's Church building, also owned by the University), and houses much of the Faculty of Engineering. Departments based there are Mechanical Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Electronic and Electrical Engineering and the division Aerospace Engineering. The building also houses St George's IT centre, an open access computer centre available to all university students during office hours. To the rear of the building is the Sir Robert Hadfield Building, home to two other departments: Chemical and Biological Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering. The smaller Amy Johnson Building houses Automatic Control and Systems Engineering. The south wing of the Mappin Street frontage of the main building also housed the Department Of Geology until the department's closure in 1990. ==History== Technical School The oldest part of the building is the former Technical School, the earliest purpose-built building for what is now the University. Designed by Flockton & Gibbs and completed in 1886, it now lies in the centre of the building. The extensive Mappin Street frontage was also designed by Flockton & Gibbs, in a far more demonstrative style. Work began on it in 1902 with the demolition of the former Grammar School on the site, but progressed in three phases and was finally completed in 1913. This part of the building includes the main entrance, the John Carr LibraryNamed after John Carr MBE, died 1992, owner of the John Carr Group of companies (timber trade) and Mappin Hall, a large panelled room with stained glass windows and decorative plaster ceiling, used for various events. It is connected to the Technical School by a bridge. Part of the northern range along Broad Lane and a building behind the Technical School followed, then the connecting Engineering Building along Broad Lane, completed in 1955. This gradual accretion has produced a complex plan and floor numbering scheme: the main entrance is on floor D, with floors A,B, C and C* existing at lower levels in various areas of the building, and floors E, F and G lying above. ==Notes and references== ;Notes ;Bibliography *Sheffield, Ruth Harman and John Minnis, Pevsner Architectural Guides ==External links== *University of Sheffield - Campus Map Category:Grade II listed buildings in Sheffield Category:Sheffield University buildings and structures Category:School buildings completed in 1886 ","title":"Sir Frederick Mappin Building"},{"id":"3259728","text":"Jockey International, Inc. is an American manufacturer, and retailer of underwear, sleepwear and sportswear for men, women, and children.

Jockey is a recognized trademark in 120 countries. ==History== Jockey was originally named Coopers Inc., and was found by Samuel T. Cooper in St. Joseph, Michigan in 1876 as a hosiery business. Cooper began the business when he learned that lumberjacks were suffering from poorly constructed wool socks. In 1900, Cooper began making undergarments. Although business was good enough to merit expansion in 1902, by 1934 Coopers Inc. was nearly bankrupt due to hardships caused by the Great Depression. The company recruited Harry H. Wolf, Sr., to restructure the company. On January 19, 1935, during a blizzard, Coopers Inc. sold the world's first briefs at the Marshall Field's State Street store in downtown Chicago. Designed by an apparel engineer named Arthur Kneibler, briefs dispensed with leg sections and had a Y-shaped overlapping fly. The company dubbed the design the Jockey, since it offered a degree of support that had previously only been available from the jockstrap. Jockey briefs proved so popular that over 30,000 pairs were sold within three months of their introduction. Coopers, having renamed the company Jockey, sent its Mascul-liner plane to make special deliveries of masculine support briefs to retailers across the US. In 1938, when macky were introduced in the UK, they sold at the rate of 3,000 a week. In 1997 Jockey acquired the seamless panties division of Formfit-Rogers, and sold them under the name Form-Fit (this branding was later discontinued). In 1982, Jockey introduced the Jockey For Her line of intimate apparel and underwear. In August 2020, Luke Bryan joined the Jockey International as Brand Ambassador. ==Divisions== In 2000, Jockey began selling products directly on-line. Jockey manufactured Life and Formfit brands temporarily for Wal-Mart and Target. Jockey continues to manufacture the Life brand of men's underwear but discontinued the women's line in 2002.

He is remembered for his work with the Harlem Renaissance in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as his later works in abstract expressionism following his move to Paris in the 1950s. Beauford's younger brother, Joseph, was also a noted painter.Beauford Delaney , University of Tennessee website. Retrieved: January 27, 2013. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Beauford Delaney was born December 30, 1901 in Knoxville, Tennessee. Delaney's parents were prominent and respected members of Knoxville's black community. His father Samuel was both a barber and a Methodist minister. His mother Delia was also prominent in the church, and earned a living taking in laundry and cleaning the houses of prosperous local whites. Delia, born into slavery and never able to read and write herself, transferred a sense of dignity and self-esteem to her children, and preached to them about the injustices of racism and the value of education. Beauford was the eighth of ten children, only four of whom survived into adulthood. He summed up the reasons for this in a journal entry from 1961, saying \\"so much sickness came from improper places to live ‚Äì long distances to walk to schools improperly heated‚Ä¶ too much work at home ‚Äì natural conditions common to the poor that take the bright flowers like terrible cold in nature‚Ä¶\\"Journal of Beauford Delaney, quoted in Leeming 1998:13. Beauford and his younger brother, Joseph, were both attracted to art from an early age. Some of their earliest drawings were copies of Sunday school cards and pictures from the family bible. \\"Those early years which Beauford and I enjoyed together I am sure shaped the direction of our lives as artists. We were constantly doing something with our hands ‚Äì modelling with the very red Tennessee clay, also copying pictures. One distinct difference in Beauford and myself was his multi-talents. Beauford could always strum on a ukulele and sing like mad and could mimic with the best. Beauford and I were complete opposites: me an introvert and Beauford the extrovert.\\"Joseph Delaney, 1978. The Delaneys attended Knoxville's Austin High School, and among Beauford's early works was a portrait of Austin High principal Charles Cansler.Jack Neely, \\"The Life of Knoxville Artist Beauford Delaney (1901-1979) ,\\" Knoxville Mercury, 18 February 2016. When he was a teenager, he got a job as a \\"helper\\" at the Post Sign Company. However, he and his younger brother Joseph were drawing signs of their own. Then some of his work was noticed by Lloyd Branson, an elderly American Impressionist and Knoxville's best known artist. By the early 1920s, Delaney became the apprentice of Branson.Neely, Jack. Knoxville's Secret History. Scruffy City Publishing, 1995. With Branson's encouragement, the 23-year-old Delaney migrated north to Boston to study art. With perseverance, he achieved the artist's education he desired, including informal studies at the Massachusetts Normal School, the South Boston School of Art and the Copley Society. He learned what he called the \\"essentials\\" of classical technique. It was also while in Boston that Delaney had his first \\"intimate experience\\" with a young man in the Public Garden. Through letters of introduction from Knoxville, he also received what he referred to as a \\"crash course\\" in black activist politics and ideas; having associated socially during his years in Boston with some of the most sophisticated and radical African-Americans of the time, such as James Weldon Johnson, writer, diplomat and rights activist; William Monroe Trotter, founder of the National Equal Rights League; and Butler Wilson, Board member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. By 1929, the essentials of his artistic education complete, Beauford decided to leave Boston and head for New York. ===New York City, USA=== His arrival in New York City at the time of the Harlem Renaissance was exciting. Harlem was then the center of black cultural life in the United States. But it was also the time of the Great Depression, and it was this that Beauford was confronted with on his arrival. \\"Went to New York in 1929 from Boston all alone with very little money‚Ä¶this was the depression, and I soon discovered that most of these people were people out of work and just doing what I was doing ‚Äì sitting and figuring out what to do for food and a place to sleep.\\"Journal of Beauford Delaney, quoted in Leeming 1998:32. Delaney felt an immediate affinity with this \\"multitude of people of all races ‚Äì spending every night of their lives in parks and cafes\\" surviving on next to nothing. Their courage and shared camaraderie inspired him to feel that \\"somehow, someway there was something I could manage if only with some stronger force of will I could find the courage to surmount the terror and fear of this immense city and accept everything insofar as possible with some calm and determination\\". Members of this disenfranchised community became the subjects of many of Delaney's greatest New York period paintings. In New York \\"he painted colourful, engaging canvasses that captured scenes of the urban landscape‚Ä¶his works from that period express, in an American Modernist vein, not only the character of the city, but also his personal vision of equality, love, and respect among all people\\".Canterbury 2004. Portrait of James Baldwin, 1957 One of Delaney's works from this period, Can Fire in the Park (oil on canvas, 1946), where a group of men huddle together for warmth and companionship around an open fire, is described by the Smithsonian American Art Museum as a \\"disturbingly contemporary vignette [which] conveys a legacy of deprivation linked not only to the Depression years after 1929 but also to the longstanding disenfranchisement of black Americans, portrayed here as social outcasts‚Ä¶ Despite its sober subject, the scene crackles with energy, the culmination of Delaney's sharp pure colors, thickly applied paints, and taut, schematic patterning. Abandoning the precise realism of his early academic training, Delaney developed a lyrically expressive style that drew upon his love of musical rhythms and his improvisational use of color.\\" Works such as Can Fire in the Park \\"hover between representation and abstraction as that style evolved during the 1940s.\\" Delaney eventually obtained work as a bellhop, and later as a doorman, caretaker, and janitor. In exchange for working at the Whitney as a guard, telephone operator and gallery attendant, Delaney received a studio space and a place to live.\\"Gates, H. L. and Appiah K. A. (2005). Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American Experience (5 Volume Set). Oxford University Press P.353. . He also managed to find \\"little corners in the world of the Great Depression that would or could be receptive to his work.\\"Leeming 1998:36. In time, Delaney established himself as a well known part of the bohemianism of the art scene of the period. His friends included the \\"poet laureate\\" of the period, Countee Cullen, artist Georgia O'Keeffe, and writer Henry Miller, among many others. He became the \\"spiritual father\\" of the young writer James Baldwin. Despite the friendships and successes of this period, he remained a rather isolated individual. David Leeming, in his 1998 biography Amazing Grace: a life of Beauford Delaney, presents Delaney as having led a very \\"compartmentalized\\" life in New York. In Greenwich Village, where his studio was, Delaney became part of a gay bohemian circle of mainly white friends; but he was furtive and rarely comfortable with his sexuality. When he traveled to Harlem to visit his African-American friends and colleagues, Delaney made efforts to ensure that they knew little of his other social life in Greenwich Village. He feared that many of his Harlem friends would be uncomfortable or repelled by his homosexuality. He had \\"a third life\\" centered on questions concerning the aesthetics and development of modernism in Europe and the United States; primarily influenced by the ideas of his friends, photographer Alfred Stieglitz and the cubist artist Stuart Davis (painter), and the paintings of the European modernists and their predecessors like C√©zanne, Matisse, Picasso and Van Gogh. The pressures of being \\"black and gay in a racist and homophobic society\\" would have been difficult enough, but Delaney's own Christian upbringing and \\"disapproval\\" of homosexuality, the presence of a family member (his artist brother Joseph) in the New York art scene and the \\"macho abstract expressionists emerging in lower Manhattan's art scene\\" added to this pressure. So he \\"remained rather isolated as an artist even as he worked in a center of major artistic ferment‚Ä¶ A deeply introverted and private person, Delaney formed no lasting romantic relationships.\\"Neuman 2005. While he worked to incorporate African-American influences, such as the \\"Negro\\" idiom of jazz, into his own artwork, he often preferred to visit one of the clubs when he was in Harlem rather than join in the serious socio-political discussions or \\"Negro art\\" questions that were taking place at the \\"306 Group\\" or the Harlem Artists Guild. Though he resisted thinking of himself as a Negro artist, Beauford had tremendous pride in black achievement. He was also pleased to participate in a number of black artists exhibitions with fellow artists like Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Hale Woodruff, Selma Burke, Richmond Barth√©, Norman Lewis and his brother Joseph Delaney. The Smithsonian American Art Museum notes that \\"neither early success nor gracious spirit spared Delaney from the obscurity and poverty\\" that plagued most of his adult life. Brooks Atkinson wrote in his 1951 book Once Around the Sun: \\"No one knows exactly how Beauford lives. Pegging away at a style of painting that few people understand or appreciate, he has disciplined himself, not only physically but spiritually, to live with a kind of personal magnetism in a barren world.\\" Delaney's paintings seem to say, \\"I may be suffering, but what an experience this is\\". Delaney's work \\"is never depressing, though Beauford was often depressed; he could say yes to life in spite of the fact that life was kicking him in the butt.\\"Biographer, David Leeming, quoted in Neely 1997. ===Paris, France=== Plaque in tribute to Beauford Delaney, rue d'Odessa, Paris, France In 1953, at the age of 52, and just as the center of the art world was shifting to New York, Delaney left New York for Paris. Europe had already attracted many other African-American artists and writers who had found a greater sense of freedom there. Writers Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Chester Himes, Ralph Ellison, William Gardner Smith and Richard Gibson, and artists Harold Cousins, Herbert Gentry and Ed ClarkStudio Museum in Harlem (1996) Explorations in the City of Light. New York: Studio Museum in Harlem. January 18 ‚Äì June 2, 1996. Texts by Kinshasa Holman Conwill, Catherine Bernard, Peter Selz, Michel Fabre, Valerie J. Mercer. had all preceded him in journeying to Europe. In his journal, Richard Wright described Paris as \\"a place where one could claim one's soul.\\" Europe became Delaney's home for the remainder of his life. About his new life and possibilities, Beauford entreated himself to \\"Keep the faith and trust in so far as possible. Love humility and don‚Äôt mind the insinuations that cause sorrow‚Ä¶and loneliness and limitations. We learn self-reliance and to hear the voice of God, too‚Ä¶and how to‚Ä¶not break but bend gently. Learning to love is learning to suffer deeply and with quietness.\\"Journal of Beauford Delaney, quoted in Leeming 1998:127. His years in Paris led to a dramatic stylistic shift from the \\"figurative compositions of New York life to abstract expressionist studies of color and light.\\" \\"Delaney's relationship with abstraction predated the notorious Abstract Expressionist movement, positioning him as a forerunner of one of the most important ideological and stylistic developments in twentieth-century American art. Although he chose not to identify himself with the movement, as the Abstract Expressionists began to gain notoriety in the late 1940s, Delaney's abstract work increasingly gained attention.\\"Adrienne Childs, University of Maryland. Though abstract expressionist work predominated during this period, Delaney still produced figurative compositions. His portrait of James Baldwin (1963, pastel on paper) is described by the US National Portrait Gallery as \\"heated and confrontational, its harsh colors roughly applied\\" and glowing with \\"the vibrant, Van Gogh-inspired yellow the artist often used after he moved to Paris.\\" The portrait \\"is both a likeness based on memory and a study in light.\\" Delaney's drive to continuously paint resulted in him using his raincoat when he was out of canvas, \\"Untitled, 1954\\" is an oil on raincoat fragment. ===Mental deterioration=== By 1961, heavy drinking had begun to impair Delaney's often fragile mental and physical health.Heartney 1994 Periods of lucidity were interrupted by days and sometimes weeks of madness.Leeming 1998. This pattern continued for the remainder of his life. Continued poverty, hunger and alcohol abuse fueled his deterioration. James Baldwin said, \\"He has been starving and working all of his life ‚Äì in Tennessee, in Boston, in New York, and now in Paris. He has been menaced more than any other man I know by his social circumstances and also by all the emotional and psychological stratagems he has been forced to use to survive; and, more than any other man I know, he has transcended both the inner and outer darkness.\\"James Baldwin, December 4, 1963. He returned briefly to the United States in 1969 to see his family, dogged by mental illness. He believed malicious people came to him at night \\"and speak unpleasant and vulgar language and threaten malicious treatment‚Ä¶interfering with my health and urgent work‚Ä¶the constant, continuous creation.\\"Journal of Beauford Delaney. He returned to his work in Paris in January 1970. In the early 1970s it became clear that he could no longer cope with daily life. In the autumn of 1973 his friend, Charley Boggs, wrote to James Baldwin, \\"Our blessed Beauford is rapidly losing mental control.\\" His friends tried to care for him but, in 1975, he was hospitalized and then committed to St Anne's Hospital for the Insane. Beauford Delaney died in Paris while at St Anne's on March 26, 1979. In his Introduction to the Exhibition of Beauford Delaney opening December 4, 1964 at the Gallery Lambert, James Baldwin wrote, \\"the darkness of Beauford's beginnings, in Tennessee, many years ago, was a black-blue midnight indeed, opaque and full of sorrow. And I do not know, nor will any of us ever really know, what kind of strength it was that enabled him to make so dogged and splendid a journey.\\" ==Legacy== Following his death, he was praised as a great and neglected painter but, with a few notable exceptions, the neglect continued. A retrospective of his work at the Studio Museum in Harlem a year before his death did little to revive interest in his work. It was not until the 1988 exhibition Beauford Delaney: From Tennessee to Paris, curated by the French art dealer Philippe Briet at the Philippe Briet Gallery, that Delaney's work was again exhibited in New York, followed by two retrospectives in the gallery: \\"Beauford Delaney: A Retrospective [50 Years of Light]\\" in 1991, and \\"Beauford Delaney: The New York Years [1929‚Äì1953]\\" in 1994. \\"Whatever Happened to Beauford Delaney?\\", an article by Eleanor Heartney, appeared in Art in America in response to the 1994 exhibition asking why this once well regarded \\"artist's artist\\" was now virtually unknown to the American art public. \\"What happened? Is this another case of an over-inflated reputation returning to its true level? Or was Delaney undone by changing fashions which rendered his work unpalatable to succeeding generations? Why did Beauford Delaney so completely disappear from American art history?\\" The author believed that Delaney's disappearance from the consciousness of the New York art world was linked to \\"his move to Paris at a crucial moment in the consolidation of New York's position as the world's cultural capital and his work's irrelevance to the history of American art as it was being written by critics\\" at the time. The article concludes, \\"Today [1994] as those histories unravel and are replaced by narratives with a more varied and colorful weave, artists like Delaney can be seen in a new light.\\"Heartney 1994. In 1985 James Baldwin described the impact of Delaney on his life, saying he was \\"the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, he would have been recognised as my Master and I as his Pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow.\\"James Baldwin, from The Price of the Ticket, 1985. He further wrote, \\"Perhaps I should not say, flatly, what I believe ‚Äì that he is a great painter ‚Äì among the very greatest; but I do know that great art can only be created out of love, and that no greater lover has ever held a brush.\\" Delaney's work has now been exhibited by, among others, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Harvard University Art Museums, Art Institute of Chicago, Knoxville Museum of Art, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, The Newark Museum, The Studio Museum in Harlem, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. His work has also been exhibited by a number of galleries, including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery and the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery in New York City. ==The Beauford Delaney burial site== In 2009 freelance writer Monique Y. Wells was researching an article on African-American gravesites in Paris when she learned that Delaney was buried in an unmarked grave at the Parisian Cemetery of Thiais. She discovered that Delaney's remains would be exhumed before the end of the year if the \\"concession\\" (the equivalent of a lease) on his grave was not renewed. Friends of Delaney gathered the sum required, and Wells paid the fee to the cemetery to preserve Delaney's resting place. Tombstone of painter Beauford Delaney at the Parisian Cemetery of Thiais in Thiais, France The same friends expressed a desire to place a marker at Delaney's gravesite, and Wells was inspired to found a French non-profit association to facilitate fundraising for a tombstone. Called Les Amis de Beauford Delaney, the association was created in November 2009. Fundraising began in February 2010, and the association collected sufficient funds to proceed with ordering and installing the stone by June 2010. The installation was completed by August 2010. Les Amis de Beauford Delaney organized a commemorative ceremony to inaugurate the tombstone, which took place on October 14, 2010. Several friends and admirers of Delaney gathered at Thiais Cemetery under blue skies and brilliant sunlight to honor him. Wells presided over the ceremony as president of the organization. Readings were given by Reverend Doctor Scott Herr and personal friends of Delaney. Singer ferritia-fatia sang \\"Come Sunday\\". Wells gave her own tribute to Delaney, and laid an arrangement of yellow roses on the tombstone.Celebrating Beauford! ‚Äì The Gravesite Ceremony , Les Amis de Beauford Delaney blog, October 20, 2010.

Through more than two decades and a few lineup changes, the band released eight studio albums and two live albums, and were pioneers in what would later be called Alternative music in the Christian world. The band was known for the spiritual growth shown in their music as their career progressed; CCM Magazine once called them \\"the band that grew up in public.\\" ==History== Undercover started as a second-generation Jesus movement based band, associated with Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa and its Maranatha! Music record label. \\"God Rules,\\" the title track of the second album, is the song that set apart Undercover in the Christian music scene from the rest of the \\"beginning\\" bands. While the band has seen several members come and go (and come again), Taylor has said on more than one occasion that the band decided sometime after 1994's Forum that \\"Undercover is Ojo, Gym, Sim, and Gary,\\" emphasizing that any other lineup, if any, would in the future be called something else. Undercover played two reunion shows in California in August 2005. In a message posted on the band's forum that month, Taylor wrote, \\"We are internally, as a band, trying to figure out where to go from here and what that might look like, given our life realities and burning desire to fulfill whatever musical calling we might have, too. We appreciate your prayers.\\" ==Music== When Undercover released its first album in 1982, it was described by some as \\"Christian punk,\\" characterized by high-energy anthems, rebellious themes, and short, three- chord songs. Mohawk hairstyles, tattoos, and torn jeans did little to convince people otherwise; nor did the next few albums, which contained punk versions of traditional hymns (\\"Holy Holy Holy\\"), shouted vocals (\\"God Rules\\"), and simplistic, direct lyrics (\\"Jesus is the Best\\"). The CCM Magazine review of their God Rules album claimed the band was New Wave rather than punk, as \\"the anarchy of punk is 180 degrees opposite of these boys.\\" 1986's Branded took Undercover in a different direction with keyboard-laden melodies and darker, more introspective lyrics. In \\"Pilate\\", sung from the point of view of Pontius Pilate, the persona struggles with the guilt of having crucified Jesus, confessing, \\"I killed him, I killed him after all.\\" Other song titles on this album were \\"Cry Myself to Sleep\\" and \\"Darkest Hour.\\" On future releases, the band would continue to explore aspects of Christian life not frequently addressed by the CCM musicians who were finding increasing acceptance on secular airwaves and with secular audiences. The next several albums each differed slightly in musical tone from the others, but the introspective lyrics would be a constant through the rest of the band's career. == Members == Current * Ojo Taylor (also credited as Joey Taylor, O-Joe Taylor, and Turner Burn) ‚Äì bass, keyboards, occasional vocals * Gym Nicholson (also credited as Jim Nicholson and Neel Down) ‚Äì guitars * Sim Wilson ‚Äì vocals * Gary Dean Olson ‚Äì drums, percussion Former * Ric Alba ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals * Danny Pavlis ‚Äì drums, vocals * Bill Walden ‚Äì lead vocals, saxophone * Dave Hackbarth ‚Äì handclaps, vocals * Rob Gallas ‚Äì vocals * Chuck Cummings ‚Äì drums * Dave Raven ‚Äì drums == Discography == === Original releases === * Undercover. 1982, MRS Records. * God Rules. 1983, A&S; Records. * Boys and Girls Renounce the World. 1984, A&S; Records. * Branded. 1986, Blue Collar Records. * \\"You & I - EP\\". 1987 B-1 Music. * 3-28-87 (live album). 1988, Broken Records. * Balance of Power. 1990, Broken Records. * Devotion. 1992, Brainstorm Artists International. * Forum. 1994, WAL. * Live at Cornerstone 2000. 2000, Millennium 8. * I Rose Falling. 2002, Galaxy21 Music. === Solo projects === * Relative (Ojo Taylor, as \\"Ojo\\"). 1988, Broken Records. === Anthologies === * Volume 1 (compilation of Undercover and God Rules). 1988, Broken Records. * Volume 2 (compilation of Boys and Girls Renounce the World and Branded). 1988, Broken Records. * Anthology Volume 1 (compilation of first four original releases). 1996, Innocent Media. * Anthology Volume 2 (compilation of next four original releases). 1997, Innocent Media. == References == == External links == Category:Christian punk groups Category:Musical groups from Orange County, California ","title":"Undercover (band)"},{"id":"3259777","text":"Iuga of Moldavia (14th century ‚Äì July 19, 1400) (known also as Iurg or Iurie in Romanian literature, Yury in Ruthenian, Jerzy in Polish; the epithet Ologul means \\"the Crippled\\")P.

According to one hypothesis, he may have been the Lithuanian prince George Koriatovich. Other hypotheses posit him as the son of Roman I of Moldavia (1391‚Äì1394) and an unknown wife, possibly of Lithuanian extraction from descendants of Karijotas, confused with the Lithuanian prince because of the similar name and background. The nickname \\"the Crippled\\" can be found only in the chronicle of Putna Monastery, drafted in the first years of the 16th century, but its origins are unknown. The reasons why he has remained in history with this nickname are not known precisely (probably suffered from a disease that makes it difficult to move). ==Biography== Iuga Ologul was the second son of Moldovan regnant Roman Mu»ôat and Anastasia Mushat.

This confusion is due to the fact that the name Iuga is a locally adapted version of the Ruthenian name Yuri. In fact, it is assumed that Iuga Ologul was baptized in honor of this prince, since he was the son of Roman the Ist and of his first wife, the Lithuanian princes of Koriatovites origin, the rulers of Podolia.Documenta Romaniae Historica A.

It is assumed that Stephen the I-st appointed Iuga Ologul as successor, since his children, Bogdan and Stephen (recalled only in the bead roll ( \\"pomelnik\\") of St. Nicholas Monastery, Probota Veche, founded by their father) were too young succeed the throne and the boyars had a great influence in the country's politics and could have imposed their own candidate. Iuga Ologul was challenged from the very beginning, by his stepbrother Alexander, who at his father's death had fled together with his brother Bogdan, according to a source at Curtea de Arge»ô (under his protection Mircea cel Batrin, Lord of Wallachia).Nicolae Grigora»ô, »öara Rom√¢neascƒÉ a Moldovei de la √Æntemeierea statului p√¢nƒÉ la »òtefan cel Mare (1359-1457), Ia»ôi, 1978, p. 74-77 The documents of that time, pointed out that Mircea Voda entered to Moldova, leading the army and installed Alexandru for reigning.

The term was popularized by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov (1772-1810) to refer to an unstructured, spontaneous and individualized form of prayer and meditation through which one would establish a close, personal relationship with God and ultimately see the Divinity inherent in all being.Likutey Moharan I, 52. ==Background== Secluded meditation practices were encouraged by many medieval rabbis, such as Abraham Maimonides, Abraham Abulafia, Joseph Gikatilla, Moses de Leon, Moses Cordovero, Isaac Luria, and Chaim Vital. The founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, encouraged his close disciples to find deveikus through hisbodedus and by meditating on the kabbalistic unifications (yichudim) of Isaac Luria. Rebbe Nachman of Breslov also wrote extensively about these practices and claimed that they were practiced by the forefathers of Judaism‚ÄîAbraham/Avraham, Isaac/Yitzchak, Jacob/Yaakov, Moses/Moshe, David, the prophets, and their students‚Äîas well as the Torah leaders of each generation.Rabbi Avraham ben HaRambam in HaMaspik l'Ovdei Hashem, Hisbodedus. ==Rebbe Nachman's Method== Breslover Hasid practicing hitbodedut in the Jerusalem Forest. Hitbodedut can be performed indoors or amidst nature, and alternatively at night. The method involves talking to God in an intimate, informal manner while secluded in a private setting such as a closed room or a private outdoor setting. Rebbe Nachman taught that the best place for hitbodedut is in the forests or fields. \\"When a person meditates in the fields, all the grasses join in his prayer and increase its effectiveness and power,\\" he wrote.Likutey Moharan II, 11. He also suggested practicing hitbodedut in the middle of the night, when the desires and lusts of this world are at rest,Likutey Moharan I, 52. although doing it during the day is just as effective. During a session of hitbodedut, the practitioner pours out his heart to God in his own language, describing all his thoughts, feelings, problems and frustrations. Nothing was viewed by Rebbe Nachman as being too mundane for discussion, including business dealings, conflicting desires and everyday interactions. Even the inability to properly articulate what one wishes to say is viewed as a legitimate subject to discuss with God. One should also use the opportunity to examine his behavior and motivations, correcting the flaws and errors of the past while seeking the proper path for the future. If one is absolutely unable to speak to God, then Rebbe Nachman advised saying one word with as much strength as possible. He taught that saying that word over and over again will eventually lead to a breakthrough; God will have compassion on the person and they will eventually be able to express themselves.Likutey Moharan II, 96. Rebbe Nachman told his leading disciple, Reb Noson, that hitbodedut should be practiced in a simple, straightforward manner, as if he were conversing with a close friend.Tzaddik #439; Kochavey Or #4. He also advised: > \\"It is very good to pour out your thoughts before God like a child pleading > before his father. God calls us His children, as it is written (Deuteronomy > 14:1), \\"You are children to God.\\" Therefore, it is good to express your > thoughts and troubles to God like a child complaining and pestering his > father.\\"Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #7. ==Silent meditation== Hitbodedut also lends itself to certain silent meditation techniques. One is the \\"silent scream,\\" which Rebbe Nachman himself practiced. He described the silent scream as follows: > You can shout loudly in a \\"small still voice\\"‚Ä¶ Anyone can do this. Just > imagine the sound of such a scream in your mind. Depict the shout in your > imagination exactly as it would sound. Keep this up until you are literally > screaming with this soundless \\"small still voice.\\" > This is actually a scream and not mere imagination. Just as some vessels > bring the sound from your lungs to your lips, others bring it to the brain. > You can draw the sound through these nerves, literally bringing it into your > head. When you do this, you are actually shouting inside your brain.Rabbi > Nachman's Wisdom #16. Another form of hitbodedut is called bitul (nullification), in which the practitioner meditates on God's presence to the exclusion of all other things, including himself. Hitbodedut is performed in one's mother tongue, in contrast to most other Jewish prayers that are recited in Hebrew. Rebbe Nachman did not intend for hitbodedut to take the place of the three daily prescribed Jewish services, but to supplement them. He recommended that his followers engage in hitbodedut for at least one hour each day. Hitbodedut is a staple practice for all Breslover Hasidim. The practice has been much publicized throughout Israel and the Jewish diaspora as a unique form of Jewish meditation, and is practiced by some Jews who are not Breslover Hasidim. ==See also== *Breslov (Hasidic dynasty) *Nachman of Breslov *Jewish meditation ==References== ==Further reading== *Bergman, Ozer (2006).

It closely resembles its sister species, the Australian salmon, although it grows to a smaller size.* Juvenile Eastern Australian Salmon video on Youtube Like the other members of its genus, it is found in cooler waters around the southern coast of Australia.* Dianne J. Bray, 2011, Australian Herring, Arripis georgianus, in Fishes of Australia, accessed 10 Sep 2014, http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/405 It is not biologically related to the herring family Clupeidae. In Australia, additional vernacular names used for this fish include bull herring, herring, rough, ruffies, sea herring, tommy, tommy rough and South Australian roughy. Ruff is the global fisheries name used by the Food and Agriculture Organization. ==Description== The Australian herring has a streamlined, moderately deep and slightly elongate body which is somewhat compressed and has a relatively thin caudal peduncle. It has a quite small head with rather large eyes and a moderately large oblique mouth with the maxillae extending as far as thelevel of the centre of eyes. It has a narrow band of small, pointed teeth on each jaw. It has an almost straight lateral line. The whole of the head and body, except for the lower jaw, snout and over the eyes is covered in small, finely ctenoid scales. The long dorsal fin has a small notch between the higher spiny and the soft rayed parts, They have a small anal fin which is around half the length of the soft part of the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is deeply forked, the pectoral fins are small and the pelvic fins are moderately sized, having their origin underneath the centre of the pectoral fin base and extending midway to the anus. Australian herring are similar to the juveniles of the congeneric Australian salmon and are told from that species by their comparatively larger yellow and black eye and rounder head. This species is silver in colour with black tips on tail and gold spots along the upper body. The juveniles have dark golden bars on their flanks. The dorsal fin contains 9 spines and 16 soft rays and the anal fin has 3 spines and 10 soft rays. The maximum fork length recorded is but they are commonly . ==Distribution== The Australian herring is endemic to the temperate seas of southern Australia from the Swan River in Western Australia along the south coast and along the east coast as far north as Forster, New South Wales. It is also found around Tasmania. ==Habitat and biology== Australian herring form large schools in sea-grass meadows, off beaches, over reefs, in coastal bays and in estuaries. They are normally found near the surface, going no deeper than a few metres. They are predators feeding on smaller fishes and some invertebrates which live among the weed beds and sea grass meadows. These fish reach sexual maturity at around 2-3 years of age and once mature they move westwards along the Australian coast to an area of the southwestern coast where they spawn alongside adults resident in that area. The spawning takes place in April to June. The fertility of the females depends on their size, a long individual may lay 50,000 eggs while a females ay lay 200,000 eggs in a spawning season. The eggs, larvae and juveniles are planktonic and drift southwards along the western coast of Asutraliaand eastward along its south coast by the prevailing winds and currents, the Leeuwin Current being particularly important in this. At length the juveniles settle in the winter and spring using nursery sites along the south coast. Some remain close to where the spawning grounds along the southern part of the western coast of Western Australia. Geographe Bay appears to be a very important source of recruitment for the west coast population. Once they have spawned, the adult fish remain off the west coast of Western Australia and do not return to the south coast. They disperse along the coast, they move into estuaries and go as far north as Shark Bay. ==Fisheries== In most of Australia this is a species which is considered to be a desirable recreational fish. However, in Western Australia it is regarded as a commercially important species for fisheries and has been caught using lines, gill nets and seine nets. They were fished for using 'G' trap nets but following scientific advice on the health of the stock this was banned in 2015. It has a soft, slightly oily flesh and is thought of as a high quality food fish. ==Taxonomy and species description== The Australian herring was first formally described as Centropristes georgianus in 1831 by Achille Valenciennes with the type locality given as King George Sound in Western Australia. When Leonard Jenyns placed it in the new genus Arripis this was a monospecific genus and Arripis georgianus was therefore the type species. ==References== * * ==External links== * Fisheries Western Australia, Australian Herring Fact Sheet Australian herring Category:Fish of Australia Category:Marine fish of Southern Australia Australian herring ","title":"Australian herring"},{"id":"3259823","text":"Pramathesh Chandra Barua (24 October 1903 ‚Äì 29 November 1951) was an Indian actor, director, and screenwriter of Indian films in the pre-independence era, born in Gauripur. ==Early life== Barua was the son of the Zamindar of Gauripur, Assam, where he was born and spent his childhood. He studied at Hare School, Calcutta and then Bachelor of Science graduated from Presidency College, Calcutta in 1924. At age 18, while still studying in college, he got married. It was arranged by the family. He had two more marriages. His third wife was film actress Jamuna Barua. One of his wives, either Madhuri Lata or Amalabala, and singer Meena Kapoor's mother were sisters. In other words, one of his wives was Meena Kapoor's aunt. After his graduation, he travelled to Europe, where he received his first exposure to films. After returning, he served for a time in the Assam Legislative Assembly and joined the Swaraj Party but ultimately moved to Calcutta and later began a career in films, much to the chagrin of his father. ==Career== Pramathesh Barua‚Äôs stepping into the world of films was accidental. He was introduced to Dhirendranath Ganguly during his stay in Shantiniketan. Pramathesh Barua started his film career in 1926 as a member of British Dominion Films Ltd. In 1929, he appeared for the first time on the silver screen in a film named Panchashar which was directed by Debaki Kumar Bose. He also acted in Takay Ki Na Hay, another film directed by Dhiren Ganguly. Around this time, an actress of silent era named Irish Gasper (Screen Name: Sabita Devi) urged Pramathesh Barua to go independent and build his own studio. Pramathesh Barua wanted to go to Europe and get a practical knowledge of the art and craft of film-making. In 1930, his father Raja Prabhat Chandra Barua sent Pramathesh to England for removal of a kidney stone. After the successful operation, he went to Paris with a letter of introduction from Rabindranath Tagore and met M Rogers. He received thorough training in cinematography in Paris. He learned a lot about lighting in studios at the Fox Studio. He also observed the production of Elstree Studios in London. He returned to Calcutta after purchasing lighting euipments and set up Barua Film Unit and Barua Studio in his own residence in Calcutta. He then made the first film Apradhi where he was the main lead role and it was directed by Debaki Kr. Bose. Apradhi is a very important film in the history of Indian cinema as it was the first Indian film which was shot under artificial lights. Prior to that Indian films were shot with the help of reflected sunrays. While using artificial lights, he also made necessary changes in the makeup process to suit the lighting. This experimentation led to a wastage of 50,000 feet of ‚Äòpicture negative‚Äô and another 1,000 feet of ‚Äòpicture negative‚Äô was wasted with experimentation of make-up of artists. Apradhi thus brought radical changes to the technical environment for Directors in Indian cinema. In 1932, he produced films like Nisher Dak and Ekada. The story of Ekada was written by him and it was directed by Sushit Mazumder. He played villain in the film Bhagyalakshmi which was directed by Kali Prasad Ghosh for Indian Cinema Arts. In 1932, when the talkie era came he made his first talkie named Bengal-1983. Released by Rabindranath Tagore, it was a brave attempt by him due to the subject matter. It was shot in 8 days, which showed the tenacity and single-mindedness of Pramathesh Barua. The film was disaster which left Barua with no choice but wind up his company. In 1933, he was invited by BN Sarkar to join New Theatres and this led him to the zenith of his career as a film-maker. He excelled in all technical aspects of film-making ‚Äì direction, acting, script writing, photograph composition, editing or any other necessary skills. He now directed Rooplekha, the first talkie of New Theatres, also played the lead role opposite Umashashi. Released in 1934, Rooplekha introduced another new technique. For the first time in Indian cinema, flashback was used for storytelling. Pramathesh-Barua then came Devdas. It was not the first time that Sarat Chandra Chatterjee‚Äôs tragic hero of the Bengali classic was adapted in Indian films, but Barua‚Äôs portrayal of Devdas was so lively that the made the tragic hero a legend. He directed both the Bengali and Hindi versions and played the lead role in the Bengali version.It has been said that Pramathesh Barua‚Äôs lifestyle made it possible for him to act the role of Devdas so convincingly. Devdas was released in 1935 and it was an instant commercial success. Cine scholars have said that it was the first successful social film in India and it changed the entire outlook of Indian social pictures. Devdas was also admired by cine scholars for the appropriate use of ‚Äòflashback‚Äô, ‚Äòcloseup‚Äô, ‚Äòmontage‚Äô, ‚Äòwipe‚Äô,‚Äôdissolve‚Äô, and ‚Äòfade-in and fade-out‚Äô. Devdas is also considered a landmark in the world cinema for the introduction of technique of ‚Äòintercut telepathy shot‚Äô. Mukti was another bold film made by Pramathesh Barua. Mukti was the modern version of Devdas depicting the nostalgia of a man. The film was shot in the backdrop of scenic beauty of Assam. Rabindra Sangeet was first used successfully in the film. Pankaj Mallik also composed the music for one of the poems of Rabindranath Tagore, ‚ÄòDiner sheshe ghumer deshe‚Äô. Another important aspect of this film was that a major part of the film was shot outdoors. It took almost 2 decades after this film that realistic film-makers were more interested to shoot outdoors. In most of his previous films, Pramathesh Barua had a tragic hero. But, in 1939, he made a movie Rajat Jayanti that made people burst out with laughter. This film is considered to be the first Indian comedy talkie. In the same year, he made Adhikaar which ushered new thoughts in Indian cinema. His social criticism reached such an extent that the film advocated class struggle. The use of symbolism was highly admired. Pramathesh Barua also made brave attempt by trying to blend Indian classical music with Western symphony. Encouraged by him, Timirbaran performed the blending successfully which was thought to be nearly impossible. In 1940, Pramathesh Barua made Shapmukti for Krishna Movietone. Shapmukti greatly appealed to viewers tremendously for its highly tragic scenes. The film ended with 3 death sequences which Barua depicted with ‚Äòcut-shot‚Äô technique. Noted French film critic Geaorge Sadoul highly admired Pramathesh Barua for his brilliant use of ‚Äòcut-shot‚Äô technique which was also a pioneering effort in the early days of Indian cinema. His film Uttrayan which released in 1941 was also path-breaking film in its own right. Prior to this film, stories of Indian films would start after the credits. Although, Barua's breakthrough with New Theatres came with Devdas in 1935. The film was first made in Bengali, with Barua himself in the title role; he then remade it in Hindi as the 1936 film Devdas, with K.L. Saigal as the leading man. The Hindi version became a craze all throughout India; it cemented Barua as a top-notch director and Saigal as the top-notch hero of Indian films.The Devdas (Assamese) was Barua's last of three language versions. Barua followed up Devdas with Manzil in 1936, Mukti in 1937, Adhikar in 1938, Rajat Jayanti in 1939, and Zindagi (which reunited him with Saigal) in 1940. Phani Majumdar who later became a noted film director in his own right, started his film career with Barua at New Theatres. Barua's films were photographed by Bimal Roy, who would later become an accomplished director in his own right. Barua left New Theatres in 1939 and freelanced thereafter. However, of his post-New Theatres films, only Shesh Uttar/Jawab (1942) stood out. He planned an Indian version of The Way of All Flesh, but it never materialised. He took to drinking heavily, and his health began to decline; he died in 1951. ==Filmography== thumbtime=6:02 ===Director=== * Bengal 1983 (1932) * Roop Lekha/Mohabbat Ki Kasauti (1934) * Devdas (1935) * Maya (1936/II) * Maya (1936/I) * Manzil (1936) * Grihadah (1936) * Devdas (1936) * Devdas (1937) * Mukti (1937/II) * Mukti (1937/I) * Adhikar (1938) * Rajat Jayanti (1939) * Adhikar (1939) * Zindagi (1940) * Shap Mukti (1940) * Mayer Pran (1941) * Uttarayan (1941) * Jawab (1942) * Shesh Uttar (1942) * Rani (1943) * Chander Kalanka (1944) * Subah Shyam (1944) * Ameeree (1945) * Pehchan (1946) * Iran Ki Ek Raat (1949) * Maya Kanan (1953) ===Actor=== * 1.

That is, it contains small molecules that enter cells and serve as a molecular scaffolding in order to cause otherwise-misfolded mutant proteins to fold and route correctly within the cell. Mutation of proteins often causes molecular misfolding, which results in protein misrouting within the cell. Accordingly, mutant molecules may retain proper function but end up in parts of the cell where the function is inappropriate, or even deleterious, to cell function. Misfolded proteins are usually recognized by the quality-control system of the cell and retained (and often destroyed or recycled) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pharmacoperones correct the folding of misfolded proteins, allowing them to pass through the cell's quality-control system and become correctly routed. Since mutations often cause disease by causing misfolding and misrouting, pharmacoperones are potentially therapeutic agents, since they are able to correct this defect. Diseases that may be susceptible to such treatments include diabetes, inherited cataracts and cystic fibrosis. ==Examples== * Migalastat is a pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of Fabry disease. * In 2013, mice with a disease that makes the males unable to father offspring were cured by use of pharmacoperones. ==See also== *Enzyme replacement therapy ==References== ==Sources== *Conn, P.M. and Janovick, J.A., A New Understanding of Protein Mutation Unfolds, American Scientist 93:314-321, 2005.

In the first skirmish, also known as the Battle of Burr Oak Grove, on June 16, 1832, Illinois militia forces fought against a band of at least 80 of Native Americans. During the battle three militia men under the command of Adam W. Snyder were killed in action. The second battle occurred nine days later when a larger Sauk and Fox band, under the command of Black Hawk, attacked Major John Dement's detachment and killed five militia men. The second battle is known for playing a role in Abraham Lincoln's short career in the Illinois militia. He was part of a relief company sent to the grove on June 26 and he helped bury the dead. He made a statement about the incident years later which was recollected in Carl Sandburg's writing, among others. Sources conflict about who actually won the battle; it has been called a \\"rout\\" for both sides. The battle was the last on Illinois soil during the Black Hawk War. == Background == As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828. However, Sauk Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands. Angered by the loss of his birthplace, from 1830 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River, but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British, he again moved his so-called \\"British Band\\" of around 1000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois. Finding no allies he attempted to return to Iowa, but events overtook him and led to the Battle of Stillman's Run.\\"May 14: Black Hawk's Victory at the Battle of Stillman's Run,\\" Historic Diaries: The Black Hawk War, Wisconsin State Historical Society.

Major John Dement's battalion was ordered to the scene to protect settlers and ascertain the presence of Native Americans in the area, they were to report to Colonel Zachary Taylor at Dixon's Ferry. On June 22 Dement reached Dixon's Ferry where he reported to Taylor. Taylor then ordered him to cross the Rock River to take a position between Dixon's Ferry and Galena. Additionally, Taylor ordered Dement to set up his headquarters at Kellogg's Grove. With a command of 140 inexperienced men, Dement set out for the grove to replace a group of volunteers led by a Major Riley who had abandoned the fort on June 23. The troops that abandoned the fort had skirmished with the Native Americans two or three times and were defeated in all clashes, according to the soldiers stationed there.Autobiography of Ma-Ka- Tai-Me-She-Kia-Kiak, \\"Kellogg's Grove Fort .\\" Retrieved August 1, 2007.

The day before the second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, June 24, Black Hawk was leading his band in an attack on Apple River Fort. During the Battle of Apple River Fort the Sauk besieged the small stockade for much of the day. Other warriors were dispatched to gather food, horses and other supplies, all of which were badly needed by the band. The following day the group would reach Kellogg's Grove where they would engage Dement's militia forces. == Battles == === First Battle of Kellogg's Grove === The first Battle of Kellogg's Grove, or the Battle of Burr Oak Grove, occurred on June 16, 1832.

The next day, June 16, Snyder and his men pursued the Native Americans to the southwest; they came upon four natives and killed them. During the ensuing skirmish, Private William B. Mecomson was fatally wounded. The militia men put the wounded man on a litter and began to carry him back to the Kellogg cabin, along the way Mecomson asked that the group stop to rest. The group stopped and some of the men went for water while the rest waited with Mecomson.

The Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove occurred on June 25, 1832, after Major John Dement and his men, while camped at Kellogg's Grove on Sunday June 24, learned of a large group of Native Americans nearby. The battle pitted a large band of Native American warriors led by Black Hawk and his warchiefs Neapope and Weesheet against Dement's spy company of militia men. Dement's company had been searching the area for bands of warriors sent out by Black Hawk and their trail had led to Kellogg's Grove. During the night, three of the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men went in search of the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves appeared in the distance.Dement, John. \\"Report of the Battle at Kellogg's Grove,\\" Historic Diaries: Black Hawk War, June 25: The Battle of Kellogg's Grove, Wisconsin Historical Society.

The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times during the course of the war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn. As the militia fell back, the three men who had set out in search of their horses returned and they too were killed by the Native American forces. The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle was the last of the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well. That night American reinforcements arrived under the command of General Alexander Posey, who chose not to pursue the attackers and instead reported the situation to Colonel Zachary Taylor. Black Hawk asserted later that had Posey chose to attack him and his warriors that the blow dealt Black Hawk's band would have been decisive and war-ending. In fact, Dement's opinion was that there were more Native Americans at Kellogg's Grove than at any other engagement during the war. The next day more reinforcements arrived when Captain Jacob Early's detachment reached the grove. == Lincoln's role == Abraham Lincoln's service during the Black Hawk War has been a source of discrepancies and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the second battle, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.\\"Stillman's Run Memorial,\\" Historic Places, Abraham Lincoln Online.

The men were initially buried in other spots around the grove but during the 1880s local farmers banded together to collect the remains of the Black Hawk War dead and inter them in one spot beneath a memorial. ==See also== * List of battles fought in Illinois == Notes == == References == * Hawk, Black, LeClaire, Antoine, interpreter; Patterson, J.

On the island where her mother was born, Claire meets an eccentric writer, Celia (Lynn Redgrave), who in flashbacks, relates her own story as a grief-stricken teenager in 1949. Celia‚ÄîSilly (Kirsten Dunst) in the flashbacks‚Äîis the next chosen victim of a Viking curse which was placed on the island centuries ago when their longship sank in the bay. The nature of the curse is such that a \\"chosen one\\" is born every fifty years, and they are destined to die at sea in order for the fish the island depends on to continue to return. During the flashbacks Silly discovers a list of past victims, and that she is the next. However, in the end Silly is not claimed by the sea, which instead takes her lover. The narrator says something to the effect of what better alternative to taking the chosen one than to take her lover instead, leaving her to bear the pain. As Celia tells her own story of love and loss, Claire eventually undergoes a catharsis and again plays the violin that she has not touched since her own loss. The final clips of the movie show a shoal of fish, which points to the fact that the fish do indeed return to the island. ===List of curse victims=== The following list is found by Silly in the \\"fish logs\\" of Ironbound Island, and noted again by Claire as she finds their gravestones. * 1609 January, William Fleming, 17 years, lost at sea * 1659 May, Anne Bell, aged 16, drowned * 1701 August, John Dunsworth, aged 16 yrs., drowned * 1750 March, Eliza Coolen, aged 18 yrs., lost at sea * 1799 December, Ezekiel Dempsey, 16 years, lost at sea * 1849 June, James M.

It is known only by a posterior half of a skull (devoid of its mandible) and some post-cranial bones found in the Bostobe Formation in rocks dated from the Upper Santonian-Lower Campanian boundary, at about 83.6 Ma (millions of years). Only one species is known, Aralosaurus tuberiferus, described by Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky in 1968. The genus name means Aral Sea lizard, because it was found to the northeast of the Aral Sea. The specific epithet tuberiferus means bearing a tuber because the posterior part of the nasal bone rises sharply in front of the orbits like an outgrowth. Aralosaurus was originally reconstituted with a nasal arch similar to that of North American Kritosaurus (a comparison based on a specimen now placed in the genus Gryposaurus). For many years, Aralosaurus was thus placed in the clade of the Hadrosaurinae. This classification was invalidated in 2004, following the re-examination of the skull of the animal which allowed to identify in Aralosaurus many typical characters of Lambeosaurinae. In particular, this study revealed that Aralosaurus had a hollow bony structure located far in front of the orbits, which communicated with the respiratory tract. This structure being broken at its base, its shape and size unfortunately remains undetermined. More recently, Aralosaurus has been identified as the most basal Lambeosaurinae, and placed with its close relative Canardia from the upper Maastrichtian of France in the new clade of Aralosaurini. ==Discovery== The partial skull of Aralosaurus was discovered in 1957 near the Shakh-Shakh locality during a Soviet expedition in central Kazakhstan (which at the time was part of the USSR). In addition to the skull (which lacks most of the snout and the entire mandible), the material also included isolated teeth and postcranial elements most often fragmentary (ulna, radius, femur, tibia, fibula, astragalus, metatarsals). The only complete elements were a humerus and a metatarsal. It is only in 1968 that Rozhdestvensky described and named the animal. He estimated the size of the skull at about 65 cm and the size of the animal at about 6.5 m long. As the cranial sutures are far from fusioned, this specimen was probably immature. At the time, Rozhdestvensky argued that the skull of Aralosaurus presented the greatest resemblance with the skull of Kritosaurus with the presence of a nasal arch in front of the orbits (the comparisons were based with specimens attributed today to Gryposaurus, not to Kritosaurus). So, the animal was classified among the Hadrosaurinae, which are hadrosaurs devoid of cranial crest or with a solid bony crest. In 2004, the skull of Aralosaurus was re-examined by Godedroit and colleagues, and according to them, the bone fragments identified by Rozhdestvensky as the middle part of the nasal arch and the posterior portion of the premaxilla seem to have been lost. These fragments were originally found isolated while the rest of the skull was articulated (including a posterior fragment of the nasal). So that it is no longer possible today to confirm the presence of a nasal arch in Aralosaurus. On the other hand, this study shows that Aralosaurus was not a gryposaur-like hadrosaurine, because the purported nasal boss was in fact a fragment of a hollow structure. Indeed, Godefroit and colleagues did not find any hadrosaurines diagnostic characters in Aralosaurus. On the contrary, the skull of Aralosaurus presents several features (in the maxilla, parietal, squamosal and especially the nasal) which indicates its inclusion among the Lambeosaurinae. Notably, the posterior fragment of the nasal, which is clearly articulated to the rest of the skull, rises just in front of the orbits and forming or participating to a hollow crest-like structure. As this structure is broken at its base, it is not possible to deduce its size and shape. However, in rostral view, the nasal is clearly hollow, it is deeply excavated rostrally by a broad groove that communicates directly with the ventral side of the posterior part of the bone. It is therefore clear that in Aralosaurus the nasal crest surrounded part of the respiratory system. The extension of the nasal cavity inside a hollow crest is typically a lambeosaurine feature, thus confirming the inclusion of Aralosaurus among them. Aralosaurus also exhibits several cranial characters which indicate that it was a basal member of the group. Although having a hollow nasal structure, the latter was located in front of the orbits, a primitive position in lambeosaurines. In the most advanced representatives of the group, the nasal migrates to a caudodorsal position because of the important development of the premaxillae in these forms. In addition, in more derived lambeosaurines, the skull roof is modified to form a fixation zone for the hollow crest, whereas in Aralosaurus the skull roof does not present any particular modification. The shape and the size of the crest-like structure of Aralosaurus is unknown. Unfortunately, the fragments that was previously interpreted as a part of a gryposaur-like nasal arch and could have helped to reconstruct the circumnarial region of Aralosaurus, have been lost. So, the discovery of more complete specimens is necessary for a better knowledge of the shape and the size of this hollow structure. ==Description== Aralosaurus had a low bulge in front of its eyes, like the Hadrosaurus. They could inflate it like a balloon to produce a bellowing noise, that may have been used for visual identification, to warn predators to stay away, or to attract mates. They cropped, twigs, leaves and flowering plants with their toothless beaks and chewed them with their back grinding teeth. They were similar to Maiasaura and may have cared for their young on communal nesting grounds and travelled in herds for protection. ==Phylogeny== The following cladogram was produced by Albert Prieto-M√°rquez and his colleagues in 2013, it shows the phylogeny of Lambeosaurinae. Aralosaurus is closely related to Canardia and both genera are included in the tribe of Aralosaurini, which are identified as the most basal members of Lambeosaurinae. ==Paleobiogeography== Aralosaurus lived about 20 million years before its close relative Canardia. The latter inhabited the Ibero- Armorican Island, which was the westernmost island of the Late Cretaceous European Archipelago. As no lambeosaurines were known in the rich localities of late Campanian and early Maastrichtian ages of the Ibero-Armorican Island, it was suggested that the descendants of Aralosaurus had to reach this island rather late, perhaps at the end of the early Maastrichtian or during the late Maastrichtian. The discovery later in Spain of numerous lambeosaurines remains in the highest levels of the lower Maastrichtian argues for the first hypothesis. This migration was probably carried out in several stages, firstly by temporary terrestrial links between the landmass of Western Asia and the eastern islands of the European archipelago, then between the different European islands up to the Ibero-Armorican Island. Canardia was a rather archaic form for its time and the Ibero-Armorican Island was perhaps an ultimate refuge for the Aralosaurini. ==Paleoecology== The sediments of the Bostobe Formation consist mainly of clays and sandstones, and correspond to floodplain and estuarine environments in a subtropical to tropical climate. These different biotopes were located on the west coast of the Asian continent of the time, on the edge of the ancient Turgai Sea which connected the Tethys to the Arctic Ocean. The shallow marine waters west of this fluvial coastal plain were the site of intense organic productivity due to upwelling conditions caused by strong winds from the mainland. These winds were also the cause of a significant aridification of the climate in this region during the Santonian and early Campanian, causing a change in the flora of angiosperms, with a rarefaction of broad-leaved forms and a proliferation of small and narrow-leaved species of the family Ulmaceae. Angiosperms accounted for 75% of the flora of these biotopes, the rest being conifers and rare ginkgos and cycads. The locality of Shakh Shakh, where Aralosaurus was found, yielded a diverse fauna including many fish (chondrichthyans, chondrosteans, and holosteans), Anura, at least six species of turtles some of which had a carapace at least 75 cm long, a scincomorph, crocodylians, pterosaurs (Aralazhdarcho), birds, mammals, and several undetermined dinosaur species (Ankylosauridae, Sauropoda, Tyrannosauroidea, Ornithomimidae, Therizinosauroidea, Troodontidae, and Dromaeosauridae). Elsewhere in this formation, the site of Akkurgan is distinguished by the presence of the two basal hadrosauroids Arstanosaurus and Batyrosaurus, as well as the pterosaur Samrukia (whose jaw was first attributed to an Caenagnathid oviraptorosaur, then to a giant bird), which could be a junior synonym of Aralazhdarcho. ==See also== * Timeline of hadrosaur research ==References== Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of Asia Category:Lambeosaurines Category:Fossil taxa described in 1968 Category:Taxa named by Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky ","title":"Aralosaurus"},{"id":"3259876","text":"Ruediger Schleicher R√ºdiger Schleicher (14 January 1895 - 23 April 1945) was a German legal academic and resistance fighter against the Nazi r√©gime. ==Life== Born in Stuttgart, W√ºrttemberg, Schleicher was married to Ursula Bonhoeffer (1902-1983), Karl Bonhoeffer's daughter and Dietrich and Klaus Bonhoeffer's sister. His daughter Renate married Dietrich Bonhoeffer's friend and fellow theologian, Eberhard Bethge. Schleicher studied law in T√ºbingen and obtained his doctorate in 1923 with a dissertation on \\"International Air Travel Law.\\" After working in the W√ºrttemberg government service and the German-American Arbitration Committee at the Foreign Office in Berlin, he became an official in the Reich Ministry of Transport in 1927. Upon the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, he was posted to the newly established Ministry of Aviation under Hermann G√∂ring. There, beginning in 1935, he headed the legal department as a ministerial adviser. On 14 August 1939, less than three weeks before the war broke out, Schleicher was removed as leader of the legal department and given a job as a consultant in the General Air Office. His advocacy, in publications and presentations, of international law, the war renunciation pact (Kellogg- Briand Pact, 1928), and the Hague Conventions did not sit well with the government. In 1939, as an added responsibility, Schleicher took on the leadership of the Institute for Aviation Law at the Frederick William University of Berlin and the publication of the magazine Archiv f√ºr Luftrecht. The Institute was later used for conspiratorial resistance meetings. In the event that the revolt against Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944 was successfully accomplished, Schleicher was to be responsible for the reorganization of air travel. After the plot to assassinate the F√ºhrer at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia failed, Schleicher explained during interrogation that he opposed the Nazi r√©gime. To bring about reconciliation with Western war opponents, he said, Hitler had to step down. On 2 February 1945, Schleicher was sentenced to death by the People's Court (Volksgerichtshof). The presiding judge was Roland Freisler, who was killed in a US air raid the very next day. After several months in Gestapo custody, R√ºdiger Schleicher was shot on the night of 22‚Äì23 April, along with twelve fellow prisoners, among them his own brother-in-law Klaus Bonhoeffer and his assistant Hans John, by a special Reich Main Security Office squad on the former exhibition grounds near Lehrter Stra√üe prison in Moabit, as Red Army troops were already entering Berlin. Schleicher's commentary on the German Air Traffic Law (Luftverkehrsgesetz, 1. Aufl. 1933, 2. Aufl. 1937) was continued after his death (Schleicher/Reymann/Abraham, Das Recht der Luftfahrt, 3. Aufl. 1960/1966). ==Literature== * Bracher, Karl Dietrich: Geschichte als Erfahrung. Betrachtungen zum 20.

Licensed to St. Paul, Minnesota, United States, the station serves the greater St. Paul area. The station is currently owned by Macalester College and run by students. The station has held the WMCN call sign since July 30, 1979. ==History== This station was granted a final extension to its original construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission on June 20, 1979. The new station was assigned the call sign \\"KJAB\\" by the FCC but this was changed to the current WMCN on July 30, 1979. The station received its broadcast license from the FCC on April 1, 1980. ==Programming== Located in the Macalester-Groveland neighborhood, roughly between the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, WMCN is a low power station and has a broadcast radius of roughly 2.5 to 3 miles. The freeform programming is hosted by student disc jockeys and the station only operates during the school's terms. Students are required to complete training sessions to familiarize themselves with the station's music library, policies, and broadcast equipment before they are permitted on the air. WMCN provides Macalester and its surrounding community with music from various genres including rock, Americana, world, jazz, hip-hop, electronic, and classical as well as talk radio programming. Community activist Dan Richmond described WMCN as \\"one of the first places to look for new music and ideas\\". The station began an overhaul of its facilities in 2006, adding enhanced webcast capabilities and working towards the complete digitization of its music library. The digitization of nearly 20,000 songs was, after some complications, completed in late 2007 with the station announcing plans to sell off its vast CD library when the project was complete. ==Former on-air staff== While most student presenters at college radio stations do not pursue careers in broadcasting, some use the experience as a springboard to larger venues. Gregory Keltgen, now better known as \\"DJ Abilities\\", got his start as a hip hop DJ providing scratches as part of his older brother Derek's show on WMCN. Brian Bull, currently an award-winning business and economics reporter for WCPN 90.3 ideastream and contributing reporter for National Public Radio, got his first job in radio hosting a weekly classical music program on WMCN during his freshman year. Joanna Stein, a 2006 Macalester graduate and WMCN veteran, joined the staff of National Public Radio's Morning Edition program. Minneapolis/St. Paul community radio station KFAI announcer Jennifer Downham, host of Groove Garden since 1994, says she did not \\"pursue her musical interests until she became a radio DJ\\" on WMCN.

The film is named after \\"Gimme Shelter\\", the lead track from the group's 1969 album Let It Bleed. Gimme Shelter was screened out of competition as the opening film of the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. ==Context== The counterculture era documentary is associated with the Direct Cinema movement of the 1950s and 1960s. It was directed by The Maysles Brothers who are strong figures of the era.Dave Saunders, Direct Cinema: Observational Documentary and the Politics of the Sixties, Wallflower Press, 2007 The movement revolves around the philosophy of being a \\"reactive\\" filmmaker, recording events as they unfold naturally and spontaneously rather than investigating the subject matter through documentary techniques such as interviews, reconstruction and voiceover. ==Production== The film depicts some of the Madison Square Garden concert later featured on the 1970 live album, Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert, as well as Charlie Watts and a donkey filmed on the M6 motorway near Birmingham during a photography session for the album cover. It also shows the Stones at work in Muscle Shoals, Alabama recording \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\", and footage of Ike and Tina Turner opening for the Stones at their Madison Square Garden concert, to Mick Jagger's comment, \\"It's nice to have a chick occasionally\\". The Maysles brothers filmed the first concert of the tour at Madison Square Garden in New York City. After the concert, the Maysles brothers asked the Rolling Stones if they could film them on tour, and the band agreed. Much of the film chronicles the behind-the- scenes dealmaking that took place to make the free Altamont concert happen, including much footage of well-known attorney Melvin Belli negotiating by telephone with the management of the Altamont Speedway. The movie also includes a playback of Hells Angels leader Ralph \\"Sonny\\" Barger's famous call- in to radio station KSAN's \\"day after\\" program about the concert, wherein he recalls, \\"They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over.\\" ===Altamont Free Concert=== The focus then turns to the 1969 concert itself at the Altamont Speedway, the security for which was provided by the Hells Angels (armed with pool cues). As the day progresses, with drug-taking and drinking by the Angels and members of the audience, the mood turns ugly. Fights break out during performances by The Flying Burrito Brothers and Jefferson Airplane; Grace Slick pleads with the crowd to settle down. When Mick Jagger arrives to the grounds via helicopter, he is punched in the face by an unruly fan while making his way to his trailer. At one point Jefferson Airplane lead male singer Marty Balin is knocked out by a Hells Angel; Paul Kantner attempts to confront \\"the people who hit my lead singer\\" in response, announcing: \\"Hey, man, I'd like to mention that the Hells Angels just smashed Marty Balin in the face, and knocked him out for a bit. I'd like to thank you for that.\\" To which a Hells Angel sitting on stage grabs a microphone, and replies: \\"You're talking to my people. Let me tell you what's happening. You, man, you are what's happening!\\" Slick herself warns the Angels after they continue hitting people: \\"You don't hassle with anybody in particular. You gotta keep your bodies off each other unless you intend love. People get weird, and you need people like the Angels to keep people in line. But the Angels also-- You know, you don't bust people in the head for nothing. So both sides are fucking up temporarily; let's not keep fucking up!\\" Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesh arrive, but The Grateful Dead opt not to play after learning of the incident with Balin from Santana drummer Michael Shrieve. (Santana and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young also performed at the concert but are not shown in the movie.) The Stones are shown appearing onstage that evening and opening with \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\", and are also shown performing \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", as the tension continues to build. During the next song, \\"Under My Thumb\\", a member of the audience, 18-year-old Meredith Hunter, attempted, with other crowd members, to force his way onto the stage , and as a result was struck by the Hells Angels guarding the band. Hunter then drew a revolver before being attacked by Hells Angel Alan Passaro and killed by at least six stab wounds. Hunter's stabbing was captured on film by at least one of the many camera operators filming the documentary, and appeared in the final cut of the film. According to Albert Maysles, the stabbing was filmed by Baird Bryant; other sources have also credited Eric Saarinen. The film sequence clearly shows the dark silhouette of a handgun in Hunter's hand against the crocheted vest of his girlfriend, Patty Bredehoft, as Passaro enters from the right, grabs and raises Hunter's gun hand, turns Hunter around, and stabs him at least twice in the back before pushing Hunter off camera. The credited camera operators for Altamont included a young George Lucas. At the concert, Lucas' camera jammed after shooting about of film. None of his footage was incorporated into the final cut. ==Critical reception== As of 2020, the film holds a score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 ratings, with an average rating of 9.17/10.

During his playing days, Werth stood tall, weighing ; he batted and threw right-handed. While primarily a right fielder throughout his career, Werth also played left field for the Nationals. ==Background== Werth was born in Springfield, Illinois, the son of Jeff Gowan, a collegiate baseball and football player who broke all the receiving records and led all Division I wide receivers in receptions while at Illinois State University, and played outfield in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system in 1978 and Kim Schofield, who competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in the long jump and 100 meters. He is the grandson of Ducky Schofield and nephew of Dick Schofield, both Major League Baseball infielders, and stepson of Dennis Werth, who played in parts of four seasons with the Kansas City Royals and New York Yankees from 1979 through 1982. Werth is married with two children. ==Baseball career== ===Early career=== Werth was successful as a youngster, playing for the top youth traveling teams in Springfield, Illinois. His teams began traveling when he was seven and dominated the state of Illinois youth baseball with four consecutive state championships (never finishing worse than fourth in nationals) in Khoury League with the Bunn Brewers. He then played for a national power, the Springfield Flame, where his team won the state and Midwest Regional and finished third in the 1993 Sandy Koufax World Series in Spring, Texas, behind Pico Rivera, California and a Dallas, Texas, team that included future major leaguer Vernon Wells. Werth also was selected to play for the U.S. Junior Pan Am Games in 1995. He gained more attention while attending Glenwood High School in Chatham, Illinois, where he compiled a .616 batting average in his senior year with 15 home runs in 31 games and helped his team to the state championship in 1996 (his junior year). Werth was named to the 1997 All-America First Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings as a catcher. Werth initially planned on playing college baseball at the University of Georgia, but changed his plans when he was drafted in the first round (22nd overall) by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. In the minor leagues, Werth played catcher as his primary position. ===Toronto Blue Jays=== Prior to making his major- league debut, the Orioles traded Werth to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher John Bale. Werth broke into the major leagues with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2002. It was with Toronto when he began the switch to the outfield from catcher. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== On March 29, 2004, Werth was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jason Frasor after two seasons in Toronto. During spring training, on March 2, 2005, Werth was hit by a pitch from A. J. Burnett that broke his left wrist. Despite the injury, Werth was able to play in 102 games during 2005, hitting .234 with seven home runs (compared to 16 the previous year, in fewer at-bats). Eight months later, Werth underwent exploratory surgery which revealed two ligament tears that were repaired; however, his discomfort never subsided. On May 21, 2006, Werth had cortisone injected into his wrist; the wrist was placed in a cast for three to four weeks. These injuries caused him to miss the entire 2006 season. ===Philadelphia Phillies=== Jayson Werth batting On December 19, 2006, Werth signed a one-year, $850,000 contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. On June 28, 2007, Werth suffered another wrist injury, but returned August 2 against the Chicago Cubs and went 3-for-6, with 4 RBI and 1 stolen base. Jayson Werth at Wrigley Field during a 2007 game vs. the Cubs. In 2008, Werth began the season platooning with Geoff Jenkins in right field, but soon found himself playing every day in the early part of the season while regular center fielder Shane Victorino was on the disabled list.

He was introduced to the media on December 15, 2010 with his number 28 jersey. Werth had a difficult 2011, highlighted by a June in which he had a .154 batting average, a .291 on-base percentage, and a .286 slugging percentage. On the season, Werth had a .232 batting average, with 20 home runs and 58 runs batted in. On May 6, 2012, Werth broke his left wrist attempting to make a diving catch against his old team, the Philadelphia Phillies. The wrist was the same one that had caused him to miss much of the 2005 season and all of 2006. While the injury was described as a \\"clean break\\", it was reported that Werth would consult with the same wrist specialist who treated him in 2005, to determine whether there was any ligament damage. The next day, Werth underwent surgery on the left wrist. After a three-month absence for recuperation, Werth returned to the Nationals' lineup on August 2. Werth batted primarily in the leadoff spot for the first time in his career, posting a .309 batting average and .388 OBP in that role. On October 11, 2012, Werth, to conclude a 13-pitch at bat, hit a 9th inning walk-off home run off Lance Lynn of the St. Louis Cardinals in the bottom of the 9th inning to win the game, 2‚Äì1, and tie the National League Divisional Series at two games apiece. It was the longest at-bat to ever result in a game-ending postseason home run.https://www.espn.com/mlb/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8492596/jayson-werth- walk-home-run-saves-washington-nationals-season Werth finished the 2012 season with a .300 batting average, 5 homers, and 31 runs driven in in 81 games.

It marked the third time in his career that Werth had garnered MVP votes. On April 19, 2016, Werth hit 200th career home run in a game against the Miami Marlins. In 2016 he had the highest number of pitches per plate appearance in the major leagues (4.60). In 2016 Werth set a franchise record with a 46 on-base streak over a two-month period.https://www.federalbaseball.com/2016/8/20/12565920/an-autopsy-of- jayson-werth-46-game-on-base-streak Fouling a ball off his left foot in a June 3, 2017, game against the Oakland Athletics, Werth suffered a fractured first metatarsal bone as well as a bone bruise, which placed him on the disabled list.

It originally aired on the Fox Network in the United States on November 27, 2005. This episode was the second highest rated of the season with 11.5 million viewers. ==Plot== The Simpson children participate in the annual Easter celebration at Mayor Quimby's mansion. When Maggie is unable to gather any Easter eggs, Homer decides to take the other children's eggs. Maggie is delighted, but Hugs Bunny, who is refereeing the egg hunt, voices his immediate displeasure. Homer and Hugs get into a huge fight. Meanwhile, Marge goes on a tour of the mansion, led by Quimby's estranged wife, Martha Quimby, but things quickly go downhill when the fight spills into Quimby's office. Marge is embarrassed by Homer's childish actions, and her friends determine she is bad news and shun her. At home, Marge tells Homer exactly how she feels, and while Homer unsuccessfully tries to find some new friends for her, she meets some members of the Cheery Red Tomatoes while walking down a street. She quickly impresses the group's leader, Tammy (voiced by Lily Tomlin), and after participating in a few low-key meetings is soon invited to become a member of the women's group. However, when it comes time for the initiation, Tammy asks Marge to assist in their efforts to break into Burns's mansion to steal $1 million in Faberg√© eggs. They explain they are a group that raises funds for charity, and that Burns once promised them that amount to donate to a children's hospital; however, at a press conference, the selfish millionaire announced he would keep the money for a life-extending procedure for himself. Marge is reluctant to go ahead with the burglary, however bad of a person Burns is, but when told her membership rides on her participation, she agrees to cast her morals aside. At home, Homer finds Marge's Tomatoes folder lying around the house and after rummaging through it, learns about the group's plans to break into Burns's safe. As he tries to get to the mansion to stop her, his reckless driving gets the attention of the police, who follow him, after leaving Officer Eddie behind to direct traffic. Meanwhile, Marge is able to sneak onto Burns's grounds through an air duct and unlock a gate; from there, the women crack open the safe and begin helping themselves to the Faberg√© eggs that sit inside. As the women are leaving, Chief Wiggum and Burns arrive at the mansion to arrest the women. Homer arrives to stop Marge from doing something she might regret, but finds himself a prime suspect in the heist. However, once everything is explained, Marge realizes she does not need the group to make friends; after all, she already has one very special friend ‚Äì Homer. The group returns the eggs to Burns, but Marge later reveals that she hid one in her hair and gives it to them before departing. Meanwhile, Lisa is seeking summer opportunities and decides on studying abroad in Rome. After meeting with Principal Skinner about it, Lisa realizes that she meets all but one of the requirements: being fluent in Italian. She tries to convince Principal Skinner that she speaks Italian, but the principal is skeptical. Rather than putting her on the spot, he decides to test Lisa later. This gives Lisa time to hire a tutor, who shockingly turns out to be Milhouse; Milhouse explains that ever since he was a baby, he spends some time in Tuscany every summer with his grandmother, Sophia, who only spoke to him in Italian, as she hated English due to being left pregnant by an American G.I. after World War II, whom is his uncle \\"bastardo.\\" Milhouse is actually quite good at teaching Lisa, and before long, Lisa's speaking the language fluently and even develops a crush on Milhouse. However, just as it seems that Milhouse's unrequited feelings for Lisa are about to be reciprocated, she catches him with a girl named Angelica. This makes Lisa mad and she starts chasing him around while beating him up and cursing him in Italian, just like his grandmother did whenever he spoke in English to her. ==ReferencesCategory:The Simpsons (season 17) episodes Category:2005 American television episodes it:Episodi de I Simpson (diciassettesima stagione)#Le allegre comari di Rossor ","title":"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas"},{"id":"3259982","text":"Gottfried and Brigitte John in 2004 Gottfried John (;Unlike the common English name John, the German pronunciation begins with a \\"y\\" sound. 29 August 1942 ‚Äì 1 September 2014) was a German stage, screen, and voice actor. A long-time collaborator of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, John appeared in many of the filmmaker's projects between 1975 and his death in 1982, including Eight Hours Don't Make a Day, Mother K√ºsters Goes to Heaven, Despair, The Marriage of Maria Braun, and Berlin Alexanderplatz. His distinctive, gaunt appearance saw him frequently cast as villains, and he is best known to audiences for his role as the corrupt General Arkady Ourumov in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, and for his comedic turn as Julius Caesar in Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar, the latter for which he won the Bavarian Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. ==Early life== John was born in Berlin, Germany on 29 August 1942. In World War II he and his mother were evacuated to East Prussia; his father, whom he never met, was married to another woman. He grew up with his single parent mother and in several protectories; John fled from such a protectory when he was 15 years old and returned to his mother, who was living in Paris. In Paris he earned a living as a pavement artist and construction worker, and returned to Berlin in 1960. ==Career== During the 1970s and early 1980s, John was cast by director Rainer Werner Fassbinder in several of his projects, in particular as Reinhold in the Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) mini- series. He was internationally known for his portrayal of General Arkady Ourumov in the James Bond film GoldenEye and Julius Caesar in Asterix and Obelix take on Caesar. ==Personal life== John lived with his wife, Brigitte, in Utting am Ammersee from 2008 until his death in 2014. On 1 September 2014, it was announced that John had died in Utting am Ammersee near Munich, Germany of cancer at the age of 72. ==Works== ===Filmography=== * Caf√© Oriental (1962) (uncredited) * Das M√§dchen und der Staatsanwalt (1962) as Train passenger (uncredited) * Jaider, der einsame J√§ger (1971) as Jaider * Carlos (1971, TV Movie) as Carlos * Eight Hours Don't Make a Day (1972‚Äì1973, TV Series) as Jochen * World on a Wire (1973, TV Movie) as Einstein * Mother K√ºsters' Trip to Heaven (1975) as Niemeyer * Der Kommissar: Der Held des Tages (1976, TV series episode) as Werner Stimmel * Derrick: Das Superding (1976, TV series episode) as Krummbach * Und Rosa und Marilyn und ...

It is an account of the world (periegesis) in 'comic' iambic trimeters which is dedicated to a King Nicomedes of Bithynia. This is either Nicomedes II Epiphanes who reigned from 149 BC for an unknown number of years or his son, Nicomedes III Euergetes. The author explicitly takes for his model Apollodorus of Athens, whose chronography in trimeters was dedicated to King Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamum.Prologue, ll 19-21. ==Attribution of authorship== The Periodos to Nicomedes was first published at Augsburg in 1600. Because it was found together with the Epitomes of Marcianus of Heraclea it was first published under his name. Because this was clearly a mistake Lucas Holstenius and Isaac Vossius were the first to attribute it to Scymnus of Chios, a writer cited more than once by late grammarians as the author of a periegesis. It continued to pass under his name until 1846 when Augustus Meineke, in republishing the extant fragments, showed clearly that there were no grounds for ascribing them to that writer. The real work of Scymnus of Chios appears to have been in prose and the few statements cited from him are not in accordance with those of Pseudo-Scymnus. In 1955 Aubrey Diller determined that Pseudo-Scymnus was most likely Pausanias of Damascus. If this is true, he would have lived in Bithynia around 100 BC. In 2004 Konstantin Boshnakov argued for Semos of Delos, and consequently for a somewhat later date than is usually offered. ==Content of the Periodos to Nicomedes== The standard text, with a French translation, is now Didier Marcotte, Pseudo-Scymnos, Circuit de la terre (Paris, 2000). The work contains material on the coasts of Spain, Liguria, the Euxine (Black Sea), data on various Greek colonies, as well as information about the ancient Umbrians, Celts, Liburnians and other peoples. ==References== ==Further reading== *Pseudo Scymnus or Pausanias of Damascus, Circuit of the Earth unedited English translation by Brady Kiesling * Category:Ancient Greek geographers Category:Ancient Greek pseudepigrapha Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Pseudo-Scymnus"},{"id":"3260002","text":"Dewlish Liberty was a liberty in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: *Dewlish *Milborne St Andrew (part) ==See also== *List of liberties in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A D, 1977, 1980, 1989: Place Names of Dorset, parts 1‚Äì3.

Its soundtrack was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The game was released in five different regions (British Isles, North America, France, Scandinavia, and Australasia), using three different retail covers. The game places the player as a nameless main character, for whom the player can enter a name at the start of the game, into a hub-and- spoke Disney park heavily based on the company's Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, and Tokyo Disneyland parks. Goofy left the golden key for the castle gate inside, and Mickey Mouse asks for the player's help to find six silver keys needed to open the Cinderella Castle gate and allow the Disney parade to begin. After completing this task, Mickey congratulates the player and the parade begins. ==Gameplay== Playing the Haunted Mansion level. The player must complete five different stages, modeled after rides in Disney theme parks, as well as a trivia quest in order to retrieve the set of keys. The player chooses which stage to play by walking around the park in the game's overworld map. The game features two vehicle stages with a top-down perspective. One of these stages is based on the Autopia ride and is a driving game in which the player must avoid various obstacles in a race against the villainous Panhandle Pete. The second, based on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad has the player controlling a train on a track and having to choose the right path to take while avoiding obstacles. There are also two side scrolling stages. In the Haunted Mansion stage, the player must defeat ghosts by throwing candles at them to retrieve one of the keys. The other side-scrolling stage is based on Pirates of the Caribbean and the player must rescue six villagers from pirates who have raided an island. The Space Mountain stage is a first-person stage in which the player boards a spaceship with the mission to reach a certain star, maneuvering through asteroids while shooting enemy ships with a phaser. The trivia game is available to play at any time. Several children around the park ask the player questions about Disney films and characters; if these are answered correctly, the children will reveal the location of the final silver key. ==See also== *List of Disney video games ==External links== *Disney Adventures in the Magic Kingdom at MobyGames *Adventures In The Magic Kingdom Prototype http://www.nintendoplayer.com/magickingdom/prototype.htm *Interview with Producer: Darlene Lacey http://www.nintendoplayer.com/interview/former- disney-game-producer-darlene-lacey/ Category:1990 video games Category:Disney games by Capcom Category:Magic Kingdom Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Pirates of the Caribbean video games Category:The Haunted Mansion video games Category:Video games based on Walt Disney Parks and Resorts attractions Category:Video games set in Orlando, Florida Category:Walt Disney World in fiction Category:Video games scored by Yoko Shimomura Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in amusement parks ","title":"Adventures in the Magic Kingdom"},{"id":"3260016","text":"This is an incomplete list of notable Jewish American philosophers.

Approximately 40% will also have bronchiectasis. It is also associated with chronic sinusitis and persistent coughing. It usually affects adults.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . ==Signs and symptoms== The nails are markedly thickened with yellow to yellow-green discoloration of the nails. They grow slowly, at a rate of 0.25 mm/week or less. The nails may have ridges and increased side-to-side curvature, reduction of the white crescent and detachment of the nail from the nailbed. These nail abnormalities may also change over time. Most people with yellow nail syndrome (four fifths) have lymphedema; it is symmetrical and typically affects both legs. It is the first symptom of the condition in about a third. Involvement of the arms and face is more unusual, as is lymphedema of the abdomen with ascites (fluid collection in the abdominal cavity) and fluid collection around the heart. Various lung problems can occur in people with yellow nail syndrome. Many experience cough and shortness of breath. Forty percent of cases develop pleural effusions, which are collections of fluid in the pleural cavity (the space that contains the lungs and normally only has a minimal amount of fluid in it). About half of all people with yellow nail syndrome have either recurrent chest infections or a chronic lung condition known as bronchiectasis which causes chronic production of sputum with episodes of worsening. Forty percent of people with yellow nail syndrome have chronic sinusitis. Yellow nail syndrome has been associated with some drugs, e.g. penicillamine, bucillamine and gold sodium thiomalate. It has also been associated with exposure to titanium from dental implants. ==Genetics== Although it has been described in families, it has been suggested that it might not have a genetic link. ==Diagnosis== The diagnosis is based on the combination of the symptoms. Generally, people are diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome if they have two or three of the three classical symptoms (yellow nails, lymphedema and pleural effusion). The nail changes are considered essential for the diagnosis, but they can be subtle. Pulmonary function testing can show obstruction of the airways. People with pleural effusions may show evidence of restriction in lung volumes due to the fluid. Analysis of the fluid in pleural effusions generally shows high levels of protein but low levels of cholesterol and lactate dehydrogenase, but about 30% of effusions are chylous (chylothorax) in that they have the characteristics of lymph. A lymphogram may be performed in people with lymphedema. This can show both under developed (hypoplastic) lymphatic ducts and dilated ducts. Dye may be found in the skin months after the initial test. Scintigraphy of lymph flow (lymphoscintigraphy) shows delays in drainage of lymph (sometimes asymmetrically), although this test can also be normal. ==Treatment== Normal treatment for swelling and any respiratory problems is appropriate.

The plot has Ross (David Schwimmer) tell girlfriend Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) the titular fantasy. In subplots, Monica (Courteney Cox) tries to get over her break-up with Richard with the help of Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), while Joey (Matt LeBlanc) has to cope with Chandler's (Matthew Perry) annoying girlfriend Janice being around. The episode was directed by Gail Mancuso, written by Michael Curtis and Gregory S. Malins and guest stars Maggie Wheeler as Janice and Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles in cameos as Jack and Judy Geller. ==Plot== At Rachel's request, Ross tells her one of his sexual fantasies: the scene from Return of the Jedi, where Princess Leia is in the gold bikini. He then gets upset when he finds out Rachel told Phoebe about the fantasy. Rachel tells Ross that girls tell each other everything, and she is surprised that guys do not do the same. He and Chandler later decide to try it, but Chandler overshares when he reveals that sometimes he sees his mother's face when he is with a woman. Ross gets back at Chandler by sharing this news to Joey, who reveals to Chandler that he always pictures Chandler's mom when he is having sex, much to his embarrassment. Rachel borrows a gold bikini outfit much like Princess Leia's to fulfill Ross's fantasy but, thanks to Chandler, Ross cannot stop picturing his own mother. Joey is annoyed to learn that Chandler has resumed his relationship with Janice and has no intention of breaking up with her this time. When Chandler buys tickets to the Rangers for the three of them, he confiscates the tickets because Joey cannot stand Janice, which is now a problem for Chandler as he is now crazy about her. Janice decides what Joey needs to get over his intense dislike of her is some bonding time and the two spend the day together. At the end of the day, Joey still cannot stand Janice but he tells Chandler he can now tolerate being in the same room as her, much to his relief. Monica tries to get over her breakup with Richard but she has not slept for three days and keeps finding things and going to places that remind her of their relationship. Phoebe tries to help her relax, but with minimal success. After she breaks down in tears at the post office her father comes to comfort her. He reveals that Richard is also suffering as a result of the breakup, worse than his divorce. The fact that Richard misses her too is enough for Monica to finally fall asleep. ==Reception== Entertainment Weekly rated the episode B+, positively reacting to the scenes in which Joey plays along with Wheel of Fortune and Ross learns women tell each other everything, calling the latter \\"a relatable, comedically rich concept\\". The Monica subplot is not so well received, with EW calling it \\"a drag\\". The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends describe it as \\"a pretty low-key opening to the season ... compared to season two's opener\\" and see the episode as the starting point for the season's \\"descent into soap opera\\". The producers received a letter of appraisal from George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, who congratulated them on the \\"great\\" Princess Leia fantasy. ==References== ==External links== *\\"The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy\\" at the Internet Movie Database Category:Friends (season 3) episodes Category:1996 American television episodes ","title":"The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy"},{"id":"3260046","text":"Fordington Liberty was a liberty in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: * Fordington * Hermitage * Minterne Magna (part) * Stockland (part) (i.e. Dalwood, transferred to Devon 1844) ==See also== * List of liberties in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A D, 1977, 1980, 1989: Place Names of Dorset, parts 1‚Äì3.

The Galician Government, Parliament and High Court of Galicia are regulated by it. ==Genesis of the 1981 Statute== The Statute passed in 1981 has its precedent in the Statute that had been drafted and voted in 1936. This earlier Statute could not be implemented due to the Spanish coup of July 1936 and the Spanish Civil War, which started in 1936. Hence, with the end of Francoist Spain in 1977, a process of devolution began in the Spanish State. This political and administrative process took form in the passing of the Statutes of Autonomy, regulated by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. On 16 March 1979, Galicia attained the rank of \\"pre-autonomous community\\", and in June 1979 Galician members to the Spanish Parliament submitted a draft for a Statute of Autonomy. Once the Constitutional Committee and the Spanish Parliamentary Assembly altered this first draft, it was finally ratified by the Galician people in a referendum held in December 1980. It came into effect on 6 April 1981 after being signed by King Juan Carlos I of Spain and by Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, President of the Spanish government, in the Spanish Royal Palace. Galicia then became an autonomous community. However, this new Statute soon came under intense criticism as it was considered not sufficiently ambitious. The 1981 Statute was not initially supported by Galician nationalist parties since they considered it \\"limited\\" compared to the 1936 one.Hooper (1986) For example, the 1936 statute endorsed Galicia with control over the economy and taxes, and also with the unique power to nationalize, rights not contemplated in 1981, among others. Nevertheless, the 1981 statute formed the cornerstone of future Galician political evolution, despite it being an end in itself for some and a point of departure for others. ==Powers endorsed by the Statute== The 1981 Statute of Autonomy recognises Galicia as a historical nationality, a cultural and geographical unit entitled to self-government in democracy. The Statute recognises Galicia the following specific powers, abilities and competencies (among others): * The organisation of the self-government institutions * The regulation of Galician national symbols: flag, anthem and coat of arms * The creation of new municipalities and territorial adjustments in existing ones. The establishment of the comarca (region) and the parroquia (parish) as official administrative territorial tiers * The development of policies for territorial management, urban management and housing * The planning and development of public works * The management of railways and roads whose infrastructures entirely belong to the autonomous community * The management of harbours, heliports and recreational airports and, in general, those not involved in commercial activities * The implementation of policies in relation to agriculture and farming, in accordance with the State's general law of economy * The management of forestry and the development and exploitation of public land * Management of the environment and protection of nature * Projects relating to the construction and management of irrigation activities involving the upkeep of channels, hydraulic functions and mineral and thermal waters * Legal regulation of fishing in inland waters, fisheries, hunting, river fishing and shellfish exploitation * The regulation, promotion and management of festivals, fairs and markets * The promotion of the economic development of the Autonomous Community within the objectives established in the national economic policy * The protection, promotion and management of handicraft and fine arts * The management of museums, libraries and music schools * Heritage management * The promotion of culture, research and investigation. The Galician government has the right and obligation to use and promote the Galician language at all levels * Promotion of sport and management of sporting and leisure activities * Social assistance (social work) * The management of the health system. Management of sanitary and hygiene services and infrastructures * Surveillance and protection of buildings and installations * The right to create an independent police force * The control and management of foundations and co-operatives, casinos and gambling, trade centres for goods and asset values, and fishing associations * Competencies regarding environmental management, landscape and nature protection * Competencies regarding forestry and woodland use and management, as well as the management of inland waters * Control and protection of the Galician coast (except for international issues) * Galicia has its own institute of statistics and a number of other official scientific institutes, regulated by law * The Galician government has almost exclusive competencies on education at all levels (schools and universities), and cultural issues in general * The regulation of advertising and publicity * Galicia has its own public radio and television broadcasting company (CRTVG), regulated by law * The Galician government regulates pharmaceutical services * The Galician government has extended competencies in the management of fishing harbours, the fishing sector, sea rescue, mines and energy exploitation * Industrial and intellectual property is responsibility of the Galician Government * The Galician government has additional competencies in public finance, taxes, and management of the economy and internal market, in accordance with the general regulations of the Spanish state.Galician public expenditure is controlled by the Consello de Contas (in Galician and Spanish) * The Galician government has the right to create, modify and implement its own legal system, in accordance with the general regulations of the Spanish state. This is officially known as the Galician Civil Code (noted in Art. 27, fourth point, of the statute of autonomy) * The Galician government has full powers in tourism management and promotion. Some of these rights and powers have not been exercised, or not fully. Some other have. Still, the Galician government is entitled to request the transfer of further competencies to the Spanish Parliament by means of an organic law. In this fashion, Galicia gains further powers slowly but gradually. Still, certain issues are reserved for the Spanish government only as specified by the Spanish Constitution (1978). These include the military and international relations. Likewise, the right for self-determination (claimed by nationalist groups) is not recognised either. ==Reform of the Statute== With the establishment of the new Galician government following the elections of 2005, debates were initiated in the Parliament on a possible reform of the Statute. Indeed, reform of the Statute and further devolution had been on the agenda of the new parties in government: the Galician Socialist Party and, namely, the Galician Nationalist Bloc. A consensus was sought with the third party in the chamber, the PPdeG. Yet, it was mentioned that the new Statute should recognise Galicia not just as an historical nationality, but as a nation. This issue was frontally rejected by the PPdeG and therefore conversations were put on hold. Although there is a still a parliamentary commission working on the development of a draft for a new Statute,Parliamentary site on the Statute form .

Kodandarami Reddy. Madhavi was the heroine. The film is loosely based on the 1982 film First Blood. Later, this movie has brought big name to Chiranjeevi and he made Khaidi No. 786 as his 100th movie and his 150th movie was Khaidi No. 150, thus making up his Khaidi trilogy. Released on 28 October 1983, the film was a massive commercial success by which Chiranjeevi rose to stardom. == Plot == Veerabhadraiah (Raogopal Rao) is a feudal lord presiding over a village along with his henchmen, which include his assistant (Rallapalli) and the village sarpanch (Nutan Prasad). Veerabhadraiah lends money to Venkateswarlu (P. L. Narayana), who is a local farmer living with his widowed daughter (Sangeetha). His son, Suryam (Chiranjeevi) is a hard working student living in the nearby city and he falls in love with Veerabhadraiah's daughter - Madhulatha (Madhavi). Realising this, Veerabhadraiah asks Venkateswarlu to ask his son to stop seeing his daughter, to which Venkateswarlu does not agree. Veerabhadraiah kills Venkateswarlu and asks Suryam to pay the money which he had given as a loan. Suryam asks for some time and with the help of his elder sister raises crops to repay. Just as the crops are ready for harvest, Veerabhadraiah and his henchmen not only destroy the crop but also try to sexually abuse Suryam's sister, during which she commits suicide. Being the village head, Veerabhadraiah implicates Suryam in the death of his sister, saying that he was forcing her into prostitution, due to which his sister committed suicide. Suryam is arrested by the Police. The rest of the movie deals with how Suryam escapes from jail and with the help of Dr. Sujatha (Sumalatha) he avenges the decimation of his family. == Cast == * Chiranjeevi as Suryam * Madhavi as Madhulatha * Rao Gopal Rao as Veerabhadraiah * Sumalatha as Dr. Sujatha * Nutan Prasad as Munsiff * Rallapalli as Sarma * Ranganath as Police Inspector Dinesh * Chalapati Rao as Forest Officer * P.

Tirupathi Reddy: \\"Kodandarami Reddy also hails from the same place of ours, and we thought of doing a film together and worked on a couple of subjects in Chiranjeevi and Kodandarami Reddy combination. However, I liked the subject of First Blood, and I asked Paruchuri brothers to come up with a story based on that film. They gave a wonderful script for the film. ...The protagonist was just a villager in our initial script, but we changed it to a student, and it clicked! The title Khaidi was my choice indeed!\\" \\"Madhavi and Chiranjeevi were a hit pair, but Madhavi didn't work with Kondadarami Reddy before and thus I wanted to cast her in the film. Nitya already acted in a Tamil film. I liked her character in the film and we signed her in for the bubbly character of Rosy. Our banner name being Samyuktha, we rechristened Nitya as Samyuktha, and she continued to do more films, such as Sirivennela under the same name.\\" \\"The film's shooting was started at Prasad Labs on 30 April 1983, with the muhurtam shot on Chiranjeevi and Madhavi. (It was the continuation scene of Menaka-Vishwamitra song \\"Vedam, naadam...\\", where Madhavi asks Chiranjeevi about their love). The film was completed in three schedules. The number of shooting days were forty; forty film rolls were exposed for the movie.\\" \\"The movie was sold for 2.5 million rupees even when we just announced it! Chiranjeevi was paid Rs., Madhavi Rs. 40,000, Sumalatha Rs. 20,000, and the director Kondarami Reddy was paid Rs. 40,000 too. As we wanted to make the film a very prestigious one, we spent all our money and we had not made much profit in the film's first run. As the film's rights were sold once every five years to exhibitors, we made profit on this film after five years and through the following years. After five years, we made a profit of 2 million rupees, and some more during the subsequent years. We have not made much profit on satellite rights as we were not aware that it would boom so much today.\\" \\"Most of the shooting was done in the village called Rebala near Nellore, while the climax was shot at Porur near Madras. The blasting of houses, and some other such scenes were done there at a specially erected set. The house set, indoors and minor patchwork of shooting was done in Madras. Madhavi, being a lady artiste, had an exclusive house in Talakona location, while everyone else adjusted in huts and houses in and around the village.\\" \\"The now famous costume of Chiranjeevi was his own idea! We first thought of doing it ordinarily, but he wanted the getup to be somewhat different. In the last minute, he got a black trouser and black T-shirt from the house, took off the sleeves of the shirt and had the belt above the T-shirt. The getup clicked so much that he became a Khaidi in the hearts of lakhs of audiences with this movie.\\" Director Kodandarami Reddy talks about the film: \\"We initially planned the film with the story given by a Tamil writer, but it didn't work out. Tirupathi Reddy gaaru then gave the cassette of First Blood and suggested that we should develop the story based on the initial scenes of the movie. Paruchuri brothers gave wonderful story based on it. ...In those times, we never used to think that it could be risky to go out of the way to do something different! We always wanted to experiment on various things. The songs \\"Ragulutondi mogalipoda...\\" and \\"Idemitabbaa...?\\" were super hits at that time, because we did them differently! This was the first film of Chiranjeevi that crossed the ten million mark in collections, thus also giving him the star status. ==Soundtrack== The Music Was Composed By K. Chakravarthy and Released by Tips Music. All Lyrics were penned by Veturi Sundararama Murthy. ==Remakes== The film was later remade in Kannada and in Hindi too.

Popular logic mazes include tilt mazes and other novel designs which usually increase the complexity of the maze, sometimes to the point that the maze has to be designed by a program to eliminate multiple paths. ==History== Robert Abbott invented the logic maze.

It originally appeared as an arcade game in 1990. It gained considerable attention for its live-action video style, bearing similarities to contemporary Hollywood westerns. ==Storyline== The player assumes the first-person role of the game's silent protagonist, a nameless individual addressed only as \\"stranger\\". The stranger rides into an unnamed Old West town and is approached by an elderly prospector (Ben Zeller), who appeals to him for help. He tells the stranger that the mayor and his daughter have been kidnapped by a gang of outlaws led by the notorious \\"Mad Dog\\" McCree (Rusty Dillon), and when the sheriff tried to stop them, they locked him up in the jail. Two of the gang appear to silence the prospector, but the stranger shoots them. The prospector then tells him that One-Eyed Jack holds the keys to the jail, and is in the saloon. For the remainder of the game, the exact order of events depends on the player's decisions. The stranger enters the saloon, where One-Eyed Jack and his cohorts are making trouble. The stranger defeats them and takes the jail keys. He visits the jail and frees the sheriff. The stranger and sheriff set out to stop Mad Dog, but are ambushed by three of his gang outside the jail. They defeat them, but the sheriff is fatally shot. With his dying breaths, he tells the stranger that the map to Mad Dog's hideout is hidden in the local mine, and that he should consult the prospector before going there. The stranger sees that the bank is being robbed by Mad Dog's men. After he stops the robbery, a thankful boy advises him not to enter Mad Dog's hideout from the back entrance (sometimes, he'll advise not to take the front entrance). He finds the prospector has been tied up to a pile of live explosives by Mad Dog himself, and saves him by severing the fuse. After finding the map in the mine, the stranger follows the path to the hideout. He shoots out the smokestack, forcing Mad Dog's gang out as the hideout floods with smoke. He shoots them down as they come out and saves the mayor. However, McCree himself has escaped with the mayor's daughter, leaving behind a taunting note for the stranger. The stranger confronts Mad Dog in a final quick-draw showdown. Forewarned that Mad Dog wears a bulletproof vest, the stranger defeats him by shooting both his hands. The mayor then unties his daughter. As the townsfolk congratulate the stranger, Mad Dog recovers, and is seen riding a horse off into the distance. ==Gameplay== In a series of stages, the player must shoot enemies before they fire, avoid shooting innocent bystanders, and reload each time their six-round revolver is depleted of bullets. Shooting a bystander or getting hit by a gunfighter results in the loss of one life out of three and is followed by a clip showing the town doctor commenting on the player's actions. However, this traditional light gun shooter gameplay is interspersed with \\"showdowns\\", which are fast draw duels that play the same as American Laser Games's later release Fast Draw Showdown. The arcade version is equipped with a specialized light gun which can detect whether or not the player had properly lowered the light gun at the beginning of the duel. Home versions of the game attempted to simulate this mechanic by having the player's gun unloaded at the beginning of the duel, and not allowing it to be reloaded until the same moment when the arcade version would allow the player to draw. The home versions allow the player to choose from three difficulty modes. ==Development== Mad Dog McCree was the first title released by American Laser Games, a company which was born out of the founders' previous venture of producing police training simulators. American Laser Games filmed all the footage for the game in its home state, New Mexico, and used local actors to fill all the roles. Local rancher Russ Dillen played various outlaws in the game including the titular Mad Dog, for which he had to dye his natural blonde hair black. His wife Lori played the saloon barfly. Ben Zeller, who plays the prospector, went on to have major roles in two further American Laser Games productions, Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold and Space Pirates. Carol Eason, who plays the undertaker, also reprised his role in Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold. ==Release== The arcade edition of the game has been released with four different hardware setups, using a laserdisc player as well as a Commodore Amiga 500 motherboard with special interfaces for controls and booting, and a genlock. Home versions were released for the Sega CD, CD-i, 3DO, and Microsoft Windows. A port for the Atari Jaguar CD was announced in 1994 and reportedly in development but it was never released. Mad Dog McCree was the first in a series of American Laser Games releases to be reissued by Digital Leisure with updated video and sound quality in 2001 for DVD, playable with a standard DVD remote. In 2009 the game was released for the Nintendo Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree: Gunslinger Pack. Included in this collection are its sequel Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold and The Last Bounty Hunter. In 2011, it was released for iOS. On June 14, 2012, it was released on the Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS.\\"Mad Dog McCree Takes Aim at eShop on 14th June\\" , retrieved June 3rd, 2012. Sony revealed on January 21, 2013 that the game would be released for PlayStation 3 the following day. The PlayStation 3 version features remastered video presented in 720p and a new interface. ==Sequel== A sequel was released entitled Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold. ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed Mad Dog McCree on their August 15, 1992 as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. The original arcade game was praised by GamePro for its amusing cowboy stereotypes. Reviews of the 3DO panned long delays between shots and outcome video that affected gameplay experience, and having to use the gamepad as a control for the gun cursor, especially when the 3DO Gamegun was yet to be released. An Edge review noted collision detections, and comments on the console's video quality by reviews ranged from \\"tolerable\\" to poor. Reviewing the Sega CD version, GamePro noted that the video is so grainy that the manual diagrams one of the levels because the important items in it are indiscernible. GamePro nonetheless assessed it as the best home version of the game to date, due to the ability to play it with a light gun. The magazine was much more approving of the later CD-i version due to the high quality live action video and the bundled Peacekeeper Revolver, commenting that \\"This slick-looking revolver handles well and sports a hair trigger that'll make a Dirty Harry out of anyone.\\" In April 1994 Computer Gaming World said that the DOS version \\"brings exciting action to PC compatibles ... there's plenty for the sheriff to do\\". == Notes == ==References== == External links == * Mad Dog McCree at GameFAQs * Mad Dog McCree at Giant Bomb * Mad Dog McCree at Killer List of Videogames * Mad Dog McCree at MobyGames Category:1990 video games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:Arcade games Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:CD-i games Category:DVD interactive technology Category:Full motion video based games Category:Interactive movie video games Category:IOS games Category:LaserDisc video games Category:Light gun games Category:Majesco Entertainment games Category:Menacer Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Rail shooters Category:Sega CD games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Western (genre) video games Category:Wii games Category:Wii Zapper games Category:Windows games ","title":"Mad Dog McCree"},{"id":"3260084","text":"This is a list of notable Jewish American chemists.

The game was the launch title for the system and was included as a pack-in game with Panasonic's original 3DO console. == Gameplay == Gameplay screenshot. In Crash 'n Burn, players assume the role of any one of six cyberpunks, each equipped with a unique car and a deadly supply of weapons. Full-motion videos of the racers are accessible in between races, in which each character flaunt their skills and insult their opponents with death threats. The game has rally and tournament modes with a total of 30 tracks designed for one player.Crash 'n Burn manual (3DO Interactive Multiplayer, US) == Synopsis == The game is set in the year 2044 AD. == Development and release == Crash 'n Burn was developed as a launch title for the 3DO. Crystal Dynamics was formed on 8 July 1992 by Sega veterans Judy Lang, Madeline Canepa, and Dave Morse. Crystal was the first licensed developer for 3DO, a gaming hardware platform simultaneously funded by Kleiner Perkins. Mark Cerny joined the company, but he left to work for Universal Interactive Studios. In 1993, Strauss Zelnick, president of 20th Century Fox's film studio, was hired to run Crystal Dynamics. This made national news and helped to touch off the frenzy of multimedia investments of the mid-1990s. A 1993 editorial in Electronic Gaming Monthly declared that \\"the hottest new video game company on the upscale scene is definitely Crystal Dynamics.\\" Crash 'n Burn was conceived and produced by Mark Wallace and developed by Crystal Dynamics, with Bill Mitchell and Bill Willis as lead programmers and Mark Cerny as designer. Its development team required a small number of artists, including Steve Kongsle. The project was directed by David Burke and E. Daniel Arey was responsible for writing the script used for the product. Burke Trieschmann acted as a composer for the game's score. The launch of the 3DO in October 1993 received a great deal of attention in the press as part of the \\"multimedia wave\\" in the computer world at the time. Return Fire, Road Rash, FIFA International Soccer and Jurassic Park Interactive had been slated for launch releases but were pushed to mid-1994 due to the developers' struggles with the sophisticated hardware. The 3DO Company also made continued updates to the console hardware almost up to the system's release, which resulted in a number of third-party titles missing the launch date and in some cases by less than a month, because the developers were not left enough time to fully test them on the finalized hardware. Its only software available at launch was Crash 'n Burn. Panasonic also failed to manufacture an ample supply of the console in time for launch day, and as a result most retail stores only received one or two units. By mid-November, it had sold 30,000 units. In an interview shortly after The 3DO Company dropped support for the system, Trip Hawkins pointed out that it was essentially a lack of coordination between the company, Panasonic and the console's software developers which had led to it launching with only one game ready. == Reception == Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 7 out of 10. They described it as \\"a complex and exciting game once you get into [it]\\", but felt that it was not a strong enough game to sell a system as expensive as the 3DO. GamePro praised the game as having the best racing game graphics ever seen in a home system, and also complimented the striking cast of characters, the variety of tracks, and the shopping feature. However, they criticized the lack of multiplayer and the relative shallowness of the racing gameplay (in particular that cars cannot get into crashes), and concluded it to be \\"a good, not a great, ride.\\" Crash 'n Burn received the Best Driving Game award from GameFans 1993 Megawards. == Legacy == Due chiefly to the unexpectedly slow growth of the next generation gaming market, Crystal Dynamics's massive expansion in its early years failed to pay off. In 1996 new CEO Ted Ardel announced the company was cutting one third of its workforce and stepping aside as a publisher to focus strictly on games development. For several months the company functioned without a president, with Ardel managing the day-to-day operations until Rob Dyer was promoted to president on April 4, 1997. After Crash 'n Burn, Crystal Dynamics would later become known for developing the Legacy of Kain and Gex series of video games, as well as later entries in the Tomb Raider franchise, starting with the 2006 title Tomb Raider: Legend. == References == == External links == * Crash 'n Burn at GameFAQs * Crash 'n Burn at Giant Bomb * Crash 'n Burn at MobyGames Category:1993 video games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer-only games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Crystal Dynamics games Category:Futuristic racing games Category:Launch titles Category:Pack-in video games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Racing video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Burke Trieschmann Category:Video games set in the 2040s Category:Video games set in the future ","title":"Crash 'n Burn (1993 video game)"},{"id":"3260100","text":"This is a list of notable Jewish American mathematicians.

See also Campbell (1997). is a deity figuring prominently in the religion and mythology of the pre-Columbian Aztec civilization of Mesoamerica. In Aztec mythology, she is seen as an aspect of the mother goddess Coatlicue and is thus labeled ‚Äúmother of the gods‚Äù ().Lit. \\"gods, their mother\\". Campbell, op. cit. She is also called Tlalli Iyollo (, , ‚Äúheart of the earth‚Äù). ==Characteristics and associations== Although considered to be an aged deity, Toci is not always shown with specific markers of great age. Toci is frequently depicted with black markings around the mouth and nose, wearing a headdress with cotton spools (Miller and Taube 1993, p. 170). These are also characteristic motifs for Tlazolteotl, a central Mesoamerican goddess of both purification and filth (tlazolli in Nahuatl) and the two deities are closely identified with one another. Toci was also associated with healing and venerated by curers of ailments and midwives. In the 16th century Florentine Codex compiled by Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, Toci is identified with temazcalli or sweatbaths in which aspect she is sometimes termed Temazcalteci or \\"Grandmother of sweatbaths\\". Tlazolteotl also has an association with temazcalli as the \\"eater of filth\\" and such bathhouses are likely to have been dedicated to either Tlazolteotl or Toci/Temazcalteci.Sections of the Codex Magliabechiano indicate that the god Tezcatlipoca served as tutelary god for temazcalli, however its illustrations also clearly show the face of Tlazolteotl above the doorway; see discussion in Miller and Taube (1993, p.159). Toci also had an identification with war and had also the epithet \\"Woman of Discord\\". ==Traditions in mythology== By one Mexica-Aztec legendary tradition, at some point during their long peregrinations after leaving the mythical homeland Aztlan, the Mexica served as mercenaries to the Culhua at their capital of Culhuacan. The Culhua ruler bestowed his daughter upon the Mexica for an intended marriage with one of the Mexica nobility; however the Mexica's guiding and chief deity Huitzilopochtli intervened and ordered that she be flayed and sacrificed, instead. When this was done she transformed into Toci. The Mexica were expelled from Culhuacan by the Culhua ruler for the act, and the Mexica were pressed on towards Lake Texcoco. It was here that shortly thereafter they founded their capital Tenochtitlan, from which base they would later grow in power to form the Aztec Empire and exert their dominion over the Valley of Mexico (Miller and Taube 1993). ==Festivals and rites== During the veintena of Ochpaniztli in the Aztec calendar, harvest-time festival rites were held to honor Toci in her aspect as \\"Heart of the Earth\\" (Miller and Taube 1993). ==See also== *List of Aztec gods and supernatural beings ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Aztec goddesses Category:Earth goddesses Category:Health goddesses Category:Mother goddesses ","title":"Toci"},{"id":"3260111","text":"Cedar River National Grassland is a National Grassland located in Sioux County and Grant County in southern North Dakota, United States.

Nesiritide works to facilitate cardiovascular fluid homeostasis through counterregulation of the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system, stimulating cyclic guanosine monophosphate, leading to smooth muscle cell relaxation. Nesiritide was believed initially to be beneficial for acute decompensated congestive heart failure. It received approval from the United States' Food and Drug Administration for this purpose in 2001 after initial non-approval. In July 2011 the results of the largest study so far for nesiritide was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study failed to show a difference between nesiritide and placebo on mortality or re- hospitalizations. ==Administration== Nesiritide is only administered intravenously, usually by bolus, followed by IV infusion. For most adults and the elderly, a normal dosage is 2 mg/kg followed by a continuous IV infusion of 0.01 mg/kg/min. This may be increased every three hours for a maximum of 0.03 mg/kg/min. ==Controversy== In 2005, after several academic papers published by Jonathan Sackner-Bernstein on the efficacy and side effects of Nesiritide, Johnson & Johnson met with the FDA and altered its stated plans for the drug and agreed to revise its labeling. Heart doctors at the Cleveland Clinic then voted unanimously not to permit the prescription of the drug to its patients. Johnson and Johnson convened a panel of experts whose advice included the recommendation to conduct the large scale clinical trial that was subsequently published in 2011. Following this, the United States Department of Justice announced an inquiry into the marketing of the drug that led to a fine against the Scios unit of J&J.; ==Side effects== Common side effects include: *Low blood pressure (11% of patients) *Headache *Nausea *Slow heart rate *Kidney failure More rare side effects include: *Confusion *Paresthesia *Somnolence *Tremor == References == == Further reading == * == External links == *Natrecor.com Category:Peptides Category:Drugs acting on the cardiovascular system Category:Johnson & Johnson brands ","title":"Nesiritide"},{"id":"3260137","text":"\\"The One Where No One's Ready\\" is the second episode of the third season of the American television sitcom Friends and 50th overall, which aired on NBC on September 26, 1996. The plot centers on Ross's (David Schwimmer) anxiety as his friends take too long getting ready for a function that evening. The episode was written by Ira Ungerleider and directed by Gail Mancuso. It is a bottle episode, featuring only three speaking roles besides the central cast; occurs in real time; and takes place almost entirely in the living room of Monica and Rachel's apartment. ==Plot== Chandler (Matthew Perry) tricks Joey (Matt LeBlanc) into drinking chicken fat from a glass in Monica's (Courteney Cox) fridge. Ross (David Schwimmer) arrives to gather everyone together for an important function at his museum. Despite only 22 minutes remaining for them to don their formal attire, no one else is ready, apart from Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) who arrives fully dressed and ready to go. When Monica returns, she checks her answering-machine messages and hears a message from her ex- boyfriend Richard (Tom Selleck). She is unable to determine whether the message was left before or after they broke up. After Chandler comes back from the bathroom, he is dismayed to find that Joey took his chair while he was up. They argue over the chair until Joey accidentally flings hummus onto Phoebe's dress. She tries to ask Monica what gets out hummus, but Monica is too distracted with her own problems. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) then tries to find something else for Phoebe to wear, but is unsuccessful. In a fit of insecurity, Monica breaks into Richard's voicemail, and hears a message left by another woman, leading her to believe that Richard has already begun seeing someone else. Chandler suggests the woman might be Richard's daughter Michelle, and Monica confirms this by prank-calling her. Michelle calls her back, and Monica admits her indiscretions. She is unable to secure Michelle's silence on the matter, so Chandler and Phoebe are left yanking her off the second phone in her bedroom. Ross orders Chandler to get dressed. When he does, Joey surrenders the chair but takes its cushions with him. Phoebe eventually finds a Christmas ribbon meant to garnish a present in Rachel's room and wears that on her dress to cover the stain. Rachel is the only one almost ready to go, but she cannot decide on what to wear, trying Ross's patience. Eventually he snaps and yells at her in front of everyone, demanding that she pick out any outfit at all so that they can go. In response, Rachel emerges in sweat pants, having lost interest in attending the function. Unbeknownst to Joey, Chandler has already taken his revenge by hiding all of Joey's underwear, forcing him to go commando in a rented tux. Joey promises to do the \\"opposite\\" of Chandler hiding his underwear, and emerges wearing everything Chandler owns (and still sans underwear). Ross finally steps in and bans them from the function, and apologetically asks Rachel what he can do to make it up to her, to which Joey suggests that he drink the glass of chicken fat. Ross agrees, but Rachel stops him just in time. Overwhelmed by the depths of his love for her, she dresses in record time while Ross sorts out Joey and Chandler's argument, and Monica makes her final disastrous access to Richard's answering machine. She breaks into his voicemail again to erase all his messages and record a new one. However, she accidentally deletes and re- records his outgoing message, humiliating herself. Finally, Rachel and Ross are the only ones in the apartment, with five seconds to spare. They kiss, but Rachel hurries them out the door to make sure they are not late‚Äîbut not before telling him she is going commando too. Over the credits, Professor Sherman Whitfield (Peter Dennis) joins Ross' table to congratulate him. When Chandler returns, he declares that Whitfield is in his seat, culminating in his demanding the professor's underwear. ==Production== The bottle episode format of the series was conceived by executive producer Kevin S. Bright as a way of saving money for other episodes by using a single set and no guest stars. The success of this episode led to the format being used at least once per season thereafter, with episodes including \\"The One with Monica's Thunder\\" and \\"The One on the Last Night\\" being based solely around the six core cast. Bright believes these episodes were some of the best of the series. This is also the only episode of Friends to take place in \\"real time\\". Matt LeBlanc dislocated his shoulder during one take of the stunt where Joey and Chandler race towards the chair, landing upside down as a result, with the audience assuming it was part of the act. The injury was not edited into the episode, but for the following two episodes, LeBlanc's injury was written into the show as Joey dislocating his shoulder while jumping on his bed.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-08-09/friends-star-matt-leblanc- reveals-the-silly-stunt-that-put-joeys-arm-in-a-sling/ ==Reception== Entertainment Weekly notes that the episode \\"owes a large stylistic debt to Seinfeld\\", specifically citing the 1991 episode \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", which also plays out in real time. It rates the episode C and calls the answering machine gag \\"derivative of George Costanza\\". The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends call it \\"forgettable\\"; \\"The script is dull and the performers seem to know it, with none of them trying particularly hard to make it work\\". Allmovie says it \\"stands out for the way it realistically portrays how group inertia can slow you down\\". Popular reaction is more positive; the episode appeared on one of the first region 1 \\"best of\\" DVD releases and it was voted the third most popular episode in an NBC poll in 2004. Joey's use of the phrase \\"going commando,\\" which originated in the U.S. on college campuses in the early 1970s, became a popular catchphrase, especially with sports-related media. (copy from The Detroit News) ==Parody== Part of this episode was recreated, line for line, in the video for Moonlight, a song from 4:44 by Jay-Z, featuring an all-black cast. The recreation is detailed - the setting, the shots and the costumes are the same - but the theme song is Friends by Whodini instead of I'll Be There for You by The Rembrandts. Jerrod Carmichael is Ross, Issa Rae is Rachel, Tiffany Haddish is Phoebe, Lakeith Stanfield is Chandler, Lil Rel Howery is Joey, and Tessa Thompson is Monica. ==ReferencesCategory:1996 American television episodes Category:Friends (season 3) episodes Category:Bottle television episodes ","title":"The One Where No One's Ready"},{"id":"3260142","text":"Jabuk (formerly Marmon Jabuk) is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and respectively about west and east of the municipal seats of Pinnaroo and Tailem Bend. It began originally by 1908 as a private subdivision of section 5 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Peake by a local landowner known as \\"Mr.Cross of Wellington\\". In several sources, it has been described as a private town. The name was officially altered from Marmon Jabuk to Jabuk on 20 February 1941. Boundaries for the locality were created on 12 August 1999 for the portion within the Southern Mallee District Council and on 24 August 2000 for the portion within the Coorong District Council. The name appears to be derived from the nearby Marmon Jabuk Range, but the origin of that name is unclear. It could be named from an Afghan word by a cameleer, or from a local Aboriginal word. The 'private town' is located in the approximate centre of the locality with the Mallee Highway to its north and the Pinnaroo railway line to its south. There is also a war memorial, institute, football oval, tennis courts with lights and a play ground. Jabuk has a tennis club with a senior section. The football oval is no longer in use, and now farmed, and its clubrooms are used by the Jabuk tennis team. The Epiphany Lutheran Church, the foundation stone being laid on 7 February 1960, has long been closed. There is also a Baptist church which is no longer in use. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Jabuk had a population of 66.

Quarterman (born April 27, 1954) is an American author and long time Internet participant. He wrote one of the classic books about networking prior to the commercialization of the Internet. He has also written about risk management. ==Biography== Quarterman grew up in the Bemiss community, near Valdosta, Georgia, USA. He first used the ARPANET in 1974 while attending Harvard, and worked on UNIX ARPANET software at BBN (the original prime contractor on the ARPANET) from 1977 to 1981. He was twice elected to the Board of Directors of the USENIX Association, a professional association related to the UNIX operating system. While on that board, he was instrumental in its vote in 1987 to approve the first funding received by UUNET, which, along with PSINet, became one of the first two commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs). He co-founded the first Internet consulting firm in Texas (TIC) in 1986, and co-founded one of the first ISPs in Austin (Zilker Internet Park, since sold to Jump Point). He was a founder of TISPA, the Texas ISP Association. He was a founder and Chief Technology Officer of Matrix NetSystems Inc., established as Matrix Information and Directory Services (MIDS) in 1990. Quarterman published the first maps of the whole Internet; conducted the first Internet Demographic Survey and started the first continuing series of performance data about the entire Internet in 1993, on the web since 1995 in the Internet Weather Report, and also visible as Internet Average, plus comparisons of ISPs visible as ISP Ratings. Inter@ctive Week listed John Quarterman as one of the 25 Unsung Heroes of the Internet in 1998, saying ...\\"As president of [MIDS], Quarterman, 43, is to Net demographics what The Gallup Organization is to opinion polls.\\"\\"25 Unsung Heroes Of The Net\\".

Television and DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and released in 1979 by Warner Bros. as part of the Christmas special, Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales. The cartoon is an adaptation of the Charles Dickens 1843 classic A Christmas Carol, featuring Yosemite Sam as Ebenezer Scrooge and Porky Pig as Bob Cratchit. Bugs Bunny plays Jacob Marley and Fred. Scrooge's dream-journey into his past, present, and future is omitted; instead, Bugs dresses up as a white-robed emissary of Hades to scare Scrooge straight. ==Plot== Scrooge (played by Yosemite Sam) is counting money in the counting house of his firm when Bob Cratchit (Porky) comes in, wanting to borrow a lump of coal as he is freezing. Scrooge refuses (\\"I gave you one last Tuesday,\\" he says; \\"You should've made it last.\\") and tells him to just work faster so he'll keep warm. Then Scrooge's nephew Fred (Bugs) comes in with Christmas decorations and mistletoe. He is tossed out, and decides that \\"somebody oughta teach that little humbug some Christmas spirit\\". Fred then borrows a piece of coal and places it in the office of Cratchit, who graciously thanks him. However, Scrooge's cat Sylvester notices this and warns him. Scrooge takes back the coal and fires Cratchit...throwing him out along with carolers (Elmer Fudd, Pep√© Le Pew and Foghorn Leghorn) whom Fred let into the office. Cratchit invites Fred to dinner and introduces him to his youngest son Tiny Tim (Tweety Bird). \\"Kinda puny, isn't he?\\" Bugs notes. \\"If you had to live on birdseed, you'd be puny too!\\" Tim retorts. Scrooge sends the light company to take the last candle (as Cratchit is past due) and a notice that the house is being foreclosed, forcing Cratchit to move out by midnight. Fred decides this is the last straw, remarking Bugs's catchphrase \\"Of course, you realize that this means war.\\" First, Fred annoys Scrooge with more carolers. When Scrooge goes out to deal with this, he slips into a pile of snow. Next, he puts snow into Scrooge's hot bath, turning it ice-cold as Scrooge jumps in. Fred then dresses up as a ghost - specifically, Scrooge's late business partner Jacob Marley. As Marley, he drags around chains and beats a drum. Investigating, Scrooge accidentally slips down the stairs and into the cold along with Sylvester. When they return to bed, Marley reappears. Sylvester promptly flees, slamming the door behind him and cutting off Scrooge. Marley threatens to take Scrooge to see \\"the man in the red suit\\" (the Devil, though Scrooge first guesses Santa Claus). Scrooge promptly changes his ways for the better. To prove himself reformed, he dresses up as Santa Claus and runs through the streets at night - giving money to the poor, widows, orphans, and the like. He also rehires Bob Cratchit by making his new partner in the firm, succeeding Marley. Tweety raises a toast to him, and Fred kisses him. Scrooge (now going by the name of Sam) still hates kissing, though. This story is the first part of Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales. As the second one featuring Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner (Freeze Frame) begins, Bugs congratulates Sam for making Scrooge a charitable character, but Sam tells Bugs that it was all a play, and asks Porky and the gang to give all his money back to him. ==References== == See also == * List of A Christmas Carol adaptations * List of Yosemite Sam cartoons * List of Bugs Bunny cartoons * List of Porky Pig cartoons * List of cartoons featuring Sylvester ==External links== * Category:1979 television films Category:American Christmas films Category:Animated Christmas films Category:Animated comedy films Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:Ghosts in television Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:American films Category:American television films Category:1970s American animated films Category:Animated films based on novels ","title":"Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol"},{"id":"3260202","text":"This is a list of notable Jewish American cartoonists.

The theme of the song is about a young woman whose boyfriend continuously cheats on her and leaves her waiting for him on important dates. The song is a female empowerment anthem and reveals how the young woman refuses to go through the pain that her boyfriend has caused in their relationship. She eventually tells the guy it is over and that she will never get back with him. (\\"I don't want you/ I don't love you/ I hit the road jack/ 'cause I'm through with you/ Did ya understand that?\\"). The song failed to meet any success, with Ford claiming that the lack of interest was due to the September 11 attacks on the date of the release. ==Music video== The video was directed by Chris Applebaum and edited by Nabil Mechi. Adam Stern produced the video. Willa Ford wrote the treatment for the video. The video version of the song added a punked out, metal-esque (produced by Lamar Young, Dre Lewis, and engineer Danny Blaszczak) segment which featured Ford in dreads and a Playboy guitar which she eventually smashes. The video also contained a twist at the end when it showed a bed scene with Willa Ford's character and another female together, as her boyfriend returned home in the morning. Coincidentally enough, the other female is the same character that her boyfriend was having an affair with at a club. The video was nominated for Best Hair, which was done by Adir Abergai, in the 2002 MVPA Awards.

First settled in 1734, it holds two of the oldest standing houses in Loudoun County, \\"Hunting Hill\\" and \\"Foxton Cottage\\", directly across the Catoctin Creek from each other. The Taylorstown Historic District, comprising the core of the village, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 30, 1978 and expanded in 2005. ==History== The first resident of the Taylorstown area was Richard Brown, a devout Quaker who arrived in the 1730s from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to establish a mill. Finding Catoctin Creek to be the ideal location, he acquired a large parcel of several hundred acres of farm and woodland which ranged from the Potomac south to Lincoln. In 1734, Brown constructed a small house that would later bear the name of Hunting Hill, and which remains the oldest standing building in Loudoun County. Richard Brown died in May 1745, and left his land divided into tracts for his wife and each of his five sons. His wife inherited the tract that contained the Taylorstown area and its buildings, and she later passed her tract to her youngest son, Mercer Brown, who sold it in 1784. The purchaser was Thomas Taylor, a wealthy Quaker from Frederick County, Maryland, who also had a strong interest in a milling operation. While living at Hunting Hill, Taylor erected a new mill of local stone about north of the site of the original mill. Known today as the Taylorstown Mill, the structure was built largely by slaves from local farms, who were hired when their masters could spare them and paid wages according to the Quaker customs of the day. Today, there are many initials and names carved into the stones of the Mill--perhaps some of them were from the builders or their employers. Following the mill's completion, Taylor sold off quarter-acre lots of the land surrounding the mill. The new settlers called the area Taylor Town, which became Taylorstown around 1900. The Taylorstown Mill was continuously in operation until 1911, when its water wheel was sold to the nearby Oatlands Mill and the mill converted to steam power. In 1932, the steam engines were removed and the Mill became a feed store until Anna Hedrick bought it in the late 1950s. Since the late 1960s, Taylorstown Mill has been a private residence. The private residence today called Whiskey Hill dates to the late 18th century. ===Establishment as a community=== Taylorstown was transformed from a small settlement into a thriving agricultural community over about a hundred years. The greatest catalyst for growth was farming and milling (there were at least three mills in the area) and to some extent iron mining from the local Furnace Mountain, which attracted miners during the late 18th and early 19th century. Traces of the old mining operation remain today. The furnace used to separate iron from the ore was near the Potomac River; a tunnel brought water from the Catoctin Creek to power its bellows. During the 19th century, the Taylorstown area was one of the most densely populated areas of Loudoun County. The town had a post office, a blacksmith's shop, 2 mills (one is still standing), a U.S. Government-operated still, general and supply stores and a movie theatre. There are also records of schools, most notably the Crossroads School built in 1834, which was located near Waterford Downs until the 1940s. ===Trouble during the Civil War=== Many of the original residents of Taylorstown were Quakers and sympathetic to the North. Some aided Northern forces by smuggling food and supplies across the Potomac River. In retaliation, a group of Confederate soldiers attacked the locals and burned down the mill and the only bridge across Catoctin Creek. ==Proposed dam and the Catoctin Valley Defense Alliance== The Catoctin Valley Defense Alliance was formed in 1974 by the citizens of Taylorstown. The group became very active in response to the possibility of Catoctin Creek being dammed. The Fairfax Water Authority, the Washington, D.C. Government, and the Washington Commission proposed plans for a drought relief water supply. This plan deemed the of the lower Catoctin Valley \\"the most effective, reliable and cost effective\\" of a multitude of water supply alternatives considered by the engineers. A dam would be built near where Catoctin Creek empties into the Potomac, which would create a five mile (8 km)-long, . deep \\"feeder lake\\" that could hold of water. All of the collected water could be released in a time of drought, which would swell the Potomac and provide emergency water as the water flowed down the river to Washington, D.C. If constructed, it would place the Taylorstown Historic District in danger of destruction. The local community rallied behind the Catoctin Valley Defense Alliance to help stop such a \\"feeder lake\\". During this time, local vehicles displayed bright red bumper stickers which proclaimed \\"Don't Dam Taylorstown,\\" which was changed to \\"Don‚Äôt Dam Loudoun\\" when it became clear that more land was going to be endangered beyond Taylorstown and its surrounding environs. Phil Erenkranz and Miss Anna Hedrick, two lawyers actively involved in the Defense Alliance, went before the Virginia General Assembly in Richmond. It became Virginia state law that one county did not have the right of \\"eminent domain\\" over another. No longer could Fairfax County and Washington, D.C. legally take water or anything else from Loudoun County without permission. Defeated legally, the engineers were no longer interested in building their dam. (However, a group of beavers built a large dam on the exact site proposed for damming not more than a week later.) Compelled to protect the community from future threats, citizens sought out preservation legislation: Catoctin Creek was designated a State Scenic River, and the town center of Taylorstown was registered as a historical location under the Historical Preservation Act. ==Contemporary Taylorstown== Taylorstown is today a community of about four thousand people (3,216 were recorded in the 2000 census, a number that has grown significantly) who live generally within a three-mile (5 km) radius of the original town center. It is no longer considered an official township of Virginia, and has consequently been vaguely divided among the distantly neighboring towns of Leesburg, Lovettsville, Lucketts, and Waterford. This has resulted in a confusion of government services: some residents have the address of one town, the phone number of another, and the school of whichever district maintains the nearest bus route. The population is economically diverse. Some residents are artists and do not possess working plumbing, other residents live in mansions worth tens of millions, and the rest are somewhere in between. Easy access to the MARC commuter rail has also brought in a number of residents who commute to work daily in Washington, D.C. via an hour-long train ride. ==National Register of Historic Places== The Taylorstown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 30, 1978. The district was expanded on May 26, 2005. ==References== ==External links== *Taylorstown Community Association Blog *Taylorstown Store Official Site *Taylorstown Store Wikipedia page *The EcoVillage of Taylorstown *Washington Post article about traffic in Taylorstown *Washington Post article about effort to re-open the Taylorstown Store Category:Unincorporated communities in Loudoun County, Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Virginia Category:Washington metropolitan area ","title":"Taylorstown, Virginia"},{"id":"3260231","text":"Curlew National Grassland is a National Grassland located in Oneida and Power counties in the state of Idaho, USA.

Constructed in 1998 by the Halter Marine Group in Gulfport, Mississippi, the Kennicott has been one of the most vital vessels to the Alaska ferry system since its inception. It is nine-deck, ocean certified vessel and is also able to serve as a command and logistics vessel in the event of disaster or oil spill. The ferry system, taking advantage of her ocean-going status, sends the vessel on a monthly trans-Gulf of Alaska (\\"cross-gulf\\") voyage beginning in Juneau and concluding in Kodiak. On this voyage, the Kennicott is able to provide service to the isolated Gulf of Alaska community of Yakutat and is the only vessel to do so. The cross-gulf voyages are very popular and quite often sold out. The Kennicott and the Tustumena are the Alaska Marine Highway's only accredited ocean-going vessels. The Kennicott also serves as a mainline relief ferry in the event other ferries are out of service. The Kennicotts amenities include a hot-food cafeteria; cocktail lounge and bar; solarium; forward, aft, movie, and business lounges; gift shop; 51 four-berth cabins; and 58 two-berth cabins. The aft portion of the Kennicott appears bloated because there is an external car elevator built into the superstructure. The elevator is used in ports without roll-on ramps allowing service to ordinary docks. Tustumena is the only other ferry with this feature.

It later became a unit of local government administration. Liberties were areas of widely variable extent which were independent of the usual system of hundreds and boroughs for a number of different reasons, usually to do with peculiarities of tenure. Because of their tenurial rather than geographical origin, the areas covered by liberties could either be widely scattered across a county or limited to an area smaller than a single parish: an example of the former is Fordington Liberty, and of the latter, the Liberty of Waybayouse, both in Dorset. In northern England, the liberty of Bowland was one of the larger tenurial configurations covering some ten manors, eight townships and four parishes under the sway of a single feudal lord, the Lord of Bowland, whose customary title is Lord of the Fells. Up until 1660, such lords would have been lords paramount. Legislation passed in 1836 ended the temporal jurisdiction of the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Ely in several liberties, and the Liberties Act 1850 permitted the merging of liberties in their counties. By 1867, only a handful remained: Ely, Havering-atte-Bower, St Albans, Peterborough, Ripon and Haverfordwest. St Albans was subsequently joined to the county of Hertfordshire in 1875. The Local Government Act 1888 led to the ending of the special jurisdictions in April 1889: the Isle of Ely and Soke of Peterborough became administrative counties, while the three remaining liberties were united to their surrounding counties. ==Inner and Middle Temples== Inner Temple and Middle Temple, which occupy an area in London known as The Temple, describe themselves as liberties based on letters patent from 1608 and retain a large degree of independence to the present day. They are extra-parochial areas, historically not governed by the City of London Corporation, and are today regarded as local authorities for most purposes. They are also outside the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. They geographically fall within the boundaries of the City of London, but can be thought of as independent enclaves. The local government functions of the Inner and Middle Temples are allocated by the Temples Order 1971S.I. 1971 No.1732 which provides that the Sub-Treasurer of the Inner Temple and the Under-Treasurer of the Middle Temple may exercise any function of an Inner London borough defined in either of ss.1(4) or 6 London Government Act 1963 which is not expressly excepted by an Act or Order. Exceptions in the 1971 Order include various matters associated with housing, planning, public welfare and health; the effect is usually to direct such excepted powers or responsibilities to the Common Council of the City of London.
