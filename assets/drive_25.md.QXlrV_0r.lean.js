(Adam, Limbuela and Tesema) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department was a case decided on 3 November 2005 by the UK House of Lords that determined whether or not a delay in initiating an application to seek asylum limited an individual from receiving access to state relief.R. (Adam, Limbuela and Tesema) v. Secretary of State for Home Department [2005 UKHL 66] Furthermore, the case questioned whether this denial of state relief constituted a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 ('ECHR'). The Home Office refused the claimants state support under Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration, and Asylum Act 2002, under the basis that the asylum seekers did not make their claim as soon as reasonably practical. Article 3 of the ECHR prohibits torture, inhuman or degrading treatment and/or punishment of individuals.European Convention on Human Rights 1950 In this case, the court observed that due to this refusal of state support, Yusif Adam, Wayoka Limbuela and Binyam Tefera Tesema were exposed to the risk of being homeless, were without access to food and were prevented from working while waiting for their application to be processed. These circumstances were thus considered to be an Article 3 violation, and led the House of Lords to dismiss the Appeal with costs and grant state relief to the claimants under Section 55(5) of the Act. Following this judgment, asylum seekers who apply late may receive accommodation and financial support if the alternative is a real risk of destitution and a violation of human rights. == Background == Following Royal Assent on 7 November 2002 the then Minister for Citizenship and Immigration, Beverley Hughes, ushered in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. This Act required all adult asylum seekers make an application for asylum support. Section 55 (1) of the Act prevents the Home Office and other public authorities in the UK from providing support and accommodation to asylum seekers unless satisfied that the applicant's claim for asylum was made as soon as reasonably practicable after their arrival in the UK. A three-day time frame is used as a general guideline to satisfy this \\"as soon as reasonably practicable\\" test, but dependent on the particular circumstances of each individual it may be decided that the applicant could not have claimed within that period, or that the applicant should have claimed earlier. Yusif Adam arrived in the UK from Sudan, Wayoka Limbuela arrived in the UK from Angola, and Binyam Tefera Tesema arrived in the UK from Ethiopia. Each of the claimants claimed asylum the following day upon arriving in the UK. All three asylum claimants were refused state report due to the operation of Section 55 of the Act, and this limited their access to adequate shelter, food and other necessary requirements until they were later granted interim relief following the judicial review of their applications. Adam had been sleeping rough in a shelterless car park from 16 October 2003 to 10cNovember 2003, almost one month. He had access to the Refugee Council's premises during the day but due to the lack of proper shelter his mental and physical health deteriorated. When Limbuela's application for judicial review was heard he had already been forced to sleep rough for two days and beg for food due to the lack of state support. Other evidence of destitution presented to the hearing judge included a series of medical complaints from which Limbuela was suffering that were exacerbated by Secretary of State's refusal. Similarly, Tesema was about to be evicted from his emergency accommodation and if he had been, he would have had no access to housing, no money for food, and no private sanitary facilities. Adam, Limbuela, and Tesema were each successful in their application for judicial review in the Administrative Court, which was later upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Home Office then appealed to the House of Lords. The Appellant, the Home Office, refused the claimants state support under Section 55 of the Act which allowed the Home Office to refuse support to asylum seekers who did not make their claim for asylum as soon as reasonably practicable. The Court of Appeal, and subsequently the House of Lords, observed this legislation with reference to Section 55(5) that allows an exception that provides that support should still be provided to asylum- seekers if a failure to do so would violate their human rights. Hence, Adam, Limbuela, and Tesema responded by arguing that their circumstances satisfied the provision in Section 55(5)(a) which entitled them to receive state support from the Home Office due to violation of their rights under the ECHR (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998). The charity Shelter, and the National Council for Civil Liberties and Justice provided written submissions in support of the appellants as Interveners. The Appellant was represented by Nigel Griffin QC, John-Paul Waite and Kate Grange (instructed by Treasury Solicitor). The Respondents were represented by Nicholas Blake QC, with White Ryland as instructing solicitors for Limbuela and Tesema and H C L Hanne & Co as instructing solicitors for Adam. == Decision == Firstly, the House of Lords had to determine in what circumstances did the Secretary of State become obliged to provide state support and relief to an asylum seeker who did not make their application as soon as reasonably practicable after arriving in the UK under Section 55 of the Act. Secondly, the House of Lords needed to determine in what circumstances would the refusal of state support and relief by the Secretary of State constitute a breach of Article 3 of ECHR rights. === Standard of Proof required to trigger Section 55(5)(a) === The legislation prohibits the Home Office from providing state support to asylum applicants if they had not done so as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Section 55(5)(a) provides an exception where support can be given if it is necessary in order to prevent a breach of rights under the ECHR. The House of Lords decided that within Article 3 there was no general public duty to provide support to the destitute, however there will be circumstances where the threshold may be crossed when a late applicant has no means and no alternative source of support. Lord Bingham identified that the Home Office's statutory duty was triggered: > \\"when it appears on a fair and objective assessment of all relevant facts > and circumstances that an individual applicant faces an imminent prospect of > serious suffering caused or materially aggravated by denial of shelter, food > or the most basic necessities of life\\". Furthermore, the House of Lords confirmed that: > \\"Many factors may affect that judgment, including age, gender, mental and > physical health and condition, any facilities or sources of support > available to the applicant, the weather and time of year and the period for > which the applicant has already suffered or is likely to continue to suffer > privation.\\" It was determined that although the State had not inflicted violence or punishment on the Respondents, they were still held responsible for leaving them in a position of destitution for it was the statutory regime itself that removed any form of support to access food, shelter and employment opportunities that would assist them in supporting themselves. Lord Scott further acknowledged that the Home Office's mere failure to provide a minimum level of social support could not engage Article 3, but saw it as different if the statutory regime imposed restrictions on an individual's access to basic social security and other state benefits, which he or she would be entitled to if not for the legislation. === Article 3 of the ECHR Threshold === Article 3 of the ECHR states that: > \\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment > or punishment.\\" The House of Lords applied the precedent in Pretty v. United Kingdom [2002] 35 EHRR 1 in order to determine if the refusal of support violated Article 3 of the ECHR.Pretty v. United Kingdom, Application no. 2346/02, Council of Europe: European Court of Human Rights, 29 April 2002, available at: https://www.refworld.org/cases,ECHR,4daee1682.html [accessed 5 June 2019] Lord Hope and Lord Bingham both referenced paragraph [52] of the judgment where the European Court observed what types of \\"treatment\\" would fall within the scope of Article 3. The Court referred to \\"ill-treatment\\" that attains \\"a minimum level of severity and involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering\\",Ireland v. The United Kingdom, 5310/71, Council of Europe: European Court of Human Rights, 13 December 1977, available at: https://www.refworld.org/cases,ECHR,3ae6b7004.html [accessed 5 June 2019] \\"where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for, or diminishing, his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual's moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3\\". Therefore, on this basis it was determined that the circumstances suffered by Adam, Limbuela and Tesema had reached this necessary degree of severity to be considered \\"inhuman or degrading treatment\\". The Home Office therefore should have provided state relief by power under section 55(5)(a), and the duty under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998. === Boundary between Positive and Negative Obligations === The distinction between positive and negative duties is mirrored in the traditional division between civil and political rights which are designed to \\"restrain the State from intruding\\", and socio-economic rights which \\"elicit protection by the State\\". Lady Hale described the boundary between a positive and negative obligation as not \\"clear cut\\", and Lord Brown stated that ‚ÄòTime and again these are shown to be false dichotomies.‚Äô Ultimately, Lord Brown and Lord Hope agreed that it was more important to view the issue in terms of whether \\"the state is to be properly regarded as responsible for the harm inflicted (or threatened) upon the victim\\" thus the question of whether there was a positive obligation, rather than mere inaction, was not further explored in this decision. == Significance == The result of this case was particularly relevant due to the political climate at the time, where issues surrounding the integrity of the UK's borders and the asylum process were under serious debate. It marked the development of the UK's growing global commitment to protecting universal human rights through its legislative frameworks. However, whilst this case's decision was a progressive interpretation of Article 3, the threshold remains high and courts will continue to be bound by this provision in some circumstances. === Universal Human Rights === This case highlighted the importance of the universality of human rights obligations. Rather than focusing on 'citizens' rights, the outcome of this case heralded a major legislative change that moved the UK Government away from discriminatory social policies and provisions, and more towards protecting human rights. The ECHR was drafted to represent an egalitarian vision of human rights, where all rights are guaranteed by virtue of existence. However, the discriminatory application of Section 55 in this case was one example of how the UK government experienced the struggle between ensuring equality and non- discrimination in its treatment of asylum seekers, whilst also protecting citizen's rights and democracy when allocating resources for the people within its jurisdiction. Hence, authors suggest that the majority decision in the House of the Lords avoided giving any hints on their own views on the UK Government's policy but left room for substantive review Academic Sandra Fredman noted that attempts to draw a clear distinction between negative and positive obligations has been strained by the need to balance civil and political rights on one hand, and socio-economic rights on the other when it comes to human rights cases. Fredman further states that nowhere is the difficulty in achieving this balance more apparent than in cases brought before the courts by asylum seekers who have had their state relief withdrawn and are as a result living in dire circumstances. === Response === A 2006 Refugee Action Report stated that preceding the judgment of this case, approximately 14,760 asylum seekers applied to the Home Office for support and were then referred for a decision under Section 55. Out of the applications who were considered to have applied on time, not including those with dependents, 9,410 were refused on the basis that they did not meet the threshold under Section 55 of the Act. The following year it was reported that 1,565 applicants were referred for a decision, and only 225 applicants were refused support by the Home Office. Housing charity Shelter, which supported the three claimants in their cases welcomed the decision. Shelter's director, Adam Sampson, said: \\"This judgment is a victory for very vulnerable people who are in desperate need with nowhere to turn. We hope that it will now not only implement the court's guidance, but also undertake a thorough review of Section 55 called for by the home affairs select committee.\\" The Home Office admitted section 55 was \\"a tough measure\\", it said: \\"The essential point of section 55 is that we are not prepared to use taxpayers' money on supporting people who make speculative asylum claims or who have some alternative source of support.\\" Furthermore, they stated that they endeavoured to ensure that economic migrants were not abusing section 55 and would not be supported at the public's expense. ==See also== *Pretty v United Kingdom *Human rights in the United Kingdom ==References== Category:Immigration case law Category:Statelessness Category:2005 in case law Category:House of Lords cases ","title":"R.

The first version of the song was written by Costello in 1974 and featured post-war themed lyrics that were largely scrapped in the final recording. In the final version of the song, Costello included lyrics about seduction and power. Musically, the song was performed at a slower tempo and features a band performance praised by Costello. Pete Thomas notably performed a drum beat inspired by songs from Devo and Stevie Wonder. \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" was released on Trust as an album track and did not get released as a single. Since its release, the song has appeared on numerous compilations and has been praised by critics as a highlight from Trust. The track has also made multiple appearances in Costello's live performances. ==Background== The first version of \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" was written by Costello in 1974. This early draft was entitled \\"From Kansas to Berlin\\" and was \\"a big, grand song about postwar life\\" according to Costello. Costello saved the song's lyrics in notebooks for years before returning to them on his 1981 album Trust. The only surviving lyric from the original draft was \\"When are they going to stop all of these victory processions?\\" According to Costello, \\"the carnal comedy in ['New Lace Sleeves'], all the embarrassment of the morning after\\" was not present in the original draft of the song. As he explained in his autobiography Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink, \\"If the tone of the first draft had been a little pious and even moralistic, I wasn't feeling nearly so high-minded by 1980\\". Costello also cited what he characterized as the British press' love of scandal and said, \\"It also was about class and control. People used to say Margaret Thatcher held her Cabinet with some sort of sexual magnetism. Power is seductive\\". ==Music== \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" was described by Costello as \\"almost like dub reggae\\". Costello also emphasized the importance of the song's slower speed, saying, \\"Some of the best things the Attractions did, like this one, were at slower tempos. It's a myth that it's all about speed and power. ... We had to be exhausted to play like that. We had to drain ourselves of the impulse to play fast\\". Additionally, Costello highlighted how \\"the fact that the music was slinky suited the words\\". Costello described \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" as \\"what I think of as [the Attractions'] most original ensemble performance\\" and \\"one of the greatest Attractions performances\\". The song notably features a drum pattern by Pete Thomas that was inspired by Devo's cover of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" and Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\". Thomas recalled, \\"[Producer] Nick Lowe was standing by the drums while we were trying things out and said, 'What about something like 'Satisfaction‚Äîthat Devo thing. And I probably did something, and Nick said, 'Do the snare there, the hi-hat there...' and then I had to make sense of it. It‚Äôs 'Satisfaction' by Devo into 'Superstition', and it doesn't sound anything like either\\". ==Release and reception== \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" was released on Costello's fifth album, Trust, in 1981. The song was not released as a single. Since its initial release, \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" has appeared on multiple compilation albums, including Girls Girls Girls, The Very Best of Elvis Costello, and The Best of Elvis Costello: The First 10 Years. \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" has received critical acclaim and has been named by some critics as one of the highlights of Trust. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the song as well as \\"Watch Your Step\\" as \\"the album's undisputed twin highlights\\", while the Rolling Stone Album Guide described \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" as a \\"great song\\" where Costello \\"finally comes clean about his woman problems\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the track a \\"highlight\\" of Trust and Blender praised Costello's \\"peerless acid tongue\\" on the song. Jim Beviglia of American Songwriter ranked \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" as the eighth best Elvis Costello song ever, calling the song the \\"towering peak\\" of Trust and \\"a magnificent song on which he was clearly more inspired than impaired\\". ==Live performances== \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" often appears in Costello's live setlist as one of his deeper cuts. Costello performed the song on Tomorrow with Tom Snyder in 1981, along with \\"Watch Your Step\\". A life performance from a 1981 show at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia has been uploaded by Paste Magazine. ==References== Citations Sources * * Category:Elvis Costello songs Category:1981 songs Category:Songs written by Elvis Costello Category:Song recordings produced by Nick Lowe ","title":"New Lace Sleeves"},{"id":"60359147","text":"Berejiklian ministry may refer to: *First Berejiklian ministry, January 2017 to March 2019 *Second Berejiklian ministry, April 2019 to date ","title":"Berejiklian ministry"},{"id":"60359171","text":"John J.

He made an important contribution to the translation of the New Testament into Khoekhoe through his careful revisions of the work of Johann Georg Kr√∂nlein. == Work in South West Africa == Kreft worked as an innkeeper, but after three years of service in the Prussian Army, he enrolled at the Rhenish Missionary Institute in Barmen on January 1, 1848. After graduation, he began his ministry in May 1853 in Bethanie, South West Africa. Though not considered a full missionary yet, his decisive actions against the Nama captain David Christiaan Goliath earned him full ordination in 1856. From 1853 to 1858, Uerieta Kazahendike lived at his house in Bethanie. On July 25, 1858, shortly after moving into the house of the Rev. Carl Hugo Hahn in Gross Barmen, Uerieta was baptized Johanna, the first convert among the Herero. Kreft's hard work was rewarded by the dedication of a new church in Bethanie on June 26, 1859. Unfortunately, Christiaan's alcoholism proved influential among the locals, and the mission was further hampered by constant Herero-Nama wars, heavy drought, and plagues of locusts. These hazards often required the residents of Bethanie to flee with their livestock. Part of the congregation, disillusioned with Christiaan, traveled north to settle in Grootfontein in Maltah√∂he. Kreft left to persuade them to return, but became seriously ill and died there. == Legacy == Kreft was the patriarch of the Kreft family in South Africa.

She began painting at an early age, encouraged by her grandmother. In her teenage years, S√∂rensen continued to pursue visual arts, going on to attend the craft college in Kiel. In 1917 she matriculated at the Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig, where she studied graphic arts, drafting, and advertising. After receiving her diploma in 1924, S√∂rensen married Friedrich Popitz, a physician. In October of 1924, S√∂rensen-Popitz enrolled in the Bauhaus Weimar. In her first semester, S√∂re Popitz attended a first year course covering design foundations taught by Moholy-Nagy, Wassily Kandinsky, and Josef Albers. Her other mentors at the school included Jan Tschichold and Paul Klee. After just a semester at the school, S√∂re Popitz left the Bauhaus, entering the workforce as a designer in Leipzig instead. Her early departure from the Bauhaus is sometimes cited as a reason she emerged as a graphic designer while other female students did not; while the Bauhaus Weimar had begun to accept female designers, women were frequently encouraged to go into weaving and textile design as opposed to the male dominated fields of architecture and graphic arts. From her departure from the Bauhaus until after the war, S√∂re Popitz was frequently employed by Otto Beyer, a publishing house in Leipzig. The majority of S√∂re Popitz's Bauhaus-era work and work produced for Otto Beyer were destroyed in the bombing of Leipzig during World War II. S√∂re Popitz and her husband moved to Frankfurt following the Soviet occupation of East Germany. Friedrich died in 1949, just a few months after the couple's relocation. In mid 1950s, Popitz returned to painting, abandoning the Constructivism that had characterized her pre-war designs for Informalism.

Europe Union regulates the range of the law, including three different interdependent serious legislation, primary and secondary legislation, and law in cases. The empty area regulated by individual national members is not in the coverage of EU law. Based on the EU treaties, EU members each have the right to transfer and implement the discretion of EU law. Therefore, compared to conducting the application to the separate countries in EU it harbors more advantages to apply for the European patent office when seeking to obtain more extensive patent protection. That is to say, at each signatory of the Convention of European Patent, the holder who are granted the patent is given the equivalent right to the national patent of the countries. ==History of European intellectual property== The European patent system offers the home of the world patent system. Venice in 1474 Journal of the Patent and Trademark Office Society (Online). Arlington, Va: Patent and Trademark Office Society, 1985. and the British Monopoly Law in 1623,Statute of Monopolies 1623. Legislation.gov.uk. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ja1/21/3/contents. contributed to the earliest patent system. The development of the European patent system stands for the pioneer and epitome of the evolution of the international patent system; it is the ultimate goal to establish a globalized unified (single) patent system. Besides, EPC, which was signed on 2/10 1973 in Munich, Germany, and entered into force on October 7, 1977, accepted the first patent application on 1/6, 1978.EUROPEAN PATENT CONVENTION 1973. Epo.org. https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/1973/e/ma1.html. Published in 2007. Despite the fact it does not have the membership of the EPC, the EPC system has undergone a large-scale development from the first eight members states to the current 32 members states and five countries, they have recognized the patent rights granted by the EPC. The European Patent Organization established by EPC functions as the European Patent Office and the Administrative Commission. The European Patent Office takes up granting European patents. The Administrative Commission is to oversee the work of the European Patent Office. Headquartered in Munich, Germany, the European Patent Office is conducting the full responsibility for the search, examination and authorization of European patents. Also, with a brand in The Hague and the Netherlands coordinated responsibilities for search. Anyone of the languages, English, German and French, and European patent applications are utilized as the official working languages of the European Patent Office. Member States of EPC (as of August 23, 2007): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, Malta.Countries in the EU and EEA. GOV.UK. https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea. ==Individual rights== ===Patent=== In the United Kingdom, a patent which may be granted for an invention should satisfy several demands: being novel, involved with an inventive procedure, being capable of industrial application and not otherwise excluded from patentability.Patents Act 1977, s1 If the invention is regarded as a product, the patent owner can have the right to prevent third parties from making, disposing of, offering, utilizing importing or remaining that product. If it is deemed as a process, the patent owner can prevent third parties from making use of it or disposing of, offering, using importing or keeping any product made by means of that process.Ibid, s60 Although the patent law was not formally incorporated into the entire community, similar practices were still adopted by other member states and the European Patent Office. According to the European Court of Justice in the Centrafarm v Sterling Drug case,Case 15/74 Centrafarm v Sterling Drug [1974] ECR 1147 a patent contains : The guarantee that the patentee, to reward the creative effort of the inventor, possesses the exclusive right to apply an invention with a view to manufacture and produce industrial products and putting them into circulation for the first time, either directly or by the grant of licenses to third parties, as well as the right to oppose infringements. ===Copyrights=== In the United Kingdom, copyright, as a property includes serious descriptions of work: original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, sound recordings, films, and the typographical arrangement of published editions.Copyright, Design and Patent Act 1988, s1 The owner of copyright possesses the following exclusive rights: to copy the work; to release copies of the work to the public; to rent or lend the work to the public; to perform, present or play the work in public; to perform communication of the work to the public; to make an adaptation of the work or conduct any of the above mentioned in relation to an adaptation.Ibid, s16 Similarly, although the patent law was not formally incorporated into the entire community, similar rules were employed by other member states. Based on the thought of commercial usage in Europe, Musik Vertrieb Membran v GEMA caseCase 55/80 Musik-Vertrieb Membran v GEMA [1981] ECR 147 demonstrated that the commercial property was recognized and acknowledged to be provided the protection afforded by copyright, especially when commercial use is carried out in a manner that allows for the sale of goods containing literary or artistic works in different countries. Besides, in terms of protection, the European Court of Justice rules in Phil Collins v Imtrat Case 326/92 Phil Collins v Imtrat [1993] ECR states that: To guarantee the protection of the rights and economic rights of right holders can be achieved. The protection of moral rights provides an opportunity for both the author and performers particularly to restrain the work from distortions, damage or other modifications, which are detrimental to their honor or reputation. Copyright and proximity are also economically inherent, as they are authorized to commercialize the sale of protected works, especially in the form of licenses for payment of royalties. ===Trademark=== The trademark as a registered right may be authorized by a single member state or a community to achieve the adoption of the 'Domestic Market Integration Office' in AlicanteÔºàa city in SpainÔºâ. No matter which case, A trademark includes any symbol that can be represented graphically, especially words, including a person's name, design, letters, numbers, the shape or packaging of a commodity, as long as these symbols meet the requirement of distinguishing the commodity or service, and undertaking commitments of other enterprisesDir 89/104, Art 2 The trademark owner possesses the right to prohibit third parties from utilizing the same or confusing similar identifiers during the process of their trade without any permission, such as attaching the identification to the goods or their packaging, and importing or exporting the goods bearing the identification or will be put on the market. Everyone can forbid the application of the same logo associated with a registered trade in goods or services, and can also prohibit the utilization of the same or similar logo on the same or similar goods, which unavoidably leads similar confusion to the public. A well-known trademark owner also possesses the right to prohibit any implementation of the logo under these conditions of the absence of proper cause, improper use or damage to distinctive features or visibility of the trademark.Dir 89/104, Art 5 Furthermore, it contains the right of the owner to forbid any application of the mark that may impose an influence on the guarantee of origin. The origin guarantee deemed to be a significant function of the mark aims at ensuring that the origin of the trademarked goods can be clearly known to the consumer or end user, freeing them from any possibility of distinguishing the goods from the products of another place of origin. In addition, it can determine that a trademarked product sold to it has not been subjected to third-party intervention without performing authorization from the trademark owner in the early stages of sale, for example, the effect of the original state of the goods.Case 102/77 Hoffmann-La Roche v Centrafarm [1978] ECR 1139 As with the Right to design, the specific subject matter of trademark rights does not include the right to forbid the transport of goods. The European Court of Justice in the Rioglass caseCase 115/02 Administration des douanes et droits indirects v Rioglass [2003] ECR is legally employed in the production of cars in Spain and transported to Poland and then equipped with a non-member car window and windshield trademark. The court declared that the transport of products would be legally produced in a Member State and then transported to a non-member State, and if one or more Member States did not involve any sale of the products related, therefore it is not necessary for them to bear the responsibility of infringing the specific subject matter of the trademark. ===Appellation of original=== Distinguished from trademark rights, specific names for food and alcohol can also be protected as intellectual property, such as geographical (champagne) or non-geographical names associated with geographic areas. Products originating from the specific region may present specific qualities or characteristics (originating nouns) or probably merely develop and seek for a reputation (origin of origin). In the community, agricultural by-products or food names may be protected by the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Geographical Indications (PGI) in accordance with Regulation 510/2006. ===Design rights=== In the community, registered and unregistered designs protect the product in whole or in part from several aspects of the particular contour, color, shape, structure and/or product characteristics of the product itself or its decoration.Dir 98/71 [1998], Art 1 If the design is novel and can create an overall unique impression that is different from any previous design to the user, the design right can be obtained easily and quickly.Dir 98/71, Art 5 The holder has the right to prohibit third parties from making, providing, placing, importing, exporting, using or storing any product which contains or applies the design.Dir 98/71, Art 12 Besides, Transport within the Community in the case of the commission v FranceCase 23/99 Commission v France [2000] ECR related to Article 30 of the EC Treaty, includes the transport of goods from one Member State to another across the border where one or more Member States are not involved with protected designs. The implementation of the appearance does not constitute the part of the specific theme of both the industrial and commercial property rights in terms of the design. ==European Union Intellectual Property Office== The institutional setting of the European Patent Office (EPO) is made up of the following five division bureaus, headquarters, department, department, and section.Loney, Michael 2018, Christian Archambeau‚Äôs challenges as EUIPO director.

Epo.org. https://www.epo.org/service-support/contact-us/vienna/vienna.html. With branches in Berlin, it undertakes part of management, search, and documentation. The patent protection of European countries through the EPO embraces the following characteristics: * In accordance with the provisions of the European Patent Convention, the patent application can be designated for protection in multiple countries. That means that the European patent may commit the equal effect to a national patent in any or all of the member states. In this case, it is likely that the procedure will be simplified to submit patent applications separately in multiple countries, with the advantage of saving expenses and facilitating applicants; * European patents are approved in accordance with a uniform legal review. They will not render different consequences to the patent law of each country in the aspects of procedures and review requirements. These features guarantee the security of the applicant. The guaranteed efficiency and quality of European patent examinations are made to be faster and more cost-effective compared to the application for a country-by-country application, especially, a business-based increase in the value of inventions; * The European Patent Office utilizes the three languages of English, French and German,Article 14 ‚Äì Languages of the European Patent Office, European patent applications and other documents - The European Patent Convention, Convention on the Grant of European Patents ‚Äì (European Patent Convention), Part I ‚Äì General and institutional provisions, Chapter III ‚Äì The European Patent Office. which extends a larger applicant options to employ the language, aiming to reduce the expense on applying for each language in different languages. * The European Patent Office adopts a separate procedure for search and examination, thus facilitating the timely processing of patent applications by applicants and forging coordinated international patent cooperation treaties on the basis of promoting the submission of applicants for international patent applications.Office E. EPO - The patenting process. Epo.org. https://www.epo.org/learning- events/materials/inventors-handbook/protection/patents.html. * While building up strengthened management, review and retrieval of the bureau, the EPO also embraces a good and extensive cooperative relationship with the government and non-governmental patent agencies. Additionally, a constantly developing and strengthening cooperation is committed to the State Intellectual Property Office in the field of patents. * Billed as the most powerful and modern patent offices in the world, the EPO is endowed with the world's most complete patent documentation resources as it is providing advanced patent information retrieval systems and extensive experience in patent examination, grievance and legal research. Moreover, the collection, retrieval and training of examiners have ensured a lot of assistance to the Chinese Intellectual Property Office. In addition, on a regular basis, the two offices conduct some extensive exchanges in the literature and information products. ==References== ==External links== * Patent Litigation in Europe, Discussion Paper No. 13-072 by the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) Category:Intellectual property law ","title":"European intellectual property law"},{"id":"60359389","text":"Kenneth Algernon Black Jr. (December 23, 1932 ‚Äì January 29, 2019) was an American politician who served in the New Jersey General Assembly from District 3A from 1968 to 1974.

These devices are a newer generation of e-cigarettes that are often marketed to a younger crowd that do not wish to attract attention gained through regular e-cigarettes or traditional tobacco-burning cigarettes. Pod mods contain a disposable cartridge and have coils that cannot be removed or changed.Belluz Julia, (1 May 2018). ‚ÄúJuul, the vape device teens are getting hooked on, explained‚Äù. Vox. Retrieved 12 May 2019. Pod mods were designed to provide higher nicotine delivery with a smaller amount of power than conventional e-cigarettes. Refillable pods can be filled with nicotine salts into empty cartridges with at varying levels of nicotine often at 2.5% and a maximum of 6.0%. The first to introduce pod mods was Pax Labs in June 2015, and since then many companies began introducing similar products. == Influences == === Health === As these devices are created with the intent of replicating smoke produced from traditional cigarettes, they produce greater levels of nicotine than e-cigarettes, however the health risks are currently undetermined as they are new productions. Research reveals potential health risks in aerosolizing nicotine salts and metal toxins that are produced. As there are a variety of different organic compounds put into different flavours, the health risks of these are also unknown and not well-studied. A study revealed that 80% of users ages 15-24 continually use the product after an initial trial as they do not have the adverse effects of traditional cigarettes; these sensations include a burning throat, the distasteful flavour of smoke and the smell left on the body afterward. However, pod mods and e-cigarettes take away some of the difficulties surrounding traditional cigarettes including no smoke, relatively cheaper than tobacco smoke and discrete, leaving a younger demographic more susceptible to addiction. === Science === Co-founders at Solace recreated nicotine salts through a combination of various acids, eventually settling on benzoic acids although many types of acids may be used to created nicotine salts. According to The Verge the first company to utilize nicotine salts in e-liquids was BAT claiming to have used them since 2012 in various products. Traditional e-cigarettes use free-based nicotine liquids, whereas pod mods use nicotine salts which give them a larger dose of nicotine per inhalation.Stumacher, Richard, (21 September 2018). ‚ÄúPod mods and vaping are creating a new generation of youths addicted to nicotine‚Äù. STAT. Retrieved on 12 May 2019. Head of scientific affairs at Imperial Brands Grant O‚ÄôConnell suggests nicotine salts are stronger due to their ability to circulate the body faster from faster absorption in the lungs.Becker, Rachael, (21 November 2018). ‚ÄúNicotine Salts Are Dominating The Market‚Äù. The Verge Retrieved on 12 May 2019. Each milliliter of a pod that uses nicotine of 5% is equivalent to nicotine found in 20 traditional cigarettes. Nicotine salts are created with free base nicotine and benzoic acid to produce an ionized(+) solution that is less volatile- smaller clouds- and less harsh, often described as smooth in anecdotal research. Free-base nicotine found in e-cigarette juice and tobacco cigarettes often stick to the respiratory tract whereas nicotine salts are unlikely to, giving them the higher percentage of nicotine delivery. === Design === Pod mods come in varying shapes and sizes and some are styled after USB flash drives. == Industry regulation == === Concerns === Juul is the leader in the US pod market with 49.6% of the market share. Researchers recently conducted a study that revealed that 63% of participants who have used a Juul (popular pod brand) were not aware that nicotine was present in the product. Literature suggests that the use of pods may be the stepping stone to smoking. There are currently minimal regulations and restrictions on the use of pod mods legally. Due to the unknown nature of first-hand and second-hand inhalation of pod mod usages, some governments and schools are taking preventive action. High nicotine delivery of pod mods leave people potentially more susceptible to nicotine dependency and addiction than smoking cigarettes. Many organizations including Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration‚Äôs National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices aim to educate students and teachers about the health-related risks of using pod mods and such products. === Restriction === In 2018, the FDA (food and Drug Administration) has been urged by public interests and politicians to restrict the sales of pod mods in the United States. In April 2018 the Food and Drug Administration began a nation-wide intervention on the resale of pod mods through websites other than its official site. In addition to this, undercover operations have been conducted to prevent the sales of pods to minors through physical vendors. Some companies have been required to provide information on how their products of pods will not be marketed towards young people and how they will deter these users from their products. == References == Category:Electronic cigarettes Category:Nicotine products with harm-reduction claims ","title":"Pod mod"},{"id":"60359402","text":"Eskew is a surname.

These organized groups hold great relevance to Singaporean modern history. Since 1890, organized groups began fading from Singapore, decline in street organized crime in the past years due to legislation has been put place to ensure authorities suppress the activities of criminal gangs. Contemporary Singapore witnessed a significant rise in other forms of crime ‚Äîorganized cyber-crime. == Historical background == alt= === The first secret society group === Organized criminal gangs existed in Singapore long before the arrival of the British. Formed in 1820, Heaven and Earth Society (Tiandihui) based in Fujian, an offshoot of the Ghee HinKongsi was the first secret group formed in Singapore. === British colony of Singapore === Organized crime was on a steady rise in the following years as a result of immigration triggered by the arrival of the British since 1946. The mass immigration played a crucial role in the economic development during the colonial era by availing large population for labors. However, the rapid growth in the ethnic Chinese population came with cost as secret societies were formed. Immigrants formed their own ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù based on the notion of brotherhood generally known as Hui, which loosely translates into a vast family or company. When joining Hui, one had to cut their fingers with a knife, and the blood that dripped down would be added into rice wine, then it would be drunk as a sign of brotherhood. ==== Early 19th century ==== The formation of this secret society (Hui) played an important role to the immigrants from China during the early 19th century. This group was particularly helpful to these Chinese immigrants during their encounters with colonial government officials who were ignorant of the Chinese language and culture. They would take advantage of these situations to lure the Chinese into joining \\"Hui\\". They offered a source of livelihood to the immigrants, offered protection and most imperatively presided over activities that united them and gave them a sense of belonging and spiritual fulfillment. The Hui were involved in a sourcing of unskilled native labourers as well as other profit making ventures such as pepper and gambier farming. At the beginning of the 19th century Hui adopted a clarion call of mutual assistance, bonding and brotherhood and the colonial government's attitude towards the secret society is ambiguous due to political independence and the inability of the colony's administration. However, by mid 19th century their activities had deteriorated sharply creating impressions of disorder and violence. ==== Mid-19th century ==== Organized crime groups were posing huge problems to the routine and security of people, which forced the British authorities to curb the growing problem. These secret societies intensified their criminal activities from 1850s steadily evolving into organized crimes. They started with simple acts of crime extortion, trafficking and opium dealings before expanding to bigger criminal ventures like running illegal gambling dens and brothels. Organized crime groups started to scuffle with other gangs in order to take over their ‚Äúturf‚Äù and threatened other citizens to pay protection money in return for their so- called ‚Äòprotection‚Äô. The most ferocious organized crime group was GheeHinKongsi; estimated to have 800 members, this group was largely made of the Cantonese. Other secret societies involved in crime include the Hai San, a gang that rivalled the Ghee Hin group in competition for land houses and business opportunities. Major legislative development in the colonial government led to the suppression of secret societies as law enforcement authorities thwarted the activities of organized crime. == Modern trends== In Singapore just like any other country in the world, organized crime is considered a criminal act and includes running unlicensed money lending facilities and operating illegal gambling dens among other crimes. Given the severe penalty attached to them, Singapore records an average low crime rate compared to the rest of the world. However, some smaller groups have come together to form some secret groups that takes after the past secret groups like \\"Hui\\". These groups membership is primarily adolescent teenagers. Singapore has registered an increase in gang related activities in the recent past with drug trafficking being the major organized crime in the recent times owing to its immense profits. Since 1970s these groups have emerged at different times running various illegal activities and engaging in violent activities in the pursuit of their interests which includes unlicensed money lending and drug trafficking. Salakau gang is also another recent example of organized crime. This group drew its members from the Indians and Malays and made huge amounts of money through engaging in extortion and prostitution. Gang rivalry and conflicts between different gangs is a common phenomenon. Even in the present days, there is still a growing number of rebellious youths who subscribe to the ideologies of gang stars thinking being in a gang makes people look cool. A typical example can be traced back to 1990 where some teenagers in ‚Äúpseudo street gangs‚Äù were obsessed with Salaku believing that such an affiliation was cool. These teenagers would be heard chanting the Salakau slogans in their squabbles without being its group members. Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is still considered a primary target for organized cyber criminals in Singapore. This infrastructure includes the Banking and Finance industry which is likely to suffer major losses which may affect the country's economy .An insurance company suffered major losses in 2017 when a group of hackers attacked the company's website leaking personal information for more than 5000 customers. === Organized cyber-crime === Organized cyber-crime in Singapore has been a threat to both private and public sector including government's security agencies. The cyber-attack on the Ministry of Defense in February 2017 was an example of case where a government agency became a target for cyber criminals. Personal details of military personnel were leaked during the attack carried out by hackers. The attack was thwarted before the hackers could access classified military information. Private businesses have also registered losses as a result of cyber-attacks such as the Wannacry Ransomware in 2017 which compelled victims to send a ransom of particular amount to the criminals Secret societies have been using online markets to sell illicit items such as drugs and weapons. This sale is always conducted on the dark web, a collection of encrypted websites that cannot be tracked easily by authorities. According to Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, youths have turned to online markets for drugs such as marijuana. The transactions are carried online through escrow which allows for the payment of contraband. Organized criminal societies have been involved in illicit money lending services on online platforms. These loans are always offered on high rates taking advantage of the victims‚Äô desperation. Since obtaining banks loans is time-consuming and demanding, criminals have resorted to offering loans on the dark web == Decline of organized crime == Since 1890, Singapore has witnessed declining rates of organised crime through the years. This has been made possible by the enactment of strict laws and legislation such as the ‚ÄòSocieties Ordinance Act‚Äô that spelled severe penalties for the offenders. However, there is no denying that organised gangs still exist and it may not be possible to fully wipe them out. The significant decline in gang related activities is attributable to the reforms that have taken place within the law enforcement agencies. The police force has a branch called the Secret Society Branch (SSB) which is mandated primarily to suppress these gangs and destroy them. Among the strategies they employ in dealing with these gangs include surprise raids on their dens deterring any potential offenders. The Singaporean Criminal law dictates that any person found guilty of a criminal offence involving unlawful society is liable to five years of imprisonment and five strokes of cane. In the event that the crime involves a person with authority or a leader within the group then the penalty could be doubled or even tripled. Additionally, certain offences such as drug trafficking are considered capital offences and could lead to death penalty under the penal code. Young offenders below the age of 21 years who join criminal gangs would be liable to life imprisonment while gang robberies would also attract five years behind bars under the code. Accordingly, strict legislation has been the biggest deterrence of criminal gangs effectively and efficiently reducing crime in the country. === Organized Crime Act 2015 === The parliament of Singapore is credited for enacting legislation addressing organized crime in the country. The Organised Crime Act 2015 is one of the recent statutes that was designed to help reduce criminal activities by organized gangs. It took full effect in June 2016 having been passed by the parliament in 2015. The law grants power to law enforcement authorities to detect and prevent criminal activities with minimal interference. Under this law, the public prosecutor is allowed to confiscate assets obtained from criminal activities before sentencing following an application from the High court. This move helps in the investigation of suspected criminals, as they are denied the financial freedom that would jeopardize investigations. Suspected criminals planning to flee overseas using material gains from criminal activities may be apprehended by law enforcement authorities. However, it was worth noting that the public prosecutor has the responsibility to prove that a suspect was involved in criminal activities before being granted permission for civil confiscation. ==== Three preventive orders ==== The Organised Crime Act 2015 also provides for statutory laws that contain preventive orders. These are orders used by the public prosecutor to prevent the likelihood of a suspect engaging in future criminal activities. There are three orders that fall within the preventive orders provided in the act namely disqualification order, financial reporting order and the Organized crime prevention order. The disqualification order restricts suspects from getting involved in the management of companies. If suspects are found guilty, they are automatically disqualified by the court from acting as directors for companies. This order is drawn from the fact that one may use the corporate form as a shield while engaging in criminal activities in the background. The privileges emanating from the limited liability feature of a company may pose a challenge in the investigation of a suspect. Financial reporting order is issued on suspects demanding them to submit their financial reports to relevant authorities. Such orders are issued on individuals serving their sentence and may be extended even after the jail term. The public prosecutor is also legally permitted to demand these reports from suspects who have not been found guilty by the courts. This law prevents the sentenced members of secret societies from funding criminal activities while serving their sentence. Organized crime prevention order grants permission to law enforcement authorities to monitor the activities of suspects including those not found guilty. It has helped reduce organized crime by monitoring the activities of former criminals as well as persons of interest. ==== Opposition from human rights advocate ==== Even though arguments have been made against these laws, Singapore has recorded a sharp decline in the rate of organized crime since 2016. Human rights advocates argue that these laws infringe on the rights of citizens by suppressing their freedom of expression and assembly. The preventive detention permitted by the Criminal Law Act has always been a subject of debate. Critics argue that the warrantless arrest of suspects is subject to abuse by the law enforcement authorities. ==See also== *Secret society *Organized crime == References == Category:Secret societies related to organized crime Category:Crime in Singapore by type Category:Triad (organized crime) ","title":"Organized crime in Singapore"},{"id":"60359487","text":"Roland I de Vaux, Lord of Triermain and Tercrosset, was a prominent 12th- century English noble. ==Biography== Vaux was the illegitimate son of Ranulf de Vaux, Lord of Triermain and Tercrosset, who later succeeded as Baron of Gilsland.The Register of the Priory of St. Bees.

He began his career with Cardiff City where he made his professional debut in 1990. After making three further appearances, he was released by the club and joined Inter Cardiff for the inaugural League of Wales season. After spells with Ton Pentre and Barry Town United, he signed for Cwmbr√¢n Town. During the 1999‚Äì2000 season, he won the League of Wales' Golden Boot as the division's top goalscorer with 28 goals. He went on to play for Merthyr Tydfil, Cwmbr√¢n again, Carmarthen Town and Haverfordwest County before returning to Cwmbr√¢n for a fourth spell in 2002. In his second season, he set a Welsh Premier League record by scoring in eleven consecutive league matches. He briefly played for Cardiff Grange Harlequins in 2005 before dropping into the Welsh Football League with spells at Pontypridd Town, ENTO Aberaman Athletic and Bridgend Town. He scored 177 goals in 243 appearances in the Welsh Premier League which ranks him as the third highest goalscorer in the competition's history. He also represented Wales at semi-professional level. ==Career== Born in Cardiff, Summers represented Wales at youth level. He began his senior career with his hometown side Cardiff City having joined the club on a YTS contract in 1990. He made his professional debut on 3 November 1990 in the Fourth Division as a substitute during a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Maidstone United. He featured as a substitute on two more occasions during November, once in the league and once in the Associate Members' Cup. However, he fell out of favour and made one further appearance in May 1991 before being released at the end of the season. In 1992, he joined Inter Cardiff for the inaugural League of Wales season. He spent two seasons with the side scoring 46 goals across two seasons. He joined Ton Pentre in 1994, scoring eight goals in eight appearances, before joining Barry Town United where he failed to score in four appearances. After a brief spell with Cwmbr√¢n Town in 1996, he returned to the side in 1998 having spent time with Merthyr Tydfil. He scored 21 goals for the club in his first season before winning the League of Wales' Golden Boot award for the league's top goalscorer during the 1999‚Äì2000 season with 28 goals. He played for Carmarthen Town and Haverfordwest County between 2000 and 2002. He returned to Cwmbr√¢n Town for a fourth spell in 2002. During the 2003‚Äì2004 season, Summers set a new club record for Cwmbr√¢n after scoring in six consecutive league matches, achieving the milestone with both goals during a 2‚Äì0 victory over Newtown. He continued his prolific scoring run and went on to break the Welsh Premier League record previously held by Eifion Williams by scoring in eleven consecutive matches. Having equalled the record by scoring in ten consecutive matches against Aberystwyth Town, he set a new record in his eleventh by scoring against Welshpool Town. His scoring exploits lifted Cwmbr√¢n out of the relegation zone, into the top half of the table. Summers later revealed that he had considered quitting football earlier in the season after struggling to maintain his enthusiasm for playing. He commented, \\"I wasn't enjoying my football and was on the verge of jacking it all in.\\" However, discussions with his wife and Cwmbr√¢n manager Brian Coyne prompted him to continue. After a second spell with Carmarthen, Summers dropped out of the Welsh Premier League to join Pontypridd Town but returned at the start of the 2005‚Äì2006 season to sign for Cardiff Grange Harlequins. Summers enjoyed a strong start to the season, scoring six goals in seven matches and was named the league's player of the month in the opening month. However, the club soon encountered financial difficulties and Summers returned to Pontypridd in November 2005. His tally of 177 goals in the Welsh Premier League ranks him as the third highest scorer in the competition's history, behind Marc Lloyd-Williams and Rhys Griffiths. With Pontypridd, he helped the club gain promotion to Division One. When Pontypridd suffered financial difficulties of their own in 2007, Summers moved to ENTO Aberaman Athletic. He later played for Bridgend Town before returning to Pontypridd in 2012. ==Personal life== Alongside playing football, Summers works as a fireman in Caerphilly. ==Honours== * League of Wales Golden Boot winner: 1999‚Äì2000 ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh footballers Category:Footballers from Cardiff Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C. players Category:Ton Pentre F.C. players Category:Barry Town United F.C. players Category:Cwmbr√¢n Town A.F.C. players Category:Carmarthen Town A.F.C. players Category:Haverfordwest County A.F.C. players Category:Pontypridd Town A.F.C. players Category:Aberdare Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Cymru Premier players Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Chris Summers (footballer)"},{"id":"60359929","text":"Niko Sch√§uble (born 29 January 1962 in Stuttgart, Germany) is a German- Australian jazz drummer, composer and sound engineer. ==Biography and work== Sch√§uble studied in Berlin, with Manfred Burzlaff und Konstantinos Avgerinos among others.

When his singing voice was discovered, he studied with in Braunschweig and Hans-Hermann Nissen and Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender in Munich. He was first trained as a bass but later turned to roles for baritone characters. N√∂cker made his stage debut as Alfio in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana at the Theater M√ºnster in 1952. In the 195354 season he was a member of the Stadttheater Gie√üen. From 1954 to 1965, he worked at the Staatsoper Stuttgart, where he took part in the world premieres of Carl Orff's Comoedia de Christi Resurrectione (1957) and his Oedipus der Tyrann (1959). N√∂cker was a member of the ensemble of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich for several decades starting in 1962. He appeared at the house in major roles, including Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca, Wagner roles Klingsor in Parsifal, Telramund in Lohengrin and the title role of Der fliegende Holl√§nder, and Strauss roles Mandryka in Arabella, Jochanaan in Salome and Orest in Elektra. He appeared as Don Pizarro in Beethoven's Fidelio, as Kurwenal in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and as Dr. Sch√∂n in Alban Berg's Lulu. Faithful to the idea of ensemble theatre, he also took small roles. He was an outstanding actor, adding fine humour to Wagner's Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, which he first performed in 1979, and played a cynical Albert in Massenet's Werther and Gunther as a coward in Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung, part of the Ring Cycle production by Nikolaus Lehnhoff. He took part in world premieres at the house, as Hoango in Werner Egk's Die Verlobung in San Domingo in 1963, and in works by G√ºnter Bialas, Wolfgang Fortner, Manfred Trojahn and Aribert Reimann, whose writing for voices he found exceptional. The role of Gloucester in Reimann's Lear in 1978 is remembered as one of his most stirring portrayals. In 1986, he performed in the premiere of Volker David Kirchner's Belshazar. N√∂cker performed at the Bayreuth Festival from 1958, first in small roles such as Hans Schwarz in Die Meistersinger, Melot in Tristan und Isolde and a Knight in Lohengrin, and in 1984 as Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger. At the Schwetzingen Festival, N√∂cker appeared in Gluck's Armida in 1966. He performed there in the premieres of Trojahn's Enrico (1991) and Eckehard Mayer's Sansibar in 1994. At the Salzburg Festival, he sang in a concert performance of Schreker's Die Gezeichneten in 1989. He was a frequent guest at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Cologne Opera, the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf, the Frankfurt Opera and the Hamburg State Opera. In Berlin, he took part in the premiere of Fortner's Elisabeth Tudor in 1972 and Reimann's Die Gespenstersonate in 1984. Outside Germany, he performed as Klingsor at La Fenice in Venice in 1983, at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Edinburgh Festival, La Monnaie in Brussels, the Teatro Massimo in Palermo and the Royal Opera House in London. At the Vienna State Opera, he appeared as Pizarro, Holl√§nder, Telramund, Kurwenal, Gunther, Jochanaan, as the Count in Capriccio by Richard Straus, and Leonardo in Fortner's Bluthochzeit, among others. N√∂cker was also active as a concert singer. He was titled a Bavarian Kammers√§nger in 1966, and in Berlin in 1977.

Solving an image is finding match between the imaged stars and a star catalogue. The solution is a math model describing the corresponding astronomical position of each image pixel. The position of reference catalogue stars has to be known to a high accuracy so an astrometric reference catalogue is used such as the Gaia catalogue. The image solution contains a reference point, often the image centre, image scale, image orientation and in some cases an image distortion model. With the astrometric solution it is possible to: * Calculate the astronomical position of any object on the image. * Synchronize the telescope mount or satellite position to the center of the image taken. In the past, plate solving was done manually by accurately measuring photographic glass plates taken with an astrograph (astrographic camera) Currently, astrometric solving is exclusively done by software programs. The program extracts the star x,y positions from the celestial image, groups them in three-star triangles or four-star quads. Then it calculates for each group a geometric hash code based on the distance and/or angles between the stars in the group. It then compares the resulting hash codes with the hash codes created from catalogue stars to find a match. If it finds sufficient statistically reliable matches, it can calculate transformation factors. The solver should be fast and reliable with no false matches. There are several conventions to model the transformation from image pixel location to the corresponding celestial coordinates. The simplest linear model is called the World Coordinate System. A more advanced convention is SIP (Simple Imaging Polynomial) describing the transformation in polynomials to cope with non-linear geometric distortion in the celestial image, mainly caused by the optics. ==Applications== * Astrometry. Professional setups are using astrometric solving to measure accurately the position of minor planets or comets to calculate orbital parameters. * Telescope Mount pointing. Astrometric solving is used for pointing the telescope mount accurately by syncing it to the celestial position of the image center. ==Blind solving== Some programs don‚Äôt need an initial guess and can do a so called blind solving. They will solve any image having sufficient imaged stars as reference. ==See also== * List of astrometric solvers ==References== ==Further reading== * The Astro Imaging Channel, Bob Denny developed the first totally automated plate solving engine, PinPoint, 18 years ago ==Other Links== * Astrometry Category:Astrometry Category:Astronomical imaging ","title":"Astrometric solving"},{"id":"60360002","text":"Pikuli () is a rural locality (a village) in Polozovoskoye Rural Settlement, Bolshesosnovsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

He is the father of Betawi playboy Oey Tamba Sia, grandfather of bureaucrat and landlord Kapitan Cina Oey Giok Koen, and ancestor of the Oey family of Tigaraksa, a family of the cabang atas Peranakan aristocracy of colonial Indonesia. The atmosphere of Pekalongan Chinatown Oey Thai Lo migrated to Pekalongan, Java, the Dutch East Indies around 1810. According to his descendant Oey Kwie Djien, Oey Thai Lo was the son of a poor Chinese barber. == Career == Local folklore states that Oey Thai Lo found Dutch debt securities at the house of a poor, Javanese farmer. He exchanged the securities for money, which gave him the initial capital for his tobacco business empire. According to Thio Tjin Boen's Tjerita Oeij Se, Oey Thai Lo moved from Pekalongan to Batavia because of the embarrassment of his daughter's inter-ethnic marriage to an indigenous man, namely the son of the Regent of Pekalongan, which was frowned upon by the local Chinese community. In Batavia, Oey was known for philanthropy and eventually became friends with Tan Eng Goan, Majoor der Chinezen, head of the Chinese government administration in Batavia. Oey provided financial support to the Majoor, who had financial difficulties. Because of his services to the Majoor and his charity work towards for people of Batavia, Oey Thai Lo was given the position of Luitenant der Chinezen in the Kongsi Besar area. ==Legacy== Oey married a local Peranakan woman, who gave birth to a daughter and three sons: Oey Holland, Oey Tamba and Oey Macau. Luitenant Oey Thai Lo died around 1838 in Batavia, and passed down a supposed inheritance of 2 million guilders for his children. One of his children, Oey Tamba Sia, gained notoriety for his womanizing, and more fatally for masterminding several murders, which he tried to impute to his social rival Lim Soe Keng Sia, the Majoor's son-in-law. After he was convicted, the young Oey was sentenced to hang by the Dutch East Indies government. The life story of Luitenant Oey Thai Lo and his son Oey Tamba Sia formed the basis of many Chinese-Malay literary works, and are part of Betawi folklore. Through his youngest son, Oey Macau Sia, Luitenant Oey Thai Lo is the grandfather of Oey Giok Koen, who served as Kapitein der Chinezen of Tangerang and bought the particuliere land (private domain) of Tigaraksa.

The regulations addressing the ODA program are found in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 183, subpart D, sections 183.41 through 813.67. The FAA asserted that the ODA program does not introduce any type of self-certification. However, the practice has been criticized for substantial manufacturer influence over personnel designation and design certification, particularly after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery fires in 2013 and the Boeing 737 MAX groundings in 2019. == Purpose == \\"The ODA program expands the scope of approved tasks available to organizational designees; increases the number of organizations eligible for organizational designee authorizations; and establishes a more comprehensive, systems-based approach to managing designated organizations.\\" The ODA program was created for the FAA to standardize the operation and oversight of organizational designees. This program aims to \\"increase the efficiency with which the FAA appoints and oversees designee organizations, and allow the FAA to concentrate its resources on the most safety-critical matters.\\" == Types of Organizational Designation Authorizations == The following are the different types of Organizational Designation Authorizations for which qualified organizations may apply. * Type Certification ODA (TC ODA) * Supplemental Type Certification ODA (STC ODA) * Production Certification ODA (PC ODA) * Parts Manufacturer Approval ODA (PMA ODA) * Technical Standard Order Authorization Holder ODA (TSOA ODA) * Major Repair, Alteration, and Airworthiness ODA (MRA ODA) * Airman Knowledge Testing ODA (AKT ODA) * Air Operator ODA (AO ODA) ==History== In the \\"VISION 100‚ÄîCENTURY OF AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\\" of 2003, legislators passed a section entitled \\"DESIGN ORGANIZATION CERTIFICATES\\", which instructed the FAA to deputize designers, so that the designers would \\"certify compliance with the requirements and minimum standards... for the type certification of aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, or appliances.\\" In 2005, the FAA granted Boeing \\"in-house oversight for new planes in production and approval of major repairs and alterations\\". The manufacturers‚Äô engineer is delegated to review the design, plan and observe tests, and certify they meet applicable standards. FAA staff do attend \\"many critical tests involving safety issues ‚Äî such as flammability of new materials and design of flight controls\\". The ODA status is granted for an aircraft manufacturer to act as the proxy on certification oversight. Previous to the ODA programme, \\"engineers in that role were approved by and reported directly to the FAA\\". In 2011, Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety Margaret Gilligan issued National Policy Order 8100.15A to establish the \\"procedures, guidance, and limitations of authority\\" the FAA grants to an organization under the ODA program. Order 8100.15A was 293 pages long and composed of 16 chapters and seven appendices. The legislative authority for the ODA program was derived under Title 49 of the US Code ¬ß 44702: Issuance of Certificates, which authorized the FAA to \\"delegate to a qualified private person a matter related to issuing certificates, or related to the examination, testing, and inspection necessary to issue a certificate on behalf of the FAA Administrator\\". The FAA established the ODA program in 14 CFR part 183, subpart D: Representatives of the Administrator. Boeing has 1,500 people in its ODA, under supervision by an FAA team of 45 people, of which only 24 are engineers. By 2018, the FAA was letting Boeing certify 96 percent of its own work. === Historical examples === The Boeing 737 series had suffered from rudder issues in the past, resulting in several accidents. A previous model of the 737 also experienced a similar mix of questionable safety assessment, insufficient pilot training, and automated system malfunction when Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 crashed. In February 2020, Boeing and NTSB officials refused to cooperate with a new Dutch lawmakers inquiry. In November 2019, the online media \\"The Air Current\\" reviewed historical parallels between the MAX and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which had been grounded after the crash of American Airlines Flight 191. A safety panel was convened by the FAA under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences to investigate both the design of the DC-10 and the regulatory system itself. In its report, published in June 1980, the safety panel highlighted the FAA's reliance on the manufacturer during the certification process and the fact that in most cases it performs only a \\"cursory review\\" of the manufacturer's information. The New York Times noted that the panel found \\"critical deficiencies in the way the Government certifies the safety of American-built airliners\\". For Marian Pistik, head of asset management at International Airfinance Corporation, the case of the MAX is unprecedented due to allegations of wrongdoings. The groundings of the DC-10 and of the Dreamliner could not be directly compared to the global B737 MAX grounding: \\"there was no suspicion that Boeing or any OEM knew of the problem and tried to disguise it or [‚Ä¶] any suspicion of wrongdoing or not being compliant or forthcoming with the issues of the 737 Max.\\" == Oversight of delegation policies by SOCAC == The Safety Oversight and Certification Advisory Committee (SOCAC) was created by the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. The committee will provide advice to the Secretary of Transportation on policies related to FAA safety oversight and certification programs and activities, utilization of delegation and designation authorities. ==Controversies== The ODA process has been criticized as detrimental to safety. Since 2012, the FAA had successfully pushed to increase the scope of delegating safety checks to the manufacturer. On 4 February 2013, an article in the Seattle Times written by journalist Kyung Song critiqued the process by which the airworthiness certificate was obtained for the Boeing 787 because approvals for the Lithium Ion battery system were akin \\"to the fox guarding the chicken coop\\". In the words of an onlooker, \\"Song stated that Boeing became an FAA designee [sic] with wide latitude in picking the company‚Äôs own engineers to sign off on their employer‚Äôs work on behalf of the FAA\\". In April 2019, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Elaine L. Chao, who boarded a MAX flight on March 12 amid calls to ground the aircraft created the Special Committee to Review the FAA's Aircraft Certification Process to review of Organization Designation Authorization, which granted Boeing authority to review systems on behalf of the FAA, during the certification of the 737 MAX 8. The committee recommended integrating human performance factors and consider all levels of pilot experience, but defended the ODA against any reforms. Relatives of those on board the accident flights condemned the report for calling the ODA an \\"effective\\" process. In June 2020, the United States Senate criticized the FAA for failing to turn over 737 MAX documents and accused the FAA of trying \\"to keep us in the dark\\". The U.S. Inspector General said that by 2017, Boeing was handling all certification checks on behalf of the FAA. === FAA response to criticisms of excessive delegation === In response to questions from Project On Government Oversight, a FAA spokesperson said ‚ÄúFAA has never allowed companies to police themselves or self-certify their aircraft. With strict FAA oversight, delegation [of certification] extends the rigor of the FAA certification process to other recognized professionals, thereby multiplying the technical expertise focused on assuring an aircraft meets FAA standards.‚Äù In May 2020, the FAA announced a reform of existing processes to improve management of aircraft development and corporate practices. In June 2020, a Senate Bill calling for changes to the existing ODA is being drafted to resolve potential conflict of interest between Boeing, FAA, designated representatives and whistleblowers. FAA Director Steve Dickenson admitted that \\"mistakes were made\\" with the 737 MAX and that the implications of MCAS were not fully understood. In August 2020, the FAA imposed a $1.2 million fine on Boeing for exerting undue pressure on designated inspectors to expedite aircraft approvals. == Further reading == * ==References== Category:Federal Aviation Administration Category:Aviation safety ","title":"Organization Designation Authorization"},{"id":"60360201","text":"John Cadeli√±a is an Filipino Pop Christian singer and also an arranger of gospel songs.

He served two terms as the country's permanent representative to the United Nations, and was also secretary-general of the South Pacific Commission from 1982 to 1986. ==Early life== Bugotu was born in Guadalcanal. He attended St. Mary's School, Maravovo, and All Hallows' School, Ugi Island. He later completed further studies in New Zealand at St. Stephen's College, Auckland, and Ardmore Teachers' Training College. Bugotu taught at All Hallows' School for one year before becoming a schools inspector with the Diocese of Melanesia (1959‚Äì1960). He was appointed to the Legislative Council of the Solomon Islands in 1960, serving until 1962. ==Academia== Bugotu became an officer in the Education Department in 1962, and in 1964 moved to Scotland to attend Moray House School of Education, completing a diploma in the teaching of English as a second language. He lectured at the British Solomons Training College from 1964 to 1968, and also carried out research into the Lengo (Tadhimboko) language. He attended a three-month course at the University of Queensland in 1967, and from 1970 to 1971 studied at the University of Lancaster in England, becoming the first Solomon Islander to complete a Master of Arts degree. ==Public life== In the years leading up to independence in 1978, Bugotu held a number of senior positions in the Solomon Islands Public Service. He was chairman of the Review Committee on Education (1974‚Äì1975), Permanent Secretary for Education and Cultural Affairs, and Permanent Secretary to the Council of Ministers. After independence, he became the inaugural secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was a \\"roving ambassador and high commissioner\\". At his own suggestion, he was simultaneously accredited to the U.S., the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, West Germany, Sweden, the UN, and the European Economic Community. This model was subsequently taken up by several other small countries. Bugotu was the inaugural Permanent Representative of the Solomon Islands to the United Nations, and accompanied Prime Minister Peter Kenilorea at the ceremony celebrating the country's admission as the 150th UN member. In July 1982, he was chosen as Secretary-General of the South Pacific Commission, the first Solomon Islander to hold the position. He was responsible for the organisation's decision to allow non-sovereign states to join, thereby significantly increasing its membership. His term was extended by two years in October 1984, the first time that had occurred. In 1990, Bugotu was reappointed Permanent Representative to the UN and also accredited as Ambassador to the U.S. and Canada. He died of a heart attack in 1992, aged 55, while attending the South Pacific Forum in Honiara. He was replaced by colleague diplomat Bernard Bata'anisia in New York from August 1992. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from Guadalcanal Province Category:Permanent Representatives of the Solomon Islands to the United Nations Category:Ambassadors of the Solomon Islands Category:Ambassadors of the Solomon Islands to the United States Category:Alumni of Lancaster University Category:Members of the Legislative Council of the Solomon Islands Category:Solomon Islands civil servants Category:Pacific Community people ","title":"Francis Bugotu"},{"id":"60360353","text":"Cyclopelta siccifolia is a bug in the family Dinidoridae found in South Asia.

In 1802, his father was installed as the Temenggong by Sultan Mahmud Ri‚Äôayat Shah after the death of his grandfather Temenggong Abdul Jamal. However only a year later in 1803, his father died and the Sultan installed his uncle Engku Muda Muhammad as the Temenggong. Engku Muda Muhammad himself rejected the position and wanted the position of Yang Dipertuan Muda instead, but the Sultan would not approve. In 1806, Abdul Rahman was installed as Temenggong of Johor after his uncle's death by the Sultan at Lingga. Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his family and followers later moved to Singapura in 1811 to establish a governance there. By the time Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapura on 29 January 1819, there were an estimated 1,000 people there. There Raffles befriended Temenggong Abdul Rahman who lived near the river (present day Singapore River). Due to him being the staunch supporter of Tengku Hussein Shah, the Temenggong helped Raffles to smuggle Hussein from Riau to Singapura. Raffles offered to recognize Hussein Shah as the rightful Sultan of Johor, and provide him with a yearly payment, but in return, Hussein would grant the British East India Company the right to establish the island as a trading post. On 6 February 1819, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, with Hussein Shah signed the Treaty with Raffles and Major William Farquhar, marking Singapore as a British settlement. In the agreement, Sultan Hussein Shah received a yearly sum of 5,000 Spanish dollars, while the Temenggong himself received a yearly sum of 3,000 Spanish dollars and was therefore granted the hereditary style of His Highness by the British on 30 February 1819. In 1823, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, his family and followers moved to the 200 acres of land (part of Teluk Belanga area) as allocated by Raffles. Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein were called upon to sign the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the British Government at the Government Hill on 2 August 1824. In the agreement, the Sultan received 33,200 Spanish dollars and a monthly allowance of 1,300 Spanish dollars for life, while the Temenggong received a monthly stipend of 700 Spanish dollars in addition to a lump sum of 26,800 Spanish dollars, and agreed to maintain free trade in their possessions but were forbid to have any correspondence with foreigners without the EIC‚Äôs permission. ==Death== Temenggong Abdul Rahman died in his house Istana Lama at Teluk Belanga in 8 December 1825 and was buried at the nearby Makam Diraja Teluk Blangah.

Reviewing the second edition in 2002, Wojciech Orli≈Ñski called it \\"the most interesting of all monographies about Lem\\" and a \\"brilliant interview\\". ==Content== The book is composed of the following chapters: * Czas nie ca≈Çkiem utracony (1987 edition title) / Czas nieutracony (2002 edition title). Lit. Time [not fully] lost. This chapter was partially censored in the 1987 edition, which have removed parts about Soviet- occupied era Lw√≥w of WWII where Lem grew up. * W pajƒôczej sieci. Lit In the spider's web. * O Golemie osobno (1987 edition title) / Golem (2002 edition title). Lit Separately about Golem. * Rozczarowania filmowe. Lit. Film disappointments. * Gusta i dysgusta. Lit. Likes and dislikes. * Ksiƒôga skarg i wniosk√≥w. Lit. Book of complains and suggestions. * W cywilizacyjnej jamie. Lit. In the cave of civilization. * Czarna bezwyj≈õciowo≈õƒá sytuacji. Lit. Black no-exits of the situation. This chapter, discussing recent events in Poland, was entirely removed by censors in the 1987 edition. * Wyja≈õniaƒá ≈õwiat. Lit. Explain the world. * Pasja filozofowania. Lit. Passion of philosophizing. * Lube czasy. Lit. Good times. This is one of the three new chapters added to the 2002 edition. * Wizja lokalna. Lit. Local vision. This is one of the three new chapters added to the 2002 edition. * Summa, czyli panta rhei. Lit. Summa, or panta rhei. This is one of the three new chapters added to the 2002 edition. ==Influence== While Bere≈õ' interview was never fully translated to English, in the early 1990s Lem met with the literary scholar and critic Peter Swirski for a series of extensive interviews, published with other critical materials and translations in English as A Stanislaw Lem Reader (1997). In 2005 Bere≈õ published another book-length interview, Historia i fantastyka, this time with Polish fantasy writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Wojciech Orli≈Ñski in his review of Historia i fantastyka notes that comparing it with the Lem's interview from 1980s it allows for a study of how Polish science fiction and fantasy has changed over those two decades. ==See also== *Bibliography of Stanis≈Çaw Lem#Interviews, other interviews with Lem ==References== Category:1987 non-fiction books Category:Stanis≈Çaw Lem interviews Category:Polish non-fiction books Category:Censored books ","title":"Rozmowy ze Stanis≈Çawem Lemem"},{"id":"60360537","text":"Yurkovo () is a rural locality (a selo) in Bolshesosnovskoye Rural Settlement, Bolshesosnovsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

The estimated magnitude is 7.5‚Äì8.0 , with an epicentre close to Simeulue, off Sumatra. It triggered a widespread and damaging tsunami that caused at least 2,188 deaths. The low observed intensity compared to the size of the tsunami has led to its interpretation as a tsunami earthquake. Higher levels of shaking observed on Nias are attributed to a large aftershock, less than an hour later. The tsunami gave rise to the S'mong legend, which is credited with saving many lives during the 2004 earthquake. == Tectonic setting == Sumatra lies above the convergent plate boundary, where the Australia Plate is being subducted beneath the Sunda Plate along the Sunda megathrust. The convergence on this part of the boundary is highly oblique and the strike-slip component of the plate motion is accommodated along the right-lateral Great Sumatran Fault. Movement on the Sunda megathrust has caused many great earthquakes. == Earthquake == This earthquake has been regarded as anomalous, in comparison to other Sunda megathrust events, due to the small amount of observed shaking compared to the scale of the triggered tsunami. Both the location of the epicentre and the magnitude of the earthquake are uncertain. ===Aftershocks=== Re-examination of seismometer recordings identified a second earthquake about 53 minutes after the mainshock. This aftershock was responsible for the intense shaking reported from Nias. A magnitude of 7.1 has been estimated for this event. Two other significant aftershocks have also been identified from seismograph records and a further 19 events are known from contemporary reports. ===Epicentral location=== Many estimates have been made for the epicentre of this earthquake. Most of the early estimates of the location place it in the outer rise of the subducting plate rather than on the plate interface. Such earthquakes can generate tsunamis, but are highly unlikely to be tsunami earthquakes. More recent estimates give a range of epicentres, including some located on a shallow part of the megathrust, although the uncertainties remain large. Martin et al. (2019) give their preferred location as just west of Simeulue, coincident with a major barrier to rupture propagation along the megathrust caused by a ridge associated with a fracture zone on the subducting plate. This location is in a similar part of the megathrust as the epicentre of the 2010 Mentawai tsunami earthquake. ===Magnitude=== There are sufficient instrumental recordings preserved for this earthquake to allow an estimate of its magnitude. A range of 7.5‚Äì8.0 has been estimated from the seismographs, a magnitude that is insufficient to explain the observed tsunami. The surface wave magnitude for this earthquake was calculated from seismic waves with a period up to 40 seconds. For a tsunami earthquake however, a large part of the energy release is at much longer periods (lower frequencies). Observations of the amplitude of Rayleigh and Love waves have been used to estimate a seismic moment () of for periods in the range 100‚Äì160 seconds (6‚Äì10 MHz), equivalent to of 8.2. These observations also demonstrate an increase in moment with increasing period and the longest available period of 170 seconds suggests a value for of about 8.4. ===Fault model=== The nature of the earthquake matches well with a fault model that involves slip on the uppermost part of the megathrust, consistent with the location of other tsunami earthquakes. A rupture length of about 250 km and a down-dip extent of up to 80 km combined with a maximum slip of 21 m is capable of generating the observed tsunami. == Tsunami == The tsunami that accompanied this earthquake was observed as far away as Sri Lanka, R√©union and Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It was most destructive along the coast of Simeulue. It gave rise to the S'mong legend amongst the Simeuluean people, which persisted through oral tradition. In 2004 the S'mong is credited with saving the lives of many people on Simeulue and neighbouring Nias as inhabitants ran to higher ground following the earthquake. There are few reliable run-up measurements, but the scale of the tsunami has been estimated from reports of inundations on both Simeulue and Nias. The maximum observed inundation was 2‚Äì3 km at Lakubang on the southern coast of Simeulue and a maximum estimated run-up in the range 7 m‚Äì15 m based on reports of the loss of coconut palms on the small island of Pulau Wunga off northwestern Nias. ==Damage== Due to the relatively low level of shaking associated with the mainshock, almost all the damage and casualties were a result of the tsunami. The Nias aftershock, in contrast, damaged many buildings on that island. The number of casualties based on contemporary reports are 370 on Nias and a minimum of 1,818 on Simeulue. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Tsunami earthquakes Category:1907 earthquakes Category:Earthquakes in Indonesia ","title":"1907 Sumatra earthquake"},{"id":"60360624","text":"Boroduli () is a rural locality (a village) and the administrative center of Borodulskoye Rural Settlement, Vereshchaginsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

As its title implies, part of it is a parody of Patrick Hernandez's 1978 disco hit \\"Born to Be Alive\\", featuring the lyrics to \\"Esci dalla tua terra\\" (translatable as \\"Walk out of your land\\"), a 1973 Christian pop worship song by missionary Gigi Cocquio, about Abraham. The medley also includes fragments from an older (1969) worship song, priest/musician Domenico Machetta's \\"Resta con noi, Signore, la sera\\" (translatable as \\"Abide with us, O Lord, in the evening\\"), mixed with \\"Resta cu'mme\\" (\\"Stay with me\\" in Neapolitan), a 1957 hit by Domenico Modugno, as well as the chorus from Sylvester's 1978 song \\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\\", again sung with lyrics from \\"Esci dalla tua terra\\". According to comments by the band within the CD booklet for the first pressing of their 1997 greatest hits compilation Del meglio del nostro meglio Vol. 1, the medley was meant to satirize the musical stiffness of Italian worship songs rather than the Catholic Church, as well as the possible dilution of Christian-themed messages through musically hackneyed, trivial songs, with band leader Elio jokingly stating that the Church would increase its popularity among younger generations of worshippers if Christian songs actually sounded the way the band performed them. As of 2019, the song is officially available only in a slightly different version, re-recorded by the band in 1997 as a duet with Hernandez, for Del meglio del nostro meglio Vol. 1; the original 1990 single was withdrawn within two months from its release, because the Italian branch of Jehovah's Witnesses took issues with its parodic cover artwork, and became a collector's item. ==The song== \\"Born to Be Abramo\\" consists of two separate parts, linked together by spoken word and keyboard/guitar interludes. === Introduction and first half === The song starts with a spoken introduction by the band's keyboard player Sergio Conforti (a.k.a. Rocco Tanica), acting out the role of a seminarian talking to a group of people from a small church community, reminding them that subscriptions for an upcoming chestnut-gathering trip to the fictional \\"Filzetta Valley\\" (named after a type of cured pork meat) are being taken by \\"Father Egidio\\" in the parish, and warning \\"the usual smart alecks\\" that \\"no mass, no trip\\". A strummed acoustic guitar is heard while he finishes talking, but it is immediately interrupted by a four-on-the-floor bass drum and a sampled voice singing \\"Elio, Elio, E-E-E-E-E Elio (e le Storie Tese)\\" over a two-note melody. The voice belongs to producer Claudio Dentes's Filipino butler, known as \\"Tremoto\\", whose introduction for the band (in his own language) was used on their first album. The stuttering sample, which was devised by bassist Nicola Fasani (a.k.a. Faso) and reappears throughout the medley, gives way to a disco beat and a synth strings passage by Conforti, paraphrasing the intro to Renato Zero's 1978 disco hit \\"Triangolo\\". This is followed by Elio singing, alternately, a line from \\"Resta cu'mme\\" (in a disco arrangement originally created in 1976 for, and made famous by, Marcella Bella) followed by a line from \\"Resta con noi, Signore, la sera\\" and, in the second verse, quoting more extensively from both songs (namely, two lines from Machetta's song, followed by three lines from Modugno's ‚Äì the third of which gets interrupted by a Machetta quote ‚Äì and three more lines from Modugno). The section ends with a reprise of the \\"E-E-E-Elio\\" sample melody. === Second half === The second half starts with guitarist Davide Civaschi (a.k.a. Ces√†reo) playing the guitar intro from \\"Born to Be Alive\\", over which Conforti (in the same voice as earlier) says: \\"Among other things, it is useless to rehearse the choir on Wednesday evening if on Sunday the only people singing are the usual three ‚Äì sorry for using this word ‚Äì morons!\\" Elio then sings (only) the lyrics to \\"Esci dalla tua terra\\" over the melody and the arrangement to \\"Born to Be Alive\\", thus creating a mashup which also includes the title phrase (obviously absent from Cocquio's song), parodied as \\"Born to be Abramo\\". The first two verses of both songs (Cocquio's lyrics over Hernadez's melody) are used in full, before Elio briefly deviates into two lines from \\"Esci dalla tua terra\\" using Cocquio's original melody. This is followed by the chorus lyrics to Cocquio's song [\\"Esci dalla tua terra e va' dove ti porter√≤\\" and \\"Parola di Jahv√®\\", i.e. \\"Walk out of your land and go where I shall bring you\\" / \\"Jehovah's word\\"] (sung by multi-instrumentalist Paolo Panigada (a.k.a. Feiez) in a falsetto voice, in the style of Sylvester), over the chorus melody of \\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\\". After this, Panigada ends the song by continuing to sing Sylvester's melody using Cocquio's lyrics and adding some of his own, including a reference to \\"Bhagwan [i.e. Rajneesh], who's just died\\" (the Indian guru had indeed passed away less than one month before the band started recording the song). In the 1997 re-recording, the \\"who's just died\\" part was omitted and replaced with \\"or Sai Baba\\". As a coda, Conforti talks again with no music (in the same role as above) and says the following: \\"And one last thing: those little 13/14-year-old ladies who come into the oratory all made-up like cabaret singers should know that this is neither the place nor the occasion to devote themselves to certain activities, because we are here to grow up, to become adults, to build a community and become one another's neighbor. All of us know that today's young people are vulnerable, when...\\" [fades out]. None of Conforti's spoken parts were included on the 1997 re-recording. ==B-side== The B-side to the original 12\\" single is another medley, consisting of the songs \\"World Class Player\\" and \\"John Holmes (Una vita per il cinema) [Shidzu version]\\". === \\"World Class Player\\" === \\"World Class Player\\" is a literal English translation (sung by Elio in his usually exaggerated, totally non-English Italian accent) of \\"Giocatore mondiale\\", the band's signature tune for Quasi gol [\\"Almost a goal\\"], a 1990 radio show by Gialappa's Band (the comedic trio's first recurring show, where they provided their own humorous commentary to football matches in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, complete with sampled voices and comical sound effects). The song is a satire of Italian \\"football mania\\" and features an intervention by the wheelchair- bound singer-songwriter Pierangelo Bertoli, who sings three lines (in Italian) parodying his own involvement in an earlier public service announcement about architectural barriers. The Italian version of the song would later feature as a B-side on \\"Saturday Night Strage\\" (a house remix of \\"Born to Be Abramo\\") and reprinted in the CD release of the band's mini-album The Los Sri Lanka Parakramabahu Brothers Featuring Elio e le Storie Tese; this English version remained unreleased on CD. The lyrics were literally translated by Elio from Italian to English; as a result of this, in several occasions Elio is forced to speed up his delivery of the lyrics in order to stay within the original melody. At one point, he is heard swearing after he misses his cue on a chorus. === \\"John Holmes (Una vita per il cinema) [Shidzu version]\\" === The medley segues (without stopping) into the backing instrumental track from \\"John Holmes (Una vita per il cinema)\\" [\\"A life devoted to cinema\\"], a song from the band's Elio samaga hukapan kariyana turu album about the well-known American pornographic actor, overlaid with a Japanese song, performed by singer Ayako Handa and taken from a Noh play; the song itself is called \\"Ogi no Mato\\" (which translates to \\"The Folding Fan as a Target\\") and was also featured in the 1982 film Blade Runner as the soundtrack to a mock-Japanese advert ‚Äì intended as a parody of an actual Japanese ad for a contraceptive pill. According to comments made by the band within their own radio show Cordialmente, on Radio Deejay, the combination was accidentally created in the studio: while producer Dentes and mixing engineer MC Costa were listening to a rough mix of the backing track to \\"John Holmes\\", sound engineer Maurizio Camagna loaded a Japanese theatre CD on a player and pressed \\"Play\\" without having any idea about what Dentes and Costa were doing. The Japanese song ended up being fed into the console, and the result cracked up Dentes, Costa and the band so much that they decided to release it the way it was, as a bonus track on the album's CD release, titled \\"John Holmes [Shidzu version]\\". ==Artwork controversy and withdrawal== Before recording the single, the band did not ask permission from any of the involved songwriters to use their material, but most of them were not concerned at all, except for \\"Resta cu'mme\\" lyricist Dino Verde, who did not like the religious associations brought by the band to his lyrics and accused them of outright thievery of other people's work. On the other hand, Gigi Cocquio appreciated the band's parody of his song and complimented them. However, the Italian branch of Jehovah's Witnesses were irritated by the artwork for the single, a parodic remake of a cover picture from Svegliatevi!, the Italian edition of Awake!; the remake consisted in a doctored rendition of an actual cover from the magazine, with the headline \\"What Chances are There for a Longer Life?\\" and a picture of an elderly lady holding an infant baby in her arms ‚Äì but the baby's head had been replaced by Pel√©'s head, with surreally yellow hair. The artwork also featured the nonsense heading Sveliatevi!, omitting the G from the original heading in order to include the O of the name \\"elio\\" (all in lowercase) within the lowercase A. The Witnesses complained that the band had completely misunderstood their message, while in fact they did not care at all about \\"the message\\": the artwork was, indeed, intended to mock the perceived silliness of that particular cover picture, rather than the movement itself. As a result of the Witnesses' complaint, the single was withdrawn from sales within less than two months from its release, it was never reprinted and became a collector's item. The back cover is an anonymous Bible illustration in the style of Gustave Dor√©, depicting Abraham, five other men (one of which, on the far right, is only partly seen because of the way the picture is cropped), a crowd in the background and a football, added in by means of CGI. The first of two captions next to a small outline drawing, below the main picture, correctly identifies Abraham as the figure on the far left, but the second one jokingly refers to the other five men (plus a single man in the crowd) as members of Elio e le Storie Tese. ==Foonotes== ==ReferencesCategory:1990 singles Category:Epic Records singles ","title":"Born to Be Abramo"},{"id":"60360670","text":"Karen Naimer is a Canadian lawyer and director of the program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones for Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), a US-based NGO. == Education == Naimer is a lawyer by profession and a BA graduate from McGill University; holds an MA from the University of Toronto; a JD from the University of Toronto Faculty of Law; and an LLM from New York University School of Law.

Robertson House is a single-family home located at 412 South Clinton Street in Albion, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. ==History== Eugene P. Robertson was born in Albion in 1841. Robertson began working Mayhew & Irwin, a local private banking firm, in 1863. By 1877, he was cashier of the Albion Exchange Bank owned by J. W. Sheldon. About the same time, likely in 1875, Robertson built this house for his family. Robertson went on to serve as the mayor of the City of Albion in 1890, as treasurer of the Michigan Bankers Association in 1891 and 1892, and was elected treasurer of Albion College. In 1894, bank owner J. W. Sheldon died, and in 1895 Robertson established the Albion State Bank. He served as president of the bank until at least 1913. Robertson lived in the house until his death in 1916, and the house remained in the family until the death of his widow, Carrie L. Robertson, in 1923. It was later turned into apartments. ==Description== The Eugene P. Robertson House is a two-story, red brick Italianate structure with a T-shaped main section and a slightly lower rear addition. The house originally had a small Italianate front porch and double entry doors. Around 1900 these were replaced with a broad bracketed veranda supported by square wood posts on a cement block base, and a single front door with sidelights. The windows have highly ornamental carved stone caps with keystones and corbels and incised detailing. Two bay windows have paneled aprons, round-corner windows, and bracketed cornices. The house has a low pitch hip roof with paneled soffit windows and paired-bracket cornice supports. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1875 ","title":"Eugene P.

Its main block has three main storeys, with a raised cellar that opens onto the shaped water gardens on its south side. It was designated a Category A listed building in 1972. ==Description== Letterfourie House, one of the largest Georgian houses in Moray, lies above the Burn of Buckie, about a mile east of Drybridge in the parish of Rathven. The building consists of a central block built of pink pinned tooled granite, with pavilion wings of harl pointed rubble connected to the main house by three-bay linking blocks, all set out at right angles in a U-plan. ===North Elevation=== The north side of the main block presents as a three-bay, three storey building, the main entrance having a Corinthian columned porch, approached by a shallow flight of stairs, necessitated by the raised basement. The principal windows have architraves and blind balustraded aprons. ===South Elevation=== The south side of the house faces onto the gardens. From this side, the basement appears to the south of the house as a lower ground floor level, and so from the south each element of the house presents four storeys, with a central entrance to the basement level, with decorative fanlight, leading giving access to the gardens. The upper three storeys have five bays, and the blocked central window on the upper floor has a dated keystone. The basement chapel has two large, round headed windows, with intersecting astragals at their heads. ===Interior=== The interior design has been described as excellent. The principal rooms are lined with Spanish mahogany, which the Gordon brothers had sent back from Madeira where they had made their fortune in the wine trade. The main north entrance leads into and east‚Äìwest aligned entrance hall, with a cantilevered staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The dining room, looking onto the garden, is lined with mahogany, and features a fireplace with white a marble chimney piece and an unusual steel basket grate by James Fraser of Banff, which has a curved, decorated front which can be retracted to avoid soiling from overheating. Fine chimney pieces and fireplaces can also be found in the library, and in the first floor drawing room which also features original hand-painted wallpaper and fine, early- to mid-nineteenth century plasterwork. The former chapel, which no longer has any of its original fittings, has a groined, vaulted ceiling, and is flanked by engaged, fluted pilasters. ===Gardens=== There is a shaped water garden to the south side of the house. Installed in the early to mid-nineteenth Century, it has two round pools linked by a narrow canal. Each pool features a fountain, with square plinths and wide, scalloped bowls. There is also a large walled garden approximately 450 metres from the house, with a former garden room and orangery. ===Craigmin Bridge=== Within the grounds of the house, Craigmin Bridge carries what was once the main carriageway leading to the house over the Burn of Letterfourie. Probably designed by Adam at the same time as the house, its significance is recognised in its individual Category A listing. ==History== Letterfourie House was built as a home for two bachelor brothers from the Gordon family to retire to upon their return to Scotland. James Gordon was a wine trader who had established himself in Madeira, and Alexander had been a Jacobite who had been forced to flee Scotland for a time following the Battle of Culloden. They commissioned Robert Adam to build the house; work started in 1772, and it was completed in 1773. It was the first house Adam built in Scotland after returning from his Grand Tour, and the Sir John Soane‚Äôs Museum holds his original designs for it. The Gordon brothers were staunchly Roman Catholic, and the house was built at a time when Catholics were not permitted to worship publicly, so the house was built to include a private chapel and accommodation for a priest. The reel The House of Letterfourie, also known as 'Lasses look behind you', by William Marshall of Fochabers, is named for the house. The house was designated as a Category A listed building in 1972. == References == Category:Category A listed buildings in Moray Category:Country houses in Moray Category:Robert Adam buildings Category:Georgian architecture in Scotland ","title":"Letterfourie House"},{"id":"60360750","text":"is a Japanese television jidaigeki or period drama that was broadcast in 1986.

The Gull Wing Group organizes car-related events including, driving tours, an annual convention with technical sessions and driver's education, social events and similar activities around the world. The organization has an international membership of approximately 600 members from 25 countries. As of 2019, Southern California is the largest region with 150 active members. Membership is open to anyone. ==History== The Gull Wing Group International started with eighteen Mercedes 300SL enthusiasts on August 1961 by Ernie Spitzer, an entrepreneur who owned a commercial printing business. The first meeting was held in Palo Alto, California at Ricky's Studio Inn and Hotel. By the end of 1961, the club had expanded to 38 dues paying members. A year later, the members and their cars were photographed at the Presidio with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background for Road & Track magazine and the 1963 issue of the Mercedes Benz magazine In Aller Welt and again in 1979. By the end of 1962, the organization had grown to just over 50, with some now coming from the rest of the United States and Canada. Many members were from Southern California and Oregon. By fall 1963, there were by-laws and members paid dues of $10.00. By 1965, a Southern California Chapter had been formed and the first meeting took place at the home of Stan Kauffman on August 11, 1965. Kauffman was President, James Mangham VP, and Tom Burniston was Secretary. Nineteen members of the Northern and Southern California Chapters met in Santa Barbara to plan for the first annual get together which was held in Reno, Nevada in May 1969. Membership had risen to nearly 200 and almost half attended the event when Chad Hunt became president. The organization began attracting members from all over the country and Hunt suggested that a formal Business Office be created. In 1971, membership had grown to 387. Roadster owners were accepted in 1971 though they could not vote. In 1972 Roadster owners were able to vote. In 2020, the GWG board voted on formally inviting Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG owners to become members. Inviting the SLS owners into the GWG exposes the 300 SL model to younger car enthusiasts. The SLS AMG is the spiritual successor to the 300 SL. The SLS AMG was designed to be a modern Gull Wing revival and 11473 cars were produced from 2010 to 2015. Many Gull Wing Group members who own a 300 SL also own an SLS. SLSs can now be shown and judged on the grass of the conventions. Roadsters are also welcomed in the Group ==Events== The first official event was a series of three technical sessions by a representative of the Robert Bosch Corporation covering the car‚Äôs fuel injection system. Regular social and driving events had already been initiated. President John Willott and fellow members, Craig Mcloughlin and Tom Thornhill organized a tour of Arizona driving 1000 miles in 2018. Rykodisc founder, Don Rose participated. In 2012, member, Garry Boyce, organized an international rally tour in New Zealand. Bob Sirna, a previous president of the organization set a new Bonneville Speedway F/GT speed record in 2016 in a 300 SL, establishing a new mark for 3L Sport cars of 190.759 mph. Amir Almagor, a board member of the group, organized the 2015 and 2018 Holyland1000 tour in Israel. Eight Roadsters and two Gullwings participated in March 2018 in a 1000 mile tour of 77 pre-1965 cars around Israel. The organization has an international membership of approximately 600 members from 25 countries. As of 2019, Southern California is the largest region with 150 active members. Membership is open to anyone. An annual convention is held each fall at a different location throughout the United States and Canada. The Gull Wing Group members attend events around the country every year including the Copperstate 1000 and the Colorado Grand. ==Group's publication== Spitzer typed up a (nearly) monthly bulletin, the precursor to the Group's 300StarLetter. The first Bulletin was a simple four-page mimeographed edition produced in January 1962. The cover topic for the June 1962 issue was the First Anniversary Dinner, which was coming up later that month at the San Francisco Airport Hilton. The tab of $5.00 per person for the evening included a cocktail hour and dinner and a small amount that would be retained for club expenses. The award-winning 300StarLetter is now published ten times a year.. The Group's roster has been a valuable vehicle ownership source and maintains an active directory that is used to show the provenance of cars sold at auction.. ==Benefits== Today the club has a parts store open only to the members, technical assistance from its technical committee, an annual convention held in a different part of the country each year, a 300 SL rally sponsored by the 300 SL Charitable Foundation formed with the support of the club in 2018 and the 300StarLetter club magazine. ==Conventions== There have been 51 annual Conventions. The 2019 annual convention was held in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The 2018 convention was held in Pasadena, California and past conventions were held in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Saratoga Springs, New York; Dearborn, Michigan; Las Vegas, Nevada; Newport, Rhode Island; Nashville, Tennessee; Victoria.

Born in London, Johnson worked various jobs, including a period as an actor. He trained as a scientific instrument maker, then became a schoolteacher in Norwich in about 1900, focusing on teaching practical skills. He joined the National Union of Teachers, soon becoming president of its Norfolk association, and also served as president of the Norwich Class Teachers' Association. Around 1905, he joined the ILP and, through it, the Labour Party; by the mid-1920s, he was president of the Norwich ILP, and secretary of the Norwich Labour Party. Later in the decade, he became the chairman of the ILP's Eastern Division. At the 1922 United Kingdom general election, Johnson stood for the Labour Party in Norwich. He took 15.7% and fourth place in the two- seat constituency. He next contested Great Yarmouth at the 1929 United Kingdom general election, taking third place with 17.8% of the vote. The ILP split from the Labour Party in 1932, and the East Anglian Division of the ILP became a stronghold of the Revolutionary Policy Committee, which advocated that the ILP should instead join the Communist Party of Great Britain. Johnson opposed this approach, instead working with John Middleton Murry on a manifesto which proposed an independent trajectory for the party. They ultimately triumphed, and from 1934, Johnson served as the division's representative on the party's National Administrative Council (NAC). He was also elected to Norwich City Council, on which he worked closely with the Labour Party, and by the end of the decade, he advocated the ILP reaffiliating to the Labour Party. Johnson was made an alderman on the city council in 1939, and was selected by the ILP as its Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Norwich at the next election, although due to World War II, this was not held until 1945, by which time the party had decided not to stand in the seat. He stood down from the NAC in 1945, but remained active in the party until his death in 1958. ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Independent Labour Party councillors Category:Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Councillors in Norfolk Category:Politicians from London ","title":"George Johnson (UK politician)"},{"id":"60361094","text":"Le Vignon-en-Quercy is a commune in the Lot department in south-western France.

The team ceased their Truck and ARCA operations during the 2019 season when Finley decided he wanted to focus on competing in the American Ethanol Late Model Tour. However, they re-opened the ARCA side of the team in 2020 with the team's crew chief, Bruce Cook, taking over most of the ownership of it from Finley. ==History== Driver Chad Finley formed a part-time team in the ARCA Racing Series in 2016, where he would be the driver. it was his first season in the series since 2010, when he drove part-time for K-Automotive Motorsports. In the team's debut race at Michigan, they fielded the No. 51 Chevrolet, where they would start and finish thirteenth. Their next start came at IRP, and Finley had a strong fifth place finish. He attempted one more race that year at Chicagoland, where Finley qualified fourth but did not finish the race, ending up in 23rd. The team returned in 2017, and in their first start of the season, which came at Nashville, Finley pulled off an upset win. On June 20, 2018, it was announced that Chad Finley would enter the summer Gateway race fielding is self-owned No. 42 Chevrolet. He started 20th and came home with an impressive 6th place finish.

Atlanta the following week. Texas. On December 5, 2018, it was announced that the No. 42 would run full time in the 2019 season. Chad Finley, Robby Lyons, and other drivers were to split the ride throughout the season. The team qualified 20th in the season-opener at Daytona with Robby Lyons behind the wheel, but would fall victim to an accident on lap 2, effectively ending their night. After the 30th place finish at Daytona, Chad Finley took the reigns at Atlanta, where he started 30th before being involved in another accident, leaving them with a 28th place result. After the conclusion of this event, the team's hauler entered the incorrect and shorter tunnel when exiting the track (on the way back to the shop), sustaining severe damage to both the hauler and the race trucks inside. This forced the team to withdraw from both the spring Las Vegas, and Martinsville races. CFR returned in Texas, with Garrett Smithley driving the No. 42 this time, making his first start with the team. Smithley rolled off from the 25th position, before driving up through the field to finish a solid 15th place. Finley then took the wheel, starting and finishing in the 18th position at Charlotte. At Kentucky, Finley qualified in the 12th spot, and looked to have a good run going, before getting loose and backing into the turn 3 wall, effectively placing them in the 26th position. On November 21, 2019, Finley announced the team's Truck Series assets had been sold in order to focus on racing in the American Ethanol Late Model Tour. On January 30, 2020, it was announced that the team would be returning and debuting in the ARCA Menards Series East (formerly the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series East), fielding the No. 42 Toyota part-time for Parker Retzlaff starting at Five Flags. With Finley focusing on running late models, the team's crew chief, Bruce Cook, took over most of the ownership of the stock-car team, and it was renamed Cook-Finley Racing.

The basic colour of the shell is creme-white with some brown colour bands. Like other representatives of the Genus Helicopsis it has four dart sacks, but only two of them contain love darts. The outer shape of the penis resembles a club or ball, the penis itself is very variable in morphology, with partly open penial walls that are occasionally fused with the penis sheath This led to various arrangements of lacunae around the seminal duct. Similar species are H. striata and H. hungarica. The latter one can be unambiguously separated from H. austriaca, as it has bigger shell dimensions. However small shells of H. striata can be confused with those of unkeeled specimens of H. austriaca. In this case a dissection ist required, as the internal genital characters of H. austriaca and H. striata are unique for each species. ==Taxonomy== H. austriaca was originally described as a new species of Helicopsis, but became later on a subspecies of H. striata. A recent comprehensive survey showed, that both H. austriaca and H. hungarica are no subspecies of H. striata, but separate species.Helicopsis austriaca on WoRMS Helicopsis hungarica on WoRMS ==Habitat and protection== H. austriaca inhabits two different types of habitat, which represent both primary natural steppe: * Former river banks in southern parts of the Vienna basin, characterized by dolomite gravel, where it was described first. * Boulder fields in the eastern margins of the Northern Calcareous Alps, within natural Austrian pine forests.

The film features Aretha Franklin recording her 1972 live album of the same name. It co-stars: James Cleveland, C. L. Franklin, Bernard Purdie, Chuck Rainey, Clara Ward, with cameos by Mick Jagger, Sydney Pollack, and Charlie Watts. The film was produced by Joe Boyd, Franklin, Elliott, Rob Johnson, Sabrina V. Owens, Angie Seegers, Tirrell D. Whittley, and Joseph Woolf under the banner of Al's Records And Tapes, in association with Time, 40 Acres and a Mule, Rampant, and Sundial Pictures. Amazing Grace film was not released on schedule in 1972 due to difficulty in synchronizing the audio tracks with the visual print and was relegated to a Warner Bros. vault until 2007, when producer Alan Elliott purchased the raw footage and attempted to synchronize it. The pared-down footage, now 87 minutes in length, was planned for a 2011 release. Franklin sued Elliott for appropriating her likeness without permission, however, and the release date passed. Elliott made another attempt in 2015 to hold the film's premiere at the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the Chicago International Film Festival, but Franklin sued him again for unpublished reasons. After Franklin's death in 2018, her family made an arrangement to release the film, which premiered at the Doc NYC in 2018, before being released worldwide on 5 April 2019. The film has received critical acclaim. ==Synopsis== American singer-songwriter Aretha Franklin records her gospel album Amazing Grace live at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles in 1972. She is accompanied by the Southern California Community Choir, directed by Alexander Hamilton, seated behind her as Franklin sings from the church's lectern to a mostly African-American audience. James Cleveland appears as a featured singer and a piano accompanist. Franklin is also accompanied by Bernard Purdie on drums and Chuck Rainey on bass guitar. On the second night Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts were in the audience while they were in L.A. finishing their album Exile on Main St. Critic Jordan Hoffman believes the gospel inflections of songs such as \\"Shine a Light\\" and \\"Let It Loose\\" were inspired by this visit. == Cast == Credits adapted from Rotten Tomatoes. *Aretha Franklin *James Cleveland *C. L. Franklin *Bernard Purdie *Chuck Rainey *Clara Ward *Mick Jagger *Sydney Pollack *Charlie Watts *Alexander Hamilton ==Production== In 1972, Joe Boyd, the Music Services director at Warner Bros., originally proposed that film director James Signorelli direct the film. At a later date, Warner CEO Ted Ashley approached Sydney Pollack to direct the film. Pollack accepted the assignment when he heard Franklin's name. Principal photography took place over a period of two nights at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, while Franklin recorded her Amazing Grace album live in 1972. The album went on to become the highest-selling gospel music album of all time. Pollack shot 20 hours of raw footage using 16 mm cameras. The post-production and supervision of the film were completed by Final Cut USA, Inc. Since Pollack had not used clapperboards, it turned out to be impossible to sync the audio with the video in post-production. The project was halted, and the raw footage placed in a vault at Warner Bros; it went unseen through the 1990s. ==Release== Franklin in 1968 The Amazing Grace film was initially scheduled for a 1972 release together with Warner Bros.' Super Fly. In 2007, producer Alan Elliott purchased the raw footage. Subsequently, sound editor/mixer Serge Perron successfully synchronized the sound with all the film footage. Once all the sound and footage were synchronized, Jeff Buchanan edited the film. Now pared down to 87 minutes, the film was scheduled for a 2011 release. However, Franklin sued Elliott for appropriating her likeness without permission, and the release was postponed. After Franklin's original release contract was discovered at the Warner Bros. offices, Elliott decided to release the film at the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the Chicago International Film Festival in 2015. Franklin sued him again, this time for unpublished reasons, and was granted an emergency injunction against the film screening, because she had not given permission to screen the footage.

Odie Henderson of RogerEbert.com enthused, \\"Whether you're religious or not, you owe it to yourself to see this movie if the chance arises. You'll see how much love and feeling went into the construction of the resulting album.\\" Varietys Owen Gleiberman noted, \\"The movie reveals how the fundamental distinction between \\"rock 'n' roll\\" and \\"rhythm and blues\\" was not only racist at its core, but a way for the consumer culture to slice the God out of music that was invented as a way to talk to God.\\" Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian wrote, \\"The film is almost wall-to-wall music, with Franklin barely acknowledging the audience between songs.\\" The Los Angeles Times Justin Chang wrote: \\"Aretha Franklin didn't transcend the gospel or gospel music; as first her album and now this marvelous documentary remind us, she did more than most to fulfill its potential for truth and beauty, devotion and art.\\" Hoffman wrote, \\"And we can quibble as to whether Pollack, Elliot or credited editor Jeff Buchanan is the true author of the piece.\\" Producer Chiemi Karasawa claimed her work on the film was not compensated and filed an arbitration case against Alan Elliott upon its release. Armond White of National Review criticized the film's politics, writing: \\"Is playing into the approval of white people the only way that bourgeois black people can think to confirm their significance? To reduce Franklin's art to the propaganda of 'empowerment' and activism disrespects the daily significance of the civil-rights movement and its basis in the sanctified church.\\" ===Accolades=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" + !Award !Year !Category !Result !. - ! scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\" AARP Movie Awards  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2019 Best Documentary   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - !scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"Black Reel Awards Outstanding Documentary  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\" Christian Science Monitor 2018 Top Ten Best Films of 2018   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Documentary Feature  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2019 Best Archival Documentary  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  - Best Music Documentary  - !scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"Central Ohio Film Critics Association 2020 Best Documentary  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"Detroit Film Critics Society  rowspan=\\"5\\" 2019 Best Documentary  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"Dublin Film Critics' Circle Best Documentary  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"National Society of Film Critics Awards Best Non-Fiction Film  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"NAACP Image Awards Outstanding Documentary  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"Rotten Tomatoes Top 100 Movies Of 2019  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" } ==References(UK) * * Category:2018 films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about singers Category:Films directed by Sydney Pollack Category:Aretha Franklin Category:2018 documentary films Category:Documentary films about African Americans Category:Neon (distributor) films Category:Concert films Category:American films ","title":"Amazing Grace (2018 film)"},{"id":"60361325","text":"George Lenon was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s and 1960s.

She played a prominent role in India's freedom movement in the 1920s‚Äì30s as an advocate of civil disobedience against the British Raj and its salt laws, and encouraged women to make salt. Born into a Kashmiri Brahmin family, Swarup Rani came from Lahore, British India, and married Motilal Nehru after his first wife and child died in childbirth. They had three children; Jawaharlal Nehru, Vijayalakshmi and Krishna. During the First World War, Swarup Rani helped knit and gather woollen clothing for soldiers, along with groups of European and Indian ladies. Until 1920, Swarup Rani resided in relative luxury. She lived with an extended family in a large house then known as Anand Bhavan, in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. In 1920, with Gandhi as the leader of Indian National Congress and with his twofold strategy of non-cooperation with the British and a fight against Indian \\"social evils\\" starting with untouchability, the ethos and functioning of the her household transformed. Both her husband and son gave up their legal practices and she joined the Nehru women in stricter self- discipline and the civil disobedience movement. In the 1930s, she became active in advocating for women to make salt in breach of British salt laws and experienced being beaten and injured in a lathi charge during a demonstration. Swarup Rani died in 1938. The Swarup Rani Nehru Hospital in Allahabad is named in her honour. She was the mother of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, who became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly, grandmother of India's only woman prime minister Indira Gandhi, and great grandmother of Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are her great great grandchildren. ==Early life== Swarup Rani (first on left) with Motilal (standing) and their children in England Swarup Rani Nehru was born in 1868 and came from Lahore, British India. Her family were of Kashmiri Brahmin origin. Her eyes were hazel in colour and her hair was chestnut brown. She herself understood English, but did not speak it. She was the second wife of Motilal Nehru, who had previously married as a teenager, as was tradition at the time. Both his first wife and their son died in childbirth. Soon after Swarup Rani and Motilal married, they had a son who died in infancy. One legend recounts that they were informed by a yogi that they would never have a son, and ten months after the yogi's death, on 14 November 1889, a boy, Jawaharlal Nehru was born.Tharoor, Shashi Nehru (2003). Chapter 1. \\"With Little to Commend Me: 1889‚Äì1912. p.1-9 A few years into their marriage however, Swarup Rani's health deteriorated.Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.24-25 For the rest of her life, during recurrent relapses of illness, her elder sister Rajvati took care of her.Nanda, B. R. Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.42 Family life before 1920 took place in the mansion then known as Anand Bhavan, Allahabad, in an affluent neighbourhood with mainly British neighbours. The household consisted of an extended family. There was electricity and running water, and the compound included stables, a swimming pool and a tennis court. Many of Swarup Rani's husband's suits were tailored in Saville Row, her son's toys came from England, and the family was the first in Allahabad to own a car. On 18 August 1900, Swarup Rani gave birth to a daughter, Sarup Kumari, better known as Vijayalakshmi Pandit. On 5 May 1905, Swarup Rani left Bombay and travelled to London with her husband, son and eldest daughter. Motilal's intentions were to place Jawaharlal in a good school, and also, as he noted to his nephew Brij Lal Nehru, who was in Oxford at the time, to \\"consult some specialists about the proper treatment and the most suitable watering place for [my] wife\\".Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.69 Following a tour of Europe, and a farewell to Jawaharlal at Harrow School, they arrived back in Allahabad in November 1905. In the same month, and coincidentally on Jawaharlal's birthday, Swarup Rani gave birth to a third son, who they named Ratan Lal.Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.76 However, this son died in infancy. On 2 November 1907, Swarup Rani's second daughter and last child, Krishna, was born. Swarup Rani's daughters' names were anglicized from 'Nanhi' and 'Beti', to 'Nan' and 'Betty' by their English governesses, and Jawaharlal was tutored in English poetry. Swarup Rani however, was a key influence on him. An early family portrait has Victorian-looking style, and Jawaharlal sits in a sailor suit, however, Swarup Rani and the other Nehru women in the household exerted a traditional Hindu influence on him. Despite becoming increasingly unwell herself, Swarup Rani went to much effort to keep at bay 'the evil eye' from those who were envious or who excessively admired her only surviving son, by applying a black dot on his forehead. During the First World War, Swarup Rani helped knit and gather woollen clothing for soldiers, along with groups of European and Indian ladies.Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.126 Sometime before 1916, Swarup Rani received a letter from her son Jawaharlal, suggesting that he preferred not to have an arranged marriage, and might choose to stay a bachelor. However, Swarup Rani had consulted a trusted pandit, and after having their horoscopes compared, Jawaharlal Nehru and Kamala Kaul were married on 8 February 1916.Tharoor, Shashi Nehru (2003). Chapter 2. Greatest is being thrust upon me: 1912‚Äì1921. p.21-22 A swami once recounted that Swarup Rani was \\"a devout, traditional Hindu whose one regret was that Jawaharlal and Kamala had no living son\\". On the night of 19 November 1917, Swarup announced \\"Hua\\". Unable to say \\"female\\", she simply announced that it has happened: a grandchild (later known as Indira Gandhi) had been born while her husband was drinking Haig. She had wanted a grandson.Kalhan, Promilla Kamala Nehru (1973) p.14 Later, Indira would refer to her grandmother as \\"Dol Amma\\", the grandmother who would give her sweets from the \\"doli\\", the food cupboard. ==Later life== Nehru-Gandhi family group photo, Sawrup Rani Nehru seated first left In 1920, with Gandhi as the leader of the Indian National Congress and with his two-fold strategy of non-cooperation with the British and a fight against Indian \\"social evils\\" starting with untouchability, the ethos and functioning of the Nehru family household transformed. Both Jawaharlal and Motilal gave up their legal practices.Nehru and Sahgal, Before Freedom. p.25-30 The resulting financial difficulties also led to the sale of the Nehru women's jewellery, including Swarup Rani's.Kalhan, Promilla Kamala Nehru (1973) p.28 Their daughter Krishna was taken out from school, the twice daily meals merged into one, and stables, staff, the fineries of life including crockery and crystal were reduced. The women subsequently adapted to a house frequently visited by Congress men.Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.184-191 On 7 December 1921, shortly after the Viceroy gave instructions to the Secretary of State to arrest and prosecute \\"any person, however prominent\\" ... considered necessary \\"for maintenance of law and respect of authority\\", Motilal and Jawaharlal were arrested and taken to prison. At an interview with Swarup Rani, she \\"rejoiced in the great privilege of sending my dear husband and my only son to jail\\" and she added that \\"Mahatma Gandhi told me once that others in the world have also their only sons\\".Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.195-196 On 26 January 1922, with the aim to recruit women to the Indian Congress party, Swarup Rani presided over a meeting in Idgah where 1000 people attended. Swarup Rani's granddaughter Nayantara Sahgal, later described how Swarup Rani \\"had in her widowhood taken a soldier's part in the national movement\\".Nehru and Sahgal, Before Freedom. p.197-198 In 1930, with the launch of the civil disobedience movement and Gandhi's salt march, Motilal gave Anand Bhavan to the Indian Congress Party. In the same year, Swarup Rani, in favour of the movement against the British Raj and its salt laws, endorsed the self manufacturing of salt. She appealed to women to enlist themselves into co-operating for self-rule: \\"if you are true to your motherland then you should start manufacturing salt in every household\\". When Motilal died on 6 February 1931,Nehru and Sahgal, Before Freedom. p.87-88 Swarup Rani was at his bedside.Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962). p.338 In 1932, on a visit to Calcutta for Kamala's treatment, Swarup Rani expressed concern over Kamala's strict adherence to self-discipline and refraining from all forms of luxuries, wishing for her to wear at least a \\"necklace and a pair of bangles\\".Kalhan, Promilla Kamala Nehru (1973) p.88-92 During another incident, a day after visiting her son in prison, Swarup Rani was found by a swami to be sitting in a room in the sweltering heat and without the fan switched on. The swami reported \\"the mother's heart was touched, and henceforth she refused to enjoy the comfort of an electric fan while her son rotted in the hot prison cell\\". In the same year, she was beaten and injured in a lathi charge during a demonstration. She wrote to her son \\"the mother of a brave son is also somewhat like him\\".Tharoor, Shashi Nehru (2003). Chapter 5. \\"In Office but not in Power\\": 1931‚Äì1937. p.90 In his autobiography, Jawaharlal Nehru writes: \\"Though my admiration and affection for him (his father) remained as strong as ever, fear formed part of them. Not so with my mother. I had no fear of her, for I knew that she would condone everything I did, and because of her excessive and indiscriminating love for me, I tried to dominate over her a little. I saw much more of her than I did of father.\\" ==Death and legacy== She died on 10 January 1938,Tharoor, Shashi Nehru (2003). Chapter 6. \\"In the Name of God, Go!\\": 1937‚Äì1945. p.112 with her sister, son Nehru and daughters Sarup and Betty beside her. Her sister died the following day. As well as the wife of Indian National Congress leader Motilal Nehru and mother of India's first prime minister Pandit Nehru, Swarup Rani was the mother of Vijayalakshmi Pandit who became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly, grandmother of India's only ever woman prime minister Indira Gandhi and great grandmother of Rajiv Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are her great great grandchildren.

The name originates from Spanish asado (\\"grilled\\"), a reference to the original dish it was applied to, the Chinese-Filipino version of char siu barbecues usually known as pork asado. However, the Filipino versions have evolved to be braised, not grilled. The other Filipino dish also known as asado is asado de carajay. Unlike the Chinese-derived version, it is savory rather than sweet. ==Variations== ===Asado de carajay=== Asado de carajay is a native asado. The name is derived from Philippine Spanish carajay (\\"wok\\" , kawali or kalaha in Philippine languages). Asado de carajay is made with meat (pork, beef, or chicken) braised in soy sauce, bay leaves, peppercorns, calamansi, onions, and various vegetables (usually tomatoes, potatoes, mushrooms, and carrots). It is traditionally cooked in a wok, hence the name. Asado de carajay is differentiated from the \\"Chinese-style\\" pork asado in the use of vegetables, the absence of Chinese spices, and its savory flavor. It is also not restricted to pork, but can be cooked with beef or chicken. ===Pork asado=== Pork asado buns Pork asado, also known as \\"Chinese\\" asado or \\"Chinese-style\\" asado, is the variant most commonly associated with the name asado. It is derived from the Chinese dish char siu, and possibly also influenced by the Hokkien dish tau yew bak. Unlike char siu however, the dish is always braised, not grilled or roasted. The dish is made with pork braised in soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, onion, brown sugar, and various Chinese spices (usually star anise and five spice). It is very similar to humba and pata tim, which also originate from Chinese-Filipino migrants. It also resembles hamonado, because of its sweetness, though hamonado uses pineapples and is a native dish. Pork asado is usually sliced thinly and served with the braising liquid. Pork asado is also commonly shredded and used as fillings for sandwiches and buns. It is also the primary filling of the Filipino siopao, which is also known as siopao asado. A variant of pork asado is the \\"Macau-style\\" pork asado. It uses the same ingredients but differs primarily in that the meat isn't broiled beforehand, but rather it is boiled directly in the marinade until tender. ==See also== *Humba *Pata tim *Cuisine of the Philippines * List of Philippine dishes ==References== ==External links== Category:Philippine pork dishes ","title":"Philippine asado"},{"id":"60361432","text":"Reiner Schilling (10 May 1943 - 15 October 2013) was a German wrestler.

In 1933 Parish was a founding member and officer of the Fine Arts Guild, a group that held exhibitions of members' works at Grant Studios and other galleries. Reviewing this show, the critic, Howard Devree, singled out a painting of hers called \\"Black Tower,\\" calling it \\"grimly impressive.\\" After appearing in group shows later in 1933 and early in 1934, Parish was given a solo exhibition in a gallery at the Eighth Street Playhouse. During the remainder of the 1930s Parish continued to exhibit exhibited etchings, woodblocks, and watercolors in the Washington Square outdoor exhibits and Fine Arts Guild. Her work also appeared in group shows at places such as the Corcoran Gallery and the galleries of the Municipal Art Committee. She also joined and began appearing in annual exhibitions of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. In 1939 she was awarded a prize in the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors fiftieth anniversary exhibition. An image of the prize-winning painting, a landscape called \\"The Lower Lot,\\" appeared with the New York Times article describing the show. During the late 1930s she made prints as an employee of the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration. She continued to show in group exhibitions during the 1940s, mostly those of the women's association, by then renamed the National Association of Women Artists. She showed a panoramic painting called \\"Washington Square South\\" in the 1942 show, which was, without explanation, called the 50th anniversary exhibition. In the mid-1940s she joined the Pen and Brush Club and began to show in its group exhibitions. In 1944 the club awarded her first prize in the oil paintings category and in 1947 gave her an honorable mention. In 1941, 1942, and 1943 she exhibited with the American Society of Etchers and in 1943 was awarded a prize for work by a non-member. In the early 1950s she won further recognition from the New York Society of Women Artists and the Pen and Brush Club. In the late 1950s and the 1960s her work appeared in retrospective solo exhibitions in places such as the Utica Public Library and the Rural Supplementary Education Center in Stamford, New York. She was given posthumous solo exhibitions at the Sylvan Cole Gallery (1988) and the Susan Teller Gallery (1988) as well as one group (2005) and one duo exhibition (2009) at the Teller Gallery. ===Artistic style and critical reception=== Betty Waldo Parish, Thompson Memorial, Vassar College, 1932, wood engraving, 10 x 7 inches Betty Waldo Parish, Country Barn, lithograph in colors, about 1936, 12 1/4 x 16 3/4 inches Vineyard Haven (Martha's Vineyard), 1945, wood engraving, 9 x 15 inches Betty Waldo Parish, Four Figures, 1950, wood engraving printed in black and sepia, 10 x 15 inches Parish was a skillful printmaker and painter who worked in a modernist representational style on subjects that were predominantly landscapes, cityscapes, figures, and still lifes. \\"Thompson Memorial, Vassar College,\\" shown at left, illustrates her handling of a landscape in woodblock early in her career. \\"Country Barn,\\" shown at right, illustrates her handling of color lithography at about the same time. \\"Vinyard Haven (Martha's Vinyard),\\" shown at left, illustrates her handling of a seascape in woodblock late in her career. \\"Four Figures,\\" shown at right, illustrates her handling of figures in woodblock late in her career. Critics in general singled out her work as being exceptional and worthy of attention but did not discuss its style, technique, or other artistic attributes. Howard Devree, the only critic with a major New York newspaper to discuss her work in any detail, limited himself to generalizations. Along with other artists in a group show, he said in 1933 that her work was free from \\"freakishness and imitation\\" and (as already noted) later that year called one of her paintings \\"grimly impressive.\\" In 1940 he said a painting called \\"Priston Road\\" was \\"forceful\\" and in 1941 he praised one of her prints for its \\"meticulous detail.\\" In 1933 a critic for the New York Sun named Parish as one of a group whose works \\"edged to the fore\\" and accomplished \\"more or less engagingly what the artist set out to do.\\" In 1940 a critic for an out-of-town paper called her work outstanding and said of one: \\"It is a fine example of modern treatment of landscape, exhibiting a fine sense of design with excellent color.\\" The critic added, \\"Miss Parish's work is fresh, and her approach to her subject is modern.\\" ==Personal life and family== Betty Waldo Parish was born in Cologne in 1910. Although she used Betty as her forename and sources of 1925 or later give that name, public records show her name as Elizabeth before that date. Her father was William Francis Parish (1874-1939), an engineer who specialized in machine lubricants and who was known for his work in military aviation and in developing synthetic oils. He was a U.S. citizen traveling in Germany when Betty Waldo Parish was born. Her mother was Josephine Driggs Parish (born about 1882). The two were married in Boston in 1904. Betty Waldo Parish had a sister, Helen K. Parish (born about 1913) and a brother William W. Parish (born about 1922). In 1930 she married Edward Stanhope Leonard (born about 1902), an illustrator. In 1935 that marriage ended in divorce and in 1938 she married Whitney Darrow Jr. (1909-1999), a New Yorker cartoonist. In 1942, after divorcing Darrow, she married Richard Comyn Eames, a farm equipment specialist and breeder of collies, ponies, and horses. Eames and Parish had two children, Richard Comyn Eames II (1945-1997), a sculptor whose professional name was Dickon Eames, and Elizabeth Parish Eames Roebling (born 1947), a journalist with the Inter Press Service. Sometime after the birth of the two children, Richard Comyn Eames moved to St. Croix, Virgin Islands, while Parish remained in New York. He did not attend the weddings of either child, both held in 1967. Parish died in 1986. == Notes == ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1986 deaths Category:American printmakers Category:Artists from New York City Category:20th-century American painters Category:American women painters Category:The New School alumni Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni Category:Grand Central School of Art alumni Category:Alumni of the Acad√©mie Julian Category:Federal Art Project artists ","title":"Betty Waldo Parish"},{"id":"60361551","text":"Hans Sverre Sj√∏vold (born 20 August 1957) is a Norwegian police chief and civil servant.

He was ordained by the Fairfax Baptist Church in Fairfax, Maine (subsequently re-named Albion, Maine). 1816: Asa McGray and his family arrived in Windsor, Nova Scotia, Canada. They settled in Cornwallis, where he worked at his trade as a wheelwright. ‚ÄúWhenever the opportunity presented itself, he preached, becoming the first Free Will Baptist preacher in Nova Scotia.\\" 1821: Asa McGray and his family settled in Cape Sable Island, Shelburne County, Nova Scotia. There, he established a church of 19 members, which was the first church of Free Will Baptists in Nova Scotia. 1826: Asa McGray helped organize the Free Will Baptist Church in Greene, Maine. In addition, he helped form other churches in Nova Scotia's Shelburne, Yarmouth, Kings, and Queens counties. He continued preaching at Cape Sable Island until his death in 1843. Cape Sable Island was his parish. \\"He preached without salary, working his land and taking freewill offerings for his support.\\" He was a promoter for the public good, including developing agriculture, expanding the local economy, and help build a bridge to cross an island creek. In addition, in 1831 he was a leader of Cape Sable Island's branch of the Total Abstinence Society, which was a provincial temperance movement. At the time, that society numbered 71 male and 96 female members. Rev. McGray died 30 December 1843. While the Shelburne County Genealogical Society and Free Will Baptist Church records give Asa's death date as 30 December, his gravestone indicates 28 December 1843. He is buried behind to his church in Centreville, Cape Sable Island. His funeral was conducted by Rev. Edward Reynolds, preaching from 2 Samuel, \\"Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel.\\" A drawing of Rev. McGray was made in black crayon in the 1830s by a fellow minister from Maine. About 1876, the artist Jacob Blauvelt of Tusket painted an oil on canvas portrait from the old crayon drawing.

The Logan family was an old family in Scotland, dating back to 1200 in Wigtownshire, Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, and Edinburghshire. ==Life and career== James Logan was born in Glasgow, Scotland on May 6, 1852. He was three months old when his family came to the United States. As a child, he worked in Parkhurst Woolen Mill at Valley Falls. When he was twelve, his arm was caught in a machine and broke in three places. His arm never recovered to full strength and usefulness, and now handicapped as a mill operative, he was forced to seek other employment. In 1907, Logan was elected mayor of Worcester, his total vote being larger than any other candidate previously who hadn't run uncontested.

These methods can be used to study fish, as genetic material, in the form of environmental DNA (eDNA) or cells, is freely diffused in the water. This allows researchers to identify which species are present in a body of water by collecting a water sample, extracting DNA from the sample and isolating DNA sequences that are specific for the species of interest. Barcoding methods can also be used for biomonitoring and food safety validation, animal diet assessment, assessment of food webs and species distribution, and for detection of invasive species. In fish research, barcoding can be used as an alternative to traditional sampling methods. Barcoding methods can often provide information without damage to the studied animal. Aquatic environments have unique properties that affect how genetic material from organisms is distributed. DNA material diffuses rapidly in aquatic environments, which makes it possible to detect organisms from a large area when sampling a specific spot. Due to rapid degradation of DNA in aquatic environments, detected species represent contemporary presence, without confounding signals from the past. DNA-based identification is fast, reliable and accurate in its characterization across life stages and species. Reference libraries are used to connect barcode sequences to single species and can be used to identify the species present in DNA samples. Libraries of reference sequences are also useful in identifying species in cases of morphological ambiguity, such as with larval stages. eDNA samples and barcoding methods are used in water management, as species composition can be used as an indicator of ecosystem health. Barcoding and metabarcoding methods are particularly useful in studying endangered or elusive fish, as species can be detected without catching or harming the animals. == Applications == === Ecological monitoring === Biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems is required by national and international legislation (e.g. the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive). Traditional methods are time-consuming and include destructive practices that can harm individuals of rare or protected species. DNA barcoding is a relatively cost-effective and quick method for identifying fish species aquatic environments. Presence or absence of key fish species can be established using eDNA from water samples and spatio-temporal distribution of fish species (e.g. timing and location of spawning) can be studied. This can help discover e.g. impacts of physical barriers such as dam construction and other human disturbances. DNA tools are also used in dietary studies of fish and the construction of aquatic food webs. Metabarcoding of fish gut contents or feces identify recently consumed prey species. However, secondary predation must be taken into consideration. ===Invasive species=== Early detection is vital for control and removal of non-indigenous, ecologically harmful species (e.g. lion fish (Pteroissp.) in the Atlantic and Caribbean). Metabarcoding of eDNA can be used to detect cryptic or invasive species in aquatic ecosystems. ===Fisheries management=== Barcoding and metabarcoding approaches yield rigorous and extensive data on recruitment, ecology and geographic ranges of fisheries resources. The methods also improve knowledge of nursery areas and spawning grounds, with benefits for fisheries management. Traditional methods for fishery assessment can be highly destructive, such as gillnet sampling or trawling. Molecular methods offers an alternative for non-invasive sampling. For example, barcoding and metabarcoding can help identifying fish eggs to species to ensure reliable data for stock assessment, as it has proven more reliable than identification via phenotypic characters. Barcoding and metabarcoding are also powerful tools in monitoring of fisheries quotas and by-catch. eDNA can detect and quantify the abundance of some anadromous species as well as their temporal distribution. This approach can be used to develop appropriate management measures, of particular importance for commercial fisheries. ===Food safety=== Globalisation of food supply chains has led to an increased uncertainty of the origin and safety of fish-based products. Barcoding can be used to validate the labelling of products and to trace their origin. ‚ÄúFish fraud‚Äù has been discovered across the globe. A recent study from supermarkets in the state of New York found that 26.92% of seafood purchases with an identifiable barcode were mislabelled. Barcoding can also trace fish species as there can be human health hazards related to consumption of fish. Further, biotoxins can occasionally be concentrated when toxins move up the food chain. One example relates to coral reef species where predatory fish such as barracuda have been detected to cause Ciguatera fish poisoning. Such new associations of fish poisoning can be detected by the use of fish barcoding. 364x364px ===Protection of endangered species=== Barcoding can be used in the conservation of endangered species through the prevention of illegal trading of CITES listed species. There is a large black market for fish based products and also in the aquarium and pet trades. To protect sharks from overexploitation, illegal use can be detected from barcoding shark fin soup and traditional medicines. == Methodology == === Sampling in aquatic environments === 426x426px Aquatic environments have special attributes that need to be considered when sampling for fish eDNA metabarcoding. Seawater sampling is of particular interest for assessment of health of marine ecosystems and their biodiversity. Although the dispersion of eDNA in seawater is large and salinity negatively influences DNA preservation, a water sample can contain high amounts of eDNA from fish up to one week after sampling. Free molecules, intestinal lining and skin cell debris are the main sources of fish eDNA. In comparison to marine environments, ponds have biological and chemical properties that can alter eDNA detection. The small size of ponds compared to other water bodies makes them more sensitive to environmental conditions such as exposure to UV light and changes in temperature and pH. These factors can affect the amount of eDNA. Moreover, trees and dense vegetation around ponds represent a barrier that prevents water aeration by wind. Such barriers can also promote the accumulation of chemical substances that damage eDNA integrity. Heterogeneous distribution of eDNA in ponds may affect detection of fishes. Availability of fish eDNA is also dependent of life stage, activity, seasonality and behavior. The largest amounts of eDNA are obtained from spawning, larval stages and breeding activity. === Target regions === Primer design is crucial for metabarcoding success. Some studies on primer development have described cytochrome B and 16S as suitable target regions for fish metabarcoding. Evans et.al. (2016) described that Ac16S and L2513/H2714 primer sets are able to detect fish species accurately in different mesocosms. Another study performed by Valentini et.al. (2016) showed that the L1848/H1913 primer pair, which amplifies a region of 12S rRNA locus, was able to reach high taxonomical coverage and discrimination even with a short target fragment. This research also evidenced that in 89% of sampling sites, metabarcoding approach was similar or even higher than traditional methods (e.g. electrofishing and netting methods). H√§nfling et.al. (2016) performed metabarcoding experiments focused on lake fish communities using 12S_F1/12S_R1 and CytB_L14841/CytB_H15149 primer pairs, whose targets were located in the mitochondrial 12S and cytochrome B regions respectively. The results demonstrate that detection of fish species was higher when using 12S primers than CytB. This was due to the persistence of shorter 12S fragments (~100 bp) in comparison to larger CytB amplicon (~460 bp). In general, these studies summarize that special considerations about primer design and selection have to be taken according to the objectives and nature of the experiment. == Fish reference databases == There are a number of open access databases available to researchers worldwide. The proper identification of fish specimens with DNA barcoding methods relies heavily on the quality and species coverage of available sequence databases. A fish reference database is an electronic database that typically contains DNA barcodes, images, and geospatial coordinates of examined fish specimens. The database can also contain linkages to voucher specimens, information on species distributions, nomenclature, authoritative taxonomic information, collateral natural history information and literature citations. Reference databases may be curated, meaning that the entries are subjected to expert assessment before being included, or uncurated, in which case they may include a large number of reference sequences but with less reliable identification of species. FISH-BOL Launched in 2005, The Fish Barcode of Life Initiative (FISH-BOL) www.fishbol.org is an international research collaboration that is assembling a standardized reference DNA sequence library for all fish species. It is a concerted global research project with the goal to collect and assemble standardized DNA barcode sequences and associated voucher provenance data in a curated reference sequence library to aid the molecular identification of all fish species. If researchers wish to contribute to the FISH-BOL reference library, clear guidelines are provided for specimen collection, imaging, preservation, and archival, as well as meta-data collection and submission protocols. The Fish-BOL database functions as a portal to the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD). French Polynesia Fish Barcoding Base The French Polynesia Fish Barcoding Database contains all the specimens captured during several field trips organised or participated in by CRIOBE (Centre for Island Research and Environmental Observatory) since 2006 in the Archipelagos of French Polynesia. For each classified specimen, the following information can be available: scientific name, picture, date, GPS coordinate, depth and method of capture, size, and Cytochrome Oxidase c Subunit 1 (CO1) DNA sequence. The database can be searched using name (genus or species) or using a part of the CO1 DNA sequence. Aquagene A collaborative product developed by several German institutions, Aquagene provides free access to curated genetic information of marine fish species. The database allows species identification by DNA sequence comparisons. All species are characterized by multiple gene sequences, presently including the standard CO1 barcoding gene together with CYTB, MYH6 and (coming shortly) RHOD, facilitating unambiguous species determination even for closely related species or those with high intraspecific diversity. The genetic data is complemented online with additional data of the sampled specimen, such as digital images, voucher number and geographic origin. Additional resources Other reference databases that are more general, but may also be useful for barcoding fish are the Barcode of Life Datasystem and Genbank. == Advantages == Barcoding/metabarcoding provides quick and usually reliable species identification, meaning that morphological identification, i.e. taxonomic expertise, is not needed. Metabarcoding also makes it possible to identify species when organisms are degraded or only part of an organism is available. It is a powerful tool for detection of rare and/or invasive species, which can be detected despite low abundance. Traditional methods to assess fish biodiversity, abundance and density include the use of gears like nets, electrofishing equipment, trawls, cages, fyke-nets or other gear which show reliable results of presence only for abundant species. Contrary, rare native species, as well as newly established alien species, are less likely to be detected via traditional methods, leading to incorrect absence/presence assumptions. Barcoding/metabarcoding is also in some cases a non-invasive sampling method, as it provides the opportunity to analyze DNA from eDNA or by sampling living organisms. For fish parasites, metabarcoding allows for detection of cryptic or microscopic parasites from aquatic environments, which is difficult with more direct methods (e.g. identifying species from samples with microscopy). Some parasites exhibit cryptic variation and metabarcoding can be helpful method in revealing this. The application of eDNA metabarcoding is cost-effective in large surveys or when many samples are required. eDNA can reduce the costs of fishing, transport of samples and time invested by taxonomists, and in most cases requires only small amounts of DNA from target species to reach reliable detection. Constantly decreasing prices for barcoding/metabarcoding due to technical development is another advantage. The eDNA approach is also suitable for monitoring of inaccessible environments. == Challenges == The results obtained from metabarcoding are limited or biased to the frequency of occurrence. It is also problematic that far from all species have barcodes attached to them. Even though metabarcoding may overcome some practical limitations of conventional sampling methods, there is still no consensus regarding experimental design and the bioinformatic criteria for application of eDNA metabarcoding. The lack of criteria is due to the heterogeneity of experiments and studies conducted so far, which dealt with different fish diversities and abundances, types of aquatic ecosystems, numbers of markers and marker specificities. Another significant challenge for the method is how to quantify fish abundance from molecular data. Although there are some cases in which quantification has been possible there appears to be no consensus on how, or to what extent, molecular data can meet this aim for fish monitoring. == See also == Detailed information on DNA barcoding of different organisms can be found here: DNA Barcoding DNA barcoding in diet assessment Algae DNA barcoding Microbial DNA barcoding Aquatic macroinvertebrate DNA barcoding == References == Category:Authentication methods Category:Bioinformatics Category:Biometrics Category:Molecular genetics Category:Taxonomy (biology) ","title":"Fish DNA barcoding"},{"id":"60361761","text":"Dromm is a surname.

It was designed by Landscape Architects Denise Mattes and Frank Varro. Located at the northeastern corner of Elmhurst Park, it was announced in June 2017. Although planning and fundraising started in the mid-2000s, construction began on November 29, 2018, with $2.3 million in funding from the Queens Borough Council. The memorial was dedicated on December 20, 2019. The Memorial is a slightly sunken elliptical space framed by two Barre Gray Granite walls. One wall contains the names of the 371 Queens residents who died in the Vietnam War, with their ages at their death. Under the names is a timeline of the war, describing some of the major events from May 7, 1954 to April 30, 1975. There is then a short statement honoring those veterans who have lost their lives after the war due to things ranging from PTSD to Agent Orange exposure side effects. It also honors Pat Toro, a veteran who advocated for the memorial but died prior to its construction. The opposite granite wall has a drawing of Bamboo etched in its surface, with a bench where visitors can sit and view the names and history. The outside face of the wall is engraved with the name of the memorial, a dedication to all Vietnam Veterans, an engraving of the Vietnam Service Medal, and of the Service Marks for the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard. The faces of the wall with the title and the names and history are lit, as is a flag pole. In the center of the elliptical space is a granite map showing the area around Vietnam, with several places mentioned in the historical text marked as well. The plantings around the memorial were selected to provide color throughout the year, with a focus on fall color of Green, Yellow and Red, the colors of the Vietnam Service Medal Ribbon, around Veterans Day.

He was the son of Gleb Vseslavich of Minsk (death 1119) and Anastasia, a daughter of Yaropolk Izyaslavich. Volodar died after 1167, possibly 1176. Volodar's family had long been in conflict with the Grand Prince of Kiev, Vladimir Monomach, who in 1113 (according to some information 1119) conquered Minsk from Volodar's father. Later, the remaining possessions of the Polish dynasty had been conquered by Vladimir's son Mstislav I of Kiev and its members were forced into exile to, inter alia, Constantinople. However, after Mstislav's death in 1132, the Kiev Empire slowly collapsed and the Polish dynasty could return to the Russian political scene. Volodar married June 5, 1135 (probably while in exile in Poland) with Richeza of Poland, Queen of Sweden, daughter of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth and widow of the Danish prince and short-lived king Magnus I of Sweden, who the year before fell in the Battle of Fotevik. Volodar and Rikissa got the daughter Sofia of Minsk, who later married Valdemar the Great of Denmark. The marriage of Volodar and Rikis was a political move by her father directed against the then alliance between Erik Emune of Denmark and the descendants of Monomach.

A neighborhood in Keetmanshoop, which he founded in 1866, is named after him. == Early life and education == Kr√∂nlein was one of 11 children of Vitus Kr√∂nlein (1772‚Äì1834), a tanner, and Karoline K√∂llner (1794‚Äì1864), daughter of the pastor Wilhelm M.E. K√∂llner, who had a great influence on his grandchildren's choice of profession. K√∂llner wanted to become a missionary himself but later demurred. Several of Johann's sister's married pastors and two of his brothers took the missionary calling as well. At first set to become a tradesman, Kr√∂nlein decided to become a missionary in November 1846. He trained at the Rhenish Missionary Institute in Barmen from 1846 to 1850. == In South West Africa == Kr√∂nlein came to the Cape as a Rhenish Missionary in April 1851. That August, he was appointed successor to Johannes Samuel Hahn as chief of the mission in Berseba, South West Africa, at the time the isolated outpost of captain Paul Goliath and his Oorlam tribe, whose living conditions one missionary described as \\"fit for dogs and cats.\\" There Kr√∂nlein would live for a quarter-century. Already a stellar language student during his missionary training, Kr√∂nlein set about learning Khoekhoe, the language of the Nama people upon arrival in SWA. His task was difficult at first but helped immensely by the arrival of the Baster leader Daniel Cloete, who taught him well. In 1857, he married Sophie Terlinden (1819‚Äì1898), sister of a pastor in Stellenbosch. They were childless. In 1857, he inaugurated the church he helped build, taking a sabbatical to Cape Town for his health where he soon began his translation work over long hours with the help of Khoekhoe speakers and the linguist Wilhelm Bleek. == Writing == In 1865, Kr√∂nlein left for Germany with his wife, manuscripts in tow. He produced three publications: Luther's Small Catechism (Berlin, 1866); the Calw edition of his Bible stories, «ÉNai-«ÉKeiti «Äneisa tsi«Äasa testamens diti (Berlin, 1866); and his New Testament translation, «ÉKhub tsi hui-aob Yesub Christub dis (Berlin, 1866, revised by his fellow Rhenish Missionary Hermann Kreft of Bethanie). He later translated the Old Testament into Khoekhoe as well, which was handed over to British and other foreign bible societies; the notes would only return to the Rhenish Missionary Society for formal publication in 1950. During another leave in 1871, he published a short hymnal; followed by a translation of the Psalms,Kanis Psalmti dis (Cape Town, 1872); and a liturgical book Agendes Luther-«Åei kerkib (Cape Town, 1872). His most notable linguistic achievement is his dictionary, Wortschatz der Khoi-khoin (Namaqua-Hottentotten) (Berlin, 1889), published with the help of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the German Colonial Society. This dictionary (with second editions published in the 1960s and 1970s) established the standard Khoekhoe orthography. Kr√∂nlein rendered click consonants under the Standard Alphabet by Lepsius, determining syllables by etymology and distinguishing three pitches (low, middle, and high). This improved on the spelling used by predecessors such as Heinrich Schmelen, Hans Christian Knudsen, and Henry Tindall. His work remains standard, though verb etymology remains nominal and speculative, and three clicks are not the only such sounds used. Later additions were made to the vocabulary as well. The book provides sentence examples for context and sample idioms as well. == Missionary work == As a missionary, he was a strong personality, and a hard, exemplary worker, striving to keep his congregation out of inter-tribal raids. He returned in 1867 from his visit as Germany to become superintendent of the RMS in Namaland, a post he held until 1877, when health problems and family circumstances led him to retire to home life in Stellenbosch. During these years, he familiarized himself with the Nama tribes and Basters. By negotiating with the Nama chief Cornelius «ÅOasib, Kr√∂nlein helped Kido Witbooi and his followers settle in Gibeon. During this period, he also founded Swartmodder (Keetmanshoop), on April 14, 1866. Swartmodder was named after a group of Oorlam he had served, Basters offered grazing lands by the Berseba Nama for two years (1868-1870). Kr√∂nlein presided over the RMS conference in Otjimbinwe in 1870, and participated several months later in the peace conference between the Herero and Nama that was held in Okahandja in September 1870. Along with Carl Hugo Hahn and others, Kr√∂nlein played a major role in forging the \\"true peace\\" known as the Treaty of Okahandja, which held through 1880. Kr√∂nlein's mission, Berseba, was a centrally located linchpin of the political controversies of the era, leading him to play a major role in them. When Cape Colony envoy W. Coates Palgrave visited in 1876, Kr√∂nlein negotiated potential Cape protectorate status for Namaland. A few years after his retirement, in 1882, he returned to SWA, trying in vain to reconcile the tribes that had returned to war in 1880. == Retirement == In Stellenbosch, Kr√∂nlein taught Khoekhoe to young Rhenish Missionaries and worked tirelessly on his Old Testament translation into the language, which he completed by the end of the 1880s. He struggled to find peer review for publication, however, since colleagues were shunted to the war between the German government and Hendrik Witbooi until its conclusion in 1894. Therefore, Kr√∂nlein never lived to see his labor of love in print. His prayer book, «ÅGoa-tsi «Éui-tsi gei- tseti-«Åaegu«Ägoreti, also appeared after his death, in 1905. Meanwhile, Kr√∂nlein was ordained on January 1, 1887, as the first dedicated pastor for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa congregation at St. John's Church in Wynberg when the latter congregation was separated from St. Martin's in Cape Town. Initially disappointed in the congregation, he concentrated his ministry on the German immigrant farmers of the Cape Flats. When he suddenly died of pneumonia in early 1892, St. John's was growing so rapidly that expansion was already being considered. Kr√∂nlein and his wife, who survived him, are buried in the old cemetery of the Lutheran church on Wetton and Prince George Roads in Wynberg. Portraits of him remain in the archives of the RMS, and Heinrich Vedder published a profile of Kr√∂nlein as Am Lagerfeuer der andern (Windhoek, 1942). In St. John's Church of Wynberg, there is a commemorative marble plaque and an altarpiece (depicting the Resurrection) purchased in Berlin to honor him. == Sources == (af) De Kock, W.J. 1968.

She made her first solo debut with Passageways in the Jersey City Museum, opening March 19, 2009. ==Work== A recurring theme in her work is the passage of time and its effect on cultures, she compares the environment and human civilization in a way to make the viewer question their relationship with both and thus define what they expect from their culture and themselves. Ms. De Carvalho mixes influences of Pop Art and Spanish Informalism to create works which draw attention to the strange beauty of unbridled urbanization and pay reverence to architecture as an art form. Her installations art and murals often include paintings with augmented surfaces which encourage the spectator to engage with the art as a three-dimensional subject, sometimes by expanding the images into interactive landscapes. Priscila's work has been exhibited by the Brooklyn Bridge Park (New York, USA), The Bronx Museum of the Arts (New York, USA), Socrates Sculpture Park (New York, USA), the Basque Museum-Center of Contemporary Art (Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain), Deutsche Bank (New York, USA), the Grand Palais (Paris, France), the Nepal Art Council in (Kathmandu, Nepal), The Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts (New York, USA), The Jersey City Museum (Jersey City, USA).

His father, Jean-Bonaventure Rousseau, was a fur trader, operating out of the area around Lake Ontario. Through his own work in the fur trade, Rousseau learned the languages of the local First Nations. In 1770 Rousseau's father was licensed to trade fur at the mouth of what is now known as the Humber River, a stopping place for First Nations people travelling from Lake Ontario to the upper lakes. Rousseau had strong ties with Joseph Brant, the influential Mohawk leader who had fought with the British during the American Revolution. His second wife, Margaret Clyne, was Brant's adopted daughter. Rousseau and his wife named one of their sons Joseph Brant. Rousseau would later purchase 12,000 acres of Mohawk land through Brant. John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, granted Rousseau 500 acres around his fur trading post on the eastern bank of the Humber River in what is now the Swansea neighbourhood. Rousseau became one of the first merchants in York, and later Hamilton. He was owner, or part-owner, of multiple grist mills and taverns, in Kingston, York, Ancaster and Brantford. Rousseau had been a long-time officer in the militia. He was a Lieutenant Colonel when he served during the Battle of Queenston Heights, in October 1812.

Its mission is to raise awareness, provide health information and to support medical research that may lead to improvement in the management, prevention and potential cure for rosacea. ==History== Although rosacea was first described by Guy de Chauliac in the 14th century and included Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, when the National Rosacea Society was founded in 1992 rosacea was still considered a rare disease, and its first approved treatment, topical metronidazole, received orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the belief that fewer than 200,000 Americans suffered from it. It soon became evident that rosacea affected the lives of millions, who had previously failed to realize they had a medical condition that could be treated. A 2018 study estimated global incidence of rosacea to be more than 5%, or equivalent to around 415 million. ==Awareness== The National Rosacea Society designates each April as Rosacea Awareness Month and conducts national communications, public relations, and social media activities throughout the year. The society also produces patient education materials. ==Support for Research== In 1999, the National Rosacea Society launched a patient-funded research grants program to support scientific research into potential causes and other key aspects of rosacea that may lead to improvements in its management, prevention, or potential cure. Because the etiology of rosacea is unknown, a high priority in awarding grants is given to studies relating to such areas as the pathogenesis, progression, mechanism of action, cell biology and potential genetic factors of rosacea. Research in such areas as epidemiology, predisposition, quality of life and relationships with environmental and lifestyle factors may also be funded. Since its inception, more than $1.5 million has been awarded to support more than 70 studies. ==Publications== To provide a basis for meaningful scientific investigation, the NRS organized a consensus committee and review panel of 21 medical experts to establish a standard definition and classification system for rosacea, published in 2002, as well as a standard grading system published in 2004. The classification system was instrumental in establishing the clinical subtypes ‚Äî erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea, and ocular rosacea ‚Äî commonly used to describe the disease. In 2009, an NRS consensus committee and review panel of 26 medical experts published standard management options for rosacea. In 2017, an NRS consensus committee and review panel of 28 medical experts published an updated classification and pathophysiology of rosacea, reflecting the increased understanding of the disease and its progression gained in the 15 years since the original classification was published. The updated classification shifted focus away from subtypes to a phenotype approach to diagnosis. The article was accompanied by an editorial on rosacea comorbidities and areas for future research. In 2020, an NRS consensus committee and review panel of 27 medical experts published updates standard management options for rosacea, intended to provide a comprehensive summary of treatment options for the respective phenotypes identified in the updated standard classification of rosacea, and recommending that physicians to tailor therapy to each patient's individual case. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Charities based in Illinois Category:Health charities in the United States Category:Dermatology organizations ","title":"National Rosacea Society"},{"id":"60362251","text":"The Danger Signal, Canavan, the Man Who Had His Way or Caravan is a 1915 American drama silent black and white film directed by Walter Edwin and produced by George Kleine.

It is a basic algorithm in graph theory which can be used as a part of other graph algorithms. For instance, BFS is used by Dinic's algorithm to find maximum flow in a graph. Moreover, BFS is also one of kernel algorithms in Graph500 benchmark, which is a benchmark for data-intensive supercomputing problems.Graph500 This article discusses the possibility of speeding up BFS through the use of parallel computing. == Serial breadth-first search == In the conventional sequential BFS algorithm, two data structures are created to store the frontier and the next frontier. The frontier contains the vertexes that have same distance(it is also called \\"level\\") from the source vertex, these vertexes need to be explored in BFS. Every neighbor of these vertexes will be checked, some of these neighbors which are not explored yet will be discovered and put into the next frontier. At the beginning of BFS algorithm, a given source vertex s is the only vertex in the frontier. All direct neighbors of s are visited in the first step, which form the next frontier. After each layer-traversal, the \\"next frontier\\" is switched to the frontier and new vertexes will be stored in the new next frontier. The following pseudo-code outlines the idea of it, in which the data structures for the frontier and next frontier are called FS and NS respectively. 1 define bfs_sequential(graph(V,E), source s): 2 for all v in V do 3 d[v] = -1; 4 d[s] = 0; level = 0; FS = {}; NS = {}; 5 push(s, FS); 6 while FS !empty do 7 for u in FS do 8 for each neighbour v of u do 9 if d[v] = -1 then 10 push(v, NS); 11 d[v] = level; 12 FS = NS, NS = {}, level = level + 1; == First step of parallelization == As a simple and intuitive solution, the classic Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) approach is just an extension of the sequential algorithm that is shown above. The two for-loops (line 7 and line 8) can be executed in parallel. The update of the next frontier (line 10) and the increase of distance (line 11) need to be atomic. Atomic operations are program operations that can only run entirely without interruption and pause. A PRAM Model. However, there are two problems in this simple parallelization. Firstly, the distance-checking (line 9) and distance-updating operations (line 11) introduce two benign races. The reason of race is that a neighbor of one vertex can also be the neighbor of another vertex in the frontier. As a result, the distance of this neighbor may be examined and updated more than one time. Although these races waste resource and lead to unnecessary overhead, with the help of synchronization, they don't influence the correctness of BFS, so these races are benign. Secondly, in spite of the speedup of each layer-traversal due to parallel processing, a barrier synchronization is needed after every layer in order to completely discover all neighbor vertexes in the frontier. This layer-by-layer synchronization indicates that the steps of needed communication equals the longest distance between two vertexes, O(d), where O is the big O notation and d is the graph diameter. This simple parallelization's asymptotic complexity is same as sequential algorithm in the worst case, but some optimizations can be made to achieve better BFS parallelization, for example: 1\\\\. Mitigating barrier synchronization. Barrier synchronization is necessary after each layer- traversal to ensure the correctness of parallel BFS. As a result, reducing the cost of barrier synchronization is an effective way to speed up parallel BFS. 2\\\\. Load-balancing for neighbor discovering. Because there is a barrier synchronization after each layer-traversal, every processing entity must wait until the last of them finish its work. Therefore, the parallel entity which has the most neighbors decides the time consumption of this layer. With the optimization of load-balancing, the time of layer-traversal can be reduced. 3\\\\. Improving the locality of memory references. In parallel system with distributed memory, remote memory reference are getting data from other processing entities, which has usually extra communication cost compared to local memory reference. Thus, local memory reference is faster than remote memory reference. By designing a better data structure or improving the organization of data can lead to more local memory references and reduce the communications needed for remote memory references. == Parallel BFS with shared memory == Compared to parallel BFS with distributed memory, shared memory provides higher memory-bandwidth and lower latency. Because all processors share the memory together, all of them have the direct access to it. Thus, the developers don't need to program message passing process, which is necessary for distributed memory to get data from remote local memory. Therefore, the overhead of messages is avoided.\\"Designing multithreaded algorithms for breadth-first search and st-connectivity on the Cray MTA-2.\\", Bader, David A., and Kamesh Madduri. 2006 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'06). IEEE, 2006.A shared memory model. However, the number of vertexes in each layer and the number of neighbors of each vertex are shown to be highly irregular, which leads to highly irregular memory accesses and work distribution of BFS. In parallel BFS, this feature reduces the benefits from parallelization due to unbalanced load. As a result, especially for parallel BFS, it is very important to make the parallel BFS on shared memory load- balanced. Moreover, exploring the data-locality can also speed up parallel process. Many parallel BFS algorithms on shared memory can be divided into two types: container centric approaches and vertex centric approaches.\\"Level- synchronous parallel breadth-first search algorithms for multicore and multiprocessor systems.\\", Rudolf, and Mathias Makulla. FC 14 (2014): 26-31.] In the container centric approach, two data structures are created to store the current frontier and the next vertex frontier. The next vertex frontier is switched to the current frontier at the last of each step. There is a trade- off between the cost for synchronization and data locality according to the place where the data is stored. These two data structures can be held in every processing entity(such as thread) which supports data locality but needs extra load balancing mechanisms. Alternatively, they can be global to provide implicit load balancing, where special data structures are used for concurrent access from processing entities. But then those processing entities will work concurrently and more effort are required for synchronization. Besides, data organization of containers can be optimized. The typical data structure in serial BFS and some parallel BFS is FIFO Queue, as it is simple and fast where insertion and delete operation costs only constant time. Another alternative is the bag-structure\\"A work-efficient parallel breadth-first search algorithm (or how to cope with the nondeterminism of reducers).\\", Leiserson, Charles E., and Tao B. Schardl. Proceedings of the twenty-second annual ACM symposium on Parallelism in algorithms and architectures. ACM, 2010.. The insertion operation in a bag takes O(logn) time in the worst-case, whereas it takes only constant amortized time which is as fast as FIFO. Furthermore, union of two bags takes Œò(lgn) time where n is the number of elements in the smaller bag. The bag-split operation also takes Œò(lgn) time. With the help of bag- structure, a certain number of vertexes(according to granularity parameter) are stored in one bag and the bag-structure becomes the basic parallel entity. Moreover, the reducer can be combined with the bag-structure to write vertexes in parallel and traverse them efficiently. The vertex centric approach treats vertex as parallel entityÔºåwhich enables parallel iteration. Each vertex is assigned to a parallel entity. This vertex centric approach might only work well if the graph depth is very low. Graph depth in BFS is defined as the maximum distance of any vertex in the graph to the source vertex. Therefore, the vertex centric approach is well-suited for GPUs if every thread is mapped to exactly one vertex. == Parallel BFS with distributed memory == In the distributed memory model, each processing entity has its own memory. Because of this, processing entities must send and receive messages to each other to share its local data or get access to remote data.A distributed memory model. === 1-D partitioning === 1D partitioning is the simplest way to combine the parallel BFS with distributed memory. It is based on vertex partition. Load balancing is still an important issue for data partition, which determines how we can benefit from parallelization. In other words, each processor with distributed memory(e.g. processor) should be in charge of approximately same number of vertexes and their outgoing edges. For the implementation of data storage, each processor can store an adjacency matrix of its local vertexes, in which each row for each vertex is a row of outgoing edges represented by destination vertex indices. Different from shared memory BFS, the neighbor vertex from one processor may be stored in another processor. As a result, each processor is responsible to tell those processors about traversal status through sending them messages. Moreover, each processor should also deal with the messages from all other processors to construct its local next vertex frontier. Obviously, one all-to-all communication(which means each entity has different messages for all others) is necessary in each step when exchanging the current frontier and the next vertex frontier. The following pseudo-code of 1-D distributed memory BFS shows more details, which comes from the paper\\"A scalable distributed parallel breadth-first search algorithm on BlueGene/L.\\", Yoo, Andy, et al. Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing. IEEE Computer Society, 2005.. This algorithm is originally designed for IBM BlueGene/L systems, which has a 3D torus network architecture. Because the synchronization is the main extra cost for parallelized BFS, the authors of this paper also developed a scalable all-to- all communication based on point-to-point communications. After that, they also reduced the number of point-to-point communication, taking advantage of its high-bandwidth torus network. The main steps of BFS traversal in the following algorithm are: # processor view(line 8): construct the frontier FS with vertexes from local storage # global view(line 10-11): terminate the traversal if FS from all processors are empty # processor view(line 13): construct the next frontier based on the neighbors vertex of its FS, although some of their neighbors may be stored in other processors # global view(line 15-18): run an all-to-all communication to let each processor know, which local vertexes should be put into its local next frontier NS # processor view(line 20-22): receive messages from all other processors, update the distance value of their local vertexes in the current frontier, change its NS to FS 1 define 1_D_distributed_memory_BFS( graph(V,E), source s): 2 //normal initialization 3 for all v in V do 4 d[v] = -1; 5 d[s] = 0; level = 0; FS = {}; NS = {}; 6 //begin BFS traversal 7 while True do: 8 FS = {the set of local vertexes with level} 9 //all vertexes traversed 10 if FS={} for all processors then: 11 terminate the while loop 12 //construct the NS based on local vertexes in current frontier 13 NS = {neighbors of vertexes in FS, both local and not local vertexes} 14 //synchronization: all-to-all communication 15 for 0 <= j < p do: 16 N_j = {vertexes in NS owned by processor j} 17 send N_j to processor j 18 receive N_j_rcv from processor j 19 //combine the received message to form local next vertex frontier then update the level for them 20 NS_rcv = Union(N_j_rcv) 21 for v in NS_rcv and d[v] == -1 do 22 d[v] = level+1 Combined with multi-threading, the following pseudo code of 1D distributed memory BFS also specifies thread stack and thread barrier, which comes from the paper.\\"Parallel breadth-first search on distributed memory systems.\\", Bulu√ß, Aydin, and Kamesh Madduri. Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis. ACM, 2011. With multi-threading, local vertexes in the frontier FS can be divided and assigned to different threads inside of one processor, which further parallel the BFS traversal. However, different from the methods above, we need more data structure for each individual threads. For instance, the thread stack, which is prepared for saving the neighbor vertexes from the vertexes of this thread. Each thread has p-1 local storage, where p is the number of processors. Because each thread must separate the messages for all other processors. For example, they will put their neighbor vertexes in their j-th stack to form the message send to j processor, if j processor is the owner of those vertexes. Moreover, Thread barrier is also necessary for synchronization. As a result, although distributed memory with multi-threading might benefit from refinement of parallelization, it also introduces extra synchronization cost for threads. The main steps of BFS traversal in the following algorithm are: # thread view(line 19-22): based on vertexes assigned to itself, find the owner processor of neighbor vertexes, put them into thread stack base on their owners. # processor view(line 23): run a thread barrier, wait until all threads(of the same processor) finish their job. # processor view(line 25-26): merge all thread stacks of all threads, which has the same owner(those have the destination for next step). # global view(line 28-30): run an all-to-all communication with master thread to let each processor know, which local vertexes should be put into the next frontier. # processor view(line 31): run a thread barrier, wait until the communication finished(of master thread). # processor view(line 33): assign vertexes from the next frontier to each thread. # thread view(line 34-36): if the vertex is not visited, update the distance value for their vertexes and put it in thread stack for the next frontier NS. # processor view(line 37): run a thread barrier, wait until all threads(of the same processor) finish their job. # processor view(line 39): aggregate thread stacks for the next frontier from every thread # processor view(line 40): run a thread barrier, wait until all threads send all their vertexes in their stack. 1 define 1_D_distributed_memory_BFS_with_threads( graph(V,E), source s): 2 //normal initialization 3 for all v in V do 4 d[v] = -1; 5 level = 1; FS = {}; NS = {}; 6 //find the index of the owner processor of source vertex s 7 pu_s = find_owner(s); 8 if pu_s = index_pu then 9 push(s,FS); 10 d[s] = 0; 11 //message initialization 12 for 0 <= j < p do 13 sendBuffer_j = {} // p shared message buffers 14 recvBuffer_j = {} // for MPI communication 15 thrdBuffer_i_j = {} //thread-local stack for thread i 16 // begin BFS traversal 17 while FS != {} do 18 //traverse vertexes and find owners of neighbor vertexes 19 for each u in FS in parallel do 20 for each neighbor v of u do 21 pu_v = find_owner(v) 22 push(v,thrdBuffer_i_(pu_v)) 23 Thread Barrier 24 //combine thread stack to form sendBuffer 25 for 0 <= j < p do 26 merge thrdBuffer_i_j in parallel 27 //all-to-all communication 28 All-to-all collective step with master thread: 29 1. send data in sendBuffer 30 2. receive and aggregate newly-visited vertexes into recvBuffer 31 Thread Barrier 32 // update level for new-visited vertexes 33 for each u in recvBuffer in parallel do 34 if d[u] == -1 then 35 d[u] = level 36 push(u, NS_i) 37 Thread Barrier 38 //aggregate NS and form new FS 39 FS = Union(NS_i) 40 Thread Barrier 41 level = level + 1f === 2-D partitioning === Because BFS algorithm always uses the adjacency matrix as the representation of the graph. The natural 2D decomposition of matrix can also be an option to consider. In 2D partitioning, each processor has a 2D index (i,j). The edges and vertexes are assigned to all processors with 2D block decomposition, in which the sub- adjacency matrix is stored. If there are in total P=R¬∑C processors, then the adjacency matrix will be divided like below: 2D-partition of the adjacency matrix. There are C columns and R¬∑C block rows after this division. For each processor, they are in charge of C blocks, namely the processor (i,j) stores Ai,j(1) to Ai,j(C) blocks. The conventional 1D partitioning is equivalent to the 2D partitioning with R=1 or C=1. In general, the parallel edge processing based on 2D partitioning can be organized in 2 communication phases, which are \\"expand\\" phase and \\"fold\\" phase. In the \\"expand\\" phase, if the edge list for a given vertex is the column of the adjacency matrix, then for each vertex v in the frontier, the owner of v is responsible to tell other processors in its processor column that v is visited. That's because each processor only stores partial edge lists of vertexes. After this communication, each processor can traverse the column of according to the vertexes and find out their neighbors to form the next frontier. In the \\"fold\\" phase, vertexes in resulting next frontier are sent to their owner processors to form the new frontier locally. With 2D partitioning, these processors are in the same processor row. The main steps of BFS traversal in this 2D partitioning algorithm are(for each processor): # expand phase(line 13-15): based on local vertexes, only send messages to processors in processor-column to tell them these vertexes are in the frontier, receive messages from these processors. # (line 17-18): merge all receiving messages and form the net frontier N. Notice that not all vertexes from received messages should be put into the next frontier, some of them may be visited already. The next frontier only contains vertexes that has the distance value -1. # fold phase(line 20-23): based on the local vertexes in next frontier, send messages to owner processors of these vertexes in processor-row. # (line 25-28): merge all receiving messages and update the distance value of vertexes in the next frontier. The pseudo-code below describes more details of 2D BFS algorithm, which comes from the paper: 1 define 2_D_distributed_memory_BFS( graph(V,E), source s): 2 //normal initialization 3 for all v in V do 4 d[v] = -1; 5 d[s] = 0; 6 //begin BFS traversal 7 for l = 0 to infinite do: 8 F = {the set of local vertexes with level l} 9 //all vertexes traversed 10 if F={} for all processors then: 11 terminate the while loop 12 //traverse vertexes by sending message to selected processor 13 for all processor q in this processor-column do: 14 Send F to processor q 15 Receive Fqr from q 16 //deal with the receiving information after the frontier traversal 17 Fr = Union{Fqr} for all q 18 N = {neighbors of vertexes in Fr using edge lists on this processor} 19 //broadcast the neighbor vertexes by sending message to their owner processor 20 for all processor q in this processor-row do: 21 Nq = {vertexes in N owned by processor q} 22 Send Nq to processor q 23 Receive Nqr from q 24 //form the next frontier used for next layer traversal 25 Nr = Union{Nqr} for all q 26 //layer distance update 27 for v in Nr and d(v)=-1 do: 28 level = l+1 In 2D partitioning, only columns or rows of processors participate in communication in \\"expand\\" or \\"fold\\" phase respectively. This is the advantage of 2D partitioning over 1D partitioning, because all processors are involved in the all-to-all communication operation in 1D partitioning. Besides, 2D partitioning is also more flexible for better load balancing, which makes a more scalable and storage-efficient approach much easier. === Implementation optimization strategies === Aside from basic ideas of parallel BFS, some optimization strategies can be used to speed up parallel BFS algorithm and improve the efficiency. There are already several optimizations for parallel BFS, such as direction optimization, load balancing mechanism and improved data structure and so on. ==== Direction optimization ==== In original top-down BFS, each vertex should examine all neighbors of vertex in the frontier. This is sometimes not effective, when the graph has a low diameter.\\"Collective dynamics of ‚Äòsmall-world‚Äô networks.\\", Watts, Duncan J., and Steven H. Strogatz. nature 393.6684 (1998): 440. but some vertexes inside have much higher degrees than average, such as a small-world graph\\"Direction-optimizing breadth-first search.\\", Beamer, Scott, Krste Asanoviƒá, and David Patterson. Scientific Programming 21.3-4 (2013): 137-148.. As mentioned before, one benign race in parallel BFS is that, if more than one vertex in the frontier has common neighbor vertexes, the distance of neighbor vertexes will be checked many times. Although the distance update is still correct with the help of synchronization, the resource is wasted. In fact, to find the vertexes for the next frontier, each unvisited vertex only need to check if any its neighbor vertex is in the frontier. This is also the core idea for direction optimization. Even better is that, each vertex would quickly find a parent by checking its incoming edges if a significant number of its neighbors are in the frontier. In the paper, the authors introduce a bottom-up BFS where each vertex only needs to check whether any of their parents is in the frontier. This can be determined efficient if the frontier is represented by a bitmap. Compared to the top-down BFS, bottom-up BFS reduces the fail checking by self-examining the parent to prevent contention. However, bottom-up BFS requires serializing work of one vertex and only works better when a large fraction of vertexes are in the frontier. As a result, a direction optimized BFS should combine the top-down and the bottom-up BFS. More accurately, the BFS should start with the top-down direction, switch to the bottom-up BFS when the number of vertex exceeds a given threshold and vice versa. ==== Load balance ==== Load balancing is very important not only in parallel BFS but also in all parallel algorithms, because balanced work can improve the benefit of parallelization. In fact, almost all of parallel BFS algorithm designers should observe and analyze the work partitioning of their algorithm and provide a load balancing mechanism for it. Randomization is one of the useful and simple ways to achieve load balancing. For instance, in paper, the graph is traversed by randomly shuffling all vertex identifiers prior to partitioning. ==== Data structure ==== An example of CSR representation of a directed graph. Pennant data structure for k=0 to k=3. An example of bag structure with 23 elements. There are some special data structures that parallel BFS can benefit from, such as CSR(Compressed Sparse Row), bag-structure, bitmap and so on. In the CSR, all adjacencies of a vertex is sorted and compactly stored in a contiguous chunk of memory, with adjacency of vertex i+1 next to the adjacency of i. In the example on the left, there are two arrays, C and R. Array C stores the adjacency lists of all nodes. Array R stored the index in C, the entry R[i] points to the beginning index of adjacency lists of vertex i in array C. The CSR is extremely fast because it costs only constant time to access vertex adjacency. But it is only space- efficient for 1D partitioning. More information about CSR can be found in \\"Scalable GPU Graph Traversal\\", Merrill, Duane, Michael Garland, and Andrew Grimshaw. Acm Sigplan Notices. Vol. 47. No. 8. ACM, 2012.. For 2D partitioning, DCSC(Doubly compressed sparse columns) for hyper-sparse matrices is more suitable, more information about DCSC can be found in the paper \\"On the representation and multiplication of hypersparse matrices.\\"Buluc, Aydin, and John R. Gilbert. 2008 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing. IEEE, 2008. In the paper, the authors develop a new data structure called bag-structure. Bag structure is constructed from the pennant data structure. A pennant is a tree of 2k nodex, where k is a nonnegative integer. Each root x in this tree contains two pointers x.left and x.right to its children. The root of the tree has only a left child, which is a complete binary tree of the remaining elements. The bag structure is the collection of pennants with a backbone array S. Each entry S[i] in S is either a null pointer or a pointer to a pennant with size si. The insertion operation in a bag takes O(1) amortized time and the union of two bags takes Œò(lgn) time. The bag-split takes also Œò(lgn) time. With this bag-structure, parallel BFS is allowed to write the vertexes of a layer in a single data structure in parallel and later efficiently traverse them in parallel. Moreover, bitmap is also a very useful data structure to memorize which vertexes are already visited, regardless in the bottom-up BFS.\\"Distributed-memory breadth-first search on massive graphs.\\"Buluc, Aydin, et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.04590 (2017). or just to check if vertexes are visited in the top-down BFS == Benchmarks == Graph500 is the first benchmark for data-intensive supercomputing problems. This benchmark generates an edge tuple with two endpoints at first. Then the kernel 1 will constructs an undirected graph, in which weight of edge will not be assigned if only kernel 2 runs afterwards. Users can choose to run BFS in kernel 2 and/or Single-Source-Shortest-Path in kernel 3 on the constructed graph. The result of those kernels will be verified and running time will be measured. Graph500 also provides two reference implementations for kernel 2 and 3. In the referenced BFS, the exploration of vertexes is simply sending messages to target processors to inform them of visited neighbors. There is no extra load balancing method. For the synchronization, AML(Active Messages Library, which is an SPMD communication library build on top of MPI3, intend to be used in fine grain applications like Graph500) barrier ensures the consistent traversal after each layer. The referenced BFS is only used for correctness verification of results. Thus, users should implement their own BFS algorithm based on their hardware. The choice of BFS is not constrained, as long as the output BFS tree is correct. The correctness of result is based on the comparison with result from referenced BFS. Because only 64 search key are sampled to runs kernel 2 and/or kernel 3, the result is also considered correct when this result is different from referenced result only because the search key is not in samples. These 64 search keys also run the kernel sequentially to compute mean and variance, with which the performance of a single search is measured. Different from TOP500, the performance metric in Graph500 is Traversed Edges Per Second(TEPS). == See also == * Parallel algorithm * Distributed algorithm == Reference == Category:Graph algorithms Category:Parallel computing ","title":"Parallel breadth-first search"},{"id":"60362305","text":"Soliman is a surname.

It was the home of the Clarkson varsity ice hockey team from 1938 to 1991. It is currently used by Clarkson University for a variety of purposes after a $1 million renovation in 2008. ==History== Ice hockey began at Clarkson in 1921 when Murray Walker and Gordon Croskery organized an ice hockey club for the college. The team became popular and successful enough that the program was formally established in 1935 and an indoor rink was needed to replace the outdoor surface at Ives Park. The Clarkson Arena was completed in 1938 and played home to the ice hockey program for the next 53 years. The building was renovated multiple times, first in 1952 when artificial ice was installed then again in 1971 when heating and additional seats were added. In 1975 the building was renamed the Murray G. Walker Hockey Arena (known as the Walker Arena) in honor of the father of Clarkson ice hockey. By the late 1980s the building was beginning to show its age and plans for its replacement soon came to pass. The Walker Arena was sent out on a high note, however, as the 1990‚Äì91 men's team won its first conference tournament in 25 years with their two quarterfinal wins being the last games played at the Arena.

She is known internationally for sculptural works and installations created from plastic debris, primarily from marine and coastal environments, as a primary material. Much of her work includes community-based research, such as carbon or plastic audits, as well as collaborative art creation. In 2013, Longobardi was awarded The Hudgens Prize https://thehudgens.org/hudgens-prize/ and in 2014, she earned the title Distinguished University Professor of Art at Georgia State, and was named Artist-in-Residence of the Oceanic Society. In 2019, she was appointed Regents‚Äô Professor by the Board of Regents for the State of Georgia. ==Early life and education== Pam Longobardi grew up in New Jersey, the child of an ocean lifeguard and a Delaware state diving champion, and credits her parents' relationship to the water with her own scientific and artistic interests. Longobardi moved to Atlanta in 1970. She received a B.S. in Science Education from Montana State University in 1982. Longobardi then went on to earn her M.F.A. degree, also from Montana State University. ==Career== The entanglement of science and art is central to Longobardi's practice and aesthetic: \\"I see some aspects of the methodology of the artist and scientist as very similar: long periods of intensive research, immersion in materials to better understand their properties, inquisitiveness and curiosity as driving forces, a desire to unpack ‚Äòreality‚Äô to better understand our relationship to it.\\" Since 2006, Longobardi has been engaged in The Drifters Project. Begun in 2006, its name taken from the term drift ‚Äì objects that are carried by currents and air. Ocean drift is, today, primarily plastic. Longobardi has collected this drift plastic to create abstract sculptures and installations. One iteration of The Drifters Project was displayed at the 2009 Venice Biennale, at the ARTE VISIVI collateral exhibitions. In 2010, Edizione Charta (Milan, NY) produced a photo-essay book entitled Drifters: Plastics, Pollution, Personhood that included photographs and essays by Longobardi and three other writers.https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26052308M/Drifters_Plastics_Pollution_And_Personhood \\"All these things collapse for me in the drifting ocean plastic object: it IS an artifact of my specific human evolutionary time; it IS made from petroleum that is the fossil sunlight and ancient plants, animals and yes, dinosaurs, that roamed the past Earth; it IS a biological raft for invasive creatures; it IS a toxic floating time bomb that is changing the human and animal body and the very ocean itself; and it IS a future fossil of the Anthropocene.\\" In 2013 Longobardi was selected to be lead artist in the GYRE Expedition, an art- science research expedition that assembled a team of notable marine scientists, journalists, filmmakers and artists to trawl remote Alaskan coastlines and to document collaboratively the impacts of plastic pollution on these delicate ecosystems. Her colleagues on the expedition included chief exhibition scientist Carl Safina, artist Mark Dion, filmmaker J.J. Kelly, photographer Andy Hughes, and others: all of these are featured, along with Longobardi, in a twenty-minute National Geographic film, GYRE, which aired in 2013. Of Longobardi, Dion says \\"Her knowledge of the subject and commitment is extraordinary.\\" The artistic outcomes from this expedition were shown first at the exhibition entitled Gyre: The Plastic Ocean at the Anchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center in Anchorage, Alaska, a show which later travelled to the CDC's Museum in Atlanta, Georgia and other museums across the U.S.. Longobardi's contributions include \\"Economies of Scale\\" and \\"Bounty, Pilfered,\\" both characteristic of her sculptural found-plastic installations. Longobardi uses \\"materials like sulfurated potash and sodium chloride to oxidize expanses of copper, pouring and wiping different mixtures over the surfaces\\" to make scenes that \\"appear otherworldly\\" but in a series entitled Anthropocene, she \\"keeps them decidedly earth-based.\\" Longobardi also produces paintings with an \\"elemental aesthetic,\\" incorporating natural processes such as chemical patinas that also crystallize; light-sensitive photo imaging, magnetism, mirror reflection, after-image, and phosphorescence. ==Awards== * 2019 Regents Professor, awarded by the Board of Regents for the State of Georgia.https://news.gsu.edu/2019/06/28/pam-longobardi-awarded-regents- professorship/ *2016 Focus Fellowship Award *2016 Special Honorary Mention for Plastic Free Island (short film), Cinemare International Ocean Film Festival, Kiel, Germany *2016 Bronze Award, Short Films Category, Spotlight Film Awards *2016 Artist Residency Fellowship, Ionian Center for Arts and Culture (Kefalonia, Greece) *2014 Distinguished University Professor, Georgia State University *2014 Artist-in-Residence of the Oceanic Society *2013 The Hudgens Prize ==Reviews== * Keck, Terra. 2019. ‚ÄúHarbingers and Oracles.‚Äù ART511 Magazine.art511mag.com/2019/10/08/harbingers-and-oracles * Bell, Ellen. 2017. ‚ÄúA Culture Defined by What It Discards: Art for the Anthropocene.‚Äù PLANET Magazine.

He holds a PhD in Political Science from Southern Illinois University and a law degree from the University of Illinois. Reilly's research focuses on empirical testing of political claims. == Work == === Hate Crime Hoax === Reilly's book Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War, was published by Regnery Publishing in February 2019. For the book, Reilly assembled a data set of 409 allegedly false or dubious hate crime allegations (concentrated during the past five years), which he describes as hoaxes on the basis of reports in mainstream national or regional news sources. Reilly has stated this data set is available to anyone who requests it. He uses this data to support his claim that a substantial percentage of all hate crime allegations must be hoaxes, given that, per his analysis, only about 7,000 reported hate crimes take place in a typical year, and at most 8‚Äì10% of these receive the national or regional reporting that is required for inclusion in his data set. In the wake of the Jussie Smollett alleged assault, Reilly authored an editorial outlining his case in USA Today. After interviewing Reilly, the Washington Post argued that hate crimes are on the rise and a relatively small percentage of allegations are hoaxes, but quoted him as saying \\"It‚Äôs politicization to say there‚Äôs a massive surge of hate\\" under President Donald Trump and that political liberals tend to characterize all hate crimes as \\"attacks on innocent people of color\\" when \\"you don't know what happened\\". Reilly, who is African American, has appeared or been quoted in television, radio and print media outlets, claiming that many or most recent high profile hate crimes (e.g. Jussie Smollett, Yasmin Seweid) have turned out to be hoaxes. === Other work === On April 21, 2016, Reilly participated in a regionally televised debate against alt-right personality Jared Taylor. Reilly argued for the social value of diversity, contending that it makes life \\"more interesting, civilized, and fun,\\" and using published research to point out that mono-racial societies (e.g. Bosnia, Somalia) are often no more peaceful or less conflicted than multi-racial societies, due to the greater prevalence of tribal in-fighting within them. Taylor took the anti-diversity position. Reilly's PhD thesis, submitted in 2015, was titled The Effect of Racial Status and Other Core Characteristics on Collective Self- Esteem: A Quantitative Test of Divergent Theories of Identity Valuation. In 2019, he published a summary of his thesis in Commentary magazine. In January 2020, Reilly published Taboo, a book in which he argues that certain race, gender, and class issues can no longer be discussed in mainstream American society. == Views == In 2016, Reilly criticized then-candidate Donald Trump for allegedly dog-whistling to the alt-right, and described the 2016 United States presidential campaign as \\"shining light on some dark corners of the Internet.\\" == References == Category:Living people Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:African-American academics Category:African-American social scientists Category:American social scientists Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American political commentators Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Wilfred Reilly"},{"id":"60362578","text":"Naimer may refer to: *Kraus & Naimer, Austrian company producing switchgear, co-founded by Lorentz Naimer (1868‚Äì1944) *Karen Naimer, Canadian lawyer ","title":"Naimer"},{"id":"60362585","text":"The Stow-Hasbrouck House is a single-family home located at 412 South Clinton Street in Convis Township, Michigan, near Marshall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==History== In 1835, Eli Crouch, likely an investor, purchased this property. In 1836 he sold it to Granville and Catherine Stow, who had just moved to the area from Onondaga County, New York. It is most likely that the house was built by the Stows, probably soon after they arrived. Local lore has it that the stone section of the house was built over the period 1837-41 by Andrew Pettigrew, an itinerant stone mason from New Paltz, New York; the rear ell was likely added a few years later. The Stows sold the house and property in 1846 to David Wood of Fairfield, Ohio. Wood was apparently having mental problems, and in 1859 was declared incompetent. A guardian was appointed by the court, ind in 1861 the property was sold to Matthew Hasbrouck. Matthew Hasbrouck had been born in 1814 in New Paltz, New York, and in 1839 moved with his new wife to a small hamlet in Jackson County, Michigan. They later moved to Washtenaw County before settling in this house in 1861. Matthew Hasbrouck lived in the house until his death in 1883. His property was apportioned among his widow, Hannah Hasbrouck. and other heirs. After a time, Hannah Hasbrouck moved to Ann Arbor, and their son Jehu Elting Hasbrouck moved into the house. He lived there until 1906, after which he found it impossible to continue farming the small plot of land left to him. He sold the house to Christopher C. Wheeler, who had already purchased the remainder of the Hasbrouck farm from other heirs. The house was rented out to Wheeler's servants, but by 1923 had been abandoned. However, Cecilia Hasbrouck Moran, a daughter of Jehu Elting Hasbrouck, purchased the house. Cecilia Moran and a friend, Marian Willcox, refurbished the house and opened a tearoom and gift shop in it in 1928. The tea room operated until 1935. She sold it to her niece, Rachel Bushong, and her husband, Max Bushong, who moved into the house in 1941. ==Description== The Stow-Hasbrouck House is a one-and- one-half-story, side-gable, fieldstone house.

She disappeared on July 19, 2016 and was found dead three days later. Her assailant, James D. Worley, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder, in addition to over twenty years in prison for the kidnapping, assault and other related charges. His execution is still pending appeal . Worley had been previously convicted and imprisoned for the assault and attempted kidnapping of another woman under markedly similar circumstances, but was released after three years, and was not listed in any state or federal offender database at the time of Joughin's murder. Consequently, the killing prompted the creation of Ohio Senate Bill 231 (\\"Sierah's Law\\"), a statute that provides for a searchable database of felons living in the state, who are convicted of specific violent offenses. The statute was signed into law in December 2018. == Sierah Joughin == Sierah Catherine Joughin was born in Sylvania, Ohio on February 11, 1996, to parents Sheila Vaculik and Tom Joughin. Nicknamed \\"Ce\\" by friends and family, she graduated from Evergreen High School in 2014. At the time of her death she was enrolled at University of Toledo's Junior College of Business, studying human resource management and interning at her uncle's metal stamping business. == James Worley == James D. Worley (April 8, 1959 - ) was born in Tacoma, Washington and graduated from Evergreen High School in Metamora, Ohio in 1978. He worked various jobs in Toledo, Ohio, as a farmer in Delta, and as a grounds crew member for several county fairs. Regarding his education, Worley attributed his 1.59 grade-point average to being a frequent user and seller of marijuana from the age of 14. In July 1990, Worley ambushed a young woman, Robin Gardner, while she was riding her bike in Whitehouse, Ohio. He struck her with his truck, got out of the vehicle, struck her on the head, and placed her in handcuffs. He then held a screwdriver to her throat and stated \\"I'll kill you if you don't stop screaming\\", and attempted to force her into the vehicle. Gardner was able to escape and was picked up by a passing motorist. Worley was ultimately arrested and convicted on abduction charges, and sentenced to 4 ‚Äì 10 years in prison, with the possibility of parole. He served three years in prison for the crime, before he was released early by his own petition. Worley returned to prison in 2000 when he was convicted of cultivating marijuana plants and possessing weapons while on disability, both felonies at that time. He was released two years later in 2002, again after petitioning for early release. After his second release from prison, he started a small business at his residence, and was licensed as a trailer transporter. == Murder, investigation and arrest == At approximately 6:45 PM on July 19, 2016, Joughin was riding her bicycle home from her boyfriend's house, while he rode alongside her in his motorcycle. They parted ways near County Road 6 near Delta, Ohio in Fulton County, as he turned around to return home, while she continued on. When she did not arrive at home that evening and her boyfriend reported to her family that he couldn't reach her by cell phone, they contacted authorities. Later that evening, Joughin's bicycle was discovered several rows into a cornfield near where she was last seen, and signs of a struggle, along with motorcycle tracks through the corn, were noted by the county sheriff. With the assistance of the FBI, authorities made efforts to track Joughin using her Fitbit activity tracker and smartphone, the latter of which returned a signal several miles from where her bicycle was located, but this did not produce any new leads. Rewards ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 were offered for any information leading to her safe recovery. Several items that did not belong to Joughin were discovered near her bicycle, including a pair of men's sunglasses (which tested positive for male DNA), a screwdriver and a box of automotive fuses. A passing driver also recovered a motorcycle helmet with a bloody hand print on its surface. Joughin's boyfriend was not considered a person of interest as his helmet could quickly be accounted for. When officers were canvassing the neighborhood after Joughin's disappearance, Worley, who lived under 2 miles away, told them his motorcycle had broken down in the area and that he had lost items of the same description as those at the crime scene. He also stated that he had discovered two bicycles in the corn, one of which he took, and that it would have his fingerprints on it. He commented that he \\"didn't steal anything or kill anyone.\\" Another witness in the area described seeing a passenger van driving at a high rate of speed through the area, and provided a license plate number to the authorities. The license plate was soon discovered to be registered to Worley, who had been convicted and sentenced in 1990 for assaulting and attempting to kidnap another woman, who he knocked off her bicycle. Investigators then obtained a search warrant for Worley's property. Upon searching a barn on Worley's property, authorities discovered a hidden room, where they found several pairs of women's underwear (on one of which, blood was found), restraints and a carpet-lined freezer stained with blood. They also found blood on Worley's motorcycle, as well as \\"zip-tie\\" restraints and a ski mask in his truck. Investigators found recording devices all over the property, and concluded from cell phone records that Worley was at the scene of the abduction for nearly two hours during the time Joughin was missing. They also discovered that Worley had stated to a court-mandated therapist, after his previous conviction, that he \\"learned from each abduction he had done and the next one he was going to bury\\". He was arrested on charges of abduction on July 22, three days after Joughin's disappearance. A spokesperson for the sheriff's office suggested that Worley fit the profile of a serial offender, and that he could potentially have additional unknown victims, possibly kept at the property. Despite an exhaustive search, neither Joughin nor any human remains were found there. On the same day Worley was arrested, at around 6:00 PM, Joughin's remains were discovered in a shallow grave in a field along County Road 7 in Delta, Ohio, a few miles southwest of Worley's property. Her body was found intact, hogtied (wrists handcuffed and bound to the ankles behind the back), a large plastic toy in her mouth functioning as a gag, and wearing an adult diaper. An autopsy determined the cause of death as asphyxiation, caused by the gag. There was no evidence of sexual assault. The precise time of death was not determined, but the official time of death was 9:00 PM on July 22, 2016, when she was declared dead by medical professionals. == Legal proceedings == === Indictment and arraignment === On August 16, 2016, Worley was indicted on nineteen counts and was jailed without bail. The charges included aggravated murder, kidnapping, felonious assault, abduction, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse. At his arraignment he entered a plea of not guilty on all charges. Prosecutors sought capital punishment for the aggravated murder charge. After two delays in September 2017 and January 2018, and hundreds of potential jurors called, trial testimony began in March 2018 at the Fulton County Common Pleas Court in Wauseon, Ohio, with Judge Jeffrey Robinson presiding over the case. === Allegations and defense summary === The prosecution alleged that Worley had watched pornography up until the crime was committed, as evidenced by his web browsing history. He ambushed Joughin after encountering her on County Road 6, struck her in the head with his motorcycle helmet (possibly knocking her unconscious, and leaving DNA evidence on the helmet), and waited in the cornfield until it was dark. During this time he called his brother to tell him his motorcycle had broken down, but prosecutors alleged he was actually next to Joughin in the cornfield when he placed the call. He then rode his motorcycle back home (less than five miles away), drove his van back to the crime scene (during which it was noticed speeding by a witness), and transported her back to the barn on his residence. There he left some of her blood-stained clothes, and physically assaulted, hog-tied and gagged her with a plastic toy. At some point, she asphyxiated from the gag, which prosecutors alleged Worley intended, as it was inserted with enough force to break a tooth. Worley then transported her body to the cornfield close to his property, which he buried approximately two feet deep. Worley denied having ever encountered or assaulting Joughin. His defense argued that the evidence obtained from the barn including the underwear, handcuffs and BDSM-related items were part of a pornography studio that Worley had intended on starting. Worley claimed that the helmet and other evidence found near Joughin's bicycle had been left behind by him before the disappearance took place, when his motorcycle had broken down on the side of the road. They alleged that because of the low concentration of Worley's DNA on the helmet, it may have been someone else who used it to assault Joughin. A witness saw a man crouched in a field wearing red shorts, but no red shorts were recovered at Worley's property, and his defense argued it therefore could not have been Worley in the cornfield. === Witnesses === Fulton County Courthouse in Wauseon, Ohio During the trial, the prosecution presented several witnesses, among them: * Megan Roberts, BCI Special Agent - testified about physical evidence recovered at the alleged kidnapping site, Worley's residence and the location where Joughin's body was found, much of which contained both Worley's and Joughin's DNA * David Morford, Toledo Police Detective - testified about digital evidence, such as cell phone records showing Worley in the vicinity of the crime scene for over two hours, and evidence on his home computer, including pornography searches for terms such as \\"hogtyed teen\\", \\"rape\\", \\"stranded\\" and \\"helpless\\" * Robin Gardner, previous victim of Worley - testified that in July 1990, Worley ran her down with his truck, held a screwdriver to her neck and threatened to kill her if she didn't come with him; a crime for which he was sentenced to 4‚Äì10 years in prison, but only served three before being released. Worley's defense team presented several witnesses; two of them were both longtime friends of Worley. The first acknowledged under cross-examination that the helmet found on County Road 6 on the night of Joughin's abduction was the same one he had bought for Worley several years prior. The second witness testified under cross-examination that he and Worley smoked marijuana and watched pornography together, and at one time Worley mentioned he wished to start a pornography studio in his barn, where at the time he was drying marijuana plants. He also stated that Worley was having electrical problems with his motorcycle, but \\"it never left him stranded\\". === Verdict and sentencing === Closing arguments for the trial concluded on March 26, 2018 and jury deliberations began the same day. Worley was found guilty on March 28, 2018 of seventeen of the original nineteen charges, including aggravated murder, after jurors deliberated for a total of less than six hours. Jury sentencing guidelines in Ohio required the jury to decide if any outweighing mitigating factors in Worley's case warranted a life sentence, or if any outweighing aggravating factors warranted a death sentence. Worley's defense argued for a life sentence, describing him as a \\"damaged man\\". Criminal psychologist Dr. John Fabian, a witness for the defense, suggested the attack was motivated by \\"sexual sadism connected with a fetish disorder\\". He stated Worley had multiple mental health issues, and had diagnosed him with Sexual Paraphilia Disorder. Worley's defense, during their closing statement, suggested that Worley may have had an unnamed accomplice and had an incestuous relationship with his mother before her death. The prosecution dismissed both claims, stating the gravesite was dug hastily, requiring only one person, and that there was little evidence to support an inappropriate relationship between Worley and his mother. The prosecution argued that because Worley had an average upbringing and knew the difference between right and wrong, the aggravating factors of his crimes outweighed any disorders he may have. During the second day of testimony in the trial's penalty phase, prosecutors presented audio recordings between Worley's sister and a private investigator. She mentioned that Worley had been suspected of killing a prostitute in 2000 (but was never charged as no remains could be found), as well as another woman in the 1970s that Worley described as \\"the love of his life\\", but who was not identified and might have still been alive at the time of the interview. Prior to sentencing, Worley made a 45-minute statement described by The Blade as \\"rambling and disjointed\\", in which he stated he believed someone else kidnapped and murdered Joughin, leaving evidence to frame him. Members of the gallery became upset during the statement and left the courtroom after he described Joughin as a \\"beautiful girl\\". The jury recommended capital punishment, which Judge Robinson upheld on April 16, 2018, stating, \\"If I thought there was a snowball's chance in hell that you were innocent, you'd be looking at [a] life [sentence]\\". Additionally, Worley was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for kidnapping, 8 years for felonious assault, 11 months for possession of criminal tools, and 36 months each for tampering with evidence and having weapons under disability. Since April 19, 2018, Worley has been held on death row at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution as inmate #A743593. His execution date, originally set for June 3, 2019, was delayed in June 2018, and again in August 2018 due to appeals. In July 2020, Worley's attorneys filed a motion with the Ohio Supreme Court to overturn his original conviction and grant him a new trial, citing the government's alleged failure to prove several aspects of the charges, Worley's mental illnesses, incompetent counsel, and several alleged violations of jury and evidentiary rules. == Aftermath == The funeral for Joughin was held on July 28, 2016 at Christ the Word church in Sylvania, Ohio, and her remains were interred in Amboy Township Cemetery in Delta, Ohio. === Community events === Following the arrest of Worley, community residents organized a \\"Take Back the Roads\\" memorial walk in honor of Joughin, taking place along the road her bicycle was found. On October 2, 2016, Evergreen School District hosted a \\"Joggin' 4 Joughin\\" 5K run to raise money for the Sierah Joughin Memorial Scholarship Fund, and to ask for support for a violent offender registry bill being constructed by Ohio legislators. Event officials expected to attract around 300 participants, but were forced to limit the number to 1600 when a large crowd of supporters and participants arrived. The memorial plaque and tree for Joughin at Evergreen High School, dedicated in 2019 === Sierah Joughin Memorial Scholarship Fund === During the disappearance and search, Joughin's family created a GoFundMe page to request funds to aid in the search effort. After her body was discovered, the family established the Sierah Joughin Memorial Scholarship Fund from the donations, in addition to the funds raised by the school district's 5K run event, to be administered by the Toledo Community Foundation. The scholarship benefits graduates from Evergreen High School (where Joughin graduated), who have participated in a varsity sport and organization. In September 2019, the high school dedicated a plaque and planted two trees on the property honoring Joughin. === Worley property === In July 2018, Worley's Delta, Ohio property was awarded to Joughin's estate, and her family had the main barn demolished. A monetary settlement of $3.6 million was also reached, but Joughin's family agreed not to execute on the judgement unless \\"the defendant(s) receives a windfall sum of money such as winning the lottery, or receiving book or movie rights or royalties...\\" In August 2020, the Fulton County Sherrif's Department searched the Worley property again, using excavation equipment, with assistance from the FBI. A statement by the sheriff read that the investigation into Worley was ongoing, that any evidence found would be collected with assistance from the FBI Evidence Response Team, and gave no further comment. Joughin's family stated that the search was not related to her case. === Sierah's Law === After the murder and trial, Joughin's family and other activists argued that not enough information was available to law enforcement and residents regarding convicted felons residing in their communities, and if a system had been in place to warn the public of offenders in their area, her murder might have been avoided. Law enforcement had stated to the family during the investigation that Worley was not on any local, state or federal database that tracks offenders, and the family argued that such a database being available might have resulted in Joughin being rescued alive. In July 2016, the organization 'Standing Courageous' started a Change.org petition, calling for lawmakers to establish a \\"violent offender registry\\" in Ohio, gathering over 13,000 signatures. Legislative efforts were made to create a database of violent offenders convicted of specific crimes such as murder, kidnapping and abduction. Initially introduced as Senate Bill 67, \\"Sierah's Law\\" was constructed in February 2017 by Senators Randy Gardner and Cliff Hite and presented to the Ohio Senate Judiciary Committee. Originally, the bill was intended to allow the public to search on a website for offenders with the qualifying convictions, similar to a sex offender registry. After several hearings, where some opponents such as the ACLU argued that the bill did nothing to protect the public and created privacy concerns, the bill was changed so that residents must visit their local sheriff's office to request a search be performed. In November 2017, \\"Sierah's Law\\" was introduced to the Ohio Senate as Senate Bill 231. Joughin's mother spoke before legislators in November 2018, urging them to pass the bill. It was passed on December 6, 2018, and signed into law by Governor John Kasich on December 19. It went into effect on March 20, 2019. === Charitable organizations === A non-profit charitable organization, Justice For Sierah, was established after the trial by Joughin's mother and aunt, which provides self-defense training courses for schools and communities, and educates the public on community safety topics and Sierah's Law. The organization holds an annual \\"Spirit of Sierah\\" 5K race in Sylvania, Ohio. A partner organization, KOGS (Keeping Our Girls Safe), was also started by Joughin's boyfriend, which offers self defense classes for women and holds an annual group motorcycle ride in her memory. == In media == The investigation and trial have appeared in television series: * Buried In the Backyard (Season 2, Episode 10; \\"Deep In The Cornfields\\") on Oxygen * The Long Way Home (Season 1, Episode 1; \\"Living a Nightmare\\") on Investigation Discovery ==See also== *List of solved missing person cases == References == == External links == *Ohio Senate Bill 231 Text (Ohio Legislature, 133rd General Assembly) * Justice For Sierah Website (Non-Profit Organization) Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2016 in Ohio Category:2016 murders in the United States Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Female murder victims Category:Formerly missing people found dead Category:July 2016 crimes in the United States Category:Missing person cases in Ohio Category:Murder in Ohio Category:People murdered in Ohio ","title":"Murder of Sierah Joughin"},{"id":"60362725","text":"Zayatulak and Hyuhylu–§. –ù–∞–¥—Ä—à–∏–Ω–∞. –û–± —ç–ø–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏–∏.

He attended United States Military Academy and graduated first in the class of 1888. ==Military service== Three years after graduating from USMA, Jervey graduated from the Army Engineering School of Application. Following that, he worked in various civil engineering roles with the US Army Corps of Engineers, improving the Mississippi River from 1898 to 1899, and managing rivers and harbors on the west coast of Florida from 1899 to 1900. From 1901 to 1903, Jervey served in the Philippines during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War in an undocumented capacity. Afterwards, he was an instructor at USMA from 1903 to 1905. Jervey returned to engineering work in 1905, managing rivers, harbors, and defenses of the Mobile District.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1975. P. 288 In 1910 he was assigned to river duty in Cincinnati. He returned to instruction in 1915, serving as an instructor at the Army War College. In 1917 he was promoted to Brigadier general and assigned to the 66th Field Artillery Brigade, a unit in the 41st Infantry Division (United States). Shortly after, he assumed command of the entire division from September 20, 1917 to January 8, 1918. Following that, he did a brief stint as the commandant of U.S. Army Engineer School (the former Army Engineering School of Application). In February 1918, he was moved to the War Department General Staff where he was made Director of Operations (G-3). This led to his promotion to Major general in October 1918. He was decorated with the Distinguished Service Medal for his service as Director of Operations. Following the end of the war in November 1918, he was reverted to his previous rank of Brigadier general and assumed command of the 11th Field Artillery Brigade in Hawaii. Jervey retired on April 10, 1922. During his service, he wrote one book, Warfare of the Future, which was published in 1917, prior to the outbreak of World War I and his promotion to Brigadier general. In it, he states that the US would not be likely to send expeditionary forces to another country if drawn into a conflict with a \\"first-rate\\" power, a prediction that would be proven false only a few months later.Jervey, Henry.

RIST Simple Profile was published in October 2018 and includes the following features: * The base stream uses RTP for compatibility with existing equipment. * Retransmission requests use RTCP. Two types of retransmission requests are defined: ** A Bitmask NACK, defined in RFC 4585. ** A Range NACK, defined as an APP RTCP packet. *Bonding of multiple links for load sharing. * Seamless switching using SMTPE-2022-7. *Out-of-band transmission of protection data. The RIST AG is working on an update to RIST Simple Profile that adds link probing to allow for dynamic ARQ protection. RIST Main Profile was published in March 2020 and adds the following features to Simple Profile: * Tunneling based on RFC 8086, with bidirectional send/receive in the same tunnel. *Multiplexing of multiple streams into the same tunnel. *In-band data support in the tunnel, useful for remote management. *Client/Server architecture. *Firewall traversal. *DTLS encryption. * Pre-Shared Key encryption, with multicast support, access control, and authentication. *Advanced authentication options using either public key certificates or TLS-SRP. * Bandwidth optimization based on NULL packet deletion. * Support for high bit-rate streams by extending the RTP sequence number.

This increases steam generation rate.Velox Boiler Slides Uploaded by Parth Shah Slide 2 Flue gases are used to turn turbine which is connected to the compressor. It increases the flow of hot air to speed of sound. This increases the rate of heat transfer to the water coming from economizer into evaporating section causing it to generate more steam that goes in superheater via steam separator. Steam from superheater is at high temperature and pressure. This is used to operate turbines. === Components === * Water feed pump * Economizer for water preheating * Hot water circulating pump * Tube evaporating section * Turbine * Compressor * Steam separator * Superheater ==Uses== Velox boiler was primarily marketed for electricity generation. They were anticipated to be used in steam locomotives on land as well as on sea but eventually lost to efficiency and cost effectiveness of supercharged diesel engine and constant pressure combustion gas turbine. Advantages of somewhat reduced weight and purely rotary motion were greatly offset by the fact that Velox boilers were little over half efficient compared to diesel engines.Discussion on the First Gas Turbine Locomotive (by A.

Although Alamo-Costello's work has included drawings, painting and journals, his artistic practice primarily lies in two areas: art-related public interventions, performances and social experiments that may be site-specific or placed in public space;Camper, Fred. \\"Lots of Meaning,\\" The Reader, September 16, 1994, p. 30‚Äì1. and photographic series in which he often takes on the role of archivist or journalist, collecting and documenting everyday, contemporary experiences and encounters. === Public and ephemeral art and social experiments === Alamo-Costello has worked on a range of public, temporary and experimental projects that present artwork in non-traditional settings to \\"non-art\\" audiences and explore themes of ephemerality, randomness, communication, and trust.Baran-Unland, Denise. \\"Art in the park,\\" The Herald News, December 19, 1999, p. E1, E6. His first forays into this work came about as a founding member of \\"Armpit\\" (1992‚Äì8), a performance and public art group that included himself and artists Jesse Bercowetz, Nick Nuccio and Michael Plaza. Between 1993‚Äì5, they embarked on three \\"art walks\\"‚Äîthe longest, a 298-mile Chicago-to-St. Louis trip‚Äîwheeling carts of their own sculpture as a \\"roving street gallery\\" bringing contemporary art to communities and viewers that normally have little contact with it in their own environments.Bibbs, Rebecca. \\"Exhibit Art...Walking,\\" The Indianapolis News, May 30, 1993, p. 13. In 1994, they created a temporary display of large \\"urban drop-offs\\" or \\"urban totems\\" in empty Chicago city lots that they made from refuse (cinder blocks, hunks of concrete, scrap wood, tubes and old tires) found on-site. The Chicago Reader's Fred Camper described it as a \\"guerrilla installation\\" of \\"near-chaotic accretions\\" that \\"gains much from its relationship to the site, and from the social goals that made the group choose it.\\" ==== \\"Art Drop\\" series ==== Alamo-Costello extended the urban drop-off concept with his \\"art drop\\" series (1998‚Äì ), an art-based social experiment that sought to break through the inaccessibility of art galleries and markets by introducing artworks in unexpected public places, thus involving a broader base of viewers in responding to and collecting art.McNichols, Kate. \\"Art in the park,\\" The Encounter, Joliet, IL, November 1, 2002, p. 11. For the first drop, \\"Searching for Geomantricks\\" (1998), Alamo- Costello created sixty 4\\" x 5\\" lightboxes with abstract color images inlaid in glass and encased in stained oak frames, which he placed in 20 Chicago public parks for passersby to find, keep and respond to; each was accompanied by a note describing the piece and project, a pen, and a self-addressed, stamped envelope for responding. The images, which resembled spider-like lairs, doubled as \\"puzzle\\" pieces that combined to form a large-scale image called Geomantrick's Blessing, which Alamo-Costello created by shooting sections of a string composition with a large format camera, varying exposure times, focus points and color balance.Weiss, Andrea. \\"Searching for Geomantrick\\", Public Art Review, Vol. 11, No. 2, Fall/Winter 1999, p. 43. Between 1999‚Äì2004, he produced \\"Appleseed International\\"‚Äînamed for the American folk-hero, Johnny Appleseed‚Äîin which he distributed 280 similarly conceived works to 20 U.S. and 20 international city parks.Weiss, Andrea. \\"Appleseed\\", Public Art Review, Vol. 12, No. 1, Fall/Winter 2000, p. 52. For New Street Agenda (2005-2013), he created 280 framed graffiti-like prints that comment on contemporary modes of deceptive communication and distributed them in 80 international cities from St. Petersburg, Russia through Europe to the United States. Alamo-Costello has received responses from about 30% of the left pieces, from places as widespread as Edinburgh and Paris to Joliet, Illinois. In 2000, Alamo-Costello produced ‚ÄúThe Men Who Sold The World‚Äù with Scottish artist Donald McGhie, an interactive exhibition and performance at the Hyde Park Art Center that explored contemporary \\"savage\\" capitalism and aggressive marketing techniques in the guise of a \\"fly-by-night upstart company\\" willing to buy or sell anything. The show transformed the center into \\"an enterprise zone\\" including modern office cubicles, product displays, flashing lights, and money-themed imagery; performative elements‚Äîat the opening and a second performance‚Äîincluded aggressive entrepreneurs offering to buy ideas, telemarketing of cellphone users from across the room, a liquidation auction down to the walls, and a money giveaway in the street. Chester Alamo-Costello, \\"Chelsea 1 ‚Äì Barcelona 1, 2nd Leg\\" (two images), photographs, UEFA Champions League Semi Final, May 5, 2009. From The Globe, 2010. === Documentary photographic practice === Alamo-Costello has created distinct photographic series since 1993, produced throughout the Midwest and Europe, using an approach informed by art and documentary photographers such as Barbara Crane, Mitch Epstein, Walker Evans, Susan Meiselas, Daid≈ç Moriyama, and August Sander. These series include \\"Chicago Portraits\\" (1993- ), depicting Chicago creatives, passersby, and neighborhoods; \\"7 Minutes SW of the Loop\\" (1996-2012), portraits and neighborhood studies of Chicago's near south side; \\"Street Notes\\" (1993- ), images of ephemeral street art, messages and signage; and \\"University\\" (2002- ), images taken at USF. Additional series have formed the basis of his three books. Chester Alamo-Costello, Chicago Street, Vicinity of Damen Ave. and North Ave., photograph, Chicago, IL, 2012. From Somewhere In-Between Chicago, 2018. Alamo-Costello's first sustained photographic subject was his grandfather, Danny Uberto, who he memorialized in his first book, Grandpa Danny (2008). The book combines sections compiling family mementos and snapshots, catalogued personal artifacts, and photos taken by Alamo-Costello; it was described as straddling the genres of fine arts monograph and personal visual tribute documenting a century of everyday life. His second book, The Globe (2010), also took on a personal subject: football (soccer) fan support at The Globe, a pub in Chicago‚Äôs Northcenter neighborhood that Alamo-Costello frequented and documented over five years.Garcia, Martin. \\"The Globe: A Photobook of Soccer Fandom,\\" Gapers Block, May 10, 2010.Guth, Amy, \\"The Globe,\\" Chicago Tribune, June 5, 2010. The book was noted for its emotional universality, capturing in unpolished, snapshot-like compositions of \\"unusual rawness and immediacy,\\" the interactions of fans, clubs, and televised contests. Somewhere In-Between Chicago (2018) documents people (artists, musicians, commuters, passersby), places, architecture and experiences Alamo-Costello encountered in Chicago over a 25-year period‚Äîmany compiled through over 170 artist/musician interviews and portraits‚Äîalong with essays from four writers mirroring the city's diversity and energy. == Publishing and writing == Alamo-Costello launched The COMP Magazine, a digital publication focusing on art and design, in 2014 with Egzon Shaqiri.

She is currently a federal deputy for the Democratic Labor Party (PDT) representing the state of S√£o Paulo. Throughout 2019, she was a vice-leader of the PDT and its associated political coalition. As an activist for education in Brazil, Amaral co-founded two organisations: Vontade de Aprender Ol√≠mpica, which prepares Brazilian students to compete in international olympiads, and Movimento Mapa Educa√ß√£o, which promotes education equality in Brazil.Fabio Takahashi, Tr√™s jovens criam movimento por educa√ß√£o de qualidade e protagonismo, Folha de S. Paulo, 7 November 2017 She also co- founded the political organisation Acredito, which provides funding for progressive candidates running for the first time in Brazil.Grupo de jovens lan√ßa o 'Acredito', um 'MBL progressista', Folha de S. Paulo, 28 March 2017 Before attending university, Amaral represented Brazil in five international science competitions. She then graduated from Harvard University, with a degree in astrophysics and political science. She was also a columnist for R√°dio CBN and Glamour magazine. == Early life == Tabata Amaral de Pontes is the daughter of Maria Renilda Amaral Pires, a domestic worker, and Olionaldo Francisco de Pontes, a bus conductor. She has a younger brother, Allan. They were raised in Vila Mission√°ria (Pt), a poor neighborhood located in the South Zone of S√£o Paulo, on the outskirts of the city.'Tabata Amaral: a mudan√ßa pela educa√ß√£o, Portal Dialogando, 21 July 2018 Tabata Amaral received her primary education in local public schools. In the sixth grade, at the age of 12, Amaral participated in the 2005 edition of the Brazilian Public School Mathematics Olympiad (OBMEP), and won a silver medal on her first attempt. The following year, due to her gold medal and strong academic performance, she obtained a full scholarship at Col√©gio ETAPA, a private school in S√£o Paulo, where she completed her secondary education. In the following years, she represented Brazil in international chemistry, astronomy and astrophysics Olympiads.Vanessa Fajardo, 'Supercampe√£ ol√≠mpica', jovem de SP quer estudar astrof√≠sica em Harvard, Portal G1, 4 November 2011 In 2012, Amaral was offered a full scholarship to a number prestigious universities, six of them in the United States: Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania and California Institute of Technology, and at the University of S√£o Paulo.Vanessa Fajardo, 'Supercampe√£' entra em Harvard e em mais 5 universidades americanas, Portal G1, 1 April 2012Aluna da rede p√∫blica √© aprovada em seis universidades americanas, Bom Dia Brasil TV Globo, 10 April 2012 === Academic life === Amaral attended Harvard University, graduating magna cum laude with highest honors in Government and Astrophysics. In her undergraduate senior thesis,Tabata Amaral de Pontes, The Politics of Education Reform in Brazilian Municipalities, Harvard University, March 2016 Amaral conducted an analysis of educational reforms in Brazilian municipalities, arguing that despite the expansion of access to education in Brazil over the past two decades, the quality of federal education remains lacking according to international standards.Paulo Saldan√£ e Natalia Cancian, Estagnado, Brasil fica entre os piores do mundo em avalia√ß√£o de educa√ß√£o, Folha de S. Paulo, 6 December 2016Ana Carolina Moreno, Brasil cai em ranking mundial de educa√ß√£o em ci√™ncias, leitura e matem√°tica, Portal G1, 6 December 2016 Her thesis received the Kenneth Maxwell Senior Thesis Prize in Brazilian studies, and the Eric Firth Prize for the best essay on the theme of democratic ideals. ==Activism== After graduating, Amaral returned to Brazil to work as an education activist.Tabata Amaral: A dona do sonho gigante para mudar a educa√ß√£o no Brasil, Huff Post Brasil, 1 April 2018Mariana Bonora, 'Voltei para lutar por uma educa√ß√£o de qualidade no Brasil', diz jovem formada em Harvard, Portal G1, 20 May 2018 In 2014, Amaral co-founded the education advocacy organisation Movimento Mapa Educa√ß√£o (the Education Map Movement) with L√≠gia Stocche and Renan Ferreirinha (Pt). The organisation crowd-sourced concerns about education among young people in Brazil, and then questioned candidates on those education-related issues during the 2016 Brazilian municipal elections, disseminating their responses widely on social media. In 2017, Amaral co-founded the organisation Acredito (meaning \\"I believe\\") with Felipe Ori√° and Jos√© Frederico Lyra Netto. The organisation promotes young progressive politicians who are seeking office for the first time, with a particular focus on increasing the diversity of federal deputies. ==Political career== ===2018 election=== During the 2018 general election, Amaral's campaign was mainly centered on education. She received the sixth highest vote total of any candidate in the state of S√£o Paulo, with 264,450 votes. She is a member of the Democratic Labor Party (PDT). ===Deputy=== Building on her background as an education activist, Amaral became a prominent education critic, and was credited with being partly responsible for the removal of Ricardo V√©lez Rodr√≠guez as the Minister of Education in the government of Jair Bolsonaro. She served on the Education Commission, the Commission for the Defense of Women's Rights, and as an alternate member of the Science and Technology, Communication and Informatics Commission. From February 20, 2019 until April 25, 2019, she was the vice-leader of the PDT Block, the electoral coalition of the PDT. From June until November of that year, she was the vice- leader of the PDT. Amaral voted for reforming the Brazilian security system, which would raise the retirement age; this was a major policy of Jair Bolsonaro's government, and the PDT opposed the reform. Amaral broke party lines together with 8 other deputies of the PDT to vote in favour of the reform, stating that the reforms would be beneficial for education in Brazil. For this she was temporarily suspended from the party. == Controversies == In July 2019, the magazines Veja and Exame revealed that Amaral hired her boyfriend, Daniel Alejandro Mart√≠nez, to work on her 2018 election campaign. According to the Superior Electoral Court, Amaral spent 23,000 reais (at the time about 6,000 USD) from the public election fund to pay for these services, which were provided between August and October of 2018. Amaral's team did not present the results of the services provided by Mart√≠nez. In another case, the Supreme Federal Court had previously ruled that hiring relatives or spouses with electoral funds is legal, but the practice has been widely condemned by journalists and commentators. Veja magazine asserted that it was hypocritical for Amaral to engage in this practice, since in a previous interview with the magazine she had taken the anti-corruption position that \\"renewal in politics is not about changing the name of things or the face in power, but a change of practices\\". ==Selected honours== *BBC 100 inspiring and influential women (2019) *Time 100 Next (2019) ==References== Category:Democratic Labour Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Women political scientists Category:Brazilian political scientists Category:Brazilian activists Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from S√£o Paulo Category:21st-century Brazilian politicians Category:21st-century Brazilian women politicians Category:BBC 100 Women ","title":"Tabata Amaral"},{"id":"60363220","text":"Ellie Robinson may refer to: * Ellie Robinson (swimmer) (born 2001), English Paralympic swimmer ","title":"Ellie Robinson"},{"id":"60363257","text":"Fire of Love is a 1981 album by American punk band the Gun Club.

It has a medium to low glass transition temperature of -3 ¬∞C. Chemically, it is a mixture of isomeric vinyl esters of neodecanoic acid. == Uses == Vinyl neodecanoate is mainly used as a modifying monomer in conjunction with other monomers and particularly the manufacture of vinyl acetate based polymer emulsions by the process of emulsion polymerization. Vinyl neodecanoate-containing polymers are used in decorative emulsion paints, plasters and renders especially in Europe. Vinyl neodecanoate, like most vinyl ester monomers, is very hydrophobic and the structure is highly branched with a tertiary substituted Œ±-carbon. It is used as a hydrophobic co-monomer. This structure renders the polymers produced from it, very resistant to alkali degradation as there is no hydrogen (thus proton producing species) on the Œ±-carbon. They have good resistance to degradation from ultraviolet light. The monomer has even been used to produce vibration dampening resins. == See also == * Vinyl acetate * Acrylate polymer == References == == External links == * Safety Data Sheet Category:Monomers Category:Vinyl compounds ","title":"Vinyl neodecanoate"},{"id":"60363333","text":"Bellino is a surname.

His father was William Drummond Watson (1846‚Äì1921) a tenant farmer, and his mother was Annie Neill (1852‚Äì1927). In 1881 his family had moved to Ochiltree. He was educated at Ayr Academy and was school dux. He studied Medicine at Glasgow University graduating MB ChB in 1911 and gaining his doctorate (MD) in 1913. He then took the unusual role as Medical Officer of Peterhead Prison from 1913. In this capacity, he volunteered in February 1914 to force-feed Ethel Moorhead on hunger strike at Calton Jail in Edinburgh. Ethel was later released into the care of Dr Grace Cadell, a rare (and sympathetic) female physician who had a sanctuary for suffragettes on Leith Walk. Later in 1914 he was the official physician at the force-feeding of four female prisoners held at Perth Prison and subject to the new Cat and Mouse Act aimed to stem the suffragettes going on hunger strike. In this capacity he crossed swords with Arabella Scott, breaking her front teeth in the act of forcing the metal feed tube into her mouth.Scotsman newspaper 2 October 2019 The other suffragettes so appallingly treated were Mary Richardson, Frances Gordon, Maude Edwards and Fanny Parker. The method was changed from force-feeding to nutrient-rich suppositories, but if anything, this increased public outrage. Watson stayed on at Perth Prison until 1920, when he was appointed Medical Deputy Commissioner to the General Board of Control for Scotland. In 1923 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Andrew Freeland Fergus, Sir Robert Muir, Frederick Orpen Bower, and Thomas Hastie Bryce. He died at the City hospital in Edinburgh on 16 June 1946, but was buried with family members in Mauchline Cemetery in Ayrshire. ==Family== In December 1916 he married Donella Anne Aitkens of Earls Court at St Cuthberts Church at Philbeach Gardens in London. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Renfrewshire Category:People educated at Ayr Academy Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:20th-century Scottish medical doctors Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Force-feeding ","title":"Hugh Ferguson Watson"},{"id":"60363513","text":"Drury Melone (1833-1903) was a California politician who served as the 11th California Secretary of State and a Presidential Elector.

Rodriguez's community activities and movements of the time including the Young Lords, Black Panthers, and the civil rights movement influenced her political and social justice awareness throughout her career. In 1974 she graduated from Seward Park High School. From 1976 to 1978 Rodriguez studied dance at the Pratt Institute before going on to receive her Bachelor of Science degree from New York University in 1982. While at NYU, she researched the sterilization of and the pharmaceutical companies' birth control experimentation on Puerto Rican women after hearing some of their stories growing up. This was her first exposure to population control and impacted her later reproductive rights activism. She earned a Master of Science in Nonprofit Leadership from Fordham University. In 1996, she became the director of the Latina Roundtable on Health and Reproductive Rights. From 1997-98, Rodriguez lead a series of meetings focusing on reproductive-tract infections among women of color with the Ford Foundation.

It is a Marian shrine on the old pilgrim's route to the now demolished Knaresborough Abbey and close to the ancient stone quarry that was used for building works at Knaresborough Castle, the parish church and elsewhere. It was also once known as Quarry Chapel or Our Lady of the Quarry. ==Cave and access== The exterior of the chapel site The chapel, dedicated to St Mary, is a Grade I Listed Building that is reached via a narrow path and steps from Abbey Road.St Mary's, Knaresborough The Chapel has a carved altar with a canopied niche, gargoyles, a vaulted ceiling, roof bosses, pillars with floriate capitals, a Celtic head, a piscina and externally a large carving of a medieval knight guards the entrance. The vaulted ceiling is similar to that of Wallace's Cave at Auchinleck in Ayrshire. The figure of the knight may be contemporary with the chapel, although Historic England date it to between 1695 and 1739. It was certainly present in 1814 when it was mentioned by William Wordsworth. The head is separate from the body and may have been recarved in the Victorian times.Yorkshire Guide In 1907 the OS map shows a path running from the chapel to the nearby 'House in the Rock'. The steps cut into the sandstone are still present but very worn.Yorkshire CLIV.12, Revised: 1907, Published: 1909 This map records the site erroneously as 'St Roberts Chapel'. ==History== Madonna and child statue inside the chapel This Oratory Chapel, a place for prayer, was built possibly by a master mason, known as 'John the Mason' or 'John Mason', in 1408 or 1409.Historic England The chapel was a recorded in a charter of King Henry IVChapel of Our Lady of the Crag \\"John Mason received from the lord a piece of waste land below the quarry with licence to excavate there beneath the quarry in order to make and hold a chapel; which he and his assigns are to have and to hold for the term of their life for an annual rent.\\" Various versions of the legend of its creation exist, one of which is that John the Mason was working in the nearby quarry when he saw that a rock fall was about to engulf and kill his son, unable to reach him in time he prayed to the Virgin Mary and miraculously the stones changed direction and his son was saved. John pledged to create a chapel as thanks for the miracle. It ceased to function as a chapel following Henry VIII's Reformation, however in 1916 it was reconsecrated as a Roman Catholic place of worship after becoming the property of Ampleforth Abbey. Three carved heads located on the right-hand wall were taken away at this time. A new statue of our Lady of the Crag was provided for the Chapel.Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag - Modern Times The chapel has had several mentions by travellers over the years and was visited by pilgrims between the 16th and 17th centuries. It has often been confused with the Holy Cross Chapel and cave of St Robert of Knaresborough that lie further down the River Nidd. The crag has been the site of many rough dwellings over the centuries, such as simple shanty dwellings as evidenced by the many post holes cut into the sandstone of the cliff. The chapel cave's use is not recorded however by the end of the Victorian era the basic lean to dwellings had been cleared away. In 2019, the chapel was the subject of vandalism, with the glass in the medieval window frames smashed. However, the glass itself is not medieval as some media reports suggested. Public donations covered the cost and demonstrated that the chapel means a great deal to the local community. ===Restoration=== The windows have been conserved and figure of the medieval knight restored, internally a modern statue of Madonna and Child has been sculpted and was placed in the shrine in 2000. Since 2017 the site has been in the care of the Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag Trust. The 1919 statue of 'Our Lady of the Crag' now stands in the grounds of St Mary's Catholic church. ==See also== *Cleeves Cove *Dunton Cove *The Holy Cave, Hunterston *Peden's Cave (Auchinbay) *St Robert's Cave and Chapel of the Holy Cross ==References== ;Notes ==External links== * Video footage of the Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag.

Al-Bazdawi‚Äôs Kitab Usul al-Din, as it was described by Hans- Peter Linss, could be classified in: # Firstly, a short review of all literature of the heretics on dogma and theology in Islam. # Secondly, Hanafi- Sunni orthodoxy defense against the dissenting opinions and teachings of the heretical sects. # Finally, a study on the heterodox factions in Islam, their subdivisions and their most important heads. He is also author of Ma'rifat al- Hujaj al-Shar'iyya () in Usul al-Fiqh. Dr. Haytham Abdul-Hamid Khazna () said in his book Tatawur al-Fikr al-Usuli al-Hanafi () that this book should not be attributed to Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi, because the books of Tarajim (biographies and bibliographies) didn't mention it, and because the book is weak in style analysis. == Death == After serving for a period of time as a magistrate in Samarqand, he eventually moved to Bukhara and died there in 493 A.H.

It was built in 1865 and is a Grade II* listed building. == History and features == Mosaics of the four archangels on the east wall in the chancel The church was begun in 1865 due to the overcrowding of the parish church of St Denys, and was completed in the same year. The site is about southeast of the town centre, in a field called Picked Acre alongside Boreham Road, which had been given by William Temple of Bishopstrow House in 1859. The Rev J. E. Phillips, vicar of St Denys', opened a building fund which in less than one year raised ¬£2,700, an amount greater than the building's eventual cost of ¬£1,935. The church was designed by London architect George Edmund Street in 1864‚Äì1865, in Early English style. Given the relatively ordinary- looking exterior, the interior is quite unexpected. The tiling throughout, reredos, low chancel screen wall, font, pulpit, oak choir stalls and free- standing nave benches were completed before 1868. The reredos has a gabled centre with Crucifixion. The stained glass in the chancel was made by Clayton and Bell. The bellcote over the east end of the nave has one bell. The mosaics and opus sectile murals of scriptural scenes on the wall were designed by Charles Ponting and painted by James Powell and Sons in 1911‚Äì1915. These striking turn-of-the-century images are matched by the mosaics of the four archangels on the east wall in the chancel, behind the reredos. A western baptistery was added by Ponting in 1925‚Äì1926. The church was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1978. == Parish == St John's was built as a chapel-of-ease for St Denys' church. In 1956 the area around St John's was added to Bishopstrow parish, and that parish was renamed Bishopstrow and Boreham. A group ministry was established in 1974 to cover this parish, Upton Scudamore and the Warminster churches of St Denys and Christ Church; this continues today as the River Were benefice, although Christ Church is now separate. == References == ==External links== * A Church Near You entry * Warminster Warminster Warminster Category:Churches completed in 1865 Category:G.

Ga produces narratives in the form of video installations, performances and artist‚Äôs books. She received an MFA from the Hunter College in New York, NY and a BA from Marymount Manhattan College, NY. Ga is represented by Bureau, New York. She lives and works in Stockholm, Sweden. == Work == Introducing Ga's work in a 2018 interview, Anna Della Subin writes: \\"Ellie Ga is an artist of the intrepid. Charting a course from Patagonia to the North Pole, she voyages through histories, mythologies and languages, navigating the role of the artist on a precarious planet. Her points of latitude are chance meetings, accidents and coincidences.\\" Ga‚Äôs writing is closely tied to her performative practice. In an essay on Ellie Ga's work, Lauren O'Neill-Butler writes, \\"her lyrical essays‚Äîher voiceovers and written texts‚Äîare as equally concerned with humans as they are with the lives, histories, and migrations of objects, particularly the lost meaning of symbols.\\" She is a founding editor of Ugly Duckling Presse. In 2018, she worked with Siglio Press to produce the book Square Octagon Circle. Max L. Feldman, in a 2018 Hyperallergic review of Square Octagon Circle, described her working process as similar to that of a \\"conceptual archaeologist.\\" Of the artist, critic Jennifer Kabat wrote for Frieze, \\"Ellie Ga‚Äôs essays ‚Äì which manifest as performances and installations ‚Äì guide you on expeditions to the Arctic or through Egypt searching for the first lighthouse.\\" Ga will be exhibiting in the 2019 edition of the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art. == Selected works == Gyres - 2019 (single channel video installation) Strophe, A Turning - 2017 (2 channel video installation) Eureka, A Lighthouse Play - 2015 (performance) Four Thousand Blocks - 2014 (3 channel video installation) Measuring the Circle - 2014 (video) The Fortunetellers - 2011 (performance) Reading the Deck of Tara - 2011 (performance) == Selected writings == Square Octagon Circle, Siglio Press, 2018 () North Was Here, Ugly Ducking Presse, 2018 () Dialogue (with Marcelline Delbecq), 2018 Shelter Press () Three Arctic Booklets, Ugly Duckling Presse (limited edition), June 7, 2010. Classification of A Spit Stain, Ugly Duckling Presse, February 15, 2009 (). == The Fortunetellers == From 2007 to 2009 Ga was a part of the Tara expedition drifting through the Arctic pack ice. Based on the expedition Ga produced a series of works called The Fortunetellers. Among the works in the series are the performances The Fortunetellers and Reading the Deck of Tara. The Tara is a sailboat designed to withstand the pressure of the polar ice cap. Stuck, with little ability to communicate with the outside world, the near constant darkness weighed upon the boat's passengers. Ga, in her account of their eventual release from the ice, describes seeing light for the first time: ‚ÄúAt that moment,\\" she writes in the Square Octagon Circle, \\"a lighthouse blinking in the distance became a symbol for our anxieties about the future: it marked our return to civilization.‚Äù The series included performances, installations and videos, and was shown at The New Museum in February 2013. Ga was selected to be a member of the Tara expedition based on her eighteen month residency at the New York Explorers Club where she began exploring incomplete paper trails and documentation related to historical explorations. == Square Octagon Circle == Square Octagon Circle is a 14-piece multimedia project and book. The purpose of the project is to determine what the Lighthouse of Alexandria looked like. The lighthouse is one of the lost seven wonders of the world. In 2011, Ga studied marine archeology at the University of Alexandria‚Äôs Centre for Maritime Archaeology and Underwater Cultural Heritage in Alexandria Egypt. This was the basis for a series of videos and performances about the submerged ruins of the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria, including the video installations Four Thousand Blocks and Measuring the Circle, and the performance Eureka, A Lighthouse Play produced by the Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) in 2014. A comprehensive exhibition of the works in Square Octagon Circle was shown at Le Grand Caf√©, Saint-Nazaire in 2015. == Strophe, A Turning == From 2014-2017 Ga was the recipient of a fellowship from the Swedish Research Council. Initially her research project was centered on ocean drift and more specifically the narratives and history of the message in a bottle. The project developed into the video installation Strophe, A Turning. In their presentation text of Strophe, A Turning for the 2018 edition of the Clandestino Festival, The Museum of World Culture in Gothenburg writes: \\"...her own willingness to drift and follow uncertain turns carries her unexpectedly to the Greek islands of Symi and Lesvos, during the summer of 2015. Ga decides to join a team of volunteers aiding asylum seekers and refugees‚Äîa definitive turning point at which she is forced to wrestle not only with the poetics of accidental drift and the new discoveries it beckons, but with urgent political and humanitarian realities.\\" == Gyres == Gyres, is a single channel video installation that premiered at the 2019 Whitney Biennial. The installation consists of Gyres 1-3, a triptych of short videos. Ga‚Äôs voice-over narrates as collected images are arranged and re-arranged on a light box surface, weaving together experiences of loss and grief, the transient nature and meaning of personal items displaced by disasters. Presenting Gyres 1-3, The Whitney Museum writes: \\"Ga‚Äôs narration interweaves seemingly disparate accounts and retellings, blending history, research, and autobiography. She encounters beachcombers who gather the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan; an oceanographer who studies the debris from container spills; and the histories of resistance, migration, and ritual offerings on the Greek islands of the Aegean Sea.\\" == Collections == Albright-Knox Art Gallery Fluentum Collection Fondation Galeries Lafayette FRAC Franche-Comt√© Hessel Museum of Art Solomon R.

Costa Rica is one of the few countries without armed forces and, alongside Panama, one of the few that is not a microstate. However, like Panama, Costa Rica does have limited military capacities with its Public Forces which have both police and defense functions and had taken part in military operations since 1949. Contrary to popular belief, the article does not really completely abolish the army, it only establishes that the army cannot be a permanent standing organization The article does establish that Costa Rica may create an army for national defense or for international cooperation, but also clarifies that it will always be submitted to civilian authority. The date of the abolition of the army is celebrated in Costa Rica as a national holiday. ==Text of the article== English translation according to the site CostaRicanLaw.com: ==Historical background== Cuartel Bellavista, today Museo Nacional de Costa Rica. Costa Rica's army was abolished soon after the end of the 1948 civil war by decision of the Constituent Assembly and the enactment of the Constitution on 31 October 1949. (Spanish) Costa Rica's Army headquarters, the Cuartel Bellavista in the capital San Jos√©, is transferred to the University of Costa Rica and is where currently Museo Nacional de Costa Rica is located. Although several figures have claim authorship of the idea, generally the victorious caudillo of the war Jos√© Figueres Ferrer is credited for its abolishing. Whilst some critics point his motivations more as an effort to avoid an impending coup (and indeed Costa Rica hasn't had a coup since 1949, something unusual for the region) others reasons have been signaled including the fact that the army at the time was made mostly of foreign mercenary of the Caribbean Legion or that it was obsolete and an unnecessary expend of resources that were redirected on education and healthcare. Despite this, Costa Ricans in general show pride for this event and the country has a very rooted pacifist and anti-militarist culture. ==Criticism== Criticism about the issue are split generally under two camps. On one side critics mostly on the left of the spectrum who question the effectiveness of the measure and consider that Costa Rica's abolishing of the army was in name only, and that for all effects Costa Rica still has a pseudo- military on the Public Forces, which are not only used for internal repression like any other army, but also get involve in both domestic and international US-lead military operations. The opposite criticism come mostly from far-right circles who question the decision of not having an army and advocate for its re-installment. ==References== Category:Military history of Costa Rica Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica Category:Pacifism ","title":"Article 12 of the Constitution of Costa Rica"},{"id":"60363963","text":"Fuyang () is a town under the administration of Tongjiang County, Sichuan, China. , it has one residential community and eight villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Sichuan Category:Tongjiang County ","title":"Fuyang, Sichuan"},{"id":"60363973","text":"Puerto Rico Highway 212 (PR-212) is a north‚Äìsouth bypass located south of downtown Isabela, Puerto Rico.

He was a son of Captain James Thomas (d. 1842) and his wife, a daughter of Captain John Callihan, a War of 1812 soldier. His parents were originally from Virginia and were among the early settlers, in 1807, of the region between the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. ==Career== After limited schooling in Marietta, he began his career as a junior clerk with the Keystone Iron Company in Jackson, Ohio where he learned the engineering of mining. ===U.S. Civil War=== An ardent Republican upon the forming of the party, Thomas enlisted during the U.S. Civil War as a Second Lieutenant in the 27th Ohio Infantry of the Union Army in July 1861. For three years, he served under Col. John W. Fuller in the \\"Ohio Brigade\\" and was successively promoted \\"for gallant and meritorious\\" to Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel before being brevetted a Brigadier general. Thomas mostly participated in the south and west under Grant and Sherman during the War, including at the Battles of Pittsburgh Landing, Chattanooga and Vicksburg. He was known for leading the first black Union troops, the 63rd and 64th United States Colored Infantry, into battle. Thomas was in the rear with the reserve forces during General Sherman's March to the Sea. For one year after the war during the Reconstruction era, he was in charge of the Freedman's and Abandoned Land and Property Departments in Mississippi. He was an Adjutant General on the staff of Oliver Otis Howard until January 1867 when he was honorably mustered out of the army. ===Later career=== After the war, he moved to Zanesville, Ohio and entered the industrial sector, first as a pig iron and railroad supplies manufacturer. In 1869, he moved into coal mining when the Hocking Valley coal mines opened, and eventually moved into railroads in 1878. He began constructing railroads in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Nebraska, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. From 1878 until March 1882, he variously served as vice president and president of the Creek Valley Railroad, a director and general manager of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (known as the Nickel Plate Road). Beginning in 1882, he served as the president of the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway Company and was a director of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway, and the Marquette, Houghton and Ontonagon Railroad, the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, and the Richmond and Danville Railroad, the latter two later became the Southern Railway. ==Personal life== In September 1872, Thomas was married to Ann Augusta Porter (1847‚Äì1944), a daughter of Carson Porter, a prominent citizen of Zanesville. Together, they were the parents of the following children: * Edward Russell Thomas (1873‚Äì1926), a banker and owner of the New York Morning Telegraph, who married three times, first to Linda Lee Thomas, then to Elizabeth Finley, and lastly, to actress Lucy Cotton. * Harold Edgell Thomas, a physician who married a widow, Ada Blande, to his father's dismay. * Eleanor Nancy Thomas (1878‚Äì1920), who married Robert Livingston Beeckman, the Governor of Rhode Island from 1915 to 1921. He was a member of the New York Yacht Club, the Riding Club, the Southern Club, the Union League Club, the Country Club, the Ohio Club, the Lotos Club, the Lawyers' Club and the Jekyl Island Club. Thomas died of heart disease at his home, 17 West 57th Street in New York City, on January 11, 1903. At his death, his estate was estimated to be $10,000,000 (equivalent to $ today). His executors (including George Macculloch Miller) were instructed to invest $100,000 (equivalent to $ today) and pay the income to his son Harold because in his will, Thomas stated: \\"I make no further provision for my son Harold because his condition, mentally and physically, is such that he is incapable of managing his own affairs.\\" Upon his widow's death in 1944, she left her estate to son Dr. Harold E. Thomas, and not to her late son Edward's children Samuel and Lucetta, \\"because, in my opinion, each of them is adequately provide for financially\\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1840 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Union Army generals ","title":"Samuel Russell Thomas"},{"id":"60364595","text":"Pulled string painting Pulled string painting is a painting method using pulled strings. == Notes == == References == * A Handbook of Arts and Crafts, Phillip R.

Current debate about the issue and the passing toward a full secular state are in the public and political debate. This article is also the only one in the Title VI, only chapter of the Constitution dealing with religion. ==Text of the article== English translation according to the site CostaRicanLaw.com: ==Controversy== Like other issues as same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, in vitro fertilization and abortion, church-state separation is an issue that often splits conservative and progressive voters in Costa Rica. Costa Rica like many Latin American countries has three main religious communities; Catholics (52%), Evangelical Christians (22%) and non- religious including agnostics and atheists (17%). Whilst Catholics are split on the issue, most non-religious citizens support the secular state whilst more Evangelical Christians oppose it (despite the fact that Evangelism is not the official religion and would not be affected for the measure), mostly because they see it as a gradual transition toward state atheism. The National Liberation Party, Citizens' Action Party and Broad Front support church-state separation whilst the Social Christian Republican Party, Costa Rican Renewal Party, National Restoration Party and New Republic Party oppose it. There is a constitutional reform bill under discussion in the Legislative Assembly in parliamentary committees, however as the Evangelical caucuses oppose it its advance have been null. ==Public opinion== In 2011, 41% of ticos were in favor of elimination article 75 of the Constitution according to a Unimer poll. A National University's survey of 2014 shown only 25% of support for such reform. A survey made by the University of Costa Rica in 2017 found same results; 25% of support. A sociological study made between 2013 and 2014 showed that most practicing Catholics support a secular state as they consider that the economical bond between church and state functions as a \\"gag\\" of the Church and support laicism, position also held by most non-practicing Catholics. Non-religious people vastly support laicism and argue that no church should receive state funding. Neo-Pentecostals on the other hand fiercely oppose laicism as the homologate secular state with state atheism and consider that the current status of confessional state also protects the Evangelical Churches. Historical protestants on the other hand tend to understand better the difference between laicism and atheism and some support the secular state, however a large number of this non-Neo-Pentecostal Protestants argue that all churches should receive state funding and that Costa Rica's official religion should be Christianity and not Catholicism in particular. Finally religious minorities like Muslims, Bah√° º√≠s, Zen, Tibetan and Nichiren Buddhists, Taoists, New Agers and Hindus vastly support the secular state and laicism, and consider that no religion should receive state funding. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Religion in Costa Rica Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ","title":"Article 75 of the Constitution of Costa Rica"},{"id":"60364656","text":"Jeremy Howe is the editor of long running radio drama The Archers for the BBC since 2018.

The new building should accommodate, in addition to the company's employees, equipment, training rooms and meetings, a live broadcast link antenna, an area for the board and a private restaurant. There was also a need for space for exhibitions and events, on the ground floor, and underground parking lots. == Architectural design == In order to meet the extensive program, solutions were adopted such as the development of an office modulation that followed the concept of open planning, with prestressed slabs to increase the spans, reducing to the maximum the number of internal pillars. The architect Jos√© Godoy, one of the authors of the architecture project, recalls that, in the thousand-square-meter floors, the requirement was to create indoor environments that received abundant natural light. Another condition of the project was the installation of a tower (antenna) of 80 meters for the reception and transmission of data and images of Globo TV. It should be implanted on the building with elegance, without, however, failing to meet the technical specifications. According to √Ålvaro Aguiar, equity manager of the company, the alternative was to execute it using the body of the building itself. In this way, two pillars contiguous to the building and an isolate form its support base. ==References== Category:Office buildings completed in 2006 Category:Rede Globo Category:Skyscrapers in S√£o Paulo Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Brazil ","title":"Jornalista Roberto Marinho Building"},{"id":"60364709","text":"Guse is a surname.

Carried by a storm, he arrived to the island but thinking it was Corcyra (Corfu), Telegonus began plundering the island because of hunger. Odysseus and his oldest son, Telemachus, defended their city and Telegonus accidentally killed his father with the spine of a stingray.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca Epitome of Book 4.7.36 By the instruction of Athena, he brought the body back to Aeaea and buried it there. Telegonus took Penelope, Odysseus' widow, and Telemachus, Odysseus' son, with him. Circe made them immortal and married Telemachus, while Telegonus made Penelope his wife.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca Epitome of Book 4.7.37 With Penelope, he was the father of Italus who called the country Italy from his own name. This is the story told in the Telegony, an early Greek epic that does not survive except in a summary, but which was attributed to Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene and written as a sequel to the Odyssey. Variants of the story are found in later poets: for example, in a tragedy by Sophocles, Odysseus Acanthoplex (which also does not survive), Odysseus finds out from an oracle that he is doomed to be killed by his son. He assumes that this means Telemachus, whom he promptly banishes to a nearby island. When Telegonus arrives on Ithaca, he approaches Odysseus' house, but the guards do not admit him to see his father; a commotion arises, and Odysseus, thinking it is Telemachus, rushes out and attacks. In the fighting, he is killed by Telegonus. In Italian and Roman mythology, Telegonus became known as the founder of Tusculum, a city just to the southeast of Rome, and sometimes also as the founder of Praeneste, a city in the same region (modern Palestrina).Plutarch, Parallela minora 41 Ancient Roman poets regularly used phrases such as \\"walls of Telegonus\\" (e.g. Propertius 2.32) or \\"Circaean walls\\" to refer to Tusculum. == Notes == == References == * Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae from The Myths of Hyginus translated and edited by Mary Grant.

He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford in 1717. He married Loveday Garrod, daughter of S. Garrod of Lincolnshire. In 1727, he succeeded his uncle William Leathes (resident at Brussels c.1718-24) and assumed name of Leathes 1727. ==Political career== Leathes‚Äô inheritance included an estate near Harwich, where he intended to stand at the 1727 British general election, but in the event was returned as Member of Parliament for Sudbury. In 1733 he was described as ‚Äòa friend to the Government, a sure one, and has not given a vote against us‚Äô. In 1733 Leathes applied to Walpole for the government interest at Harwich for the next election, and Walpole agreed that this should go to Leathes and Lord Perceval, standing jointly. At the 1734 British general election, Leathes said he could not persuade his supporters to go along with the compact, and he joined with Charles Stanhope, against Perceval. Leathes became Recorder of Harwich in 1734. At the 1741 British general election he nominated his brother, Hill Mussenden, to replace him at Harwich, and went back to Sudbury. He supported the Administration until the end of 1743, when he and his brother voted with the Opposition on a motion to discontinue the service of the Hanoverians from British pay. They abstained from both the two subsequent divisions on the Hanoverians in 1744 and 1746. He lost control of Harwich at the 1747 British general election when his brother was replaced there by a government nominee. ==Later life== Leathes never stood for election again, but continued to play a part in Harwich politics.

Admission was free to the general public, and the match between and was contested before a crowd of 53,034 ‚Äì which at that time was the record for a stand-alone women's sporting event in Australia. It was won by Adelaide, 10.3 (63) to 2.6 (18), and Adelaide claimed its second premiership in three years. Its co-captain Erin Phillips was voted best on ground, despite suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in the third quarter. ==Background== Two new teams, and , joined the AFL Women's (AFLW) competition in 2019, bringing the total number of teams to ten. The league retained a seven-round home-and-away season. This was achieved by splitting the competition into two conferences, with one of the new teams in each. Each team played four games against their fellow conference members and three \\"cross- over\\" matches against teams from the other conference. Conference membership was based on the final ladder positions of the 2018 season. As it turned out, the competition was unbalanced, with Conference A teams winning 14 of the 16 cross-over matches. The finals series was expanded to include preliminary finals for the first time. The two teams that finished the highest in each conference at the end of the home-and-away season qualified for the preliminary finals, with the team that finished highest in Conference A playing the team that finished second in Conference B and vice versa. The winners of these matches then played in the AFL Women's Grand Final. After winning the 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final, the Crows finished a disappointing fifth in 2018. The Blues, which were also expected to perform well in 2018, did much worse, ultimately battling for the wooden spoon ‚Äì and getting it. In 2019, both Adelaide and Carlton had new coaches ‚Äì Matthew Clarke and Daniel Harford respectively. The Crows retained much of their team from 2017 and 2018, but lacked a ruckman after Rhiannon Metcalfe was sidelined for an ACL reconstruction and Jasmyn Hewett suffered an ankle injury. Former Opals basketball player Jess Foley was pressed into the ruck role at the last minute. The Crows went on to an impressive season, notching up seven games by an average of 40 points, and finishing on top of Conference A. Their only loss for the season was by a single point in the first round match against the , when they kicked an inaccurate 1.11. Carlton got off to a slow start, losing to North Melbourne in round one and then Adelaide in round two, before winning five of the last six games to finish on top of Conference B. In their preliminary final, the Crows conducted a 66-point demolition of Geelong before a home crowd of 13,429 at the Adelaide Oval, not allowing the visitors to score until late in the final quarter. In an answer to critics of the women's game that complained about it being low scoring, the Crows outscored nine of the men's teams that weekend (including their own men's team, as well as reigning premiers ), despite the fact that AFLW only plays 15 minute quarters (instead of 20), and has less time on. The conference system ensured that Carlton, which finished at the top of Conference B, also hosted the preliminary finals. This was seen as disadvantaging Fremantle, which had won two more games than Carlton, and had a far better percentage (141.2 per cent compared with 99.6 per cent). In the lead up to the preliminary final, an image of Carlton's star forward Tayla Harris demonstrating her on-field athleticism that was posted online by the Seven Network came under attack by misogynist internet trolls. Rather than suppressing their comments, Seven took the image down, resulting in a chorus of outrage. In the preliminary final, Harris went on to demonstrate her kicking style, slotting Carlton's first goal from 45 metres out. The Blues went on to win by 36 points, setting up a grand final clash with Adelaide. ==Venue== As the minor premiers, Adelaide won the right to host the grand final. The match was scheduled for Sunday, 31 March 2019 at Adelaide Oval, which AFLW Chief Executive Nicole Livingstone conceding this timeslot would clash with a men's game between and the . The AFLW considered a Saturday game, but getting the ground ready for a game later that afternoon meant that the Grand Final would have to start at 10:30 am (Adelaide time) to have the signage and advertising changed for the men's game, a proposition that was rejected outright by the clubs and Adelaide Oval management. Admission was free to the general public, and the AFL hoped for a crowd of around 25,000. In the event, the crowd of 53,034 was the largest ever for an AFLW match, the fifth highest ever at Adelaide Oval, and a record for a stand-alone women's sporting event in Australia, surpassing a record set in 1920. Extra seating was hurriedly opened in the upper grandstands. The unanticipated large crowd put the city's public transport under strain. Its record as the highest women's sports crowd in Australian history was surpassed in March 2020 by the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Final, but retains the record for highest crowd at a women's football match. ==Teams== Teams were announced on 29 March 2019. Both clubs had unchanged lineups from the preliminary finals the week before: {align=center  valign=\\"top\\"   valign=\\"top\\"  } ==Match summary== co-captain Erin Phillips was named best on ground. The Blues started well, with Madison Prespakis scoring an early first goal off a 50-metre penalty on Adelaide co-captain Erin Phillips. The Crows were quick to respond with quick ball movement in the centre square from Foley to Ebony Marinoff to Anne Hatchard, who notched up their first score. A second 50-metre penalty gave Carlton another chance but was rushed through by Adelaide for a behind by Sarah Allan. The Crows were soon back on the attack, with Phillips marking just inside the 50-metre arc. Her kick fell short, but Irish recruit Ailish Considine put it through for a second goal. A third soon followed with Eloise Jones passing the ball to Hannah Martin for a goal from point-blank range. An attempt at the other end by Sarah Hosking resulted only in a behind, and yet another 50-metre penalty gave the Blues an opportunity on the siren, but the ball fell well short of the goal line. At quarter time, Carlton felt they were dominating everywhere but on the scoreboard, but this feeling would soon pass. The second quarter opened with an Adelaide goal. An overhead mark in the centre by Jones was handed off to Phillips, who booted it forward to the advantage of Stevie-Lee Thompson, who marked it and sprinted towards the goal line. Thompson proved too fast for the Carlton defenders, who were caught too far out from goal, and a goal resulted. A couple of minutes later, Phillips earned a free kick from a high tackle by Sarah Hosking. One accurate kick later, and Phillips had ten goals for the season, and Adelaide, five for the match. A mark by Renee Forth off a delivery from Deni Varnhagen nearly made it six, but she missed, scoring only a behind. The next opportunity came a few minutes later. A Carlton turnover saw Allan boot the ball forward to Chloe Scheer, who took a specky over the top of Blues defender Kerryn Harrington. She played on and delivered it to Danielle Ponter for an easy first goal. Soon after though, Scheer went down with a suspected anterior cruciate ligament injury, and was out of the game. It did not halt Adelaide, as Ponter marked a delivery from Jones inside the goal square for her second. A third followed, bringing her to twelve for the season. Tayla Harris attempted to score one against the flow of play, but it was touched on the line by Allan. It fell to Carlton captain Bri Davey to put the Blues' second goal on the scoreboard. Jones had a free kick at goal after the siren that sailed through, and Adelaide took a forty-point lead into the half time break. When play resumed after the long break, Harris started in the ruck, possibly in an attempt to get her into the game. This backfired, as she immediately collided with Davey, and went off clutching her knee. Thompson also hobbled off the ground, with an ankle injury. Both would return, but not for some time. Phillips marked a pass from Forth 40 metres out, and had her second goal of the match. Soon after, Phillips went down, clutching her knee, and had to be stretchered off the ground. The crowd gave her a standing ovation, and even the Carlton players looked upset. In the final quarter, the players had less to show for their efforts. Foley missed a shot from 35 metres out, scoring only a behind, as did Chloe Dalton at the other end. Hosking was awarded a free kick after being crunched in a tackle by Foley, but missed everything. A final effort by the Crows could not score before the final siren sounded. Phillips's injury cast a pall over the Crows' win. \\"It's an ACL,\\" she confirmed, \\"something I have done before in my other leg. This was supposed to be the good leg.\\" Despite only playing for three quarters, Phillips, who had 18 disposals and two goals, was named best on ground, as she had been when Adelaide previously won the flag in 2017. The following night she won the AFLW Players' Association's Most Valuable Player award, which she had also previously won in 2017. On 2 April, she was awarded the AFLW best and fairest award for second time, having previously won it in 2017, and was named the captain of the 2019 AFL Women's All-Australian team. Her Adelaide co-captain Chelsea Randall was named the vice captain, and Hatchard, Thompson and Marinoff were also part of the squad, as were Carlton's Prespakis, Harrington and Gabriella Pound. ==Scorecard== ==Media coverage== The game was broadcast live on Channel Seven, Fox Footy, womens.afl and the AFLW Official App. ARIA Award winner Amy Shark performed songs from her debut album Love Monster. She said that the Tayla Harris photo incident made her more determined to perform, saying that \\"[J]ust being a female in music, I'll do anything I can to help highlight any other woman trying to make it in the professional world, no matter what that field is\\". The match was watched live by a television audience of 409,000. == References == ==External links== *Official AFL Women's website Grand Final AFL Women's Grand Final 2019 Category:AFL Women's Grand Finals Category:Adelaide Football Club Category:Carlton Football Club Category:Sport in Adelaide Category:Australian rules football in South Australia ","title":"2019 AFL Women's Grand Final"},{"id":"60364797","text":"Shadang Village () is a town central area in Chenjiagang, Xiangshui County, Jiangsu, China.

The coaster is geared towards families and children, and is often seen as a junior version as the park's existing Flight Deck roller coaster. == Opening == Silver Streak opened under the name \\"Silver Surfer\\", though this was altered to the \\"Silver Streak\\" in 2007 due to copyright problems. Built alongside children's rides Jumping' Jet and Blast Off! as a brand new area known as Zoom Zone, which debuted in 2001 at the same time that Shockwave opened in the International Festival section of the park. These three family rides officially opened to the public on May 6th, 2001, replacing the Jumbo Bumps attraction, and the entrance to their common plaza can be found by Frequent Flyers. Today, in the Cedar Fair era, Zoom Zone is no longer a listed area of the park but signage still covers the plaza. Silver Streak occupies the majority of the section, and is by far the largest attraction in Kidzville. ==Characteristics== ===Model=== Silver Streak was designed and manufactured by Swiss amusement firm Vekoma, who also designed the park's Flight Deck and The Bat coasters. It is currently one of seven of Vekoma's 342m Suspended Family Coaster (SFC) models, and one of 3 located at a Cedar Fair park. ===Statistics=== Silver Streak has an overall length of roughly 1,122.1 ft (342 m), a height of 48.6 ft (14.8 m), and a total speed of 26 mph (42 km/h). The coaster is located on a 193.6 ft by 121.4 ft plot of land. ===Train=== Silver Streak operates with a single 20 passenger open-air train. The train utilizes soft over the shoulder restraints, thus minimizing any possible head-banging on the ride. ===Layout=== The coaster's layout is vastly similar to those of Vekoma's 335m Junior Coaster layout. After making a right hand turn, the train is pushed up the lift hill via booster wheels, all the way to the 48.6 foot height. It them proceeds into a helix and some other wide turns before hitting the brake run and making a right turn into the station. One cycle of the ride has an approximate duration of 1 minute and 16 seconds. ==Similar Rides== Flying Ace Aerial Chase is an identical model of Silver Streak opened that same year at King's Island in Mason, Ohio, under the name Rugrats Runaway Reptar.

One of the earliest known records of white Europeans being aware of the village inhabitants is an 1839 map depicting a 'Nickajack Creek' converging with the Chattahoochee River south and west of the Standing Peachtree settlement. The Concord Covered Bridge spanning Nickajack Creek, largely unchanged in appearance from 1872 White European settlers moved into Nickajack Creek in the mid-1800s. They formed a community initially known as 'Mill Grove', and later 'Nickajack.' The creek provided ample power to run grist, saw, cotton, and woolen mills. Robert Mable, founder of Mableton, assisted in building a gristmill owned by Henry Clay Ruff in the 1850s. Mable refined his skills as a millwright under the mentorship of Robert E. Lee at Fort Pulaski. Both Ruff's home and his mill remain standing in the portion of the creek running through Smyrna. On July 4, 1864, Union and Confederate troops clashed at Nickajack Creek in the Battle of Ruff's Mill.

The mill suffered a fire in 1889. Remnants can still be seen today. A covered bridge, originally built c. 1848-1850, traverses the stream. It is one of the few remaining covered bridges in Georgia, and still highly active today after it was later buttressed to handle automobile traffic.

Following the American Revolution, it was adopted as a symbol of the South Carolina Senate, but was stolen in 1941. Two replacements have since been used, the third and current one a gift from the Earl of Halifax. The Sword of State is listed in the FBI National Stolen Art File. ==Background== The 1951 replacement for the Sword of State is stored in the South Carolina Statehouse (pictured). The 1951 Earl of Halifax sword is carried during the procession of the Senate during the 1995 inauguration of the Governor of South Carolina. The provenance and origin of the Sword of State is unclear; however, it is known to have been adopted in 1704 by the Grand Council of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina and was used to precede state processions and ceremonies, such as the installation of governors. Following the overthrow of the Lords Proprietors in South Carolina's Revolution of 1719, authority for the sword passed to His Majesty's Council for South Carolina. After the declaration of independence of South Carolina in 1776, the sword was borne by the Sheriff of Charleston County and used to lead the procession of John Rutledge on the occasion of his inauguration as president of South Carolina. It was later deposited in the chamber of the South Carolina Senate where it remained, being occasionally used for Senate ceremonies, until the American Civil War when it was seized as a war trophy by the United States during the March to the Sea, and later lost. Some years later it was rediscovered in a museum in Philadelphia and returned to the South Carolina Senate. In 1941 the Sword of State was stolen. State officials were initially unconcerned at its theft, assuming it would eventually be returned; the Mace of the South Carolina House of Representatives had periodically been stolen over the previous centuries and always recovered. However, in 1968 ‚Äì with the sword still missing ‚Äì state officials publicly requested the culprit return the artifact in time for the tricentennial of South Carolina, agreeing that \\"no questions\\" would be asked. As of 2019, the sword had still not been recovered. It is listed in the National Stolen Art File of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Following its theft, a cavalry saber was borrowed from the Charleston Museum for use by the Senate until 1951 when the Earl of Halifax, learning of the blade's loss, procured a replacement from Wilkinson Sword of London. ==Description== Only one photograph of the original Sword of State is known to exist. The blade is wavy, in length and made of what is believed to have been imported steel. The sword has a silver hilt, (), and was possibly crafted in Charleston, though some believe the craftsmanship too complex to have originated in colonial South Carolina. ==See also== * History of South Carolina * Sword of state == References == ==External links== * Image of the Sword of State * Image of Sergeant-at-Arms James Melton carrying the 1951 replacement for the Sword of State Category:Government of South Carolina Category:Swords of the United States ","title":"Sword of State of South Carolina"},{"id":"60364931","text":"Piccadilly Jim is a romantic comedy film directed by John McKay, starring Sam Rockwell and Frances O'Connor.

Costumed and festooned to a faretheewell, [it] lavishes more attention on its eclectic mix of decor than its uneven ensemble of actors. ‚Ä¶ Production designer Amanda McArthur‚Äôs and costume designer Ralph Hole‚Äôs innovative meld of ‚Äô30s, ‚Äô50s and ‚Äô70s styles gives [the film] a jazzy freewheeling feel, further enhanced by Adrian Johnston‚Äôs era-sampling score. But in his haste to liberate his period reconstruction from any ‚ÄúMasterpiece Theatre‚Äù-type historical handcuffs, helmer John McKay also frees it from the discipline of pinpoint comic timing and the exercise of spirited, lively exchange.\\" Chris Barsanti, Contactmusic.com: \\"A rather hysterical oddity that can't decide what era it's set in or what mood to play, Piccadilly Jim just chucks it all at the screen and hopes that some wit will come through and generate some laughs. ‚Ä¶ Careening from full-throttle farce to light-hearted badinage to earnest romance, there's no unified tone, and with the addition of pointless anachronisms (although the general look is the 1930s, there are some additions like modern automobiles and torch singers belting out new wave tunes) it just seems like a big old mess. In the midst of all this atonal turmoil, a good number of cast members are doing their game best to have a good time, and it shows.\\" John Ralske, AllMovie: \\"Rockwell can't always save a film, but he's always fun to watch, and for the most part, Piccadilly Jim is engaging when he's onscreen. Director John McKay tries to capture a kind of anarchic spirit that he finds in P.G. Wodehouse's work, as opposed to sticking strictly to the text, so anachronisms abound, most notably in the set design, the music, and the mismatched style of the performances. ‚Ä¶ McKay is aiming for something freewheeling and loose-limbed, but Piccadilly Jim never quite comes together. It's mildly entertaining -- cute even -- but it's also kind of a mess.\\" Brian Taves, in his book P. G. Wodehouse and Hollywood, was critical of the film. Taves argued that, in attempting to modernize the story, the film lost much of the subtle, light-hearted humour that was present in Wodehouse's original novel and its 1936 film adaptation. Taves noted as an example that, whereas Jim's insouciance is shown in the 1936 film when the butler Bayliss finds Jim asleep after a late night with his feet on the pillow where his head should be, the 2004 film has Bayliss find Jim in bed with three scantily clad women. Taves further argued that the film presented Jim as a true wastrel and womanizer who is incapable of remorse, whereas Jim is a more remorseful and sympathetic character in the original novel. Taves also felt that the use of songs, costumes, and automobiles from various time periods created a lack of internal coherence. However, Taves was more positive about the portrayals of some of the film's supporting characters, particularly of Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of Bingley Crocker.Taves (2006), pp. 138‚Äì144. ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * ==External links== * * Category:2004 films Category:2004 romantic comedy films Category:Films directed by John McKay Category:Films based on works by P.

The party was established on May 30, 1823 by Guadalupe Victoria and Sim√≥n de Ch√°vez in Puente del Rey (now Puente Nacional). The organization's main goal was facilitating the freedom of the Americans. The organization was considered to be the first political party founded in independent Mexico before later merging into the Mexican Liberal Party. == Great Legion of the Black Eagle in Mexico == When the Great Black Eagle Legion was created, Guadalupe Victoria was the commanding general of Jalapa (now known as Xalpa). With the failure of Agustin de Iturbide's empire, Mexico faced the challenges of establishing itself since Congress had annulled the Treaty of C√≥rdoba and the Plan of Iguala. A republican constitution was established as the main governing system in 1824, although it had not been decided whether it would be a central or federal republic. There was also intense pressure for each province to remain autonomous. In addition to these problems, there were different positions on how or if the church should intervene in society. Jos√© Ignacio Garc√≠a Illueca That the struggle for independence had religious aspects for both the insurgents and the colonial army, but once the first Mexican empire was established, the role of the church was rigorously questioned. This uncertainty only grew with the rise of Freemasonry from 1821 to 1823. At the end of the struggle for independence, freemasonry based on the Scottish Rite had already been established in Mexico. Led by Felipe Mart√≠nez de Arag√≥n and Fausto Elhuyar, It had been joined by men who served Juan O'Donoj√∫, such as Manuel Codorni√∫; deputies who were back from C√°diz, such as Miguel Ramos Arizpe, Mariano Michelena and Lorenzo de Zavala, and Mexicans of the elite like Jos√© Mar√≠a Fagoaga, Jos√© Ignacio Garc√≠a Illueca, and Tomas Murphy. Manuel Codorniu It is said that Scottish Freemasonry played a very important role in the fall of the empire of Iturbide. The Scots were mostly followers of the constitutional monarchy and Bourbonists. The foundation of The Great Legion of the Black Eagle had two objectives: the collaboration in the search for Cuban independence and the desire of Guadalupe Victoria to create a political party that would favor him and neutralize the political impulse and power of The Scottish Rite members. Concerning Cuban independence, it is evident that the Great Black Eagle Legion intended to favor it or even achieve the annexation of Cuba by Mexico. The Black Eagle Party claimed to work against despotism and in favor of freedom. In 1823, the GLAN indicated that its object was to completely remove the yoke of slavery which the Spanish had been using for 300 yearsRelaciones 111, summer 2007, vol. XXVIII, p.148 In this epoch, the supporters of several political projects that included the republicans, federalists, centralist, those who supported a constitutional monarchy, representatives of several ecclesiastical sectors, and who expounded a moldable position were considered liberals. For the Great Legion of the Black Eagle, however, the true liberals were the republicans - those who they recognized as proponents of freedom, independence from Spain, equality, and patriotism. Guadalupe Victoria proposed to constitute a government headed by an insurgent and that he was also the only insurgent who differed by rejecting the Iguala Plan so as not to abandon his independence plan, for which he proclaimed himself a republican. Therefore, being a member of the Great Black Eagle Legion indicated that you had to support Guadalupe Victoria for the presidency and support her political plan. The antipathy of the Great Legion of the Black Eagle for religion was very radical compared to other political sectors, like the Yorkinos. According to the documents of the Great Black Eagle Legion, they were not opposed to religion, but as time passed their opinions hardened as they upheld the rule of preventing Clerics and Friars from entering the association as being of the utmost importance because they saw them as being harmful to society for growing their religious fanaticism, making people live in brutality. For the Great Legion of the Black Eagle, it was not only a matter of fighting against religious fanaticism, but they also wanted to banish faith entirely. They considered this to be fundamental for the union and social order since in the Constitution of 1824 the Catholic religion was established as the only one in the whole nation. In the statutes of the Great Legion of the Black Eagle, this was declared alien to the other associations of the Masonic type, comunero and coalman; and they were the opposite of a Masonic society because they did not ask for quotas or oaths, the degrees did not agree with those of any other Masonic rite, they did not meet constantly and there were no relations of brotherhood between them. But in the \\"instructions to the deputies of the states,\\" it showed in some way that the Great Legion of the Black Eagle had merged with the York Rite. Lorenzo de Zavala. In March 1823, Guadalupe Victoria was appointed a member of the provisional Executive Power. On June 8, 1824, the members of the Great Legion of the Black Eagle met in Jalapa, the current capital of Veracruz, to make agreements before the departure of Guadalupe Victoria to Mexico City, who on October 1, 1824, became president-elect of the Mexican Republic. Abandoning thus the Great Legion of the Black Eagle. Once promoted to power, it took a lot of momentum with a performance almost equal to that of Freemasonry of the York Rite. Once in power, Guadalupe Victoria maintained his plan to promote the independence of Cuba. At this time, he presented a new plan for a military expedition to the Congress of his country, which was accepted by the Senate after many discussions. (...) 1. The Government is authorized to undertake a military expedition with the Republic of Colombia in order to support the efforts of the inhabitants of Cuba in the consummation of their independence. 2. In the event that the cause of freedom triumphs in Cuba, the Government is obliged to seek by all means to establish in it the national representation with the same bases and rights of the people as in the new American Republics.Ch√°vez Orozco, p. XLIV For Guadalupe Victoria, this alliance gave the green light for Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to make the expedition that he had prepared in Yucat√°n. However, this did not go ahead due to other international events that affected the Latin American environment. Among these problems was that the United States still considered Cuba and Puerto Rico within its commercial interests and as good options for its territorial expansion. Before the expedition could not be done, it was possible to consolidate the alliance between Colombia and Mexico on March 17, 1826. These countries signed a treaty that regulated their collaboration to fight against Spain, both in the Antilles and on the coasts of the continent. This agreement was called the Operations Plan for the combined squad of Mexico and Colombia. In this project Mexico - Colombia members of the Great Black Eagle Legion were involved. The separation of the conspiracy of the Great Legion of the Black Eagle occurred at the same time as the transformations occurred in European politics that discouraged the Spanish plans for the reconquest of America. The independence of the Hispanic countries and Mexico along with the loss of commercial exchange between Havana and Veracruz due to an 1826 treaty with Cuba caused the abandonment of efforts to free Cuba. == The Great Legion of the Black Eagle in Cuba == Through the action of Sim√≥n de Ch√°vez and other Cubans, the Great Legion of the Black Eagle spread from Mexico to Cuba with ease. In 1826 the musician Jos√© Rubio traveled to Havana carrying a copy of the tenets of the Black Eagle, which were then handed over to Manuel Rojo to establish the Legion in Cuba. These statutes had to be adopted by the different groups in Mexico, but retained its purpose. Once the Great Legion of the Black Eagle was founded in Cuba, it had the full support of Mexico and Colombia. This continued until the Spanish authorities in Havana discovered its existence in 1829. The Great Legion of the Black Eagle in Cuba aimed to obtain supporters to achieve the Independence of Cuba and change the government there through the help of Mexico. On December 23, 1829, the Spanish minister in Philadelphia reached out to the government of La Habana to inform them that Mr. Jos√© Sol√≠s was in contact with and member of a society called San Juanista of which he was a member. This society was governed under the same customs as those with the name of Sol de Bol√≠var. Sol√≠s was born in New Orleans and moved to Havana. On January 25, 1830, the president of the Military Commission, Jos√© Cadaval, appointed Captain Tomas de Salazar prosecutor for the investigation of the case. Captain Tomas de Salazar quickly began his investigation and discovered that there was a father and son with the same name and surname. Father and son both had a bad reputation. These two were investigated but there were no results. On February 8 of that same year, Captain Tomas de Salazar was ordered to apprehend the Sol√≠s. Their respective homes were investigated. They found no issue with the father, but the son was in possession of suspicious documents. Among the documents of Jos√© Sol√≠s Jr. were letters, a Masonic diploma in his name, documents in number and documents of the Masonic type. Sol√≠s Jr. was determined to be great danger and accused of conspiring to disturb public order. The Great Legion of the Black Eagle was looking for the independence of Cuba Sol√≠s gave his first statement on February 12, 1830. Sol√≠s explained that Lucas Ugarte, Secretary of the Patriotic Society, had asked him to be a Mason. Sol√≠s found out through Ugarte that this Masonic society had been transformed into The great legion of the Black Eagle. One of the letters that Jos√© Sol√≠s had in his possession was addressed to Mateo Somellan and sent by Manuel Ronquillo from New Orleans. In this letter, he reported that the people whose assistance was needed for matters of Independence had not confirmed their participation due to lack of money. Jos√© Sol√≠s also stated that he had learned from conversations that Manuel Abreu had weapons to use at any time for the benefit of independence. He was only waiting on news that was expected from Veracruz, Mexico. Once the crimes of freemasonry and conspiracy for independence were announced, the prosecutor Tom√°s de Salazar questioned Sol√≠s again, in order to discover who was the boss of The great legion of the Black Eagle. On February 24, 1830, Jos√© Sol√≠s, after being held incommunicado in the Bethlehem Barracks, on February 19, 1830, declared that he did not know how many people were introduced in The Black Legion's Great Legion and did not know the time when he began. Solis was aware that the first establishment of this society was in Mexico, where it had extended to Cuba. On the night of the 26th and the morning of the 27th, Lucas Ugarte, Diego Araoz, Felix Rodriguez Hermida, Gabriel Pel√°ez, Manuel Abreu, Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, Gabino Hern√°ndez, Juan Salda√±a, Marcos Fern√°ndez Casta√±eda, Gaspar Acosta, Miguel V√°zquez, Jos√© Gonz√°lez √Åvila, Jos√© Encalada, Francisco Pacheco, Manuel Rojo, Pedro Pablo Pel√°ez, Francisco Cordero and Rafael Gatica were among those who were captured. Pedro Muros could not be apprehended due to being in New Orleans, and Juan Nepomuceno Escobedo became at large in the countryside. Adri√°n del Valle, p.42 It was never known exactly who was the leader of the Great Legion of the Black Eagle in Cuba, although there were suspicions that it was Manuel Rojo, one of the most prestigious lawyers in Havana. == See also == * History of Mexico * First Mexican Empire * First Mexican Republic == References == == Bibliography in Spanish == * Del Valle, Adrian.

The international community recognizes the Golan Heights to be official Syrian territory and widely rejects Israeli military occupation. Following the war, Syria dismissed any negotiations with Israel as part of the Khartoum Resolution. The Golan was under military administration until the Knesset passed the Golan Heights Law in 1981, which applied Israeli law to the territory; a move that has been described as an annexation. In response, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed UNSC Resolution 497 which condemned the Israeli actions to change the status of the territory declaring them \\"null and void and without international legal effect\\", and that the Golan remained an occupied territory. In 2019, the United States became the only state to recognize the Golan Heights as Israeli sovereign territory, while the rest of the international community continues to consider the territory Syrian held under Israeli military occupation. ==British and French Mandates== Following World War I, portions of the former territory of the Ottoman Empire was split into several League of Nations mandates under the control of one of the victorious Allied countries of the war. The British Mandate for Palestine and the French Mandate for Syria were two such mandates, with the border finalized between the two in the Paulet‚ÄìNewcombe Agreement. The border, drawn in 1923, was the first international border between Syria and Palestine and to date is the last, with the remaining boundaries since then having been a result of armistice agreements. The boundary placed the entirety of the Sea of Galilee, along with a ten meter wide strip on the eastern shore, within the British Mandate. The French Mandate ended in 1946 with the independence of the Republic of Syria, and Syria demanded changes to the border to allow for greater access to fresh water sources, demands the British refused on the basis that the border had been submitted and approved to the League of Nations and Britain thus considered the matter closed. ==Post-mandate period== The 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, which followed Israel's declaration of independence, resulted in the newly formed state of Israel in control over roughly 77% of what had been the territory of the British Mandate. Syria had however advanced to the eastern shoreline of the Sea of Galilee, where the border as delineated by the British and the French was ten meters east of the shoreline. In the armistice negotiations that followed the declaration of a ceasefire, that ten meter strip was included in a demilitarized zone as Israel had argued for. ==Six-Day War and aftermath== In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the Syrian Golan. Following the war, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 242, which called on Israel to withdraw from territories occupied in the war in exchange for the termination of all states of belligerency and recognition of Israel as a sovereign state by the Arab states. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War saw further territorial gains by Israel, though Israel agreed to return to the 1967 ceasefire line in the 1974 disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria. Syria has continued to insist on the return of the Golan in any negotiated peace agreement between the two countries. == Golan Heights Law == On 14 December 1981 the Israeli Knesset passed the Golan Heights Law. While the law did not use the term annexation, it was considered to be an annexation by the Israeli opposition and international community.Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Golan Heights Law. The action was condemned internationally, and in response the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 497 declaring the law \\"null and void and without international legal effect\\" and that the Fourth Geneva Convention continued to apply to the Golan as an occupied territory.Council on Foreign Relations. UN Security Council Resolution 497. ==International views== The international community widely considers the Golan to be Syrian territory held under Israeli occupation. A number of states recognize the Israeli occupation as being legitimate under the United Nations Charter on a self-defense basis, but do not consider those concerns to allow for the annexation of territory seized by force. In March 2019, the United States, which previously considered the Golan Heights to be occupied, became the first country to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the territory it has held since 1967. The rest of the international community continues to view the territory as Syrian held under Israeli occupation. The European Union members of the United Nations Security Council issued a joint statement condemning the US announcement and the UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres issued a statement saying that the status of the Golan Heights had not changed. The Arab League denounced the US move, declaring that \\"Trump's recognition does not change the area's status.\\" == See also == * Borders of Israel * Israeli-occupied territories * Israel‚ÄìSyria relations ==References== Category:Golan Heights ","title":"Status of the Golan Heights"},{"id":"60364975","text":"Daniel Neufeld (1814 ‚Äì 15 October 1874) was a Polish-born Jewish author, poet, and educator. ==Biography== Daniel Neufeld was born to a Jewish family in Praszka, where he received a traditional cheder education. At the age of 13 he enrolled in a provincial grammar school run by the Piarist Fathers in Wielu≈Ñ, but did not graduate, possibly because of his involvement in the November Uprising. Neufeld opened a Jewish boys' school in 1838, with a curriculum that included the exact sciences, foreign language, and principles of progressive Judaism. Neufeld moved to Chenstokhov in 1840, establishing there a private boarding school for Jewish boys. Neufeld settled in Warsaw in 1861, where worked as an editor of Samuel Orgelbrand's Encyklopedia powszechna (until 1868) and as a teacher in Jewish government schools. There he published a work on the Great Sanhedrin of 1806 under the title Wielki Sanhedryn Paryski w Roku 1806. On 5 July 1861, Neufeld commenced the publication in Polish of a Jewish weekly newspaper entitled ' (), which sought to promote among Jews the Polish language and way of life. The periodical was closed during the January Uprising on 23 October 1863 and he was exiled to Siberia. Upon returning to Warsaw two years later, the tsarist authorities forbade Neufeld from teaching or printing in the press. He instead dedicated himself to promoting progressive Judaism and assimilation. He published a Polish translation of the books of Genesis and Exodus, with a commentary (1863); a pamphlet on the establishment of a Jewish consistory in Poland entitled Urzadzenie Konsystorza Zydowskiego w Polsce; a gnomology of the fathers of the Synagogue; and Polish translations of the siddur and the Haggadah (1865). Towards the end of his life Neufeld settled in Piotrk√≥w, where he served as the honorary director of a Jewish hospital. He died in Warsaw in October 1874. ==References== Category:1814 births Category:1874 deaths Category:Jewish poets Category:Jewish translators of the Bible Category:Polish editors Category:Polish Jews Category:Translators of the Bible into Polish Category:Translators to Polish ","title":"Daniel Neufeld"},{"id":"60364976","text":"Guy Chester Shortridge (1880‚Äì1949) was a South African mammalogist who undertook expeditions in his own state, in Java, Guatemala, Southern India, Burma and at the prompting of Oldfield Thomas travelled to Southwest Australia. == Biography == Guy Chester Shortridge was born at Honiton, Devon on 21 June 1880, the son of a medical practitioner. He served in the police force during the Boer War. His interest in natural history was advanced to a career with the support of W. L. Sclater of the South African Museum. He returned to England and met Oldfield Thomas, who suggested an expedition to Western Australia. He also joined collecting expeditions to Java, New Guinea, Guatemala and on the Indian subcontinent. Shortridge eventually returned to South Africa and was director of the Kaffrarian Museum in King William's Town at the end of his life. He died on 12 January 1949. == Works == Shortridge is noted for his collections, including living animals, made in regions where little of no zoological research had been undertaken. He was first engaged by Sclater to assemble specimen collections in South Africa, birds and mammals he obtained in the Pondoland and Colesberg regions. His collections in Southwest Australia, made between 1904 and 1907, were at the coastal forests around Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River and King George Sound. Shortridge travelled to regions accessible via the Great Southern Railway on a rail pass granted by the government. He also travelled to make collections at the semi-arid to desert interior of Southwest Australia to the Gascoyne region, making collections at Laverton, Kalgoorlie, Southern Cross, and an offshore visit to Bernier Island. Shortridge's collection was made at a period that provides rare historical data and specimens, obtained in a period of local or complete extinction of mammal species in Southwest Australia. Details of the relative abundance or absence of species has been found in his extensive notes and correspondence with Bernard H. Woodward, director of the Western Australian Museum, with the museum's collector John Tunney, and with his local informants. The birds he obtained in the southwest of Australia were detailed in The Ibis (1909, 1910) by the ornithologist W. R. Ogilvie-Grant, curator of the British Museum's collections of birds. A later expedition to the western region of Java resulted in the collection of 1500 specimens of mammals. In 1908 Shortridge was engaged by the Zoological Society to capture live mammals in Guatemala, his next journey was with the British Ornithologists' Union on a major expedition to New Guinea. He became active in field research in India, and associated with the Bombay Natural History Society, and made notable collections in Southern India and Burma of poorly examined mammal species. == Legacy == Guy Shortridge was commemorated in the naming of animals and new taxa, including a rodent species Mastomys shortridgei (Shortridge's multimammate mouse), a bat Miniopterus shortridgei, Shortridge's langur Trachypithecus shortridgei and those he described himself, such as the subspecies Papio ursinus ruacana Shortridge 1942, named as Shortridge's chacma baboon. His notes and letters during the period in Southwest Australia have provided information to later researchers, in particular the examination of the local extinction of mammals at the time of his visit. == References == === Notes=== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Category:Zoological collectors Category:1880 births Category:1949 deaths Category:South African zoologists Category:Mammalogists Category:People from Honiton Category:British mammalogists Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Guy C.

Her autobiography, which tells the story of her life and work as a prostitute, was published by Harper & Brothers Publishers in 1919. == Early life == === Childhood === As Madeleine published her autobiography using a pseudonym, her real identity has never been uncovered. Therefore, both her date of birth and the exact origins of her family cannot be ascertained. She was a third generation American, whose parents moved from the Atlantic seaboard to settle in \\"a thriving town of the Middle West.\\" While never naming the specific location of her childhood, Madeleine describes it in her autobiography as a \\"new and crude\\" town, with few opportunities. She was the second eldest child of a large family, and her father was a well-respected member of the community. Madeleine's upbringing was in line with that of an upper-class child; her family employed a laundress and a cook. She had access to education and a wide variety of literature, and proved at a young age to have both an appetite and a talent for learning. Her parents were also religious, and she was raised with a \\"strict heaven and hell belief,\\" which strongly influenced her throughout the rest of her life. === Worsening conditions === However, the happy childhood that Madeleine describes in her autobiography did not last. The first disruption was an incident in which her father discovered her playing with the laundress's son. He became enraged and attacked both her and the other child before being stopped by Madeleine's mother. Madeleine soon learned from the family's cook that her father was an alcoholic who had been drinking for the past two years and that, despite her mother's efforts to hide his alcoholism, his condition had steadily been worsening. After this initial incident, Madeleine's father continued to beat her. Eventually, he sold his business and left the family for several months. When he returned, the family's home was sold under mortgage and they subsequently moved into a small house in a poor neighborhood. After this move, Madeleine's father lost his job and left once again to find work in a pattern that would continue throughout Madeleine's adolescence. Madeleine's older brother left school and began working to support the family in their father's absence. That fall, Madeleine herself turned thirteen, but as there was no demand for child labor in their town she was unable to help her brother in supporting the family. Madeleine recalls the winter following her thirteenth birthday as one of the worst of her life. Her family could not afford to continue to send her to school, and a new baby only added increased strain to the household. The family was regularly cold and hungry, and Madeleine describes that \\"at regular intervals father came home, drunk and demoniacal, to sober up, repent, and become again that courteous gentleman, the kindly parent, the loving husband of his brief sober periods.\\" In spring, the family's situation worsened further as they were forced to move to the worst neighborhood in town. The neighboring women, while ostensibly employed in other businesses, worked additionally as prostitutes. These women became Madeleine's only companions throughout her teenage years as she and her older brother never returned to school. With her mother preoccupied with the younger children, her brother working, and her father often absent, Madeleine began to be propositioned by her father's previous friends. When she was seventeen, she had sex for the first time, which remained a deep source of shame throughout her life. Shortly after Madeleine had turned seventeen, her family received a letter from a former servant, Mrs. James, who had married and was living in St. Louis. The woman suggested that Madeleine come to St. Louis to live with her and work in a factory, and she offered to pay for the travel expenses and take care of the girl. At this point, Madeleine's family had not heard from her father in nearly a year. She and her mother agreed that the move St. Louis would be in the best interest of both Madeleine and her family, who were at this point being supported exclusively by Madeleine's older brother, and Madeleine said a painful goodbye to her family soon after. == St. Louis == === Arrival === Upon arriving in St. Louis, Madeleine began boarding with Mrs. James, who found her work as a check-girl at a factory where Mrs. James was the forewoman. Although Madeleine was adept at the job, she struggled to fit in socially with the girls who boarded and worked with her in St. Louis. After about two months in the city she became sick, and when her health worsened to the point that she was unable to work. Mrs. James took Madeleine to a physician, where they discovered that the girl was pregnant. Madeleine, deeply ashamed, admitted to Mrs. James that she had had sex. The two decided that they would keep the pregnancy a secret from Madeleine's mother, and although Mrs. James was sympathetic and insisted that no man would have taken advantage of Madeleine if her father had been there to protect her, Madeleine resolved to run away in order to bear her disgrace alone. Grand Union Station, St. Louis, 1894 === Running away === Madeleine secretly packed her belongings and left Mrs. James' home. She hailed a streetcar and rode it to the end of the line, where she aimlessly wandered through a suburb of the city. Eventually Madeleine took refuge in a drugstore, where she bought stationary and a stamp and wrote a letter to Mrs. James. As she was leaving the drugstore, Madeleine was propositioned by the owner, who blocked her way out. When she lashed out angrily at him, he let her pass. She once again hailed a streetcar and this time rode to Union Station, where she bought food and set out to find a room for the night. After wandering outside the station Madeleine became frightened and retreated back to the station waiting room, where she subsequently fell asleep. She was woken by the Depot Master who, upon learning that she was not waiting for a train and had nowhere to go, took her to a hotel where she could spend the night. After her first night alone in St. Louis, Madeleine set out to find work. Without connections or knowledge of the city, she had no success, and her money shortly ran out. Left alone and hungry in the cold October weather, Madeleine spent the night with a man for shelter who, when asked the next morning, refused to pay her. She subsequently took shelter in a department store, where she scavenged food scraps from a garbage bin and wrote two letters, one to Mrs. James and one to her Mother, assuring both that she was alright. That night, Madeleine found herself on the streets, where she was propositioned by a black man. After vehemently denying him, she created a commotion which drew the attention of another man, who stopped to see if she was hurt. When she explained her situation, the driver took Madeleine to a lodging house, where he provided her with a room, food, a bath, and money to buy breakfast the next morning before leaving and promising that they would have lunch together the next day. Madeleine remained with this man, who she estimated to be about ten years her senior, for a number of days, and he continued to provide her with food, clothes, and lodging. Eventually, he explained to Madeleine that he had previously contracted a venereal disease but that his doctor had cured him. He asked Madeleine to sleep with him despite the risk of contracting the disease, and she agreed, feeling indebted after his generosity. Madeleine later accompanied her host to Kansas City on a business trip. During this time, Madeleine maintained correspondence with both her mother and Mrs. James, who helped hide the reality of her situation from her family. == Entry into prostitution == === Kansas City === After a week in Kansas City, Madeleine contracted the same disease that her host had previously contracted. As she was unable to travel, the man left Madeleine in the care of a physician and with enough money to take care of herself, asking her to return to him once she was healthy again. While in the hospital, Madeleine became acquainted with a prostitute named Mamie, who worked at a house on Fourth Street and had been in the business for six years. Mamie talked to Madeleine about her job and advised the girl to go to a house, which would provide some measure of comfort and protection, once she lost the man who was supporting her. She insisted that Madeleine should never go to the streets. During her stay in the hospital, Madeleine continued to receive letters from the man in St. Louis. After three weeks, she was well enough to return to him. However, at this point Madeleine was about six months pregnant and would no longer be able to keep her condition secret. Rather than tell him the truth, she contacted Mamie, who in turn put Madeleine into contact with her landlady, Miss Laura. A few days later, Madeleine began living and working at Miss Laura's brothel, where she first took on the name Madeleine Blair. === Miss Laura's brothel === Miss Laura's house was one of three first-class brothels in Kansas City; Miss Laura had started as prostitute herself, and she treated the girls fairly and kindly. However, Madeleine's reluctance to entertain the men and her dislike for liquor made it difficult for her to adjust to her new occupation. Eventually, Miss Laura introduced Madeleine to a man, Paul Martin, who would become her supporter, lover, and confidant for many years. While he looked down upon prostitution as a necessary evil, he quickly became partial to Madeleine and visited her frequently. When he left town, he continued to write her letters. As her pregnancy progressed, Madeleine received support from the other girls in the brothel, many of whom were excited for the baby. However, the pregnancy was difficult for Madeleine --who did not want the baby--and was made more difficult by the venereal disease she had previously contracted. When Madeleine refused to see the house physician, Miss Laura called a friend who was a physician to care for Madeleine. Madeleine's baby daughter died either during or shortly after the birth, but the doctor became a close friend during her time in his care. Once Madeleine had recovered, the doctor offered to support her in returning home and seeking an education. Madeleine accepted his offer, with encouragement from the other girls in the brothel as well as Miss Laura. == Chicago == === Return home === Madeleine and the doctor arranged to meet Mrs. James in St. Louis, who would help conceal from her family the true story of how Madeleine had met her benefactor. The three decided that Madeleine should return home for a visit before coming back to St. Louis to attend a private school. Madeleine was greeted warmly by her family upon her return. Her father was once again absent, and the family hadn't heard from him since he had written from Eastern Illinois three months previously. Madeleine also learned that her older brother would leave in June to go West with the firm he had been working for. When she informed her of the plans to attend school in St. Louis, Madeleine was unable to assuage her mother's doubts. Not wanting to raise suspicions as to how she had met her doctor friend, she decided instead to go to Chicago to seek work. Her mother consented to this plan, and Madeleine wrote letters to Mrs. James and the doctor to inform them of the situation. She additionally wrote a letter to Paul, telling him that she had left prostitution. === Arrival in Chicago === Madeleine arrived in Chicago shortly after her eighteenth birthday. She found lodging in a south-side boarding house and got a job in a large department store, where she made good money and ingratiated herself with the customers. During this time, Madeleine continued her correspondence with both Paul and the doctor. Some time after her arrival in Chicago, Madeleine received a letter which informed her of bad news from home. Her brother had fallen sick out West and was unable to send money home, and her father had been in jail for two months in a different town. Upon the discovery of her father's imprisonment, the sheriff had gone to check on the condition of Madeleine's family. Finding them living in poverty, with Madeleine's mother sick, it was decided that her mother would be sent to the county poorhouse and the rest of the children would be taken away. Madeleine promptly quit her job at the department store, left her boarding house, and sent a letter to her mother containing money and saying that she had received a pay raise and would be able to support the family. === Custom House Place === Chicago Art Institute, 1900 After quitting her job, Madeleine sought out a department store customer, Madame C., a French-Canadian who ran the brothel Custom House Place. Following a brief interview, Madame agreed to lodge Madeleine, and she began to work as a prostitute once again. Due to Madeleine's continued disdain for both prostitution and liquor, however, she was quickly rejected by the other girls of the house. On her first night of work, Madeleine met a customer who suggested that she seek work instead at a higher caliber house on Dearborn Street that was run more fairly than Custom House Place. After her first night in Custom House Place, Madeleine wrote to both Paul and the doctor informing them that she had returned to prostitution. She additionally wrote a letter to her mother, comforting her, and to an Eastern relative, explaining her father's situation and asking for help for the family. Madeleine continued to work for three weeks at Custom House Place, which she found to be a cutthroat and hostile environment. Many of the girls working in the house were children of immigrants who had been brought up as part of the city's working class, and Madeleine viewed them as morally degraded. However, she was extremely successful financially. After saving some money, Madeleine contacted the customer who had initially suggested she find work on Dearborn Street and asked for his help in leaving Custom House Place. He recruited a friend, and the three were successful in tricking Madame C. into letting Madeleine leave without any fuss. The two men who had helped her paid for Madeleine to spend two weeks in a hotel, during which time she explored the city and discovered a love for art at the Art Institute. The initial customer became a sort of father figure to Madeleine, encouraging her in her studies of literature and the Bible. === Dearborn Street === After her brief vacation, Madeleine sought work at the house on Dearborn Street. There, she was hired by Miss Allen, an austere and civilized woman who ran the first- class house with an iron fist. On her first night, an older prostitute named Olga Howard took Madeleine under her wing. The two soon became friends, and Madeleine found that the girls at Miss Allen's house--who, she describes, \\"were of good American stock and possessed some degree of education\\" \\\\--were less competitive and more cooperative than the girls at Custom House Place had been. Madeleine worked on and off at Miss Allen's house for the next five years, and even the cold mistress eventually grew fond of her. During her first few months at the house on Dearborn Street, Madeleine continued her studies and delighted in learning from the upper class customers that she serviced. After five months, however, she discovered that she was pregnant once again. Madeleine decided to leave Miss Allen's house to visit home, but changed her plans when she received a letter from Paul, who was in Kansas City. Upon visiting him there, Paul asked Madeleine to move to Montana and marry him. Madeleine refused, informing Paul that she was pregnant. They parted ways after their brief visit, and Madeleine went to visit her family. After arriving home, Madeleine stayed with her family for two weeks. Her father, who had been released from prison, was sober and had been diagnosed with Bright's disease. Unable to believe the stories that Madeleine offered, he went to Chicago to investigate and discovered that his daughter had been working as a prostitute. The two fought, and her father ensured that Madeleine was disowned from the family; she never saw her mother or siblings again. Her father died three years later. == Motherhood == === Return to Dearborn Street === Following her visit to her family, Madeleine returned to Chicago. She gave birth to a son, who she loved dearly. Eight months after his birth, she returned to her work at the house on Dearborn Street. She continued her correspondence with Paul, who visited her twice in Chicago and sometimes sent money to support her. When her son was two years old, the financial strain of caring for her child forced Madeleine to leave him with a nurse and go to Winnipeg, where the cost of living was cheaper and prostitutes could make more money. === Winnipeg === In Winnipeg, Madeleine worked at the brothel of Madame von Levin. The house stood on the prairie about two miles outside of town, and the girls who worked there were mostly Americans. Madeleine found the men to be more agreeable than those she had encountered in the cities where she had worked previously, and she spent many happy hours exploring the nature that surrounded the brothel. After saving up money, she returned to Chicago. Upon her return, however, Madeleine found the house where she had left her son deserted. === Kidnapping === Her nurse's neighbors informed Madeleine that the woman had left with the baby a week before, claiming that his mother had abandoned him. Madeleine wrote to the nurse and went to LaCrosse, Wisconsin, where the nurse's family lived, to search for the woman. With the help of local police, Madeleine was able to track down the nurse. Once the situation was explained, the girl's mother insisted that she return Madeleine's son. === Chicago === Back in Chicago, Madeleine began renting a flat and devoted herself to raising her son. Reluctant to bring customers into the home where her child lived, she found work at a brothel on Indiana Avenue, in the South Side of the city. The owner of the brothel agreed that Madeleine could spend her days at her flat with her son as long as she spent nights working. Many of the women who worked at the house on Indiana Avenue with Madeleine were of a higher social status than the other prostitutes that she had worked with; some were engaged or married women who worked secretly for the extra money, and others were respected students at the Conservatory of Music or the Art Institute. Most of these women, like Madeleine, kept their profession secret from the public. After some time, a disagreement over a customer with the woman who ran the brothel resulted in Madeleine leaving her work at the house on Indiana Avenue. She took a break from working and subsequently devoted all her time to her son. Her happy respite was interrupted, however, when she visited a doctor and discovered that she was fourth months pregnant. Upon returning from the doctor, Madeleine found that her son had grown sick with pneumonia. She sent for the physician that she had just visited, but the man was ultimately unable to help. After six days, the boy died. Olga arranged for the child's funeral and contacted Paul, who came to visit in hopes of comforting Madeleine. However, she lashed out angrily at him and refused to see him; he returned to Montana. A month after her son's death, Madeleine ended her third pregnancy by inducing a miscarriage; she discovered that she would have had twins. She nearly died from peritonitis but recovered; following her recovery, she returned to work at Miss Allen's house. She was twenty two. == Journey West == === Butte, Montana === After some time back at Miss Allen's, Olga convinced Madeleine to go to Montana and seek out Paul, hoping the trip would lift her friend's spirits. Upon her arrival, Madeleine discovered that Paul would be out of town for several weeks. While exploring the town on her own, she happened across a man who had been her customer in Chicago. The two spent the evening together, visiting Butte's variety shows and dance halls as well as its \\"cribs,\\" which inspired pity and horror in Madeleine. At the cribs, Madeleine ran into another acquaintance from Chicago--this time a girl, Norma, who had worked with her at Miss Allen's house. After a tearful reunion, Norma explained that she had fallen onto hard times and discouraged Madeleine from boarding at any of the brothels in Butte, where she would certainly fall into debt. === Reunion with Paul === Madeleine wrote to Paul to inform him that she had traveled to Butte to see him and he responded enthusiastically, inviting her to come to the remote mining town where he was working. Disgusted with the vice she saw in Butte, Madeleine was happy to leave, and the two were reunited two days later. Madeleine spent the summer exploring the little mining town, going horseback riding, and keeping Paul company. The people of the town, knowing nothing of her past, assumed that she was an Eastern schoolteacher. Although she and Paul butted heads over his desire to send her to college, these were happy days for Madeleine. === Return to Butte === After two months, Madeleine and Paul returned to Butte. To avoid scandal, the two lived in separate hotels, and Madeleine began to see Paul less. Eventually, she met another previous customer from Chicago and accepted his invitation to dinner, where he introduced her to poker. Thus began a gambling addiction that Madeleine would struggle with the rest of her life. Although Paul continued to support Madeleine, her gambling created a rift between the two of them. Unable to bring herself to continue asking Paul for money and unwilling to make money as a prostitute while the two were together, Madeleine left him and returned East. === Wandering === In her autobiography, Madeleine describes, \\"For the next three or four years I wandered over the face of the earth, always finding that the place I was in was the one place where I did not want to be.\\" She indicates that she traveled across not only America but also Europe, the Orient, Canada, and Mexico. Throughout her wanderings, she met fellow prostitutes of every sort. Paul continued to assist her in times of need, and her journeys ended when she returned for a year to live with him. During this year, she stopped gambling. == Canada == === Visit to Nona === When she was twenty eight years old, Madeleine heard that an old friend, Nona Blake, had opened a brothel in Calgary, and decided to visit for six weeks. However, Madeleine quickly grew tired with the monotony and bad weather that came with her friend's isolated location. She decided to cut her visit short and go to Banff, despite Nona's protests. === Madeleine's brothel === After spending a month in Banff, Madeleine resolved to stay in Canada and open a brothel of her own rather than returning to Paul. She subsequently traveled to Edmonton in search of a location to begin her new business. There, she learned of a town where the Mounted Police would allow a brothel to be opened so long as the owner didn't let the establishment become too conspicuous. Madeleine traveled to this town and met with both the commandant of the Mounted Police and the chief of the Municipal Police, who agreed to let her open a brothel as long as she maintained order. Despite protests from Paul, Madeleine bought an eight-room house, determined to become financially independent. After buying her house, Madeleine hired a Chinese boy, Fawn Kee, to work as a cook. He soon became a loyal friend and confidant. Madeleine then sent for three girls she knew from the United States, and she opened her brothel in late November. Upon its opening, the house was wildly successful and attracted men from all social classes of the town. Madeleine soon had to expand her business; she hired a pianist, more girls, and an assistant for Fawn Kee. She also added multiple rooms to the house. Madeleine's relationship with Paul suffered during this time, but her business remained successful. She became known as a \\"strict disciplinarian,\\" but was liked by many of her girls for her fair treatment. After two years in business, she hired a longtime acquaintance, Mildred, as a housekeeper. Madeleine was an adept businesswoman, and with help from both Mildred and Fawn Kee she dealt with political and legal scandals during her time as a brothel owner. === Alcoholism === After four years operating her brothel, Madeleine began secretly drinking to cope with insomnia and the stress of running her business. A new house that had opened nearby brought increased competition and increased attention to the prostitution in the town, which eventually entangled Madeleine in trouble with the Mounted Police. Under mounting pressure, Madeleine began a drinking spree that ended when Mildred encouraged her to take a vacation until she was well enough to run the house again. Madeleine left for Spokane, where she spent her money drinking and gambling. After losing a large sum of money and falling ill, she contacted Paul, who came for a week to support her. Following his visit, Madeleine spent the next four months traveling across the West Coast. When she returned to her brothel, she found that it was running smoothly thanks to Mildred and Fawn Kee. After two months back in Canada, however, Madeleine once again succumbed to alcoholism. A young doctor who served as the medical examiner for her house contacted Paul, who took Madeleine away and left the brothel under Mildred's care once again. Madeleine remained sober while she was with Paul, but their time was cut short when she heard rumors that he was engaged to another woman. Madeleine left him and returned to her brothel, where she continued to drink heavily. At age thirty four, Madeleine had been drinking heavily for two years. In deep despair, she went to visit a priest that had recently taken up residence in town. He prayed for Madeleine and told her to abstain from liquor for one year. Madeleine returned to her brothel, packed her things, and gave the house to Mildred, leaving the business behind her for the rest of her life. == References == Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Women autobiographers Category:Female prostitutes Category:20th-century American women writers Category:Year of death unknown Category:Pseudonymous women writers Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:American autobiographers ","title":"Madeleine Blair"},{"id":"60365076","text":"Noah is an unincorporated community in Jefferson County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. ==History== A post office called Noah was established in 1885, and remained in operation until 1908.

The film is directed by Graeme Ferguson == Synopsis == The film starts off by showing the rollout and assembly of NASA's first Space-worthy Shuttle, Columbia. This involves showing in high quality, Columbia, 'the world's first true spaceship' being rolled out of the Orbiter Processing Facility, and its assembly at the Vehicle Assembly Building. Columbia is then rolled out on the Mobile Launch Platform to Launch Complex 39A. Once on the launchpad Columbia throttled up the three SSME's during a static fire, to make sure they were in working order for the launch in April 1981. The documentary then follows John Young and Robert Crippen, who would be the Commander and Pilot for STS-1. Robert Crippen was rookie astronaut who had never been to space. John Young on the other hand, had been to space four times before. Two on Gemini and two times on missions to the moon, with one of them landing on the moon (Apollo 16). The documentary gives a nod to John Young's moon mission, which was where he was when he found out that the Space Shuttle Program had been approved. The next scene shows the press conferences John and Robert had to endure as there was a lot of worry about the safety of the mission, as this was the first time humans would fly on an untested vehicle. These included worries about the SRB's and the Space Shuttles thermal protection system. Another feature of the mission mentioned in Hail Columbia, is the escape system used by crew. As the Space Shuttle did not have a launch escape system, if anything were to go wrong on the pad, the crew would have to evacuate and use the slide wire, which was a zip line that took the crew from the Fixed Service Structure down to the surface, where the crew would either run to a bunker or climb into an M13 tank and drive away from the Shuttle. 18-minutes into the documentary, the launch of STS-1 happens. The high quality sound and footage follows Columbia to SRB separation before skipping to the external tank separating. On-orbit tasks are shown off, including the opening of the payload bays and inspecting non-critical tiles which were blown loose during the launch. High quality images of the Earth are then shown off, before Columbia prepares for the descent back to Earth. The very large crowds are shown off cheering as the sonic boom of the returning Shuttle is heard. Columbia then made a nominal landing at Edwards Air Force Base, where John and Robert left Columbia and greeted the waiting crowd, talking about how spectacular the mission was. The reusability of Columbia is mentioned before it is flown back to the Kennedy Space Center. The documentary fades out showing the launch of STS-2, nodding at the fact that Columbia was indeed a reusable SpaceShip. == Creating the Documentary == This documentary was unusual as it was made completely by a third party. Before hand NASA preferred to make their own documentary for scientific accuracy. Approval to fly an IMAX camera didn't end up happening until the Space Shuttle was deemed operational after STS-4. Taking a cue that the IMAX camera highly realistic experience would be able to make viewers feel like they were on the Space Shuttle, Graeme Ferguson lobbied NASA to fly an IMAX camera on the Space Shuttle. NASA was positive about the proposal as it would show off the STS program in a positive light and get the public excited. Hail Columbia was a big push to allow the IMAX camera to fly to space, due to how well the documentary had been made. The documentary was intended not to be a promotional piece for NASM, NASA, Lockheed or IMAX. The film was intended to be an educational and uplifting film about spaceflight. Following approval to fly into space in 1984, astronauts were trained how to use the camera, and it was finally flown into space on Space Shuttle Challenger on STS-41C. STS-41D (Space Shuttle Discovery) and STS-41G (Space Shuttle Challenger) were also featured in this to make the documentary, The Dream is Alive. == Release == The documentary was released in theatres on June 15, 1982. It wasn't released on disc until October 2001. The film is 37 minutes long and was the first of a string of IMAX documentaries featuring the Space Shuttle. == Impact on society == The documentary was designed to get people excited about space, particularly about the Space Shuttle which was meant to make space easily accessible and cheap for everyone. Ultimately, this never came to be due to a string of design flaws such as the Space Shuttle tiles which were damaged or broken on multiple flights including STS-1. Partially due to this, the Space Shuttle became too expensive to be a method for everyone to get to space. Despite this, due to the long life of the Shuttle, and help from IMAX documentaries, the Space Shuttle became a household name and children's favourite rocket for over three decades. == See also == * List of IMAX films ** The Dream is Alive ** Destiny in Space ** Mission to Mir ** Space Station 3D ** Hubble * List of Space Shuttle Missions ** STS-1 ** STS-2 ** STS-41C ** STS-29R ** STS-34R ** STS-63 ** STS-74 == References == Category:IMAX documentary films ","title":"Hail Columbia (film)"},{"id":"60365131","text":"Mark DeSimone was a member of the Arizona House of Representatives for a single term.

From 1907 to 1938 he worked in the photo studio d'Ora in Vienna, from 1921 as a partner of Dora Kallmus and from 1927 under the name d'Ora-Benda as the sole owner. ==Biography== Arthur Benda was an apprentice to photographer Nicola Perscheid from 1899 to 1902 and learned the techniques of colour photography and fine print. In an improvised photo lab in his parents' house, he deepened his practical knowledge, made his first colored rubber prints and experimented with the development of different shades. After completing his apprenticeship, he remained with Perscheid as laboratory manager and assistant.Barbara Boisits: Benda, Arthur. In Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon. Online edition, Vienna 2002 ff., ; Printed edition: Volume 1, Publisher of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 2002, . Signature on a d'Ora Benda photo In 1906, Arthur Benda met photographer Dora Kallmus, who also trained with Perscheid. When she opened the Atelier d'Ora on Wipplingerstrasse in Vienna in 1907, Benda became her assistant. The Atelier d'Ora specialized in portrait and fashion photography. Kallmus and Benda quickly made a name for themselves and soon supplied the most important magazines. The peak of renown was reached when Madame d'Ora photographed the present nobility in 1916 on the occasion of the coronation of Emperor Charles I as King of Hungary.Fritz Kempe (ed.): Documents of Photography 1: Nicola Perscheid, Arthur Benda, Madame d'Ora . Museum of Arts and Crafts Hamburg, Hamburg 1980. In 1921, Arthur Benda became a partner in Atelier d'Ora, which also ran a branch in Karlovy Vary during the season . In 1927 Arthur Benda took over the studio of Dora Kallmus, who had run a second studio in Paris since 1925, and continued it under the name d'Ora-Benda together with his wife Hanny Mittler. In addition to portraits, he mainly photographed nudes that made the new company name known in men's magazines worldwide. A major order from the King of Albania Zogu I, who had himself and his family photographed in 1937 for three weeks by Arthur Benda in Tirana secured Arthur Benda financially. In 1938 he opened a new studio at the K√§rntnerring in Vienna, which he continued to operate under his own name after the Second World War.Sabine Schnalenberg: Dora Kallmus and Arthur Benda: Insights into the Working Method of a Photographic Studio Between 1907 and 1938 .

Born Mary Ann Janisch in St. Paul, Minnesota, Feldman grew up in the Frogtown neighborhood of the city. Her parents were the proprietors of a small restaurant there.Ross, Jenna, She was educated at the University of Minnesota, where she studied journalism and music history and received a BA in 1954. While there she wrote music reviews for the Minnesota Daily under the pseudonym \\"V. I. Olin\\". In 1957 she completed her MA in musicology at Columbia University, which she had chosen for the opportunity to study with Paul Henry Lang. In 1983 she received a Ph. D. from the University of Minnesota, where she took as the subject of her dissertation George Putnam Upton; she had previously taught at the University for a number of years. In 1963 she began to work for the Minnesota Orchestra, where she would spend four decades working in the fields of music advising and public affairs. Among her many roles there, she edited the monthly program books; gave pre-concert lectures; aided in the establishments of the yearly Sommerfest; and assisted in documenting the organization's history. Her program notes were especially well-regarded, being described by one writer as \\"erudite and witty\\". From 1977 until 1981 Feldman was a member of the board of directors of the Music Critics Association; until 1986 she was the vice-president of the Metropolitan Opera for the Upper Midwest. Beginning in 1996 she worked for the Grand Teton Music Festival as a writer and speaker. Her interests during her career included such diverse topics as theories of music criticism; the history of music critics active in the Western United States; and the musical history of Minnesota. Her writing appeared in such outlets as Musical America, Opera News, the Minneapolis Star, and the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, as well as publications of the Schubert Club International Artists Series.

The neighborhood is bordered by the City of Youngstown, Ohio to the north and east, Glenwood Avenue to the west, and Forest Glen Estates Historic District to the south. Newport Village is known for its quaint tree-lined residential streets and early twentieth century Tudor revival and colonial revival architecture. ==History== First developed in the mid-1920s, Newport Village was one of Youngstown's first automobile oriented suburbs. The neighborhood mainly attracted the city's upper-middle class who was looking to move to quieter and more suburban neighborhoods outside of the City of Youngstown. Unlike Youngstown's previous middle class neighborhoods, Newport Village could not be accessed by streetcars, only by automobiles. Newport Realty Company, the developers of Newport Village, required all houses to be built in either tudor revival or colonial revival styles of architecture.Ohio SP Newport Village Allotment Historic District The layout of the neighborhood was heavily inspired by the 1922 \\"urban and parks design plan\\" designed by Massachusetts landscape architect, Warren H. Manning. Manning's efforts to expand Mill Creek Park into Boardman and to convince park leaders to create Lake Newport were essential to the development of Newport Village and its surrounding neighborhoods. A contributor to Newport Village's early success was the discriminatory housing policies of adjacent Forest Glen Estates, which prohibited first or second generation immigrants from purchasing houses. As a result, a large portion of Newport Village's original homeowners were wealthy immigrant families. In later decades, the neighborhood began to attract more commercial and residential development. For example, the corner of Market Street and Midlothian Boulevard was developed into a commercial center in the 1950s and is now home to strip malls, banks, and several apartment buildings. On the western side of the neighborhood, apartments were built along Glenwood Avenue and a new single family housing development was built on Stratford Road. In 2006, Newport Village became a part of the National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was placed in a small park on the corner of Market Street and Jennette Drive. Today, the neighborhood remains mostly middle class and is one of Boardman's most desirable neighborhoods. ==Types of Architecture== Newport Village is home to a variety of architectural styles. Jennette Drive, one of the oldest streets in the neighborhood, is known for its elaborate tudor style homes. Nearby Chester Drive is the only street in the neighborhood that contains duplexes. The majority of its houses were originally built as duplexes but were required to only have one front door in order to make them appear to be single family houses. The remainder of the streets in Newport Village are filled with single family colonial revival and tudor revival houses, mostly of modest sizes. Though most of the neighborhood is residential, there is a commercial corridor along Market Street. Originally, Newport Realty's design standards required all commercial buildings on Market Street to be built with brick, brick veneer, stone, or stucco. However, as time went on, these design standards were relaxed. Many of these commercial buildings were mixed-use and had apartment units or offices on the second floors. Some of the original tudor style commercial buildings can still be found on Market Street alongside 1950s-era strip malls. ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Ohio ","title":"Newport Village Historic District"},{"id":"60365472","text":"Jane Marriott (born 1976 in Doncaster, England) is a British diplomat.

Ladd was a pioneering giant in American and international consumer audio and video electronics. ==Biography== Ladd was the first of two sons born to Augusta Gertrude (n√©e Feiner) and David Ladd in Providence, Rhode Island on April 5, 1921. Raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Ladd died on July 7, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. ==Education and military career== Ladd graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in electrical engineering and earned an MBA from the Wharton School of Business. Howard's prowess as a businessman and interest in technology were further developed during his four years in the U.S. Navy during WWII. Among many engineering projects, he was integrally involved in the development of radio controlled target drone aircraft. Upon his release from active duty, Howard visited Los Angeles and moved there. ==Consumer electronics pioneer== The ten years after WWII saw Ladd actively involved in the formation of several businesses including a Southern California toy company. His great interest in technology led him back to electronics, setting him on the path to become a world business leader in the design and manufacturing of electronic equipment. ===Concord Electronics=== An image of a Concord Electronics D 300 Reel to Reel Reverse-A-Track portable tape recorder, circa 1965Ladd founded Concord Electronics, developing and marketing the first reel-to-reel and stereo audio compact cassette tape recorders that were sold in the U.S.. Most notably, in the 1960s, his Concord 5-inch reel-to-reel recorder was an entirely novel and innovative piece of electronic audio equipment. Ladd‚Äôs tape recorder became one of the most successful products in the electronics industry at that time. An image of a Concord Electronics F-20 Sound Camera Reel to Reel portable tape recorder, circa 1965In 1965, Concord offered the Concord F-20 \\"Sound Camera\\" tape recorder. The unit used 2.5-inch tape reels with a rim-drive tape transport. It could record 20 to 30 minutes of audio. The F-20 was featured several times during the opening sequence of the Mission Impossible television series between 1966 and 1973. By 1966, Concord offered 18 different models of reel-to-reel recorders.. For the next decade, Concord Electronics continued to innovate consumer recording products including the first portable, battery operated tape recorder with a built-in radio. Concord produced the Conrad NAV-1 Marine Navigation System, licensing the patented process from inventor Daniel I Schneiderman. Schneiderman was a Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist and was project manager of the Mars Mariner program and Ranger program. The device allowed boaters to quickly pinpoint their position and correct compass heading without using math. ===Early consumer video tape recording=== Ladd was a pioneer in producing personal video tape recording equipment. 1n 1966, Concord introduced the VTR-600 video system at the Los Angeles High Fidelity Music Show. The three- piece system included a video recording unit, a nine-inch monitor and a Concord video camera. Ladd said the system was designed to meet the needs of professional communicators and wasn't aimed at the home market. The system retailed for $1500 (). ===Concord Electronics sold=== In 1968, Ladd sold Concord Electronics to the New York based Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries, the exclusive US importer of Nikon photographic equipment. The transaction cost Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries 44,000 shares of their common shares of stock. Additional payments were to be made \\"on the basis of future earnings\\". Ladd remained with Concord as president for a year. Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries sold the Concord Electronics brand to Benjamin Electronic Sound Corp., a subsidiary of the New York based Instrument Systems Corporation in 1970. ===Sanyo and Fisher Electronics Corporation=== In 1969 Ladd became the Executive Vice President and COO of the Sanyo Corporation. Ladd introduced the Sanyo brand to the United States in 1970. In 1969, Fisher Electronics was acquired by Emerson Electric, who moved Fisher's manufacturing operations to Hong Kong due to high labor costs, but the company continued to suffer quality problems. Fisher's market share continued to drop precipitously. In the early 1970s, Sanyo stepped in, revamping production to increase Fisher product quality. The cooperation between Emerson and Sanyo continued until May 1975, when Sanyo, which still had no American manufacturing affiliate, engineered the transfer of several Fisher product lines to Japan and rehabilitated a Fisher speaker plant at Milroy, Pennsylvania. While 50-50 partners, Sanyo and Emerson were unable to resolve numerous differences of opinion in regard to Fisher. Finally, Emerson agreed to sell its share in Fisher to Sanyo. Sanyo purchased Fisher Electronics from Emerson in May 1977. Under Ladd‚Äôs leadership, the Fisher Corporation under Sanyo grew to be a multi-million dollar leader in the consumer electronics industry. The new, profitable Fisher Corporation moved its headquarters from New York to Ladd's Los Angeles. Ladd was named President and CEO of the combined Sanyo / Fisher Corporation in 1977, serving until 1987. In 1978, Ladd said his audio merchandising philosophy for Fisher audio equipment was \\"the right product at the right price at the right time. I know that sounds basic, but that's what we've been able to do\\". After a \\"broadening of product and technology philosophies\\", Ladd predicted \\"the remarkable turnaround\\" will see the \\"privately held subsidiary doing 100 million () in annual sales\\". Ladd was mistaken. The turnaround actually resulted in a return almost ten times greater then his prediction. An image of a Fisher MT-6225 Studio Standard Automatic Linear Motor Direct-Drive Turntable, circa 1977.Ladd's innovations at Fisher included the world's first linear motor, direct drive turntable, the Fisher MT 6225. It's unique drive system employed the turntable platter as the rotor of the motor. With no electrical connections to the rotor, there were no armature windings and all complicated electronic circuitry was in a stationary (non moving) position on a single PC board mounted under the platter on the turntable base. Ladd was instrumental at Sanyo in designing and promoting Fisher Quadraphonic sound audio equipment for the American market, producing 4-channel audio equipment in both SQ and Matrix formats. He said \\"we make all kinds of quadrasonic equipment because this is the business we're in... let the consumer buy the kind of software he prefers and we'll provide him the hardware to play it on\\". Sanyo also realized tremendous growth during Ladd's tenure in the 1970s; annual sales grew from $71.4 million () in 1972 to $855 million () in 1978. Growth in the video sector was slowed by Sanyo's ill-fated decision to adopt Sony's Betamax VCR format instead of Matsushita's VHS. Although initially successful, the Betamax eventually became all but obsolete. Sanyo avoided further damage by later switching to the VHS format. In 1986, Sanyo's U.S. affiliate merged with Fisher to become Sanyo Fisher (U.S.A.) Corporation (later renamed Sanyo Fisher Company). The mergers made the entire organization more efficient, but also resulted in the departure of certain key executives, including Ladd, who had first introduced the Sanyo name to the United States in the early 1970s. ===Active in \\"retirement\\"=== Ladd claimed he had retired at age 67, but he continued to stay active in many business opportunities. Ladd and his associates founded the National Mercantile Bancorp in Century City, California in 1982. Ladd served as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the company and the bank. Ladd had been a director of the company since 1983 and of the bank since 1982. Ladd owned 1.9% of the bank at the time of acquisition by First California Bank. In May 1986, Ladd founded Ladd Electronics, incorporating the company in Los Angeles, California. Ladd was granted US utility patent US4912457A for a \\"Detector and message annunciator device\\", described as \\"an apparatus for detecting the presence of people and generating an audio message and/or a video display directed to the person or persons whose presence has been detected\\". Ladd founded Concord Media Systems in 1991. That company was the Assignee for US Utility Patent 5355161, an \\"Identification system for broadcast program segments\\". The patent has been cited in numerous subsequent patent applications. Ladd was Chairman of the Board of Concord Technology Development, an information systems company, from 1991 to 1995. Projectavision, founded by Eugene Dolgoff in Westbury, New York was an early American producer of high image quality LCD projectors. Ladd joined the executive committee of the company in 1989 to ‚Äúhandle consumer marketing for the firm‚Äù. Ladd was an avid tennis player and lover of big band era music. ==Accolades== Ladd was inducted into the Consumer Electronics Industry Hall of Fame in October, 2006. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Providence, Rhode Island Category:American electrical engineers ","title":"Howard Ladd"},{"id":"60365498","text":"Fredlin \\"Fredinho\\" Mompremier (born 25 November 1996) is a Haitian footballer who plays as a forward for Sporting Kansas City II in the USL Championship.

S. Bodenheimer and Mme. Bodenheimer at the International Congress of Entomology in Madrid, 1935 Friedrich Simon Bodenheimer or Shimon Fritz Bodenheimer (Hebrew: ◊©◊û◊¢◊ï◊ü ◊§◊®◊ô◊• ◊ë◊ï◊ì◊†◊î◊ô◊ô◊û◊®‚Äé; 6 June 1897 ‚Äì 4 October 1959) was a German-born Israeli entomologist. He wrote two major works on the history of biology and is considered the founder of entomology in Israel. == Early life == Friedrich, Frederick, or Fritz was born in Cologne to a wealthy Jewish family: his father, Max Bodenheimer, was a prominent lawyer. He was educated in Greek, Latin, literature, arts, mathematics, natural history, and calligraphy. At 17 he wrote a study of Sappho. In 1914 he joined the University of Munich to study medicine but was interrupted by World War I where he served on the Eastern Front. He was influenced into entomology after coming across the works of Karl Escherich. He went to the University of Bonn for his Ph.D. on Tipula under Richard Hesse. == Israel == After experiencing anti-Semitism in Russia and Germany, Bodenheimer decided to move to Mandate Palestine in 1922. He studied the Coccoidea in Italy for six months and worked with Filippo Silvestri and Guido Grandi before moving to Palestine, and joined the new agricultural experimental station near Tel Aviv. When the Hebrew University opened in 1918, he was appointed head of the Institute of Zoology and Entomology. In 1923 he married Rachel, daughter of a Russian Zionist Menahem Ussishkin, and along with her examined pre-Linnean entomological works and wrote a history of entomology. In 1927 he researched Tamarisk manna in the Sinai desert, a possible source for the Biblical version, produced from insect honeydew. In 1936, Bodenheimer published The Biological Background of the Human Population Theory based on university lectures he gave in Tel Aviv. In his career as a professor of zoology over the next 25 years, he wrote more than 420 works. Three of his major works include Insects as Human Food(1951) The History of Biology, An Introduction (1958) and Animal and Man in Bible Lands (1956). His Materials for the History of Entomology until Linne was published by Wilhelm Junk in Berlin and copies of the book were burned by the Nazis. His manuscript on Citrus Entomology was saved and published after the war. He published an autobiography A Biologist in Israel in 1959. In the same year, he died in London from complications following an eye operation. ==Awards== In 1954, Bodenheimer was awarded the Israel Prize, in agriculture. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty Category:Israel Prize in agriculture recipients Category:Israeli biologists Category:Israeli entomologists Category:German Jews Category:German emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli zoologists Category:Scientists from Cologne Category:University of Bonn alumni Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Friedrich Simon Bodenheimer"},{"id":"60365605","text":"Govindagupta (fl. 4th-5th century) was a Gupta prince of ancient India. He was a son of Chandragupta II and Dhruvadevi, and a brother of Kumaragupta. Both Chandragupta and Kumaragupta held the Gupta thrones at different times. The Basarh clay seal of Govindagupta describes him as a Maharaja (\\"great king\\"), and the Mandsaur inscription of his son describes him as a powerful man who destroyed several kings. This has led some historians to theorize that Govindagupta also held the Gupta throne for a brief period. However, the general view among modern historians is that Govindagupta was never a sovereign ruler: he may have been a governor of the Tirabhukti province within the Gupta empire. == Sources of information == === Basarh clay seal === According to a clay seal discovered at Basarh, among the ruins of the ancient Vaishali city, Govindagupta was a son of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II and his wife Dhruva-devi. The clay seal names queen Dhruva-svamini (presumably same as Dhruva-devi) as the wife of Maharajadhiraja (\\"king of great kings\\") Chandragupta, and the mother of Maharaja (\\"great king\\") Govindagupta. In his Basarh clay seal, Govindagupta is styled Maharaja. No coins issued by Govindagupta have been found, and the Gupta genealogy does not mention him. === Mandsaur inscription === An inscription discovered in Mandsaur, issued by a son of Govindagupta, eulogizes Govindagupta. The inscription is dated to the year 467 CE of the Malava era (c. 467 CE). The inscription claims that the kings destroyed by him bowed their heads at his feet, and even Indra - the king of gods in Hindu mythology - was afraid of him. It states Govindagupta was as famous as the god Govinda (Vishnu), and resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi (in Hindu mythology, Diti is the mother of the Daityas or the demons, and Aditi is the mother of the gods; the poet apparently meant to compare Govindagupta to the demons in physical strength, and to the gods in spiritual virtues). === Deogarh inscription === An inscription discovered on a pillar in the courtyard of the Dashavatara Temple, Deogarh contains the phrase Keshavapura-svami-padaya Bhagavata Govindasya danam. Scholar V. S. Agarwala interprets this phrase to mean that the temple was commissioned by Govindagupta. == Political status == According to the official genealogy of the Gupta dynasty, Chandragupta II was succeeded by his son Kumaragupta. However, the Basarh clay seal describes the Gupta queen Dhruvasvamini as the mother of Maharaja Govindagupta, and does not mention her other son, Kumaragupta. It appears that Govindagupta was the governor of the Tira-bhukti province centered around Vaishali, where he and her mother lived. This may explain why in that area, the queen was known as the mother of Govindagupta rather than that of Kumaragupta. An alternative explanation is that Govindagupta may have been the heir apparent. Historian D. R. Bhandarkar interpreted the Basarh seal to theorize that Govindagupta was the heir apparent of Chandragupta, and ruled for a short period between 411 CE (the last known date of Chandragupta) and 414 CE (the earliest known date of Kumaragupta). Although Bhandarkar later gave up this theory, it was revived by other scholars after the discovery of the Mandsaur inscription. The inscription describes Govindagupta as a general who ruled in the past, and suggests that he was a powerful king. Historian B. P. Sinha theorizes that during the later years of Chandragupta, Govindagupta was transferred to Central India, where he was appointed as the governor of the western Malwa region. The various theories about his political status include: * Govindagupta was not an independent ruler: the eulogistic description contained in the Mandsaur inscription does not necessarily imply that he was a sovereign ruler. He may have held a high post, such as that of a governor, or may have acted as a regent during Kumaragupta's old age. * Govindagupta was the heir apparent, but he died before his father, because of which Kumaragupta - who was the next in line of succession - became the new king. * Historian S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar theorized that Kumaragupta was the heir apparent, and was originally assigned to govern Vaishali; however, in his absence, the post was assigned to Govindagupta, whose mother acted as a regent because he was a minor. * Govindagupta rebelled against Kumaragupta or his successor Skandagupta, and set up an independent kingdom for a brief period. For example, he may have seized the throne when Skandagupta left the capital to fight against the Hunas. Govindagupta's independent kingdom may have been located in the western Malwa region. * According to numismatist P. L. Gupta, Govindagupta succeeded his father on the throne, and may have been overthrown by his brother Kumaragupta. Chandragupta's last known date is the c. 412-413 CE (Gupta year 93) and Kumaragupta's last known date is 415 CE (Bilsad inscription of Gupta year 96). So, Govindagupta may have held the throne during 413-415 CE. * Bhandarkar later theorized that Govindagupta and Kumaragupta were two different names of the same king. This second theory was based on some of Kumaragupta's coins which bear a symbol that seems to read \\"go\\": according to Bhandarkar, \\"go\\" stands for Govindagupta. Historian R. C. Majumdar dismisses this as weak evidence, pointing out that this symbol also occurs on the coins of Narasimhagupta. The general view among modern historians is that Govindagupta was a younger brother of Kumaragupta: he was never the heir apparent, and did not ascend the Gupta throne. == References == === Bibliography === * * * Category:Gupta Empire Category:Indian empresses ","title":"Govindagupta"},{"id":"60365610","text":"Vincent Scott Skillings (born May 3, 1959) is a former American football cornerback in the Canadian Football League for the Montreal Alouettes and Montreal Concordes.

Based in Sydney, Bowman has won the New South Wales Metropolitan Jockey Premiership four times (2008/09, 2011/12, 2014/15, 2016/17) and has ridden 99 Group 1 winners. He was the jockey for Australian champion mare Winx from 2014 through to her retirement in 2019. In 2017, Bowman won the Longines World‚Äôs Best Jockey award presented by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities. The award capped off a year in which he added to his domestic success with international Group 1 wins in Hong Kong and Japan. In 2019, he was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame, the industry‚Äôs highest accolade. Bowman is also renowned for his ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Apples‚Äù winning salute and his nickname of ‚Äúthe Undisputed Group 1 King‚Äù. == Early Life == James Hugh Bowman was born on 14 July 1980 in Dunedoo, NSW. His family spent time on three different properties when he was child ‚Äì Cairn Hill, Burrgoen, before his parents decided to return to the family farm, Merotherie, in 1993. The same year, Bowman left to commence his secondary schooling, boarding at The Scots College in Sydney‚Äôs Eastern Suburbs. Growing up on cattle and sheep properties, Bowman has stated that horses were always an integral part of the working farm and a connection with them was formed early in his life. Bowman also comes from a lineage of horsemen. His grandfather, great uncle, father and uncle all rode as amateur jockeys. Bowman himself was a member of the local pony club until he was 15, riding in country shows and displaying natural horsemanship. He also grew up playing polocrosse, campdrafting and riding in picnic races. Bowman recalls being 13 when he decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a professional jockey. In 1997, he left school and secured an apprenticeship with trainer Leanne Aspros in Bathurst, where he was also mentored by her husband, Billy Aspros, who was 12-time champion jockey in the NSW Central Districts and a Group 1 winner (Turridu, 1995 George Main Stakes). == Career == On 3 April 1996, Bowman had his first official ride as an amateur jockey at the Mungery Picnic Races in Narromine, NSW aboard Go Campese. Later that year on October 5, he rode his first winner at Wellington, NSW when he guided Slatts to win the Wellington Picnic Cup. By the end of his first apprentice season in 1998, Bowman was the champion apprentice jockey in the NSW Central Districts. In 1999, Bowman moved to Sydney for the final two years of his apprenticeship under the tutelage of jockey-turned-trainer Ron Quinton, who also hailed from Dunedoo. He was crowned champion apprentice in Sydney for the 1999/2000 season. In the spring of 2001, Bowman won his maiden group race when he rode Sportsbrat to victory in the Group 3 Missile Stakes at Rosehill Gardens. His first Group 1 win came on Defier in the 2004 Doomben Cup in Brisbane. The following year, Bowman finished runner-up to Darren Beadman in the 2004/05 NSW Metropolitan Jockey Premiership (colloquially known as the Sydney Jockeys Premiership), the highest award for NSW-based jockeys. He then claimed his first premiership in the 2008/09 season riding 98 winners from 482 starts at a strike rate of 20.3%. Bowman has since won three more titles in 2011/12, 2014/15 and 2016/17. As his career entered the 2010s, Bowman developed a strong association with trainer Chris Waller. He would go on to ride many feature race victories on Waller's horses, most notably Winx. During his career, Bowman has ridden: Bowman riding Werther to a second place finish in the Takarazuka Kinen behind Mikki Rocket at Hanshin Racecourse * Exceed and Excel: 2003/04 Australian Champion Sprinter * Samantha Miss: 2008/09 Australian Champion Three-Year-Old Filly * Werther: 2015/16 Hong Kong Horse of the Year * Cheval Grand: 2017 Japan Cup Winner * Winx: 4-time Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year (2015/16 - 2018/19), World's Top-Ranked Turf Horse (2016, 2017), World's Best Racehorse (2018 - tied) === Winx === ==== 2014 ==== Winx had five different jockeys across her first 11 starts in 2014 and 2015, including Bowman. His involvement with Winx began during the Sydney Spring Racing Carnival in 2014. Bowman‚Äôs first ride on Winx came at her third career start, on September 6, in the Group 2 Furious Stakes at Royal Randwick. Winx won the race, making it 3 wins from 3 starts, while also registering her first feature race success. Two starts later, on October 4, Bowman would ride Winx to a second-place finish in the Group 1 Flight Stakes at Royal Randwick behind First Seal. ==== 2015 ==== Bowman did not ride Winx again until her twelfth career start during the Brisbane Winter Racing Carnival ‚Äì a victory in the Group 1 Queensland Oaks at Doomben Racecourse on May 30. This was Winx's first Group 1 success and the second triumph in what was to become her 33 consecutive race winning streak. Two starts later, after a 15-week spell and a return win in the Group 2 Theo Marks Stakes at Rosehill Gardens, Bowman was back aboard Winx steering the mare to victory in the Group 1 Epsom Handicap at Royal Randwick on October 3. From this race on, Bowman became the permanent jockey for Winx. He would have one more ride on the mare in 2015 when he travelled to Moonee Valley, Melbourne to ride her in the $3 million-dollar Group 1 W.S. Cox Plate ‚Äì the weight-for-age championship of Australia. Starting as the $4.60 favourite, Winx and Bowman went on to win the race by 4&¬æ lengths from Criterion and Irish galloper Highland Reel. The race was won in a record time of 2:02.98. ==== 2016 ==== Bowman guided Winx to victory in her return to racing on February 13 in the Group 2 Apollo Stakes at Royal Randwick. He would then pilot Winx to three consecutive Group 1 wins over the course of the Sydney Autumn Racing Carnival ‚Äì the Chipping Norton Stakes, George Ryder Stakes and the $3 million-dollar Doncaster Mile. After a 20-week spell, Winx returned in the spring on August 20 with Bowman steering her to victory in the Group 2 Warwick Stakes at Royal Randwick. Then one month later, just as in the autumn, Bowman would ride Winx to three consecutive Group 1 victories over the course of five weeks. Wins in the George Main Stakes and Caulfield Stakes culminated in Winx and Bowman winning their second W.S. Cox Plate in a row. The race was won by a record margin of 8 lengths. Bowman became only the tenth jockey to win the race back-to-back, while Winx became the tenth horse in history to win two successive Cox Plates. ==== 2017 ==== Bowman and Winx started off their 2017 autumn campaign in the exact same fashion as 2016 with a win in the Apollo Stakes at Royal Randwick on February 13. Wins in the Chipping Norton Stakes at Randwick and George Ryder Stakes at Rosehill followed on February 25 and March 18 respectively. While Winx and Bowman‚Äôs lead-up had been identical to the autumn of 2016, their end goal had shifted to the $4 million-dollar Group 1 Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The race is the premier weight-for-age race of the Sydney Autumn Carnival and the showpiece event of The Championships ‚Äì a two-day race meeting comprising the most lucrative races of the carnival, attracting horses from around the globe. Starting as the $1.12 short-priced favourite, Bowman guided Winx to a 5-length victory ahead of Hartnell and Sense of Occasion. The duo returned in the spring registering three wins in Sydney at Royal Randwick ‚Äì in the Warwick Stakes, Chelmsford Stakes and George Main Stakes ‚Äì before heading to Melbourne to attempt to win a third consecutive W.S. Cox Plate. On October 7, Bowman and Winx won the Group 1 Turnbull Stakes in her first career start at Flemington Racecourse. Three weeks later, on October 28, Bowman piloted Winx to her third W.S. Cox Plate win, breaking her previous race record set in 2015 with 2:02.94. Winx became only the second horse in history to win three straight Cox Plates after Kingston Town did it in 1980, ‚Äò81 and ‚Äô82. Likewise, Bowman was also only the second jockey to win three successive Cox Plates after Brent Thomson managed the feat from 1977-79 on three separate thoroughbreds ‚Äì Family of Man (‚Äô77), So Called (‚Äô78) and Dulcify (‚Äô79). ==== 2018 ==== Winx would only race three times in the Sydney Autumn Carnival of 2018, all at Group 1 level. Bowman would ride her to success in her third consecutive Chipping Norton and George Ryder Stakes before she once again won the Queen Elizabeth Stakes for a second straight year. Winx and Bowman returned in the spring on August 18 when they won the newly named and upgraded Group 1 Winx Stakes ‚Äì formerly the Group 2 Warwick Stakes, renamed in the mare‚Äôs honour. Winx became only the second horse in Australian racing history to win a race named in its honour after Black Caviar won the Black Caviar Lightning Stakes in 2013. Victories followed in the George Main Stakes and Turnbull Stakes, before Bowman and Winx won their fourth consecutive W.S. Cox Plate together on October 27. The duo were the first respective horse and jockey to win four successive Cox Plates. ==== 2019 ==== Winx and Bowman returned to racing, in what would be the mare‚Äôs final campaign, on February 16 with victory in the Apollo Stakes at Royal Randwick. Fourth successive Chipping Norton and George Ryder Stakes wins followed on March 2 and March 23 respectively. In their final race together, Bowman and Winx won their third consecutive Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Winx was officially retired after the race. Bowman and Winx‚Äôs partnership had produced 29 straight victories and 32 wins and 1 second placing from 33 starts together. === International Success === Bowman‚Äôs first international feature race success came in July 2007 when he won the Group 2 Superlative Stakes aboard Hatta Fort at Newmarket Racecourse in Newmarket, England. Bowman was in England as part of a three-month riding stint with trainer Mick Channon who was based at West Ilsley in Berkshire. In August, Bowman, as part of the ‚ÄúRest of the World‚Äù team, won the Shergar Cup at Ascot Racecourse ‚Äì a four-team competition where three jockeys represent their region with the winning team determined by their overall performance across six races. The four teams represented were Great Britain, Ireland, Europe and Rest of the World. In addition to winning the Shergar Cup, Bowman also received the Alistair Haggis Silver Saddle, the award given to the individual jockey who has accrued the most points in the competition. Bowman‚Äôs most successful year of international racing came in 2017. After securing his first two international Group 1 wins in 2016 aboard Werther in both the Hong Kong Derby (HK) and Queen Elizabeth II Cup (HK), Bowman would go on to win another four Group 1‚Äôs in 2017. Two of these victories were again on Werther in the Hong Kong Gold Cup (HK) and the Hong Kong Champions & Chater Cup (HK). Bowman won another Group 1 in Hong Kong when he rode Lucky Bubbles to success in the Chairman‚Äôs Sprint Prize (HK). His fourth win of the year came when he guided Cheval Grand to win the US$5.8 million-dollar Japan Cup (JP), the country‚Äôs most prominent race. As a result, Bowman won the 2017 Longines World‚Äôs Best Jockey award presented by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) ‚Äì the highest achievement for professional jockeys globally. The scoring for the award is based upon performances in the 100-highest rated Group 1 races internationally for that year, as established by the Longines World‚Äôs Best Racehorse Rankings Committee. Jockey‚Äôs accrue 12 points for first, 6 points for second and 4 points for third. Bowman‚Äôs four international Group 1‚Äôs, combined with Winx‚Äôs six Australian Group 1‚Äôs that year, provided 10 wins, along with 3 second placings and 1 third placing, giving him a total of 142 points. Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori finished second and third with 124 and 86 points respectively. Moore notched 5 wins and Dettori finished with 6.

It reached #12 on the U.S. R&B; chart and #16 on the U.S. pop chart in 1972. It was featured on their 1971 album All Day Music. This song is an unusual blues form with the first lines being repeated, in an African and Latin rhythm. The song deals with a friend, who's life was taken away from drunkeness, who withdraws from reality, having to pay the consequences. Because of the song's length in the album version, if 6:59, the Single radio edit version of 3:59,omits the slower introduction, plus the second verse of the song.

Early sources assumed that he was the son of a sculptor named Domenico Negri, but his father's name is given as Lunardo in some documents and Francesco in others. His first art lessons came from Matteo Ponzone. Later, he worked with Francesco Ruschi. In his early days, much of his work is difficult to distinguish, stylistically, from Antonio Zanchi. His first verified work is from 1658, when he signed an engraving on the frontispiece of Antioco by the poet, Nicol√≤ Minato. The paintings attributed to him, prior to the 1660s, are all missing. A painting of Antonio e Cleopatra is dated from c.1664. In 1670, he produced the Albero serafico dei Ordini francescani (Seraphic Tree of the Franciscans), currently at the basilica of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. One of his best known works is Nerone che esamina il corpo di Agrippina (Nero Examining the Corpse of Agrippina), in the collection of the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden.Fondazione Zeri He married Franceschina Maria Barbara, with whom he had two sons. She died shortly after giving birth to the second and he remarried in 1673, to Angela Caroli, the widow of a merchant. In 1673, he created what many consider to be his masterpiece; a monumental \\"telero\\" (canvas applied directly to a wall) depicting Mark the Evangelist and Saint Rocco, who interceded with the Virgin Mary to end a plague in Venice, on the left wall of the staircase at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, opposite a depiction of the plague of 1630, by Zanchi.Foto della tela su Atlante dell'arte italiana. He also took the occasional student; notably the Late Baroque painter, Simone Brentana. He died of what is believed to have been tuberculosis. He was interred, at his widow's expense, in the , which was demolished in 1873, after many years of serving as a mill. == References == == Further reading == * Alberto Craievich, \\"Un modelletto di Pietro Negri\\", in Arte in Friuli Arte a Trieste, XXIV (2005), pp. 21-24. * Giorgio Fossaluzza, \\"Annotazioni e aggiunte al catalogo di Pietro Negri, pittore ¬´del chiaro giorno alquanto inimico¬ª.

The plot centres around a prescription drug-addicted newlywed photographer (Sarah Jurgens) who appears to be stalked by a dark man in a brimmed hat who follows her from her nightmares into reality. Rachel is aided by William (Adam Tomlinson) who has been investigating the \\"Hat Man\\" phenomenon. ==Plot== Rachel Darwin, a pregnant woman going through a career crisis, has recurring dreams in which a shadow man wearing a fedora forcibly removes a deformed baby from her womb. Searching online, she discovers a world of night sufferers like herself, visited by watchers while they sleep. Her husband Scott believes that her experiences are hallucinations born from a subconscious still coping with his previous infidelity and a fear of childbirth. She seeks help and determines she is suffering from sleep paralysis. Troublingly, she also sees the \\"Hat Man\\" while awake, as a distorted blur in the background of a photograph, or a flicker in the corner of an eye. Rachel believes she may be being stalked by a malevolent supernatural entity. At her regular group therapy session for recovering addicts, Rachel shares her experience and befriends the only person who believes her, a strange man named William who claims to suffer from a similar sleep paralysis and visions. Rachel goes to William's apartment to learn more about his investigations into shadow people. His research has convinced him that multidimensional beings surround everyone, creatures who feed on human souls. Rachel is now even more terrified. She slips into an intoxicated dream confronted by horrors from her past. The nightmares get worse and Rachel begins to struggle as she slips between reality and nightmare. Scott takes her on a weekend getaway to an isolated winter cabin to take Rachel's mind off the Hat Man and rekindle their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, William examines photographs he secretly took of Rachel during group therapy and sees the Hat Man standing behind her. Rachel continues dreaming of the Hat Man at night and catching brief glimpses of him during the day. Frustrated with Rachel's aloofness and strange behaviour during her waking nightmares, a drunken Scott tries to rape her. Rachel knocks him out and returns to the city in their car. Rachel spends the night at William's. He shows her the pictures he took of her, but the Hat Man is not there. Rachel believes him; the same thing happens to photographs she has taken. Rachel and William have sex. He is sure that, with her help, he can put a stop the shadow figure. The next morning, Scott wakes and has his legal assistant Sally pick him up. Scott learns from the recovery group leader that Rachel was last seen with William. Scott bribes the group leader for William's address. William hypnotizes Rachel in an effort to explore her subconscious and confront the shadow man. Rachel once more has a vision of the Hat Man removing the baby from her womb. Rachel sees her childhood home, where the shadow man appears behind Rachel's mother after she kills herself in the bathtub. Rachel sees William's apartment and her own hypnotism session. William realizes that Rachel is astral projecting. She sees the Hat Man appear and kill William by supernatural means. Rachel stabs herself in order to wake up, and discovers William has indeed been killed. Arriving at William's during the attempt to fight the shadow man, Scott finds the door locked. The Hat Man attacks Rachel, who wrests his knife away and stabs him. He dissipates. Scott tries speaking with Rachel through the door, and she realizes that her belly is bleeding. The Hat Man reforms out of the shadows and stabs Rachel repeatedly to death. The door then unlocks on its own, and Scott discovers to his horror the two corpses. Scott is arrested for the murders. During questioning, Scott realizes that his wife was telling the truth when he sees the Hat Man materialize in a photograph as well as behind the interrogating detective. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Background and inspiration=== Adam Tomlinson first clarified what was meant by the \\"inspired by true events\\" tagline at the film's post-premiere question-and-answer session; that the core story is based on his personal experience of seeing \\"a hat man\\" and then discovering his nightmare sighting was a worldwide phenomenon. Tomlinson's fascination with shadow people began with a nightmare in which he was being followed by a man in a hat, and then awakening to find the man was in his bedroom, watching him. He actually forgot about it until a friend told him of a similar dream. Tomlinson then turned to the Internet, and found thousands of similar reports from around the globe: \\"No one really knows what they are ... You wake up from a dream and find a man in a hat standing over you or sitting on your bed and you're unable to move.\\" Tomlinson said shadow people first gained prominence in 1999 when Art Bell mentioned them on a radio show. More than 4,000 people responded with their own reports of encountering shadowy figures after waking. However, according to co-executive producer Brigitte Kingsley, \\"People through hundreds of years have seen this figure, or shadow person appearing in their dreams, causing sleep paralysis and sometimes seen in waking life as well\\". Estimates of how many people experience sleep paralysis vary from 5 percent to 60 percent; the scientific explanation for it is \\"a disconnect between body and mind\\" in which one becomes mentally aware before the body \\"wakes up\\" from its paralyzed state, potentially a terrifying experience, especially if, as frequently happens, these episodes are accompanied by hallucinations and the sensation of breathlessness. There may be a sense of an intruder: > shadow figures, malevolent watchers and the Man In the Hat. The Old > Testament is filled with stories of night terrors. In the Middle Ages, > people were visited by demons and incubus. The word \\"nightmare\\" refers to > the Scandinavian \\"mara\\", a spirit sent to torment or suffocate sleepers. ===Writing and characterization=== Tomlinson wrote much of the script while living with his parents in Grimsby, Ontario, and insisted on the factual basis of his story: \\"It's fiction based on real life ... Everything is based on fact. I think that's scarier because it's real.\\" The Man in the Shadows is the first full-length film Tomlinson has both written, co-produced, and starred in. His character is a Fox Mulder-like character \\"who walks the main character down the path of learning about shadow people.\\" The downward spiral the main character experiences was inspired by interrupting comments made by a homeless man who approached Tomlinson while talking to a friend about shadow people: the man approached him and said: \\"They will ruin your life and take all your money.\\" Those comments \\"set the tone for the journey the main character endures.\\" Sarah Jurgens is the actress who portrays that main character, Rachel Darwin, a photographer addicted to prescription drugs who begins to lose her sense of reality as she grapples with her broken marriage and her nightmares. According to Jurgens, the most challenging thing about this project was \\"arcing\\" the character's descent into delusion. > The Man In The Shadows gave me the permission to explore the experience of > being haunted, hunted and stalked ... I was given the opportunity to live in > a state of mental unraveling. I enjoyed the challenge of playing a character > who was wrestling with truth and illusion, experiencing the slippage of her > own sanity. ===Filming=== Joshua Fraiman's background in film was primarily as a cinematographer, with The Man in the Shadows representing his directorial debut. Principal photography took place over a tight twelve days in Toronto, Muskoka, and Port Perry. At least 50% of the material written into the original draft was cut. ==Release== The Man in the Shadows had its world premiere at the Dances with Films Festival in Los Angeles, on 1 June 2015, and its Canadian premiere at Cin√©fest Sudbury International Film Festival on 22 September 2015, where it was presented by Fraiman and Kingsley, who grew up in Sudbury and still has family there. The film was also chosen as an Official Selection of the 2015 Scare-A-Con Film Festival where Jurgens was nominated for a Best Actress Award, and the film nominated for a Best Feature Award. ===Home media and streaming=== The Man in the Shadows was expected to debut on iTunes in Canada some time in Spring 2016, and globally in June. The DVD was released in Canada on 16 December 2016, including special features, deleted scenes, and feature length audio commentary, the feature run time 88 minutes. In the UK, a DVD was released on 16 October 2017 from High Fliers Films. In the US, both DVD and VOD releases occurred on 31 October 2017 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The special features include deleted scenes and audio commentary by director Joshua Fraiman, writer Adam Tomlinson, and executive producer Andrew Cymek. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The Man in the Shadows received mostly negative reviews upon its release, with criticism directed towards the film's acting, and script. Critics also felt disappointed that the film failed to explore the real-life phenomenon which it was based on. Peter Hopkins of HorrorScreamsVideoVault stated that, while the film's story was intriguing, the result was \\"a boring plodding mess\\". Hopkins criticized the film for its drawn out scenes, and finale. Shannon McGrew from NightmarishConjurings was highly critical of the film, panning the film's acting, lack of chemistry from the film's leads, storyline, and script. McGrew concluded his review by writing, \\"If you want a film as background noise in which you don‚Äôt have to pay any attention to it, then check out The Shadow Man. However, if you want to save 89 minutes, I suggest watching something else.\\" Ian Sedensky of Culture Crypt gave the film a score of 45 out of 100, offering similar criticism towards the film's story, script, and lack of chemistry between the two leads. Sedensky also felt the film never fully explored the phenomenon which it was inspired by, and lacked sufficient depth to warrant any interest. ===Nominations=== *Scare-A-Con Film Festival ‚Ä¢ Best Feature ‚Ä¢ Best Actress ==Sequel== Tomlinson had already written the sequel by the time of the film's release; filming would depend on the success of the original. ==References* Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:2010s thriller films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films Category:Canadian horror thriller films Category:Canadian supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on urban legends ","title":"The Man in the Shadows"},{"id":"60366097","text":"Moses Bahelfer (1908-1995) was a Polish-born Jewish artist and graphic designer associated with the Bauhaus. == Early life and education == === Early life === Moshe Bagelferyches was born on June 29 in Vilnius, then part of the Russian Empire. He took up painting from at an early age, later going on to work as an apprentice at a local vocational school while taking classes at the Vilnius Academy of Arts. Bagelferyches also joined Yungvilno, a group formed by young Jewish artists in the city, who hosted exhibitions. === Bauhaus === Bagelferyches matriculated at the Bauhaus Dessau in 1928, after which he went by the name Moses Bahelfer. Because Bahelfer did not have the means to fully pay for his education at the school, he was provided with free meals and partial exemption from tuition fees. At the school, Bahelfer studied under Joost Schmidt, Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger, and Wassily Kandinsky. In 1932, Bahelfer married, Gitel Golde, a classmate at the Bauhaus. He graduated the same year and moved to Paris with his wife shortly thereafter. == Career in France == In Paris, Bahelfer (there known there by the surname Bagel) worked as a graphic designer, children's book illustrator, and photographer. Following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he joined the French Foreign Legion. During the German occupation of France, Bahelfer lived in Toulouse, where he aided the Resistance by forging identification documents. After the end of World War II, Bahelfer returned to France, working in set design and as an illustrator for various Yiddish publications. From 1947 to 1968, he worked in the design department at 20th Century Fox. Grave of Bahelfer at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery In 1959 UNESCO commissioned Bahelfer to produce a series of paintings commemorating Sholem Aleichem.

He is best known as The Bible Memory Man because of his unique ability to quote over 20 complete books of the Bible dramatically from memory, although he is often mischaracterized as having the entire Bible memorized. His book The Memorization Study Bible (2018) is published by Master Books and is the only Study Bible which specifically facilitates the memorization of the Bible, a popular spiritual exercise for many Evangelical Christians. ==Family and education== Meyer was born in Elmhurst, IL on Mother's Day, May 9, 1976 to Tom and Deborah (Whitehead) Meyer. He is the oldest of four children. From a young age, Meyer attended Grace Baptist Church of Lombard, IL. He became a Christian at that time. At the age of 26, Meyer decided to pursue higher education. He attended Shasta Bible College and Graduate School in Redding, CA to earn his B.A. in Bible and Theology (2002‚Äì2006). At this point, Meyer determined to pursue his Biblical Studies abroad. He moved to Jerusalem, Israel for four years (2006‚Äì2010), during which he became the only person in the Institute's history to earn two master's degrees (Geography & Archaeology of Israel and Middle Eastern Culture & Religion) from Jerusalem University College in Jerusalem, Israel. During his 1,000 day stay in the Holy Land and neighboring countries, Meyer had such adventures as speaking the Bible from memory to Prime Minister Shimon Peres, sailing the Nile River, climbing Mount Sinai and the Great Pyramid, sifting the ruins of the Temple Mount and meeting his future wife, not to mention seeing for himself the many locations made famous by the events of the Bible. On Christmas Eve 2009, Meyer was engaged to Sarah Oakes in Bethlehem and on the Day of Pentecost in 2011, he married Oakes at Christ Church in the Old City of Jerusalem. They have 4 children and live in Redding, CA. ==Career and ministry== After graduating from Willowbrook High School in 1994, Meyer worked for his family's business, Meyer Paving in Maple Park, IL. At age 26, Meyer left IL for college in CA, and shortly thereafter began to memorize and perform portions of the Bible as a one-man, Shakespearean routine to present the most famous book in the world in a whole new way. Circa 2003, he met Jason Nightingale, the now deceased founder of Wordsower Ministries International. Intrigued by the two-fold work of stateside dramatic Bible recitations as sermons and overseas mercy ministry to orphans and widows, Meyer joined Nightingale's company and began quoting the entire book of Revelation from memory. Meyer, called a throwback because he recites the Bible from heart like ancient Israelites did thousands of years ago, has since recited the Bible from memory in over 30 states, in front of actor and now friend Chuck Norris and the President of Israel. Meyer expanded to full-time public speaking in 2010, at which point he also began to teach at his alma mater, Shasta Bible College. Meyer has appeared in numerous American TV, newspaper, and radio interviews such as Fox News, Moody Radio, CBN, and The Christian Post, as well as being featured in International newspapers and radio shows in Uganda, London, the Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Vietnam, Portugal, Germany, and Spain. He is an annual guest speaker at the Answers in Genesis Creation Museum and tours the USA each summer with his family to give his powerful presentations from coast to coast and inspire Christians to memorize Scripture. Most recently Meyer has gained distinction for speaking out against attempts to link Biblical prophecy to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, in 2020 Meyer began a series of exclusive interviews with the Daily Express of London. Meyer was interviewed on archaeological subjects like the possible location of the Ark of the Covenant, the Merenptah Stele, the Copper Scroll the crossing of the Red Sea and a possible correlation between the early chapters of Genesis and archaeology, although his position on the latter was criticized by the Daily Beast. Meyer was also interviewed by the Daily Express on eschatological subjects like the timing of the Rapture, a chronology of Biblical end times, the location of Armageddon, and the identity of the AntiChrist. ==References== ==External links== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American male writers Category:21st-century Protestants Category:American evangelicals Category:American evangelists Category:Christians from California ","title":"Tom Meyer (Bible Memory Man)"},{"id":"60366117","text":"Cornick, also spelled kornik, is a Filipino deep-fried crunchy puffed corn nut snack.

As per Jain Cosmology, the universe is made up of Dravya, or substances, that are infinite in number but fall into six by categories. All substances have attributes that exist in all the parts and in all of the conditions or modes. In other words, attributes reside the substance. In addition to occupying the same space as the substance, attributes stay in the substance at all the time without any exception. Each substance has one unique attribute that distinguishes if from the other types of substances. The concepts of Gu·πáa (attributes) and Dravya (substances) are what differentiates Jain worldview from Buddhist worldview. The Jain worldview claims that real cause of all the phenomena in the universe is the attributive and substantive base of those phenomena whereas Buddhist Worldview denies the existence of attributive or substantive base for any of the phenomena in the universe. ==Types== While the number of possible gu·πáa is infinite, they can be categorized into two types: sƒÅmanya-gu·πáa (common/generic attributes) and vishesha-gu·πáa (special/specific attributes). SƒÅmanya-gu·πáa, or common/generic attributes, can be found generally in all substances. Examples of common attributes are: * Astitva - existence * Vastutva - functionality * Dravyatva - changeability * Prameyatva- knowability or knowableness * Agurulaghutva - constancy of individuality * Pradeshatva - shape formation or retentivity In contrast, vishesha-gu·πáa, or special/specific attributes, are not found in all types of substances but are exist only in its own substance. The following are examples, though not a complete list, of specific attributes for each dravya (substances): * Jƒ´va (soul) - consciousness, conduct, bliss * Pudgala (matter) - color, texture, odor, taste * Dharma (medium of motion) - motion-causation * Adharma (medium of rest) - stationariness-causation * ƒÄkƒÅ≈õa (space) - accommodation-causation * KƒÅla (time) - function-causation ==References== Category:Jain cosmology ","title":"Gu·πáa (Jainism)"},{"id":"60366170","text":"Wira may refer to: * WIRA, a radio station licensed to Fort Pierce, Florida, United States * Proton Wira, a car * Wira (film), a 2019 Malaysian film ","title":"Wira"},{"id":"60366174","text":"Guillecrinidae is a small family of echinoderms in the class Crinoidea, and contains the following genera and species below. ==Genera and species== * Guillecrinus Roux, 1985 ** Guillecrinus neocaledonicus Bourseau et al., 1991 ** Guillecrinus reunionensis Roux, 1985 * Vityazicrinus Mironov & Sorokina, 1998 ** Vityazicrinus petrachenkoi Mironov & Sorokina, 1998 ==References== Category:Echinoderm families Category:Articulata (Crinoidea) ","title":"Guillecrinidae"},{"id":"60366184","text":"Neocrinus is a genus of crinoids in the family Isocrinidae, and contains only two known species.

The term draws its name from the Four Heavenly Kings who rule over one of the heavenly realms in Buddhist cosmology. Like the Four Heavenly Kings in Buddhist mythology, each Buddhist teacher corresponds to one cardinal direction, based on where their organization is located in Taiwan. The corresponding institutions of the masters are referred to as the \\"Four Great Mountains\\". The four masters and their corresponding institutions are: :* North (Jinshan): Master Sheng-yen (ËÅñÂö¥, d. 2009) of Dharma Drum Mountain (Ê≥ïÈºìÂ±±) :* South (Dashu): Master Hsing Yun (ÊòüÈõ≤) of Fo Guang Shan (‰ΩõÂÖâÂ±±) :* East (Hualien): Master Cheng Yen (Ë≠âÂö¥) of the Tzu Chi Foundation (ÊÖàÊøüÂü∫ÈáëÊúÉ) :* West (Nantou): Master Wei Chueh (ÊÉüË¶∫, d. 2016) of Chung Tai Shan (‰∏≠Âè∞Â±±) == Sheng Yen == Master Sheng Yen (January 22, 1931 - February 3, 2009) was a Chinese Buddhist monk and religious scholar. He founded Dharma Drum Mountain, located at Jinshan District, New Taipei City, Taiwan in 1989. Dharma Drum Mountain focuses on educating the public in Buddhism with the goal of improving the world and establishing a \\"Pure Land on Earth\\" through Buddhist education. Born Chang Baokang near Shanghai in mainland China, he became a monk at the age of 13. During the Chinese Civil War, he left the monkhood and went to Taiwan in 1949 by enlisting in a unit of the Nationalist Army. After leaving the army Sheng Yen returned to monkhood and became recognized as a Dharma Heir in both the Linji and Caodong traditions. Sheng Yen was a 57th generational dharma heir of Linji Yixuan in the Linji school (Japanese: Rinzai) and a third-generation dharma heir of Hsu Yun. In the Caodong (Japanese: S≈çt≈ç) lineage, Sheng Yen was a 52nd-generation Dharma heir of Dongshan Liangjie (807-869), and a direct Dharma heir of Dongchu (1908‚Äì1977). Sheng Yen became a lecturer at Shan Dao Monastery in Taipei and then completed a master's degree (1971) and doctorate (1975) in Buddhist literature at Rissho University in Japan.Chronology of Master Sheng Yen, ddm.org.tw At the time Sheng Yen was the only major Buddhist figure in Taiwan to have earned a doctorate from a reputable foreign university. Sheng Yen became abbot of Nung Chan in Taiwan in 1978 and founder of the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Culture in New York City in 1979. In 1985, he founded the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Studies in Taipei and the International Cultural and Educational Foundation of Dharma Drum Mountain in 1989. Sheng Yen died from renal failure on February 3, 2009, while returning from National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. == Hsing Yun == upright=0.75 Master Hsing Yun (born on August 19, 1927) is a Chinese Buddhist monk. He founded the Fo Guang Shan monastery in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan in 1967. The monastery is the largest Buddhist temple in Taiwan and is the most comprehensive of the \\"Four Great Mountains\\". The organization follows Humanistic Buddhism, which focuses on using Buddhism to improve the current world, as well as promotes Chinese culture, Buddhist education and charity. The temple is known for its use of modern technology and teaching methods. Hsing Yun entered the monastic life at the age of 12 and learned about Buddhist modernism in 1945 while studying at Jiaoshan Buddhist College. He fled mainland China to Taiwan in 1949 following the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War but was arrested along with several other Buddhist monastics. Hsing Yun and the others were eventually released after three weeks and Hsing Yun spent the next several years developing a large following and founding numerous temples. In 1966, Hsing Yun bought some land in Kaohsiung and started building a large monastery. After partial completion, the temple opened in 1967 and would later become the headquarters of Fo Guang Shan. Fo Guang Shan entered mainland China in the early 21st century, focusing more on charity and Chinese cultural revival rather than Buddhist propagation in order to avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist Party, which opposes religion. Fo Guang Shan's presence in China increased under the premiership of General Secretary Xi Jingping after he started a program to revive traditional Chinese faiths. According to Hsing Yun, his goal in mainland China is to work with the mainland government to rebuild China's culture following the destruction of the Cultural Revolution, rather than promote Buddhism in the mainland. == Cheng Yen == upright=0.75 Master Cheng Yen (born 14 May 1937) is a Taiwanese Buddhist nun (bhikkhuni), teacher, and philanthropist. She was a direct student of Master Ying Shun, a major figure in the early development of Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan. She founded the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, ordinarily referred to as Tzu Chi in 1966. The organization later became one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world, and the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan. Although still Buddhist in nature, the organization focuses primarily on charity and humanitarian work rather than Buddhist propagation. Cheng Yen was born \\"Chin-Yun Wong\\" in 1937 in Kiyomizu Town, Taik≈ç District, Taich≈´ Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (modern- day Qingshui, Taichung City, Taiwan). Unlike the other Four Heavenly Kings, Cheng Yen was born in Taiwan rather than mainland China. Cheng-Yen grew up during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan during World War II. Upon deciding to become a nun, Cheng Yen ran away to a temple in 1960, but was brought back home after three days. She ran away from home a second time in 1961 and wandered with a Buddhist master for two years until she encountered Venerable Master Yin Shun, whom she asked to be her mentor so she can take official ordination. Master Yin Shun gave her the dharma name \\"Cheng Yen\\". In 1966, Cheng Yen went to hospital in Fenglin and learned that a Taiwanese aborigine woman had a miscarriage and died when the family could not afford the 8,000 New Taiwan dollar deposit. Later that year, Cheng Yen had a conversation with three Roman Catholic nuns at Pu Ming temple. While the nuns admitted the profundity of Buddhist teachings, they noted that the Catholic Church had helped people around the world by building schools and hospitals and inquired, \\"But what has Buddhism done for society?\\". These two events are credited with making Master Cheng Yen realize that Buddhism had to do more than simply encourage the private cultivation of people's souls. Master Cheng Yen established the Tzu Chi Foundation in 1966 as a group of thirty housewives who saved money to help needy families Tzu Chi expanded its work from helping needy families to medical aid in 1970. In 1986 Tzu Chi established its first Hospital in Hualien and gradually expanded its work to disaster relief and environmental protection. Tzu Chi is most well known for its work in disaster relief, one of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. == Wei Chueh == Master Wei Chueh, the founder of Chung Tai Chan Master Wei Chueh (1928 ‚Äì 8 April 2016) was a Chinese Buddhist monk. He founded the Chung Tai Shan Buddhist order in 1987, with its headquarters, the Chung Tai Chan Monastery in Nantou, Taiwan being completed in 2001. Chung Tai Shan emphasizes meditation practice to purify the mind and encourages people to join the monastic life. Wei Chueh was born in 1928 in Xikang (modern Sichuan), in mainland China. In 1963, he was ordained under Master Lin Yuan at the Shi Fan Da Jue Chan Monastery in Keelung, Taiwan. He received the higher ordination in 1967 at Daijue Temple in Keelung, Taiwan. He offered many retreats in Yilan, Hsinchu, and Hong Kong before settling into solitary seclusion at Yangmingshan near Wanli District, New Taipei. Master Wei Chueh became popular among people in the area in the 1980s for his meditation classes and retreats. In 1987, he founded Lin Quan Temple in Taipei County. Wei Chueh became known for organizing seven-day Zen retreats and dharma assemblies, as well as his \\"lively and flexible\\" preaching style. Due to the continuing growth of both lay disciples and monastic disciples, he founded the Chung Tai Chan Monastery in Nantou, Taiwan in September 2001. Chung Tai Shan is the least socially engaged of the major Buddhist organizations, emphasizing purifying one's own mind and religious study over charity or disaster relief. Master Wei Chueh died at the age of 88 on 8 April 2016. == See also == * Buddhism in Taiwan * Humanistic Buddhism == References == * Category:Buddhist organizations based in Taiwan Category:Taiwanese religious leaders Category:Religious service organizations ","title":"Four Heavenly Kings (Taiwan)"},{"id":"60366210","text":"Dream Empress (foaled March 22,2006 in Kentucky) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 2008 Alcibiades Stakes . ==Career== Dream Empress' first race was on July 17, 2008 at Ellis Park Race Course, where she finished 4th.

Other specimens were found off the coast of Bunbury, Western Australia at depths between 9 and 15 m (but these have since been identified as Aporometra wilsoni). Based on morphological evidence of four (somewhat degraded) specimens of A. paedophora (all paratypes), Helgen & Rouse believe that this may not be a separate species from Aporometra wilsoni. ==Description== Plate XLVII shows three types of pinnules: first, second and distal pinnules (Figs 4-6), and pentacrinoid larvae (Figs 7-9) from youngest to oldest. Fig 10 shows a cirrus. In the earliest free-swimming stage, the arms are about 7 mm long and have about nine pinnules on each side. This is a small species of crinoid with arms up to long. All Clark's large specimens carried pentacrinoid larvae attached to their pinnules. ==Distribution== This crinoid is endemic to temperate Australian waters, and apparently found only off the Manning River, in New South Wales. ==Ecology== The first specimens of Aporometra paedophora to be described were found clinging by their cirri to the pinnules and cirri of the crinoid, Ptilometra macronema. Crinoids are dioecious, with separate male and female individuals. They do not have true gonads, instead they produce gametes from genital canals found inside some of the pinnules. In most species, the sperm and eggs are released into the water column when the pinnules rupture. However, as with Aporometra wilsoni, older specimens of A. paedophora carry their larvae in their pinnules. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Articulata (Crinoidea) Category:Animals described in 1909 Category:Taxa named by Hubert Lyman Clark ","title":"Aporometra paedophora"},{"id":"60366278","text":"The Burnside Historic District, in Burnside, Kentucky, is a historic district containing four contributing buildings which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Peter Manifold and his brothers took up a sheep run around Batesford, occupying land both side of the Moorabool River. But after a few years looked to Victoria's western district for pasture. The Purrumbete property consisted of 100,000 acres, taking in the areas of Camperdown and Mount Leura. The Manifold Brothers (Thomas, John and Peter) bred sheep, cattle and horses. During the nineteenth century they were among the largest landholders in Victoria.

By tradition, he made the contribution in gratitude for divine intervention after a thunderstorm prevented British soldiers from destroying the foundry during the Burning of Washington. Foxall, who later served as mayor of Georgetown, was an associate of Francis Asbury, the founder of American Methodism, and became a lay preacher himself. A simple brick church was constructed at 14th and G Streets, Northwest, and Stephen G. Roszel became its first preacher, in 1815. The name \\"Foundry Chapel\\" was first used in 1816, and the community became an independent charge in 1817. President Abraham Lincoln attended a January 18, 1863 service at Foundry, where visiting Bishop Matthew Simpson, raising funds for missionary work, proposed that Lincoln be made a life director of the Methodist Missionary Society. His successor Andrew Johnson is also known to have attended. In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes became a member of the congregation, and he and his wife Lucy attended services regularly for the next four years. Lucy Webb Hayes was a devout Methodist and known for her support of the temperance movement, and later nicknamed \\"Lemonade Lucy\\" as she did not serve alcohol at White House events. In June 1872, the church purchased land at 15th and R Streets NW, which was developed into the Fifteenth Street Methodist Church. Foundry and the Fifteenth Street church merged in 1903. Around this time, the church leaders sought to build a bigger church, and acquired the current parcel on 16th Street NW. The new church opened for worship on February 28, 1904, and was dedicated on April 10 of that year. In 1924, Frederick Brown Harris was appointed pastor, a position he would have for more than 30 years, during which time he also served as the Chaplain of the Senate, and became the longest-serving holder of that title. Attendance reached an all-time high during World War II. Early in the American involvement in the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill attended a special interfaith service at Foundry on December 25, 1941. J. Philip Wogaman, previously of Wesley Theological Seminary, became senior minister in 1992. In 1993, Foundry welcomed President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton as members; the Clintons would attend services there about half the weekends they were in Washington. On June 7, 1995, the church voted to become a \\"Reconciling Ministry\\" for LGBT members, an effort which continued under Wogaman's successor, Dean Snyder. The church voted overwhelmingly in 2010 to allow same-sex marriages, placing it in conflict with the larger United Methodist Church. ==Music== Foundry is known for its strong music program, which includes a children's choir, contemporary choir, and the 55-voice Foundry Choir. The Foundry Choir was selected to lead the opening communion service of the 1984 UMC General Conference, marking the bicentennial of Methodism in America. The church organ is a Casavant of 3,364 pipes and 60 ranks installed as part of the church's 1984 renovation. A committee led by organist Eileen Guenther supervised its design and installation, choosing spots and voicing to reflect a focus on Classical and Romantic French literature. Guenther gave its first performance in February 1985. ==See also== * Sixteenth Street Historic District ==References== ==External link== * Category:1814 establishments in the United States Category:Churches completed in 1904 Category:Dupont Circle Category:Presidential churches in the United States Category:Religious organizations established in 1814 Category:United Methodist churches in Washington, D.C.

It grows in broadleaf evergreen swamp forests in southern Belize and adjacent Guatemala and Mexico. The wood is highly valuable, which has led to population loss from illegal logging. __TOC__ ==Description== It is a medium-sized tree, reaching 15‚Äì30 m in height and 91 cm in diameter. The bole tends to fork 6‚Äì8 m above the ground. == Habitat == Dalbergia stevensonii is found in seasonally and permanently flooded tropical evergreen broad-leaved lowland swamp forests. The rarity of this habitat limits the distribution of this species. It can be found in the Toledo district of Belize. In Honduras and Guatemala, it is found in broad- leaved forests; in Mexico, the species has been found in evergreen rainforests and oak forests. The population is likely to be shrinking from habitat loss and timber extraction. Information about the role of Dalbergia stevensonii in the wider forest ecosystem is very limited. Like other legumes, it fixes nitrogen, which is important for improving soil fertility. == Wood== 1798 sideboard with veneers including rosewood veneers Dalbergia stevensonii is known for its colorful wood. There is a clear border between sapwood and heartwood and distinct light and dark bands that form beautiful tree rings. The color of the surface is greyish and in the middle of the tree, it is pinkish or purple-brown. The wood is very heavy and durable; dry wood weighs on average 960 kg per cubic meter. Dalbergia stevensonii is regarded as a good material for musical instruments. It is used for making the bars of marimbas and xylophones. Due to its high density and toughness, it is a better choice than Brazilian rosewood. It is widely used in guitars, furniture, banjos, and sculptures. In Asia, it is used to make furniture and veneer. In Belize, it used to make small items such as bowls and woodcarvings. == Global market == Global demand for Dalbergia stevensonii is high and increasing. Since the tree is rare in the wild and does not grow very large, and only the inner heartwood is considered commercially valuable, wood production is very limited, adding to its value. It is used as a substitute for Brazilian rosewood, and the decreased trade volume of that species has also increased the demand for Dalbergia stevensonii. Dalbergia stevensonii is exported from Guatemala mainly to Japan, El Salvador, the USA, Germany, Belize and the Netherlands. As in the early 20th century, logging is a main economic activity in Belize. Belize banned the export of Dalbergia stevensonii in 1992 except for finished or half-finished products. In 1996, legislation was changed to allow the export of logs. The increased accessibility of its habitat and the decline in stocks of other rosewoods could lead to increasing logging of the species. ==Protection== Efforts to protect the species have not always been successful. Some workers trying to protect this species have even been killed in Guatemala. Illegal logging, including cross-border logging, is the most serious danger to Dalbergia stevensonii. It is difficult for governments to control the smuggling of Dalbergia stevensonii, and buyers may not know the real country of origin of the wood products. In addition, timber is often transported at night and there may be no official forest sector stamp. It may also be indirectly harmed by farm activities. One example is when farmers disregard the rule that new farms carved out from forest should leave a belt of 20 m of forest along the waterway. This is important to plants like Dalbergia stevensonii that are found near rivers. Belize has restricted the cutting of Dalbergia stevensonii and requires a license to do so, but there is not enough funding for environmental protection. In response to the widespread damage caused by the 2001 hurricane in the Toledo region of Belize, the Yaksak Conservation Trust established a tree-planting program focusing on planting seedlings of species that have historically been harvested, including Dalbergia stevensonii. Belize already protects 36% of its land area. == Artificial propagation == Dalbergia stevensonii has not been widely grown in plantations, despite its commercial suitability. For instance, tree stumps sprout freely, produce heartwood quickly, and with careful attention can produce valuable wood in a relatively short period of time. However, germination is difficult. A germination test in southern Belize in 2012 found tiny white caterpillars in most of the seeds. Very few seeds germinate and seedlings cannot survive for more than a few months. This may partially explain why there are no known plantations in Belize. In Guatemala, there are no data on acreage and plantation harvest. ==References== stevensonii ","title":"Dalbergia stevensonii"},{"id":"60366481","text":"Park Jeong-in (born 7 October 2000) is a South Korean football forward who plays for Ulsan Hyundai. ==References== Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:South Korean footballers Category:Ulsan Hyundai FC players Category:K League 1 players ","title":"Park Jeong-in"},{"id":"60366497","text":"Kalinichi () is a rural locality (a village) in Vereshchaginsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

The aircraft was controlled through ailerons on the inner portion of the trailing edges with pitch control through elevators outboard of the fins, situated at approximately ¬æ-span giving yaw control and stability. The undercarriage was of the mono-wheel type, common to many gliders, but with outrigger wheel struts in the lower fins keeping the aircraft level when on the ground. ==Operational history== To validate the design a 10% scale model was attached to a THK-5 and used as a flying wind tunnel, to validate the design values. The THK-13 was initially planned to have a small piston engine or turbojet, but was completed as a glider, principally launched by aero-tow behind a Focke-Wulf Fw 44. The first flight took place in mid 1948, flown by Kadri Kavuk√ßu, lasting for around 30 minutes. Modifications were carried out before the next flight in August 1948, flown by Cemal Uygun. The aircraft took-off , but at the right wing dropped, caused by a control restriction, so Uygun carried out an emergency landing, with the aircraft suffering some damage. Repairs were carried out and flight tests resumed, revealing poor yaw stability and heavy rudder forces. The rudders were reduced in area shortly before the THK-13 was exhibited at the 1949 Paris Air Show. Further development of the THK-13 was abandoned when THK's priorities were re-aligned. ==Specifications (THK-13) == ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *photographs * Category:1940s Turkish civil aircraft Category:Flying wings Category:Glider aircraft ","title":"THK-13"},{"id":"60366522","text":"Kozhevniki () is a rural locality (a village) in Vereshchaginsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

He worked at the La Plata Museum. ==Early life == Karl was born in Munich to Christian Bruch. Christian ran a printing shop which he sold in 1887 and the family moved to Argentina to work with a South American Banknote Company in Buenos Aires. Karl, now Carlos, joined the Museum of La Plata which needed a photographic and printing assistant under Francisco P. Moreno. From 1888 to 1891, Christian and Carl helped set up the press in the Museum that allowed Moreno to produce scientific publications with photolithographic illustrations. ==Argentina== Bruch was interested in insects from a young age. Bruch made several collecting and documenting expeditions, on the Chile border in 1894 followed by trips to Paraguay, Santa Feco Chaco, the sierras of C√≥rdoba, San Luis, Tandil and Ventana. In 1900, following the retirement of Fernando Lahille, Bruch became the head of zoology in the museum. In 1906 the museum was incorporated into the National University of La Plata and he was made a Professor of Zoology. He described a number of beetles and Hymenoptera. He was given an honorary doctorate in 1913. He donated his collection of nearly 50000 insect specimens to the La Plata Museum. He sent duplicate specimens to other entomologists around the world, and he is honoured in about 380 species including the genera Brucheiser, Bruchiana, Bruchomyia, Bruchiola, Bruchopria, Bruchomymar, Bruchaphodius, Bruchia, and Carlobruchia. ==References== ==External links == * Bibliography Category:Argentine entomologists ","title":"Carlos Bruch"},{"id":"60366526","text":"Krutiki () is a rural locality (a village) in Vereshchaginsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Neurology 59: 1105-1107 It is also known as Nasu‚ÄìHakola disease. ==Signs and symptoms== Four stages are recognised in this condition. The first (latent stage) show no symptoms or signs. This stage typically lasts up to the early 20s. This is followed by the osseous stage. This is characterised by recurrent bone pain usually affecting the long bones of the limbs. This is usually followed by pathological fractures of these bones. The third stage (early neurological) is marked by the onset of symptoms typical of a frontal lobe syndrome (euphoria, lack of concentration, loss of judgment and social inhibitions) with memory loss. Epilepsy may occur. This stage usually has its onset in the late 20s and early 30s. The final stage is characterised by severe dementia and paralysis. Death usually occurs in the late 40s or early 50s. ==Genetics== This condition has been associated with mutations in the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein (TYROBP) gene and in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene. TYROBP is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.12) and TREM2 is located on short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.1). ==Pathopysiology== This is not understood but appears to involve the microglia. ==Diagnosis== This syndrome may be suspected on clinical grounds. The diagnosis is established by sequencing the TYROBP and TREM2 genes. ===Differential diagnosis=== * Frontotemporal dementia ===Investigations=== X rays show the presence of bone cysts and osteoporosis. CT or MRI of the brain show loss of tissue in the frontotemporal lobes of the brain. Calcification of the basal ganglia is common. EEG is typically normal initially but diffuse slowing and irritative activity later. ==Treatment== There is no specific treatment for this condition.

It is a consortium of three major infrastructure companies engaged in the operation and maintenance of the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 (Line 1) since September 2015. The consortium is composed of Metro Pacific Light Rail Corp., a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation, AC Infrastructure Holdings Corp. (a subsidiary of Ayala Corporation), Sumitomo Corporation, and Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings (Philippines) Pte. Ltd. On May 29, 2020, the Sumitomo Corporation has acquired a 34.9 % stake of the company from the Metro Pacific Investments Corporation. https://business.inquirer.net/298579/sumitomo-buys-34-9-of-mpics- railway-business/amp ==History== The privatization of the entire maintenance and operation of the Manila Light Rail Transit Line 1 was the first infrastructure project under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) program of the Benigno Aquino III administration announced by the Department of Transportation in May 2011. The project's objectives were to attract billions of pesos of investments from the private sector in order to improve the system's severely deteriorated condition, as well as to relieve the government of its obligation to spend more than in annual subsidies just to keep the fares within reach of commuters. The company was granted the concession in October 2014 and took over the Line 1 operations from the state-owned Light Rail Transit Authority on September 12, 2015. Under the 32-year concession agreement with the Department of Transportation and Light Rail Transit Authority, the company is mandated to carry out the rehabilitation of 11 substations of the Line 1 as well as to provide 100 new train coaches to the system. The concession also includes the South Extension Project or Cavite Extension Project of the Line 1 to Niog station in Cavite which officially begun construction on May 7, 2019 after several years of delay due to right- of-way issues as well as the north extension to the North Avenue Grand Central station in Quezon City whose exact location was settled in 2016 and which broke ground in September 2017. Light Rail Manila Corporation's parent companies Metro Pacific Investments Corp. and Ayala Corp. have earlier been awarded the tap-and-go fare payment system project for all three rail transit lines in Metro Manila, the Beep smart card rolled out in July 2015 through another joint venture in AF Payments Incorporated, as well as the automated fare collection system project which was rolled out in December 2015. The company is also bidding for the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2 (Line 2) PPP and the North-South Railway Project of the Philippine National Railways which includes the rehabilitation and operation of the Tutuban-Legazpi line. ==References== ==External links== * Official website of Light Rail Manila Corporation Category:Companies based in Pasay Category:Rail transportation in Metro Manila Category:Department of Transportation (Philippines) Category:Transportation companies of the Philippines Category:Philippine companies established in 2014 ","title":"Light Rail Manila Corporation"},{"id":"60367071","text":"Bernard Salick (born 1939) is an American nephrologist and medical entrepreneur known for his contributions to comprehensive disease-state management and his efforts to reduce the costs of cancer treatment. He is the founder and former CEO and Chairman of Salick Health Care, a national disease management company in the United States. While leading the company, Salick created a managed care subsidiary, the first to offer fixed-price insurance products for the treatment of catastrophic diseases such as cancer and end- stage renal disease. Since 2016, Salick serves as a Professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. ==Early life and education== Salick was born in New York City in 1939. He graduated from Queens College with a BS degree in 1960, then studied medicine at the University of Southern California, where he earned his M.D. in 1964. ==Career== Salick completed an internship and residency in Internal Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellowship in Nephrology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the University of California, Los Angeles. After starting his nephrology practice in Beverly Hills, Salick opened a chain of dialysis clinics in 1972. He was elected to the board of trustees for the Hereditary Disease Foundation in 1975, where he served until 1985. He was also a member of the National Advisory Board for the National Kidney Foundation from 1988 to 1990. In 1975, Salick sold his dialysis chain to Damon Corp. In 1983, he bought it back and founded a new company called Salick Health Care. He decided to start a new chain of outpatient cancer care clinics when his 6-year-old daughter was diagnosed with a sarcoma. He opened his first cancer center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in 1985. By 1989, the company operated seven cancer care centers in partnership with major non-profit teaching hospitals including Temple University Hospital. In the 1990s, the company expanded to a chain of 11 outpatient comprehensive cancer centers, 8 breast cancer treatment centers as well as multiple dialysis centers in Southern California, Florida, Philadelphia and New York. Salick Health Care went public in March 1985 raising $18 million, and another $30 million in 1986 through a bond offering. In 1995, the company sold 50 percent of its shares to Zeneca Group (now AstraZeneca) which eventually acquired Salick Health Care in 1997 in a deal worth $450 million. In 1997, Salick started Bentley Health Care providing diagnostic and therapeutic services to patients suffering from chronic, catastrophic illnesses such as cancer, end- stage renal disease, and AIDS. He went into partnership with Montefiore Medical Center and Mount Sinai Medical Center to open outpatient cancer clinics and HIV/AIDS centers in New York and Florida. In April 1997, Salick donated $4.5 million to Queens College to create a new molecular biology research institute focusing initially on HIV/AIDS and hired Professor Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus to join as its first endowed chair. Dr. Salick demanded and received the return of $3 million of his gift from the school when it failed to meet the conditions that had been attached to the gift. In 2006, Salick founded Salick Cardiovascular Centers to provide diagnostic and treatment services for cardiovascular disease. He is currently working on the development of a nationwide program of Comprehensive Diabetes Centers. ==Other activities== In 2004, Salick established the Bernard and Gloria Salick Fellowship in Public Health at Harvard School of Public Health to provide annual scholarships for students pursuing careers in comprehensive disease management in catastrophic illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. He was a member of the Visiting Committee and the Leadership Council of the Harvard School of Public Health. In 2005, he served on the Harvard Business School panel for Healthcare Innovation and Opportunities in Southeast Asia and was a member of its Healthcare Initiative Advisory Board and the Centennial Committee in 2008.' From 2005 to 2007, Salick served on the Board of Directors of Nephros, Inc. and in addition, he served as a member of the Board of Trustees for the United States Equestrian Team Foundation from 1991 to 2011. He has also served on the board of the Queens College Foundation, and Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica. Salick's horse ranch in Hidden Valley, California, was offered for sale in 2002 for $50 million. The same property was offered for sale in 2016 for $32 million. Salick partnered with David Geffen to develop a 4-story 175,000 square foot luxury office building in Beverly Hills, California, which was sold in 2005 for $71 million to Tishman Speyer Properties. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American people of Romanian-Jewish descent Category:American nephrologists Category:American businesspeople Category:Queens College, City University of New York alumni Category:University of Southern California alumni Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty Category:American philanthropists Category:Physicians from New York City Category:Physicians from California Category:1939 births ","title":"Bernard Salick"},{"id":"60367088","text":"Oskar Cassel (4 June 1849 ‚Äì 8 August 1923) was a German liberal politician, a member of the Prussian House of Representatives and the Prussian constitutional assembly. Cassel was the first Jewish honorary citizen of Berlin and a leading figure in several Jewish-German organisations. ==Biography== Cassel was born in Schwetz, West Prussia, Kingdom of Prussia (≈öwiecie, Poland) to Aaron Cassel (1817-1896) and Therese n√©e Kristeller. His father was the rabbi of the Jewish community of Schwetz, he moved to Konitz (Chojnice) in 1850 and Flatow (Z≈Çot√≥w) in 1854. From 1858 on the family lived in Schwerin an der Warthe (Skwierzyna) and moved to Berlin in 1871.

He was elected a member of the Berlin town council in 1888 and member of the Prussian House of Representatives in 1903, where he became a leading advocate of Jewish affairs. On 20 January 1914 Cassel was the first Jew ever to receive the honorary citizenship of Berlin. In 1901 Cassel was a co-founder of the \\"Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden\\" (benevolent society of German Jews) and chairman of the \\"Verband der deutschen Juden\\" (Association of German Jews) in 1917. Representing the \\"Verband der deutschen Juden\\" Cassel protested against the Judenz√§hlung, the census of Jewish soldiers in the German Army, in 1916 and tried to convince the newly appointed Prussian minister of war Hermann von Stein to publicly restore the honour of Jewish soldiers. Stein, however, only assured Cassel that \\"the behaviour of Jewish soldiers and fellow citizens during the war gave nocause for the order by my predecessor, and thus cannot be connected with it\\". After World War I Cassel represented the German Democratic Party in the Prussian constitutional assembly. Cassel died in Berlin and was buried in an honorary grave at the Jewish Wei√üensee cemetery. ==References== Category:1849 births Category:1923 deaths Category:People from ≈öwiecie Category:People from West Prussia Category:German Jews Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:Progressive People's Party (Germany) politicians Category:German Democratic Party politicians Category:Free-minded People's Party (Germany) politicians Category:Members of the Prussian House of Representatives ","title":"Oskar Cassel"},{"id":"60367101","text":"CHIR99021 is a chemical compound which acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme GSK-3.

He was the house cartographer of Fortune and a consultant at Life for almost two decades. He played a key role in \\"challenging cartographic perspectives and attempting to change spatial thinking on the everyday level during America‚Äôs rise to superpower status\\". == Biography == Richard Edes Harrison's father was the biologist Ross Granville Harrison. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1901. He spent his youth in New Haven and went to Yale College where he graduated with a major in zoology and a minor in chemistry. He worked for a time as a draftsman, working for the architect Cass Gilbert and decided to become an architect himself. To this effect, he went to the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1926 and spent four years there. Yet, in 1930, during the Great Depression, employment prospects for architects were not good so he made a living by working as a designer. Harrison came to cartography \\"by chance\\" in 1932 when a friend asked him to momentarily replace a mapmaker working for Fortune. During World War II, his cartographic visualizations became very popular. He challenged the traditional Mercator projections, which are Euro-centric and East‚ÄìWest minded. His World representation using an azimuthal projection that was first published by Fortune in August 1941 under the title \\"The World Divided\\" became highly popular and was widely copied. He wanted to illustrate that \\"the entire conflict pivots around the U.S\\". A latter version entitled \\"One World, One War\\" was published on Fortune in March 1942. The US Army ordered 18000 copies of it. It displayed United States as a pivotal element of the World War, displaying how close it was to Nazi Germany occupied territories. The design of the United Nations logo was influenced by his azimuthal projection. Harrison soon became a freelance cartographer for Fortune and Time. He was from 1936 to 1938 on the staff of Fortune. He worked from the 1940s to the 1950s as a map consultant at the State Department, and was also employed by the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the CIA and the Museum of Modern Art. He lectured at Clark, Syracuse, Columbia and Trinity Universities. He was a member of the American Geographical Society and the Royal Geographical Society. == Publications == * == Links == * Harrisons's maps and diagrams published in Fortune * Cornell University Library, digital collections : works by Richard Edes Harrison == References == Category:People from Baltimore Category:1901 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American cartographers Category:Yale College alumni ","title":"Richard Edes Harrison"},{"id":"60367160","text":"Putino () is the name of several rural localities in Russia: *Putino (passing loop), a passing loop in Vereshchaginsky District, Perm Krai *Putino (selo), a selo in Vereshchaginsky District ","title":"Putino"},{"id":"60367199","text":"Peder Nissen (born 22 December 1976) was a former Danish badminton player.

It was produced by the Vitagraph Company, a leading early film studio. Relating five different events in Moses' life, it lasted five reels. It met great resistance from movie theater owners, who preferred shorter films that allowed them to change their audience much faster.

The film was made on 14 December 1970 on West 61st Street in Manhattan, New York City, though the couple did not have permits to work in the United States at that time. The film was based on Ono's earlier script Film No. 12 (Up Your Legs Forever). The earlier script was also known as Film No. 12 (Esstacy). The script reads \\"The camera work of the film should constantly go up, up, up, non-stop. Collect 367 pairs of legs and just go up the legs (from toes to the end of thighs) pair after pair and go on up until you run through the whole 367\\". The participants in the film were paid $1 each for their appearance, and each received a black and white instant photograph of them taken by Lennon. The writer Jonathan Cott in his 2013 book Days That I'll Remember: Spending Time With John Lennon & Yoko Ono wrote that Ono told him that \\"We can't have peace until we expose ourselves to each other. After you communicate like that then maybe we can have peace. And everyone who's in the film, including you, will be a star\\". The film was made for a three evening series of films by Lennon and Ono at New York City's Elgin Theater. Notable participants in the film included filmmaker Shirley Clarke, singer David Johansen, writer Paul Krassner, lawyer Allen Klein, artist Peter Max, model Taylor Mead, critic Jonas Mekas, filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, artist Larry Rivers, artist George Segal, film director Jack Smith and writer Tom Wolfe. ==Plot== The film depicts panning shots of 367 human legs from foot to thigh. The film is 70 minutes in length and ends with a shot of Lennon and Ono's buttocks. The soundtrack for the film consists of comments made during filming. The film's credits are read out by Lennon. ==Reception== In his 1995 book Screen Writings: Texts and Scripts from Independent Films, Scott MacDonald describes Up Your Legs Forever as \\"less impressive\\" than other film script adaptations by Ono as it does not advance beyond her \\"remarkable previous feature No. 4 Bottoms, which focuses on buttocks rather than legs\\". ==References== Category:1971 films Category:Films directed by John Lennon Category:Films directed by Yoko Ono Category:American avant-garde and experimental films Category:American films ","title":"Up Your Legs Forever"},{"id":"60367470","text":"P√©ter P√°los (born 1985) is a Hungarian para table tennis player who has an intellectual impairment.

She grew up in Scheveningen. Her father Moritz Rosenheimer was a German-born commercial agent, while her mother, Constance Fight, was a Dutchwoman born in England, and who preferred to speak English with the family. Rosenheimer grew up speaking Yiddish, Dutch, German and English. In 1933, she married David Simons, with whom she had a son. Trained in classical piano under Paul Frenkel in Holland, Jan Smeterlin in London and Paul Loyonnet in Paris, she established herself as a concert pianist under her maiden name. Her debut was in Antwerp's Cercle Musical Juif. Soon she was a soloist with the main ensembles in the Netherlands, including the Concertgebouw orchestra. When the Germans occupied the Netherlands during the Second World War, she was banned from performing. Along with her family, she was sent to Westerbork transit camp, where she played for the inmates in a series of undercover performances. In 1944, they were moved to the Terezin death camp. In 1945, Heinrich Himmler swapped several hundred interned Jewish people for munitions. Simons and her family were some of the fortunate ones. They were allowed to go to Switzerland. After the war, they returned to the Netherlands. Post-war, Simons' first musical performance was with Sam Swaap. She undertook a musical tour of the United States, but, physically weakened by her wartime experiences, decided to give up her musical career. She published a collection of poems Wrange oogst in 1946, and short stories Slijk en sterren in 1956 under the name of Clara Serena van Berchem. These were not publicised widely in the press. In 1959, under the name Ida Simons, she published Een dwaze maagd (A Foolish Virgin), a semi-autobiographical novel, which became a bestseller. Her wit and delicate cynicism were praised. Though she was known to be in poor health, her death on 27 June 1960 was unexpected. She was buried at the Jewish cemetery on the Oude Scheveningseweg. Posthumously, her novel Als water in de woestijn appeared in 1961. ==Selected works== ===Poetry=== * * ===Prose=== * * (English translation published by Maclehose in 2016) * == References == Category:People from Antwerp Category:1911 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Dutch novelists Category:Dutch poets Category:Dutch pianists Category:Holocaust survivors Category:20th-century Dutch women writers ","title":"Ida Simons"},{"id":"60367555","text":"An opioid epidemic is the overuse or misuse of addictive opioid drugs with significant medical, social and economic consequences, including overdose deaths. Opioids are a diverse class of moderately strong painkillers, including oxycodone (commonly sold under the trade names OxyContin and Percocet), hydrocodone (Vicodin, Norco) and a very strong painkiller, fentanyl, which is synthesized to resemble other opiates such as opium-derived morphine and heroin. The potency and availability of these substances, despite their high risk of addiction and overdose, have made them popular both as medical treatments and as recreational drugs. Due to their sedative effects on the part of the brain which regulates breathing, the respiratory center of the medulla oblongata, opioids in high doses present the potential for respiratory depression and may cause respiratory failure and death. Opioids are effective for treating acute pain, but are less useful for treating chronic (long term) pain, as the risks often outweigh the benefits. == United States == Number of yearly U.S. opioid overdose deaths from all opioid drugs From 1999 to 2016 it is estimated 453,300 Americans have died from opiods. What the U.S. Surgeon General dubbed \\"The Opioid Crisis\\" likely began with over-prescription of opioids in the 1990s, which led to them becoming the most prescribed class of medications in the United States. Opioids initiated for post surgery or pain management are one of the leading causes of opioid misuse, where approximately 6% of people continued opioid use after trauma or surgery. When people continue to use opioids beyond what a doctor prescribes, whether to minimize pain or induce euphoric feelings, it can mark the beginning stages of an opiate addiction, with a tolerance developing and eventually leading to dependence, when a person relies on the drug to prevent withdrawal symptoms.\\"Why opioid overdose deaths seem to happen in spurts\\", CNN, February 8, 2017 Writers have pointed to a widespread desire among the public to find a pill for any problem, even if a better solution might be a lifestyle change, such as exercise, improved diet, and stress reduction. Opioids are relatively inexpensive, and alternative interventions, such as physical therapy, may not be affordable. In the late 1990s, around 100 million people or a third of the U.S. population were estimated to be affected by chronic pain. This led to a push by drug companies and the federal government to expand the use of painkilling opioids.\\"America‚Äôs opioid epidemic is worsening\\", the Economist (U.K.) March 6, 2017, In addition to this, organizations like the Joint Commission began to push for more attentive physician response to patient pain, referring to pain as the fifth vital sign. This exacerbated the already increasing number of opioids being prescribed by doctors to patients. Between 1991 and 2011, painkiller prescriptions in the U.S. tripled from 76 million to 219 million per year, and as of 2016 more than 289 million prescriptions were written for opioid drugs per year. Mirroring the growth of opioid pain relievers prescribed is an increase in the admissions for substance abuse treatments and opioid-related deaths. This illustrates how legitimate clinical prescriptions of pain relievers are being diverted through an illegitimate market, leading to misuse, addiction, and death. With the increase in volume, the potency of opioids also increased. By 2002, one in six drug users were being prescribed drugs more powerful than morphine; by 2012, the ratio had doubled to one-in-three. The most commonly prescribed opioids have been oxycodone and hydrocodone. The epidemic has been described as a \\"uniquely American problem\\". The structure of the US healthcare system, in which people not qualifying for government programs are required to obtain private insurance, favors prescribing drugs over more expensive therapies. According to Professor Judith Feinberg, \\"Most insurance, especially for poor people, won't pay for anything but a pill.\\" Prescription rates for opioids in the US are 40 percent higher than the rate in other developed countries such as Germany or Canada. While the rates of opioid prescriptions increased between 2001 and 2010, the prescription of non-opioid pain relievers (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.) decreased from 38% to 29% of ambulatory visits in the same time period, and there has been no change in the amount of pain reported in the U.S.\\"The opioid epidemic could turn into a pandemic if we're not careful\\", Washington Post, February 9, 2017 This has led to differing medical opinions, with some noting that there is little evidence that opioids are effective for chronic pain not caused by cancer.\\"Opioid Prescriptions Fall After 2010 Peak, C.D.C. Report Finds\\", New York Times, July 6, 2017 === Women === The opioid epidemic affects women and men differently, For instance, women are more likely than men to develop a substance use disorder. Women are also more likely to suffer chronic pain than men are. There are also many more situations in which women are to receive pain medicine. In cases of domestic abuse and rape, women are prescribed pain medicine more than men. Along with that during pregnancy women may use prescription opioids to help with pregnancy pain, especially with post-pregnancy pain. Since women are more likely to be prescribed opioids, they are more likely to become addicted to these opioids which is what makes them a target to the opioid epidemic. The number of women that have died from opioid pain relievers has increased 5 times from what it was in 1999 in 2010. To help stop the spread of opioid abuse in women, it is advised that women are educated on the drugs that they are taking and the possible risk of addiction. Additionally, alternatives should always be used when possible in order to prevent addiction. === Adolescents === Teens are also another category of people that can become easily hooked on opioids. For teens the use of opioids usually does not start as a pain management drug, teens will engage in drugs as recreational drugs. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that for every opioid death of a teen there are 119 emergency visits and 22 treatment admissions related to opioid abuse. Easy accessibility to these opioids is another reason why these drugs are becoming popular. If family members are taking opioids for pain or have taken them in the past and did not dispose of them correctly, it can make it easy for adolescents to get their hands on them. Education on opioid use and opioid disorders is important to keep children away from these drugs. Not only are youth at heightened risk of developing opioid addictions, but treating opioid use disorder in this population is also more difficult than it is for older individuals. A systematic review of the epidemiologic literature has found that adolescents and young adults consistently have shorter retention times in medication treatments for opioid use disorder than do older adults. === Limited treatment === The continued prevalence of the opioid epidemic in the United States can be traced to many reasons. For one, there is a lack of appropriate treatments and treatment centers across the nation. Big cities like New York City are lacking in treatment services and health offices as well as small rural areas. Another reason that the opioid epidemic is hard to combat is that housing is limited to recovering addicts. Having limited housing makes it easy for recovering opioid users to return to old environments that promote drug abuse. Along with housing, jobs for recovering addicts can be difficult to find as well. Addicts with criminal records are not able to find jobs once they leave recovery. Having to combat job insecurity can lead to stress, which can push someone to relapse. The fact that ‚Äúwraparound services‚Äù, or programs that provide services for patients that have just come out of rehabilitation centers, are non-existent is also a reason why the opioid epidemic has gone on for so long. === Public policy response === The public reaction that has made the first step in ending the opioid epidemic was the lawsuit that the state of Oklahoma put up against Purdue Pharma. The state of Oklahoma argued that Purdue Pharma helped start the opioid epidemic because of assertive marketing and deceptive claims on the dangers of addiction. One of the marketing strategies was to redefine ‚Äúsubstance use disorder‚Äù as ‚Äúpseudo addiction\\". The Purdue Pharma agreed to settle and pay 270 million dollars to the state of Oklahoma that would go towards addiction research and treatment. The settlement could indicate a win for other states that have taken legal action against similar opioid manufacturers. Specifically, States like California are raising similar claims that Purdue Pharma market the drug Oxycontin as a safe and effective treatment, which led to the opioid crisis leaving thousands dead in California due to opioid overdoses. ==Canada== In 1993, an investigation by the chief coroner in British Columbia identified an ‚Äúinordinately high number‚Äù of drug- related deaths, of which there were 330. By 2017, there were 1,473 deaths in British Columbia and 3,996 deaths in Canada as a whole. Canada followed the United States as the second highest per capita user of prescription opioids in 2015. In Alberta, emergency department visits as a result of opiate overdose rose 1,000% in the previous five years. The Canadian Institute for Health Information found that while a third of overdoses were intentional overall, among those ages 15‚Äì24 nearly half were intentional. In 2017 there were 3,987 opioid-related deaths in Canada, 92% of these deaths being unintentional. The number of deaths involving fentanyl or fentanyl analogues increased by 17% compared to 2016. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan experienced a record month in opioid overdoses in May 2020 caused, authorities explained, by a combination of ever- amplifying toxic drugs and the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äôs quarantine keeping individuals from family and needed mental health services. In May 2020 Medavie Health Services provided over 250 ambulance services for overdoses, administering the opioid antagonist nasal spray Narcan (naloxone) in record numbers. What was a rare occurrence now happens in Saskatchewan‚Äôs largest city every other day. North America's first safe injection site, Insite, opened in the Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood of Vancouver in 2003. Safe injection sites are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities in which individuals are able to consume illicit recreational drugs, as part of a harm reduction approach towards drug problems which also includes information about drugs and basic health care, counseling, sterile injection equipment, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff, for instance in the event of an overdose. Health Canada has licensed 16 safe injection sites in the country. In Canada, about half of overdoses resulting in hospitalization were accidental, while a third were deliberate overdoses. OxyContin was removed from the Canadian drug formulary in 2012g and medical opioid prescription was reduced, but this led to an increase in the illicit supply of stronger and more dangerous opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil. In 2018 there were around 1 million users at risk from these toxic opioid products. In Vancouver Dr. Jane Buxton of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control joined the Take-home naloxone program in 2012 to provide at risk individuals medication that quickly reverses the effects of an overdose from opioids. ==Outside North America == Approximately 80 percent of the global pharmaceutical opioid supply is consumed in the United States.\\"Americans consume vast majority of the world's opioids\\", Dina Gusovsky, CNBC, April 27, 2016 It has also become a serious problem outside the U.S., mostly among young adults. The concern not only relates to the drugs themselves, but to the fact that in many countries doctors are less trained about drug addiction, both about its causes or treatment. According to an epidemiologist at Columbia University: \\"Once pharmaceuticals start targeting other countries and make people feel like opioids are safe, we might see a spike [in opioid abuse]. It worked here. Why wouldn't it work elsewhere?\\" Most deaths worldwide from opioids and prescription drugs are from sexually transmitted infections passed through shared needles. This has led to a global initiative of needle exchange programs programs and research into the varying needle types carrying STIs. In Europe, prescription opioids accounted for three-quarters of overdose deaths among those between ages 15 and 39. Some worry that the epidemic could become a worldwide pandemic if not curtailed. Prescription drug abuse among teenagers in Canada, Australia, and Europe were comparable to U.S. teenagers. In Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, and in parts of China, surveys found that one in ten students had used prescription painkillers for non-medical purposes. Similar high rates of non-medical use were found among the young throughout Europe, including Spain and the United Kingdom. While strong opiates are heavily regulated within the European Union, there is a \\"hidden addiction\\" with codeine. Codeine, though a mild painkiller, is converted into morphine in the liver. \\"It‚Äôs a hidden addiction,‚Äô said Dr Michael Bergin of Waterford Institute of Technology, Ireland. ‚ÄòCodeine abuse affects people with diverse profiles, from children to older people across all social classes.\\" === Myanmar === On 18 May 2020, Myanmar and the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) announced that, over the previous three months, police had confiscated illicit drugs with a street value estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars. Most was methamphetamine; they also seized 3,750 liters (990 gallons) of liquid methylfentanyl that can be used to manufacture a synthetic opioid. ===United Kingdom=== From January to August 2017, there were 60 fatal overdoses of fentanyl in the UK. Opioid prescribing in English general practice mirrors general geographical health inequalities. In July 2019 two Surrey GPs working for a Farnham-based online pharmacy were suspended by the General Medical Council for prescribing opioids online without appropriate safeguards. Scotland has a drug mortality rate of 175 per million population aged 15 to 64, by far the worst in Europe. Public Health England reported in September 2019 that half the patients using strong painkillers, antidepressants and sleeping tablets had been on them for more than a year, which was generally longer than was \\"clinically\\" appropriate and where the risks could outweigh the benefits. They found that problems in the UK were less than in most comparable countries, but there were 4,359 deaths related to drug poisoning, largely opioids, in England and Wales in 2018 the highest number recorded since 1993. Public Health England reported in September 2019 that 11.5 million adults in England had been prescribed benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, gabapentinoids, opioids or antidepressants in the year ending March 2018. Half of these had been prescribed for at least a year. About 540,000 had been prescribed opioids coninously for 3 years or more. Prescribing of opioids and Z-drugs had decreased, but antidepressants and gabapentinoids had increased, gabapentinoids by 19% between 2015 and 2018 to around 1.5 million. ==Accessibility of prescribed opioids== The worry surrounding the potential of a worldwide pandemic has affected opioid accessibility in countries around the world. Approximately 25.5 million people per year, including 2.5 million children, die without pain relief worldwide, with many of these cases occurring in low and middle-income countries. The current disparity in accessibility to pain relief in various countries is significant. The U.S. produces or imports 30 times as much pain relief medication as it needs while low-income countries such as Nigeria receive less than 0.2% of what they need, and 90% of all the morphine in the world is used by the world's richest 10%. America's opioid epidemic has resulted in an ‚Äúopiophobia‚Äù that is stirring conversations among some Western legislators and philanthropists about adopting a ‚Äúwar on drugs rhetoric‚Äù to oppose the idea of increasing opioid accessibility in other countries, in fear of starting similar opioid epidemics abroad. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a monitoring agency established by the U.N. to prevent addiction and ensure appropriate opioid availability for medical use, has written model laws limiting opioid accessibility that it encourages countries to enact. Many of these laws more significantly impact low-income countries; for instance, one model law ruled that only doctors could supply opioids, which limited opioid accessibility in poorer countries that had a scarce number of doctors. In 2018, deputy head of China's National Narcotics Commission Liu Yuejin criticized the U.S. market's role in driving opioid demand. In 2016, the medical news site STAT reported that while Mexican cartels are the main source of heroin smuggled into the U.S., Chinese suppliers provide both raw fentanyl and the machinery necessary for its production.\\"'Truly terrifying': Chinese suppliers flood US and Canada with deadly fentanyl\\", STAT, April 5, 2016, In British Columbia, police discovered a lab making 100,000 fentanyl pills each month, which they were shipping to Calgary, Alberta. 90 people in Calgary overdosed on the drug in 2015. In Southern California, a home-operated drug lab with six pill presses was uncovered by federal agents; each machine was capable of producing thousands of pills an hour. In 2018 a woman died in London after getting a prescription for tramadol from an online doctor based in Prague who had not considered her medical history. Regulators in the UK admitted that there was nothing they could do to stop this happening again. A reporter from The Times was able to buy opioids from five online pharmacies in September 2019 without any contact with their GP by filling in an online questionnaire and sending a photocopy of their passport. == Alternative for opioids == Alternative drug options for opioids include ibuprofen, Tylenol, Aspirin and steroid options, all of which can be prescribed to patients or provided to them over the counter. Along with drug alternatives, many other alternatives can provide relief through physical activities. Physical therapy, acupuncture, injections, nerve blocks, massages, and relaxation techniques are physical activities that have been found to help with chronic pain. New pain management drugs like Marijuana and Cannabinoids have also been found to help treat symptoms of pain. Many treatments like cancer treatments are using these drugs to help control pain. == Signs of addiction == People that are addicted to opioids can have many changes in behavior. Some of the common signs or symptoms of addiction include spending more time alone, losing interest in activities, quickly changing moods, sleeping at odd hours, getting in trouble with the law, and financial hardships. If you notice any of these behaviors in a peer or in oneself, a physician should be consulted with. == Treatment and prevention of addiction == Opioid use disorder can be treated in a number of different ways: Medication assisted treatment pathways offer Suboxone(Buprenorphine/naloxone) and Vivitrol (naltrexone). Cognitive behavioral therapies and counseling are proven effective, as well as digital care programs to increase abstinence rates. A number of methods for the prevention of opioid addiction have been used and suggested. One is the creation of anti-opioid advertisements. In the 1990s, such ads, depicting drug-seeking people purposefully slamming their arms into doors and crashing their cars, were unsuccessfully targeted at teens. Rosenberg, Tina. \\"Weaponizing Truth Against Opioids \\", New York Times, Jan. 28, 2020 Accessed June 20, 2020 These ads were unsuccessful because they emphasized the risk of danger, pain, and death caused by opioids. While this would make adults quit, teenagers need to see that executives just use them as interchangeable customers. The makers of these ads feel that since the internet allows teenagers to view gruesome things anyway, it is perfectly acceptable to subject them to images of self-mutilation in order to protect their lives. Lifflefield, Susan-Elizabeth. \\"Anti-Opioid Ads Aim to Prevent Addiction.\\", CBS June 5. Accessed June 20, 2020 It is felt that thirty seconds of gruesomeness is a small price to pay for sparing a lifetime (however short) of opioid abuse and its accompanying poverty and crime. Fortunately, these advertisements, which started in the 1980s, are continuing to play on television today, utilizing donated advertisement time. The goals of the most recent ads are to show teenagers that one can get addicted after only five days and that feeding this addiction can consume a person‚Äôs entire life.\\"White House Launches New Anti-Opioid Campaign Aimed at Youth\\" CBS News June 7.

There has been a debate between declinists, who believe America is in decline, and exceptionalists, who feel America stands for the ages to come. China's challenging the United States for global predominance constitutes the core issue in the debate over the American decline. According to American political activist Noam Chomsky, America's decline started shortly after the end of World War II, with the \\"loss of China\\" followed by the Indochina Wars. By 1970, the United State's share of world wealth had declined to about 25%, which was still large but sharply reduced. Chomsky dismisses the \\"remarkable rhetoric of the several years of triumphalism in the 1990s\\" as \\"mostly self-delusion\\". Chomsky argues that power will not shift to China and India, because these are poor countries with severe internal problems and there will be no competitor for global hegemonic power in the foreseeable future. Analysts suggest the decline either stems from, or has accelerated with, Trump's foreign policy and the \\"country‚Äôs ongoing withdrawal from the global arena.\\" ==Manifestations== U.S. hegemony has always been supported by three pillars: \\"economic strength, military might, and the soft power of cultural dominance.\\" ===Military=== Paul Kennedy posits that continued deficit spending, especially on military build-up, is the single most important reason for decline of any great power. The costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are now estimated to run as high as $4.4 trillion, which Kennedy deems a major victory for Osama bin Laden, whose announced goal was to bankrupt America by drawing it into a trap. By 2011 the U.S. military budget ‚Äî almost matching that of the rest of the world combined ‚Äî was higher in real terms than at any time since WWII. According to a 98-page report by National Defense Strategy Commission, \\"America's longstanding military advantages have diminished\\", and \\"The country's strategic margin for error has become distressingly small. Doubts about America's ability to deter and, if necessary, defeat opponents and honor its global commitments have proliferated.\\" The report cited \\"political dysfunction\\" and \\"budget caps\\" as factors restraining the government from keeping pace with threats in what the report described as \\"a crisis of national security.\\" The report wrote that, to neutralize American strength, China and Russia were trying to achieve \\"regional hegemony\\" and were developing \\"aggressive military buildups\\". In 2018, Air Force General Frank Gorenc said that the United States airpower advantage over Russia and China was shrinking. According to Forbes, the military's decline began when defense secretary Dick Cheney stopped a hundred major weapons programs 25 years ago when the Soviet Union collapsed. ===Culture and soft power=== American culture is in decline, according to Allan Bloom, E. D. Hirsch and Russel Jacoby. Samuel P. Huntington also believed that the American culture and politics had been in a constant decline since the late 1950s, coming in several distinct waves, namely in reaction to the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik; to the Vietnam War; to the oil shock of 1973; to Soviet aggression in the late 1970s; and to the general unease that accompanied the end of the Cold War. The rise of postmodernism since WWII has contributed to the decline of American culture, according to Goldfrab. Bloom observes that \\"instead of the pursuit of truth, there is an adolescent certainty that all is uncertain.\\" He criticizes his students for their relativism, narcissism and the decadence of love and friendship, pointing to such cultural icons as Mick Jagger, who portrays himself as a nihilistic rebel, both hetero and homosexual, embracing drugs and \\"the rock ideal of universal classless society founded on love.\\" Because youth bond with such decadent anti-heroes, they miss embracing the positive heroes of the past, never achieving a deep love for culture. William J. Bennett argues that America's cultural decline is signaling \\"a shift in the public‚Äôs attitudes and beliefs\\". The rate of maternal mortality has more than doubled in the U.S. since the late 1980s in stark contrast to other developed nations. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, published in 1993, statistically portraiting the moral, social and behavioral conditions of modern American society, often described as 'values', America's cultural condition was in decline with respect to the situations of 30 years ago, 1963. The index showed that there has been an increase in violent crime by more than 6 times, illegitimate births by more than 5 times, the divorce rate by 5 times, the percentage of children living in single-parent homes by four times, and the teenage suicide rate by three times during the 30-year period. By 2015, around half of American children were born to an unmarried mother. According to Kenneth Weisbrode, though statistics point to American decline (increased death rate, political paralysis, increased crime), \\"Americans have had a low culture for a very long time, and have long promoted it\\". He thinks that the obsession with decline is not something new, as something dating back to the Puritans. \\"Cultural decline, in other words, is as American as apple pie,\\" Weisbrode argues. Weisbrode likens pre-revolutionary France and present- day America for their vulgarity, which he argues is \\"an almost natural extension or outcome of all that is civilized: a glorification of ego.\\" ===World approval of American leadership=== This drop places the U.S. a notch below China's 31% and leaving Germany as the most popular power with an approval of 41%. ===Economy=== By 1970 U.S. share of world production had fallen from 40% to 25%, While economist Jeffrey Sachs observed the US share of world income was 24.6% in 1980 falling to 19.1% in 2011. The ratio of average CEO earnings to average workers‚Äô pay in the U.S. went from 24:1 in 1965 to 262:1 in 2005. A survey carried out by Pew Research Center shows that a majority of Americans predicted the U.S. economy to be weaker in 2050. Also, the survey says, a majority of the people thought the U.S. would be \\"a country with a burgeoning national debt, a wider gap between the rich and the poor and a workforce threatened by automation.\\" Some centrists believe that the American fiscal crisis stems from the rising expenditures on social programs or alternatively from the increases in military spending for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, both of which would lead to decline. However, Richard Lachmann argues that if none of military or overall spending are pressuring the U.S. economy, they would not contribute to U.S. decline. Lachmann describes the real problem as \\"the misallocation of government revenue and expenditure, resulting in resources being diverted from the tasks vital to maintain economic or geo-political dominance.\\" Kennedy argues that as military expenses grow, this reduces investments in economic growth, which eventually \\"leads to the downward spiral of slower growth, heavier taxes, deepening domestic splits over spending priorities, and weakening capacity to bear the burdens of defense.\\" ==Comparison with earlier states== Many of America's \\"leading\\" commentators, since more than half a century, have consistently described the U.S. as \\"a weak, bred out\\" basket case that will fall to stronger rivals as inevitably as Rome fell to the barbarians, or France to Henry V at Agincourt.\\" Michael Hudson points to debt forgiveness being necessary when individuals' debts to the state are too large. Rome put an end to this practice, whereas earlier empires (Assyrian) survived through periodic debt forgiveness, this practice ended with the Roman empire, resulting in impoverishment and dispossession of farmers, creating a growing lumpen proletariat. The same process contributed to the collapse of the British empire and continues today, with periodic financial crises (1930s, 2008) which are only relieved by government bailouts and/or war. Hudson adds that every time history repeats itself, the price goes up, i.e., the U.S. is being destroyed by bank debt with no forgiveness mechanism, making collapse inevitable. ===Ancient Rome=== Countries with United States military bases and facilities in 2016 Rome, Byzantium, the Tatar/Mongol Golden Horde, and the Ottoman Sublime Porte all provided two essential services‚Äîunhindered trade and security‚Äîin exchange for some amount of constant rapine and plunder and a few memorable incidents of genocide. The Tatar/Mongol Empire was by far the most streamlined: it simply demanded ‚Äúyarlyk‚Äù‚Äîtribute‚Äîand smashed anyone who attempted to rise above a level at which they were easy to smash. According to Dmitri Orlov, the American empire is \\"a bit more nuanced: it uses the US dollar as a weapon for periodically expropriating savings from around the world by exporting inflation while annihilating anyone who tries to wiggle out from under the US dollar system.\\" There were 38 large and medium-sized American facilities spread around the globe in 2005‚Äîmostly air and naval bases‚Äîapproximately the same number as Britain's 36 naval bases and army garrisons at its imperial zenith in 1898. The Roman Empire at its height in 117 AD required 37 major bases to police its realm from Britain to Egypt, from Hispania to Armenia. Yale historian Paul Kennedy compares the U.S. situation to Great Britain's prior to World War I. He comments that the map of U.S. bases is similar to Great Britain's before World War I. ===Britain=== Kennedy argues that ‚ÄúBritish financial strength was the single most decisive factor in its victories over France during the 18th century. This chapter ends on the Napoleonic Wars and the fusion of British financial strength with a newfound industrial strength.‚Äù As the U.S. dollar loses its role as world currency, it will not be able to continue to have trade deficits to finance its military expenditures. According to Richard Lachmann, the U.S. would last much longer if it, like Britain, could restrict particular families or elite control over offices and governmental powers. ===Soviet Union=== Dmitry Orlov argues that the US is now in a rapid decline, \\"retracing the trajectory of the Soviet Union in the early 1980s toward national bankruptcy and political dissolution\\". Orlov argues that U.S. is bedeviled by \\"runaway debt, a shrinking economy, and environmental catastrophes to rival Chernobyl\\". He believes that there are some parallels with the U.S.: outsized military spending, growing international debts and trade deficits, unwieldy governments, rigid ideology, ecological crisis, resource decline. ==Commentators== * American historian Morris Berman wrote a trilogy of books published between 2000 and 2011 about the decline of American civilization. * Igor Panarin, a KGB graduate, wrote The Crash of the Dollar and the Disintegration of the USA (2019). He predicted that America would crash and disintegrate into six parts as a result of economic collapse. * Russian Stanislav Belkovsky predicted that it might be America's turn to plunge into self-destructive violence and inevitable collapse. * American Chris Hedges, in his 2018 book America The Farewell Tour, predicts that \\"within a decade, two at most\\" America will cease to be the dominant super-power in the world. * In 2017, Evan Osnos of The New Yorker outlined a potential scenario for a violent revolution in the US and the consequences for the ‚Äúsuper-rich.‚Äù * In 2020, historian Harold James wrote an article titled \\"Late Soviet America\\" in Project Syndicate, in which he directly compared the present-day United States to the former Soviet Union. * Authors Gerald Celente, Stephen F.

It is the sixth game in the Mario & Sonic series, a crossover between Nintendo's Super Mario and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog franchises, and the first since the Rio 2016 Olympic Games edition. It was developed and published by Sega for the Nintendo Switch in November 2019 and for arcade cabinets in 2020. The game received mixed reviews, with praise for the minigames, humor, 2D style, gameplay and multiplayer but criticized the lack of content for single player and the online mode, while reception for the story mode have been mixed. ==Gameplay== Like previous Mario & Sonic titles, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is a sports game featuring a crossover cast of characters from Nintendo's Super Mario and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. The player, using one of the characters, competes in a multitude of events based on sports from the Olympic Games. The game features a variety of events; returning ones from previous Mario & Sonic titles include boxing, soccer, swimming, and gymnastics, while new ones include karate, skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing. The Nintendo Switch version supports a variety of controllers, including the Joy- Con motion controllers. The game also features single system split-screen multiplayer, LAN multiplayer, and online play. An additional 2D Mode is also included, based on the 1964 Summer Olympics, and featuring 8-bit and 16-bit styles for Mario and Sonic, respectively. These 2D Mode events have more limited controls and the option to enable a CRT overlay to further emulate the feel of games of that era. ==Development and release== In October 2016, Sega announced it had secured the licensing rights from the International Olympic Committee to publish video games based on the 2020 Summer Olympics, with plans for games to be released on various devices. Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 was announced alongside Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 - The Official Video Game on March 29, 2019, at the Sega Fes stage show in Japan. It was the first Mario & Sonic game since the Rio 2016 Olympic Games edition for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and was released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch in November 2019; a version for arcade cabinets will release sometime in 2020. A companion game for Android and iOS, Sonic at the Olympic Games - Tokyo 2020, was also released in 2020. The game was featured at E3 2019, and Gamescom 2019. Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 was the final game AlphaDream worked on before it filed for bankruptcy in 2019. Racjin, Yuke's, and Success Corp also worked on the game; Racjin helped develop previous Mario & Sonic games, while Yuke's helped Sega develop Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 - The Official Video Game. A tie-in free-to-start mobile phone game Sonic at the Olympic Games - Tokyo 2020 was released on May 7, 2020 on iOS and Android. Like its predecessor Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, it features similar gameplay to the main game, albeit lack of Mario characters and the 2D mode, additional events, and a new story. Despite the delay of the Tokyo Olympic Games from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the game will retain the \\"Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\\" name for branding purposes. ==Reception== Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 has received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" from critics according to the review aggregator Metacritic. The game has received praise for its mini games, which have been described as fun to play. The game has also received praise for the story mode for having its own mini- games, references to various Mario and Sonic games, respectively, humor, and Olympic history. Also, the game has received praise for the 2D events for adding value for fans of the retro Mario and Sonic style, as well as emulating the feel of sports games of that era, such as Track & Field. However, the game has also received criticism for its story mode having \\"tedious progression\\" and slow dialogue. The game has also received negative attention towards its lack of content for single players once they have finished the story mode. Reception to multiplayer was mixed. Local play received praise for making events more enjoyable and adding replay value, but was criticized for its limited options and \\"lack of formal structure\\". The online mode has been criticized due to lag, especially when playing with 8 players, although 2 to 4 players online has been reported to be smoother, with less lag. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 video games Category:2020 Summer Olympics Category:Arcade games Category:Crossover video games Category:Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Category:Mario sports games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Olympic video games Category:Sega video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in 2021 Category:Video games set in Asia Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Tokyo ","title":"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020"},{"id":"60367746","text":"Lena Saradnik (born January 23, 1947) is a former member of the Arizona House of Representatives.

The name Huangyao was first recorded in the Huangyou era (1049‚Äì1053) of Emperor Renzong when general Yang Wenguang passed through Zhaoping to pacify Guangxi, and the place was named after the two most common surnames of the locals living in the area ‚Äì Huang and Yao. The town first developed during the reign of Wanli Emperor (1572 ‚Äì 1620) of the Ming dynasty, and it prospered during the reign of Qianlong Emperor (1735 ‚Äì 1796) in the Qing dynasty. As a result, it has many buildings from the Qing and Ming eras, numbering at over 300. The town was part of a number of administrative divisions throughout its history; today Huangyao includes both an old town and a new district. Many of the buildings in the old town have stayed relatively unchanged in the modern era, and it began to develop as a tourist destination in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was listed as one the 50 most worthwhile places to visit in China in 2006. ==Description== View of Huangyao The karst peaks of Huangyao Huangyao is surrounded by karst peaks and traversed by streams.

She is best known for her multi-media sculptures and installations, which often incorporate a social component. Many of her works are made from crushed glass. She lives and works in New York, NY, and is an Assistant Professor of Art and Design at Purchase College, SUNY. Engaged in broad fields of practice from public art and traditional gallery work to activist based Community Theater, Owens tackles issues of hierarchical social conditions, environmental destruction, consumption and the points where these things intersect. Working sculpturally, performatively and socially, she uses material as meaning: what the sculpture is made of- is what the sculpture means- is what the sculpture does. Bottle shards, cardboard, coal, cut up humvees, and the dust of marble are all used to convey meaning, emotion, and action as they take on forms from porch to iceberg. Often with jobs beyond metaphor, the sculptures become stages, public seating, centers for protest and elevated vantage points. Owens has been included in exhibitions both in the US and internationally including The X Krasnoyarsk Biennial, RU; Franco Soffiantino Contemporary, IT; Austrian Cultural Forum, NY; The Frist Museum, TN; Socrates Sculpture Park, LIC; and the New Museum Window, NY among others. In February of 2020, her solo museum show, The Hypogean Tip opened at The Housatonic Museum of Art in Bridgeport CT. She has had reviews and inclusion in publications including The New York Times, The New Yorker, Art in America, Modern Painters, Flash Art and Triple Canopy Anthology and she has received grants from the Joan Mitchell, Pollack Krasner, and Harpo Foundations as well as a Cultural Humanitarian Grant from the US Consulate. Her work can be found in many collections in the US and abroad, among them; The Beth Rudin Dewoody Collection, The Pritzker Family, Sprint Collection and D. Mullin JR. Owens is Assistant Professor of Art & Design and Chair of the Sculpture Department at SUNY Purchase College. == Education == Rachel Owens received a BFA from the University of Kansas, Lawrence.

Hartzell studied to be an engineer at the University of Cincinnati, but quit his studies in 1917 to help his father in his lumber business.https://www.gradientlens.com/case- studies/hartzell-propeller/ ===Plane propellers=== An embargo enforced by the First World War made access to goods problematic, and the firm had to improvise. They changed production to rifle flasks, while also delivering lumber to companies that produced plane propellors. Orville Wright, who lived nearby, and knew of Hartzell's interest in planes and flying, suggested that the company started producing plane propellers themselves. Hartzell started doing this, and received an order from the US Navy for propellers for Liberty engines, the most common plane motor of the time. The war ended, and orders dried up. Hartzell began production of its first plane, the FC-1. The plywood plane participated in a race in 1923 which it won. An improved model, the FC-2, won a second race the following year. However, Hartzell found it problematic to compete against his own customers, and to combine production of propellors with aircraft. From the 1920s, the company again explored alternative ways of making money. He had heard that there was money in ceiling fans, and founded the Hartzell Propeller Fan Company. The company also made cabinets for radios and record players, and car wheels. At the same time, the company received orders from the Navy for propellors for the airships Macon and Shenandoah. With the Second World War came new opportunities and orders from the defence forces. Hartzell moved over from walnut propellors to metal for Curtiss-Wright and Hamilton Standard. After the war, he became the market leader in propellors with variable pitch made from aluminium, while also creating propellor blades from composite materials. In 1949 he patented the composite Hartzite. Thought to be lightweight and low cost, Harzell's propeller was the market leader in the 60s and 70s, with a market share of over 90% of two-engined small planes. Hartzell died in 1968. In 2015 he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. == References == ==External links== *Biography at nationalaviation.com Category:University of Cincinnati alumni Category:People from Darke County, Ohio Category:1896 births Category:1968 deaths Category:National Aviation Hall of Fame inductees Category:American aviation businesspeople Category:American company founders Category:Businesspeople from Ohio ","title":"Robert N.
