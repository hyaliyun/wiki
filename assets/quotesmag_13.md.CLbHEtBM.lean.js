The game of water golf observes similar rules and scoring to the game of golf. Players throw or use a club to launch a waterbag at a buoy or fixed floating marker. Depending on the waterway, there are a number of variations on the game. Water Golf is an all ages game played alone or in groups. It can include waterbag launching devices referred to as clubs. The game can start on land and progress to the water and back to land. All water-crafts can be used such as kayaks, rafts, and noodles. ==Rules and regulations== Players shoot at targets using a skipping waterbag that floats and can travel over 200 ft. Players can play on any watercraft observing similar rules and regulations as they would on a golf course. Players drive the skipping waterbag using a chosen launching device. The number of waterbags played, scoring, and general rules are determined by the group of players. Players keep track of their own waterbags. ===Standard play=== Standard play relates to the game most commonly associated to the game of golf. #Find a suitable location to tee off from and launch waterbag as far as you can toward the designated target. Allow all players to tee off. #Travel to your water bag and take your next shot. The player farthest from the target shoots first and the remaining players all take their shot in order of distance. #Players record number of shots required to hit target. Player with lowest score on hole leads the next tee. ===Water bocce ball=== An alternate game can be played when no established holes are present is water bocce ball. This variant of the game is played with two teams made up of either one, two, or four players each. The target is defined by the launch of a squibber, similar to the pallino ball in bocce ball. Both teams have four water bags per round. #One player launches the squibber to establish the target for the round. #The team that launched the squibber is allowed to shoot first, with the goal of getting as close to the squibber as possible. #Next, the other team is allowed to shoot with the same goal. #After each team has shot once, the team who does not have a bag closest to the squibber shoots. This continues until one team has used all their bags, at which point the other team uses their shots. #Scoring is based on how many bags one team has closer to the squibber than the closest ball of the other team (scores will be from 1-4 each round). #Games can go to any score desired but generally go to 7 to 13 points. ==Elements and equipment== Waterbag - Waterbags (also known as waterballs) are the primary object required for the sport and is comparable to the ball in golf. While any sort of ball capable of floating will work, balls specifically designed for the water are preferred. The primary products tailored to this game on the market are the WaterRipper(link) and Waboba Ball(link) although a tennis ball would work as well. ==References== Category:Forms of golf ","title":"Water Golf"},{"id":"35863190","text":"Bidesgan (, also Romanized as Bƒ´desgƒÅn, Bƒ´dsagƒÅn, and Bƒ´deskƒÅn; also known as Bidishk≈´n) is a village in Baghestan Rural District, in the Eslamiyeh District of Ferdows County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

It is debated how much performance is required to move classification from standard to high performance. Adding to confusion, the yardstick is constantly moving. Industry Practice Much as insurers objectively determine if an insured is youthful (ie. under 25), they also determine objectively which vehicles are considered high performance. For decades, it has been necessary to charge a higher premium for performance cars, especially with youthful drivers. Actuaries and underwriters stay current on new models coming out and note acceleration most often. It is most commonly used because handling and braking are subjective, and top speed is usually not exercised. The largest insurance companies flag a vehicle as high performance in line with the approximate guideline: max. 0-60 time in seconds = 4 + 16/( 2^rounddown(([modelyear] - 1906) / 30)). As such, a 1967 Camaro must accelerate faster than 8.0 seconds. A 1997 Camaro must accelerate faster than 6.0 seconds, otherwise it is rated as a standard performance vehicle. Any additional vehicle-specific surcharge would have to come from insurer experience (actual cost of replacement parts, repair labor, etc). While insurance companies quietly discern performance versus non-performance, they must disclose the surcharge and name the affected cars explicitly. This practice dates back to the mid-1960s The Department of Insurance mandates this disclosure. Note, sports car driving has been a popular past time in many countries. Agile vehicles with moderate power, (eg. early Mazda Miata, Triumph TR4) were considered sports cars. Contrary to owner expectations, they were never flagged as high performance cars. This can be verified in all major DOI filings. Further classification of performance cars is possible in the following categories: * Grand tourer ‚Äî a luxury performance car designed for high speed and long-distance driving * Hot hatch ‚Äî a high- performance version of mass-produced hatchback model * Muscle car ‚Äî a large American rear-wheel drive car with a V8 engine * Sports sedan ‚Äî a high- performance version of a sedan model * Supercar ‚Äî an expensive high-end sports car, with hypercars being the most expensive and fastest supercars.

It is believed to have killed some 3,500 people. ==Meteorological history== On 25 July Admiral Graves sailed a fleet from Bluefields, Jamaica, escorted by a naval force consisting of his flagship, the 74-gun , and the 74-gun ships and , with the 36-gun frigate . Graves was escorting a number of French ships captured by the British during operations off North and Central America. These were the 110-gun Ville de Paris, the 74-gun ships Glorieux and Hector and the 64-gun Ardent, all captured at the Battle of the Saintes by Sir George Brydges Rodney's fleet, and the 74-gun Caton, captured at the Battle of the Mona Passage by Sir Samuel Hood. Also with the fleet were a number of British merchant ships. Graves also had under his command the captured former-French 74-gun Jason, but she did not leave with the rest of the fleet, having stayed at Jamaica to complete her watering. In the night of 5 September, Hector met the French frigates Aigle and Gloire; in the ensuing Action of 5 September 1782, Hector sustained severe damage, but was saved from capture by the rest of the convoy. ==Impact== On 17 September 1782, the fleet under Admiral Graves was caught in a violent storm off the banks of Newfoundland. Ardent and Caton were forced to leave the fleet and make for a safe anchorage, Ardent returning to Jamaica and Caton making for Halifax in company with Pallas. Of the rest of the warships, only Canada and Jason survived to reach England. The French prizes Ville de Paris, Glorieux and Hector foundered, as did HMS Centaur. had to be abandoned, and was burnt. A number of the merchant fleet, including Dutton, British Queen, Withywood, Rodney, Ann, Minerva and Mentor also foundered.

A custom pyramid- shaped screening pavilion was constructed for the film's debut, designed by conceptual firms DONDA, OMA and 2x4. The theater featured seven screens - three in the front, one on the floor, one on the ceiling and one on both the right and left side of the space. Cruel Summer was shot using a specialized camera rig, which allowed the directors to capture multiple angles simultaneously. This style of filming and screening a movie has since become known as the \\"Seven Screen Experience\\". The film is inspired by the album of the same name by West's record label GOOD Music. It has been described as a \\"fusion of short film and art\\", with the LA Times raving Cruel Summer has a \\"thumping surround-sound quality that makes a 3-D Michael Bay effort feel like an iPad short.\\" == Synopsis == Rafi (Scott Mescudi), a high-end car thief, falls in love with a blind Arabian princess whose father (Ali Suliman) will only allow them to wed if he can pass a series of three challenges. Loosely based on old Arabian folk tales, the story culminates in a final challenge where Rafi must cure the Princess of her blindness in order to gain her companionship. == Background == Emissaries of West's team, Executive Producer Alex Rosenberg and writer Elon Rutberg, traveled to Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, Qatar in January 2012 to commence initial pre-production. They met with heads of state and prominent government officials, royalty, and private executives in each location to secure funding and shooting permits. It later emerged that Cruel Summer would be exclusively shot in Doha, the capital city of Qatar. The project was produced in association with the Doha Film Institute, a cultural and film financing organization chaired by Her Excellency Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, a member of Qatar's royal family and sister of the ruling Emir, His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Sarah A., a first time Qatari actress played the female lead in Cruel Summer. Never before has a Qatari woman starred in a movie in the country's history. Production of the film took place in mid-April, just one month before the movie's premiere during Cannes Film Festival. Post-production and editing subsequently occurred in New York City. West described the seven-screen project as an attempt to \\"change entertainment experiences. Like if McQueen or Tarsem was to meet the entertainment value of Cirque du Soleil or Walt Disney.\\" ==Reviews== Cruel Summer received positive reviews. The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"groundbreaking\\" and exclaimed \\"It turns out Kanye West didn‚Äôt just want to make a short film -- he wants to completely change the way movies are watched.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote the film has \\"new music from West and a thumping surround-sound quality that makes a 3-D Michael Bay effort feel like an iPad short. \\"Cruel Summer\\" was shot with multiple cameras, with each screen offering a different perspective on the action.\\" Rolling Stone commented the piece has \\"plenty of striking imagery\\" and praised West's \\"great visual sense\\". == References  External links == * Category:2012 films Category:2012 short films Category:American films Category:American short films Category:2010s hip hop films Category:Films directed by Kanye West Category:English-language films Category:American musical drama films Category:Films shot in Qatar Category:2010s musical films Category:Multi- screen film ","title":"Cruel Summer (film)"},{"id":"35863360","text":"Afqu (, also Romanized as Afq≈´ and Afq≈´y; also known as AfkƒÅn, AughƒÅn, and OwghƒÅn) is a village in Borun Rural District, in the Eslamiyeh District of Ferdows County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Jenkins (previously called Miller-Jenkins v. Miller-Jenkins), 912 A.2d 951 (2006), 637 S.E.2d 330 (2006), 661 S.E.2d 822 (2008), 78 S.E.2d 268 (2009) 12 A.3d 768 (2010), 131 S.Ct. 568 (2010) is a series of related cases in the Virginia Supreme Court and the Vermont Supreme Court pertaining to child custody of Isabella Miller-Jenkins between former lesbian couple Lisa Miller and Janet Jenkins after they dissolved their civil union in Vermont. The protracted custody battle resulted in substantial media attention and an international parental kidnapping investigation after Miller failed to comply with court-ordered visitation for Jenkins. ==Background== In 2000, two women, Janet Jenkins and Lisa Miller of Rutland, Vermont, entered into a civil union in Vermont following the passage of civil union legislation earlier that year. Each changed her surname to Miller-Jenkins. In 2002, Lisa gave birth to a child conceived through artificial insemination, whom the couple named Isabella Miller-Jenkins. The couple separated in 2003, due to Miller accusing Jenkins of exposing Isabella to sexually explicit material, and possible sexual abuse. This triggered a protracted legal battle over the custody of Isabella. ==Vermont case== In the civil union dissolution proceedings, primary custody of Isabella was granted to Miller as Miller was her biological mother, while Jenkins was granted visitation rights. Miller subsequently moved to Virginia, which does not recognize civil unions, and denied attempts by Jenkins to visit Isabella. Miller further stated that she had become a Christian and was no longer a lesbian. ==Virginia case== In July 2004, Miller requested and received a court order in Virginia court declaring her Isabella's sole legal parent. Jenkins appealed in November, arguing on the basis of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act that the Virginia courts were obligated to comply with the rulings in Vermont family court. The Supreme Court of Virginia agreed and in November 2006 ordered that Jenkins be provided with visitation rights. For the next three years, Miller consistently failed to comply with visitation orders and in November 2009, Vermont ordered that sole custody of Isabella be given to Jenkins, with transportation occurring on January 1, 2010. Neither Miller nor Isabella appeared at the court-ordered time. ==Federal case== In 2010, Miller petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court. The Court declined to hear the case on November 8. ==Parental kidnapping investigation== In April 2011, the FBI arrested Timothy Miller, a Mennonite pastor of no relation to Lisa, and charged him with assisting with the international kidnapping of Isabella. The FBI alleged that Timothy had left a digital trail of himself and other Mennonite missionaries discussing Lisa's situation and her desire to flee the United States and that his mother-in-law's credit card was used to purchase tickets for Lisa and Isabella to fly to El Salvador and thereafter to Nicaragua, where Timothy and his wife had served as missionaries previously. Timothy pleaded not guilty to the charges and requested that the charges be moved from the district court for Vermont to the district court for Western Virginia on the basis that this is where the alleged crime would have been committed. He also requested that his statements to investigators be excluded from the evidence as he was not read his Miranda rights. In October of the same year, the FBI dropped its charges against Timothy as he began cooperating with the investigation. In December, Kenneth Miller (no relation to Lisa nor Timothy) was arrested and charged with aiding the kidnapping based on evidence obtained from Timothy.

The game takes place on a tropical island and puts players in the role of a resort owner who must build a profitable venue for visitors by constructing a variety of buildings and decorations, as well as roads to connect amenities to each other. The game was the highest-grossing on Google Play for more than 26 weeks. ==Gameplay== Paradise Island is a city- building game in which players try to earn as much in-game money as possible by building the most appropriate structures in the best locations, and eventually spending their savings to unlock additional parcels of land to develop. The game has three different classes of buildings to construct (residential, entertainment, and resource-producing), and three different classes of decorations to construct (plants, attractions, and holiday-themed ornaments). Over the course of the game, players will gain experience levels that unlock higher-level buildings and decorations. ==Reception== Paradise Island has been fairly well received by critics, receiving a score of 4 stars out of 5 from Android Games Review writer \\"Wild Willy,\\" who described it as \\"a fun game where you can nurture your own romantic island and it‚Äôs an excellent way of killing time every day.\\" GameZebo reviewer Talor Berthelson gave the game 2.5 stars out of 5, speaking highly of the game's music and item variety, but calling its progression system slow and challenging. ==References== Category:2010 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:City-building games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Video games developed in Russia ","title":"Paradise Island (video game)"},{"id":"35863417","text":"Yakso Falls is a waterfall on Little River, in the Cascade Range east of Roseburg in the U.S. state of Oregon.

It is located in the buildings of the former College of St. Barbara, and has been registered as a historical monument from 9 December 1999. The BIU St. Barbara is led by Fran√ßois Michaud, chief curator of the library. ==History== The old refectory is decorated with mosaics by Giandomenico Facchina. Periodical room The College of St. Barbara was founded in 1460 by Geoffrey Lenormant. Directed by Ernest Lheureux, a pupil of Theodore Labrouste, construction of the Charti√®re and Valette buildings was undertaken between 1881 and 1884. Dating from 1936, the construction of the √âcosse (Scotland) wing by Daniel Lionel and Raoul Brandon was completed in 1939. The transformation of Santa Barbara library is part of the U3M (Universities for the Third Millennium) plan, a program for development of higher education and research in the Ile-de-France. Formally established by Decree No. 2004-1121 of 14 October 2004, the inter-university library of St. Barbara is administratively attached to the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle, and a preparatory team worked 60 rue de Wattignies (Paris 12) between 2001 and 2008. In February 2008, the team settled permanently in the premises of the College Sainte-Barbe located at 4 rue Valette (Paris 5), renovated by the architect Antoine Stinco. Open to the public since 9 March 2009, it shares a portion of its premises with the library of the Sorbonne from May 2010 during its renovation. ==Purpose== Metallic architecture of the old drawing room Primarily aimed at undergraduates, the library complements other university libraries in the Latin Quarter. Situated in the immediate vicinity of the Sainte-Genevi√®ve and Cujas libraries, Sainte-Barbe offers everyone open access to collections on law, economics, social sciences, languages, literature and arts. Its collections, strongly oriented to help students succeed in the beginning of the course, are complementary to those of its illustrious neighbors. ==Operation== Bas-relief of Charles Gauthier in the drawing room Open from 10am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday, the library serves undergraduates and students of Masters courses at public universities in Paris and the Ile de France, with a potential readership of 100,000 students.

It was the western European centre for production of the Ford Transit van. The last vehicle was produced on 26 July 2013, ending Ford's vehicle assembly operations in the UK. ==History== The plant, on a site near Southampton Airport, was built as a shadow factory to assemble aircraft components for engineering firm Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft, and was opened by the Mayor of Southampton on 2 February 1939. At the outbreak of World War II, the factory and its supply chain were switched to produce parts for the Supermarine Spitfire. Recognised as an important part of the British war effort, it was bombed on a number of occasions by the German Luftwaffe, the first in September 1940. In the later years of the war, the site was used to assemble the Spitfire. After Cunliffe-Owen was placed in receivership in 1947, the factory was bought in 1949 by Briggs Motor Bodies, who supplied Ford of Britain with bodies for their vehicles. In 1953 Ford acquired Briggs, and hence gained control of the Southampton plant. The factory now specialised in building truck bodies, which were attached to the chassis that had been produced at Slough. From 1965, Ford had started to produce the Ford Transit in Great Britain, with bodies sent by road from Swaythling to be mated with chassis at the Langley, Berkshire factory, near Slough. In 1972, Ford of Britain invested ¬£5M in the Southampton plant, enabling it to make the complete Transit van. The first Transit rolled off the production line in the same year, and was given to the mayor to be used as a gift for a local charity. From this time until the mid-1980s was the height of production, with the factory employing 4,500 workers. In 1983, with construction of the M27 motorway starting, the site was permanently cut off from Southampton Airport. This made a compact site even more so, with the motorway to the north; a railway to the west; a graveyard to the east; and pinned in by the airport. This led to unusual layouts for parts of the factory, with the paint shop arranged on the vertical axis over six stories, as opposed to the traditional horizontal layout. In 2002, Ford stopped producing passenger cars in the UK, leaving the Southampton-made Transit as their only British-made vehicle. In 2009, with the new Ford Otosan plant in Kocaeli Province, Turkey in full production, Ford halved production at Southampton and reduced the workforce to just over 500. The six-millionth Ford Transit was built in 2009. Engines were sourced from either the Dagenham or Bridgend plants. This allowed the factory to produce up to 75,000 vehicles annually, of which 50% were exported. ==Closure== In September 2011, Ford of Europe confirmed that Southampton would continue to make the short and medium wheelbase, and Tourneo minibus versions, of the Transit for two more years. Production of these was then to be consolidated to Turkey with the new model in 2014, while Southampton was to continue as the European centre for the chassis-cab variant of the new Transit, with production ramped up to 35,000 units a year. On 26 October 2012, Ford announced that, as part of a larger cutback of their European production capacity, the Southampton factory would close altogether in July 2013, with production for Europe of all the new Transit models shifted to Turkey. The Dagenham Stamping Plant was also to be shut down; this plant had provided most of the sheet metal panels for the Southampton Assembly Plant. The last Transit went into production on 15 July 2013 and was completed on 26 July. Workers who had not accepted either redundancy or early retirement were redeployed to: *A new ¬£12 million distribution centre at Southampton Docks *A new vehicle refurbishment plant at the existing site, employing 134 staff *Ford's other UK factories manufacturing engines, at Bridgend (petrol) or Dagenham (diesel). Demolition of the Southampton plant began in 2015 and by September 2017, the factories on the site had been completely demolished. ==References== Southampton Category:Former motor vehicle assembly plants Category:British shadow factories Category:Buildings and structures in Southampton Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in the United Kingdom Category:Manufacturing plants in England ","title":"Ford Southampton plant"},{"id":"35863487","text":"Lajenu (, also Romanized as Lajen≈´) is a village in Borun Rural District, in the Eslamiyeh District of Ferdows County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The smaller, older of the two versions of this painting formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting. The larger version has been in the collection of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh since 1980. ==Background== The source for In the Car was Girls' Romances number 78 (September 1961). The painting is based on a panel illustrated by Tony AbruzzoBarsalou, David. \\"In the Car,\\" Deconstructing Roy Lichtenstein (2000).

(the romance comic imprint of DC Comics).\\"DC : Signal Publishing Company (Indicia / Colophon Publisher),\\" Grand Comics Database. Retrieved Sept. 14, 2020: \\"Used for DC's romance comics.\\" The painting was part of Lichtenstein's second solo exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery from September 28 to October 24, 1963 that included Drowning Girl, Torpedo...Los!, Baseball Manager, Conversation, and Whaam! Marketing materials for the show included the lithograph artwork, Crak! The smaller version, which was the original version, from the estate of Roy Lichtenstein and consigned by his son Mitchell Lichtenstein, was sold in 2005. On November 8, 2005, it surpassed the previous Lichtenstein work record auction price of $7.1 million set when Happy Tears sold three years earlier (November 13, 2002). In the Car sold for $16.2 million at Christie's auction house in New York City. In November 2010, this figure was surpassed when Ohhh...Alright... was sold for a record US $42.6 million (¬£26.7 million), also at Christie's in New York. The hammer price was $38 million. ==Details== After 1972, Lichtenstein's comics-based women \\"look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup.\\" This particular example is one of several that is cropped so closely that the hair flows beyond the edges of the canvas. As with most of his early romance comics, this consisted of \\"a boy and a girl\\" subject. It is described as a tense, melodramatic graphic single-frame depiction of a romantic dialogue between a man and woman. Lichtenstein used horizontal parallel lines to convey the sense of motion. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that this was one of the \\"broad and powerful paintings\\" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein produced several \\"fantasy drama\\" paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing the women to be miserable, such as Drowning Girl, Hopeless and In the Car. These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent \\"girls next door\\" in a variety of tenuous emotional states. \\"In the Car evokes a mood of resignation, with silence apparently prevailing as the woman stares stonily out the window.\\" The painting gives off a feeling of chilly emotions between the man and the woman in the car. ==See also== * 1963 in art ==NotesReferences== *. *. *. ==External links== *Lichtenstein Foundation website *http://www.christies.com/presscenter/pdf/11092005/11092005c.pdf Christies auction results] *Christies video presentation *National Galleries Scotland website Category:1963 paintings Category:Paintings by Roy Lichtenstein ","title":"In the Car"},{"id":"35863505","text":"Patak-e Pain (, also Romanized as Pata·∏µ-e PƒÅ‚Äôƒ´n) is a village in Borun Rural District, in the Eslamiyeh District of Ferdows County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

First launched in 1988, each year it shows documentary features, shorts and narratives, and women filmmakers from around the world attend and participate in after-film question-and-answer (Q&As;) and forums. ==Overview== The RMWFF is a three-day film festival held annually in November. In the week leading up to the festival, a \\"Festival in the Community\\" program offers free film screenings, and a youth outreach program is offered for at-risk youths. The RMWFF also produces an event every April highlighting award-winning short films. In June, the RMWFF hosts a weekend workshop for filmmakers who have previously attended the festival. The organization also maintains the Madelyn Osur Film Library, a collection of over 200 films from past festivals. ==History== The Rocky Mountain Women's Film Festival was created by Jere E. Martin and Donna Guthrie in 1987 in an effort to expose Colorado Springs to films by women or about women. According to Martin, \\"We wanted to tap into a strong community of progressive people in Colorado Springs who valued rich and diverse information, who supported the arts and respected and affirmed life in all its different iterations. Our intention was to expand people's consciousness - including our own - and continue to grow wiser about all the important issues facing us in this world of special interests and the deft marketing viewpoints of consumerism.\\" ==Demographics== Demographics vary widely among the programs. The main festival serves a largely female audience, 90% white, 50% have graduate degrees, and 32% have household incomes over $100,000. The Festival in the Community screenings generally reflect a more diverse audience, consistent with the location of the screening (University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) sees mostly a college-age audience while the screening at the Pikes Peak Public library attracts more retirees). The Youth Outreach Program reaches an entirely different demographic: many more males than females, with ages ranging from 12 to 18. ==Youth Outreach Program== The Youth Outreach program targets a broad segment of the community that may not be able to see the festival itself. This part of the festival is directed at youth, ages 12‚Äì18, who live in many different areas around Colorado Springs. The participants in this program are exposed to a variety of films and filmmakers, in order to expose youth to the world around them and the art of film making. == See also == * List of women's film festivals ==References *Rocky Mountain Women's Film Festival Category:Women's film festivals Category:Film festivals in Colorado Category:Culture of Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:1988 establishments in Colorado Category:Women in Colorado ","title":"Rocky Mountain Women's Film Festival"},{"id":"35863614","text":"God for Sale: Daivam Vilppanakku is a 2013 Malayalam satirical drama film written and directed by Babu Janardhanan and starring Kunchacko Boban in the lead role with Jyothi Krishna, Suraj Venjaramoodu, Anumol, Tini Tom and Thilakan plays other pivotal roles.

The film opens with the arrest of Poornananda Swami (Kunchacko Boban) who is alleged of child sacrifice. His story is unveiled through versions put forth by the accused and his brother Baskaran (Suraj Venjaramoodu). The plot of the movie shifts to the seventies. Attingal village is home to Kamalasanan Pillai (Suraj Venjaramoodu), a tailor. One fine morning, after a Kadhaprasangam performance, Pillai was found dead under suspicious circumstances. From there, the plot shifts to a more contemporary period. Prasannan (Kunchakko Boban), son of Kamalasanan Pillai, is now a hardworking daily wages labourer, who has a lady love (Jyothi Krishna). Again, the backdrop changes, and the protagonist is seen as a brilliant law student in a famous college. Prasannan confronts some bitter truths in his early life that alters his personality. When he joins the college, he is attracted to Leftist thinking. Later he falls in love with a rich woman, and eventually turns into an affluent person, and an emotional downfall turns him into an alcoholic.

Broadwater, known as Chris Broadwater (born March 22, 1972), is an attorney in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who was a Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 86, which encompasses within Tangipahoa Parish the communities of Independence, Tickfaw, Natalbany, and northwestern Hammond, Broadwater's own city of residence. Broadwater first won office in 2011 and abruptly resigned in December 2017. ==Background== A native of Saint Francisville in West Feliciana Parish, Broadwater is a 1995 graduate of Southern Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville. In 1998, he graduated in 1998 from the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. In 2002, he received his Juris Doctor from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. Broadwater and his wife, the former Hilaria Nelson, originally from Franklinton in Washington Parish have three daughters ‚Äî Emma Grace, Rose Kathron, and Maggie Frances. The Broadwaters are members of First Presbyterian Church of Hammond. ==Career== Broadwater listed the key campaign issues in 2011 as economic development and education. He claimed that his private sector experience and his work as the former director of the office of workers compensation would give him an early advantage as a legislator. Broadwater promised to pursue a balanced state budget. As the former head of a state agency, he developed and managed a $62 million departmental budget during the first term of Governor Bobby Jindal. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors member David Ramsey at a reception for legislators hosted by the Hammond Chamber of Commerce in Southeastern Louisiana University's War Memorial Student Union. Broadwater won the seat vacated by the term-limited Speaker Jim Tucker in a low-turnout general election held on November 19, 2011. Tucker himself ran unsuccessfully for Louisiana Secretary of State but lost to incumbent Tom Schedler. District 86 had been relocated after the 2010 United States Census. The \\"District 86\\" represented by Tucker was south of Lake Pontchartrain, but Broadwater's constituency was entirely north of the Lake. (The area south of the Lake had lost population because of Hurricane Katrina.) At the end of the special legislative session in June 2017, Broadwater secured House support without a single dissenting vote on the resolution introduced by state Senator Rick Ward, III, of Port Allen in West Baton Rouge Parish, which implores lawmakers to act in a more civil fashion toward one another, not to let partisanship and political views sour personal relations with colleagues. \\"There are always a lot of heated discussions, but it seems to me like we're moving away from philosophical disagreements on issues and getting personal,\\" Ward said. Republican U.S. Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana's 4th congressional district, who is a former member of the state House of Representatives, expressed a similar view in a document which he wrote as a congressional freshman. Statewide radio talk show host Moon Griffon has been sharply critical of what he claims is Broadwater's largely Democratic political philosophy, having called Broadwater a \\"fiscal fool.\\" Though the lawmaker is a registered Republican, he has been conciliatory to policies advanced by Governor John Bel Edwards.The Moon Griffon Show, June 20, 2017. Broadwater has previous experience with the Louisiana Workforce Commission. In March 2018, he was named vice president of workforce policy for the Louisiana Community and Technical College System. ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:American Presbyterians Category:Louisiana College alumni Category:Louisiana lawyers Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Louisiana State University Law Center alumni Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary alumni Category:Politicians from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:People from Hammond, Louisiana Category:People from Washington Parish, Louisiana Category:People from St. Francisville, Louisiana Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Chris Broadwater"},{"id":"35863923","text":"According to the political theorist Alan Johnson, there has been a revival of serious interest in communism in the 21st century led by Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and Alain Badiou. Other leading theorists are Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Gianni Vattimo, Alessandro Russo, Jodi Dean and Judith Balso as well as Alberto Toscano (translator of Alain Badiou), Terry Eagleton, Eduard Limonov, Bruno Bosteels and Peter Hallward. In 2009, many of these advocates contributed to the three-day conference, \\"The Idea of Communism\\", in London that drew a substantial paying audience. Theoretical publications, some published by Verso Books, include The Idea of Communism, edited by Costas Douzinas and ≈Ωi≈æek; Badiou's The Communist Hypothesis; and Bosteels's The Actuality of Communism. The defining common ground is the contention that \\"the crises of contemporary liberal capitalist societies‚Äîecological degradation, financial turmoil, the loss of trust in the political class, exploding inequality‚Äîare systemic; interlinked, not amenable to legislative reform, and requiring 'revolutionary' solutions\\".. In the introduction to The Idea of Communism (2009), ≈Ωi≈æek and Douzinas also identified four common premises among the thinkers in attendance: # The idea of communism confronts depoliticization through a return to voluntarism. # Communism as a radical philosophical idea. It must be thought of as taking distance from economism and statism as well as learning from the experiences of the 21st century. # Communism combats neoliberalism by returning to the idea of the \\"common\\". # Communism as freedom and equality.

He also served as an assistant coach at Merrimack College. After being drafted for the Vietnam War Irving served in the Mekong Delta prior to being assigned to the United States National Team for the 1972 Winter Olympics. He helped the US win an Olympic silver medal. == Playing career  Amateur === Irving learned to play hockey on local ponds in Beverly, Massachusetts. He did not play indoor hockey until he was 10 years old. Irving played high school hockey for Beverly High School. Immediately after high school he played in Quebec where he played for a farm team of the Montreal Junior Canadiens. He returned to Massachusetts as a 19-year-old and joined the New England Amateur League. While there he played with Jimmy Logue who was a member of the United States Olympic team in 1964 and 1968. Irving was named to an all-star team that played in an international tournament in Lake Placid, New York. Logue was impressed by Irving's performance at the tournament. Logue told Irving if he was ever interested in playing international hockey to let him know. === Vietnam === After the end of the season Irving was drafted in to the Armed Forces for the Vietnam War. Irving reported to Fort Dix in New Jersey for recruit training as part of the United States Army. He finished basic training and received orders for advanced infantry training remaining at Fort Dix. While Irving was training preparations for the 1971 US National team were taking place. Logue wanted Irving to attend the try-outs for the team and upon learning Irving was in military training Logue contacted his former Olympic coach Murray Williamson, and who was helping with the 1971 team, in an attempt to get Irving released. The US Army took pride in having their soldiers representing their country and would release players to for training and games. As long as they were with the National team players would not have to report back to their original assignment as they were assigned temporary duty to the team. The duo managed to get Irving a 48-hour pass to attend the try-outs. He completed his training and was assigned to Vietnam. Irving was given a 30-day leave before being shipped out. During his leave Irving worked out for four hours a day and called Logue daily to find out if there was news on if he had made the team. He was told that he was a possible candidate for the Olympic team. When he returned to Fort Dix Irving had not heard if he had made the team. Prior to being deployed Irving asked his captain if he could check if he would be released to join the US national team. While they checked on his status with the team Irving was sequestered to a holding barracks. After four days he was informed that there was no guarantee he would make the team and only a guarantee would allow him to be released to play for the National Team. Upon arriving in Vietnam Irving was station in a small town 100 miles from Saigon in the Mekong Delta. He was offered his choice of jobs, either a radio operator or mail clerk. Fearing being a radio operator would put him in greater danger Irving chose to be the mail clerk. Despite being in Vietnam Irving still hoped to make the Olympic team and had his father send him hockey pucks and sticks. Irving shot pucks against bunkers and sandbags and in a fox hole. After serving for nine months the end of his tour of duty approached. He was offered a chance to re-up for another six months. By doing so he would be moved closer to base and away from the heavier fighting he had already experienced. Following his acceptance of the six-month extension Irving continued to stay in shape by playing tennis matches against doctors and military officers on base. In September 1971 Irving was assigned temporary duty to report to Minneapolis, Minnesota to participate in the National team try-outs for the 1972 Olympic team. === United States Olympic Team === Irving was able to return to the United States 10 days prior to the try-outs and skated in the New England Amateur League. Irving survived the first rounds of cut in the try-out and joined the team for exhibition play. Irving struggled in the early exhibition games and was being pushed around by bigger players. Because he was assigned to the Olympic team if he were cut he would have to return to Vietnam. Following a game Logue asked Williamson, now the head coach of the Olympic team, about Irving's chances of making the team. Williamson told him Irving was struggling and was not sure if he would make the team, to which Logue replied \\"what are you going to do-send the kid back to Vietnam? How are you going to feel about that?\\" Williamson decided to keep Irving around as long as he could. Two weeks before the Olympics began the US team lost a game to the Soviet Union 11‚Äì4. Irving scored two goals in the game against Vladislav Tretiak, who was considered one of the best goaltenders in the world at the time. After the game Williamson informed Irving that he had made the team. He finished his military service as a member of the Olympic team. In his first Olympic game Irving scored an insurance goal in the final minutes of Team USA's 5‚Äì3 win over Switzerland. The win put the Americans into the round robin medal round. In the medal round the US lost their first game against Sweden. They rebounded to upset Czechoslovakia, before losing the Soviet Union. The Americans won their fourth game or the round robin defeating Finland 4‚Äì1. The win put the United States in a position to win a medal. In the American's final game of the Olympics Irving recorded a goal and an assist in a 6‚Äì1 win over Poland. Even with the win the team's medal status had not been determined. Depending on the outcome of two other games the US could finish between second to out of the medals. In the first game Finland upset Sweden assuring the Americans of a medal. In the Gold medal game The USSR defeated Czechoslovakia. The loss by the Czechs gave the American's the silver medal. === Professional === After returning to the States Irving joined the Jacksonville Barons of the American Hockey League. He played only four games with the Barons before joining the Saginaw Gears of the International Hockey League. He played parts of seven season with Saginaw recording 169 goals and 378 points in 456 regular season games. He added another 32 goals and 64 point in 72 playoff games. He finished the 1979‚Äì80 season with the Grand Rapids Owls, before joining the Milwaukee Admirals to start the 1980‚Äì81 season. Irving finished the final three years of his career with the Muskegon Mohawks. He recorded 33 goals and 76 points in 146 games following his time with the Gears. After he retired from professional ice hockey Irving served as an assistant coach at Merrimack College. == Career statistics == { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" ID=\\"Table3\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:75%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

A Republican, he has served since 2012 as member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 62, which encompasses most of East and West Feliciana parishes and the northwest corner of East Baton Rouge Parish, including the city of Zachary. He will vacate his House seat when he takes over as parish president. ==Background== A graduate of Jackson High School in Jackson, Louisiana, Havard attended ITI Technical College and Louisiana State University, both in Baton Rouge, to study industrial instrumentation and design. Prior to his election, he had worked for eighteen years as a manager of engineering sales and a business development executive in the petrochemical, oil, and natural gas industries. Havard vowed in his campaign announcement to work to \\"create new jobs ... streamline government and rescind current regulation that create barriers for business. We must encourage, not stifle, small business development.\\" Havard is a member of Rotary International, the Lions Club and the East Feliciana Parish Chamber of Commerce. He is a member of the trade association, the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association. He volunteers for the Easter Seals Foundation. He has been a volunteer youth baseball coach and an appointed member of the Zachary Taylor Parkway Commission. Havard and his wife, the former Shondell Escher, a public schoolteacher in St. Francisville, have two sons. They are affiliated with the historic Grace Episcopal Church in St. Francisville. ==Political career== Havard was elected Parish President of West Feliciana Parish in the primary election held on November 6, 2018 for the position being vacated by Kevin Couhig, who announced his resignation effective December 2018. He will serve through Couhig's unexpired term until December 2019. Havard was elected representative in the general election held on November 19, 2011. The incumbent Tom McVea, a former Democrat-turned Republican was term-limited. Havard defeated the Democrat Ken Dawson, 6,626 (61.4 percent) to 4,170 (38.6 percent). Havard handily won his second term in the House in the primary election held on October 24, 2015. He polled 8,782 votes (63.4 percent) to the Democrat Ronnie Jett's 5,067 ballots (36.6 percent). On May 18, 2016, Havard introduced an amendment to a bill requiring that strippers be over twenty-one years of age. His amendment mandated that strippers also be no more than 28 years old and weigh no more than 160 pounds. He later withdrew the amendment but would not apologize when accused of sexist disrespect by his legislative colleague, Helena Moreno, a Democrat from New Orleans. She claimed that Havard's amendment would have applied equally to male strippers. Havard said that an apology would have meant obeisance to political correctness. An irate Governor John Bel Edwards called Havard's remark \\"in bad taste, and it wasn't funny.\\" The incident attracted national attention. Statewide radio talk show host Moon Griffon has been sharply critical of what he claims is Havard's largely Democratic political philosophy. Though the lawmaker is a registered Republican, he has been conciliatory to policies advanced by Governor John Bel Edwards.The Moon Griffon Show, June 20, 2017. On September 25, 2017, Havard issued a statement calling for the State to end all public funding to the New Orleans Saints NFL football team because of player protests.\\"After Saints players protest, Louisiana Rep. Kenny Havard says team's access to state dollars should be cut\\", The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, accessdate=September 25, 2017 In the race for the West Feliciana Parish presidency, Havard defeated two fellow Republicans, Lauren Field and John Thompson, in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on November 6, 2018. Havard finished with 2,673 votes (58 percent); Field, 1,277 (28 percent) and Thompson, 630 (14 percent. Turnout exceeded 58 percent of registered voters. Sometimes called a \\"Republican in Name Only\\" (RINO), Havard said that he has worked to obtain passage of a balanced budget without causing harm to state services. Havard said that he is frustrated with legislative partisanship and urged legislators to develop \\"the art of compromise. You don‚Äôt get everything you want, they don‚Äôt get everything they want, but you move toward helping people.\\" Two candidates remain in the race to succeed Havard in the state House. Republican Dennis Aucoin finished the first round of balloting with 2,300 votes (45 percent) and faces a runoff with the Independent Roy Daryl Adams, who drew 1,556 (31 percent). ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:People from St. Francisville, Louisiana Category:Businesspeople from Louisiana Category:American Episcopalians Category:Louisiana State University alumni Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Kenny Havard"},{"id":"35864028","text":"Ronald Alan \\"Ron\\" Naslund (born February 28, 1943 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an ice hockey player who played for the American national team.

The senatorial districts (except those in New York City) were made up of entire counties. One hundred and twenty- eight Assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts to a one-year term, with the whole Assembly being renewed annually. The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all in the same county. The City and County of New York was divided into four senatorial districts, and 16 Assembly districts. At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Whig Party. ==Elections== The New York state election of 1852 was held on November 2. Horatio Seymour (D) was elected governor, defeating the incumbent Washington Hunt (W). Lt. Gov. Sanford E. Church (D) was re-elected. The other two statewide elective offices up for election were also carried by the Democrats. ==Sessions== The Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in Albany on January 4, 1853, and adjourned on April 13. William H. Ludlow (D) was elected Speaker with 85 votes against 39 for Jeremiah Ellsworth (W). John S.

An archconfraternity to care for the welfare of Nursian expatriates was set up in Rome in 1615, and it was bequeathed a property on the VIa di Torre Argentina. The already existing house chapel was converted into a church with a separate entrance in 1625, and given the dedication is because St Benedict started his monastic career at Norcia before moving to Montecassino. St Scholastica was his sister, and by tradition was the first Benedictine nun. After 1808, during the French occupation of Rome, the church was looted of its artworks and desecrated. It suffered the same fate under the Roman Republic in 1849. At present it is cherished by its small congregation. ==Exterior== The church is part of a larger building, and hence has no separate architectural identity. It is marked by the interesting and unusual dedicatory inscription over the entrance, which is written in concentric circles within a tondo. This tondo is flanked by two diagonal strips of cornice each with a faint S-curve, and which join to it via tiny volutes. The inscription reads \\"Divis Benedicto et Scholasticae Patronis nursinus ordo et populus\\", which translates as \\"To the honoured patrons Benedict and Scholastica, the council and people of Norcia\\". ==Interior== The single-roomed interior was entirely restored in the 19th century, and could be described as garish in places. The walls are painted to imitate green hanging curtains, with trompe-l'oeil pilasters supporting an entablature with an inscription \\"Felix Nursiae tellus quae talem genuit alumnum\\" or \\"Happy land of Norcia, which gave birth to such a pupil\\". There is a painting of the patrons over the altar, and over that a lunette containing stained glass showing the Madonna and Child being venerated by saints. The Baroque altar has polychrome marble inlay. ==Opening== The church should be open for Mass at 18:30, except Sunday which is 11:00. ==External links== * Official diocesan web-page Category:Roman Catholic churches in Rome Category:National churches in Rome Category:17th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Churches of Rome (rione Sant'Eustachio) ","title":"Santi Benedetto e Scholastica"},{"id":"35864130","text":"Henry Flear (21 January 1818 ‚Äì 16 April 1852) was an English cricketer.

He fled to become a hajduk, then joined the first Serbian uprising under Karaƒëorƒëe in 1804. He fought bravely, but quarreled with his commanding officer and left the army to cross the Danube into Austrian-occupied Srem after the Ottomans recaptured Belgrade. He made his living as a guslar reciting epic poems and, as soon as the Second Serbian Uprising broke out in 1815, he joined the forces of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá.

The band consisted of lead singer Vince Furnier (stage name Alice Cooper), Glen Buxton (lead guitar), Michael Bruce (rhythm guitar, keyboards), Dennis Dunaway (bass guitar), and Neal Smith (drums). Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and has had a solo career under that name since the band became inactive in 1975. The band was notorious for their elaborate, theatrical shock rock stage shows. In 2011, the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After years of obscurity, the Alice Cooper band rose to fame in 1971 with the hit single \\"I'm Eighteen\\" and the album Love It to Death. Success continued with the popular single \\"School's Out\\" and the album of the same name in 1972. The band peaked in popularity in 1973 with their next album Billion Dollar Babies and its tour, which broke box-office records previously held by The Rolling Stones. ==HistoryFormative years: The Spiders=== In 1964, 16-year-old Furnier, then a student at Cortez High School, was eager to participate in the local annual Letterman's talent show, so he gathered four fellow teammates from his high school's cross-country team to form a group for the show: Glen Buxton, Dennis Dunaway, John Tatum and John Speer.Cooper describes in detail in his first autobiography, Me, Alice, how he was tasked with organizing an act for the show. They named themselves The Earwigs.Harkima, Reginald, Scott McFayden and Sam Dunn, dir. Super Duper Alice Cooper. Banger Films, 2014. DVD. They dressed up in costumes and wigs to resemble the Beatles, and performed several parodies of Beatles songs, with the lyrics modified to refer to the track team: in their rendition of \\"Please Please Me\\", for example, the line \\"Last night I said these words to my girl\\" was replaced with \\"Last night I ran four laps for my coach\\". Of the group, only Buxton and Tatum knew how to play an instrument‚Äîthe guitar‚Äîso Buxton and Tatum played guitars while the rest mimed on their instruments. The group got an overwhelming response from the audience and won the talent show. As a result of their positive experience, the group decided to try to turn into a real band. They acquired musical instruments from a local pawn shop, and proceeded to learn how to play them, with Buxton doing most of the teaching, as well as much of the early songwriting. They soon renamed themselves The Spiders, featuring Furnier on vocals, Buxton on lead guitar, Tatum on rhythm guitar, Dunaway on bass guitar, and Speer on drums. Musically, the group was inspired by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, the Doors, and the Yardbirds. For the next year the band performed regularly around the Phoenix area with a huge black spider's web as their backdrop, the group's first stage prop. In 1965, the Spiders recorded their first single, \\"Why Don't You Love Me\\" (originally performed by the Blackwells), with Furnier learning the harmonica for the song. The single's B-side track was the Marvin Gaye Tamla Records hit, \\"Hitch Hike\\". The single was released by local record label, Mascot Records, owned by Jack Curtis, a concert promoter who also owned the Stage 7 teen club which later became the VIP Club where the Spiders were the house band. In 1966, the Spiders graduated from high school and after North High School footballer Michael Bruce replaced John Tatum on rhythm guitar, the band released their second single, \\"Don't Blow Your Mind\\", an original composition which became a local #1 hit, backed by \\"No Price Tag\\". The single was recorded at Copper State Recording Studio and issued by local micro-imprint, Santa Cruz Records. By 1967, the band had begun to make regular road trips to Los Angeles to play shows. They soon renamed themselves Nazz and released the single \\"Wonder Who's Lovin' Her Now\\", backed with future Alice Cooper track \\"Lay Down and Die, Goodbye\\". At around this time, drummer John Speer was replaced by Neal Smith. By the end of the year, the band had relocated to Los Angeles. In 1968, the band learned that Todd Rundgren also had a band called Nazz, and found themselves in need of another stage name. Furnier also believed that the group needed a gimmick to succeed, and that other bands were not exploiting the showmanship potential of the stage. The legend is that the name \\"Alice Cooper\\" came from a session with a Ouija board, largely chosen because it sounded innocuous and wholesome, in humorous contrast to the band's image and music. However, in an interview with Mark Radcliffe on the Radcliffe and Maconie show on BBC Radio 2 on 30 November 2009 Alice described the incident with the ouija board as an urban legend. He said \\"We literally got that whole story about the witch thing the way you guys got it. It was like just pure urban legend. I heard about the witch thing probably the same day you did, but it was a great story.\\"The Radcliffe and Maconie Show.\\" Guest Alice Cooper. BBC Radio 2. Episode 30 November 2009. \\"Alice Cooper\\" was a character on Mayberry R.F.D. (played by Alice Ghostley) at the time, probably coincidentally. Eventually Furnier adopted this stage name as his own. He later stated that the name change was one of his most important and successful career moves. The classic Alice Cooper group line-up consisted of Furnier, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, rhythm guitarist Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway and drummer Neal Smith ‚Äì all former members of the Spiders. This lineup stayed intact well into the 1970s. After a 1968 gig at the Cheetah club in Venice, California, where most of the club's patrons left after hearing the band play just ten minutes, they were approached by music manager Shep Gordon, who saw the band's negative impact that night as a force that could be turned in a more productive direction.Super Duper Alice Cooper. Dir. Reginald Harkima, Scott McFayden, and Sam Dunn. Banger Films in association with Eagle Rock Entertainment, the Movie Network, and Movie Central. 2014 ‚Äì documentary Shep arranged an audition for the band with renowned musical artist and record producer Frank Zappa, who was looking to sign bizarre music acts to his new record label, Straight Records. Zappa told them to come to his house \\"at 7 o'clock\\" for an audition. The band mistakenly assumed he meant 7 o'clock in the morning. Being woken up by a band willing to play that particular brand of music at seven in the morning impressed Zappa enough for him to sign them to a three-album deal. \\"Frank was the only one who stuck out his neck for us, for me,\\" recalled Alice himself. \\"He was the one who said, 'Here's a band that everybody in the business is laughing at ‚Äì I like 'em.' ‚Ä¶ He was the outcast in L.A. and so were we.\\" The first three Alice Cooper albums were released on Zappa's Straight label. Another Zappa-signed act, the all-female GTOs, were encouraged to dress up the Alice Cooper band members in women's clothing and heavy makeup, and played a major role in developing the band's early onstage look. The band was the subject of media criticism after Furnier threw a live chicken into the audience during the 1969 Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival Festival. The audience ripped the chicken to shreds.Howell, Peter. \\"Toronto 'chicken incident' sparked rage\\". Toronto Star, 24 April 2014. In 1970, the band appeared on a Warner Bros sampler album, Zapped, featuring acts produced by Zappa. ===Finding success=== Slow sales of the band's first two albums, as well as Californians' indifference to their act, led the band to relocate again in 1970, this time to Pontiac, Michigan near Furnier's original home town of Detroit. Here, their bizarre stage act was much better received by Midwestern crowds accustomed to the proto punk styles of local bands such as the Stooges and the MC5. \\"L.A. just didn‚Äôt get it,\\" Furnier stated. \\"They were all on the wrong drug for us. They were on acid and we were basically drinking beer. We fit much more in Detroit than we did anywhere else.\\" Hooking up with young producer Bob Ezrin, Alice Cooper released the single \\"I'm Eighteen\\" in late 1970, and it became a surprise Top 40 hit. The single's success convinced Warner Bros that the band could be a viable commercial act, leading to much stronger investment in the third Alice Cooper album, Love It to Death. The album was initially released on Straight Records, but was reissued on the Warner label following its buyout of the imprint from Zappa, giving Alice Cooper even greater exposure. Under Ezrin's direction, the band's sound moved from psychedelic rock to a tighter, guitar-driven hard rock sound, even as much of the lyrical content continued to explore \\"decadence, perversion and psychosis.\\" With Love It to Death and its follow-up album Killer both charting well, the band was able to afford a more elaborate stage show, including sophisticated props and elements of gothic horror, and they became a highly popular concert attraction in the US and UK over the next few years. Calls by members of British Parliament in 1972 to have the group banned from performing in the UK only solidified the band's legend, and the next year's Billion Dollar Babies tour broke box office records. Cindy Dunaway (Neal Smith's sister who married Dennis Dunaway) designed the band's costumes and occasionally performed in the stage show (she was the \\"dancing tooth\\" on the Billion Dollar Babies tour).Walker, Michael. What You Want Is in the Limo: On the Road With Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, and the Who in 1973, the Year the Sixties Died and the Modern Rock Star Was Born. Random House LLC, 2013. Following Killer, Alice Cooper released three more top ten albums, the pinnacle being 1973's Billion Dollar Babies which rose all the way to No. 1 on the US and UK album charts. The band headlined highly successful tours from 1972 to 1974, before breaking up. ===Breakup of the original band=== The original Alice Cooper band played their final show on April 8, 1974 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There are varying reasons former band members have given for the breakup. Smith said the members wanted to take a year off to slow down and possibly do solo projects, and just never reunited. Cooper said there was disagreement over how much money to sink back into stage shows, which had become costly. Bruce contends that Buxton's issues with substance abuse, which at one time led him to pull a switchblade on the band's tour manager, likely hastened the breakup. The breakup was made public in 1975. Vincent Furnier took \\"Alice Cooper\\" as his own name and carried on as a solo artist with a new group of musicians,Edmonson, Jacqueline. \\"Cooper, Alice (1948 ‚Äì )\\".Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture. ABC-CLIO, 2013. the original band becoming officially defunct. Furnier later stated that the name change was one of his most important and successful career moves. The four surviving original members of Alice Cooper at Wembley Arena in November 2017 Bruce, Dunaway and Smith would go on to form the short-lived band Billion Dollar Babies, producing one album ‚Äì Battle Axe ‚Äì in 1977. While occasionally performing with one another and Glen Buxton, they would not reunite with Alice until October 23, 1999, at the second Glen Buxton Memorial Weekend for a show at CoopersTown in Phoenix (Buxton having died in 1997). They reunited for another show, with Steve Hunter on guitar, on December 16, 2010, at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix. This lineup would perform together again (televised) on March 14, 2011, at the induction of the original Alice Cooper group into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as on May 11, 2011, at London's Battersea Power Station at the J√§germeister Ice Cold 4D event (webcast). Bruce, Dunaway and Smith appeared on three tracks they co-wrote on Alice's 2011 album Welcome 2 My Nightmare. A documentary about the band entitled Super Duper Alice Cooper premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 17, 2014, and was scheduled to be screened at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival a week later. On October 6, 2015, a surprise reunion show took place in Dallas at Dunaway's book signing session. He was joined by Bruce, Smith, Cooper and Ryan Roxie, who replaced the late Glen Buxton. The surviving members of the band were set to record and release an album. However, the only material to surface was two bonus tracks on Cooper's 27th studio album Paranormal. The four surviving original members reunited again for a five-song set on May 14, 2017, at a show in Nashville, Tennessee. The four reunited yet again later that same year for a UK tour. ==Band members== Vincent Furnier a.k.a. Alice Cooper Original band members * Vincent Furnier a.k.a.

It held both legislative and judicial power but no executive power was present in the country. *Union with Norway (1262‚Äì1814) **When Iceland became a dependency of Norway, the legislative power of the parliament was shared with the king of Norway who ruled through his officials. Laws adopted by the parliament were subject to royal assent and, conversely, if the king initiated legislation, the parliament had to give its consent. *Danish monarchy (1380‚Äì1944) **Norway falls under the control the Danish monarchy and Iceland along with it. The parliament served almost exclusively as a court of law until the year 1800 when it was disbanded by royal decree. **A royal decree providing for the reestablishment of the parliament was issued on 8 March 1843. Elections were held the following year and the assembly finally met on 1 July 1845. The parliament functioned however only as a consultative assembly. *Constitution of Iceland (1874) **The constitution of 1874 granted to the parliament joint legislative power with the crown in matters of exclusive Icelandic concern. The king retained the right to veto legislation and often, on the advice of his ministers, refused to consent to legislation adopted by the parliament. **The parliament began meeting in the newly built Parliament House in 1881 and has done so ever since. **A constitutional amendment, confirmed on 3 October 1903, granted Icelanders home rule and parliamentary government. **After 1915 standing committees began operating in the parliament for the first time.

As Office Director, McNeilly can order police investigations, searches, seizures, and can \\"subpoena documents and witnesses, including chiefs of police\\" under the Public Inquiries Act. He can recommend, but not order disciplinary action against officers or that police procedure be changed. Prior to the creation of the Office, complaints about police were \\"handled internally\\" by police departments. In its first six months the OIPRD handled 2,400 complaints. One of his largest and highest-profile investigations was the review of police conduct during the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit in response to 300 complaints. McNeilly was the lead author on the OIPRD's 208-page report entitled \\"Broken Trust: Indigenous People and the Thunder Bay Police Service\\" which was released in December 2018. The report concluded that TBPS needed to \\"improve its relationship with Indigenous communities\\" and that it needs to \\"ensure that its investigations are timely, effective and non-discriminatory. ==Controversy== The position of the OIRPD director was assumed by the prior deputy director Sylvana Capogreco in an interim capacity effective April 1, 2019. The decision to end his directorship before finding a permanent replacement raises questions as to its relation to the Divisional Court finding that he changed the decision of a complaint against Toronto Police Service (TPS) Constable Chris Howes from substantiated to unsubstantiated after he had communications with the TPS outside of the complaint process.\\" ==References== Category:Lawyers in Ontario Category:York University alumni Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni ","title":"Gerry McNeilly"},{"id":"35864369","text":"Jos√© de Jes√∫s Robinson Gonz√°lez (born 14 February 1945 in Reynosa, Tamaulipas) is a Mexican former diver who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics, in the 1968 Summer Olympics, and in the 1972 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican male divers Category:Olympic divers of Mexico Category:Divers at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Divers at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Divers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Tamaulipas Category:People from Reynosa, Tamaulipas Category:Pan American Games medalists in diving Category:Pan American Games bronze medalists for Mexico Category:Divers at the 1971 Pan American Games ","title":"Jos√© Robinson"},{"id":"35864371","text":"Jimmy Green (born August 6, 1969) is an American professional golfer.

He was also commander-in-chief of the Cadets of the Republic, the official youth organization within the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. This quasi-military organization was also known as the Ej√©rcito Libertador de Puerto Rico (The Liberation Army of Puerto Rico). On October 30, 1950, a series of revolts occurred in scattered locations in Puerto Rico in opposition to U.S. colonial rule. These were known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party revolts. On that day of October 30, D√≠az Pacheco led an armed attack on La Fortaleza, the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico in San Juan, with the intent to assassinate Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. D√≠az Pacheco was shot dead in the unsuccessful attempt. ==Early years== D√≠az Pacheco was born in the barrio of Carra√≠zo in the municipality of Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico, where he received his primary and secondary education. D√≠az Pacheco and his five siblings were believers in the cause of Puerto Rican independence and, in 1924, joined the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico.\\"FBI Files\\"; \\"Puerto Rico Nationalist Party\\"; SJ 100-3; Vol. 23; pages 104-134. 1924 was also the year that Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was named vice-president. By 1930, there were disagreements between Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠, founder of the Nationalist Party, and Albizu Campos as to how the party should be run. Coll y Cuchi and his followers abandoned the party and on May 11, 1930, Albizu Campos was elected president. Under Albizu Campos's leadership during the years of the Great Depression, the party became the largest independence movement in Puerto Rico. However, by the mid-1930s, after disappointing electoral results and strong repression by the territorial police authorities, Albizu Campos opted against electoral participation and advocated direct, violent revolution. ==Cadets of the Republic== In the 1920s, there was a non-political student organization in the University of Puerto Rico called Patriotas Jovenes (Young Patriots). By the 1930s, the members of this organization were influenced by the teachings of Albizu Campos. They adopted the Nationalist Party's independence ideals, and dismissed any student who would not swear allegiance to them. The organization was renamed Cadetes de la Republica (Cadets of the Republic) and Joaquin Rodriguez, a Nationalist, was placed in charge. D√≠az Pacheco and his brother Faustino were active members of the cadets. The organization became the official youth branch of the Nationalist Party. In accordance with the beliefs of Albizu Campos, organization and discipline were considered the keys to victory, in the struggle for Puerto Rico's independence. Cadets were required to wear a uniform of white pants and gloves, and everything else - the shirt, tie, belt, boots, military cap - was black. Officers wore a white jacket over the black shirt and tie, and a white officer's cap. The cadets were divided into companies, each of which represented a different town in Puerto Rico. They were all required to participate in local and national acts, such as the celebration of Jos√© de Diego's birthday. All of the cadets received military training which included marching, field tactics, self-defense and survival. ==Ponce massacre== On April 3, 1936, a Federal Grand Jury submitted accusations against Pedro Albizu Campos, Juan Antonio Corretjer, Luis F. Vel√°zquez, Clemente Soto V√©lez, Erasmo Vel√°zquez, Julio H. Vel√°zquez, Rafael Ortiz Pacheco, Juan Gallardo Santiago, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz. They were charged with sedition and other violations of Title 18 of the United States Code.FBI Files on Puerto Ricans Title 18 of the United States Code is the criminal and penal code of the federal government of the United States. It deals with federal crimes and criminal procedure.[*text of Title 18 Chapter 601 Immunity for witnesses, via findlaw.com] Carlos Torres Morales, a photo journalist for the newspaper El Imparcial, was covering the march and took this photograph when the shooting began. The photo was sent to U.S. Congress. On March 21, 1937, a Palm Sunday, the cadets were to participate in a peaceful march scheduled in the city of Ponce. The march had been organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873. The march was also protesting the imprisonment, by the U.S. government, of Nationalist leader Albizu Campos on alleged sedition charges.\\"Latino Americans and Political Participation: A Reference Handbook\\". By Sharon Ann Navarro and Armando Xavier Mejia. 2004. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC‚ÄìCLIO, Inc. D√≠az Pacheco, who by then was the Comandante (Commander) of the Cadets of the Republic, and his brother Faustino were present when this peaceful march turned into the bloody police slaughter, which became known as the Ponce massacre. Several days before the scheduled Palm Sunday march, the organizers received legal permits for a peaceful protest from Jos√© Tormos Diego, the mayor of Ponce. However, upon learning of the planned protest, the colonial governor of Puerto Rico General Blanton Winship, who had been appointed by US president Franklin D. Roosevelt, demanded the immediate withdrawal of the permits. Without notice to the organizers, or any opportunity to appeal, or any time to arrange an alternate venue, the permits were abruptly withdrawn just before the protest was scheduled to begin. \\"Viva la Republica, Abajo los Asesinos\\" message which cadet Bolivar Marquez Telechea wrote with his blood before he died As La Borinque√±a, Puerto Rico's national song, was being played, the demonstrators - which included the cadets, led by Tom√°s L√≥pez de Victoria, the Captain of the Ponce branch and the women's branch of the Nationalist Party known as the Hijas de la Libertad (Daughters of Freedom) - began to march. Empowered by the North American police chief, and encouraged by the governor, the police fired for over 15 minutes from four different positions. They fired with impunity on the cadets and bystanders alike - killing men, women and children. The flag-bearer of the cadets was shot and killed during the massacre. A young girl by the name of Carmen Fern√°ndez proceeded to take the flag, but was shot and gravely injured. A young cadet by the name of Bol√≠var M√°rquez, despite being mortally wounded, dragged himself to a wall and wrote with his blood the following message before he succumbed to his wounds:The Ponce Massacre, why is it important to remember? Nineteen people were killed, and about 235 were wounded. The dead included 17 men, one woman, and a seven-year-old girl. Some of the dead were demonstrators, while others were simply passers-by. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, told reporters how a policeman murdered a nationalist with his bare hands. Dr. Jos√© N. G√°ndara, one of the physicians who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot, and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police. No arms were found in the hands of the civilians wounded, nor on the dead ones. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail. On June 7, 1937, Albizu Campos and the other leaders of the Nationalist Party were transferred to the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, by order of federal judge Robert A. Cooper. The next day, D√≠az Pacheco participated in an assassination attempt on Judge Cooper, in retaliation for Cooper's rigging the jury with ten North Americans and only two Puerto Ricans,Albizu Campos: Puerto Rican Revolutiionary; Federico Ribes Tovar (1971); p. 64 and for sentencing the Nationalist leadership to long prison terms. D√≠az Pacheco together with nine other Nationalists were arrested and accused of attempting against the life of Judge Cooper. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt became involved when on October 22, 1937, he signed Executive Order Number 7731 designating Martin Travieso, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, to perform and discharge the duties of Judge of the District Court of the United States for Puerto Rico in the trial against the Nationalists. Thereby, permitting judge Cooper to serve as a Government witness.Executive Order 7731 - DESIGNATING THE HONORABLE MARTIN TRAVIESO AS ACTING JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR PUERTO RICO FOR THE TRIAL OF THE CASE OF UNITED STATES v. JULIO PINTO GANDIA, ET AL D√≠az Pacheco and his comrades were found guilty of the charges against them and were imprisoned. ==Puerto Rico's Gag Law (Law 53)== After D√≠az Pacheco was released from prison, he resumed his role as Commander of the Cadets. Unbeknownst to him, his brother Faustino had abandoned the Nationalist Party in 1939, and had turned into an informant for the FBI. Albizu Campos returned to Puerto Rico in 1947, after having been incarcerated for 10 years in Atlanta. D√≠az Pacheco and the cadets were among those who greeted him. Albizu Campos named D√≠az Pacheco Treasurer General of the party. Thus, D√≠az Pacheco now served as both Comandante (Commander) of the Cadets of the Republic, and as Treasurer General of the party. As Treasurer General he was responsible for all the funds received by the municipal treasurers of the party. On May 21, 1948, the Puerto Rican legislature, which was presided over by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n approved Law 53. The law which is also known as Ley de la Mordaza or \\"Puerto Rico's Gag Law\\" was signed into law on June 10, 1948 by the U.S.- appointed governor Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero. The law's main objective was to suppress the independence movement in Puerto Rico. The law made it a crime to own or display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a patriotic tune, to speak or write of independence, or meet with anyone, or hold any assembly, with regard to the political status of Puerto Rico.\\"Jaime Ben√≠tez y la autonom√≠a universitaria\\"; by: Mary Frances Gallart; Publisher: CreateSpace; ; Ley N√∫m. 282 del a√±o 2006 ==Puerto Rican Nationalist Party revolts of the 1950s== The 296th Regiment of the U.S. National Guard occupy Jayuya Various incidents between the government and the party led to call for an armed revolt by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party against United States Government rule over Puerto Rico. The revolts specifically repudiated the so-called \\"Free Associated State\\" (Estado Libre Asociado) designation of Puerto Rico - a designation that the nationalist considered a colonial farce. The revolts began on October 30, 1950, upon the orders of Nationalist leader Albizu Campos, with uprisings in various towns, among them Pe√±uelas, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo and Ponce. The most notable uprisings occurred in Utuado, Jayuya, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.Law Library Microform Consortium \\"El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza\\"; by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez; Page 2; Publisher: Publicaciones REN√â; ==San Juan Nationalist revolt== D√≠az Pacheco was in charge of the San Juan revolt. The objective of the revolt was to assassinate the Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, at his residence La Fortaleza. Early in the morning of October 30, Nationalists Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Gregorio Hern√°ndez and Manuel Torres Medina met at the house of D√≠az Pacheco, in the San Juan sector of Mart√≠n Pe√±a. At 11 A.M., they boarded a green Plymouth and headed towards Old San Juan. The men arrived at La Fortaleza at noon and stopped their car 25 feet from their objective's main entrance\\"El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza\\"; by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez; Page 4; Publisher: Publicaciones REN√â; They got out of the car with a submachine gun and pistols in hand and immediately began firing at the mansion. D√≠az Pacheco headed towards the mansion while the others took cover close to their car, and fired pistols from their positions. The bodies of Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Manuel Torres Medina lie on the ground, after their attack on La Fortaleza The Fortaleza guards and police, who knew of the planned attack thanks to a double agent named E. Rivera Orellana, were already in defensive positions and returned fire. D√≠az Pacheco aimed his sub machine gun fire at the second floor of the mansion, where the executive offices of Governor Mu√±oz Mar√≠n were located. During the firefight D√≠az Pacheco wounded two police officers, Isidoro Ramos and Vicente Otero D√≠az, before he was killed by Fortaleza guard Carmelo D√°vila. Meanwhile, the police continued to fire upon the other Nationalists. Domingo Hiraldo Resto was seriously wounded, but despite his wounds he dragged himself towards the mansions entrance. He was able to reach the mansions main door and once there he was motionless and appeared to be dead. He suddenly turned and sat on the steps and with his hands held up pleaded for mercy, his pleas however, were answered with a fusillade of gunfire.El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza; by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez; Page 7; Publisher: Publicaciones REN√â; Hern√°ndez, who was also severely wounded, continued firing at the police from under his car. A police officer and a detective from La Fortaleza with submachine guns approached the car and fired upon Hern√°ndez, Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Torres Medina. Both Carlos Hiraldo Resto and Torres Medina were killed, and their motionless bodies were by the right side of the car. Hern√°ndez was believed to be dead, however he wasn't, and he was taken to the local hospital along with the wounded police officers where they were operated on for their respective wounds. The battle lasted 15 minutes and at the end of the battle there were five nationalist casualties (four dead and one wounded) plus three wounded police officers. E. Rivera Orellana, a sixth \\"Nationalist\\" who later turned out to be an undercover agent, was arrested near La Fortaleza and later released. ==Aftermath== The revolt failed because of the overwhelming force used by the US military and Puerto Rican police forces against the Nationalists. Hundreds of Nationalists were arrested and the party was never the same. Law 53, the Gag Law (or La Ley de la Mordaza as it is known in Puerto Rico), was repealed in 1957. In 1964, David M. Helfeld wrote in his article Discrimination for Political Beliefs and Associations that Law 53 was written with the explicit intent of eliminating the leaders of the Nationalist and other pro-independence movements, and to intimidate anyone who might follow them - even if their speeches were reasonable and orderly, and their activities were peaceful.\\"Discrimination for Political Beliefs and Associations\\"; Helfeld, D.

The law would automatically classify all people who relinquished U.S. citizenship or permanent residence in the decade prior to the law's passage or any future year as having \\"tax avoidance intent\\" if they met certain asset or tax liability thresholds or had failed to file any required federal tax forms within the preceding five years. People determined to have \\"tax avoidance intent\\", referred to in the text of the law as specified expatriates, would be affected in two ways. First, they would have to pay 30% capital gains tax on any U.S. property sold after the law's enactment. Second, they would be barred from re-entry into the U.S. either under immigrant or non-immigrant categories. The Ex-PATRIOT Act was first introduced as S. 3205 in the 112th Congress in 2012 by Senator Chuck Schumer and four co-sponsors, but died in committee. Schumer and two other senators moved similar provisions in the 113th Congress as Senate Amendment 1252 to a major immigration reform bill, but their amendment was not included in the version of the bill that passed the Senate. ==History== The short title of the Ex-PATRIOT Act is a backronym for \\"Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy Act\\". The long title of the Ex-PATRIOT Act as given in its Section 1 is: :A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that persons renouncing citizenship for a substantial tax avoidance purpose shall be subject to tax and withholding on capital gains, to provide that such persons shall not be admissible to the United States, and for other purposes. It was sponsored by Chuck Schumer (D-New York) with initial co- sponsors Bob Casey Jr. (D-Pennsylvania), Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). It was introduced on May 17, 2012 and referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, of which Schumer is a member (on the Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, among other subcommittees). Schumer's fellow Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight member Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) joined as an additional co-sponsor on May 23. The introduction of the Ex- PATRIOT Act was motivated by the news that Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin had renounced his U.S. citizenship. Saverin, a native of Brazil, lived in the U.S. from 1992 to 2009 before moving to Singapore. While living in Singapore, he continued to pay U.S. taxes, as the U.S. is one of the only countries which imposes tax on non-resident citizens. In January 2011, he began the procedure to renounce U.S. citizenship in favor of retaining his existing Brazilian citizenship; he did not apply to take up Singaporean citizenship. His loss of citizenship was effective from September 2011. On April 30, 2012, his name was published in the Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate in the Federal Register as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The story was reported in Bloomberg Businessweek and other news outlets roughly ten days later. The Ex- PATRIOT Act bill received additional coverage in July 2012 when it was revealed that singer-songwriter Denise Rich had renounced her citizenship as well. However the Senate Committee on Finance did not take any action on the bill by the end of the session. On June 12, 2013, Casey moved Senate Amendment 1252 to the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, a major immigration reform bill. His co-sponsors for the amendment were Schumer and Jack Reed (D-RI). The text of the amendment was identical to that of Schumer's Ex-PATRIOT Act the previous year. In a press release about the amendment, Reed stated, \\"American citizenship is a privilege. But it seems that a privileged few are trying to game the system by accumulating wealth and benefiting from the greatness of the United States and then renouncing their citizenship to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. They are welcome to leave our country, but they should not be welcomed to return without playing by the rules and paying what they owe.\\" The immigration reform bill passed the Senate on June 27, 2013 without the inclusion of Casey's amendment. ==EffectsTax law=== Under current law, imposes an expatriation tax on \\"covered expatriates\\". The term \\"covered expatriates\\" is defined in as former citizens or long-term residents whose world-wide assets exceeded $2 million, whose five-year average tax liability exceeded $148,000, or who could not certify that they complied with their U.S. tax obligations for the five years preceding their loss of citizenship. The tax is equivalent to the 15% capital gains tax that would be paid on a sale at the marked-to- market value of all of the former citizen's property. When Saverin renounced, he had to pay that expatriation tax. Going forward, under existing law he receives similar treatment to other non-resident aliens: he is exempt from U.S. capital gains tax on U.S. investments, but is subject to a 30% withholding tax on U.S.-source dividends and interest payments. He is no longer subject to U.S. gift or estate taxes; however, imposes an equivalent inheritance tax on U.S. citizen or U.S. resident heirs of covered expatriates. Section 2 of the Ex-PATRIOT Act amends to impose new taxes on certain \\"covered expatriates\\". In the new Subparagraph C, it defines the term \\"specified expatriate\\", a subset of \\"covered expatriate\\". A \\"specified expatriate\\" is defined in clause (i) as any \\"covered expatriate\\" who lost citizenship or permanent residence within the ten-year period before the bill's date of enactment, as well as future \\"covered expatriates\\". Clause (ii) exempts those who prove that their loss of citizenship \\"did not result in a substantial reduction in taxes\\". The new subparagraph A provides for the imposition of capital gains tax on \\"specified expatriates\\" at the same 30% rate as non- resident aliens who are present in the United States for more than 183 days in a tax year. Subparagraph B provides that the tax basis of a \\"specified expatriate\\" in U.S. property shall be the value of that property on the day preceding loss of citizenship. ===Immigration law=== Since 1996, INA ¬ß 212(a)(10)(E) (commonly known as the Reed Amendment) makes former citizens inadmissible to the United States if the Attorney General determines that they gave up citizenship to avoid taxation; however, it has never been enforced because the Attorney General is not empowered to obtain the required information in order to make that determination. There was speculation that the Reed Amendment might be enforced against Saverin, and Reed Amendment author Senator Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) wrote to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to urge that Saverin be barred from entering to the United States; however, Schumer stated that the Reed Amendment lacked an enforcement mechanism, and that his newly proposed Ex-PATRIOT Act was necessary to remedy this. Section 3 of the Ex-PATRIOT Act amends INA ¬ß 212(a)(10)(E), striking the whole text of the Reed Amendment and replacing it. The new clause (i) makes \\"specified expatriates\\" inadmissible. The new clause (iii) requires the Secretary of Treasury to notify the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security of the name of each \\"covered expatriate\\" who has been determined not to be a \\"specified expatriate\\". Section 3 of the Ex-PATRIOT Act also amends INA ¬ß 212(d)(3) to make the Secretary of Homeland Security and not the Attorney General responsible for processing waivers of inadmissibility for \\"specified expatriates\\" seeking admission to the U.S. as non-immigrants. ==ReactionsLegislators=== Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who was at the time the ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Finance, stated in an interview that while he was unfamiliar with Schumer's proposed legislation, \\"[i]t always bothers me when somebody renounces his citizenship in the greatest country on Earth just to save money, save taxes ... I was really upset at Eduardo Saverin for doing that, and there are others who are doing it too.\\" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) described Saverin's action as \\"absolutely outrageous\\" and spoke favorably of the concept of Schumer's bill, but also stated that existing legislation should be sufficient to punish Saverin. In contrast, Ron Paul (R-Texas) expressed opposition to the Ex-PATRIOT Act, stating that it \\"will ensnare many ordinary middle-class Americans\\" due to inflation and that \\"control[ling] people by controlling their capital ... has no place in a free society\\". ===Others=== Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times supporting the Ex-PATRIOT Act, stating that former citizens \\"should be allowed to return only under exceptional circumstances ... [T]hey either remain Americans or they repudiate their homeland forever\\". Matthew Yglesias wrote in Slate that the proposal \\"seems very reasonable\\", though he also parodied the more extreme reactions to Saverin's renunciation with a \\"modest proposal\\" that former citizens should be subject to targeted killing by drone attacks. Columnist Ruben Navarette also criticized Saverin for his \\"cavalier\\" renunciation while \\"hundreds of thousands of undocumented DREAM Act students\\" suffered due to their own lack of U.S. citizenship. Conor Friedersdorf, writing in The Atlantic, stated that \\"it is imprudent to impulsively introduce legislation in order to target a specific high profile individual who happens to be making news, especially when doing so punishes him in a way he couldn't have anticipated for doing something that was legal. Anyone who doesn't grok that much philosophy of law doesn't deserve to be in Congress.\\" Americans for Tax Reform president Grover Norquist spoke out against the Ex-PATRIOT Act in stronger terms, comparing it to Nazi Germany's Reich Flight Tax and East Germany's treatment of emigrants. Canadian theologian Peter W. Dunn, himself a former U.S. citizen, argued in the American Thinker that the Ex-PATRIOT Act's imposition of a form of exile on Saverin would violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights' guarantee that everyone has the right to change his or her nationality, as well as the Expatriation Act of 1868. Schumer responded angrily to the criticism by Forbes, the American Thinker, the National Review, Norquist, and others in a speech on the Senate floor on May 24, 2012. Saverin himself issued a statement through his spokesman Tom Goodman stating that he was \\"obligated to and will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the United States government\\" and that he felt it was \\"unfortunate that my personal choice has led to a public debate, based not on the facts but entirely on speculation and misinformation\\". ==References * on THOMAS * on THOMAS *S. 3205 on GovTrack *Bob Casey's letter to John Boehner thanking him for his support of the Ex-PATRIOT Act *Transcript of an additional speech by Chuck Schumer about the Ex-PATRIOT Act, from the Congressional Record of May 24, 2012 Category:Proposed legislation of the 112th United States Congress Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Exile Category:United States proposed federal immigration and nationality legislation Category:United States proposed federal taxation legislation ","title":"Ex-PATRIOT Act"},{"id":"35864601","text":"Mordellistena callens is a beetle in the genus Mordellistena of the family Mordellidae.

He won two World University (FISU) Games Gold Medals, was Silver Medalist on 3 meter in the 1963 Pan American Games and amassed five Big Ten and seven national titles while at Indiana University. He was a six-time NCAA All-American and four-time AAU All-American and won one NCAA and six national AAU titles. Gilbert was on the 1968 United States Olympic Team that competed in Mexico City. After Mexico City, he became coach of diving at Cornell University where he coached 39 years until his retirement in 2007. Gilbert was named Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming League Women‚Äôs Diving Coach of the Year in 1991, 1992 and 1993 and Men‚Äôs Diving Coach of the Year in 1984. He was Chairman of the NCAA Diving Rules Sub-Committee from 1976 to 1980. He was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1973, the Indiana University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997, and into the Pennsylvania Aquatics Hall of Fame in 2019. ==High School== Gilbert graduated from McCaskey High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he was a three- time PIAA state diving champion and two-time Eastern Interscholastic Champion. Gilbert only lost one high school meet during his four years of high school when he finished second, seven tenths of a point behind the winner. He was 7th in the one meter National AAU Championships held at Yale University his senior year in high school. After graduating in 1962, Gilbert enrolled at Indiana University. He was named to the McCaskey High School Hall of Fame in October, 1987. ==At Indiana University== Gilbert dived for the legendary coach Hobie Billingsley at Indiana, after being heavily recruited to become the cornerstone of Billingsley‚Äôs emerging program. While Gilbert was the cornerstone, his success enabled Billingsley to attract additional top-tier divers including Lesley Bush, Ken Sitzberger, Cynthia Potter, Win Young, Jim Henry and Mark Lenzi. Despite the fact that Indiana was on probation when Gilbert was recruited, he chose Indiana after being assured by 1956 Olympic springboard Champion Bobby Clotworthy that Hobie and the Hoosiers were an emerging force. In 1962, Gilbert won the AAU 3-meter title, the first freshman in 25 years to win the event. At the time, freshmen were ineligible for Varsity collegiate NCAA competition. In his junior season, Gilbert became Big Ten champion on both one and 3-meter boards, and the NCAA 1-meter champion, both of which were Billingsley and Indiana University firsts. He repeated his Big Ten sweep as a senior. Gilbert amassed five Big Ten and one NCAA title while at Indiana, plus six national AAU titles. He was a three year collegiate All-American. Gilbert was named a member of the Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1997, having won diving letters in 1963, 1964, and 1965. His cumulative awards during his Indiana years included six NCAA All-American Honors, four NAAU All-American Honors, one and 3-meter Big Ten titles, the NCAA 1-meter championship in 1964, and four NAAU indoor and two NAAU outdoor titles, in addition to the 3-meter and 10-meter titles at the World University (FISU) Games in Budapest in 1965, and the 3- meter Silver medal in the 1963 Pan American Games. ==1968 U.S. Olympic Team== After narrowly missing the team for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Gilbert was named to the 1968 Olympic team for the 10-meter platform. While in Mexico City awaiting the start of the Games, he sprained his ankle, but still managed to place 17th after initially being favored to finish much higher. ==At Cornell University== Rick provided 39 years of distinguished service to Cornell University athletics where he coached and inspired generations of Cornell divers, while guiding the athletic and academic demands of Cornell‚Äôs student athletes. His divers won 12 Eastern titles and four earned All-American status. Gilbert was named Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming League Women‚Äôs Diving Coach of the Year in 1991, 1992 and 1993 and Men‚Äôs Diving Coach of the Year in 1984. He was Chairman of the NCAA Diving Rules Sub-Committee from 1976 to 1981. As a result of Gilbert‚Äôs influence on the sport and the many students, Bob and Maura Dughi named ‚ÄúThe Richard W. Gilbert Diving Coach‚Äù chair in Gilbert‚Äôs honor, and permanently endowed Cornell‚Äôs diving coach position. It was not only Cornell students who dived with Gilbert over 39 years. Starting in the early 1970‚Äôs, he created the Rick Gilbert Diving Camp. This nationally recognized camp attracted age group and high school students from all over the country. There were national and international caliber divers who went to train with Gilbert during the summer and school year, including Phil Boggs, a 1976 Olympic Gold Medalist. These divers benefited from Gilbert‚Äôs tutelage and included many future Cornell divers. ==Personal Impact and Legacy== One of Gilbert‚Äôs most direct impacts is that many of his divers have gone on to coach diving themselves, paying back some of what Rick modeled and taught. Gilbert‚Äôs coaching was not just on the board, but also emphasized family, and specifically development of the diving family. He and his wife, Jo, opened their hearts and home to the divers and established a unique bond among them, regardless of when their time was spent in his programs. This included the admirable quality of being able to leave his ego behind and focus on maintaining a sense of perspective for the divers. Rick and Jo had the ability to make individuals all feel like their favorites, and they‚Äôve emphasized the importance of staying in contact over the years. Diving reunions are common and link many generations of diving veterans with Gilbert as a gifted coach and mentor, and with Rick and Jo together as the focal point of their diving family. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Olympic divers of the United States Category:Divers at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Category:Universiade medalists in diving Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:Medalists at the 1965 Summer Universiade ","title":"Rick Gilbert"},{"id":"35864862","text":"Benkovic is the surname of: *Federiko Benkoviƒá (1667‚Äì1753), late Baroque painter in Italy *Rok Benkoviƒç (born 1986), Slovenian ski jumper *Stephen J.

He is said to have been personal physician to Pope Innocentius X and Pope Alexander VII. Zacchias was also legal adviser to the Rota Romana, the highest Papal court of appeals, and head of the medical system in the Papal States. His most well known book in three volumes, Quaestiones medico-legales (1621-1651) established legal medicine as a topic of study.H√§ndel K (2003) 'Paolo Zacchia ‚Äì der geistige Vater der Rechts- medizin', Arch Kriminol Vol. 212, No. 3-4 (Sep-Oct 2003), pp.65‚Äì73 Zacchias work also contains superstitious views on magic, witches, and demons which were widely held at the time. At the time, both theological and medical knowledge was required to differentiate natural cases of sickness from supernatural causes which might require attention of the Catholic church. Zacchias was known for a skeptical approach that attempted to eliminate natural causes before diagnosing phenomena as witchcraft. Medical practitioners at his time were also made available to diagnose and assess between miracles and natural causes. He is known to have argued that minors make proper test subjects to be put to torture. Despite these views, Zacchias is seen to have notably progressed the works of jurisprudence in medicine of the time period. == Biography == Paul Zacchias was born in Rome in 1584 and died in the city in 1659. Zacchias in his life was director of the health system of the Papal States, as well as legal adviser to the Rota Romana, the highest Papal court of appeals. Under Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire in 1532, legal medicine was introduced to the court system via penal code. However, Zacchias work helped to add scientific basis to the legal practice and court system. ==Quaestiones medico-legales== Quaestiones medico- legales, tome I, 1701 edition Quaestiones medico-legales is divided into three sections. The first section contains decisions of the Rota Romana during his time serving on it. The other two sections cover questions of human physiology. In it he examines problems such as the formation of hermaphrodites, and the animation of the foetus and superfoetation. The later two volumes also include many observations by Zacchias on mental disease. Zacchias was also familiar with hypochondriacal disorder or those without genuine illness. Quaestiones medico-legales was translated into several other languages from Latin, and was used by medical practitioners into the 18th century. === Editions === * * * ==References== Category:Medical jurisprudence Category:17th-century Italian physicians Category:1584 births Category:1659 deaths ","title":"Paul Zacchias"},{"id":"35864892","text":"Kendra on Top is an American reality television series on WE tv that debuted June 5, 2012.

The name can also be written Geoduck and is not named for a bird, but a large clam. Though it is broadly similar to the Widgeon and follows its cantilever high-wing monoplane, twin engined, cruciform tail and tailwheel undercarriage layout, it has more powerful engines, retractable floats, more cabin windows and larger dimensions.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 110. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The Gweduck's structure is formed from glass and carbon fibre. Its high wings are trapezoidal in plan, fitted with externally balanced ailerons and Fowler flaps. Each wing has a float mounted below it on a single, wide chord strut which rotates through 90¬∞ after take-off to place the float at the wing tip. A pair of 300 hp (224 kW) Lycoming IO-540 six cylinder horizontally opposed engines are mounted forward of the wing leading edge with their thrust lines above the upper surface. The Gweduck has a single step hull, with the pilots' cabin just forward of the wing leading edge; behind them, the passenger cabin has four windows on each side. Tail surfaces are straight edged, the tailplane trapezoidal and the fin leading edge swept, with a horn balanced rudder and externally mass balanced elevators. On land the Gweduck uses a conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels that retract but remain exposed in the fuselage sides and a tailwheel that retracts behind doors in the extreme rear fuselage. The first flight was on 2 May 2009 from Lake Washington. By June 2010, 200 flying hours had been logged. ==Operational history== By April 2017, one example, the prototype, had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration. ==SpecificationsReferences * Category:Amphibious aircraft Category:Flying boats Gweduck Category:High-wing aircraft Category:2000s United States civil utility aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 2009 Category:Twin piston-engined tractor aircraft ","title":"Ellison-Mahon Gweduck"},{"id":"35864961","text":"Richard Pribram (1847-1928) Richard Pribram (21 April 1847, Prague ‚Äì 7 January 1928, Berlin) was an Austrian chemist.

This effort was part of a major propaganda initiative performed by the socialist government of Salvador Allende, in power between the end of 1970 and September 1973 .After the conference, the building was used as a cultural center until the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. After the end of the Pinochet regime, it hosted a number of conventions and the adjacent tower became the main building for the Ministry of National Defense. In early 2006, a fire destroyed parts of the building, which led the government of Michelle Bachelet to rethink the original sense of the building and return it into a cultural center, open to the public. Adapting the structure of its urban environment, the building takes on the concept of transparency and many artworks from the original design. The second phase that contains an auditorium with space for more than 2000 is going to start soon. The Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral was inaugurated in September 2010 and is named after Chilean poet-diplomat, educator and humanist Gabriela Mistral. Today it's a cultural centre devoted to disseminate and promote performing arts and music. Among many other activities, it offers contemporary drama and dance, as well as classic and popular music, a space to continuous development and experimentation. Furthermore, with an emphasis on contemporary photography and popular arts, the GAM houses a range for visual arts. Due to its high demands for transparency, variety and quality, it is orientated to generate direct encounters between artists and diverse audiences. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Santiago Category:Cultural centers Category:Tourist attractions in Santiago, Chile ","title":"Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral"},{"id":"35864975","text":"Original post office and general store in Seabrook, South Carolina Seabrook is an unincorporated community located in Beaufort County, South Carolina, United States. Situated in northern part of the county along the Whale Branch River, Seabrook was founded in the late 18th century as a collection of plantations became established in the area. In the late 19th century, Seabrook became a stop on the Port Royal and Augusta Railway and featured a small, but bustling downtown area that had a federal Post Office, a general store, a gas station, and a train station. The local economy was driven by the nearby farmland. The village's old economy and markets have since yielded to development in Beaufort, though the Post Office remains to serve the village's remaining inhabitants. In the past ten years, three new public schools have opened in the Seabrook area to serve area students, including Whale Branch Early College High School. The McLeod Farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. ==ReferencesSources == *http://www.seabrookpoint.com/ *http://www.merchantcircle.com/business/US.Post.Office.843-846-2775 *http://www.beaufortsc.org/military/marine-corps-air-station-beaufort.stml *http://beauforttribune.com/archives/56671 Category:Hilton Head Island‚ÄìBeaufort micropolitan area Category:Unincorporated communities in Beaufort County, South Carolina Category:Unincorporated communities in South Carolina ","title":"Seabrook, South Carolina"},{"id":"35864994","text":"Ahmed Assiri (; born November 14, 1991), is a Saudi Arabian footballer, who plays for Al-Taawoun as defender. ==Honours== ;Al Ittihad *King Cup (1): 2013 *Crown Prince Cup (1): 2016‚Äì17 *King Cup of Champions: 2017‚Äì18 The leader of the rebellion and the Chaldean club in the Union betrayal of the Union fans to rebel against the neighbor more player wasted points on his team years and years and the Union lose because of ==References== Category:Saudi Arabian footballers Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Ittihad FC players Category:Al-Taawoun FC players Category:Saudi Arabia international footballers Category:Sportspeople from Jeddah Category:Saudi Professional League players Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Ahmed Assiri (footballer, born 1991)"},{"id":"35864998","text":"Tyson Larson (born April 16, 1986) is a politician from the U.S. state of Nebraska.

Von der Ahe's family moved from Denmark to the United States in 1889, and they eventually settled in Illinois. Even though Charles was born in Denmark, the Von der Ahe family was of German extraction, having moved to Denmark one or two generations earlier. Von der Ahe was married to Linda Augusta Luer (1887 ‚Äì 1973, n√©e Linda Luer) in 1907. The Von der Ahes had eight children, with five boys and three girls: Theodore (Ted), Wilfred (Wil), Karl, Walter, Virginia, Clyde, Muriel, and Dorothy. Von der Ahe was active in civic and charitable causes, and was a principal donor for the construction of the Charles Von der Ahe Library at Loyola Marymount University, which opened in 1959. The library served as the main LMU library until the Fall of 2009 when the new William H. Hannon Library was opened. The new library contains a Von der Ahe suite located on the third floor. == Vons ‚Äì early history == Von der Ahe began his career as a delivery boy for a meat shop and grocery store in Illinois. Then, he went west to seek his fortune. He arrived in Los Angeles, and in 1906 with a $1200 investment, he opened Von's Groceteria, a 20-foot store at the corner of 7th and Figueroa streets. Von der Ahe pioneered a system of cash and carry (as opposed to charge and deliver). He also pioneered the combination store concept: his concept of leasing storefronts to produce vendors and butchers, an innovation which lead to the development of the first supermarket in California. His business grew quickly, and he had expanded to 87 stores by 1928. He sold the business to MacMarr Stores in 1929, in anticipation of the stock market crash, and retired from the business. A few years later, Von der Ahe's sons Wilfred and Theodore convinced him to provide financial backing, and the Von der Ahes opened the Vons Grocery Company in 1932. In 1948, Vons opened a pioneering store which offered self-service, pre-packaged produce, meat, and deli items, which has been called by some the first supermarket and established Vons and the Von der Ahes as leaders in the industry. Many features of supermarkets today, such as volume buying, large stores, open refrigerated cases, centralized meat-cutting, and the cent-off food coupon stem from the early days of competition between Vons and Ralphs. By 1958, Vons was the third- largest grocery chain in greater Los Angeles. When the company went public, Vons had annual sales of $100 million and 28 stores. In 1960 it acquired the sixth-largest competitor Shopping Bag Food Stores, a merger that was challenged by the Federal Trade Commission on antitrust grounds. In 1966 the United States Supreme Court ruled against Vons in United States v. Von's Grocery Co. (384 U.S. 270), forcing a re-divestiture of the stores. The Von der Ahe family sold the chain to Household Finance Corporation in 1969. In 1970, Vons had 128 stores, making it the 2nd largest supermarket chain in southern California behind Safeway. By the end of 2011, Vons had 325 stores across Southern California and Nevada. Von der Ahe was President and Chairman of Vons. == See also == * List of grocers ==References *History of Vons * Category:American businesspeople in retailing Category:American grocers Category:Danish emigrants to the United States Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles Category:1882 births Category:1973 deaths ","title":"Charles Von der Ahe"},{"id":"35865005","text":"Pejibaye District * Pejibaye District, Jim√©nez, Costa Rica * Pejibaye District, P√©rez Zeled√≥n, Costa Rica Category:District name disambiguation pages ","title":"Pejibaye District"},{"id":"35865026","text":"Shambhunath Tundiya Shambhuprasad Tundiya is member of Bharatiya Janata Party and member of Rajya Sabha from Gujarat state for the term 2014‚Äì2020., He is Very Well Known Mahant of Savgun Samadhisthan, Zanjarka and he is also \\"SHEPHERD\\" of Dalit Community. in September 2017 Bhartiya Janata Party Gujrat Declare him a State President of BJP SC Morcha During 2007‚Äì2012, he is a Member of Legislative assembly from Dasada constituency in Gujarat for its 12th legislative assembly == Early life == Shri Shambhuprasad Tundiya was born in a small village named \\"Zanjarka\\" in Dhandhuka taluka of Ahmedabad district in Gujarat State.

She was a favourite of the emperor Nero, serving as \\"mistress of the Imperial wardrobe\\" at the palace. A noblewoman of unknown lineage, she was considered to have great power and influence, having accompanied Nero and his third wife Statilia Messalina to Greece in 66. She was seen as greedy and rapacious by her contemporaries. Tacitus called Calvia Crispinilla a \\"tutor in vice\\" (magistrate libidinum) of Nero.Champlin, 2005, p.146 When Nero married the young castrated boy Sporus in 67, he made her the \\"mistress of wardrobe\\" of Sporus (epitropeia ten peri estheta). By 68‚Äì69, after changing her political associations, Crispinilla was said to be the instigator of the unsuccessful revolt of Lucius Clodius Macer in Africa. She was subsequently credited with being behind the defection of Galba from Nero. After Nero's death, Calvia Crispinilla was married to Sextus Traulus Montanus, a wealthy senator. During Otho's brief period as emperor there was a public outcry for her execution but Otho seems to have protected her, and she survived unscathed. Calvia Crispinilla was also active within commerce, and enjoyed success with her investments in the lucrative wine trade. PURCELL N.

In 1957, signposted road numbering was introduced in the Netherlands and the governments Rijkswegen plan foresaw in an increasing number of highways, together forming a nationwide system. Alongside the pan- European E-road numbers, which were given to routes of international importance, a complementing series of N-road numbers was devised to designate those routes not included in the European system, but considered of national significance.Elsevier Atlas van Nederland, Belgi√´ en Luxemburg, samengesteld door de Winkler Prins redactie, Amsterdam/Brussel 1960. In 1976, the until then administrative only Rijksweg numbers were adopted as the new road denominations, along with a completely new series of N-numbers for Non motorway highways, in 1978. The original brown N-numbers on road-signs were since then replaced with red A-numbers, for Dutch motorways, and new yellow N-numbers for other highways. The E-road system was significantly renumbered in 1985, but remains signposted everywhere in the Netherlands.De Grote Shell Atlas: Benelux en Europa. Editie 1979.

Aspen was seeking office for the first time; she had been active in, and her husband Jeremy Aspen had been co- chair of, the Mayor Suttle Recall Committee, which in 2010‚Äì11 had made an unsuccessful attempt to recall mayor Jim Suttle. In April, an Aspen mailing accused Harr of ignoring problems with Nebraska's \\"good time\\" law, which allowed convicts to win early release from prison; in 2013, one such convict, Nikko Jenkins, had committed four murders in Omaha. In the May primary, Aspen obtained 2183 votes to Harr's 2076. Both candidates moved on to the general election, in which a proposal to raise Nebraska's minimum wage was also on the ballot.

Costa Ricans are predominantly castizos (halfway between white and mestizo), whites and mestizo, but their country is considered a multiethnic society, which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic backgrounds. As a result, modern-day Costa Ricans do not consider their nationality as an ethnicity but as a citizenship with various ethnicities. Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattoes, Blacks, Asians, and Amerindians. In addition to the \\"Indigenas\\", whites, mestizos, blacks and mulattoes, Costa Rica is also home to thousands of Asians. Most of the Chinese and Indians now living in the country are descendants of those that arrived during the 19th century as migrant workers. By 2018, Costa Rica has a population of 5,000,000 people. The population growth rate between 2005 and 2010 was estimated to be 1.5% annually, with a birth rate of 17.8 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 4.1 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. By 2016, the population had increased to about 4.9 million. Costa Rica was the point where the Mesoamerican and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of Nahuatl cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors (conquistadores) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had Chibcha influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with Jamaican immigrant workers during the 19th century. The country has received immigration from Europe, Africa, Asia, Americas, Middle East etc. The immigration received from Nicaragua and the rest of Central America during this century can be perceived nowadays in every corner of the country. ==History== Costa Rica was one of the relatively more isolated populations of the New Spain viceroyalty Average Costa Rican Family - Early Twentieth Century. The colonial period began when Christopher Columbus reached the eastern coast of Costa Rica on his fourth voyage in 1502. Numerous subsequent Spanish expeditions followed, eventually leading to the first Spanish colony, Villa Bruselas in Costa Rica in 1524. During most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which was nominally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (i.e., Mexico), but which in practice operated as a largely autonomous entity within the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition under Spanish law to trade with its southern neighbors in Panama, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (i.e., Colombia), and the lack of resources such as gold and silver, made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica was described as \\"the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America\\" by a Spanish governor in 1719. Another important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for forced labor, which meant that most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large haciendas. For all these reasons Costa Rica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the Spanish Crown and left to develop on its own. The small landowners' relative poverty, the lack of a large indigenous labor force, the population's ethnic and linguistic homogeneity, and Costa Rica's isolation from the Spanish colonial centers in Mexico and the Andes all contributed to the development of an autonomous and individualistic agrarian society. Even the Governor had to farm his own crops and tend to his own garden due to the poverty that he lived in. An egalitarian tradition also arose. Costa Rica became a \\"rural democracy\\" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowlands. ==Ethnic groups== left Chavela Vargas Mixed-Costa Rican Born - Singer left Joel Campbell Afro-Costa Rican Football Player left Keylor Navas Native America-Costa Rican - Real Madrid Goalkeeper most Costa Ricans are primarily of Spanish or Mixed Native/Spanish/African ancestry with minorities of Italian, Portuguese, German, French, British, Irish, Jamaican, Greek, mixed or other Latin American ancestries. European migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to reach the USA West Coast (California) in the late 19th century and until the 1910s (before the Panama Canal opened). Other ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Nicaraguan, Venezuelans, Peruvian, Brazilians, Portuguese, Palestinians, Caribbeans, Turks, Armenians and Georgians. Many of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to Christianity who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition. According to DNA tests from Ancestry.com and 23&me; most of the original Costa Rican population from the Central Valley have around 1-3% Sephardi Jewish DNA. The first sizable group of self- identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous. Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattos, Blacks, Amerindians and Asians. About 8% of the population is of Black African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans, English-speaking descendants of 19th century black Jamaican immigrant workers. In 1873 the Atlantic Railroad imported 653 Chinese indentured laborers, hoping to duplicate the success of rail projects that used Chinese labor in Peru, Cuba, and the United States. Asians represent less than 0.5% of the Costa Rican population, mostly from China, Taiwan and Japan. There are also over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirris√≠ (in the Central Valley), Matamb√∫ or Chorotega (Guanacaste), Maleku (northern Alajuela), Bribri (southern Atlantic), Cab√©car (Cordillera de Talamanca), Guaym√≠ (southern Costa Rica, along the Panam√° border), Boruca (southern Costa Rica) and T√©rraba (southern Costa Rica). Today, according to modern DNA test's data the average Costa Rican (with 4 Costa Rican grand-parents) from the Central Valley is around 59% and 75% European, mostly Spanish, Basque or Portuguese, with around 15% - 35% Native American DNA from Central America or Colombia/Venezuela and 1-10% African particularly from Cameroon, Senegal or Congo on average. Native American from other regions in the Americas, European Jewish, Italian, Irish, Asian and Middle Eastern DNA can also be traced in part of the current Costa Rican population. Values vary drastically per region. A considerable portion of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans.www.state.gov Background Note: Costa Rica ‚Äì People There is also a number of Colombian refugees. Moreover, Costa Rica took in many refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s ‚Äì notably from El Salvador, Chile, Cuba and recently from Venezuela. Currently immigrants represent 13% of the Costa Rican population, the largest in Central America and the Caribbean. By 2019 the largest Immigrant Diasporas in Costa Rica are people from: Nicaragua, Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador and United States. ==Population== Approximately 40% live in rural areas and 60% in urban areas. The rate of urbanization estimated for the period 2005‚Äì2010 is 2.3% per annum, one of the highest among developing countries. {  - !Province !Province population !City !City population - border = \\"1\\"San Jose Province  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,345,750 align=\\"left\\"San Jose de Costa Rica  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"350,535 - border = \\"1\\"Alajuela Province  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"716,286 align=\\"left\\"Alajuela  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"46,554 - border = \\"1\\"Cartago Province  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"432,395 align=\\"left\\"Cartago  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"156,600 - border = \\"1\\"Puntarenas Province  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"357,483 align=\\"left\\"Puntarenas  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"102,504 - border = \\"1\\"Heredia Province  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"354,732 align=\\"left\\"Heredia  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"42,600 - border = \\"1\\"Limon Province  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"339,395 align=\\"left\\"Puerto Limon  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"105,000 - border = \\"1\\"Guanacaste Province  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"264,238 align=\\"left\\"Liberia  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"98,751 } ==Languages== thumbcentre300pxDistribution of voseo: The primary language spoken in Costa Rica is Costa Rican Spanish, one of the main particularities of the Costa Rica Spanish is the usage of the second person singular pronoun vos (called voseo) or usted instead of t√∫. Some native languages are still spoken in indigenous reservations. The most numerically important are the Bribri, Mal√©ku, Cab√©car and Ng√§bere languages, some of which have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica ‚Äì others a few hundred. Some languages, such as Teribe and Boruca, have fewer than a thousand speakers. A Creole-English language, Jamaican patois (also known as Mekatelyu), is spoken along the Caribbean coast. About 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks English, 0.7% French, and 0.3% speaks Portuguese or German as a second language. Mennonite immigrants to the country also speak Plautdietsch. ==Religion== Bas√≠lica de Nuestra Se√±ora de los √Ångeles (Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels), during 2007 pilgrimage Christianity is the predominant religion, and Roman Catholicism is the official state religion according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees freedom of religion. According to the most recent nationwide survey of religion, conducted in 2007 by the University of Costa Rica, 70.5% of Costa Ricans are Roman Catholics, 44.9% of the population are practicing Catholics, 13.8% are evangelical Protestants, 11.3% report they do not have a religion, and 4.3% belonged to another. Because of the recent small but continuous immigration from Asia and the Middle East, other religions have grown, the most popular being Buddhism (because of a growing Han Chinese community of 40,000), and smaller numbers of followers of the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Bah√° º√≠ Faiths. The Sinagoga Shaarei Zion synagogue Centro Israelita de Costa Rica, Comunidad Jud√≠a de Costa Rica, Costa Rican Jewish Community is near La Sabana Metropolitan Park in San Jos√©. Several homes in the neighborhood east of the park display the Star of David and other Jewish symbols.

That is, any homeomorphism (X, Y) ‚Üí (X‚Ä≤, Y‚Ä≤) induces an isomorphism œÄ1(X ‚àí Y) ‚Üí œÄ1(X‚Ä≤ ‚àí Y‚Ä≤) taking peripheral subgroups to peripheral subgroups. A peripheral subgroup consists of loops in X ‚àí Y which are peripheral to Y, that is, which stay \\"close to\\" Y (except when passing to and from the basepoint). When an ordered set of generators for a peripheral subgroup is specified, the subgroup and generators are collectively called a peripheral system for the pair (X, Y). Peripheral systems are used in knot theory as a complete algebraic invariant of knots. There is a systematic way to choose generators for a peripheral subgroup of a knot in 3-space, such that distinct knot types always have algebraically distinct peripheral systems. The generators in this situation are called a longitude and a meridian of the knot complement. == Full definition == Peripheral loops live in U ‚à™ Œ≥ Let Y be a subspace of the path- connected topological space X, whose complement X ‚àí Y is path-connected. Fix a basepoint x ‚àà X ‚àí Y. For each path component Vi of X ‚àí Y‚à©Y, choose a path Œ≥i from x to a point in Vi. An element [Œ±] ‚àà œÄ1(X ‚àí Y, x) is called peripheral with respect to this choice if it is represented by a loop in U ‚à™ ‚à™ iŒ≥i for every neighborhood U of Y. The set of all peripheral elements with respect to a given choice forms a subgroup of œÄ1(X ‚àí Y, x), called a peripheral subgroup. In the diagram, a peripheral loop would start at the basepoint x and travel down the path Œ≥ until it's inside the neighborhood U of the subspace Y. Then it would move around through U however it likes (avoiding Y). Finally it would return to the basepoint x via Œ≥. Since U can be a very tight envelope around Y, the loop has to stay close to Y. Any two peripheral subgroups of œÄ1(X ‚àí Y, x), resulting from different choices of paths Œ≥i, are conjugate in œÄ1(X ‚àí Y, x). Also, every conjugate of a peripheral subgroup is itself peripheral with respect to some choice of paths Œ≥i. Thus the peripheral subgroup's conjugacy class is an invariant of the pair (X, Y). A peripheral subgroup, together with an ordered set of generators, is called a peripheral system for the pair (X, Y). If a systematic method is specified for selecting these generators, the peripheral system is, in general, a stronger invariant than the peripheral subgroup alone. In fact, it is a complete invariant for knots. == In knot theory == Peripheral loops live in Œ≥ union the tube. The peripheral subgroups for a tame knot K in R3 are isomorphic to Z ‚äï Z if the knot is nontrivial, Z if it is the unknot. They are generated by two elements, called a longitude [l] and a meridian [m]. (If K is the unknot, then [l] is a power of [m], and a peripheral subgroup is generated by [m] alone.) A longitude is a loop that runs from the basepoint x along a path Œ≥ to a point y on the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of K, then follows along the tube, making one full lap to return to y, then returns to x via Œ≥. A meridian is a loop that runs from x to y, then circles around the tube, returns to y, then returns to x. (The property of being a longitude or meridian is well-defined because the tubular neighborhoods of a tame knot are all ambiently isotopic.) Note that every knot group has a longitude and meridian; if [l] and [m] are a longitude and meridian in a given peripheral subgroup, then so are [l]¬∑[m]n and [m]‚àí1, respectively (n ‚àà Z). In fact, these are the only longitudes and meridians in the subgroup, and any pair will generate the subgroup. A peripheral system for a knot can be selected by choosing generators [l] and [m] such that the longitude l has linking number 0 with K, and the ordered triple (m‚Ä≤,l‚Ä≤,n) is a positively oriented basis for R3, where m‚Ä≤ is the tangent vector of m based at y, l‚Ä≤ is the tangent vector of l based at y, and n is an outward-pointing normal to the tube at y. (Assume that representatives l and m are chosen to be smooth on the tube and cross only at y.) If so chosen, the peripheral system is a complete invariant for knots, as proven in [Waldhausen 1968]. A square knot (left) and a granny knot (right). === Example: Square knot versus granny knot === The square knot and the granny knot are distinct knots, and have non- homeomorphic complements. However, their knot groups are isomorphic. Nonetheless, it was shown in [Fox 1961] that no isomorphism of their knot groups carries a peripheral subgroup of one to a peripheral subgroup of the other. Thus the peripheral subgroup is sufficient to distinguish these knots. A trefoil and a mirror trefoil. === Example: Trefoil versus mirror trefoil === The trefoil and its mirror image are distinct knots, and consequently there is no orientation-preserving homeomorphism between their complements. However, there is an orientation-reversing self-homeomorphism of R3 that carries the trefoil to its mirror image. This homeomorphism induces an isomorphism of the knot groups, carrying a peripheral subgroup to a peripheral subgroup, a longitude to a longitude, and a meridian to a meridian. Thus the peripheral subgroup is not sufficient to distinguish these knots. Nonetheless, it was shown in [Dehn 1914] that no isomorphism of these knot groups preserves the peripheral system selected as described above. An isomorphism will, at best, carry one generator to a generator going the \\"wrong way\\". Thus the peripheral system can distinguish these knots. === Wirtinger presentation === It is possible to express longitudes and meridians of a knot as words in the Wirtinger presentation of the knot group, without reference to the knot itself. == References == * Fox, Ralph H., A quick trip through knot theory, in: M.K.

Lalli was named to the All-Atlantic Sun Conference's first team as a third baseman in 2005 and as a catcher in 2006. In 2005, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League.  Undrafted out of college, Lalli signed with the Chicago Cubs as a free agent in 2006. He was named a Southern League All-Star in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The Cubs promoted Lalli to MLB on May 18, 2012, and he made his MLB debut that day.

Eden and formerly Mt Eden Dubstep) are a dubstep and EDM production duo from New Zealand, composed of Jesse Cooper and Harley Rayner. Mt Eden's most well-known songs are their original \\"Sierra Leone\\" (a remix of Freshlyground's \\"I'd Like\\"), and their respective remixes of Delerium's \\"Silence\\" as well as Lisa Miskovsky's \\"Still Alive\\". Mt Eden started gaining popularity when their remix of Freshlyground's \\"I'd Like\\", titled \\"Sierra Leone\\", went viral on YouTube in 2009. They currently have 146 million combined video views and over 258 thousand subscribers on their YouTube channel, as well as more than 291.663 \\"likes\\" on their Facebook page. ==History Background and beginnings=== Jesse Cooper started making mixtapes under the moniker \\"Jay Fresh\\" on the weekends. In the beginning Cooper mostly made hip hop mixes with his friends, one of which was Harley Rayner, the son of former Split Enz keyboardist Eddie Rayner. In 2008, Cooper decided to make dubstep music after he heard Electronic musicians Benga and Skream, at the New Zealand music festivals Phat09 and Splore, saying that he had his \\"mind blown\\" by the young genre. He also started making drum and bass music around the same time, which was inspired by the Front Left Speaker Crew and Joe Hockley. One of the first songs Mt Eden made public was \\"Sierra Leone\\", a remix of Freshlyground's \\"I'd Like\\", which he uploaded and posted on his Myspace page, however the song gained major recognition after a fan posted the track on YouTube. In 2008, Cooper's girlfriend's little brother suggested he make a YouTube page for himself to post music on. He called the page \\"MtEdenDnB08\\" because he lived in Mt Eden. That was when Cooper decided to release music under the pseudonym \\"Mt Eden Dubstep\\", later changing his name to simply \\"Mt Eden\\" in 2010, when Cooper recruited Rayner. Mt Eden released their first extended play (EP) MEDS for digital download on 7 December 2010. It has got mostly positive reviews by customers on iTunes. On 16 February 2013, Mt Eden announced upcoming releases in a post on their Facebook page, writing: \\"[...] Our Sierra Leone Remix package (Sierra Leone Reinvented + Remixes, Sierra Leone music video) is coming in April. The first single off No Mans Land is \\"Airwalker\\", to be released late April/early May, with the full Walking on Air EP out in late May. No Mans Land LP will [drop] in June.\\" The EP Sierra Leone (feat. Freshlyground) [Remixes] was released on 30 April 2013, with a completely re-made version of their original \\"Sierra Leone\\" and three remixes of the same song by Ta-ku, AraabMuzik and Tommie Sunshine with Live City. The duo's Walking on Air EP was released in June 2013, featuring seven songs, by Ultra Records Label. ==References* Mt Eden on SoundCloud Category:New Zealand dub musical groups Category:New Zealand electronic music groups Category:Remixers Category:New Zealand record producers Category:New Zealand musical duos Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in New Zealand Category:Dubstep musicians Category:Electronic music duos ","title":"Mt Eden (band)"},{"id":"35865754","text":"La Sera is an American indie rock band formed by Katy Goodman, the bassist for Vivian Girls, in 2010.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music- features/vivian-girls-in-the-studio-reunion-album-memory-860720/Perpetua, Matthew. \\"Artist to Watch: La Sera's Sweet, Dreamy Pop\\", Rolling Stone They have released four albums and toured internationally. ==History== La Sera, whose name means \\"the evening\\" in Italian, started in 2010, with Goodman writing songs and Brady Hall producing.Caramanica, Jon. \\"Indie Scene‚Äôs Uncomplicated Side\\", The New York Times, New York, 18 October 2010.

For the rest of Stalin's rule, the Soviet press presented Stalin as an all-powerful, all-knowing leader, with Stalin's name and image appearing everywhere. ==Stalin's image in propaganda and the mass media== FDJ carry Stalin's pictures in the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students in East Berlin The Soviet press constantly praised Stalin, describing him as \\"Great\\", \\"Beloved\\", \\"Bold\\", \\"Wise\\", \\"Inspirer\\", and \\"Genius\\". It portrayed him as a caring yet strong father figure, with the Soviet populace as his \\"children\\".Gill, \\"The Soviet Leader Cult\\", 171. From 1936, the Soviet press started to refer to Stalin as the Father of Nations.Father of Nations at the Encyclopedic dictionary of catchy words and phrases. Interactions between Stalin and children became a key element of the personality cult. Stalin often engaged in publicized gift giving exchanges with Soviet children from a range of different ethnic backgrounds. Beginning in 1935, the phrase, \\"Thank You Dear Comrade Stalin for a Happy Childhood!\\" appeared above doorways at nurseries, orphanages, and schools; children also chanted this slogan at festivals.Catriona Kelly, \\"Riding the Magic Carpet: Children and the Leader Cult in the Stalin Era\\", The Slavic and East European Journal 49 (2005): 206‚Äì207. Speeches described Stalin as \\"Our Best Collective Farm Worker\\", \\"Our Shockworker, Our Best of Best\\", and \\"Our Darling, Our Guiding Star\\". The image of Stalin as a father was one way in which Soviet propagandists aimed to incorporate traditional religious symbols and language into the cult of personality; the title of \\"father\\" now first and foremost belonged to Stalin, as opposed to the Russian Orthodox priests. The cult of personality also adopted the Christian traditions of procession and devotion to icons through the use of Stalinist parades and effigies. By reapplying various aspects of religion to the cult of personality, the press hoped to shift devotion away from the church and towards Stalin.Victoria E. Bonnell, The Iconography of Power: Soviet Political Posters Under Lenin and Stalin (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 165. Initially, the press also aimed to demonstrate a direct link between Stalin and the common people; newspapers often published collective letters from farm or industrial workers praising the leader,Benno Ennker, \\"The Stalin Cult, Bolshevik Rule and Kremlin Interactions in the 1930s\\", in The Leader Cult in Communist Dictatorship: Stalin and the Eastern Bloc, ed. Bal√°zs Apor et al. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 85. as well as accounts and poems about meeting Stalin. Shortly after the revolution of October 1917 the Ivan Tovstukha drafted up a biographical section featuring Stalin for the Russian Granat Encyclopedia Dictionary. Even though most of the description of Stalin's career was very much embellished, it had gained so much favor with the public that they released a fourteen-page pamphlet of it alone named Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin: A Short Biography with a print run of 50,000. However, these sorts of accounts declined after World War II; Stalin drew back from public life, and the press instead began to focus on remote contact (i.e. accounts of receiving a telegram from Stalin or seeing the leader from afar).Kelly, \\"Riding the Magic Carpet\\", 208. Another prominent part of Stalin's image in the mass media was his close association with Vladimir Lenin. The Soviet press maintained that Stalin had been Lenin's constant companion while the latter was alive, and that as such, Stalin closely followed Lenin's teachings and could continue the Bolshevik legacy after Lenin's death.Gill, \\"The Soviet Leader Cult\\", 168. Stalin fiercely defended the correctness of Lenin's views in public, and in doing so Stalin implied that, as a faithful follower of Leninism, his own leadership was similarly faultless.Robert Tucker, Stalin in Power: the Revolution From Above, 1929‚Äì1941 (New York: Norton, 1990), 154. Lenin did not want Stalin to succeed him, stating that \\"Comrade Stalin is too rude\\" and suggesting that the party find someone \\"more patient, more loyal, more polite\\". Stalin did not completely succeed in suppressing Lenin's Testament suggesting that others remove Stalin from his position as leader of the Communist party. However some such as historian Stephen Kotkin have argued that these statements of Lenin were actually forgeries, they were not written or signed by Lenin but were allegedly spoken by him and taken down. According to V. Sakharov the dates on these allegedly forged portions also contradict the dates in the diaries of Lenin's secretaries and doctors. Kotkin argues that the leaders of the party, both Stalin and his opponents knew these segments were forged and for this reason they didn't have much impact and Stalin wasn't removed from his post even though he offered to step down. Stalin did not contest the validity of the forged segment but turned it into a propaganda weapon against his enemies. The allegedly forged section called him \\"too rude\\"; in answer Stalin admitted and apologized for his rudeness, but said he could not help being rude to those who harm the party. Lenin's sister Maria also defended Stalin against his opponents regarding his friendship with Lenin. Later even Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya came to Stalin's defense, despite earlier being a supporter of Zinoviev. After Lenin's death 500,000 copies of a photograph of Lenin and Stalin apparently chatting as friends on a bench appeared throughout the Soviet Union. Before 1932, most Soviet propaganda posters showed Lenin and Stalin together.Bonnell, The Iconography of Power, 158. This propaganda was embraced by Stalin, who weaponized this relationship in speeches to the proletarian, stating Lenin was \\"the great teacher of the proletarians of all nations\\" and subsequently identifying himself with the proletarians by their kinship as mutual students of Lenin. However, eventually the two figures merged in the Soviet press; Stalin became the embodiment of Lenin. Initially, the press attributed any and all success within the Soviet Union to the wise leadership of both Lenin and Stalin, but eventually Stalin alone became the professed cause of Soviet well-being.Gill, \\"The Soviet Leader Cult\\", 169. ==Other displays of devotion== Stalin became the focus of literature, poetry, music, paintings and film that exhibited fawning devotion. An example was A. V. Avidenko's \\"Hymn to Stalin\\": Stalin's monument in Prague Numerous pictures and statues of Stalin adorned public places. In 1955 a giant monument dedicated to Stalin was constructed in Prague and stood until 1962. The statue was a gift for Stalin's sixty-ninth birthday from Prague to commemorate \\"Mr. Stalin's personalty, mostly from his ideological features\\". After 5 years in the making, the massive 17,000-ton monument was finally revealed to the public which depicted Stalin, with one at the front of a group of proletarian workers. Statues of Stalin depicted him at a height and build approximating the very tall Tsar Alexander III, but photographic evidence suggests he was between 5 ft 5 in and 5 ft 6 in (165‚Äì168 cm). Stalin-themed art appeared privately, as well: starting in the early 1930s, many private homes included \\"Stalin rooms\\" dedicated to the leader and featuring his portrait.Catriona Kelly, \\"Riding the Magic Carpet\\", 202. Although it was not an official uniform, party leaders throughout the Soviet Union emulated the dictator's usual outfit of dark green jacket, riding breeches, boots, and cap to prove their devotion. The advent of the cult also led to a renaming craze: numerous towns, villages and cities were renamed after the Soviet leader. The Stalin Prize and Stalin Peace Prize were also named in his honor, and he accepted several grandiloquent titles (e.g., \\"Father of Nations\\", \\"Builder of Socialism\\", \\"Architect of Communism\\", \\"Leader of Progressive Humanity\\" and others). The cult reached new levels during World War II, with Stalin's name included in the new Soviet national anthem. Stalin at his 70th birthday ceremony with Marshal Nikolai Bulganin, Chinese Communist Leader Mao Zedong, Mongolian Communist Leader Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal and German Communist Leader Walter Ulbricht In December 1949, Stalin celebrated his purported 70th birthday (he had in fact been born in December 1878). His birthday was celebrated extensively throughout the USSR. In the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the former Sanatorium Avenue was renamed to Stalin Avenue. Various statues and institutions were made to honor him. On 2 December 1949, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a decree to form a government committee centered on Stalin's birthday. 18 days later, the Supreme Soviet awarded the Order of Lenin to Stalin. On 21 December, the day after he was awarded, a ceremonial meeting dedicated to the 70th birthday of Stalin took place in the Bolshoi Theater.–õ–µ–≤ –ö–æ—Ç—é–∫–æ–≤. –ó–∞–±—ã—Ç—ã–π –ø–æ—ç—Ç. Notable world leaders were in attendance, including Chinese leader Mao Zedong and East German Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht. Marshal of the Mongolian People's Republic Khorloogiin Choibalsan, who was once a favorite of Stalin, did not attend the ceremonies, instead sending General Secretary Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal. For Mao, the celebrations were part of his first state visit to the USSR since taking power. In many Eastern bloc countries, Stalin's birthday was also celebrated extensively. The Bulgarian city of Varna was renamed to Stalin and Musala was renamed to Stalin peak. The Gerlachovsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t in Czechoslovakia was also renamed after Stalin. == Stalin and the youth == One way Stalin's cult was spread was through the Komsomol, the All-Union Leninist Communist League of Youth in Soviet Russia, created in 1918. The ages of these youths ranged from 9 to 28 years old making it a favorable instrument to reshape the members and ideology of the Soviet Union. This organization was created to raise the next generation into the type of socialist that Stalin envisioned. Being a part of this organization was beneficial to the participants for they were favored over a non-member when it came to getting scholarships and jobs. Just like most youth clubs, they focused on their member's education and health, with sports and physical activities. They also focused on their youth's behavior and character. The children were encourage to reject anyone who didn't embody the values of a socialist. In cases of lying and cheating on the schoolyard, it resulted to \\"classroom trials\\". Stalin wanted the best to prevail in his image of the future Soviet Union so he put into effect a decree that would punish juvenile delinquency to ensure the 'good apples' were the ones paving the road for his ideal society. Organizations like the Komsomol were not the only influences on the children at the time. Cartoons like The Strangers Voice by Ivan Ivanov-Vano, reenforced the idea of a Soviet culture by depicting foreign thinking and customs as unwanted and strange. Children would play their own version of 'Cowboys and Indians' as 'Reds and Whites' with children fighting to play the main party leaders like Stalin. ==Illusion of unanimous support== The cult of personality primarily existed among the Soviet masses; there was no explicit manifestation of the cult among the members of the Politburo and other high-ranking Party officials. However, the fear of being marginalized made oppositionists sometimes hesitant to honestly express their viewpoints. This atmosphere of self-censorship created the illusion of undisputed government support for Stalin, and this perceived support further fueled the cult for the Soviet populace. The politburo and comintern secretariat (E.C.C.I.) also gave the impression of being unanimous in its decisions although this was often not the case. Many top ranking leaders in the politburo such as Zhdanov and Kaganovich sometimes disagreed with Stalin. Not all of Stalin's proposals were passed, but this was not made known to people outside the party leadership. The party leadership discussed and debated various alternatives but always presented themselves as monolithic to the outside world to appear stronger, more credible and unified. Among the leadership this was also considered correct Leninist practice, since the Leninist organizational principle of democratic centralism provided \\"freedom of debate\\" but required \\"unity of action\\" after a decision had been reached. The minority felt it their duty to submit to the will of the majority and Stalin himself practiced this when losing a vote. ==Stalin's opinion of his cult== What Stalin thought of the cult surrounding him is unclear. Like Lenin, Stalin acted modestly and unassumingly in public. John Gunther in 1940 described the politeness and good manners to visitors of \\"the most powerful single human being in the world\\". In the 1930s Stalin made several speeches that diminished the importance of individual leaders and disparaged the cult forming around him, painting such a cult as un-Bolshevik; instead, he emphasized the importance of broader social forces. Stalin's public actions seemed to support his professed disdain of the cult: Stalin often edited reports of Kremlin receptions, cutting applause and praise aimed at him and adding applause for other Soviet leaders. Sarah Davies, \\"Stalin and the Making of the Leader Cult in the 1930s\\", in The Leader Cult in Communist Dictatorship: Stalin and the Eastern Bloc, ed. Bal√°zs Apor et al. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 30‚Äì31. Walter Duranty stated that Stalin edited a phrase in a draft of an interview by him of the dictator from \\"inheritor of the mantle of Lenin\\" to \\"faithful servant of Lenin\\". Additionally, in 1936, Stalin banned renaming places after him.Davies, \\"Making of the Leader Cult\\", 41. Gunther noted, however, that Stalin \\"permitted and encouraged his own virtual deification ... Worship of him is Byzantine\\". The dictator could easily stop the adoration, but did not do so because \\"he knows the Russians understand a master. Or perhaps he likes them\\". A poster from 1934 came out featuring \\"banner of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin\\" and at the time Stalin had omitted his name from that poster. Yet by 1938 Stalin was more than comfortable with the banner featuring his name. In some memoirs even Molotov claimed that Stalin had resisted this \\"cult of personality\\" but then soon came to be comfortable with it. To some degree, Stalin accepted the Soviet people's dedication to him as an embodiment of the Party, but he discouraged all interest in his private and family life, and divulged only limited personal information. He rarely appeared in public or met with ambassadors, as of 1940 had met only seven foreign journalists for formal interviews in 20 years, and during the first five-year plan made no speeches or public appearances for 18 months. The Finnish communist Arvo Tuominen reported a sarcastic toast proposed by Stalin at a New Year Party in 1935 in which he said, \\"Comrades! I want to propose a toast to our patriarch, life and sun, liberator of nations, architect of socialism [he rattled off all the appellations applied to him in those days] ‚Äì Josef Vissarionovich Stalin, and I hope this is the first and last speech made to that genius this evening.\\"Arvo Tuominen, The Bells of the Kremlin, ed. Piltti Heiskanen, trans. Lily Leino (Hanover: University Press of New England, 1983), 162. ==Stories of the childhood of Stalin== On February 16, 1938, after the release of a book called \\"Stories of the Childhood of Stalin,\\" the publishing committee was urged to retract the book, as Stalin claimed that the book was an example of excessive hero worship that elevated his image to idealistic proportions. Stalin spoke disdainfully of this excess, expressing concern that idolatry is no substitute for rigorous Bolshevik study, and could be spun as a fault of Bolshevism by right-deviations in the USSR. Specifically he wrote: > I am absolutely against the publication of \\"Stories of the childhood of > Stalin\\". The book abounds with a mass of inexactitudes of fact, of > alterations, of exaggerations and of unmerited praise. Some amateur writers, > scribblers, (perhaps honest scribblers) and some adulators have led the > author astray. It is a shame for the author, but a fact remains a fact. But > this is not the important thing. The important thing resides in the fact > that the book has a tendency to engrave on the minds of Soviet children (and > people in general) the personality cult of leaders, of infallible heroes. > This is dangerous and detrimental. The theory of \\"heroes\\" and the \\"crowd\\" is > not a Bolshevik, but a SR theory. The heroes make the people, transform them > from a crowd into people, thus say the SRs. The people make the heroes, thus > reply the Bolsheviks to the SRs. The book carries water to the windmill of > the SRs. No matter which book it is that brings the water to the windmill of > the SRs, this book is going to drown in our common, Bolshevik cause. I > suggest we burn this book.Voprosy Istorii(Questions of History)No. 11, 1953 A more accurate depiction of his childhood and achievements are found in many other areas of writing and genre. ==End of the cult and de-Stalinization== O kulcie jednostki i jego nastƒôpstwach, Warsaw, March 1956, first edition of the Secret Speech, published for the inner use in the PUWP De-Stalinization was the process of political reform that took place after Stalin's death, where a majority of Joseph Stalin's actions during his reign were condemned and the government reformed. February 1956 was the beginning of the destruction of his image, leadership, and socialist legality under the thumb of Nikita Krushchev at the 20th Party Congress. The end of Stalin's leadership was met with positive and negative changes. Changes and consequences revolved around politics, the arts and literature, the economic realm, to the social structure. His death and the destabilization of his iconic leadership was met with the chance of new reforms and changes to his regime that had originally been immediately locked down under his ominous control. The tight lock he kept on what was published, what was propagated, and what changes to the government and economics, became accessible. With the control that Stalin held being passed on to the government, an endorsed methodology was ideally enacted. There after, a collective leadership system was the result. The result left Nikita Khrushchev, Lavrentiy Beria, Nikolai Bulganin, Georgy Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Lazar Kaganovich as members of that committee. The state of de-Stalinization was soon after put into action by Krushchev as he took on an opposite personality into the government. This allowed for better relations with the West in the future. After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 \\"Secret Speech\\" to the Twentieth Party Congress famously denounced Stalin's cult of personality, saying, \\"It is impermissible and foreign to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to elevate one person, to transform him into a superman possessing supernatural characteristics akin to those of a god.\\"Lilya Kaganovsky, How the Soviet Man Was Unmade (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2008), 146. The \\"Secret Speech\\" initiated a political reform known as \\"the overcoming/exposure of the cult of personality\\", later called de- Stalinization, that sought to eradicate Stalin's influence on the Soviet society. This also led the people to find the liberation to revolt publicly in Poland and Hungary. These changes were inevitably met with opposition. Even after losing favor with Stalin during his leadership, Molotov still argued in favor of Stalin's regime, opposing de-Stalinization and criticizing Stalin's successors. Mao Zedong along with some other communist leaders, while initially supporting the struggle against the \\"cult of the individual\\", criticized Khrushchev as an opportunist who merely sought to attack Stalin's leadership and policies in order to implement new different policies that in the Stalin-era would have been considered anti-Marxist Revisionism. De- Stalinization was still taking place fifty years later. Noticeably however, this didn't mean it was the end in the traditional role and practice that the leadership came with, a monopolized rule. After Krushchev's attempt at condemning Stalin's cult-like legacy, another wave and form of de- Stalinization took place. This time there was neither condemnation or exoneration of his legacy. The second campaign aimed to restructure the Soviet Union entirely, engaging public constituencies to diminish communism and bringing an end to the U.S.S.R. It condemned not only Stalin and his cult but also the other followers in power and in the end attempted to adopt a Western democratic institute in place of the traditional totalitarian system. Nevertheless, the attempt didn't take hold as planned under Putin and the centralized monogamous rule returned. This failed attempt saw the return of the cult through solely the focus on the height of Stalin's leadership, the defeat of Germany's Nazis. During this period, Russia had lost its role as a global super power. Bringing the famed legacy of Stalin back into the country laid a foundation for the rebirth of the symbolic role Stalin held at the height of his legacy. The Third Wave, as it was called, aimed to program a reassessment of Stalinism and commemorate the victims of his totalitarian regime, drawing focus, primarily, away from the political and social connections as a whole. In classrooms across the country, students were now being taught out of a modern textbook written by Alexander Filippov, which embodies Stalin as simply an efficient leader who had the unfortunate responsibility to resort to extreme measures to ensure and return Russia to its leadership role on the global scale. A sense of rehabilitation for Stalin's legacy has taken place and new governing practices which allow more freedom in beliefs, both cultural and political had taken root. Through this new practice, there is a freer nature that the citizens are both allowed to profess a condemning attitude towards Stalin's leadership as well as professing a stance that is pro-Stalin. Notably, about a third of the population in Russia still view Stalin as the admirable leader, while the rest condemn his actions. ==See also== *Mao Zedong's cult of personality *North Korean cult of personality *Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's cult of personality *Xi Jinping's cult of personality ==References== Cult of personality Category:Cults of personality Category:Stalinism ","title":"Stalin's cult of personality"},{"id":"35866045","text":"Ian McColl CBE (22 February 1915 ‚Äì 21 June 2005), was a Scottish journalist, editor and Liberal Party politician. ==Background== He was the eldest son of John McColl and Sarah Isabella (aka Morag) McPherson, of Glasgow and Bunessan, Isle of Mull.

Edgecumbe Medical Center ER As a non-profit tribal health consortium of 18 Native communities, SEARHC serves the health interests of the Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian people, other Alaska Native people, and other residents of Southeast Alaska. It is one of the oldest and largest Native-run health organizations in the United States. Each of the eighteen-member Board of Directors is elected by and represents one of the village tribal organizations. The board supervises the Chief Executive Officer of the Consortium. The Board typically alternates bi-monthly meetings between Juneau and Sitka, but will occasionally convene in a smaller village. SEARHC is funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, various grant sources, and through 3rd party billing. Services are available to eligible Alaska Native and American Indians; eligibility is typically based upon Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood or other legal documentation. Services financed by the entities, such as Health Resources and Services Administration or United States Department of Veterans Affairs, may provided for all residents of the region. As of 2012 SEARHC employs approximately 1000 employees throughout Southeast Alaska, and maintains 18 staffed facilities which includes the Joint Commission-accredited Mt. Edgecumbe Medical Center in Sitka, Alaska SEARHC also is a co-signer and member of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium which provides statewide interconnections between the regional health organizations, for example the Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network. ==History== About a decade after the Alaska Statehood Act in 1959 there were two significant Federal acts that impacted Alaska Natives. The first was the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of December 1971, which set up 13 regional for-profit Alaska Native Regional Corporations for Alaska Natives - 12 in the state and one based in the Lower 48 for Alaska Natives living in the continental United States. The next was the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. This allowed Tribal organizations to form contracts with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and to transfer the responsibility for management and delivery of services such as housing, lands management, tribal government assistance, education and employment and natural resources programs. Also included in this was the delivery of health care services, previously supplied from the Indian Health Service (IHS). SEARHC's contracting with IHS began in 1976 when it took over management of the Community Health Aides Program. In 1982, SEARHC took over operation of the IHS Juneau clinic and in 1986 it took over operation of Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital in Sitka. Following the creation of these anchor facilities, SEARHC began building and staffing regional outpatient facilities in most of the smaller villages it represented. In 2004, SEARHC developed the Frontier Extended Stay Clinic (FESC) program that allows five primary care clinics in remote Alaska and Washington to provide around-the-clock care for seriously injured or ill patients, and patients who require monitoring before returning home. By covering longer patient stays, the program has saved $14 million in medical evacuations and improved the quality of care for patients. In 2006 a biography of the organization was written and entitled Gumboot Determination: The Story of the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, which won an recognition in the American Book Awards. ==Member communities== *Angoon, Alaska - Angoon Community Association *Craig, Alaska - Craig Community Association *Douglas, Alaska - Douglas Indian Association *Haines, Alaska - Chilkoot Indian Association *Hoonah, Alaska - Hoonah Indian Association *Hydaburg, Alaska - Hydaburg Cooperative Association *Juneau, Alaska - T&H; Indians of the City & Borough of Juneau *Kake, Alaska - Organized Village of Kake *Kasaan, Alaska - Organized Village of Kasaan *Klawock, Alaska - Klawock Cooperative Association *Klukwan, Alaska - Chilkat Indian Village *Pelican, Alaska - Pelican T&H; Community Council *Petersburg, Alaska - Petersburg Indian Association *Sitka, Alaska - Sitka Tribe of Alaska *Skagway, Alaska - Skagway Traditional Council *Tenakee, Alaska - Tenakee Springs Indian Community *Wrangell, Alaska - Wrangell Cooperative Association *Yakutat, Alaska - Yakutat Tling√≠t Tribe ==References External links == * SEARHC website Category:Alaska Native organizations Category:Healthcare in Alaska Category:Non-profit organizations based in Alaska Category:Sitka, Alaska Category:Juneau, Alaska ","title":"Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium"},{"id":"35866059","text":"Bulgarian Sign Language (in Bulgarian: \\"–±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –∂–µ—Å—Ç–æ–º–∏–º–∏—á–µ–Ω –µ–∑–∏–∫ (–ë–ñ–ï)\\") is the language, or perhaps languages, of the deaf community in Bulgaria.

The property covers 118 acres (ca. 48 hectares) beginning about half a mile north of the Merritt Parkway. It was originally a private estate. Located in the woods of North Stamford, Connecticut, the 118-acre museum property is home to a 10-acre working farm, a Tudor-style museum and gallery which hosts exhibitions, an interactive nature center, 80 acres of outdoor trails, a large planetarium, a 4-story observatory with a research telescope, an otter pond, and a large playground designed for children to experience animals' perspective on nature. In addition to the facilities, the SM&NC; offers seasonal family-oriented exhibits and weekend festivals, year-round childhood educational programming, camps, and volunteer opportunities. ==History== Dr. G.R.R. Hertzberg In 1936, the museum's founders envisioned a safe and stimulating sanctuary where children and families could learn about the natural world, the agricultural sciences, astronomy, art, and history. Dr. G.R.R Hertzberg brought this philosophy to the first organizational meeting of the museum on January 20, 1936. The Stamford Museum was founded five months later, as a ‚Äúcabinet of curiosities‚Äù model occupying three rooms at the Stamford Trust Company building at 300 Main Street. The original collection grew from community donations of birds, moths, butterflies, and other geological specimens. Opened to the public on June 27, 1936, this early incarnation of the museum drew families from the area, still its prime demographic today. In 1938, the Hall of Mammals and the Hall of Geology & Mineralogy opened. In 1939, the museum was incorporated under a state charter which enabled it to receive public funds while still remaining autonomous. The Town and City of Stamford (there were two governments at that time) began contributing, and as the museum grew, so did the city and town's contributions. The same year, the Hoyt Marine Hall opened. By 1945, the museum was quickly outgrowing its small downtown location. The E.Y. Webster Estate deeded eight acres to the city of Stamford, creating the museum's second location at Courtland Park. The former carriage house became the museum's new home, and a small barnyard and wildlife area were constructed. Local artists were showcased in the small gallery, and a planetarium and weather station were constructed and installed. Opening to the public in 1946, the Courtland Park location was short-lived, as the Connecticut Turnpike claimed six of the eight acres in Courtland Park in 1955. Once again, the burgeoning museum sought another, larger location. the early Museum In 1955, the museum made its final move to the former Henri Bendel estate, where it continues to attract over 160,000 visitors each year. Henri Willis Bendel was a department-store pioneer and philanthropist who, with architect Perry Barker, built his dream castle in North Stamford in the late 1920s. After his death in 1936, the property passed through various hands for twenty years. In 1955 the estate was bequeathed to the Stamford Museum. The large, asymmetrical, 10,000 square-foot, neo-Tudor mansion Bendel used as a summer home anchored the large estate and provided ample space for the museum's early collections. ‚ÄúNature Center‚Äù was added to the name of the non- profit as the Heckshire Farm for Children opened the same year. Since then, the museum has grown considerably both in size and features. An additional sixteen acres of the bird sanctuary owned by the City of Stamford was made accessible. Another property of eight acres was donated by board member Benjamin D. Gilbert. A right of way of three acres, making the museum accessible to the Bartlett Arboretum trails, was donated by Mr. & Mrs. Dwight Marshall. In 1980, eleven acres abutting these properties was purchased by the City of Stamford, with the museum having permanent property rights, bringing its total property to 118 acres. ==FacilitiesBendel Mansion=== The Henri Bendel Mansion Built in the late 1920s by architect Perry Barker, the Bendel Mansion was Henri Willis Bendel‚Äôs homage to the classical elegance of a British manor house. Using two Tudor mansions located in Maidenhead, England as inspiration, Barker built the epitome of the American \\"castle\\" of the time for his client. The house is on a hill overlooking the lake and has lead- framed glass windows, half-timbered walls, gargoyles, arching staircases, slate roofs, and multiple chimneys. Today, the Bendel Mansion functions as a gallery and museum space and is open to the public. Museum Displays Art education at SM&NC; stretches back to its days at Courtland Park where local artists were exhibited. Art classes for all ages were introduced. The move to the Bendel Estate attracted more donors who helped build the museum's current collection, starting with the 1956 gift of a John Singer Sargent portrait and the 1961 donation of the Schulman twentieth-century American art collection. In June 1973, an enlarged and modernized art gallery opened in the main building, allowing for the growth of permanent collections as well as exhibitions featuring selections from collections, as well as works from local art organizations. Today, the museum focuses on five main areas: the natural history of New England, American art, Native American art and culture, American history and culture, and farming implements. Notable items in the SM&NC; permanent collections include totem poles from a World's fair, telescopes, outdoor sculptures, farm tools, Native American artifacts, Andy Warhol and Salvador Dal√≠ prints, vintage local pedal cars, antique Yale & Towne keys and locks, and works by Stamford artists Gutzon Borglum and Reuben Nakian. ===Hecksher Farm=== Hecksher Farm The Hecksher Farm is a working farm which references New England's rural heritage through recreational and educational activities. Its pastoral backdrop is dotted with barns, a maple sugar house, organic vegetable garden, open pastures, and dozens of farm animals. Since its first grant in 1955 from the Heckscher Foundation for Children Grant, the farm has grown from a small dairy farm to include a chicken coop, pig pen, larger pastures, shelters, and many heritage breeds of farm animals including non-indigenous llamas, alpacas, and burros. Visitors are encouraged to experience rural life by observing the wildlife and staff who carry out daily chores to keep the farm running smoothly. Farm History Farm and wildlife were introduced to SM&NC; while still at its Courtland Park location. A small farmyard containing a miniature barn was home to a lamb, a young goat, bantams, a hen and rooster, and numerous rabbits. Many orphaned or injured animals were brought to the museum where they were cared for by Junior Curators, a group of students who were studying in the nature and wildlife conservation classes. Before long, they developed a small wildlife area including an American bald eagle, a golden eagle, a fox, opossum, skunks, squirrels, and woodchucks. The Junior Curators program still exists at the SM&NC.; the Museum at Courtland Park The move to the Museum's Scofieldtown Road location in 1955 brought with it the opportunity to build a larger model farmyard and barn which could accommodate more wildlife. A donation from the Hecksher Foundation for Children funded the building of the red barn and silo which became familiar to thousands of visitors. Over the next 20 years, the Hecksher Farm expanded to include wildlife exhibits including foxes, porcupines, a sheep shelter, chicken coop, raccoons, woodchucks, and birds of prey, as well as a medical facility to ensure proper care of the animals. In the spring of 1977, the Board of Directors introduced a new initiative to create a period farm typical of those in Southern New England during the 19th century. The City of Stamford was quickly turning from a quiet suburban community into a corporate center. Small farms in the area were rapidly disappearing as industry and housing gobbled up the land. Over the next 5 years, projects developed at a rapid pace. Land was cleared to create pastures, colonial fencing was installed, and a magnificent historic Cheshire barn, circa 1750, was moved from Cheshire, Connecticut and reassembled at the farm on a hand-laid stone foundation. The farm became home to animals typical of the era and area: oxen, sheep, cows, pigs, goats, and chickens now roam the farm. At the Hecksher Farm, visitors can encounter farm life first-hand. As the farm has grown, annual programs were created such as Sheep-to-Shawl Day, Maple Sugaring, Ice Harvesting, Spring on the Farm, and Harvest Day. ===Overbrook Nature Center and Trails=== The Overbrook Nature Center is the focal point of the SM&NC;'s nature and educational programs. It contains an interactive exhibit area with small local animals and ‚ÄúNature‚Äôs Classroom,‚Äù a classroom for young student groups. Behind the Overbrook building are miles of walking trails. Winding through 80 acres of the museum's property, the trails are diverse and abundant with wildlife. Teeming vernal pools, glacial erratic boulders, mature forests, and maintained woodland meadows are found throughout the area. The trails connect with the 88-acre Bartlett Arboretum on the north end of the museum's property. Otters Edie and Bert In 2006, the universally-accessible Wheels in the Woods Trail #7 was added along Poorhouse Brook, allowing handicap access to the SM&NC; trails. ===Edith and Robert Graham Otter Pond=== The Edith and Robert Graham Otter Pond is the home of the SM&NC;'s resident river otters http://www.stamfordmuseum.org/otter-pond.html ===Observatory and Planetarium=== SM&NC;'s Observatory The Stamford Museum & Nature Center has a four-story observatory which houses a 22-inch (560 mm) reflecting telescope and is used for research (primarily of binary star systems) by the Fairfield County Astronomical Society (FCAS). The Museum's astronomical history began in 1941 when the Fairfield County Astronomical Society was formed. Members would bring their telescopes and set them up on the steps of the old Town Hall. In Courtland Park, a planetarium was constructed in one end of the lecture hall by building a dome which could be raised and lowered for planetarium shows. This was one of the first Armand Spitz planetariums. Concerned that the only planetariums then available were so expensive that few institutions could have them and few people would live near enough to visit, in 1947 Spitz completed design work on a very inexpensive planetarium model. The main problem, he discovered, was that creating a globe for stellar projection was very complex and expensive. Following a suggestion by Albert Einstein, Spitz used a dodecahedron as the \\"globe\\" equivalent for his star projector. Following a demonstration at an astronomical conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Spitz received considerable publicity, and began marketing his Model A planetarium for $500. These were sold to the various American military academies, small museums, schools, and even to King Farouk of Egypt. Within a few years, Spitz introduced the model A-1, which incorporated the Sun, Moon, and five naked eye planets, still using the dodecahedron shape for the star projector. Later a model A-2 came out, projecting more stars (the model A only gave stars brighter than magnitude 4.3). At present no record has been found establishing which model SM&NC; purchased. After moving to Scofieldtown Road, an open courtyard of the main building was enclosed to build the new planetarium. With a keen interest in astronomy for a facility well-suited to study the sky, Mr. & Mrs. Frank Altschul contributed the funds to construct an observatory on the property, which was completed in 1960. Materials were donated by local corporations, and the telescope was built by volunteers and the Fairfield County Astronomical Society. The largest telescope in the East available for public viewing was dedicated on June 13, 1965. ===Animal Embassy=== In 2007, the SM&NC; entered into partnership with Animal Embassy. Founded by local naturalist Chris Evers, Animal Embassy has been providing children and adults the opportunity to interact with creatures and their natural habitats for many years. The Animal Embassy Building, onsite and open to the public at SM&NC;, provides dedicated space for housing, feeding, and caring for Animal Embassy's collection of non-releasable exotic animal ambassadors. In 2014, the partnership with Animal Embassy ended due to the museum's program growth and need for its own exhibit space. In March 2015, the SM&NC; opened Heckscher WILD!, a live animal exhibit that features non- releasable animals from all over the world in four ecosystems‚Äîgrasslands, rainforest, mountains, and desert. ==Events and OfferingsAnnual Events=== Harvest Festival Weekend Maple Sugar Festival Weekend Each October, the Stamford Museum & Nature Center hosts its annual Harvest Festival Weekend, focused on seasonal activities including apple cider demonstrations, hayrides, apple slingshots, pumpkin carving, farm animal demonstrations, face painting, storytelling, crafts, a costume parade, and more. Maple Sugar Festival Weekend Each March, the SM&NC; revives the New England pastime of maple sugaring during the Maple Sugar Festival Weekend. At the Hecksher Farm sugarhouse, one can view tree tapping, sap collecting, and taste the sweet maple sugar that ushers in the annual agricultural awakening. Other offerings include scavenger hunts, storytellers, face painting, maple-themed crafts, pancake brunch, and a Chef's Cook-off Challenge. Annual Fundraiser Their biggest fundraiser of the year had, for many years, been the annual wine tasting and silent auction which paid tribute to Stamford Museum & Nature Center's history within its community. The June event consisted of wine tastings, samplings of food from local restaurants and caterers and a silent auction. In 2019, the SM&NC; launched \\"An Evening With,\\" a new annual fundraiser. The inaugural event was held in May 2019 and featured world- renowned chef Jacques Pepin. Spring on the Farm Festival Weekend Heckscher Farm Festival Weekend Stamford Museum & Nature Center hosts its family- oriented Heckscher Farm Festival Weekend each May. Focusing on New England's spring traditions, including sheep shearing and wool spinning, one can view the newest additions to the farm, participate in activities like storytelling, facepainting, crafts, plant and herb sales, hayrides, and viewing the open galleries. Model T‚Äôs to Mustangs Antique & Classic Car Show Each spring the Stamford Museum & Nature Center hosts its antique classic and classic car show featuring automobiles of all makes and models, US as well as imports, manufactured between 1900 and 1979. The annual event features a special ‚Äúfocus group‚Äù dedicated to a specific brand of car. The SM&NC; ended the Model T's event after the 20th iteration. ===Past Exhibitions and Events=== *1942 - wartime exhibition Camouflage in Nature and its Uses in the Military *1944 - Museum's first Gutzon Borglum exhibition, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore LEGO ¬Æ Brick exhibition *1971 - Open House Moon Rock on display *1973 - Henry Moore's Elephant Skull *1975 - Delacroix and the French Romantic Print *1976 - Mr. Audubon & Mr. Bien; Navaho Blankets; Salon des Refuses *1978 - NASA‚Äôs Space Shuttle, Vintage Toys *1980 - 25 years on High Ridge; Toy Treasures, Permanent Collection *1994 - MAD Magazine; Ken Marchione, Elgiac Paintings *1997 - Ruben Nakian, Working the Image *2001 - Springs, Sprockets & Pulleys: The Mechanical Sculptures of Steve Gerberich; 50 Years of Beetle Bailey *2002 - Ukulele Fever: The Craze that Swept the Nation *2003 - Pedal to the Metal: A History of Children's Pedal Cars *2004 - From Goodnight Moon to Art Dog: The World of Clement, Edith and Thatcher Hurd *2005 - Creative Contraptions: Rube Goldberg and Goldberg-inspired art *2006 - Consuming Desires: Modern Marketing Posters, 1880-1918; Built to Scale: Auto, Plane & Boat Model Masterpieces *2008 - Architecture of the Imagination: The Lure of the LEGO ¬Æ Brick exhibition, showcasing the sculpture of Nathan Sawaya and Bill Probert's Trainscape, constructed with team of Stamford High School students, set record-breaking gallery attendance of 69,000 visitors *2009 - Rodin: In his Own Words; Baseball‚Äôs League of Nations: A Salute to Native American Baseball Players *2010 - Gerberich‚Äôs Gadgetry; Robert Deyber, Turning a Phrase *2011 - Gather up the Fragments: The Andrew Shaker Collection; To The Moon: Snoopy Soars with NASA Art, Nature and Me Preschool ==Education== The Stamford Museum & Nature Center offers year-round classes and educational programs in art, nature, science, and agriculture, for children, families, and adults.

After Li Su was executed for committing some offence(s), Lu Kang collected Li's body, brought back to Li's home in Yingchuan Commandery () for burial, and mourned Li's death.(Ë¨ùÊâøÂæåÊº¢Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÂ∫∑Â≠óÂ≠£ÂØßÔºåÂ∞ëÊÉáÂ≠ùÊÇåÔºåÂã§ËÑ©ÊìçË°åÔºåÂ§™ÂÆàÊùéËÇÖÂØüÂ≠ùÂªâ„ÄÇËÇÖÂæåÂùê‰∫ã‰ºèÊ≥ïÔºåÂ∫∑ÊñÇÂ∞∏ÈÄÅÂñ™ÈÇÑÊΩÅÂ∑ùÔºåË°åÊúçÔºåÁ¶ÆÁµÇÔºåËàâËåÇÊâçÔºåÊ≠∑‰∏âÈÉ°Â§™ÂÆàÔºåÊâÄÂú®Á®±Ê≤ªÔºåÂæåÊãúÂª¨Ê±üÂ§™ÂÆà„ÄÇ) Annotation from Xie Cheng's Houhanshu in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Zang Min (), the Inspector of Yang Province, nominated him as a maocai (), so Lu Kang was appointed as the Prefect () of Gaocheng County (È´òÊàêÁ∏£; around present-day Yanshan County, Hebei). Gaocheng County was very remote and its security was poor. Every household in the county was armed with bows and arrows. When the previous Prefects entered office, they made the locals build and repair the city walls. After arriving in Gaocheng County, Lu Kang freed the labourers and governed the county so well that the people were very pleased with him and even criminal activity ceased in the county. The commandery office reported Lu Kang's achievements to the Han imperial court. In 178, during the reign of Emperor Ling, Lu Kang was promoted to serve as the Administrator () of Wuling Commandery (Ê≠¶ÈôµÈÉ°; around present-day Changde, Hunan). Later, he was reassigned to be the Administrator of Guiyang (Ê°ÇÈôΩ; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) and Le'an (Ê®ÇÂÆâ; around present-day Zibo, Shandong) commanderies. He governed his jurisdictions well.(Â∫∑Â∞ë‰ªïÈÉ°Ôºå‰ª•Áæ©ÁÉàÁ®±ÔºåÂà∫Âè≤ËáßÊóªËàâÁÇ∫ËåÇÊâçÔºåÈô§È´òÊàê‰ª§„ÄÇÁ∏£Âú®ÈÇäÂûÇÔºåËàäÂà∂Ôºå‰ª§Êà∂‰∏Ä‰∫∫ÂÖ∑ÂºìÂº©‰ª•ÂÇô‰∏çËôûÔºå‰∏çÂæóË°å‰æÜ„ÄÇÈï∑ÂêèÊñ∞Âà∞ÔºåËºíÁôºÊ∞ëÁπï‰øÆÂüéÈÉ≠„ÄÇÂ∫∑Ëá≥ÔºåÁöÜÁΩ∑ÈÅ£ÔºåÁôæÂßìÂ§ßÊÅ±„ÄÇ‰ª•ÊÅ©‰ø°ÁÇ∫Ê≤ªÔºåÂØáÁõú‰∫¶ÊÅØÔºåÂ∑ûÈÉ°Ë°®‰∏äÂÖ∂ÁãÄ„ÄÇÂÖâÂíåÂÖÉÂπ¥ÔºåÈÅ∑Ê≠¶ÈôµÂ§™ÂÆàÔºåËΩâÂÆàÊ°ÇÈôΩ„ÄÅÊ®ÇÂÆâ‰∫åÈÉ°ÔºåÊâÄÂú®Á®±‰πã„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 31. Around the time, Emperor Ling wanted to build bronze statues but realised that the imperial treasury was unable to support his spending, so he issued a decree to increase taxes and recruit labour from the masses. Lu Kang observed that the people were already suffering from natural disasters such as floods and droughts, so he wrote a memorial to Emperor Ling, advising him against constructing the bronze statues and urging him to relieve the people's burdens. The eunuchs (Emperor Ling's close aides) accused Lu Kang of defaming the emperor and showing disrespect in the memorial, so Lu was arrested and brought to the office of the Minister of Justice () for questioning. Liu Dai, an Imperial Clerk (), carefully examined Lu Kang's case and wrote to the imperial court to explain matters for Lu and clear his name. Lu Kang was released but was dismissed from office and sent home. However, not long later, he was recalled back to the court to serve as a Consultant ().(ÊôÇÈùàÂ∏ùÊ¨≤ÈëÑÈäÖ‰∫∫ÔºåËÄåÂúãÁî®‰∏çË∂≥Ôºå‰πÉË©îË™øÊ∞ëÁî∞ÔºåÁïùÊñÇÂçÅÈå¢„ÄÇËÄåÊØîÊ∞¥Êó±ÂÇ∑Á®ºÔºåÁôæÂßìË≤ßËã¶„ÄÇÂ∫∑‰∏äÁñèË´´Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËá£ËÅûÂÖàÁéãÊ≤ª‰∏ñÔºåË≤¥Âú®ÊÑõÊ∞ë„ÄÇÁúÅÂÇúËºïË≥¶Ôºå‰ª•ÂØßÂ§©‰∏ãÔºåÈô§ÁÖ©Â∞±Á¥ÑÔºå‰ª•Â¥áÁ∞°ÊòìÔºåÊïÖËê¨ÂßìÂæûÂåñÔºåÈùàÁâ©ÊáâÂæ∑„ÄÇÊú´‰∏ñË°∞‰∏ªÔºåÁ™ÆÂ•¢Ê•µ‰æàÔºåÈÄ†‰ΩúÁÑ°Á´ØÔºåËààÂà∂Èùû‰∏ÄÔºåÂãûÂâ≤Ëá™‰∏ãÔºå‰ª•ÂæûËãüÊ¨≤ÔºåÊïÖÈªéÊ∞ëÂêÅÂóüÔºåÈô∞ÈôΩÊÑüÂãï„ÄÇÈôõ‰∏ãËÅñÂæ∑ÊâøÂ§©ÔºåÁï∂ÈöÜÁõõÂåñÔºåËÄåÂçíË¢´Ë©îÊõ∏ÔºåÁïùÊñÇÁî∞Èå¢ÔºåÈëÑ‰ΩúÈäÖ‰∫∫Ôºå‰ºèËÆÄÊÉÜÊÇµÔºåÊÇºÂøÉÂ§±Âúñ„ÄÇÂ§´ÂçÅ‰∏ÄËÄåÁ®ÖÔºåÂë®Ë¨Ç‰πãÂæπ„ÄÇÂæπËÄÖÈÄö‰πüÔºåË®ÄÂÖ∂Ê≥ïÂ∫¶ÂèØÈÄöËê¨‰∏ñËÄåË°å‰πü„ÄÇÊïÖÈ≠ØÂÆ£Á®ÖÁïùÔºåËÄåËùùÁÅæËá™ÁîüÔºõÂìÄÂÖ¨Â¢ûË≥¶ÔºåËÄåÂ≠îÂ≠êÈùû‰πã„ÄÇË±àÊúâËÅöÂ•™Ê∞ëÁâ©Ôºå‰ª•ÁáüÁÑ°Áî®‰πãÈäÖ‰∫∫ÔºõÊçêÊç®ËÅñÊàíÔºåËá™Ëπà‰∫°Áéã‰πãÊ≥ïÂìâÔºÅÂÇ≥Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÂêõËàâÂøÖÊõ∏ÔºåÊõ∏ËÄå‰∏çÊ≥ïÔºåÂæå‰∏ñ‰ΩïËø∞ÁÑâÔºü„ÄèÈôõ‰∏ãÂÆúÁïôÁ•ûÁúÅÂØüÔºåÊîπÊïùÂæûÂñÑÔºå‰ª•Â°ûÂÖÜÊ∞ëÊÄ®ÊÅ®‰πãÊúõ„ÄÇ„ÄçÊõ∏Â•èÔºåÂÖßÂÄñÂõ†Ê≠§Ë≠ñÂ∫∑Êè¥Âºï‰∫°ÂúãÔºå‰ª•Ë≠¨ËÅñÊòéÔºåÂ§ß‰∏çÊï¨ÔºåÊ™ªËªäÂæµË©£Âª∑Â∞â„ÄÇ‰æçÂæ°Âè≤ÂäâÂ≤±ÂÖ∏ËÄÉÂÖ∂‰∫ãÔºåÂ≤±ÁÇ∫Ë°®Èô≥Ëß£ÈáãÔºåÂÖçÊ≠∏Áî∞Èáå„ÄÇÂæ©ÂæµÊãúË≠∞ÈÉé„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 31.

They attacked and conquered four counties in the region. After Lu Kang assumed office as the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery, he was tasked with suppressing Huang Rang's rebellion.

By the time Emperor Xian came to the throne in the 190s, the Han Empire was already in a state of chaos as the central government was weak and various warlords were fighting for power. Lu Kang was aware of the high risks involved in paying tribute to the emperor, because his convoy might be attacked and robbed along the way to the capital. In spite of this, he ordered his men to escort the tribute to the capital and they succeeded. Emperor Xian issued a decree to praise Lu Kang, promote him to General of Loyalty and Righteousness (), and increase his income to 2,000 dan ().(ÁçªÂ∏ùÂç≥‰ΩçÔºåÂ§©‰∏ãÂ§ß‰∫ÇÔºåÂ∫∑ËíôÈö™ÈÅ£Â≠ùÂªâË®àÂêèÂ•âË≤¢ÊúùÂª∑ÔºåË©îÊõ∏Á≠ñÂãûÔºåÂä†Âø†Áæ©Â∞áËªçÔºåÁß©‰∏≠‰∫åÂçÉÁü≥„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 31.

When he realised he was running short of supplies, he sent a messenger to Lujiang Commandery to request 30,000 hu () of grain from Lu Kang. Lu Kang saw Yuan Shu as a traitor and refused to have any contact with him. He also fortified Lujiang's defences and prepared for war. Yuan Shu was angered and he sent Sun Ce to lead an army to attack Lujiang Commandery. Sun Ce had a personal vendetta against Lu Kang because he once visited Lu, but Lu refused to meet him in person, and instead sent a Registrar () to meet him. Sun Ce's forces besieged Lujiang Commandery but Lu Kang's troops held their ground. Some of Lu Kang's subordinates and soldiers who were on leave returned to Lujiang Commandery and made their way back into the city under the cover of night to help Lu Kang defend the city. Lujiang Commandery fell to Sun Ce's forces after a siege that lasted two years. Lu Kang died of illness at the age of 70 (by East Asian age reckoning) during the siege.(ÊôÇË¢ÅË°ìÂ±ØÂÖµÂ£ΩÊò•ÔºåÈÉ®Êõ≤È£¢È§ìÔºåÈÅ£‰ΩøÊ±ÇÂßîËº∏ÂÖµÁî≤„ÄÇÂ∫∑‰ª•ÂÖ∂ÂèõÈÄÜÔºåÈñâÈñÄ‰∏çÈÄöÔºåÂÖß‰øÆÊà∞ÂÇôÔºåÂ∞á‰ª•Á¶¶‰πã„ÄÇË°ìÂ§ßÊÄíÔºåÈÅ£ÂÖ∂Â∞áÂ≠´Á≠ñÊîªÂ∫∑ÔºåÂúçÂüéÊï∏Èáç„ÄÇÂ∫∑Âõ∫ÂÆàÔºåÂêèÂ£´ÊúâÂÖàÂèó‰ºëÂÅáËÄÖÔºåÁöÜÈÅÅ‰ºèÈÇÑËµ¥ÔºåÊöÆÂ§úÁ∑£ÂüéËÄåÂÖ•„ÄÇÂèóÊïµ‰∫åÂπ¥ÔºåÂüéÈô∑„ÄÇÊúàÈ§òÔºåÁôºÁóÖÂçíÔºåÂπ¥‰∏ÉÂçÅ„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 31.(ÂæåË°ìÊ¨≤ÊîªÂæêÂ∑ûÔºåÂæûÂª¨Ê±üÂ§™ÂÆàÈô∏Â∫∑Ê±ÇÁ±≥‰∏âËê¨Êñõ„ÄÇÂ∫∑‰∏çËàáÔºåË°ìÂ§ßÊÄí„ÄÇÁ≠ñÊòîÊõæË©£Â∫∑ÔºåÂ∫∑‰∏çË¶ãÔºå‰Ωø‰∏ªÁ∞øÊé•‰πã„ÄÇÁ≠ñÂ∏∏ÈäúÊÅ®„ÄÇË°ìÈÅ£Á≠ñÊîªÂ∫∑ÔºåË¨ÇÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂâçÈåØÁî®Èô≥Á¥ÄÔºåÊØèÊÅ®Êú¨ÊÑè‰∏çÈÅÇ„ÄÇ‰ªäËã•ÂæóÂ∫∑ÔºåÂª¨Ê±üÁúüÂçøÊúâ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÁ≠ñÊîªÂ∫∑ÔºåÊãî‰πãÔºå ...)

In addition, along with phenmetrazine, it is believed to be one of the active metabolites of phendimetrazine, which itself is inactive and behaves merely as a prodrug. Relative to phenmetrazine, pseudophenmetrazine is of fairly low potency, acting as a modest releasing agent of norepinephrine (EC50 = 514 nM), while its (+)-enantiomer is a weak releaser of dopamine (EC50 = 1,457 nM) whereas its (‚àí)-enantiomer is a weak reuptake inhibitor of dopamine (Ki = 2,691 nM); together as a racemic mixture with the two enantiomers combined, pseudophenmetrazine behaves overall more as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 2,630 nM), possibly due to the (+)-enantiomer blocking the uptake of the (‚àí)-enantiomer into dopaminergic neurons and thus preventing it from inducing dopamine release. Neither enantiomer has any significant effect on serotonin reuptake or release (both Ki = >10,000 nM and EC50 = >10,000 nM, respectively). == See also == * Phenmetrazine * Phendimetrazine == References == Category:Norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents Category:Morpholines Category:Stimulants ","title":"Pseudophenmetrazine"},{"id":"35866191","text":"The Jamaican men's national under-20 ice hockey team is the national under-20 ice hockey team of Jamaica.

The original teleplay was written by Andrew Miller, but was heavily edited by Kevin Williamson. It originally aired on Thursday, September 15, 2011. == Plot== Cassie (Britt Robertson) is run off of the road by another driver on the way home which leads to a flat tire. Unknown to Cassie, her mother, Amelia Blake (Emily Holmes), is about to see the last of this world. A stranger (Gale Harold) appears outside Cassie's residence playing with matches as a fire breaks out in the kitchen inside. Cassie's mother dies in what she believes is an accident. One month later, Cassie, still dealing with her mother's death, moves to her grandmother's (Ashley Crow) house in Chance Harbor. Cassie meets new people on her first day of school: Adam Conant (Thomas Dekker) a handsome boy who seems to have this pull to Cassie, Diana Meade (Shelley Hennig) Adam's girlfriend, Faye Chamberlain (Phoebe Tonkin) a young and all around rebel, Melissa Glaser (Jessica Parker Kennedy) Faye's quiet sidekick, and Nick Armstrong (Louis Hunter) her next door neighbor. Unknown to Cassie, this group of kids makes up a coven of witches. With Cassie now in town they can all experience the full effects of their magic. Faye sets Cassie's car on fire to see if Cassie knows she's a witch. When Cassie can't escape her car, Adam saves her. The next day, Cassie tries looking for her grandmother but runs into Diana and her father, Charles, the man who is responsible for the fire that killed Cassie's mother. Diana takes Cassie to an abandoned house in the woods and explains that they, along with Adam, Faye, Melissa, and Nick, are all witches. They call this the Circle (with Diana as the de facto leader) and is only at its best if Cassie joins. Cassie doesn't believe them, saying that witches aren't real, and runs from the house. Adam follows her and they have a moment in the woods where their energy joins together causing all of the water droplets to float. Adam leans in to kiss Cassie, but she pulls away and runs off. Cassie ponders whether she will join them or not, and all while dark secrets surface such as Diana's father, Charles, is the man that was outside Amelia's house. Along with these secrets, Cassie is revealed to be more of a puppet for the adult generation of witches that were thought to have sworn off witchcraft after a bad accident long ago. ==ReceptionRatings=== In its original American broadcast, \\"Pilot\\" of the show was watched by 3.05 million. ===Reviews=== Phoebe Tonkin portrays Faye Chamberlain The \\"Pilot\\" of the show received mostly positive reviews and, as the appended reviews attest, there was a clear comparison to The Vampire Diaries show. Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the Pilot episode with 4.7/5 stating that if there was ever an ideal comparison to The Vampire Diaries, it would be The Secret Circle. \\"...it's never clear how a book will translate to the big screen. Based on the series premiere, however, I can safely say: so far, so mysteriously, enjoyably, attractively good.\\" Rowan Kaiser and Katherine Miller from The A.V. Club gave a B- grade to the episode. Katherine said that at this moment the show wasn‚Äôt exactly a revolution in suspense but is not without promise while Rowan said that the \\"Pilot\\" was slick and has found himself really wanting to know what will happen next. \\"This show could really work well, and even if not, it should still be eminently watchable.\\" Laurel Brown from Buddy TV stated that those witches arrived as a force to be reckoned with. \\"The pilot for The Secret Circle is occasionally a bit slow as it builds up the story. But that's actually OK -- the slow build gives us a chance to really get to know the central players in this melodrama. The magic, meanwhile, is thoroughly impressive (just wait until you see everything they do with rain!).\\" ==Feature music== In the \\"Pilot\\" episode we can hear the songs: *\\"Young Blood\\" by The Naked and Famous *\\"I Go Away\\" by MNDR *\\"A Heavy Abacaus\\" by The Joy Formidable *\\"We Won't Run\\" by Sarah Blasko *\\"Wrong Time, Wrong Planet\\" by Does it Offend You, Yeah? *\\"DNA\\" by The Kills ==References* Category:2011 American television episodes Secret Circle Category:The Secret Circle (TV series) episodes ","title":"Pilot (The Secret Circle)"},{"id":"35866218","text":"Anke-Eve Goldmann was a journalist for Cycle World, Das Motorrad in Germany, Moto Revue in France and other international motorcycle magazines.Cycle world, Volume 13.

It is the only art gallery and museum dedicated to cats in Mexico. ==History== The enterprise was begun by siblings Joel and Mar√≠a del Carmen Nava Polina, along with Rodrigo Moreno Gonz√°lez, who realized that there were cat museums in the United States, Canada and the Bahamas but not in Mexico. Both come from a family of cat lovers with fifteen cats between them currently. They had also built a large collection of cat-related items over the years. The gallery began in 2006 by gathering various artists and friends to donate and put works for the gallery on consignment. Since then, the gallery has had success because it caters to a niche market which had not been served previously. Sales have included those to Europe through the Internet. Since it opened, the gallery has been featured on various television shows including TV Azteca and Once TV. ==Description== Fideo, resident cat of the gallery It is located in Colonia Roma, which is known for having a large number of galleries, boutiques and specialty stores. Most of the gallery is dedicated to art and handcrafts with cat themes with the aim of supporting artists and artisans both from Mexico and abroad as well as promoting cats aesthetically. It works with over one hundred designers, artists and artisans to create its line of products. The catalog includes over 5,000 pieces which includes handcrafts, pillows, paintings, T-shirts, jewelry, cups, toys, photographs, watches and books. Prices range from twenty pesos for a lollipop and 45 pesos for earrings to over 8,000 for an oil painting. The merchandise focuses on original art and handcrafts, ensuring that customers are buying items available nowhere else and not buying knock offs or illegal copies of commercial products. Customers include cat aficionados or friends/family of such, curious people who pass by the site and tourists. Some of the creators who work with the gallery include Daniel Soler, Serioshka Hellmund, Roxana Elvridge-Thomas, Ricardo Ham, Karina Falc√≥n, Iris M√©xico, Miguel √Ångel Tenorio, Guillermo Le√≥n, James Tomon and Ana Karen Allende. The logo for the gallery is ‚ÄúEl gato Dedrita‚Äù (Dedrita the cat) designed by Joel Nava Polina which represents the playful nature of cats and of their admirers. The gallery also sponsors exhibitions and other events not related to cats but with the aim of promoting local artists. It has shown works by artists such as Jes√∫s Topete, Fumiko Nakashima and Kodai Kita. ==Gato Sombra== The Gato Sombra is a painting of a cat which was owned by artist Odette Paz before it died. The painting has its own niche in the gallery where it is claimed by the artist and others to grant favors for those petitioners who believe in it. Petitioners write small notes to leave with the image. The gallery also sells small images with a prayer. ==Exhibitions== The gallery has a room dedicated to temporary art exhibits which are not necessarily related to cats. It specializes in work by up-and-coming artists, especially those from the Japanese community in Mexico City such as Fumiko Nakashima and Satoji Matoba. ==References== Category:Art museums and galleries in Mexico Category:Mexican art Category:Cats in art Category:2006 establishments in Mexico Category:Art galleries established in 2006 Category:Colonia Roma ","title":"Garros Galer√≠a"},{"id":"35866266","text":"Proboscis in Patau syndrome. Cyclopia (a single median eye) is associated with arrhinia (absence of the nose) and proboscis formation above the eye. In teratology, a proboscis is a blind-ended, tube-like structure, commonly located in the middle of the face. It is commonly seen in severe forms of holoprosencephaly that include cyclopia and is usually the result of abnormal development of the nose. == Types == Proboscis formation is classified in four general types: holoprosencephalic proboscis, lateral nasal proboscis, supernumerary probosci, and disruptive proboscis. === Holoprosencehpalic proboscis === A holoprosencephalic proboscis is found in holoprosencephaly (a condition in which the forebrain of the embryo fails to develop into two hemispheres as it should). In cyclopia or ethmocephaly, proboscis is an abnormally formed nose. In cyclopia, a single eye in the middle of the face is associated with arrhinia (absence of the nose) and usually with proboscis formation above the eye. In ethmocephaly, two separate hypoteloric eyes (eyes placed very close together) are associated with arrhinia and proboscis formation above the eye. In cebocephaly, no proboscis formation occurs, but a single-nostril nose is present. === Lateral proboscis === A lateral proboscis, also known as proboscis lateralis or lateral nasal proboscis, is a tubular proboscis-like structure and represents incomplete formation of one side of the nose; it is found instead of a nostril. The olfactory bulb is usually rudimentary on the side involved in the malformation. The tear duct, nasal bone, nasal cavity, vomer (the small thin bone separating the left and right nasal passages), maxillary sinus, ethmoidal sinuses, and another nasal structure known as the cribriform plate cells are often missing on this side as well. Ocular hypertelorism (eyes set far apart) may be present. The proboscis lateralis is a rare nasal anomaly. === Supernumerary proboscis === A supernumerary proboscis, or accessory proboscis, is found when both nostrils are formed and there is a proboscis in addition to it. Accessory proboscis arise from a supernumerary olfactory placode. === Disruptive proboscis === A disruptive proboscis occurs if an hamartoneoplastic lesion (benign growths such as are found in disorders like neofibromatosis and tubular sclerosis) arises in the prosencephalon (forebrain) of the embryo in its early stages of development. == References == * John M.

Blake J. Evans portrays Wilson in the film. ==Production== Making a film about the founder of an anonymous society presented the filmmakers with challenges. For example, by the time production began, there were few people still alive that knew Wilson, and it first appeared that there was very little visual material available on Wilson. The filmmakers were able to unearth little-seen archival footage and previously unpublished photographs of Wilson and the people in his life. ==Release== The film opened on limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on Friday, May 18, 2012. Prior to its theatrical release, Bill W. screened at the Cleveland International Film Festival. ==PBS Version and Emmy Award== An extensively re-edited and extended ‚Äúdirector‚Äôs cut‚Äù version of the film (116 minutes) was aired on PBS starting in September 2016. This version of the film won an Emmy award in 2017. ==RecognitionCritical response=== Upon its release, the reviews of the film have been favorable. As of May 22, 2012, the film received a 100% positive rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website and a 78 Metascore (with all favorable reviews) on Metacritic. Ernest Hardy in his Village Voice review described the film as \\"a loving, exhaustive, warts-and-all look at the man who spent years battling his own alcoholism before a spiritual experience in the hospital set him on the course to help others.\\" Sheri Linden's review in the Los Angeles Times described Bill W. as \\"a thoroughly engrossing portrait of Wilson, his times and the visionary fellowship that is his legacy.\\" Roger Ebert gave Bill W. three stars out of four, calling it \\"an assembly of styles.

Duke Huan had at least three main wives who bore no sons, six favoured concubines, and more than ten sons. Wukui's mother was the elder Wey Ji, one of the two princesses of the State of Wey who were among Duke Huan's favoured concubines. However, the crown prince of Qi was Prince Zhao (later Duke Xiao), who was born to Zheng Ji, a princess of the State of Zheng. Four other sons of Duke Huan also contended for the throne: Prince Pan (later Duke Zhao), Prince Shangren (later Duke Yi), Prince Yuan (later Duke Hui), and Prince Yong. When Duke Huan died in the tenth month of 643 BC, the six princes fought each other for the throne. After two months of fighting Wukui prevailed and ascended the throne in the twelfth month.

He was trained in Trieste and Venice. He first worked on the restoration of ancient mosaics, including the St Mark's Basilica in Venice. In the 1850s he traveled to France, first to Montpellier, where he was called to work on the restoration of old floors. He filed a patent for a method of extracting ancient mosaic pavements at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 1858, reusing a technique already practiced by Venetian mosaic experts. He also used a derivative of this technique, which allows a prefabricated mosaic to be made in the workshop, facilitating production of the mosaic. In this technique, the mosaic tiles are pre-assembled and glued onto a flexible cardboard; the wall to hold the mosaic is then covered with fresh mortar and mosaic installed at once, reducing the working time on site and allowing a considerable reduction of production costs. This technique was used very successful at the Exposition Universelle (1855) in Paris and spread rapidly. It allowed Facchina get many orders. At Paris, he decorated, among others, the new opera house built by Charles Garnier. Until his death in 1903 Giandomenico Facchina divided his time between his studios in Venice and Paris. ==Main works== * Op√©ra Garnier * Mus√©e Galliera * Mus√©e Gr√©vin * Carnavalet Museum * Petit Palais * Printemps Haussmann * Le Bon March√© * Galerie Vivienne * Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris * Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand * Lyc√©e Chaptal * Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe (now the Biblioth√®que Sainte-Barbe) * Th√©√¢tre Antoine ==References== Category:Italian artists Category:1826 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Mosaic artists Category:People from the Province of Pordenone ","title":"Giandomenico Facchina"},{"id":"35866627","text":"Estanislao Rodr√≠guez-Ponga Salamanca is a Spanish economist who was born in Madrid, 20 March 1956.

Built in 1811, it is a good local example of Federal period architecture, most notable for the well-preserved murals on its interior walls, drawn by the itinerant artist Rufus Porter. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==Description and history== The Moses Kent House stands in a rural setting just south of the Lyme-Orford border, on the east side of River Road north of Clay Brook. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide and two deep, with a symmetrical front facade that has windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The entrance has a fine Federal period surround, set in a shallow recess with flanking narrow pilasters and sidelight windows. The recess is itself framed by pilasters and topped by a half-round fan. The interior has a central hall plan, with two rooms on each side of the hall, which is divided into a front and rear section on the ground floor. The hall, left parlor, and second-floor left parlor chamber each have plaster walls on which murals have been drawn. The murals depict countryside scenes and views of harbors, classic thematic elements of the work of Rufus Porter. left The house was built in 1811 by Moses Kent, and has been little altered structurally since its construction; the only major modification is the addition of a garage at the end of the ell in 1952. The house has seen a variety of residential uses, including as a rental property, summer vacation home, and farmhouse. The interior underwent a careful restoration in the 1980s by historic preservationists familiar with Porter's work, and is now protected under a historic preservation easement. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Grafton County, New Hampshire ==References== Category:Lyme, New Hampshire Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Houses completed in 1811 Category:Houses in Grafton County, New Hampshire Category:Folk art Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grafton County, New Hampshire ","title":"Moses Kent House"},{"id":"35866749","text":"The women's 3 m springboard synchro competition of the diving events at the 2012 European Aquatics Championships was held on May 20.Start list ==Medalists== {  style=\\"text-align:left\\" - align=\\"center\\"  width=200 bgcolor=goldGoldwidth=200 bgcolor=silverSilver width=200 bgcolor=CC9966Bronze - Francesca Dallap√© Tania Cagnotto Hanna Pysmenska Olena Fedorova Katja Dieckow Uschi Freitag } ==Results== The preliminary round was held at 11:00 local time.Preliminary Results The final was held at 17:30.Final Results {   - !rowspan=2Rank !rowspan=2Diver !rowspan=2Nationality !colspan=\\"2\\"Preliminary !colspan=\\"2\\"Final - !Points !Rank !Points !Rank -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftFrancesca Dallap√© Tania Cagnotto align=left 299.40 3 325.50 1 -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftHanna Pysmenska Olena Fedorova align=left 290.70 5 302.10 2 -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftKatja Dieckow Uschi Freitag align=left 302.70 1 296.70 3 -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftAnastasia Pozdniakova Svetlana Filippova align=left 293.52 4 295.80 4 -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftAlicia Blagg Rebecca Gallantree align=left 302.40 2 258.90 5 -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftFl√≥ra Gondos Zs√≥fia Reisinger align=left 249.96 8 251.07 6 -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftDaniella Nero Julia L√∂nnegren align=left 258.42 6 244.86 7 -bgcolor=ccffcc  align=leftInge Jansen Celine van Duijn align=left 256.32 7 242.22 8 -  align=leftEleni Katsouli Ioulianna Banousi align=left 239.43 9   -  align=leftTaina Karvonen Iira Laatunen align=left 239.43 9   - 11 align=leftMagdalena Chlanda Patrycja Pyrzak align=left 226.26 11   } == References == Category:2012 European Aquatics Championships ","title":"Diving at the 2012 European Aquatics Championships ‚Äì Women's 3 m synchro springboard"},{"id":"35866750","text":"The 1988 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State University in the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) during the 1988 NCAA Division I-A football season.

In 1935 with another experienced motorcyclist named Florence Blenkiron, she rode a 600 cc single-cylinder Panther motorcycle complete with sidecar and trailer, from London to Cape Town, South Africa, crossing the Sahara desert, reportedly without a compass. Wallach was the first Vice President of the Women's International Motorcycle Association, and was inaugurated into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2003. == Early life == Born at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, Wallach took her first engine apart on her bedroom floor aged 18. In 1928 she won a scholarship to study engineering at Northampton Polytechnic Institute (now known as City, University of London) and was for some time the only woman engineering student on her course. In 1929 she joined the staff at British Thomson-Houston Co Ltd, Willsden and in the same year she became a member of the Women's Engineering Society, writing that \\"to join is not only a pleasure, but a duty to encourage more girls into the realms of science\\". By 1932 she was working at the Hercules Engineering Company, at Isleworth, run by a Miss Cook. She was already competing in motorcycle races at Brooklands race track by this point. == South African adventure: 11 December 1934 ‚Äì 29 July 1935 == In December 1934 Wallach and Blenkiron departed on an expedition to Africa. They were seen off by Viscountess Astor, five other female MP's, and a host of well wishers. Viscountess Astor remarked that as an \\"unrepentant feminist\\" she would watch their progress with \\"pride and joy\\". Wallach noted that \\"we cannot afford to buy petrol and powder and cigarettes as well, so we just buy petrol\\". The pair travelled from London to Cape Town across the Sahara taking nearly eight months to complete the 13,500 mile journey. Regular updates of their progress were made in the British press. The pair endured extremes of climate, political debacles, mechanical failures and encounters with wild animals. Wallach captured their exploits in her book The Rugged Road (ed. by Barry Jones, 2001, Panther publications: ). Film footage from this journey survives. On 26 May 1936, she gave an account of her adventure to the Women's Engineering Society. The Woman Engineer reported that she referred \\"lightly to the endurance test of the Sahara, the wild beasts that approached sufficiently close for discomfort, though never for real, the snakes that became part of the day‚Äôs experiences, the encounters with tribes in varying degrees of civilisation, the tackling of problems connected with the cycle, with water, with other provisions, including petrol, and, finally to the enthusiastic welcome at Cape Town‚Äù. Several years after this expedition Wallach did not quite know where her future career lay and she placed a newspaper advertisement in 1938 seeking work as a 'Miss X'. The announcement read \\"Timbuctoo or anywhere - young lady holding world motor records wants job. ‚Äì Denham, Bucks\\". == Racing == In the spring of 1939 she gained a British Motorcycle Racing Club Gold Star at Brooklands on a 350 c.c. Norton, for lapping the track at an average speed of more than 100 miles per hour. == Second World War == During the war Wallach used her skills as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (A.T.S.) and became a woman dispatch rider in the British Army. She represented the A.T.S. at the Auto-Cycle Union‚Äôs National Rally 22‚Äì23 July 1939, where she gained a silver plaque. In 1942 she became the first female A.T.S. tank mechanic. == Later life == After the war Wallach toured the United States by motorbike for several years before opening her own motorcycle dealership specializing in British machines. In 1970 she published the successful Easy Motorcycle Riding (1970, Oaktree: ). In 1973 she sold her shop and moved to Phoenix, Arizona where she opened the 'Easy Riding Academy'. In addition to her riding school Wallach was heavily involved in the formation and running of the Women's International Motorcycle Association. She served as WIMA's first Vice President, and was active in the association until her death. Wallach continued to ride motorbikes until she was 88, when vision problems forced her to give up her licence. == References  Further reading == * Category:1909 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Women motorcyclists Category:Long-distance motorcycle riders Category:People from Buckinghamshire Category:Women's Engineering Society Category:Members of the Women's Engineering Society Category:British motorcycle racers ","title":"Theresa Wallach"},{"id":"35866767","text":"Janez Zavrl is a Slovenian association football coach.

With the wearing of European- traditional kinds of earrings, that thickness is not an issue, because jewelry is made to use only thin wire for support, and the wearer need only have a narrow piercing hole to accommodate it. But with body jewelry, there is a wide variety of possible sizes, and wearers generally want jewelry that is the same size as their piercing site. Some wearers want increasingly larger sizes to deliberately stretch the hole. So that wearers can choose the size they want, there are standards for body jewelry sizes, used by jewelry makers and sellers. Generally, the system of gauge-and-inches is used: In gauge notation, jewelry less than ‚Ä≥ thick is typically measured in a system originally devised for measuring wire thickness. A gauge number denotes a thickness on a standardized scale which, for most purposes, starts at 20g (0.812 mm thick‚Äî often used for the posts for nose studs), and increases in thickness (as the gauge number decreases) to 0g, then 00g, and rarely goes any further as these thicknesses come closer and closer to ‚Ä≥. From there, sizes of ‚Ä≥ and thicker are always specified in fractions of an inch. (But note that sizes thinner than ‚Ä≥ are also sometimes specified as fractions of an inch; see the Conversion Table to see how these interleave with gauges.) Even though the gauge system was originally meant for wire, it is now used regardless of whether an item of body jewelry is an actual wire, or is instead a wooden plug, a plastic ring, or any other material.

With metric and gauge: an example item at Body Jewelleryshop. Just in metric: an example item at Neo-Piercing, and an example item at Inoki Piercing. Using millimeters as the primary notation is most common in Europe and Australia. ==Standard sizes of body piercings by location== These are the standard sizes that piercers usually use within the UK to pierce specific locations, and are not totally accurate. The Piercing People Standard Size Guide ==Units and notation== Discussions of gauge in this article use the American Wire Gauge (AWG) scale. Some jewelry may still use the obsolete and significantly different Standard Wire Gauge (SWG) scale instead. Both AWG and SWG express sizes as a gauge, but the numbers are different. For example, AWG 12g is 2.1 mm, but SWG 12g is 2.6 mm. AWG 8g happens to be the same as SWG 10g. AWG 000g is 10.4 mm, but SWG 000g is 9.4 mm. In most discussions of body jewelry, sizes are specified by giving the gauge, usually abbreviated by the suffix \\"g\\", the same symbol as used for grams: \\"12g\\". The article American Wire Gauge system, section \\"Nomenclature and abbreviations in electrical distribution\\" shows other notations for gauge, but most are rarely used for expressing body jewelry sizes, except \\"ga.\\" as in \\"12 ga.\\", which is used occasionally. ==See also== *Jewelry wire gauge *Earring *Body piercing *Body piercing jewelry *Body piercing materials *Wire *Wire gauge comparison chart *IEC 60228, the metric wire-size standard used in most parts of the world. *American Wire Gauge (AWG), used primarily in the US and Canada *Standard Wire Gauge (SWG), the British imperial standard BS3737, superseded by the metric. *Stubs Iron Wire Gauge *Circular mil, Electrical industry standard for wires larger than 4/0. *Number 8 wire, a term used in the New Zealand vernacular ==External links== * SteelNavel.com Body Piercing Jewelry Size Reference ‚Äî illustrating the different ways that size is measured on different kinds of jewelry ==Notes== Category:Wire gauges Category:Customary units of measurement in the United States ","title":"Body jewelry sizes"},{"id":"35866789","text":"Nareli Jain Temple, is a new Jain temple located on the outskirts of Ajmer 7 kilometers from the city center and 128 kilometers west of Jaipur on the main national highway 8.

The technique is the same as for flow Doppler echocardiography measuring flow velocities. Tissue signals, however, have higher amplitude and lower velocities, and the signals are extracted by using different filter and gain settings. The terms tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and tissue velocity imaging (TVI) are usually synonymous with TDE because echocardiography is the main use of tissue Doppler. Like Doppler flow, tissue Doppler can be acquired both by spectral analysis (spectral density estimation) as pulsed DopplerIsaaz K, Thompson A, Ethevenot G, Cloez JL, Brembilla B, Pernot C. Doppler echocardiographic measurement of low velocity motion of the left ventricular posterior wall. Am J Cardiol. 1989 Jul 1;64(1):66-75. and by the autocorrelation technique as colour tissue DopplerMcDicken WN, Sutherland GR, Moran CM, Gordon LN. Colour Doppler velocity imaging of the myocardium. Ultrasound Med Biol. 1992;18(6-7):651-4. (duplex ultrasonography). While pulsed Doppler only acquires the velocity at one point at a time, colour Doppler can acquire simultaneous pixel velocity values across the whole imaging field. Pulsed Doppler on the other hand, is more robust against noise, as peak values are measured on top of the spectrum, and are unaffected of the presence of clutter (stationary reverberation noise). ==Pulsed tissue Doppler echocardiography== This has become a major echocardiographic tool for assessment of both systolic and diastolic ventricular function. However, as this is a spectral technique, it is important to realise that measurement of peak values is dependent on the width of the spectrum, which again is a function of gain setting. ===Clinical use=== Spectral tissue velocity curves from the mitral annulus at the septal (left) and lateral (right) points. The curves show multiple heartbeats. Pulsed wave spectral tissue Doppler has become a universal tool that is part of the general echocardiographic examination. Like any other echocardiographic measurement, measures by tissue Doppler should be interpreted in the context of the whole examination. The velocity curves are in general taken from the base of the mitral annulus at the insertion of the mitral leaflets, in the septal and lateral points of the four chamber view, and eventually the anterior and inferior points of the two-chamber views. For the right ventricle it is customary to use the lateral point of the tricuspid annulus only. Averaging peak velocities from the septal and lateral point has become common, although it has been shown that averaging all four points mentioned above, gives significantly less variabilityThorstensen A, Dalen H, Amundsen BH, Aase SA, Stoylen A.

The curve shows velocities towards the probe (positive velocity) in systole, and away from the probe (negative velocities) in diastole. The most useful measures are the peak velocities, in systole S' and in early diastole (e') and late diastole during atrial contraction (a'). Annular velocities summarize the longitudinal contraction of the ventricle during systole, and elongation during diastole. Peak velocities are commonly used.

J Am Coll Cardiol. 1997 Aug;30(2):474-80 If there is impaired relaxation (Diastolic dysfunction), the e' velocity decreases. After the early relaxation, the ventricular myocardium is passive, the late velocity peak a' is a function of atrial contraction. The ratio between e' and a' is also a measure of diastolic function, in addition to the absolute values. During the two filling phases, there is early (E) and late (A) blood flow from the atrium to the ventricle, corresponding to the annular velocity phases. The flow, is driven by the pressure difference between atrium and ventricle, this pressure difference is both a function of the pressure drop during early relaxation and the initial atrial pressure. In light diastolic dysfunction, the peak early mitral flow velocity E is reduced in proportion to the e', but if relaxation is so reduced that it causes increase in atrial pressure, E will increase again, while e', being less load dependent, remains low. Thus, the ratio E/e' is related to the atrial pressure, and can show increased filling pressure,Nagueh SF, Middleton KJ, Kopelen HA, Zoghbi WA, Quinones MA.

Middle, patient with diastolic dysfunction without increased filling pressure; low E and e', normal E/e' ratio. Left, patient with diastolic dysfunction and increased filling pressure; high E, low e' and high E/e'. The S' is reduced in proportion to the e'. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) One of the main advantages of tissue Doppler is that diastolic and systolic function can be measured by the same tool. Before the advent of tissue Doppler, systolic function was usually assessed with ejection fraction (EF), and diastolic function by mitral flow. This led to the concept of pure \\"diastolic heart failure\\". However, In hypertrophic left ventricles with small cavity size, the systolic function is reduced although EF is not, as the EF is dependent on the relative wall thickness.Maciver DH. A new method for quantification of left ventricular systolic function using a corrected ejection fraction.Eur J Echocardiogr. 2011 Mar;12(3):228-34 This has led to the concept of \\"pure diastolic heart failure\\" being discarded. The preferred term is now heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). This is common and is often seen in hypertensive heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis, and may comprise as much as 50% of the total heart failure population.Hogg K, Swedberg K, McMurray J.Heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function; epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and prognosis. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004 Feb 4;43(3):317-27. The prognosis of HFPEF is the same as for heart failure with dilated hearts.Muntwyler J, Abetel G, Gruner C, Follath F. One-year mortality among unselected outpatients with heart failure.Eur Heart J. 2002 Dec;23(23):1861-6 ===Normal values and physiology=== Normal gender and age related reference values For both S', e' and a' have been established in the large HUNT study, comprising 1266 subjects free of heart disease, hypertension and diabetes.Dalen H, Thorstensen A, Vatten LJ, Aase SA, Stoylen A. Reference Values and Distribution of Conventional Echocardiographic Doppler Measures and Longitudinal Tissue Doppler Velocities in a Population Free from Cardiovascular Disease. 2010 Sep 1;3(5):614-22. Epub 2010 Jun 25. This study also shows that both S' and e' values decline with age, while a' increases (fig). There is also a significant correlation between S' and e', also in healthy subjects, showing the connection between systolic and diastolic function. Age dependent normal values for S', e' and a'.The e'/a' ratio becomes <1 about 60 years of age, which is similar to the E/A ratio of mitral flow. Women has slightly higher S' and e' velocities than men, although the difference disappears with age. The study also did show that velocities were highest in the lateral wall, and lowest in the septum. The E/e' was thus dependent on the site of e' measurement. The ratio was also age dependent. ==Colour tissue Doppler== Colour tissue Doppler traces from a normal subject Left: traces from the septum and mitral ring. The similarities of the curve shape to spectral Doppler is evident. Right: multiple traces from sites along the septum. The decreasing velocities from base to apex is evident. Unlike spectral Doppler, colour tissue Doppler samples velocities from all points of the sector, by shooting two pulses successively, and calculating the velocity from the phase shift between them by autocorrelation. The calculation is slightly different from the true Doppler effect, but the result becomes identical. This results in a single velocity value per sample volume. The result is a velocity field of (nearly) simultaneous velocity vectors towards the probe. The advantage of colour Doppler over spectral Doppler is that all velocities can be sampled simultaneously. The disadvantage is that if there is clutter noise (stationary reverberations), the stationary echoes will be integrated in the velocity calculation, resulting in an under estimate. As pulsed wave Doppler are displayed as a spectrum, the colour Doppler values will correspond to the mean of the spectrum (in the absence of clutter), giving slightly lower values. In the HUNT study, the difference in peak systolic values were about 1.5 cm/s. The local velocities are not the result of the local function, as segments are moved by the action of neighbouring segments. Thus the velocity differences velocity gradient are the main measure of regional contraction, and has become the most important employment of colour tissue Doppler, in the method of strain rate imaging.Heimdal A, Stoylen A, Torp H, Skjaerpe T.

Directed by filmmaker Patricia Zagarella of Lost In Vision Entertainment, the film was picked up by the Style Network as part of their \\"Style Exposed\\" documentary series and first aired on Style on July 9, 2011. The film focuses the Jay and his motivations for embarking on the project, a departure from fashion photography work, as well as on four different women who chose to participate in The SCAR Project, posing for nude portraits revealing their scars from mastectomies, breast reconstruction and other surgeries related to their treatment. ==Themes== Baring It All deals with themes of body image post-cancer, striving to be \\"a story of acceptance, a journey of rediscovery and a celebration of life.\\" Jay began The SCAR Project with a portrait of a friend who had undergone a mastectomy and was surprised to learn that the subject also found the photo shoot beneficial. Many of the women photographed reported similar responses, finding pride and strength through the process of portraiture. The film also explores the reality of cancer and its aftermath of physical and emotional scars. The SCAR Project's name itself is an acronym for \\"Surviving Cancer. Absolute Reality,\\" and many of its promotional materials include the tagline \\"Breast cancer is not a pink ribbon.\\" According to the Style Network's synopsis of the film, \\"Along with exploring the lives of these young females and their new reality, Baring It All shows the impact cancer has had on them and their loved ones and answers what drives them to be photographed at their most vulnerable.\\" ==Production== Zagarella learned of The SCAR Project through a mutual friend and, with co-producer Nicola Bates, soon began work on the project. During much of the filming and production the film's working title was Don't Look Away. Later, when the film was being finalized through Style, the network producers suggested changing it to what they felt was more representative of the subject matter. During filming of the women's photo shoots, only female crew members were used in order to keep the portrait subjects more comfortable. Cinematographers were Mia Barker and Ben Wolf. In post-production, Baring It All was edited by Oliver Lief with sound by Peter Ring and music by Don DiNicola, incorporating several songs from recording artist Christina Blust. ==Release== Baring It All first aired on Style July 9, 2011. The home release became available on DVD July 25, 2011, and includes extra footage of other portrait subjects and their families. The film has been screened at several film festivals, including the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival and Toronto's Breast Fest Film Festival. In 2012 Baring It All received a Daytime Emmy Award. ==References * Category:2011 films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:2011 documentary films Category:American documentary television films Category:Biographical films about photographers Category:Films about fashion photographers Category:Documentary films about cancer Category:Cancer awareness ","title":"Baring It All"},{"id":"35866951","text":"Taphroscelidia is a genus of beetles in the family Passandridae.Passandridae at insects.tamu.edu. ==Species== * Taphroscelidia atra Grouvelle * Taphroscelidia atratula Grouvelle * Taphroscelidia contorta Burckhardt & Slipinski * Taphroscelidia dentata Burckhardt & Slipinski * Taphroscelidia filum Reitter * Taphroscelidia gounellei Grouvelle * Taphroscelidia humeralis Grouvelle * Taphroscelidia linearis Leconte * Taphroscelidia nigra Burckhardt * Taphroscelidia postica Grouvelle * Taphroscelidia rostrata Sharp * Taphroscelidia semicastanea Reitter * Taphroscelidia sharpi Grouvelle * Taphroscelidia tenuissima Reitter ==References== Category:Passandridae ","title":"Taphroscelidia"},{"id":"35866989","text":"Taeniostolella is a monotypic moth genus in the sedge moth family (Glyphipterigidae).

The risk would be to cause serious harm to others, with no effort made to mitigate this risk by the accused. Culpable and Reckless Conduct has no specific definition but deals with culpable and reckless acts which cause injury to others or create the risk of injury. While injury may occur, this would not be deemed as assault as the latter cannot be committed in a reckless or negligent manner. Gordon, supra, at paras [29]-[30], quoted with approval by LJ-C Ross in Harris, supra, at 154. The crime does not deal with events which involve only civil liability such as injuries caused by negligence which does not amount to a criminal act. It does apply to many events which, had they occurred in England and Wales, would have been the same offence whether they were caused intentionally or recklessly but in Scotland fail to fall within the substantive crime due to a lack of intention. This is demonstrated in many cases where an offender is charged with another crime or offence (e.g. wilful fire raising) as well as this crime and the eventual crime or offence(s) for which the offender might be committed is determined by the proven intentions. It will often be charged in parallel with other crimes such as wilful fire raising where it is clear that a criminal offence has occurred but the exact offence(s) committed need to be determined by the facts proven in court. The offence carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment but the circumstances (and thus the eventual sentence applied) of individual cases will often fall short of requiring such a punishment and might not proceed beyond the Sheriff court which has limited sentencing powers. ===Recklessness=== While there is no statutory definition, a summary of what constitutes the crime can be inferred from a draft Scottish Legal CodeA Draft Criminal Code for Scotland with Commentary, pub. Scottish Law Commission 2003 which drew upon current law and proposed the following for a statutory offence of Recklessness :- :Recklessness ::For the purposes of criminal liability ‚éØ ::(a) something is caused recklessly if the person causing the result is, or ought to be, aware of an obvious and serious risk that acting will bring about the result but nonetheless acts where no reasonable person would do so; ::(b) a person is reckless as to a circumstance, or as to a possible result of an act, if the person is, or ought to be, aware of an obvious and serious risk that the circumstance exists, or that the result will follow, but nonetheless acts where no reasonable person would do so; ::(c) a person acts recklessly if the person is, or ought to be, aware of an obvious and serious risk of dangers or of possible harmful results in so acting but nonetheless acts where no reasonable person would do so. ==Case law== The case Her Majesty's Advocate v. HarrisHer Majesty's Advocate v. Harris, 1993 J.C. 150 states how the crime of Culpable and Reckless Conduct will occur; \\"There are two ways in which reckless conduct may become criminal. Reckless conduct to the danger of the lieges will constitute a crime in Scotland and so too will reckless conduct which has caused actual injury\\" ===Reckless injury=== Judicial precedent has developed a crime of unintentionally but recklessly causing injury to another. This has been proposed in case law as an alternative to assault as there no need to prove \\"evil intent\\"MacDonald, Criminal Law, 5th edn, p115 (as would be the case for assault). There is no requirement for the accused to actively or deliberately make efforts to cause injury, provided that it is foreseeable injury could be caused by non-action or an omission and that a causal link exists with the injury. The case of Kimmins v. Nomand,Kimmins v. Nomand, 1993 S.L.T 1260 displays this point, the accused was detained for a legitimately search by police and denied having needles on their person. A police officer subsequently suffered a needle stick injury when searching the accused, who was laterally charged with \\"recklessly causing injury\\". ===Reckless endangerment of the lieges=== In the case of Robson v Spiers,Robson v Spiers, 1999 SLT 1141 establishes the forseeablity of potential danger or injury to the public by the accused's course of action. Again there need not be any physical injury to a person, only the need to demonstrate possible endangerment to the public. A high degree of recklessness is required, more than what could be construed as carelessness or negligence. The accused must have acted in a manner that demonstrated an utter disregard for the consequences of his conduct on the general public and a total indifference to their safety. ==See also== *Reckless endangerment An offence in the United States of America with similar definition. ==References== Category:Scottish criminal law Category:Social ethics Category:Crimes Category:Elements of crime Category:Recklessness (law) ","title":"Culpable and reckless conduct"},{"id":"35867086","text":"Sorangel Matos Arce (born January 2, 1986) is a Panamenian beauty pageant titleholder.

After receiving more songs from the band, however, the label expressed concern about signing what was then a mostly instrumental band with few vocals. An agreement was made to include both instrumental and vocal songs on the album, but during the seven months ultimately taken to finalize the contract, the band rented out a practice space to rehearse and write songs in preparation for the eventual recording process. It was during this process, according to guitarist Derrick Sherman, that the group \\"found [its] sound\\", ultimately abandoning the instrumental songs so as to have \\"a more cohesive record\\". ==Reception== The album received largely positive reviews.

The three kidnappers imprisoned their victims in a buried box truck within a quarry in Livermore, California, intending to demand a ransom for their return. After about 16 hours underground, the driver and children were able to dig themselves out and escape. The quarry owner's son, Frederick Newhall Woods IV, and two of his friends, brothers James and Richard Schoenfeld, were arrested and convicted of the crime. By 2015, both Schoenfelds had been paroled, while Woods remains incarcerated as of fall 2019. == Kidnapping == On Thursday, July 15, 1976 at around 4 p.m., school bus driver Frank Edward \\"Ed\\" Ray was transporting 26 students from the Dairyland Elementary School home from a summer class trip to the Chowchilla fairgrounds swimming pool when a van blocked the road ahead of the bus. Ray stopped the bus and was confronted by three armed men with nylon stockings covering their faces. One of the men held a gun on Ray while another drove the bus; the third man followed in the van. The kidnappers hid the bus in the Berenda Slough, a shallow branch of the Chowchilla River, where a second van had been stashed. Both vans had the windows in the back painted black and interiors reinforced with paneling. Ray and the children were herded into the two vans at gunpoint and then driven around for 11 hours before eventually being taken to a quarry () in Livermore, California. There, in the early morning hours of July 16, the kidnappers forced the victims to climb down a ladder into a buried moving truck that they had stocked with a small amount of food and water and a number of mattresses. Bus driver Ray and the older children eventually stacked the mattresses, enabling some of them to reach the opening at the top of the truck, which had been covered with a heavy sheet of metal and further weighed down with two 100-pound industrial batteries. After hours of effort, Ray and the oldest boy, 14-year-old Michael Marshall, managed to wedge the lid open with a piece of wood and move the batteries; they then dug away the remainder of the debris blocking the entrance. Sixteen hours after they had been forced inside the buried truck, the group emerged and walked to the quarry's guard shack near the Shadow Cliffs East Bay Regional Park. == Arrests and convictions== The quarry owner's son, 24-year-old Frederick Newhall Woods IV, quickly came under suspicion as one of the people who had keys to the quarry and enough access to have buried the moving truck there; he and two of his friends, brothers James and Richard Schoenfeld (aged 24 and 22 respectively) had previously been convicted of grand theft auto, for which they had been sentenced to probation. A warrant was executed on the estate of Woods' father, and there police recovered one of the guns used in the kidnapping as well as a draft of a ransom note, but the three men had fled. Woods was caught two weeks after the kidnapping in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings by Michael Newton (2002) p. 60. James Schoenfeld had been captured earlier the same day in Menlo Park, California, while Richard Schoenfeld had voluntarily turned himself in to authorities eight days after the kidnapping. The kidnappers had been unable to call in their intended ransom demand of $5 million because telephone lines to the Chowchilla Police Department were tied up by media calls and families searching for their children. They went to sleep at some point on Friday the 16th and woke late that night to television news reports informing them that the victims had freed themselves and were safe. James Schoenfeld later stated that despite coming from wealthy families, both he and Woods were deeply in debt: \\"We needed multiple victims to get multiple millions, and we picked children because children are precious. The state would be willing to pay ransom for them. And they don't fight back. They're vulnerable. They will mind.\\" Some details of the crime corresponded to details in \\"The Day the Children Vanished\\", a story by Hugh Pentecost that was published in Alfred Hitchcock's Daring Detectives (1969).Alfred Hitchcock; Arthur Shilstone (1969) Alfred Hitchcock's Daring Detectives, Random House, New York A copy of this book was in the Chowchilla public library, and police theorized that it had inspired the kidnappers. All three perpetrators pleaded guilty to kidnapping for ransom and robbery, but they refused to plead guilty to infliction of bodily harm, as a conviction on that count in conjunction with the kidnapping charge carried a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. They were tried on the bodily harm charge, found guilty and given the mandatory sentence, but their convictions were overturned by an appellate court which found that physical injuries sustained by the children (mostly cuts and bruises) did not meet the standard for bodily harm under the law. They were re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. Richard Schoenfeld was released in 2012 and James Schoenfeld was paroled on August 7, 2015.

A study found that the kidnapped children suffered from panic attacks, nightmares involving kidnappings and death, and personality changes. Many developed fears of such things as \\"cars, the dark, the wind, the kitchen, mice, dogs and hippies\\", and one shot a Japanese tourist with a BB gun when the tourist's car broke down in front of his home. Many of the children continued to report symptoms of trauma at least 25 years after the kidnapping, including substance abuse and depression, and a number have been imprisoned for \\"doing something controlling to somebody else.\\" In 2016, the twenty-five surviving kidnapped children settled a lawsuit they had filed against their kidnappers.

The Chowchilla kidnappings were featured on episode 7 of season 2 of the program House of Horrors: Kidnapped, which airs on the American cable network Investigation Discovery. The episode, \\"Buried Alive\\", first aired on April 21, 2015, and was told from the point of view of Michael Marshall, who at age 14 was the oldest of the children on the bus. An episode of Inside Edition reunited some of the kidnapped women to tell their stories of the kidnappings. The bus from the kidnappings, which is now stored in a Chowchilla farm warehouse, was also seen in the episode.

The RAA is the collective bargaining voice for its members' interests and lobbies on their behalf before the United States Congress, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration and other federal agencies. The RAA represents the financial and economic interests of regional airline employers and regional airline support industry employers. The Regional Airline Association does not represent financial or economic interest of airline employees, either union or other.

Roger Cohen, president of the RAA stated, \\"This tax would place the heaviest burden on regional airlines that provide the only source of scheduled air service to over 75 percent of the nation's airports. This jeopardizes air service to some 500 U.S. communities relying on regional airlines exclusively for their scheduled flights. Make no mistake. This tax jeopardizes air service at places where air service is the only link to the global economy, putting smaller communities out of business.\\" The bill did not pass. ===Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections=== The final rule, which was published on April 25, 2011, as 76 Federal Regulation 23110, includes raising the minimum \\"denied boarding compensation\\" to customers with valid tickets yet still not allowed to board the aircraft. The legislation further penalizes airlines up to $27,500 a passenger if left stranded aboard an aircraft, on a tarmac for more than three hours. In 2010, the Regional Airline Association and all of its member airlines opposed this legislation stating that they could regulate themselves and they already had begun implementing systems by which to mitigate any tarmac delays. Later American Eagle, an RAA airline member, was the first airline to be fined under the new legislation. A total settlement including fines and compensation paid to passengers totaled $800,000 for tarmac delays incurred in Chicago in May 2011. ===1500 Hour Pilot Rule (HR 5900)=== When the bill passed in 2010, the minimum required hours for a pilot to serve as a first officer (co-pilot) in an airline transport capacity was 250 hours. In July 2013, HR 5900 increased this requirement to 1500 hours and possession of an Airline Transport Certificate (ATP). Prior to this, a first officer only needed a Commercial Certificate, while the captain was required to have their ATP. Then Senior Vice President of the RAA, Scott Foose has commented before the Federal Aviation Association that he didn't think the rule had relevance since, as he commented, both of the pilots involved in the crash of Continental Express 3407, which the legislation was inspired by, had over 1500 hours. Foose argued that HR 5900's clause allowing for academic substitution of flight experience should be invoked. Foose said, > The FAA has, through the rule-making process, the opportunity to amend the > ATP standards to allow for academic credit in lieu of some flight time. > Unless the FAA's new rule recognizes the value of some of the new academic > flight training programs, we'll see a decrease in the pilot supply. It's not > just a safety issue. It is also about diminishing service to communities > that are receiving scheduled air service today. Earlier in 2010 however, Cohen, the former RAA president, didn't seem to have those concerns, shortage or not. When addressing the concern of growing disinterest in the occupation of airline pilot, due to both the new 1500 hour rule and plummeting pilot pay, the RAA president stated \\"We're confident our members will be able to navigate any perceived or real pilot shortage, just like we have done historically.\\" ==Controversy== First year regional pilot pay as of Aug. 2011. Source AirlinePilotCentral.com, an industry career site.In recent years the regional airlines are coming under intense scrutiny both from the public and the media. In his film Capitalism: A Love Story, director and film producer Michael Moore profiled how little most regional pilots are paid in the first few years of their careers. Although the industry average starting pay is around $21 per flight hour, hourly wages for regional pilots start at $12.50 an hour. In comparison, a cabbie in New York averages $17 an hour, according to that city's Taxi & Limousine Commission. On Feb 12th, 2010, a year after the crash of Continental Express/Colgan flight 3407, Frontline premiered its WGA Award winning expos√® on the industry entitled \\"Flying Cheap\\". In it, journalist Miles O'Brien questioned the impact such low salaries are having on pilot psyches and how safe this could be for the flying public. When asked to respond to an $18,000 a year first year starting pay Roger Cohen, former president of the Regional Airline Association, said \\"There are many other people who earn less money than that and work more days in these communities that can afford it and do it and do it responsibly.\\" ==See also== * Airlines for America ==References*Families of Continental Flight 3407 Category:Airline trade associations Category:Trade associations based in the United States Category:Regional airlines ","title":"Regional Airline Association"},{"id":"35867399","text":"The Hillsdale Daily News is a daily newspaper published in Hillsdale, Michigan, in the United States.

At Sheffield Wednesday, he let a cross go through his hands onto R√©da Johnson's head to open the scoring. Half-time substitute ≈Ωigiƒá made the score 2‚Äì1, but Wednesday scored on the break, and Marlon King's late penalty was little consolation. Manager Lee Clark took responsibility for the defeat, blaming his use of a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 starting formation.Tattum, Colin (22 August 2012). I am responsible for defeat ‚Äì Lee Clark. Birmingham Mail. Retrieved 22 August 2012. ≈Ωigiƒá started alongside King at Watford, and loanee Ben Gordon made his debut in place of the injured David Murphy, but Steven Caldwell gave away a penalty in the third minute, Birmingham conceded a second goal after 17, and a poor performance was only enlivened when Morgaro Gomis came into the game with 25 minutes left. With Curtis Davies, ≈Ωigiƒá and Darren Ambrose added to the injury list, Birmingham went into the home match against pointless Peterborough United with five teenagers on the substitutes' bench. A farcical own goal by goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik, whose attempted punch of Wade Elliott's free kick went back over his head and bounced over a defender on the line, gave Birmingham their first league win of the season; the goal was later awarded to Elliott. Transfer deadline signing Paul Caddis, making his debut at right back, was named man of the match. Birmingham's first away point of the season came at Nottingham Forest. Substitute Elliott set up King, whose shot was parried to Hayden Mullins who volleyed home from just inside the penalty area, and Nathan Redmond avoided two tackles to cross for King who doubled the lead after 71 minutes. Simon Cox controlled a long aerial ball with one touch and lobbed Butland with a second, and with four minutes remaining, man-of-the- match Pablo Ib√°√±ez deflected the ball into his own net. Loanee Leroy Lita opened the scoring on his home debut in Birmingham's second league win, against Bolton Wanderers, but only days after Stephen Carr was sidelined for six months by knee surgery, Caddis dislocated a shoulder, leaving the team without a recognised right back. The attendance, of 14,693, was their lowest home league crowd for 15 years; according to the Birmingham Mail, fans blamed high ticket prices and financial uncertainty surrounding the club's ownership.Suart, Paul (21 September 2012).

Eight hundred fewer attended the visit of Barnsley, in which Murphy and Pablo went off injured, and Birmingham fan Craig Davies contributed four of the visitors' five goals in a 23-minute second-half spell to inflict Birmingham's worst home league defeat for 25 years. Lee Clark issued a public apology for the \\"embarrassing performance\\".Lewis, Peter (22 September 2012). Clark ‚Äì I apologise . Birmingham City F.C. Retrieved 24 September 2012. Because Murphy's torn hamstring and Pablo's chipped bone in the foot were expected to keep them out for a month, reducing the club to two fit senior defenders, left-back Paul Robinson signed for a month as a free agent. He made a strong debut as Birmingham successfully defended a 1‚Äì0 lead, via Chris Burke's first goal of the season, a volley, at league leaders Brighton & Hove Albion. The second half was delayed for 25 minutes by floodlight failure. ===October‚ÄìNovember=== October began with a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Cardiff City. Lita neatly touched Elliott's free kick home, but Cardiff's goals came from defensive errors: Packwood played them onside for the first, and failure to deal with a corner allowed Mark Hudson to score the winner.

Retrieved 7 October 2012. more than 18,000 saw Birmingham lose 1‚Äì0 to Huddersfield Town; ≈Ωigiƒá was sent off for a high tackle and Mitch Hancox made his competitive debut as substitute for the injured Davies. Clark accused the players of failing to take responsibility, making it clear that he was \\"not sitting in the dressing room telling them not to tackle, to pussyfoot around, telling them to mis-place passes. They can't just hide behind me all the time, they've got to come out fighting.\\" Butland produced what he described as the best performance of his career and Ravel Morrison, selected for the first time since August after problems with his attitude to training led Clark to consider terminating his loan, was influential as Birmingham narrowly failed to beat league leaders Leicester City. Away to Millwall, Birmingham went 3‚Äì0 down in a seven-minute spell in the first half, two of the three scored by former loanee Chris Wood, before Marlon King scored the first hat-trick of his senior career to secure the draw. On his 40th birthday, Lee Clark selected the same starting eleven away at Leeds United, where Lita scored the only goal of the game from . After Redmond gave the ball away in midfield, former Birmingham striker DJ Campbell scored the only goal of a dull meeting with Ipswich Town. ≈Ωigiƒá, returning from suspension as a second-half substitute, missed two clear chances, with a free header and when one-on-one with the goalkeeper. Recalled to the starting eleven, Burke scored his second of the season three days later at home to Bristol City. ≈Ωigiƒá made an assist for King, but his own profligacy continued, and he was clearly annoyed by Peter L√∏venkrands' insistence on taking, and then missing, a stoppage-time penalty. A slow start at Blackburn Rovers was punished by Ruben Rochina's penalty after he was fouled by Murphy, but King equalised after ≈Ωigiƒá hit the post. Robinson, deputising at centre half for the injured Davies, cleared off the line from Jordan Rhodes. For the third time this season, Birmingham went three goals behind, this time at home to Hull City where former Birmingham trainee Sone Aluko scored twice and took the corner that led to the third. Morrison's first goal for the club, a \\"spectacular volley\\" from ≈Ωigiƒá's knockdown, began the attempted fightback, which continued immediately after the break when ≈Ωigiƒá headed on Murphy's long ball to King who wrong-footed the goalkeeper to score his tenth of the season. Terry McDermott said afterwards that \\"to concede three goals at home and in the manner in which we did it is not acceptable to anybody.\\"McDermott ‚Äì 'It was unacceptable' . Birmingham City F.C. 17 November 2012. Retrieved 10 September 2013. The Birmingham Mail's Colin Tattum described the visit to Derby County as \\"a microcosm of what we've witnessed from Blues this campaign\\". An ineffective first half, in which they went one goal down, was followed by a lively second period, in which debutant loanee Rob Hall won a penalty, converted by King, and L√∏venkrands headed a second goal, but the defence was unable to stop Derby regaining the lead. Davies's second-half header from a corner earned Birmingham a point at Blackpool, before November ended with the televised visit of third-placed Middlesbrough. Birmingham conceded after 15 minutes, but in first-half stoppage time, King was fouled by Andr√© Bikey for a penalty from which he equalised. Pablo's defensive hesitancy allowed Middlesbrough to regain the lead before Elliott chested down a defensive clearance on the edge of the penalty area and hit a dipping volley above the goalkeeper's hands. With ten minutes left, L√∏venkrands picked up a loose ball in midfield and played a through ball that King ran onto and placed a \\"clinical finish\\" across the goalkeeper. ===December‚ÄìJanuary=== King's 14th goal of the season came when he sliced a clearance into his own net to gift Wolverhampton Wanderers a win. Crystal Palace took a two-goal lead, and L√∏venkrands was booked for diving in the penalty area, before substitute ≈Ωigiƒá scored a well-placed header with his first touch before Papa Bouba Diop, on his first start, equalised with a powerful header from a corner. Teenage midfielder Callum Reilly made his league debut. Seven teenagers started the match, and ≈Ωigiƒá played as a lone striker after L√∏venkrands was injured during the pre-match warm-up, at home to Burnley. Davies opened the scoring with a header before Charlie Austin's headed equaliser was disallowed when the referee called play back for a foul on the player who had crossed the ball. Burnley took the lead in a two-minute spell in the second half before ≈Ωigiƒá shot under the goalkeeper to equalise in the 89th minute. Two headed goals by Davies gave Birmingham a win at Barnsley to take them seven points clear of the relegation zone, though they were fortunate that Craig Davies, who scored four of Barnsley's five in the reverse fixture, missed a penalty. In what Clark thought \\"was our most inept performance for many, many weeks\\", at Bolton Wanderers, ≈Ωigiƒá scored early but after Bolton secured a two-goal lead, his frustration got the better of him and he was booked twice in quick succession. With no senior striker available, Mullins injured in the warmup, and his replacement, Reilly, injured half an hour into the match, Birmingham lost at home to league leaders Cardiff City by a single goal, tapped in by Joe Mason after Butland failed to deal with a long-range shot. Reilly's first senior goal gave Birmingham the lead as Clark returned to the club that sacked him less than a year earlier, but a 93rd-minute equaliser secured Huddersfield Town a share of the points. Caldwell's header from Hall's corner opened the scoring at home to Brighton & Hove Albion; Brighton took the lead, but in stoppage time, goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak appeared to have substitute ≈Ωigiƒá's header under control but allowed it drop into the net. Davies opened the scoring away at Burnley, again from Hall's corner, then Robinson conceded a penalty from which Ross Wallace equalised. After Dean Marney was sent off, Birmingham had more of the game. ≈Ωigiƒá should have scored when his late header hit the post, but he compensated with a flick-on that King volleyed home. ===February‚ÄìMarch=== Former Birmingham manager Alex McLeish had tried to buy Chris Burke for Nottingham Forest during the January transfer window. Burke showed him what they were missing by scoring twice as Birmingham beat Forest 2‚Äì1, \\"a glorious left-foot effort off the underside of the bar from the edge of the area\\" and a second-half tap-in. On a poor pitch at Charlton Athletic, the home side took the lead after 88 minutes, but Elliott converted Burke's cross for a 94th-minute equaliser. Clark criticised ≈Ωigiƒá for producing \\"possibly the worst training session in terms of a professional footballer I have ever come across\\", and dropped him for the visit of Watford.Nikola Zigic dropped by Birmingham after 'worst training session ever'. Press Association. The Guardian. 15 February 2013. Retrieved 4 July 2013. Birmingham were overrun, losing 4‚Äì0. ≈Ωigiƒá's response was clearly acceptable to Clark, for he returned to the starting lineup for a goalless draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday, Birmingham's first clean sheet for three months, in which he failed to take several chances. February ended with a visit to Peterborough United. ≈Ωigiƒá opened the scoring, Reilly hit the bar from distance, and a deflected Burke shot completed a 2‚Äì0 win, although Butland made what Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson called an \\"unbelievable double save\\", no penalty was awarded when Hancox appeared to foul Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, and Reilly was fortunate to avoid a second yellow card for a \\"cynical trip\\" on Kane Ferdinand.Peterborough United v Birmingham City: Reaction. Sporting Life (UK). 23 February 2013. Retrieved 4 July 2013. Clark substituted Reilly immediately after the incident. Clark's relief at George Boyd's leaving Peterborough lasted one match. Now at Hull City, Boyd took advantage of weak defending to tear Birmingham apart; Hull manager Steve Bruce claimed he \\"didn't know he was that good.\\" Hancox was able to restrict the influence of Blackpool's Tom Ince, but a combination of bad luck, when a shot by L√∏venkrands struck the inside of a goalpost, rolled along the line and came out, and a bad miss by Elliott late in the game restricted Birmingham to a draw. Redmond's first goal of the season, and loanee Wes Thomas's first two, took Birmingham above opponents Derby County and seven points clear of the relegation zone, and ≈Ωigiƒá converted Shane Ferguson's cross at Middlesbrough to take them into the top half of the table for the first time since mid-September. March ended with an unexpected and emphatic 4‚Äì0 win at Crystal Palace, orchestrated by youngsters Redmond ‚Äì according to Clark, \\"a super footballer, he plays high-tempo, he can beat people\\" ‚Äì and Morrison ‚Äì \\"a very, very talented young man ... he's like a kid in the park playing with his mates\\"Pitt-Brooke, Jack (29 March 2013).

Under pressure from ≈Ωigiƒá, Damien Delaney turned the ball into his own net, and the fourth goal was a \\"sumptuous 30-yard free- kick\\" by Ferguson after Morrison was fouled. ===April‚ÄìMay=== In complete contrast, Birmingham went three goals down in the first half at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Elliott scored twice late in the game from the penalty spot ‚Äì the second from the rebound after the penalty was saved ‚Äì and 17-year-old Koby Arthur made his debut.Tattum, Colin (2 April 2013). Birmingham City 2 Wolves 3. Birmingham Mail. Retrieved 9 September 2013. According to Clark, \\"quite simply, without the ball in the first half we were rubbish\\". The visitors' Chris Taylor was the centre of attention as Birmingham drew with Millwall. He was booked for diving when it seemed that Caddis had fouled him, then his goal-bound shot was touched in by teammate Richard Chaplow. Initially disallowed for offside, the referee then awarded a goal because he thought the ball had crossed the line unassisted; when the fourth official informed him that Chaplow had indeed got a touch, he disallowed the goal again. In the second half, Taylor scored the equaliser. A point was gained at Leicester City when Burke converted a stoppage-time penalty awarded when Thomas was fouled outside the area. A 1‚Äì0 win at Bristol City confirmed that club's relegation, and Mullins' second goal of the season at home to Leeds United left Birmingham in 10th place, still mathematically within reach of the play-off positions and finally safe from relegation. In the last away match of the season, Ipswich Town scored three times and had two disallowed in the first hour, a flat, uncompetitive defeat summed up by Clark as \\"I'm three stone overweight and even I could have gone out and played at that tempo.\\" At home to Blackburn Rovers, they attacked from the start, but without reward until the 42nd minute, when Morrison received a pass from Gomis, slipped past two defenders, and shot from low into the corner of the net. Jordan Rhodes tied the scores in the second half, and despite Birmingham's greater possession and number of shots, they needed Robinson's late block of Cameron Stewart's shot to avoid another defeat. Clark said that he envisaged keeping \\"three or four\\" senior players for the next season, but his priority would be \\"building a young vibrant squad\\". He confirmed that the club would be unable to pay transfer fees, and the budget would be sharply reduced, \\"so players coming in will not be getting the same salaries as they have in the past.\\"Lee Clark: 'I am looking forward to the summer.

Dedicated in October 1913, it commemorates the deaths of Archibald Butt (the military aide to President William Howard Taft) and Francis Davis Millet (a journalist and painter, and Butt's close friend and housemate). Both men died during the sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912. ==Genesis of the memorial fountain== Archibald Butt in 1909. Archibald Butt was a Captain in the United States Army Quartermaster Corps who had served in the Philippines (from 1898 to 1904), in Washington, D.C. (from 1904 to 1906), and in Cuba (from 1906 to 1908).\\"Butt, Archibald Willingham DeGraffenreid,\\" in The Encyclopedia of Louisville, p. 150. Theodore Roosevelt had become acquainted with Butt's logistics and animal husbandry work in the Philippines and was impressed by his hard work and thoughtfulness.\\"Major Archibald Butt.\\" New York Times. April 16, 1912. Accessed 2012-05-18. Taft had served as chair of the Second Philippine Commission (the body which was organizing a civilian government in the country in the wake of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the first battles of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War) from 1900 to 1901 and as Governor-General of the Philippines from 1901 to 1904. Taft knew Butt well from their time together overseas. Roosevelt asked Butt to serve as his military aide in April 1908.Gould, p. 208. When Taft became president in March 1909, he asked Butt to stay on as military aide. Butt proved to have strong negotiating skills and a good head for numbers, which enabled him to become Taft's de facto chief negotiator on federal budget issues.Bromley, p. 52. In 1911, Butt was promoted to the rank of major. Butt lived in a large mansion at 2000 G Street NW that was later sold to Senator Underwood from Alabama in 1914 .\\"Maj. Butt's Home Sold.\\" Washington Post. November 22, 1912. Since about 1910, Butt and Millet had lived together in the house.Brewster, p. 30. (Millet's wife, Lily, resided in the Millet home in Italy.) \\"Millet, my artist friend who lives with me\\" was Butt's designation for his companion. They were known for throwing spartan but large parties that were attended by members of Congress, justices of the Supreme Court, and President Taft himself.Davenport-Hines, Richard. \\"The History Page: Unsinkable Love.\\" The Daily. March 20, 2012. Accessed 2012-05-18. Newspapers characterized the intense, deep friendship the men shared as a \\"Damon and Pythias\\" relationship.\\"Millet Planned Trip.\\" Washington Post. April 18, 1912. There is some speculation that Butt and Millet were gay lovers. Historian Richard Davenport-Hines wrote in 2012:Davenport-Hines, Richard. \\"The History Page: Unsinkable Love.\\" The Daily. March 20, 2012. Accessed 2012-05-18. By 1912, Taft's first term was coming to an end. Roosevelt, who had fallen out with Taft, was known to be considering a run for president against him. Close to both men and fiercely loyal, Butt began to suffer from depression and exhaustion.Abbott, pp. xi‚Äìx. Millet (himself one of Taft's circle) asked Taft to give him a leave of absence to recuperate before the presidential primaries began. Taft agreed and ordered Butt to go on vacation.Garrison, p. 89. Butt left on a six-week vacation to Europe on March 1, 1912, accompanied by Millet.\\"Major Butt on Sick Leave.\\" New York Times. March 1, 1912. Butt booked passage on the RMS Titanic for his return to the United States. He boarded the Titanic on April 10, 1912; Millet boarded the ship at Cherbourg, France, later that same day. Butt and Millet were playing cards on the night of April 14 in the first-class smoking room when the Titanic struck an iceberg.Lynch, p. 84. The ship sank two and half hours later, with a loss of over 1,500 lives. Both Butt and Millet went down with the Titanic. Butt's remains were never found.Schemmel, p. 148. Millet's body was recovered on April 27, and he was buried in Bridgewater, Massachusetts.\\"Millet's Body Found.\\" Washington Post. April 28, 1912; \\"Funeral Services for Millet.\\" New York Times. May 2, 1912. Taft was devastated by Butt's death. When he learned Butt had not survived, he \\"broke down and wept, 'his whole body was shaken with convulsive sobs'.\\"Quoted in Stephenson, p. 219. On May 2, 1912, a memorial service was held in the Butt family home in Augusta, Georgia. Taft spoke at the service, almost breaking down twice as he said:Quote in Mowbray, p. xvi. A second ceremony was held in Washington, D.C., on May 5, during which Taft broke down and wept‚Äîbringing his eulogy to an abrupt end.\\"Taft in Tears as He Lauds Major Butt.\\" New York Times. May 6, 1912. ===Building the memorial=== Francis Davis Millet shortly before his death in 1912. On May 16, 1912, Senator Augustus Octavius Bacon of Georgia submitted a resolution in the U.S. Senate authorizing private persons to construct a memorial to Butt and Millet on federally owned land somewhere in the District of Columbia. Bacon argued that Butt (who was an aide to the president) and Millet (who was vice chair of the United States Commission of Fine Arts at the time of his death)Tompkins and Boucher, p. 12. were both public servants who deserved to be memorialized separately from the rest of the dead. Bacon also said that a number of memorials in the city had been financed by private dollars, and the Butt‚ÄìMillet memorial would be no different. As originally introduced, the resolution barred the memorial from being placed on the grounds of the Capitol, Library of Congress, or White House.\\"Asks Memorial Site.\\" Washington Post. May 17, 1912. Bacon asked that the resolution be adopted by the Senate immediately, but Senator William Borah objected and the resolution was referred to the Committee on the Library (which had the authority to accept any work of the fine art on behalf of Congress and designate a location for its placement). Plans for erecting a memorial to Butt and Millet began shortly after the introduction of the Senate resolution. Taft agreed to chair the memorial committee.\\"Memorial to Titanic Dead.\\" Washington Post. October 26, 1913. Taft's personal secretary, Charles D. Hilles, and his military aide, Colonel Spencer Cosby, led the fund-raising on behalf of the committee. Charles J. Bell of the American Security and Trust Company was the treasurer.The Fountain in Memory of..., p. 5. Accessed 2012-05-18. Members of the foreign diplomatic corps and several high government officials had already donated several thousand dollars to the memorial fund by mid-May. Taft himself had made the first contribution. At this point in time, The Ellipse (the southern part of President's Park) was chosen for the site of the memorial. However, the memorial committee was thinking only of erecting a bronze tablet.\\"Butt‚ÄìMillet Memorial.\\" New York Times. May 31, 1912. An attempt to pass the resolution on June 8 failed after Senator Porter J. McCumber objected to its passage.\\"Butt and Millet Tribute.\\" Washington Post. June 9, 1912. The committee favorably reported the resolution on August 10, 1912, and the Senate adopted the resolution on August 12.\\"Favors Butt‚ÄìMillet Shaft.\\" Washington Post. August 13, 1912. The House of Representatives received the committee's report on August 22,\\"For Butt‚ÄìMillet Titanic Memorial.\\" New York Times. August 23, 1912. and passed the legislation the following day.\\"Deadlock Keeps Congress Sitting.\\" New York Times. August 25, 1912. As enacted, the resolution removed the restriction on the memorial's location.The Fountain in Memory of..., p. 6. Accessed 2012-05-18. Taft signed the legislation into law on August 24. During work on the congressional legislation, the memorial commission altered its plans. Despite press reports that the memorial would be a bronze tablet, a fund-raising letter issued in May 1912 by the memorial commission said the memorial's final form had not been chosen. That changed in early June, when the commission decided to add a fountain to the tablet.Committee on the Library, p. 1. Accessed 2012-05-18. The memorial commission had also settled on Thomas Hastings and Daniel Chester French as the memorial's designers. By late August 1912, the commission eliminated the tablet in favor of just a fountain. By April 1913, the memorial commission had added a shaft with two bas-relief figures‚Äîone representing chivalry (Butt) and one representing art (Millet).\\"Monument to Maj. Butt.\\" Washington Post. April 13, 1913. By law, both the President and the Commission of Fine Arts had to approve the location and design of the memorial.Committee on the Library, p. 2. Accessed 2012-05-18. Both approvals were given, and work on the foundation for the fountain began on June 18, 1913.\\"Monument to Butt Soon.\\" New York Times. June 19, 1913. Just over $3,000 was spent constructing the memorial fountain. Hastings and French donated their services.The Fountain in Memory of..., p. 7. Accessed 2012-05-18. Initial press reports in 1912 indicated that Taft planned an elaborate dedication ceremony for the memorial. But Taft was no longer president by late 1913, having lost the presidential election to Woodrow Wilson. The Butt‚ÄìMillet Memorial Fountain was dedicated without ceremony on October 25, 1913. Among the donors to the memorial were John Dustin Archbold, Henry Bacon, Daniel Burnham, Arno B. Cammerer, Champ Clark, Kenyon Cox, Frank Miles Day, Theodore N.

An octagonal grey granite baseCarrier, p. 88. supports an wide bowl of golden brown Tennessee marble. A grey granite Neoclassical column rises from the center of the bowl.

The southern figure of a man in armor and helmet, holding a shield, represents military valor. Four globes in the bowl surround the granite column and emit water, which cascades over the edge of the bowl into a shallow receptacle in the grey granite base. The fountain bowl was designed to be a source of drinking water for horses used by park police patrols. An inscription around the lip of the bowl reads: \\"In memory of Francis Davis Millet ‚Äì 1846‚Äì1912 ‚Äì and Archibald Willingham Butt ‚Äì 1865‚Äì1912.

A digital app version of the game has also been released. ==Gameplay== The gameplay of Zombie Dice is simple. The player has to shake a cup containing 13 dice and randomly select 3 of them without looking into the cup and then roll them. The faces of each die represent brains, shotgun blasts or \\"runners\\" with different colours containing a different distribution of faces (the 6 green dice have 3 brains, 1 shotgun and 2 runners, the 4 yellow dice have 2 of each and the 3 red dice have 1 brain, 3 shotguns and 2 runners). The object of the game is to roll 13 brains. If a player rolls 3 shotgun blasts their turn ends and they lose the brains they have accumulated so far that turn. It is possible for a player to roll 3 blasts in a single roll, but if only one or two blasts have been rolled the player will have to decide whether it is worth it to risk rolling again or \\"bank\\" the brains acquired so far and pass play to the next player. A \\"runner\\" is represented by feet and rolling a runner means that the player can roll that same dice if they choose to press their luck. A winner is determined if a player rolls 13 brains and all other players have taken at least one more turn without reaching 13 brains. ==Awards== Zombie Dice was the winner of the 2011 Origins Awards for a Family, Children's or Party game. ==Expansions== Zombie Dice 2: Double Feature is an expansion released in 2012. Three new dice are included, replacing three of the dice from the original: the Hunk, the Hottie, and Santa Claus. Each has its own unique abilities. The Hunk die has a double shotgun and a double brain, the Hottie has extra feet, and Santa Claus has three special gifts: a helmet (to let one take an additional shotgun blast), an energy drink (to capture the brain of a runner), and a double brain. Zombie Dice 3: School Bus comes with one yellow 12-sided die that represents a school bus with many young brains. Different sides include one side with three brains, and one with two brains and a shotgun blast. ==References Category:Games and sports introduced in 2010 Category:Dice games Category:IOS games Category:Origins Award winners Category:Steve Jackson (American game designer) games Category:Steve Jackson Games games Category:Tabletop games Category:Zombies ","title":"Zombie Dice"},{"id":"35867739","text":"The Ionia Sentinel-Standard is a newspaper published Saturday in Ionia in the US state of Michigan.

The trolleybuses of Roma Condesa are permanently parked trolleybuses in the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods of Mexico City that were used for art and other projects. Most were Japanese buses that were donated to Servicio de Transportes El√©ctricos by the Kansai Electric Power Company in Japan in 1994, for possible operation, which never came to fruition, and in 2000 they were repurposed by Cuauht√©moc borough in a programme to create educational centers. However, the Trolebuses Educativos programme lasted only a few months. Some of the trolleybuses remained in use as simple reading rooms, but others sat abandoned until 2005, when the ‚ÄúGaler√≠a Troleb√∫s‚Äù (Trolleybus Gallery) was begun to promote non-traditional art projects. The gallery ceased operations in 2009 due to financial problems, but the buses continued to be used for art projects until about 2014. Two other trolleybuses involved were not Japanese vehicles. ==Origin== The three Japanese trolleybuses were part of a group of nine that were donated to Mexico's Servicio de Transportes El√©ctricos in the mid-1990s, for possible use in service on the city's trolleybus system, and were transported to Mexico City between 1994Trolleybus Magazine (TM) No. 199 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1995), pp. 21 and 23. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . and 1997, but ultimately were never placed in service.Trolleybus Magazine No. 317 (September‚ÄìOctober 2014), p. 134. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . The trolleybuses were built between 1964 and 1968 by Mitsubishi as Models 100 and 200 for the Kansai Denryoku company and operated on the Kanden Tunnel Trolleybus line. The two models are distinguished by the number of doors: one and two, respectively. All of the trolleybuses have doors only on their left sides (except for a small emergency exit door near the rear), because Japan is a country where traffic drives on the left, which made their configuration impractical for operation in Mexico City. In late 1994, STE rebuilt the first unit, No. 117, for right-hand trafficTrolleybus Magazine No. 202 (July‚ÄìAugust 1995), pp. 106‚Äì107. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . ‚Äì with doors on the right and steering wheel on the left ‚Äì but judged the conversion to be too expensive.Trolleybus Magazine No. 233 (September‚ÄìOctober 2000), p. 118. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . No other vehicles were converted, and none of the nine ever entered service. One of the trolleybuses when it was still painted for the \\"Trolebuses Educativos\\" programme, in 2011. This is the bus's right side, and the trolley poles have been swung around to point towards the front end. In spring 2000, all were donated to Cuauht√©moc borough for use as children's educational centers and reading rooms placed near libraries, in a programme known as the ‚ÄúTrolebuses Educativos‚Äù programme.Trolleybus Magazine No. 235 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2001), p. 14. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . That programme ended after only three months, at the end of August 2000, and some of the trolleybuses were moved to storage, while others remained on the street, disused. (One, No. 118, returned to STE, but no longer operational.) Some were returned to use later as children's reading rooms, but others sat abandoned in various parts of Mexico City, mainly still in the Cuauht√©moc borough. In 2012, there were three that remained in use for art projects, one permanently parked in Colonia Hip√≥dromo by Parque Espa√±a, one in Colonia Roma next to Plaza Luis Cabrera and one next to Parque M√©xico in Colonia Condesa. When serving the Kanden Tunnel Trolleybus line, the buses travelled through a tunnel between Ogizawa and Kurobe Dam in the Toyama Prefecture, and the one now at Parque Espa√±a has references to this history on the sign on its windshield. The Kanden Tunnel bus line still operates, but battery-powered buses replaced the trolleybuses in 2018‚Äì19. The vehicles were donated to Cuauht√©moc in 2000. Initially they sat abandoned until the Galer√≠a Troleb√∫s project. ==Galer√≠a Troleb√∫s== From 2000 and 2005, the three buses sat abandoned until Ariadna Ramonetti discovered them and worked to create the Galer√≠a Troleb√∫s (Trolleybus Gallery) in cooperation with the Cuauht√©moc borough to promote non-traditional art projects. Artists who worked with the vehicles from 2005‚Äì09 included Karen Cordero, Ana Elena Mallet, Santiago Espinoza de los Monteros and Antonio Calera. Some of the art projects included light and sound. In 2006, Montiel Klint inhabited the trolleybus at the north end of Plaza Luis Cabrera in Colonia Roma, blocked from view for two months with only eight photographs on the outside of the bus for visitors to see. The interior of the bus was covered with about 5,000 paper cups to isolate it from the outside. The work was called the Galeria Experimental de Arte (Experimental Gallery of Art). ‚ÄúSuspended Black‚Äù by V√≠ctor Noxpango had one of the trolleybuses elevated on six hydraulic jacks and painted completely black. After artist Israel Meza Moreno created a work called Nido de Malvivientes in 2007 with one of the trolleybuses, the Fundaci√≥n Jumex commissioned a similar work, which was bought by a private collector and later acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The work consisted of covering the interior of the trolleybus with cardboard pieces on which phrases from young thieves whom the artists had interviewed were written. The windows were covered with newspaper front pages with violent headlines. Alvaro Verduzco's work was called ‚ÄúT√∫nel‚Äù (Tunnel) in 2009, which used a cone made of cardboard with the bus to create the illusion of infinity. The gallery ceased operations due to financial difficulties. The various projects that took place during that time drew both praise and criticism from the residents of the various neighborhoods. The art projects were best received in Colonia Roma and least in Colonia Condesa. ==Post-Galer√≠a== Japanese trolleybus at the north end of Plaza Luis Cabrera, in Colonia Roma, in 2012 After 2009, the three trolleybuses remained in their respective locations for some time. The borough government still allowed artists, community members and even advertisers to paint the buses periodically, painting over whatever was there previously. In February 2012, the trolleybus in Colonia Hip√≥dromo was painted by Japanese artist Fumiko Nakashima with her work given the title of ‚ÄúDoble Vida‚Äù or ‚ÄúDouble Life.‚Äù The work was to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, along with a ceremony on March 11, 2012. The work was part of a public art program called Haru ga kita (Spring comes) en M√©xico under this artist along with musician Emiliano Isamu. It was sponsored by the Garros Galer√≠a in Mexico City, the Fundaci√≥n Jap√≥n M√©xico and the Cuauht√©moc borough. The TATSA- rebodied Marmon-Herrington trolleybus (former STE No. 5122), one of only two non-Japanese trolleybuses painted as public art, in 2012. It was at the south end of Plaza Luis Cabrera, but was removed in 2014. Two trolleybuses that were used as canvasses for public art in Colonia Hip√≥dromo (in Condesa) or Colonia Roma were not former Japanese vehicles. One is a MASA trolleybus built for STE in the 1980s. It was parked as an art installation in the southern part of Parque M√©xico until early 2009, then moved east to Calle Toluca behind the Jard√≠n Ram√≥n L√≥pez Velarde, where it remained until 2014. The other vehicle, formerly STE No. 5122, is an American-built Marmon-Herrington trolleybus whose chassis was built in 1948 but which was retrofitted with a new, modern body ‚Äì with a slanted front end shape ‚Äì in 1993 by a company named TATSA (Tanques de Acero Trinity S.A.). In 1997, it was converted to compressed natural gasTrolleybus Magazine No. 220 (July‚ÄìAugust 1998), p. 93.

Later, between 2010/2011 and 2014, it was parked at the south end of Plaza Luis Cabera and used as an artistic canvas, wearing a few different artistic designs during that period. ==See also== * Trolleybuses in Mexico City ==References * Category:Mexican art Category:Colonia Roma Category:Condesa Category:Culture in Mexico City ","title":"Trolleybuses of Roma‚ÄìCondesa"},{"id":"35867768","text":"Government Senior Secondary School Mamring, East Sikkim is a government, co- educational, English medium school situated at Mamring near Pakyong in East district of Sikkim, India.

It is situated on Place de la Fontaine aux Lions within the Parc de la Villette, in the 19th arrondissement. While the Grande Halle is within Paris' main abattoir district, the historical building now serves as a venue for trade fairs, exhibitions, music festivals, and open-air cinema. ==History== La Villette (\\"a world apart\\") was a warehouse district and industrial section of northeastern Paris, stretching within a plain formed between the Goutte d'Or and the Buttes-Chaumont, and built around the Canal de l'Ourcq and the Canal Saint- Denis. As part of Haussmann's renovation of Paris, Baron Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann proposed concentrating all the abattoirs and meat markets on the city's outskirts at La Villette. The Grande halle de la Villette, 1867, pictured between the other two slaughterhouses. Designed by Jules de M√©rindol and Louis-Adolphe Janvier (1818‚Äì1878), construction of the Grande Halle took place during the period of 1865‚Äì1867. While the La Villette complex opened in the 1860s with a total of three market halls, only the Grande Halle aux Boeufs, preserved for its architectural value, survives. La Villette took on a nickname la Cit√© du Sang (\\"city of blood\\") by butchers, or La Villetouse in slang. In 1970, the City of Paris ceded Villette's land and its management to the national government, and four years later, Villette's slaughterhouses ceased operations. In 1979, l'Etablissement Public du Parc de la Villette (EPPV) was created to restore and manage Villette's 55 hectare site; and the slaughterhouse/market became a Monument historique. Fran√ßois Mitterrand's 1982 announcement of Les Grands Projets' included Parc de la Villette, and in that year, Bernard Reichen and Philippe Robert were selected for the Grande Halle's restoration. After renovation completion, Mitterrand opened the restored Grande Halle in January 1985. In 1993, by government decree No. 93-96, the EPPV was renamed L‚ÄôEtablissement public du Parc et de la grande halle de la Villette (\\"The Public Establishment of the Park and the Great Hall de la Villette\\"; EPPGHV). Another Grande Halle renovation occurred in 2005‚Äì2007. The production designer Guy-Claude Fran√ßois collaborated with architects in the conception of the hall's performance stage. ==Architecture and fittings== The Grande Halle is made of cast iron and glass. It covers an area of , and measures by . Three sides are open while the fourth, made of glass, is the entrance to the hall. Speakers are hung from hooks on the overhead canopy and not easily visible to the public in order to separate the listener from the building's technical elements; however, there is a slight reverberation because of the glass roof. The hall's far end is described as the central axis of the building's main visual field. Plans for an organic restaurant by architects Gilles & Boissier include using an adjacent garden as a source for menu requirements; Caf√© de la Villette is in size. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the 19th arrondissement of Paris Category:Monuments historiques of Paris Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1867 Category:Cultural centers Category:1867 establishments in France ","title":"Grande halle de la Villette"},{"id":"35867835","text":"Ernst Kretschmer (born 3 July 1951) is a linguistics professor at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, and the 1990 winner of the Kassel Literary Prize. ==References *Official Site at the University of Modena Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:Linguists from Germany ","title":"Ernst Kretschmer (linguist)"},{"id":"35867852","text":"Ussara chalcodesma is a species of sedge moth in the genus Ussara.

They are generally site-specific, usually projected on multiple planes, suggestive of rooms.DeBevoise, Jane- \\"A Walkthrough with Tabaimo\\", Asia Art Archive in America; http://www.aaa-a.org/programs/a-walkthrough-with-tabaimo/ retvd 12 4 16 Pop artist Keiichi Tanaami, an instructor at Kyoto University, was an important early influence, and Tabaimo's work features elements of manga and anime, but is also inspired by traditional Japanese art forms, particularly ukiyo-e woodblock printing.Art Gallery NSW; Tabaimo artist biography/collection guide; https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/236.2014/ retvd 12 3 16 Birds, insects, sea creatures, and tortoises often appear in her work, intermingling with humans and disembodied human parts in both natural and urban environments, which at times morph into surreal landscapes. The transformation of familiar objects and situations has the effect of not only questioning their meaning, but challenging the viewer's perception of the work itself: \\"I don‚Äôt just put the work in front of them and make it a comfortable experience for them ‚Äì they need to be proactive in their viewing if they are to understand what I‚Äôm saying.

For some such methods, such as support vector machines (SVMs), the original formulation and its regularization were not Bayesian in nature. It is helpful to understand them from a Bayesian perspective. Because the kernels are not necessarily positive semidefinite, the underlying structure may not be inner product spaces, but instead more general reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In Bayesian probability kernel methods are a key component of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is known as the covariance function. Kernel methods have traditionally been used in supervised learning problems where the input space is usually a space of vectors while the output space is a space of scalars. More recently these methods have been extended to problems that deal with multiple outputs such as in multi-task learning. A mathematical equivalence between the regularization and the Bayesian point of view is easily proved in cases where the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. The infinite-dimensional case raises subtle mathematical issues; we will consider here the finite-dimensional case. We start with a brief review of the main ideas underlying kernel methods for scalar learning, and briefly introduce the concepts of regularization and Gaussian processes. We then show how both points of view arrive at essentially equivalent estimators, and show the connection that ties them together. ==The supervised learning problem== The classical supervised learning problem requires estimating the output for some new input point \\\\mathbf{x}' by learning a scalar-valued estimator \\\\hat{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}') on the basis of a training set S consisting of n input- output pairs, S = (\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}) = (\\\\mathbf{x}_1,y_1),\\\\ldots,(\\\\mathbf{x}_n,y_n). Given a symmetric and positive bivariate function k(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) called a kernel, one of the most popular estimators in machine learning is given by where \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\equiv k(\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{X}) is the kernel matrix with entries \\\\mathbf{K}_{ij} = k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_j), \\\\mathbf{k} = [k(\\\\mathbf{x}_1,\\\\mathbf{x}'),\\\\ldots,k(\\\\mathbf{x}_n,\\\\mathbf{x}')]^\\\\top, and \\\\mathbf{Y} = [y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n]^\\\\top. We will see how this estimator can be derived both from a regularization and a Bayesian perspective. ==A regularization perspective== The main assumption in the regularization perspective is that the set of functions \\\\mathcal{F} is assumed to belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}_k. ===Reproducing kernel Hilbert space=== A reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) \\\\mathcal{H}_k is a Hilbert space of functions defined by a symmetric, positive-definite function k : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} called the reproducing kernel such that the function k(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\cdot) belongs to \\\\mathcal{H}_k for all \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}. There are three main properties make an RKHS appealing: 1\\\\. The reproducing property, which gives name to the space, : f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\langle f,k(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\cdot) \\\\rangle_k, \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\ f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_k, where \\\\langle \\\\cdot,\\\\cdot \\\\rangle_k is the inner product in \\\\mathcal{H}_k. 2\\\\. Functions in an RKHS are in the closure of the linear combination of the kernel at given points, : f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_i k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x})c_i . This allows the construction in a unified framework of both linear and generalized linear models. 3\\\\. The squared norm in an RKHS can be written as :\\\\f\\\\_k^2 = \\\\sum_{i,j} k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_j) c_i c_j and could be viewed as measuring the complexity of the function. ===The regularized functional=== The estimator is derived as the minimizer of the regularized functional where f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_k and \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_k is the norm in \\\\mathcal{H}_k. The first term in this functional, which measures the average of the squares of the errors between the f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) and the y_i, is called the empirical risk and represents the cost we pay by predicting f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) for the true value y_i. The second term in the functional is the squared norm in a RKHS multiplied by a weight \\\\lambda and serves the purpose of stabilizing the problem as well as of adding a trade-off between fitting and complexity of the estimator. The weight \\\\lambda, called the regularizer, determines the degree to which instability and complexity of the estimator should be penalized (higher penalty for increasing value of \\\\lambda). ===Derivation of the estimator=== The explicit form of the estimator in equation () is derived in two steps. First, the representer theorem states that the minimizer of the functional () can always be written as a linear combination of the kernels centered at the training-set points, for some \\\\mathbf{c} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. The explicit form of the coefficients \\\\mathbf{c} = [c_1,\\\\ldots,c_n]^\\\\top can be found by substituting for f(\\\\cdot) in the functional (). For a function of the form in equation (), we have that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\f\\\\_k^2 & = \\\\langle f,f \\\\rangle_k, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\cdot), \\\\sum_{j=1}^N c_j k(\\\\mathbf{x}_j,\\\\cdot) \\\\right\\\\rangle_k, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{j=1}^N c_i c_j \\\\langle k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\cdot), k(\\\\mathbf{x}_j,\\\\cdot) \\\\rangle_k, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{j=1}^N c_i c_j k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_j), \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\mathbf{c}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{c}. \\\\end{align} We can rewrite the functional () as : \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{y} - \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{c} \\\\^2 + \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{c}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{c}. This functional is convex in \\\\mathbf{c} and therefore we can find its minimum by setting the gradient with respect to \\\\mathbf{c} to zero, :\\\\begin{align} -\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\mathbf{K} (\\\\mathbf{Y} - \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{c}) + \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{c} & = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\lambda n \\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\mathbf{c} & = \\\\mathbf{Y}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{c} & = (\\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\lambda n \\\\mathbf{I})^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Y}. \\\\end{align} Substituting this expression for the coefficients in equation (), we obtain the estimator stated previously in equation (), : \\\\hat{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}') = \\\\mathbf{k}^\\\\top(\\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\lambda n \\\\mathbf{I})^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Y}. ==A Bayesian perspective== The notion of a kernel plays a crucial role in Bayesian probability as the covariance function of a stochastic process called the Gaussian process. ===A review of Bayesian probability=== As part of the Bayesian framework, the Gaussian process specifies the prior distribution that describes the prior beliefs about the properties of the function being modeled. These beliefs are updated after taking into account observational data by means of a likelihood function that relates the prior beliefs to the observations. Taken together, the prior and likelihood lead to an updated distribution called the posterior distribution that is customarily used for predicting test cases. ===The Gaussian process=== A Gaussian process (GP) is a stochastic process in which any finite number of random variables that are sampled follow a joint Normal distribution. The mean vector and covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution completely specify the GP. GPs are usually used as a priori distribution for functions, and as such the mean vector and covariance matrix can be viewed as functions, where the covariance function is also called the kernel of the GP. Let a function f follow a Gaussian process with mean function m and kernel function k, : f \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{GP}(m,k). In terms of the underlying Gaussian distribution, we have that for any finite set \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{n} if we let f(\\\\mathbf{X}) = [f(\\\\mathbf{x}_1),\\\\ldots,f(\\\\mathbf{x}_n)]^\\\\top then : f(\\\\mathbf{X}) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{m},\\\\mathbf{K}), where \\\\mathbf{m} = m(\\\\mathbf{X}) = [m(\\\\mathbf{x}_1),\\\\ldots,m(\\\\mathbf{x}_N)]^\\\\top is the mean vector and \\\\mathbf{K} = k(\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{X}) is the covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. ===Derivation of the estimator=== In a regression context, the likelihood function is usually assumed to be a Gaussian distribution and the observations to be independent and identically distributed (iid), : p(yf,\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\sigma^2) = \\\\mathcal{N}(f(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\sigma^2). This assumption corresponds to the observations being corrupted with zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance \\\\sigma^2. The iid assumption makes it possible to factorize the likelihood function over the data points given the set of inputs \\\\mathbf{X} and the variance of the noise \\\\sigma^2, and thus the posterior distribution can be computed analytically. For a test input vector \\\\mathbf{x}', given the training data S = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\\\\}, the posterior distribution is given by : p(f(\\\\mathbf{x}')S,\\\\mathbf{x}',\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}) = \\\\mathcal{N}(m(\\\\mathbf{x}'),\\\\sigma^2(\\\\mathbf{x}')), where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi} denotes the set of parameters which include the variance of the noise \\\\sigma^2 and any parameters from the covariance function k and where :\\\\begin{align} m(\\\\mathbf{x}') & = \\\\mathbf{k}^\\\\top (\\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathbf{I})^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Y}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma^2(\\\\mathbf{x}') & = k(\\\\mathbf{x}',\\\\mathbf{x}') - \\\\mathbf{k}^\\\\top (\\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathbf{I})^{-1} \\\\mathbf{k}. \\\\end{align} ==The connection between regularization and Bayes== A connection between regularization theory and Bayesian theory can only be achieved in the case of finite dimensional RKHS. Under this assumption, regularization theory and Bayesian theory are connected through Gaussian process prediction. In the finite dimensional case, every RKHS can be described in terms of a feature map \\\\Phi : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^p such that : k(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}') = \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\Phi^i(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\Phi^i(\\\\mathbf{x}'). Functions in the RKHS with kernel \\\\mathbf{K} can be then be written as : f_{\\\\mathbf{w}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\mathbf{w}^i \\\\Phi^i(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{w},\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\rangle, and we also have that : \\\\f_{\\\\mathbf{w}} \\\\_k = \\\\\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\. We can now build a Gaussian process by assuming \\\\mathbf{w} = [w^1,\\\\ldots,w^p]^\\\\top to be distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero mean and identity covariance matrix, : \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0,\\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\propto \\\\exp(-\\\\\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\^2). If we assume a Gaussian likelihood we have : P(\\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\mathbf{X},f) = \\\\mathcal{N}(f(\\\\mathbf{X}),\\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\propto \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\ f_{\\\\mathbf{w}}(\\\\mathbf{X}) - \\\\mathbf{Y} \\\\^2\\\\right), where f_{\\\\mathbf{w}}(\\\\mathbf{X}) = (\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{w},\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)\\\\rangle,\\\\ldots,\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{w},\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n \\\\rangle) . The resulting posterior distribution is the given by : P(f\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}) \\\\propto \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\f_{\\\\mathbf{w}}(\\\\mathbf{X}) - \\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\_n^2 + \\\\\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\^2\\\\right) We can see that a maximum posterior (MAP) estimate is equivalent to the minimization problem defining Tikhonov regularization, where in the Bayesian case the regularization parameter is related to the noise variance. From a philosophical perspective, the loss function in a regularization setting plays a different role than the likelihood function in the Bayesian setting. Whereas the loss function measures the error that is incurred when predicting f(\\\\mathbf{x}) in place of y, the likelihood function measures how likely the observations are from the model that was assumed to be true in the generative process. From a mathematical perspective, however, the formulations of the regularization and Bayesian frameworks make the loss function and the likelihood function to have the same mathematical role of promoting the inference of functions f that approximate the labels y as much as possible. ==See also== * Regularized least squares * Bayesian linear regression * Bayesian interpretation of Tikhonov regularization ==References== Category:Bayesian statistics Category:Machine learning ","title":"Bayesian interpretation of kernel regularization"},{"id":"35867903","text":"Ussara olyranta is a species of sedge moth in the genus Ussara.

Von der Ahe (1883-1973) and Linda Luer (1887-1973). He was one of eight children, with five boys and three girls: Theodore, Wilfred, Karl, Walter, Virginia, Clyde, Muriel, and Dorothy. Von der Ahe was married to Mary Jane Von der Ahe (1911-2006, n√©e Smith) in 1934, and they remained married for 64 years until his death. They had four children and 18 grandchildren. == Vons Grocery Company == Von der Ahe's father Charles had opened Vons Groceteria in 1906, and expanded to 87 stores by 1928, but he sold the business a year later. A few years later, Von der Ahe and his brother Ted (Theodore) convinced their father Charles to provide financial backing, and they opened the Vons Grocery Company in 1932. In 1948, Vons opened a pioneering store which offered self-service, pre-packaged produce, meat, and deli items, which has been called by some the first supermarket and established Vons and Von der Ahes as leaders in the industry. Many features of supermarkets today, such as volume buying, the big store, the open refrigerated case, centralized meat-cutting, and the cent-off food coupon stem from the early days of competition between Vons and Ralphs. By 1958, Vons was the third-largest grocery chain in the Greater Los Angeles Area. When the company went public, Vons had annual sales of $100 million and 28 stores. In 1960 it acquired the sixth-largest competitor Shopping Bag Food Stores, a merger that was challenged by the Federal Trade Commission on antitrust grounds. In 1966 the United States Supreme Court ruled against Vons in United States v. Von's Grocery Co. (384 U.S. 270), forcing a re-divestiture of the stores. The Von der Ahe family sold the chain to Household Finance Corporation in 1969. In 1970, Vons had 128 stores, making it the 2nd largest supermarket chain in southern California behind Safeway. By the end of 2011, Vons had 325 stores across Southern California and Nevada. Jack Brown, chairman of Colton- based Stater Bros., a chain of 112 stores in Southern California, said Von der Ahe was a force in the industry in the 1950s, '60s and '70s. \\"People from all over the world came to Southern California to see supermarkets and see the latest technology and merchandising ideas that were being put in place and Vons certainly led the pack at that time,\\" Brown said. \\"Will was very much a two-fisted competitor but was always very generous with his knowledge and that helped the industry in total. But having a store across the street from him was no cakewalk. The tougher he got the tougher we had to get and the customer benefited,\\" Brown recalled. After the sale to Household Finance Corporation, Von der Ahe stayed on as Corporate Vice President until he retired in 1975 == Other activities == He played a leadership role in the food industry, serving as vice president of the Supermarket Institute, vice president of the National Association of Food Chains, and President of the California Grocers Association. Von der Ahe also continued to engage in community and civic leadership, serving on numerous boards, and engaging in philanthropy of Catholic and educational institutions as president of the Von der Ahe Foundation. He was also a leader in getting the food industry to make contributions to groups like the City of Hope and the University of Southern California's school of food management. === Positions held === * Corporate Vice President of Vons * President of the California Grocers Association * President of the Western Association of Food Chains * President of the Southern California Businessmen's Association * Vice president of the Supermarket Institute * Vice president of the National Association of Food Chains * Trustee of Loyola Marymount University * Regent of Santa Clara University * Director of the Food Employers Council * Member of the Archdiocese's Education Foundation * President of the Von der Ahe Foundation * Advisory board member for Providence St. Joseph Medical Center, Little Sisters of the Poor Hospital, Little Company of Mary, and St. John of God Convalescent Hospital == Philanthropy == Von der Ahe and his wife Mary Jane were well-known philanthropists in Los Angeles. Their gifts included $1 million to St. John's Seminary (California) in Camarillo to create two endowed chairs.

L.; Arnold G. P.; Storms, E. K.; Nereson, N. G. The crystal structure of Cr23C6. Acta Crystallogr. 1972, B28, 3102. ==Structure== The space group of this structure is called Fmm (in Hermann-Mauguin notation) or \\"225\\" (in the International Tables for Crystallography). It belongs to a cubic crystal system, with Pearson symbol cF116. The shortest interatomic distances are between carbon and chromium atoms, which is expected on the basis of atomic size. The carbon atoms are in positions that cap each face of the chromium cubes and their coordination environment can be thought of as distorted square antiprisms formed from chromium atoms of both the cubes and the cuboctahedra. The closest Cr-Cr contacts are between members of a cuboctahedron, and the third closest are between members of a cube. The members of the cube, however, are closer to the 8 chromium atoms in the unit cell that are not part of either polyhedron. The coordination environment of these other atoms can be thought of as distorted Friauf polyhedra composed of chromium atoms, if next-nearest neighbors are included. ==Materials== Examples of compounds that form in this structure type include Cr23C6, Mn23C6, and many ternary intermetallic carbides and borides.Stadelmaier, H.

At , it is among the largest cattle stations in Australia. ==Description== The station occupies an area of and over 25,000 Zebu cattle graze on the plains. The herd is predominantly Polled Red Brahman with 15,000 breeding females, producing 8,000 steers (males) and heifers (females) annually, most of which are exported to the Middle East and Asia. The mineral-rich grazing country includes extensive watercourse and channel country, opening onto large floodplains covered with Mitchell, Flinders, and buffel grass. The property boasts 35 new ring dams of with over of water storage. The property was estimated in value of between $1520 million (Australian dollars) in 2012. Due to the vast size of the property, R22 Beta helicopters are used to muster the animals. The Talawana Track passes through Balfour Downs, connecting it to the indigenous Australian community of Jigalong, roughly to the south and Karlamilyi National Park, roughly to the east. ==History== Babburain is the Aboriginal name for the area of . Management of the station was taken over in 1910 by Mr. A. H. Crofton, who represented the firm of Broadhurst, McNeil and Company. Crofton had previously managed Pyramid Station. The station had great rains in 1913 causing the Oakover River to run over its banks; at the time the station was co-owned by Mr. Crofton. In 1915 an Aboriginal man named Darby from the Oakover River taking in Balfour Downs Station died at Mundiwindi telegraph station and was buried at Savory Creek, leaving behind two Aboriginal children, known as the Darby sisters. In 1917 the girls were forcibly removed from Balfour Downs and placed into the care of the McDonald family of Nullagine then moved onto the Moore River Native Settlement. An Aboriginal man known as Big Bob was murdered on the station by the drover Charles Park in 1915. Park's death sentence was later commuted to five years for good behaviour and he was released in 1921. Doris Pilkington Garimara, the author of Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, was born on the station in 1937 and was forcibly removed with her mother four years later to the Moore River settlement. Neighbouring stations, such as Ethel Creek Station, were connected to Balfour Downs via the bush telephone. Balfour also had a pedal-powered wireless radio transmitter which was able to communicate as far away as Port Hedland. William Dunnett, a part owner of the station, died in 1948. He had resided in the area since 1918. Cattle from the station were often taken overland to Meekatharra then trucked to the yards at Midland junction. 13 bogies (about 600 head) of cattle were sent in 1929, 180 in 1932, 80 in 1938, another 600 cattle were dispatched in 1939, and another 700 in 1949. The lessee in 2010 was Enipend Pty. Ltd. under the management of Donald Hoar. The Hoar family owned the station from some time before 2005 to 2012. Balfour Downs is operating under the Crown Lease numbers CL110-1970 and CL136-1989 and has the Land Act numbers LA3114/977 and LA398/804. Hoar sold Balfour Downs to Xingfa Ma for approximately $18 million in 2014.

He was known as Crown Prince Zhao before his accession to the throne. ==Accession to the throne== Duke Xiao's father was Duke Huan of Qi, who was the first of the Five Hegemons, the most powerful rulers of the Spring and Autumn period. Duke Huan had at least three main wives who bore no sons, six favoured concubines, and more than ten sons. Duke Xiao was then known as Crown Prince Zhao, and his mother was Zheng Ji, a princess of the State of Zheng. Five other sons of Duke Huan also contended for the throne: Prince Wukui, Prince Pan (later Duke Zhao), Prince Shangren (later Duke Yi), Prince Yuan (later Duke Hui), and Prince Yong. When Duke Huan died in the tenth month of 643 BC, the six princes fought each other for the throne. After two months of fighting Wukui prevailed and ascended the throne in the twelfth month. Crown Prince Zhao fled to the State of Song. During the unrest Duke Huan's corpse lay unattended for 67 days, and it was so badly decomposed that worms crawled out of his room. Wukui sat on the throne for only three months before being killed. In the third month of 642 BC, Prince Zhao returned with the army of Duke Xiang of Song. The people of Qi killed Wukui and wanted to install Prince Zhao on the throne, but the supporters of the other four princes attacked and drove Prince Zhao back to the State of Song. Two months later, the Song army returned and defeated the forces of the four princes, and Prince Zhao finally ascended the throne, to be known as Duke Xiao of Qi. ==Reign== In 637 BC Duke Xiao held a conference of state leaders in order to reconfirm the hegemony of the state of Qi over the other states. However, Duke Xiang of Song refused to acknowledge Qi's hegemony as he aspired to be the hegemon himself. Duke Xiao attacked Song to punish Duke Xiang's disobedience, even though it was Duke Xiang of Song who helped him ascend the throne six years before. Duke Xiao reigned for ten years. After he died in 633 BC, Prince Kaifang (ÈñãÊñπ) of Wey, who had been a trusted official of Duke Huan, killed Duke Xiao's son and helped Prince Pan usurp the throne.

The village is part of the municipality of Putgarten. Because of its location in a coastal gully on the cliffed coast, called Liete, Vitt is not visible from afar. However, from the edge of the gully there is a view over the thatched roofs of the village. It is a popular tourist destination; often described as \\"the most romantic place on R√ºgen\\".http://www.vitt-ruegen.de/ Vitt auf R√ºgen] at www.vitt-ruegen.de.

The Marco Polo guide rates it as one of the top 15 highlights on the island of R√ºgen.Sucher, Kerstin and Wurlitzer, Bernd (2011) R√ºgen, Hiddensee, Stralsund, Marco Polo, p. 5, . == Name == The name Vitt is derived from the word Vitte(n)/Witte (German: \\"depot of a Hanseatic town where fish was processed\\"; Swedish: = \\"landing place, trading post and stockyard\\"). Actually Vitt was only a temporarily occupied Vitte from the outset where fish that had been caught were processed (c.f. Vitte). The name could however also come from Vit, a common Slavic name (for the founder of a settlement), or witt for \\"white\\" because of its white houses. Because there is no record of its foundation, the exact age of the village is unknown. According to the reports of Danish historian, Saxo Grammaticus, the village was probably already in existence by the 10th century as a fishing and trading port belonging to the Slavic Jaromarsburg on Cape Arkona. It was first mentioned in the records on 25 May 1290, when the R√ºgen prince, Witzlaw II, granted the place the right and freedom to fish. Above the village is the little Vitt Chapel, whose construction began in 1806 and was finally completed in 1816. It was built because more and more visitors came to hear the shore sermons of Altenkirchen pastor, Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, and there was no room for several of the visitors in the fishing huts during bad weather. The village, which is under heritage protection is very well preserved and receives a constant stream of tourists. In the small harbour, trips in fishing boats around Cape Arkona may be booked.

First elected in 2012, Hoylman represents the 27th District in the New York State Senate.\\"New York Elections 2012: Gillibrand, Jeffries, Meng Declare Victory As Obama Wins Reelection\\". Huffington Post, November 7, 2012. ==Background== Hoylman was born in Phoenix, Arizona and grew up in Lewisburg, West Virginia, the youngest of six children of a public school teacher and a process systems analyst. He attended West Virginia University, where he was elected president of student administration and graduated with honors. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and received a Truman Scholarship. He then attended Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship and received a master's degree in political science. Afterwards, he graduated from Harvard Law School prior to beginning his non-profit career in affordable housing. Hoylman served as general counsel for The Partnership for New York City, which represents New York City's business leadership and its largest private-sector employers. Hoylman was also the chairperson of Community Board 2 in Manhattan and the Democratic District Leader of the 66th Assembly District, Part A. He is also Trustee of the Community Service Society of New York, a former president of the Gay & Lesbian Independent Democrats, and a former board member of the Empire State Pride Agenda, Tenants & Neighbors, Class Size Matters, and Citizen Action. In 2001, Hoylman ran for the New York City Council in the first district, which includes Governor's Island and a portion of Lower Manhattan. He placed second in a seven-candidate race, losing to Alan Gerson. == New York Senate == On June 11, 2012, Hoylman declared his candidacy for the 27th District of the New York State Senate, running for the seat of retiring State Senator Tom Duane. He won Duane's endorsement, as well as the support of numerous local politicians and unions. In the Democratic primary election held on September 13, 2012, he prevailed easily, winning 70% of the vote in a three-candidate field.\\"Brad Hoylman Wins Primary to Replace State Sen. Tom Duane\\" . DNAinfo.com, September 14, 2012. Hell's Kitchen activist and bar owner Tom Greco was his closest competition, winning 24% of the vote. In the general election in November, he was unopposed. Hoylman won the Democratic primary and general election in 2014, 2016, and 2018. As of 2019, Hoylman is the only openly gay member of the New York State Senate. In December 2016, Hoylman sponsored legislation known as the Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public (T.R.U.M.P.) Act, prohibiting New York State electors from voting for a presidential candidate who has not publicly released at least 5 years worth of tax returns no later than 50 days prior to a general election. Lawmakers in 25 other states followed suit in producing legislation to compel presidential candidates to release their tax returns. A Change.org online petition in support of Hoylman's bill has since received nearly 150,000 signatures, and the idea was praised by the Editorial Board of The New York Times. After the 2018 midterm elections, Hoylman was appointed Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the majority, Hoylman passed multiple pieces of legislation including the Child Victims Act, the Gender Expression Non- Discrimination Act (or GENDA), and a ban on so-called 'gay conversion therapy.' Hoylman also passed the TRUST Act, which would allow certain Congressional committees to perform oversight by reviewing the New York State tax returns of senior government officials; members of Congress suggested this could allow Congressional committees to review Donald Trump's tax returns. City & State, a New York-based political news organization, characterized Hoylman as \\"the person behind state Senate‚Äôs progressive bills.\\" During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Hoylman was one of the only New York elected officials to stand up for the safety of prospective attorneys. He drafted a bill to permit diploma privilege and prevent recent law school graduates from having to take the bar exam in groups of 500.https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8827 ==Personal== Brad Madison Hoylman and David Ivan Sigal announced their marriage in 2013.

It soon began to manufacture reapers. The opening of the Gawler railway line in 1857 allowed Adelaide to be accessed more easily. In 1858, Thomas Flett Loutit joined the business as a shareholder and steam power was introduced to the workshop. In 1868 Loutit retired due to ill health. In the 1870s, a new foundry was built on Calton Road.James Martin & Co Phoenix Foundry Town of Gawler During this period James Martin‚Äôs nephew, John Felix Martin (1844‚Äì1916) and Fred May joined him in partnership, with the business now trading as James Martin & Co. The company moved into the production of large pumping equipment, heavy ore crushing plant and winch drums. In 1885, May left the company and founded May Brothers & Co. with his brother Alfred. By 1888 James Martin had acquired more land to the south of the foundry having secured a contract for the manufacture of 52 locomotives for the South Australian Railways This was followed two years later by a contract for a further 92 engines. Employee numbers had grown to 420 by 1888 and by the early 1890s had reached 700. On 11 April 1890, the first locomotive produced in South Australia was unveiled. The Governor of South Australia and other dignitaries were in attendance. By December 1894, the 100th locomotive had been completed. By 1898, the company had built 170 locomotives for several customers including the South Australian Railways, Tarrawingee Flux & Tramway Company and the Western Australian Government Railways. Towards the end of the 1890s, business began to decline as the South Australian Railways commenced building its own rolling stock at Islington Railway Workshops and orders for boilers ceased. James Martin died on 27 December 1899. New government contracts were secured in the first few years of the 20th century for bridges, boilers and valve castings. Increasing competition, particularly from May Brothers, together with a heavy debt burden, led to the company entering voluntary administration in August 1907. The works were divided into two separate companies. Some local farmers and businesses formed the Gawler Implement Manufacturing Co to carry on the agricultural part of the business. The major part of the former James Martin & Co. was acquired by Henry Dutton, son-in-law of John F. Martin. He took over the debts and injected capital into the engineering section and foundry, which he continued to operate under the name of James Martin & Co. The South Australian Railways awarded a contract for 10 locomotives and 100 goods wagons. This enabled the foundry to begin operations again and new contracts coming in allowed the foundry to continue working but only 250 men were employed. Another contract for 140 railway wagons was secured in May 1910 and in July of that same year the company was awarded another contract for 22 locomotives and louvred vans. Later in that same year also, the company won another contract for 21 locomotives. Henry Dutton died in 1914 but the business continued to operate and in March 1915 received orders for 12 narrow gauge boilers. On 7 April 1915, Samuel Perry purchased the foundry and set up Perry Engineering, taking over the existing contracts with production shifted to Mile End. However, Perry Engineering failed to win the large contracts required to keep the foundry viable and it closed in July 1928. Most of the buildings were demolished. The company had a siding of the broad gauge () Gawler tramway, which connected to the main railway near Gawler railway station. ==OutputBroad Gauge=== Locomotives *South Australian Railways P class ‚Äì 14 *South Australian Railways Q class ‚Äì 7 *South Australian Railways R class ‚Äì 24 *South Australian Railways S class ‚Äì 6 *South Australian Railways T class ‚Äì 34 ===Narrow Gauge=== Locomotives *Silverton Tramway Y class ‚Äì 1 *South Australian Railways Y class ‚Äì 77 *South Australian Railways V class ‚Äì 4 *South Australian Railways Z class ‚Äì 8 *Western Australian Government Railways G class ‚Äì 29 *Western Australian Government Railways / Midland Railway P class ‚Äì 2 Wagons *W class bogie wagon ==References Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of Australia Category:Defunct railway companies of Australia Category:Engineering companies of Australia Category:Locomotive manufacturers of Australia Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of Australia Category:Australian companies established in 1848 Category:1915 disestablishments in Australia Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1848 ","title":"James Martin &amp; Co"},{"id":"35868392","text":"Thaila Ayala Sales (born April 14, 1986) is a Brazilian actress and model. == Career == She began her modeling career at the age of sixteen.

Stem cell homeostasis is maintained through epigenetic mechanisms that are highly dynamic in regulating the chromatin structure as well as specific gene transcription programs. Epigenetics has been used to refer to changes in gene expression, which are heritable through modifications not affecting the DNA sequence. The mammalian epigenome undergoes global remodeling during early stem cell development that requires commitment of cells to be restricted to the desired lineage. There has been multiple evidence suggesting that the maintenance of the lineage commitment of stem cells are controlled by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and regulation of ATP-dependent remolding of chromatin structure. Based on the histone code hypothesis, distinct covalent histone modifications can lead to functionally distinct chromatin structures that influence the fate of the cell. This regulation of chromatin through epigenetic modifications is a molecular mechanism that will determine whether the cell will continue to differentiate into the desired fate. A research study performed by Lee et al. examined the effects of epigenetic modifications on the chromatin structure and the modulation of these epigenetic markers during stem cell differentiation through in vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. ==Experimental background== Embryonic stem cells exhibit dramatic and complex alterations to both global and site-specific chromatin structures. Lee et al. performed an experiment to determine the importance of deacetylation and acetylation for stem cell differentiation by looking at global acetylation and methylation levels at certain site-specific modification in histone sites H3K9 and H3K4. Gene expression at these histones regulated by epigenetic modifications is critical in restricting the embryonic stem cell to desired cell lineages and developing cellular memory. For mammalian cells, the maintenance of cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases and any disruption to these methyltransferases will cause a lethal phenotype to the embryo. Cytosine methylation is examined at H3K9, which is associated with inactive heterochromatin and occurs mainly at CpG dinucleotides while global acetylation is examined at H3K4, which is associated with active euchromatin. The mammalian zygotic genome undergoes active and passive global cytosine demethylation following fertilization that reaches a minimal point of 20% CpG methylation at the blastocyst stage to which is then followed by a wave of methylation that reprograms the chromatin structure in order to restore global levels of CpG methylation to 60%. Embryonic stem cells containing reduced or elevation levels of methylation are viable but unable to differentiate and therefore require critical regulation of cytosine methylation for mammalian development. ==Effects of global histone modifications during embryonic stem cell differentiation== Histones modifications in chromatin were analyzed at various time intervals (along a 6-day period) following the initiation of in vitro embryonic stem cell differentiation. The removal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) triggers differentiation. Representative data of the histone modifications at the specific sites after LIF removal, assessed using Western blotting, confirms strong deacetylation at the H3K4 and H3K9 positions on histone H3 after one day, followed by a small increase in acetylation by day two . The methylation of histone H3K4 also decreased after one day of LIF removal but showed a rebound between days 2‚Äì4 of differentiation, finally ending with a decrease in methylation on day five. These results indicate a decrease in the level of active euchromatin epigenetic marks upon initiation of embryonic stem cell differentiation which is then followed immediately by reprogramming of the epigenome. Histone modifications of H3K9 position show a decrease in di- and tri-methylation of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and had a gradual increase in methylation during the six-day time course of in vitro differentiation, which indicated that there is a global increase of inactive heterochromatin levels at this histone mark. As the embryonic stem cell undergoes differentiation the markers for active euchromatin (histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation) are decreased after the removal of LIF showing that the cell is indeed becoming more differentiated. The slight rebound in each of these marks allows for further differentiation to occur by allowing another opportunity to decrease the markers once again, bringing the cell closer to its mature state. Since there is also an increase throughout the six-day period in H3K9me, a marker for active heterochromatin, once differentiation occurs it is concluded that the formation of heterochromatin occurs as the cell is differentiated into its desired fate making the cell inactive to prevent further differentiation. ===DNA methylation in differentiated versus undifferentiated cells=== Global levels of 5-methylcytosine were compared between undifferentiated and differentiated embryonic stem cells in vitro. The global cytosine methylation pattern appears to be established prior to the reprogramming of the histone code that occurs upon in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells. As the embryonic stem cell undergoes differentiation the level of DNA methylation increases. This indicates that there is an increase in inactive heterochromatin during differentiation. ==Supplemental effects of methylation with DNMTs== In mammals, DNA methylation plays a role in regulating a key component of multipotency‚Äîthe ability to rapidly self-renew. Khavari et al. discussed the fundamental mechanisms of DNA methylation and the interaction with several pathways regulating differentiation. New approaches studying the genomic status of DNA methylation in various states of differentiation have shown that methylation at CpG sites associated with putative enhancers are important in this process. DNA methylation can modulate the binding affinities of transcription factors by recruiting repressors such as MeCP2 which display binding specificity for sequences containing methylated CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is controlled by certain methyltransferases, DMNTs, which perform different functions depending on each one. DNMT3A and DNMT3B have both been linked to a role in the establishment of DNA methylation pattern in the early development of the stem cell, whereas DNMT1 is required to methylate a newly synthesized strand of DNA after the cell has undergone replication in order to sustain the epigenetic regulatory state. Numerous proteins can physically interact with DNMTs themselves, which help target DNMT1 to hemi-methylated DNA. Several new studies point to the central role of DNA methylation interacting with the regulation of cell cycles and DNA repair pathways in order to maintain the undifferentiated state. In embryonic stem cells, DNMT1 depletion within the undifferentiated progenitor cell compartment led to cell cycle arrest, premature differentiation and a failure of tissue self-renewal. The loss of DNMT1 occurred from profound effects associated with activation of differentiation genes and loss of genes promoting cell cycle progression, thus indicating that DNMT1 and other DNMTs do not continuously suppress differentiation and thus maintain the pluripotent state. These studies point to the importance of the interaction of DNMTs in order to maintain stem cell states allowing for further differentiation and formation of heterochromatin to occur. ==Epigenetic modifications of regulated genes during ESC differentiation== Okamoto et al. previously documented the expression level of the Oct4 gene decreasing with embryonic stem cell differentiation. Lee et al. performed a ChIP analysis of the Oct4 promoter, associated with undifferentiated cells, region to examine the epigenetic modifications of regulated genes undergoing development during embryonic stem cell differentiation. This promoter region decreased at H3K4 methylation and H3K9 acetylation sites and increased at the H3K9 methylation site during differentiation. Analysis of a CpG motif of the Oct4 gene promoter revealed a progressive increase of DNA methylation and was completely methylated at day 10 of differentiation as previously reported in Gidekel and Bergman. These results indicate that there was a shift from the active eurchromatin to the inactive heterochromatin due to the decrease of acetylation of H3K4 and an increase of H3K9me. This means that the cell is becoming differentiated at the Oct4 gene, which is coincident with the silence of Oct4 gene expression. Another site specific gene tested for histone modification was a Brachyury gene, a marker of mesoderm differentiation and is only slightly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. \\"Brachyury\\" was induced at day five of differentiation and completely silencing by day 10, corresponding to the last day of differentiation. The ChIP analysis of the \\"Brachyury\\" gene promoter revealed increase of expression in mono- and di-methylation of H3K4 at day 0 and 5 of embryonic stem cell differentiation with a loss of gene expression at day 10. H3K4 trimethylation coincides with the time of highest Brachyury gene expression since it only had gene expression on day 5. H3K4 methylations in all forms are absent at day 10 of differentiation, which correlates with the silencing of Brachyury gene expression. Mono-methylation of both histones produced expression at day 0 indication a marker that is not useful for chromatin structure. Acetlyation of H3K9 does not correlate to Brachyury gene expression since it was down regulated at the induction of differentiation. Upon examining of DNA methylation expression, there was no formation of intermediate sized bad in the Southern analysis suggesting that CpG motifs upstream of the promoter region are not methylated in the absence of cytosine methylation at this site. It is demonstrated from these studies that both H3K9 di-and tri-methylation correlate with the DNA methylation and gene expression while H3K4 tri-methylation is associated the highest gene expression stage of the Brachyury gene. A previous report from Santos-Rosa is in agreement with these data showing that active genes are associated with H3K4 tri-methylation in yeast. This data indicated the same results as for the Oct4 gene, in that heterochromatin is forming as differentiation occurs again coinciding with the silence of Brachyury gene expression. ==Effect of TSA on stem cell differentiation== Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was removed from all the cell lines. LIF inhibits cell differentiation, and its removal allows the cell lines to go through cell differentiation. The cell lines were treated with Trichostatin A (TSA) - a histone deacetylase inhibitor for 6 days. One group of cell lines was treated with 10nM of TSA. The western analysis showed the lack of initial deacetylation on Day-1 which, was observed in the control for the embryonic stem cell differentiation. The lack of histone deacetylase activity allowed the acetylation of H3K9 and histone H4. Embryonic stem cells were also analyzed morphologically to observe the formation of embryoid body formation as one of the measures of cell differentiation. The 10nM TSA treated cells failed to form the embryoid body by Day-6 as observed in the control cell line. This implies that the ES cells treated with TSA lacked the deacetylation on Day-1 and failed to differentiate after the removal of LIF. Second group,‚Äô-TSA Day4‚Äô was treated with TSA for 3days. As soon as the TSA treatment was stopped, on day 4 the deacetylation was observed and the acetylation recovered on Day-5. The morphological examination showed the formation of embryoid body formation by Day-6. In addition, the embryoid body formation was faster than the control cell line. This suggests that the ‚Äò-TSA Day4‚Äô lines were responding to the removal of LIF but, were unable to acquire any differentiation phenotype. They were able to acquire the differentiation phenotype after the cessation of TSA treatment and at rapid rate. The morphological examination of the third group,‚Äô 5 nM TSA‚Äô showed the intermediate effect between the control and 10nM-TSA group. The lower dose of TSA allowed the formation of some embryoid body formation. This experiment shows that TSA inhibits histone deacetylase and the activity of histone deacetylase is required for the embryonic stem cell differentiation. Without the initial deacetylation on Day-1, the ES cells cannot go through the differentiation. ==Alkaline phosphatase activity== Alkaline phosphatases found in humans are membrane bound glycoproteins, which function to catalyze the hydrolysis of monophosphate esters. McKenna et al. (1979) found that there are at least three varieties of alkaline phosphatases, kidney, liver, and bone alkaline phosphatases, that are all coded by the same structural gene, but contain non-identical carbohydrate moieties. The alkaline phosphatase varieties, therefore, express a unique complement of in the enzymatic processes in post-translational glycosylation of proteins. In normal stem cells, the activity of alkaline phosphatase activity is lowered upon differentiation. Trichostatin A causes the cells to maintain the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Trichostatin A can cause reversible inhibition of mammalian histone deacetylase, which leads to the inhibition of cell growth Significant increase in alkaline phosphatase extinction was observed when Trichostatin A was withdrawn after three days. Alkaline phosphatase activity correlates with the morphology changes. Initial deacetylation of histone is required for embryonic stem cell differentiation. ==HDAC1, but not HDAC2 controls differentiation== Dovery et al. (2010) used HDAC knockout mice to demonstrate whether HDAC1 or HDAC2 was important for the embryonic stem cell differentiation. Examination of global histone acetylation in the absence of HDAC 1 showed an increase in acetylation. Global histone acetylation levels were unchanged by the loss of HDAC2. In order to analyze the process of HDAC knockout mouse in detail, the knockout mice embryonic stem cells were used to generate embryoid bodies. It showed that just before or during gastrulation, embryonic stem cells lacking HDAC1 acquired visible developmental defects. The continued culture of HDAC1 knockout embryonic stem cells showed that the embryoid bodies formed became irregular and reduced in size rather than uniformly spherical as in normal mice. Embryonic stem cell proliferation was unaffected by the loss of either HDAC1 or HDAC2 but the differentiation of embryonic stem cells were affected with that lack of HDAC 1. This shows that HDAC1 is required for cell fate determination during differentiation. ==The future== Any disturbance of a stable epigenetic regulation of gene expression mediated by DNA methylation is associated with a number of human disorders, including cancer as well as congenital diseases such as pseudohypoparathyroidism type IA, Beckwith-Wiedemann, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, which are each caused by altered methylation-based imprinting at specific loci. Perturbations of both global and gene-specific patterns of cytosine methylation are commonly observed in cancer while histone deacetylation is an important feature of nuclear reprogramming in oocytes during meiosis. Recent studies have revealed that there is an array of different pathways that cooperates with one another in order to bestow proper epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation. Future studies will be needed to further clarify the certain mechanism pathways such as DNA binding proteins, DNA repair and noncoding RNAs serve in order to regulate DNA methylation to suppress differentiation and sustain self-renewal in somatic stem cells in the epidermis and other tissues. Addressing these questions will help extend insight into these recent findings for a central role in epigenetic regulators of DNA methylation in controlling embryonic stem cell differentiation. ==References== Category:Epigenetics Category:Induced stem cells ","title":"Epigenetics in stem-cell differentiation"},{"id":"35868492","text":"Kasalanan Bang Ibigin Ka?

The final was played between √âtoile du Sahel from Tunisia and Al-Ahly from Egypt. After a goal-less first leg, EsS Sahel won the second leg 3‚Äì1 in Cairo to win their first African title . As a result, ES Sahel qualified to enter the quarterfinals of the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup as the CAF representative, as well as participate in the 2008 CAF Super Cup against the winner of the 2007 CAF Confederation Cup. ==Qualified teams== In the following table, finals until 1996 were in the African Cup of Champions Club era, since 1997 were in the CAF Champions League era. {  - !Team !Region !Previous finals appearances (bold indicates winners) -  √âtoile du Sahel UNAF (North Africa) 2004, 2005 -  Al Ahly UNAF (North Africa) 1982, 1983, 1987, 2001, 2005, 2006 } ==Background== Both teams had met in the same round in 2005 when the Egyptian team won (3-0) in Cairo. Al-Ahly were the defending champions, and also the most successful club in the African Champions Cup/CAF Champions League with Zamalek, reaching a total of six finals, winning five (1982, 1987, 2001, 2005, 2006) and losing one (1983). √âtoile du Sahel reached the final twice but they lost against Enyimba in 2004 and against Al Ahly in 2005. Both teams qualified as winners of their groups. Both teams qualified for the semifinals on the second-last matchday. In the semifinals √âtoile du Sahel defeated the Sudanese side Al Hilal 3‚Äì2 on aggregate, losing the first leg in Omdurman (1-2), with the second leg ending in a win (3-1). Al Ahly faced Al Iittihad from Libya and draw the first leg (0-0) away from home. In need of a win in the second leg, Al Ahly were victorious 1‚Äì0 and reached the final to face √âtoile du Sahel again after 2 years. ==VenuesStade Olympique de Sousse=== Stade Olympique in Sousse, Tunisia hosted the first leg. Stade olympique de Sousse is a multi-purpose stadium in Sousse, Tunisia. It is used by the football team √âtoile du Sahel, and was used for the 2004 African Cup of Nations. The stadium holds 28,000 people. It hosts within it the meetings played by the football team of the city: √âtoile sportive du Sahel (ESS). For many decades, Sousse footballers knew only the clay surfaces and knew the turf surfaces only when the stadium was inaugurated with an initial capacity of 10,000 places. It passes over the years to 15,000 seats and is then expanded again on the occasion of the 1994 African Cup of Nations with 6,000 additional seats to reach a capacity of 21,000 seats; A luminous panel is installed at the same time. The last expansion was carried out in 1999 to bring the capacity of the stadium to 28,000 seats for the 2001 Mediterranean Games, a reorganization of the gallery of honor was carried out, from a capacity of 70 to 217 places. It hosted 1977 FIFA World Youth Championship, 1994 African Cup of Nations, 2001 Mediterranean Games and 2004 African Cup of Nations. ===Cairo International Stadium=== International Stadium in Cairo, Egypt hosted the second leg. Cairo International Stadium, formerly known as Nasser Stadium, is an Olympic- standard, multi-use stadium with an all-seated capacity of 75,000. The architect of the stadium is the German Werner March, who had built from 1934 to 1936 the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Before becoming an all seater stadium, it had the ability to hold over 100,000 spectators, reaching a record of 120,000. It is the foremost Olympic-standard facility befitting the role of Cairo, Egypt as the center of events in the region. It is also the 69th largest stadium in the world. Located in Nasr City; a suburb north east of Cairo, it was completed in 1960, and was inaugurated by President Gamal Abd El Nasser on 23 July that year, the eighth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Zamalek SC currently use the Petro Sport Stadium for most of their home games and Al Ahly use Al Salam Stadium for most of their home games. The Stadium is located about 10 km west of Cairo International Airport and about 10 km (30 min) from downtown Cairo. In 2005, in preparation for the 2006 African Cup of Nations it underwent a major renovation, and was brought up to 21st century world standard along with all its multi-game Olympic facilities which did not enable the same two teams to play the 2005 final on this stadium. ==Road to final== { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !colspan=4 √âtoile du Sahel !Round !colspan=4 Al-Ahly -bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg Qualifying rounds Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg - align=left Fello Star 5‚Äì1 1‚Äì0 (A) 4‚Äì1 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffFirst round align=left Highlanders 2‚Äì0 0‚Äì0 (A) 2‚Äì0 (H) - align=left Maranatha 3‚Äì0 0‚Äì0 (A) 3‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffSecond round align=left Mamelodi Sundowns 4‚Äì2 2‚Äì2 (A) 2‚Äì0 (H) - -bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent colspan=3Result Group stage Opponent colspan=3Result - align=left FAR Rabat colspan=31‚Äì0 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 1 align=left Al-Hilal colspan=32‚Äì0 (H) - align=left Al-Ittihad colspan=30‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 2 align=left ASEC Mimosas colspan=31‚Äì0 (A) - align=left JS Kabylie colspan=33‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 3 align=left Esp√©rance de Tunis colspan=33‚Äì0 (H) - align=left JS Kabylie colspan=32‚Äì0 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 4 align=left Esp√©rance de Tunis colspan=30‚Äì1 (A) - align=left FAR Rabat colspan=30‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 5 align=left Al-Hilal colspan=30‚Äì3 (A) - align=left Al-Ittihad colspan=30‚Äì2 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 6 align=left ASEC Mimosas colspan=32‚Äì0 (H) - colspan=4 align=center valign=top bgcolor=#c1e0ffFinal standings colspan=4 align=center valign=top -bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg Knock-out stage Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg - align=left Al Hilal 5‚Äì4 1‚Äì2 (A) 3‚Äì1 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffSemifinals align=left Al Ittihad 1‚Äì0 0‚Äì0 (A) 1‚Äì0 (H) } ==Format== The final was decided over two legs, with aggregate goals used to determine the winner.

In the second leg, Al Ahly lost 1‚Äì2 but reached the final. ==VenuesCairo International Stadium=== International Stadium in Cairo, Egypt hosted the first leg. Cairo International Stadium, formerly known as Nasser Stadium, is an Olympic-standard, multi-use stadium with an all-seated capacity of 75,000. The architect of the stadium is the German Werner March, who had built from 1934 to 1936 the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Before becoming an all seater stadium, it had the ability to hold over 100,000 spectators, reaching a record of 120,000. It is the foremost Olympic-standard facility befitting the role of Cairo, Egypt as the center of events in the region. It is also the 69th largest stadium in the world. Located in Nasr City; a suburb north east of Cairo, it was completed in 1960, and was inaugurated by President Gamal Abd El Nasser on 23 July that year, the eighth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Zamalek SC currently use the Petro Sport Stadium for most of their home games and Al Ahly use Al Salam Stadium for most of their home games. ===7 November Stadium=== 7 November Stadium in Rad√®s, Tunisia hosted the second leg. 7 November Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Rad√®s, Tunisia about 10 kilometers south-east of the city center of Tunis, in the center of the Olympic City. It is currently used mostly for football matches and it also has facilities for athletics. The stadium holds 60,000 and was built in 2001 for the 2001 Mediterranean Games and is considered to be one of the best stadiums in Africa. The stadium was built for the 2001 Mediterranean Games, the 60,000-seat covered area covers 13,000 m2 and consists of a central area, 3 adjoining grounds, 2 warm-up rooms, 2 paintings and an official stand of 7,000 seats. The press gallery is equipped with 300 desks. Club Africain and ES Tunis play their major league matches here. Before the construction of this stadium, the Tunis derby used to be played in the 45,000 seat-capacity Stade El Menzah. It is also the stadium of Tunisia national football team since 2001. This stadium has hosted matches of the 2004 African Cup of Nations which was won by the Tunisian team. The management of CS Sfaxien confirmed that it was necessary to transfer the match from the Stade Ta√Øeb Mhiri in Sfax, which was held by all the matches of the team in the African competition this season to the Rad√®s Stadium, because the capacity of the Rad√®s Stadium is 60,000 spectators, while the capacity of the Stade Ta√Øeb Mhiri does not exceed 20,000, which is what confirms the organization of the match on the field of the stadium of Sfax was difficult. == Road to the final == Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !colspan=4 Al-Ahly !Round !colspan=4 CS Sfaxien -bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg Qualifying rounds Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg - colspan=4Bye bgcolor=#c1e0ffPreliminary round align=left AS-FNIS 7‚Äì1 3‚Äì1 (A) 4‚Äì0 (H) - align=left Tusker FC 5‚Äì0 2‚Äì0 (A) 3‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffFirst round align=left DC Motema Pembe 2‚Äì1 1‚Äì1 (H) 1‚Äì0 (A) - align=left Renacimiento FC 4‚Äì0 0‚Äì0 (A) 4‚Äì0 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffSecond round align=left FAR Rabat 2‚Äì1 1‚Äì1 (H) 1‚Äì0 (A) -bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent colspan=3Result Group stage Opponent colspan=3Result - align=left CS Sfaxien colspan=30‚Äì1 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 1 align=left Al-Ahly colspan=31‚Äì0 (H) - align=left JS Kabylie colspan=32‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 2 align=left Asante Kotoko colspan=32‚Äì4 (A) - align=left Asante Kotoko colspan=30‚Äì0 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 3 align=left JS Kabylie colspan=31‚Äì0 (A) - align=left Asante Kotoko colspan=34‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 4 align=left JS Kabylie colspan=32‚Äì0 (H) - align=left CS Sfaxien colspan=32‚Äì1 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 5 align=left Al-Ahly colspan=31‚Äì2 (A) - align=left JS Kabylie colspan=32‚Äì2 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 6 align=left Asante Kotoko colspan=32‚Äì1 (H) - colspan=4 align=center valign=topGroup A runner-up bgcolor=#c1e0ffFinal standings colspan=4 align=center valign=topGroup A winner -bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg Knock-out stage Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg - align=left ASEC Mimosas 3-2 2‚Äì0 (H) 1‚Äì2 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffSemifinals align=left Orlando Pirates 1-0 0‚Äì0 (A) 0‚Äì1 (H) } \\\\---- ==Format== The final was decided over two legs, with aggregate goals used to determine the winner.

The Basilica di San Vincenzo is a church in Galliano, a frazione of Cant√π, in Lombardy, northern Italy. An example of local Romanesque architecture, it was founded in 1007. The complex includes also a baptistry, dedicated to St. John the Baptist. ==History== Aribert of Milan offering the model of the church. Fresco in the apse. The church is located in Galliano, a small hamlet included within the comune of Cant√π. The toponym derives from the ancient people of the Gallianates, whose name is mentioned in a Roman altar dedicated to Matronis Braecorium Gallianatium Starting from the 2nd century, the worship of ancient gods such as Jupiter, Minerva and the Capitoline Triad was replaced by the Christian religion, in particular during the evangelization effort of Ambrose in the late 4th century. In the 5th century a Palaeo-Christian basilica, acting as the pieve of Cant√π, existed in the site, perhaps with a baptstry. Of this structure, the black and white marble pavement remains in the current edifice's presbytery. The current church was begun in the 10th century. The basilica was re- consecrated by Aribert, archbishop of Milan, who at the time was likely the hereditary tenant of the edifice: this is testified by the presence of graffitoes under the apse's frescoes, which mention the death of his father, brother and nephew. The church was nearly ruined at the time of archbishop Charles Borromeo (1560‚Äì1584). Later it was abandoned and used as peasants' store and lost the small right aisle in a fire. Other sections went lost during the French occupation in the early 19th century, when they were considered of no artistic interest and sold to private collectors. The basilica was acquired by the comune of Cant√π in 1909 and restored in 1933‚Äì1934. Plan of the basilica in its current state. ==Description== The church has a simple and undecorated fa√ßade, in rough cobblestones. In the center is a portal with an architrave and an ogival lunette. The apse protrudes substantially from the main body. It features an archaic type of Lombard bands, with isolated arches characterized by pilasters that connect them to the ground. There are three windows which give light to the crypt: these are slightly different from those of the nave, due to the presence of a slight internal slope. The only remaining side apse is partly visible at the right. The crypt, and subsequently the presbytery, are more elevated than in other Romanesque buildings. The crypt has two halls with cross vaults, above which, originally, were two ambons: today only part of the left one remains, with a marble eagle which once supported the lectern. The church is known for the frescoes which cover the nave's walls and the apse. The latter are likely earlier than the former, as testified by the different style.* The apse frescoes show two bands of pictures with animals and vegetable motifs. They are surmounted by a praying Jesus within an almond frame. Jesus is wearing sandals, an uncommon feature of such depictions. He is flanked by two old men, the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, behind whom are the two archangels Michael and Gabriel and two crowds. The lower walls of the apse show a short cycle of stories of St Vincent of Saragossa. The fourth panel features St Aribert offering a model of the church to God: the upper part of this scene is now at the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana of Milan. The Baptistry of St. John. Next to the church is the contemporary Baptistry of St John, which was built at the same time. Its plan is inspired by that of the 9th century Santa Maria presso San Satiro in Milan, although in a simplified form: a cruciform shape with a square hall limited by four isolated columns and four perpendicular arches, and four semicircular niches. The western niche opens to the interior, from which stairs lead to the matronei (tribunes in the upper floor), which are not present in San Satiro. The interior ends with a dome, externally covered by an octagonal drum with four windows and small arches. ==ReferencesSources== * Category:Romanesque architecture in Lombardy Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1107 Vincenzo Category:12th-century Roman Catholic church buildings ","title":"Basilica di San Vincenzo"},{"id":"35868554","text":"Mordellistena dahomeyana is a beetle in the genus Mordellistena of the family Mordellidae.

Khusraw composed most of his poems in the Valley of Yumgan, a remote mountainous region in Badakhshan (in present-day Afghanistan). The Divan contains around 11,000 verses of Khusraw's own poetry, reflecting philosophical, religious, and personal themes.Institute of Ismaili Studies ==Poetry== The majority of poems contained in the Diwan are odes composed in the traditional Persian qasida (a structured form of poetry with an elaborate metre). The qasida consists of a single rhyme carried throughout the entirety of the poem. In terms of rhythm, each line (bayt) of the qasida consists of two equal parts. The Divan also contains quatrains and shorter poems (as qasidas can be relatively long). Khusraw, in his Divan, employs sophisticated rhetorical and poetic devices characteristic of Persian poetry. Su‚Äôal u javab, or question and answer, is used frequently. Antanaclasis is also employed, often with words that denote both places and things. In her book, Make A Shield From Wisdom : Selected Verses from Nasir-i Khusraw's Divan, Annemarie Schimmel gives the example of the play on Sham meaning Syria, and sham denoting the 'evening', that occurs throughout the Divan. The combination of prescribed structure and varied peotic devices adds to the elegance and sophistication of his poetry, making this collection one of the greatest in Persian literature. ==Content== Unlike the poetry of the traditional Persian court poets, for which Khusraw shows distaste in the Divan (refer to Divan 97 cf. 436), Khusraw's poetry explores topics encompassing (but not limited to) philosophy, particularly ethics and metaphysics, religion, the pursuit of knowledge, faith and reasoning, and the natural world. The framework and underlying theme of his Divan is religious in nature. Schimmel points out that even Khusraw's outward descriptions of nature are linked to the Creator and to the Qur'an. Throughout the poems, Khusraw exhorts that an esoteric interpretation of the Qur'an is important, as are the exoteric rituals and practices. There are also instances of historical commentary and personal emotion, longing, and expression present in his poetry (Divan 65:18-20; Khusraw comments on the conquest of Khurasan by the Seljuqs.) In particular, Nasir Khusraw dedicates long verses to the Ismaili Caliph-Imam al-Mustansir who ruled over the Fatimid Caliphate at the time. The Divan continues to be analyzed for its historical, philosophical, and literary merit.The Philosophical Poetry of Nasir Khusraw ==Controversy== There has been a long-standing debate regarding the authorship of the Sa'adat-nama (The Book of Happiness), published in the 1925-1928 edition of the Divan. Under the collaboration of scholars in the early twentieth century, it was added to the aforementioned edition. Some argue, however, that the extensive poem was in fact written by a man with the same name: Nasir Khusraw-i Isfahani. Malik al- Shu'ara Bahar states this in his Sabk ShenƒÅsi (Methodology). ==References== *Institute of Ismaili Studies * * ==See also== *Safarnama *Persian Literature Category:Persian literature Category:Afghan literature ","title":"Diwan (Nasir Khusraw)"},{"id":"35868556","text":"A by-election was held for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Werriwa on 23 September 1978.

It was described in 1970 by Ermisch. ==References== fallaciosa Category:Beetles described in 1970 ","title":"Mordellistena fallaciosa"},{"id":"35868775","text":"The Spear is a painting by Cape Town-based South African artist, Brett Murray. It depicts former South African President Jacob Zuma in a pose reminiscent of Lenin, with his genitals exposed. The painting triggered a defamation lawsuit by Zuma's party, the African National Congress (ANC), and was vandalised on 22 May 2012. == Exhibition == Prior to its being vandalised, The Spear was shown at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg, South Africa. The painting featured as one of the pieces of artist Brett Murray's Hail to the Thief II exhibition, which commenced on 10 May 2012. Inspiration is understood to have been drawn from the Viktor Semyonovich Ivanov's poster Lenin Lived, Lenin is Alive, Lenin Will Live. The exhibition features various pieces that are critical of South Africa's ruling party, the ANC, showcasing sculptures and images that suggest corruption and bad governance. Murray's works in the exhibition also include modifying ANC liberation struggle posters and flyers from the Apartheid era, some displaying the text \\"Amandla, we demand Chivas, BMWs and bribes\\". == Public perception of Jacob Zuma == Zuma has often been the centre of scandal and ridicule, due to his polygamous lifestyle with many wives and girlfriends, and a comment he made during his 2006 rape trial that showering after sex would minimise the risk of contracting HIV. His lifestyle has made him the target of well-known cartoonist Zapiro, who frequently depicts Zuma with a shower on his head, ridiculing the statements he made during his trial. Zapiro was also sued for defamation by the ANC, with a hearing expected in October 2012. These public perceptions of Zuma provided part of the basis for Brett Murray's painting. Zapiro added fuel to the fire by doing his own version of the painting, replacing the genitals with a showerhead. Another appeared two days later, ridiculing Zuma. == ANC response == Owner and director of the Goodman Gallery, Liza Essers, said that she received a telephone call on Sunday, 13 May 2012 from special advisor to the minister of arts and culture Mduduzi Mbata seeking to clarify her thoughts on the exhibition, after it had been reviewed in the newspaper City Press, along with a photograph of The Spear. During the brief conversation she invited him to visit the gallery the following Tuesday, but he never kept the appointment. The ANC issued a press release on 17 May 2012 expressing outrage about the painting and their intention to apply to the High Court to have it removed, this being reiterated by attorneys representing the ANC and Jacob Zuma in an email sent to Essers the same day. The painting drew strong condemnation from ANC rulers and various religious groups, who found the painting 'obscene' and 'vulgar'. A leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church called for the artist to be stoned to death. The ANC also demanded that the image be taken down from the City Press' website. ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said of the painting, \\"The African National Congress is extremely disturbed and outraged by the distasteful and indecent manner in which Brett Murray and the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg is displaying the person of comrade President Jacob Zuma\\". Zuma responded to the artwork by saying that it painted him as \\"a philanderer and a womaniser\\". In response to the impending legal action, gallery spokesperson Lara Koseff said its lawyers had responded that it would stay until the show was over, citing censorship concerns as central to the decision to allow the exhibition to continue. The ANC Women's League has also demanded that the exhibition be halted, and all instances of the image be removed from the internet. Brett Murray said that his painting had not been intended maliciously, but as \\"an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse\\". In the first day of legal proceedings, the representative for the ANC, Gcina Malindi, began sobbing and was unable to proceed, causing the process to be adjourned and postponed and the television coverage of the event was suppressed. Later, the ANC sought to drop proceedings. === Consequences === The ANC's public condemnation of the painting brought widespread local and international attention to the painting, where otherwise it may have remained a relatively obscure piece of work. For this reason, the action and subsequent fall-out has been characterised as an example of the Streisand effect. Subsequently, The Spear has been featured in editorials and news features in all forms of traditional and digital media. Former ANC leader Oliver Tambo‚Äôs daughter Tselane Tambo was of the opinion that Zuma deserved Murray‚Äôs portrayal of him. She wrote on a social networking site, ‚ÄúDo the poor enjoy poverty? Do the unemployed enjoy hopelessness? Do those who can‚Äôt get housing enjoy homelessness? He must get over it. No one is having a good time. He should inspire the reverence he craves. This portrait is what he inspired. Shame neh!‚Äù. The media boycott of City Press by the ANC and various public figures led to the newspaper eventually removing the painting from its website on 28 May 2012. The paper's editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee cited several reasons for this decision, including violent threats made to her team by those supporting the boycott. === Media boycott === After City Press repeatedly refused to remove an image of the painting off their website, the ANC called upon its members and sympathisers to boycott placing advertising in, and buying of, the weekly paper. A statement released by the ANC said: \\"Their refusal to remove this portrait from their website and their controlled social media is a clear indication that this newspaper does not belong to our shared democratic dispensation and values.\\" Responding to the boycott, City Press editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee described Nzimande's call for a boycott of the paper as \\"deeply disturbing\\". The ANC was criticised by the South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF), which said \\"While we recognise the right of the ANC to advise members on how to exercise their consumer decisions, the call for a boycott of a newspaper is tantamount to intimidation and abuse of power ... This kind of behaviour is unbecoming of a party that functions in an open democratic stage and especially one which leads the national government.\\" The boycott of City Press was further condemned by the International Press Institute (IPI),South African newspaper defies ANC boycott call and by 28 May, ten days after the newspaper printed the painting for the first time, opinions in the ANC had divided with several senior members opposing the boycott. == Defacement == On the morning of 22 May 2012, two men entered the gallery during visiting hours, and defaced the painting - first by painting a red cross over the depiction of Zuma's face and genitals, and then by smearing black paint over the canvas. The two men ‚Äî Barend la Grange and Lowie Mabokela ‚Äî were arrested by security officials. This defacement took place whilst court proceedings brought on by the ANC around the right to censor the image were underway. The way in which the two men were arrested also drew criticism: Barend la Grange was arrested without any apparent violence, while Lowie Mabokela was head-butted and thrown to the ground. == Classification == On 22 May 2012, the Film and Publication Board (FPB) of South Africa announced that a team of five classifiers had been sent to assess The Spear, following specific complaints to the FPB, which is the statutory body responsible for classifying, and applying age ratings and content advisories to, works published or distributed in South Africa, including films, computer games, images of all kinds, and printed publications; however, \\"Only pornographic publications need to be passed by the FPB before they are released on the market\\" while others are considered based on \\"complaints received from the public regarding specific publications\\", and the FPB's jurisdiction specifically excludes newspapers and the broadcast media, which are regulated by separate entities. For this reason, the FPB proceedings could only consider the painting itself, its display by the gallery, and its publication or possible publication on websites or in other venues subject to FPB jurisdiction; and could not address the publication of images of it by newspapers or broadcasters. During the classification proceedings, there were allegations that the FPB was acting outside its statutory remit, and that specific members had made statements or asked questions implying that it was entitled to censor political opinions and restrict freedom of the press. On 1 June 2012, the FPB announced that the classifiers assigned to 'The Spear' had rejected a complainant's call for the painting to be rated X18 (placing it within the category of legal pornographic works that must \\"be passed by the FPB before they are released on the market\\", and that may be distributed only by licensed distributors, who are required to obtain proof of age), but had decided on a 16N rating for the original, undefaced and uncensored, painting, meaning that measures should be put in place to prevent access to it and to images of it by those under the age of sixteen, and to advise \\"sensitive adult viewers\\" over sixteen that it contains nudity (but not explicit sexual content, which would have been designated by an S in the rating). In its press statement announcing the classification, the FPB referred at length to its statutory authority and responsibilities, in particular its role in \\"promoting the safety of children\\"; and explicitly denied that it had been influenced by political figures or had acted beyond its jurisdiction, saying that \\"We believe that reports to the contrary have been specifically designed to defame the Film and Publication Board, question its integrity, competence, credibility as well as formulate as a reality the false notion that the state seeks to silence and censor the media by all means possible and with total disregard for accepted procedures and principles\\". In reply to questions, FPB chief operations officer Mmapula Fisha said that The Spear differed from other works of art containing nudity, and merited the 16N classification, because \\"The artwork has forced society to revisit its painful history\\". After the classification was announced, the Goodman Gallery was reported to be seeking legal advice, but to have said they \\"felt it would have a significant impact on freedom of artistic expression\\", a criticism also made by commentators not involved in the case, while others expressed concern about political censorship. The full report of the classification committee responsible for assessing The Spear was subsequently made available online. The classification was open to appeal. On 10 July 2012, the Goodman Gallery announced that it would be appealing the classification decision, and the following day the FPB confirmed that an appeal had been lodged. On 13 September 2012, the Goodman Gallery made written submissions to the Film and Publication Appeal Tribunal, and its written arguments were also made available to the press. The tribunal heard oral argument and evidence on 17 September 2012. On 10 October 2012, the FPB announced that the Film and Publication Appeal Tribunal had upheld the Goodman Gallery's appeal, setting aside the classification and thereby removing all restrictions on publication of and access to the painting. The tribunal's full ruling was published on the same day. The Appeal Tribunal approved the original Classification Committee's determination that The Spear should not be classed as pornography, but found against the committee, its procedure, and its classification on several grounds, including that the decision had been based on flawed arguments and interpretation of the relevant law; that the committee had relied on conclusions for which no evidence had been presented either during the original classification process or to the Appeal Tribunal; that the FPB should not have considered a complaint against the publication of The Spear in newspapers or on their websites, because the FPB has no jurisdiction over such publications, and should instead have passed complaints against them on to the appropriate regulator; that the committee had wrongly taken upon itself \\"responsibility for balancing conflicting rights\\" that properly belonged to the courts, and was beyond the \\"much narrower mandate [of] the Classification Committee\\"; that the FPB had wrongly, and in violation both of the rights of their publishers and of legal principles of procedural fairness, \\"appeared to extend its ruling to all websites that contained electronic replications of the painting and to all other publications of the painting\\", rather than restricting its decision to the specific named respondents who had been accorded an opportunity to make representations during the classification process; that due weight had not been given to the painting's status as a work of agreed artistic merit enjoying greater statutory protection from both publication and age restrictions; that the committee had wrongly deemed nudity per se to be grounds for considering a work of art \\"potentially disturbing, harmful, or inappropriate to children\\"; and that the committee had used the system of \\"restrictive age classifications\\" designed solely to \\"protect children\\" (and not adults) from potentially \\"disturbing, harmful, or age- inappropriate material\\" and \\"from premature exposure to adult experiences\\" in a way that \\"was not legally permissible\\" for \\"the purposes of protecting sensitive viewers or assuaging the sense of indignity felt by some segments of the community\\" by effectively restricting adults' access to a published work that was neither illegal nor pornographic. ==Comparisons== The Spear portrait has invited comparison to other satirical pieces, including fellow South African artist Ayanda Mabulu's work, ' (Zulu: \\"Better poor than a rich puppet\\"), which depicts various regional and international political figures - including Jacob Zuma - in the nude. The painting received additional attention following the media focus on controversial satirical artworks. == References  See also == *Mirth & Girth Category:South African art Category:2010 paintings Category:Jacob Zuma Category:Political art Category:Controversies in South Africa Category:Vandalized works of art Category:Censorship in the arts Category:Portraits of politicians Category:Portraits of men Category:Black people in art Category:Cultural depictions of politicians Category:Cultural depictions of South African men ","title":"The Spear (painting)"},{"id":"35868776","text":"Mordellistena falli is a beetle in the genus Mordellistena of the family Mordellidae.

A few weeks before, a bomb damaged an anti-racket officer, and subsequent police raids led to the arrest of 16 mafia members. Also, the school is named after prosecuting magistrate Francesca Morvillo (Giovanni Falcone's wife), victim of mafia murdered in a massive terrorist bombing, and the Brindisi bomb took place just five days before the 20th anniversary of Capaci bombing, and an anti-mafia march was scheduled in Brindisi the same day. Later investigations established attacker as a lone wolf perpetrator, foreign from organized crime and international terrorism. ==Arrests and prison== Within 24 hours after the attack, police arrested two men suspected of carrying out the bombing. They were taken in for questioning after police examined the film taken from nearby security cameras. The footage revealed a well-dressed, middle-aged man activating a remote control that detonated the bomb just after the bus unloaded students. One of the suspects was a man aged between 50 and 55 with a military background and \\"knowledge of electronics\\". Both men were subsequently released after police determined that they had no connection to the bombing. Further investigations moved from organized crime, due to lack of tangible evidences. In June 2013 Giovanni Vantaggiato, who admitted to have managed the bombing for personal reasons, was sentenced to life in prison for the crime.Man 'confesses to bombing Brindisi school', The Guardian, article by Andrea Vogt, June 7, 2012. ==See also== * Terrorism in the European Union == References == Category:2012 murders in Europe Category:2010s murders in Italy Category:School bombings Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2012 Category:Murdered Italian children Category:Terrorist incidents in Italy Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in Italy Category:Brindisi Category:2012 crimes in Italy Category:May 2012 crimes Category:May 2012 events in Europe Category:Terrorist incidents in Italy in the 2010s ","title":"Brindisi school bombing"},{"id":"35869003","text":"In human anatomy, the mouth is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food and produces saliva. The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane epithelium lining the inside of the mouth. In addition to its primary role as the beginning of the digestive system, in humans the mouth also plays a significant role in communication. While primary aspects of the voice are produced in the throat, the tongue, lips, and jaw are also needed to produce the range of sounds included in human language. The mouth consists of two regions, the vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The mouth, normally moist, is lined with a mucous membrane, and contains the teeth. The lips mark the transition from mucous membrane to skin, which covers most of the body. == Structure  Oral cavity === Anatomy of the mouth. Floor of the mouth with Lingual frenum and sublingual fold The mouth consists of 2 regions: the vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The vestibule is the area between the teeth, lips and cheeks. The oral cavity is bounded at the sides and in front by the alveolar process (containing the teeth) and at the back by the isthmus of the fauces. Its roof is formed by hard palate at the front, and a soft palate at the back. The uvula projects downwards from the middle of the soft palate at its back. The floor is formed by the mylohyoid muscles and is occupied mainly by the tongue. A mucous membrane ‚Äì the oral mucosa, lines the sides and under surface of the tongue to the gums, lining the inner aspect of the jaw (mandible). It receives the secretions from the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. === Orifice === A closed human mouth. While shut, the orifice of the mouth forms a line between the upper and lower lip. In facial expression, this mouth line is iconically shaped like an up-open parabola in a smile, and like a down-open parabola in a frown. A down-turned mouth means a mouth line forming a down-turned parabola, and when permanent can be normal. Also, a down-turned mouth can be part of the presentation of Prader-Willi syndrome. ===Nerve supply=== The teeth and the periodontium (i.e. the tissues that support the teeth) are innervated by the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Maxillary (upper) teeth and their associated periodontal ligament are innervated by the superior alveolar nerves, branches of the maxillary division, termed the posterior superior alveolar nerve, anterior superior alveolar nerve, and the variably present middle superior alveolar nerve. These nerves form the superior dental plexus above the maxillary teeth. The mandibular (lower) teeth and their associated periodontal ligament are innervated by the inferior alveolar nerve, a branch of the mandibular division. This nerve runs inside the mandible, within the inferior alveolar canal below the mandibular teeth, giving off branches to all the lower teeth (inferior dental plexus). The oral mucosa of the gingiva (gums) on the facial (labial) aspect of the maxillary incisors, canines and premolar teeth is innervated by the superior labial branches of the infraorbital nerve. The posterior superior alveolar nerve supplies the gingiva on the facial aspect of the maxillary molar teeth. The gingiva on the palatal aspect of the maxillary teeth is innervated by the greater palatine nerve apart from in the incisor region, where it is the nasopalatine nerve (long sphenopalatine nerve). The gingiva of the lingual aspect of the mandibular teeth is innervated by the sublingual nerve, a branch of the lingual nerve. The gingiva on the facial aspect of the mandibular incisors and canines is innervated by the mental nerve, the continuation of the inferior alveolar nerve emerging from the mental foramen. The gingiva of the buccal (cheek) aspect of the mandibular molar teeth is innervated by the buccal nerve (long buccal nerve). === Development === The philtrum is the vertical groves in the upper lip, formed where the nasomedial and maxillary processes meet during embryo development. When these processes fail to fuse fully, either a hare lip or cleft palate, (or both) can result. The nasolabial folds are the deep creases of tissue that extend from the nose to the sides of the mouth. One of the first signs of age on the human face is the increase in prominence of the nasolabial folds. == Function == The mouth plays an important role in eating, drinking, and speaking. Mouth breathing refers to the act of breathing through the mouth (as a temporary backup system) if there is an obstruction to breathing through the nose, which is the designated breathing organ for the human body. Infants are born with a sucking reflex, by which they instinctively know to suck for nourishment using their lips and jaw. The mouth also helps in chewing and biting food. For some disabled people, especially many disabled artists, who through illness, accident or congenital disability have lost dexterity, their mouths take the place of their hands, when typing, texting, writing, making drawings, paintings and other works of art by maneuvering brushes and other tools, in addition to the basic oral functions. Mouth painters hold the brush in their mouth or between their teeth and maneuver it with their tongue and cheek muscles, but mouth painting can be strenuous for neck and jaw muscles since the head has to perform the same back and forth movement as a hand does when painting. A male mouth can hold, on average, 71.2 ml, while a female mouth holds 55.4 ml.Nascimento WV1, Cassiani RA, Dantas RO., 2012, \\"Gender effect on oral volume capacity\\", Dysphagia, 27(3):384-9. == See also == * Head and neck anatomy * Mouth breathing * Index of oral health and dental articles * List of basic dentistry topics ==Further reading== * == References Category:Facial features Category:Mouth Mouth Category:Human head and neck Category:Speech organs Category:Human mouth anatomy Category:Digestive system ","title":"Human mouth"},{"id":"35869004","text":"Francisco Carlos (born 26 April 1963), known as Chiquinho Carlos, is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a forward.

He studied law and political science, and then worked as a lawyer in nearby Bamberg. In 1865 incumbent mayor Jacob Hopfenst√§tter died, offering Z√ºrn a chance to return to his hometown. Against qualified competition, on 7 December 1865 Z√ºrn was unanimously elected to the position of mayor at the age of 31. == Work == During his long tenure he promoted housing and road building, reformed the school system, and created the Ring Park around the old town. The preceding Thirty years war had continuously devoured W√ºrzburg's finances and resulted in an expansive system of fortifications that blocked the spatial growth of the city. Traffic was impeded and building restrictions restricted industrial and commercial life. The subsequent shelling of the city by the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 clearly showed that the old fortifications offered no military protection. Z√ºrn then spearheaded difficult negotiations to remove the fortifications on the right of the Main River. He also managed to buy the entire old railway station on the site of today's Louis Street, which was conceived as upper-class residential road. He leveled the city gates obstructing traffic, broke through the walls to create new radial roads, and created the main ring road. A new park design, including a new city office of dedicated gardener, resulted in an advanced park system for its time. These changes resulted in tremendous growth of the city. Of 33,414 persons in 1867, the population increased to 54,457 in 1890. As a visible expression of his services, Z√ºrn received two orders from the Ludwig II of Bavaria. Typical of his modesty, he refused an offer for admission to Bavarian nobility. In 1870 he was awarded honorary citizenship of the town. ==References== * Biography of Georg Z√ºrn ==External links== Category:1834 births Category:1884 deaths Category:Politicians from W√ºrzburg Category:Mayors of places in Bavaria ","title":"Georg Z√ºrn"},{"id":"35869095","text":"Forfey Festival was an annual music festival held on Forfey Farm near Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.

He was contemporary to the Kakatiya king, Orugallu. There is a mention about Krishnamaacharyulu, his compositions and his miraculous life in Prataaapa rudra charitraand siddheswara charitra Currently, Annamacharya of the 15th century is regarded as first vaggeyakara in Telugu. But, that position belongs to Krishnamayya, as he lived 300 years prior to Annamacharya. Musicologists and scholars believe that Krishnayya‚Äôs writings bore an indelible influence on later poet-composers. For instance, the song, ‚ÄòYe Kulajudaina Nemi‚Äô was inspired by Krishnamayya. His compositions were rendered in simple prose format but encased the highest Vaishanavism. There is no linguistic ornamentation, so to say. He is venerated as the father of sankeertana by the later saint-poets of Telugu language. He was supposed to have carried his four lakh vachanams (prosody) on copper plates when he went on a pilgrimage. Of these, only 200 have been retrieved so far and are in existence as of now.

Library)(manuscripts), Mss manu Scripts \`Prataapa Rudreeyam') and translated to Keerthans by Sri. Vinukomnda Murali Mohan, a noted Musician of Vizag, so it would be easier for everyone to remember and render. The Keertans of Krishnamayya were composed in three different styles i.e. traditional padhyams, keerthans and in a special style fusing modern trend to suit the tastes of all generations. ==Krishnamayya project== Sri. SriKantha Krishnamacharyulu, also known as Krishnamayya, was a renowned devotee and poet belonging to the 12th- 13th century. It was believed that he composed over four hundred thousand vachanas in praise of Lord Sri. Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha. Only 200 are known to have survived to this day. His Simhagiri Vachanas are still recited in Simhachalam in Vizag. His works were perhaps available to Annamayya. He wrote poetry in simple, non-metrical language that was free from any ornamentation or high vocabulary that distracts the attention from the essential philosophy of his writings. Krishnamayya was also a converted Vaishnavite. It was without any doubt that Annamacharya was highly influenced by Krishnamacharya as his name was also mentioned in one of his works. The Krishnamayya foundation of Visakhapatnam had launched a project, on 4 July 2009, in the name of Saint Krishnamayya viz. \\"Krishnamayya project\\" under the Chairmanship of the Hon. H. H. Dr. P Ananda Gajapathi Raju former Education Minister of A.P and the hereditary trustee of Sri Varaha lakshmi Narasimha Swamy vari Devastanam. With a mission to popularise the life and works of Srikantha Krishnamaachaaryulu, a project was launched by Dr. Pusapaati Ananada Gajapathi Raju, the hereditary trustee of Simhachalam Devasthanam on 4 July 2009 Krishnamayya project is the brain child of Sri. Vinukonda Murali Mohan, S/O Jogarao Sri.

He was born in the village of Lije≈°anj near Zvornik, now he lives in Vienna, Austria since 1992. He attended schools in Drinjaƒça (primary school) and Gymnasium (secondary school ) in Zvornik. Then he studied Astronomy at the University of Belgrade 1981-1984. He switched his interest to pedagogy and graduated at the Pedagogical Academy, University of Tuzla 1987 which gained him a right to work as a primary school teacher. Marinko has been writing poems since 1976 in the opus ‚ÄûProvincijski razgovori‚Äú (Provincial conversations). He never publishes his poems as a collection of poems in a printed form, only within a free online Magnum opus Provincijski razgovori (Provincial conversations). Opus consists of three parts: Provincijski razgovori (Provincial conversations); U svijetu pra≈°ine (In the world of dust) and Urbani razgovori (Urban conversations). His poems have a humanistic and antiwar character, with an antipatriotic connotation. His poems have been translated into English, Dutch and German. He also writes in German. His poetry reflects on the burning problems of society as well as his own philosophy of life and a meaning. ‚ÄûParticipants‚Äú of the conversations (as author calls them) are the Teacher (Uƒçitelj), the Preacher (Propovijednik), the Poet (Pjesnik), the Philosopher (filozof), the Ordinary Optimist (Obiƒçni Optimista), the Ordinary Pessimist (Obiƒçni Pesimista), the Ironic Pessimist (Ironiƒçni Pesimista) and the Ironic Optimist (Ironiƒçni Optimista). Those participants reflect authors' capability to transform his view of the world through seemingly different personalities and attitudes. Marinkos' poetry summarizes many aspects of life ‚Äì from daily motives of love, emotional plays and love for life, to a high critique of hot society topics. It's very clear that an author with his social critique goes out of the frames of a national or any other conservative belief and does an unbiased perspective of Balkans with, often, satirical elements and a firm structure. His style is vivid, his messages have a social value and together they represent a compact philosophical approach of author. Marinko also wrote many poems inspired by his pupils while he worked as a teacher. His Urban conversations are distinctive from Provincial conversations when comparing the style as well as the overall atmosphere in the poems. These differences profoundly, still subtly, indicate the basic conflict between a province and urbanity, between our instinctive simplicity and achieved complex abstraction. ==References External links == * http://marinkostevanovic.blogspot.com * http://provincijskirazgovori.blogspot.com * http://www.yurope.com/people/marinko/ * Dr Hariz Halilovich, Bosnian Austrians: Accidental Migrants in Trans-Local and Cyber Spaces, Page 11 Category:1961 births Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina writers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina poets Category:Living people ","title":"Marinko Stevanoviƒá"},{"id":"35869138","text":"The church shortly before its destruction in 1861.

According to the tradition, it changed name in 1279 after the drowning of some pilgrims going to venerate the body of St. Lucy, stolen by the Venetians in the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade and then in the island of San Giorgio Maggiore. It was thus decided to move the corpse to the church in the main island of Venice. In 1580, just before his death, Andrea Palladio had executed some drawings for a renovation of the interior, although the church was finished 30 years after and thus his intervention is disputed/ In 1806, after the Napoleonic invasion of northern Italy, the nuns then holding the church and its convent were expelled. In 1860, when the city was connected to the mainland's railway, the complex was destined to demolition. It was replaced by the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station.

He was the first openly gay jurist elected by the Virginia General Assembly. After graduation from university, Thorne-Begland served in a jet combat squadron of the United States Navy. During the 1992 presidential campaign, he appeared on the television news program Nightline to criticize the Navy's policy of excluding homosexuals, identified himself as gay, and was honorably discharged from the service. As a result of the appeal processes, Thorne-Begland became interested in the law and graduated from law school. After serving twelve years as a prosecutor, Thorne-Begland was nominated for an open seat on the General District Court of Richmond in 2012, but the Virginia House of delegates rejected him for the position for his perceived advocacy on homosexual issues. The Richmond Circuit Court judges granted him a temporary appointment to the post on June 14, 2012. On January 15, 2013, he was confirmed in the position by both houses of the Virginia General Assembly. ==Early life and military career== Tracy W. Thorne grew up in a well-off family in West Palm Beach, Florida. Following his graduation from Vanderbilt University, he entered the US Navy in 1988, inspired by reading Stephen Coonts' novel Flight of the Intruder about naval aviators in the Vietnam War. He was first in his flight training class, and served in Attack Squadron 65, the \\"Fighting Tigers\\", at Oceana Naval Air Station flying the A-6 Intruder. Initially denying his homosexuality, Thorne accepted it in 1990 when he visited a gay bar for the first time on New Year's Eve. In 1992, Thorne came out to his squadronmates, who he later stated were supportive: \\"It was a complete non-issue\\". In April he spoke with an aide of Colorado congresswoman Pat Schroeder, who encouraged him to go public with his story to build popular support for a bill to overturn the ban on gay service members. Thorne agreed to do so, and completed the process of coming out to family members, including his father and brother. On May 19, 1992, during a presidential campaign in which Democratic candidate Bill Clinton was proposing an end to the military's exclusion of homosexuals, Thorne openly identified as homosexual during an interview with Ted Koppel on the ABC television news program Nightline. Thorne later appeared on NBC's Today Show and CNN's Sonya Live. Within days, the Navy began discharge proceedings against him, though he was not formally discharged until 1995. By the time of his first discharge hearing in August 1992, Thorne had reached the rank of lieutenant.Thorne was represented at his discharge proceedings by Luther Ziegler, who later became an Episcopal priest and a chaplain at Harvard University. Harvard Chaplains: \\"Rev. Luther Zeigler\\". Retrieved May 19, 2012. Archived from the original on March 17, 2013. On May 11, 1993, he testified before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, which was surveying the opinions of service members on the question of service by open homosexuals. He told the senators that his discussion with his peers following his television disclosure was \\"a nonevent\\" and called the policy banning service by homosexuals \\"Government-sanctioned discrimination.\\" During the committee session, South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond advised Thorne to seek psychiatric help. In 1994, President Clinton instituted \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT), a policy which barred open homosexuals from military service but forbade officers to investigate the sexuality of service members. Thorne's previous assertion became a test of this new policy, and proceedings against him continued. While Thorne's discharge proceedings were under way, he was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal for \\"superb leadership, exceptional professionalism and total devotion to duty\\".Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Richard Carelli, \\"Supreme Court refuses to review U.S. military's 'don't ask, don't tell' rule,\\" October 19, 1998. p. 8A. Retrieved May 19, 2012 In 1994, a Navy board of inquiry recommended that Thorne be honorably discharged, though the discharge was not official until May 6, 1995. Thorne then brought suit in federal court to overturn the discharge; the court ordered his reinstatement while the case proceeded. After he lost his challenge to DADT in both U.S. District Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal on October 19, 1998, and he was again discharged. Thorne's various cases left him with a new interest in the law. He pursued a degree at the University of Richmond School of Law, graduating in 1997. ==Judicial nomination== Thorne-Begland went on to serve 12 years as a prosecutor and became chief deputy commonwealth's attorney for Richmond. In 2012, he was nominated to fill a vacancy on the state's 13th General District Court, which serves Richmond, Virginia. Before the vote, the conservative advocacy group Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied heavily against his nomination due to his homosexuality and past activism. He had served for a time on the board of Equality Virginia, a gay rights advocacy organization. If his nomination had succeeded, he would have become the first openly gay judge in the state. On May 14, the day of the scheduled vote on Thorne-Begland's appointment, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell stated that the candidate's sexuality should not be an issue: \\"All I can tell you is what I've always said about judges, and that is that these ought to be merit-based selections solely based on a person's skill, ability, fairness, judicial temperament\\". Thorne- Begland also attempted to address concerns by pledging to \\"neutrally apply the laws\\" and avoid political advocacy. Some House Republicans were critical of Thorne-Begland's lying to the Navy about his homosexuality, stating that his violation of the military's code of conduct made him unfit for a judgeship. Delegates also stated that they felt Thorne-Begland's homosexuality and previous history of activism would influence his rulings on the bench. Following a lengthy discussion, the vote on Thorne-Begland's nomination was held shortly after 1 am on May 15. The vote split largely along party lines, with 21 Democrats and 8 Republicans supporting him and 31 Republicans opposing him, well short of the 51-vote majority needed. Following the vote, the House of Delegates adjourned for the year. === Responses === Thorne-Begland's supporters described the opposition to his appointment as \\"discrimination\\" and \\"bigotry\\", while his opponents described it as a necessary measure against his \\"aggressive activist homosexual agenda\\". Virginia Republican Bob Marshall noted on CNN that \\"Sodomy is not a civil right\\", and stated that Thorne- Begland's homosexuality would make it impossible for him to judge cases impartially: \\"if you have a bar room fight between a homosexual and heterosexual, I'm concerned about possible bias.\\" Republican senate candidate and former senator George Allen expressed disagreement with the vote, stating that judges should be appointed based on judicial qualifications rather than sexual orientation. Stephanie Cutter of US President Barack Obama's re- election campaign described Thorne-Begland as \\"overly-qualified\\" for the post, stating \\"He is a well-known successful prosecutor ... That is how the legislature should be making these decisions. Not based on someone's own sexual orientation.\\" The campaign of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declined to comment. The New York Times accused the House of \\"clear and shameful\\" bias. The Washington Post stated that \\"no matter how they dressed it up, the Republicans' opposition boiled down to old-fashioned prejudice.\\" Dahlia Lithwick of Slate wrote that if Thorne-Begland's previous advocacy for gay rights disqualified him from the bench, Thurgood Marshall's advocacy with the NAACP and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's advocacy for women's rights would have disqualified them from the U.S. Supreme Court. The New Jersey Star-Ledger described the decision as \\"stunning in its blatant prejudice.\\" === Judgeship === Thorne-Begland commented that he was \\"looking forward to continuing to serve the citizens of the city of Richmond and the great commonwealth of Virginia\\" in his role as a prosecutor. A month later, on June 14, the Richmond Circuit Court judges appointed him to the position for which he was rejected by the legislature. The temporary appointment began July 1, 2012, to expire 30 days after the date the next legislative session began. Governor McDonnell's spokesman congratulated Thorne-Begland on the appointment, stating, \\"the Governor believes Mr. Thorne-Begland is well-qualified to serve on the bench\\". Marshall called the move \\"highly imprudent and arrogant\\" of the judges: \\"They're contesting the authority of the General Assembly. . . . This is an act of defiance on their part. When appointed officials get in fights with elected officials, they invariably lose.\\" Thorne-Begland stated that \\"I look forward to serving the citizens of the City of Richmond as a jurist, and over the coming months, I hope that my service provides comfort to all Virginians that I remain committed to the faithful application of the laws and Constitutions of Virginia and the United States of America.\\" On January 15, 2013, the House of Delegates elected Thorne-Begland to a full six-year term with a vote of 66‚Äì28, with one abstention. The 28 votes against him were all cast by members of the Republican party. The Senate followed with a vote of 28‚Äì0, with 12 Republican senators not voting. Thorne-Begland was the first openly gay jurist elected by the General Assembly. He was sworn in for his full term on March 1, 2013. ==Personal life== Thorne-Begland lives with his husband, originally Michael Begland, a Richmond attorney. They have combined their original surnames, and both use the surname Thorne-Begland. They had a commitment ceremony in 2001 after 8 years together and soon decided they wanted to have children. Using eggs from Michael Thorne-Begland's sister and sperm from Tracy Thorne-Begland, they used a surrogate to give birth to their twins in 2004 in a Maryland hospital. ==References *Board of Inquiry Proceedings in the Case of Lieutenant Tracy W.

Some of the jail terms he served are outlined below. He was also arrested and lathi charged for his participation in the Quit India Movement and the Telangana Agitation. The aggressive Garapaty played an active role even during his imprisonment times by participating in hunger strikes and agitations. Even though he was with the Indian National Congress Party, he was later influenced by the Communist ideology and actively promoted and strengthened the party throughout the West Godavari District.

Its common names include the mottled star, false ochre sea star and Troschel's true star. It is found in Kamchatka and the north western coast of North America. ==Taxonomy== The description of this species was first formally published in 1862 by William Stimpson under the name Asterias troschelii (Stimpson first presented the new species in a lecture at the Boston Society of Natural History in 1861). The holotype was collected in Puget sound, Washington. Only part of one arm still remains of this smallish specimen at the United States National Museum. It was moved to the new genus Evasterias by Addison Emery Verrill in 1914, with as the type species. Verrill published five new varieties (alveolata, densa, parvispina, rudis and subnodosa) besides the nominate variety, and also published E. acanthostoma in 1914. Alexander Michailovitsch Djakonov synonymised all of Verrill's varieties, but retained alveolata as a forma, and also made Verrill's E. acanthostoma a form of E. troschelii, leaving the species with three forms including the nominate. ==Description== Evasterias troschelii (orange variant) The mottled star is a large starfish with a radius of up to . It has a small disc and five long narrow arms often turned up at the tip. The widest point of the arms is a little distance away from the edge of the disc. The aboral (upper or dorsal) surface of the disc is covered with a network of calcareous plates with spines about long surrounded by smaller spines and crossed and straight pedicellariae, minute pincer-like structures with two jaws. There is an irregular line of white-tipped spines running down the centre of the arms and the whole upper surface is rough to the touch. On the oral (lower or ventral) surface a long ambulacral groove stretches from the central mouth to the tip of each arm with four rows of tube feet and clumps of pedicellariae and spines on either side. The colour is very variable and includes plain or mottled shades of orange, brown, greenish-grey, bluish-grey and pale purple. The outer edges of the arms often have a contrasting coloured rim and the underside is pale brown. ==Distribution and habitat== Evasterias troschelii is found on the west coast of North America. Its range extends from Pribilof Islands, Alaska southwards to Monterey Bay, California but it is rarely seen south of Puget Sound. It also occurs in Kamchatka (Bechevinskaya Bay). It is usually found on rocks and pebbles and occasionally on sand, at depths down to about or . In bays and other sheltered locations it largely replaces the other common species of the area, the purple sea star (Pisaster ochraceus). ==EcologyBreeding=== In the north of its range, breeding takes place from April to June. Large numbers of small eggs are produced and fertilisation is external. The bipinnaria larvae that develop from these form part of the zooplankton and disperse with the currents. ===Prey=== The mottled star is a predator and feeds largely on bivalve molluscs. With its tube feet it can exert a powerful traction on the two valves of a mollusc shell, pulling them sufficiently far apart to insert part of its stomach through the gap. It then uses digestive enzymes to break down the mollusc's tissues before sucking them out and removing its stomach from the shell. It also consumes barnacles, chitons, gastropod molluscs, tunicates and brachiopods. Some species of limpet exhibit behavioural responses to the presence of the mottled star and are able to evade it. Petroleum hydrocarbons, such as those released as a result of the Exxon Valdez spillage, have a greater effect on the feeding and growth of the mottled star than on one of its main prey species, the mussel Mytilus edulis. Researchers surmised that pollution of the marine environment with oil might result in the domination of the mussel in the low intertidal zone of the region. ===Other species interactions=== The scale worm Arctonoe fragilis is often found living on the surface or in an ambulacral groove of the mottled star as a commensal. The parasitic ciliate Orchitophrya stellarum has several hosts, one of which is the mottled star. It lives among the spines on the body and arms until the starfish is ready to breed when it moves inside its host, probably entering through a gonopore. It makes its way to the gonads of the male starfish and feeds on the sperm, effectively castrating its host. Juvenile Alaskan king crabs (Paralithodes camtschaticus) have been observed living as commensals on the surface of the mottled star, sheltering between its arms. Adult king crabs have been reported as attacking and eating the starfish. It is also preyed on by gulls in the intertidal zone and by the morning sunstar (Solaster dawsoni) and the sunflower seastar (Pycnopodia helianthoides). ==References== Category:Asteriidae Category:Animals described in 1862 ","title":"Evasterias troschelii"},{"id":"35869215","text":"Prince Giorgi Bagrationi (), also known as Prince Giorgi Bagration Bagrationi (born 27 September 2011), is a Georgian prince of the Bagrationi dynasty which reigned until the early 19th century in Georgia and its successive realms. ==Family== Born in Spain, Giorgi is the only child of Prince David Bagration of Mukhrani and Princess Anna Bagration-Gruzinsky, born to their (only) civil marriage in 2010 (their religious marriage had been contracted in February 2009 and was dissolved in August 2009). ·Éì·Éê·Éò·Éë·Éê·Éì·Éê ·Éí·Éò·Éù·É†·Éí·Éò ·Éë·Éê·Éí·É†·Éê·É¢·Éò·Éù·Éú-·Éë·Éê·Éí·É†·Éê·É¢·Éò·Éù·Éú·Éò ·Éô·Éï·Éò·É†·Éò·É° ·Éû·Éê·Éö·Éò·É¢·É†·Éê ·Éì·Éê·Éï·Éò·Éó ·Éì·Éê ·Éê·Éú·Éê ·Éë·Éê·Éí·É†·Éê·É¢·Éò·Éù·Éú·Éî·Éë·É° ·Éõ·Éî·Éõ·Éô·Éï·Éò·Éì·É†·Éî-·Éí·Éò·Éù·É†·Éí·Éò ·Éë·Éê·Éí·É†·Éê·É¢·Éò·Éù·Éú·Éò ·É®·Éî·Éî·É´·Éò·Éú·Éê·Éó ·Éí·Éî·Éù ·Éú·Éò·É£·É°·Éò –†–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –ª–∏–Ω–∏—è –í –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–∏ —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞ –ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑ Online –í –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–∏ —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–∏ –ë–∞–≥—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω-–ë–∞–≥—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω–∏ –ù–∞—à–∞ —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞ He potentially unites in his person the claims of the Mukhraneli and Gruzinsky branches of the House of Bagration to the former throne of the Kingdom of Georgia.

The show, currently airing on Fox Footy, takes a comedic look back at the previous week in the Australian Football League. First aired in 2007, the show is currently hosted by former footballers Jason Dunstall and Cameron Mooney. ==History== Originally called Before the Bounce, the show was broadcast on Friday nights before the opening game of the round. The original hosts were Dunstall, Frawley, journalists Gerard Whateley and Damian Barrett, and former footballer Billy Brownless. In 2011, the show's name changed to After the Bounce and it moved to Sunday nights, normally immediately after the final game of the round. Whateley hosted the show for the final time in 2011, before his other show, AFL 360, was extended to be broadcast four nights per week in 2012 with the launch of the new 24/7 AFL channel Fox Footy. When co- host Damien Fleming left Australia to cover the Australian cricket team's tour of the West Indies in March 2012, he was replaced by Andrew Gaze. For 2014, the show's name was changed again, this time to simply Bounce, and it moved to Wednesday nights at 8.30pm following AFL 360. In 2015, it returned to the Sunday night timeslot following the final game of the round, but retained its title of Bounce. The show also became sponsored by Holden. Following the 2015 season, Alastair Lynch left the show in order to spend more time with his family. He was due to be replaced by former stand-in presenter Nathan Grima, who had recently announced his retirement from the AFL. However, in February 2016, Grima announced a comeback to football, signing with the Essendon Football Club as a top-up player due to the club's supplements controversy. As such, it was later announced that former footballer Cameron Mooney would join the series, with Barry Hall to also join the series for the 'Yesterday's Heroes' segment. In April 2016, Gaze announced that he would be leaving the show after the show on 24 April 2016 to take up a role as head coach of the Sydney Kings in the National Basketball League. Gaze would remain on the show on a part-time basis, in rotation with other guest panellists including the return of Fleming, former footballers Brian Lake and Robert DiPierdomenico and comedians Julian Schiller and Tegan Higginbotham amongst others. This format would continue in future seasons. The 350th episode of Bounce aired on 23 June 2019. On 9 September 2019, Danny Frawley died in a single-car accident. Bounce did not air for the rest of the 2019 season, however a special episode appeared a week later in his memory. Approaching the 2020 season, it was announced Bounce will return with Dunstall remaining as host, Gaze increasing his presence in the show, and Mooney, Sharni Layton and Bernie Vince resuming their roles as other members on the panel.

The state would purchase a 51% share, with the national government controlling 51% of this package and ten provincial governments receiving the remaining 49%. The bill was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Congress, and was signed by the president on May 5. The government of Argentina eventually agreed to pay US$5 billion in compensation to Repsol, which had previously owned YPF. ==Background== YPF was founded in 1922 as the first oil company in the world to be established as a state enterprise. The company grew to become largest in its sector in Argentina, and despite the divestiture of a sizable percentage of its extractive, refining, logistic, and retail infrastructure during its 1993 privatization, YPF in 2012 operated 52% of the nation's refinery capacity and accounted for 57% of the national market in gasoline and other motor fuels. Its share of petroleum and natural gas production nationally was 34% and 23%, respectively, in 2011; company revenues that year were US$13.7 billion. The firm was privatized in 1993 on the initiative of President Carlos Menem and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo pursuant to the State Reform Law of 1989, which authorized the president to present bills to Congress for the privatization of any of the numerous state enterprises in operation at the time. Madrid-based Repsol acquired a majority stake in 1999. Oil and gas production subsequently weakened while demand increased, and in 2011 Argentina recorded the first energy trade deficit since 1987. ==Renationalization== Investment in exploration at YPF as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other Repsol subsidiaries, and fell from 30 new wells in 1998 to eight in 2010 (French energy firm Total S.A. overtook YPF as the leading oil driller in Argentina). Its reserves of crude and natural gas fell 60% and 67% respectively between 1999 and 2011, and declines in output at the firm represented 54% of the nation's lost oil production and 97% in the case of natural gas. Repsol and some market analysts blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports and prospecting leases, and price controls on domestic oil and gas. YPF, however, remained profitable throughout Repsol's tenure even as output fell, and net income from 1999 to 2011 at YPF totaled nearly US$16.5 billion. The Kirchner administration in turn pointed to high dividend yields and low investment levels at YPF in relation to profits. Argentine Economy Minister Hern√°n Lorenzino claimed that asset stripping at YPF had financed Repsol's expansion in other parts of the world, while Repsol officials denied charges of underinvestment in its YPF operations and instead cited the Vaca Muerta discovery as a motivation for the takeover. Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 km¬≤ (11,600 mi¬≤) unconventional oil field with proven recoverable reserves of up to 927 million barrels, had been discovered by RepsolYPF in November 2011. Repsol executives declared however that government policies would have to change in order to allow investment in new production. Following bills signed by governors in six fossil-fuel producing provinces during March and April 2012 revoking YPF leases accounting for over a fifth of its production, the president announced on April 16 that the Argentine Government would acquire a majority stake in YPF. Repsol YPF Gas, a liquefied natural gas subsidiary in which Repsol had an 85% stake, was concurrently nationalized on April 19. The Chinese state oil concern, Sinopec, was reported to have been in talks to buy out Repsol's share in YPF ‚Äì a potential deal scuttled by the Argentine announcement. ==Resulting dispute== Repsol officials maintained that, per company statutes, the acquisition by any one party of stock held by Repsol equaling a 15% stake or more would trigger a mandatory purchase of Repsol's entire 57% stake (rather than the 51% sought). Repsol officials calculated compensation by multiplying the highest price earnings ratio reached by YPF in the prior two years by its earnings per share in 2011, and arrived at US$10.5 billion for a 57% stake. Argentine Deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof rejected these demands, however, citing debts of nearly US$9 billion. The book value of YPF was US$4.4 billion at the end of 2011; its total market capitalization on the day of the announcement was US$10.4 billion. Repsol claimed that the Argentine Government drove down YPF shares ahead of the announcement (market price of the shares declined by over half from February to April), and chairman Antoni Brufau estimated the company's potential loss at ‚Ç¨5.7 billion (US$7.5 billion). Repsol retaliated by canceling nine shipments of liquefied natural gas to Argentine state energy distributor Enarsa, claiming the government breached contracts following the seizure of YPF. Repsol filed a lawsuit at the World Bank‚Äôs International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes on May 15. The Government of Spain petitioned the European Commissioner for Trade for sanctions against Argentine exports. The Spanish Government did unilaterally curtail biodiesel purchases from Argentina (its main provider), as well as from Indonesia. Following a complaint filed at the World Trade Organization by the Argentine Government as well as higher costs for biodiesel distributors in Spain itself however, boycotts of both Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel were lifted by January 2013. An audit of Repsol documents conducted by Kicillof and Planning Minister Julio de Vido in May uncovered what Kicillof described as a \\"debasement of the company and a policy of creating shortages that would raise domestic prices to those prevailing internationally;\\" these findings were published on June 1 in the Mosconi Report. The Government of the Province of Santa Cruz published the results of an investigation of 13,000 inactive YPF oil wells on May 14, finding that 8,000 of these leaked and that at least US$3.5 billion of environmental damage had been caused by these; an environmental law enacted by the province in 2010 mandated the inventory and maintenance of all such wells. Other claims, including environmental damage in five other provinces, a tax debt in Chubut Province, and a judicial injunction issued against Repsol over their illegal sale in 2011 of 45 million shares belonging to an employees' severance fund, raised their potential liability to US$15 billion. An agreement was reached with Repsol on November 27, 2013, whereby the latter would be compensated for a 51% stake in YPF with approximately US$5 billion in 10-year corporate bonds. Repsol sold its remaining 12% stake to Morgan Stanley the following May. ==The Petersen Group== The largest minority shareholder, the Petersen Group, held a 25% stake at the time of the renationalization, and had financed their initial purchase of 15% of the stock in 2007 with a vendor's loan from Repsol for ‚Ç¨1.5 billion. The chairman and majority owner of the Petersen Group, Enrique Eskenazi, was close to President N√©stor Kirchner, who supported Eskenazi's bid to become YPF's principal Argentine stockholder. Eskenazi benefited from a dividend distribution rate at YPF of 90%, which allowed the Group to repay its vendor's loan in installments. The 2008 agreement required Repsol to buy back shares owned by the Group and to assume the loan should the Madrid-based firm lose majority control of YPF. Sebasti√°n Eskenazi, the son of the Petersen Group chairman and CEO of YPF until April 16, indicated however that the group would forego this option. The Group defaulted in May on a Credit Suisse loan taken in 2011 to raise its stake in YPF from 15% to 25%. Officials at Credit Suisse and at other creditors involved, including Banco Ita√∫, BNP Paribas, and Goldman Sachs, announced on May 11 that the Group's shares would be repossessed as collateral. Repsol, as another of the Group's creditors affected by their default, also repossessed a block of shares, thus increasing their stake in YPF to 12%; following a steep rally in YPF shares, Repsol sold its stake a year later. ==Procedural and company developments== The Argentine Senate approved the takeover on April 26 with 63 votes in favor of the measure, three opposing it and four abstentions. The Chamber of Deputies approved the bill on May 4 with 208 votes out of 257, and the president signed the renationalization into law on May 5. Miguel Galluccio, an Argentine petroleum engineer with experience at both YPF and at oilfield services leader Schlumberger as president of its production management division in London, was appointed CEO. Galluccio presented an investment program on June 5, 2012, to increase oil exploration by tenfold and gas exploration by twenty-fold, with the goal of raising production of oil and gas by 6% annually and of refined fuel by over 7% annually over five years. The US$39 billion plan would be largely self-financed, as well as by investments from Chevron Corporation and the periodic issuance of high-yield, 8.75% corporate bonds. These bond issuances were raised to US$1.5 billion per series in April 2015, as demand surged to US$4 billion. YPF acquired a controlling stake in Metrogas (the nation's largest gas distributor) in November. YPF stock rose by 190% from its post-nationalization depths in mid-2012 to the announcement of a compensation agreement with Repsol in November 2013. Production declines of 6% annually under Repsol were likewise reversed. Overall output rose by 3% in 2013, and a further 8.7% in oil and 12.5% in gas during 2014. Output increased a further 3% in 2015. Development prospects for the Vaca Muerta field, which by 2014 was estimated to contain at least 23 billion barrels of oil, attracted numerous joint exploratory ventures in subsequent years. The most significant such joint ventures include those signed with Chevron, Dow Chemical, and Petronas. The Vaca Muerta block operated jointly with Chevron produced 35,000 m¬≥ daily by 2014. Miguel Galuccio announced his resignation as CEO, effective April 30, 2016. == See also == *Pink tide ==References== Category:2012 in Argentina Category:Energy in Argentina Category:Nationalization Category:Presidency of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner Category:YPF ","title":"Renationalization of YPF"},{"id":"35869309","text":"Tamiya connector A Tamiya connector is a type of DC power connector, commonly used on radio-controlled model vehicle battery packs, drones and chargers.ElectriFly: Adapters and Connectors shows converter cables for connectors commonly used in the RC community. They are also commonly used on airsoft guns. ==Wiring== The usual wiring has the positive (red) wire running to the terminal with a square profile, and the negative (black) wire running to the half-circle, half-square terminal. This is true for both genders of connector. The female sockets are in a male housing and the male pins are in a female housing. The male pins (female housing) connector is usually on the battery side. In electrical and electronics engineering, the convention is that gender refers to the metal contact parts of a connector in order to avoid ambiguity. A large number of hobbyist retailers selling these connectors refer to the gender of the plastic housing, which is against convention and can lead to errors. In some cases, Mini-Tamiya connectors are wired in reverse polarity. This is often the case with airsoft guns, where the square profile terminal is the negative terminal and the rounded terminal is the positive terminal. ==Sizes== There are two sizes of Tamiya connectors: standard and mini. The outside dimensions of the standard connector is: * 13.4mm x 5.4mm x 26.8mm The outside dimensions of the mini connector is: * 9.9mm x 5.4mm x 22mm (about 3/8\\" x 7/32\\" x 7/8\\") ==Advantages== A useful feature of the Tamiya connectors is the locking mechanism which prevents accidental disconnection. The connector physically isolates the positive and negative wires so that the connectors remain safe to use in damp conditions. This makes them safe for use in relatively low-current applications (up to about 15 A) in dirty conditions (for example, model boats or RC cars used outdoors). ==See also== * DC connector * Electrical connector * Anderson Powerpole ==References Category:DC power connectors Category:Tamiya Corporation ","title":"Tamiya connector"},{"id":"35869336","text":"M'semen or msemen ( msamman, musamman), is a rich traditional flatbread originally from the Maghreb, common to Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.

M'semen can also be stuffed with meat. == Varieties and similar foods == There is a variety that is made from pulling the dough into strands and forming a disk that is also called malwi in North west Africa. It is also similar to the Somali sabaayah. == Recipe == The recipe uses flour, durum wheat semolina, dry yeast, melted butter, salt, sugar and a bit of water. These are mixed well together into a smooth dough mixture. The dough is cut into several balls, which are then rolled out on an oiled surface and folded into square pancakes. The goal being to spread the dough into the thinnest square or circle and then fold the sides back into a square, creating the signature layers of dough. Once the m'semen is folded, another is spread which is used to envelope a prior folded m'semen so as to create about 8 internal layers of dough. The key being that while one is folding, one must sprinkle semolina on the layers to prevent the layers from sticking entirely and to allow for the heat to then separate the layers when cooked on a griddle. ==See also== * List of breads * Berber cuisine == References == Category:Berber culture Category:Arab cuisine Category:Algerian cuisine Category:Moroccan cuisine Category:North African cuisine Category:Flatbreads ","title":"M'semen"},{"id":"35869337","text":"The Madonna and Child with Sts Jerome and Mary Magdalen (The Day) is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Correggio dating from around 1528 and housed in the Galleria Nazionale of Parma, Italy. ==History== The canvas was commissioned in 1523 by Briseide Colla for a private chapel on the right side of the church of Sant'Antonio Abate in Parma.

However, a handful of interpretations have been offered. Suggestions include the possibility that it may contain a corrupted version of the personal name Ethernan. If this is the case, it is likely to refer to the 7th century saint Ethernan about whom little is known but who was apparently venerated by the Picts. He is referred to in an entry from the Annals of Ulster from 669 AD as having been killed by the Picts along with Corindu. It is thought that these names may be P-Celtic and therefore Pictish in origin. Other examples of the name Ethernan being preserved on Pictish stones include, in Ogham, The Newton Stone (IDDARRNNN), Rodney's Stone (EDDARRNON) and The Scoonie Stone (EDDARRNONN), and, in Latin script, The Fordoun Stone (PIDARNOIN).

Prior to his appointment in the commission, he served as the Philippine Socioeconomic Planning Secretary from May 2012 to January 2016 under the administration of President Benigno S. Aquino III. As Socioeconomic Planning Secretary, he concurrently served as director-general of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and as chairman of the boards of the Philippine Statistics Authority, Philippine Institute for Development Studies, Philippine Center for Economic Development, and Public- Private Partnership Center. Prior to his Cabinet appointment, he was professor and dean of School of Economics of the University of the Philippines Diliman and concurrently executive director of the Philippine Center for Economic Development. On secondment from UP, he served as the Director-Chief Executive of the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), one of the centers of excellence of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO), in 2003‚Äì2009. Before joining the faculty of UP in 1987, he was research fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu and economist at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. A holder of PhD in economics from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, he has been an Academician of the National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) since 2008. == Early years == Balisacan was born in Solsona, Ilocos Norte, a remote town located at the foot of the Sierra Madre mountain range. Balisacan's father was initially a farm tenant tilling fields in a resource-poor, isolated village of the town. When their nun relative convinced his father to take on a janitorial job in Laoag City, they had to leave their farm life behind. In the city, Balisacan, his five other siblings and their parents stayed in a land where they were later evicted. Balisacan said he was in high school when their family was forced out of the property and had to go back to their tiny village at the easternmost part of Ilocos Norte. ‚ÄúIt was tough. It was only later on that I realized that we were an informal settler. We were squatting in somebody‚Äôs land. [When] I was already in high school, we were evicted from that place, and we had to return to that old town of ours,‚Äù Balisacan recalled. From his primary-school days all the way to his postgraduate studies, Balisacan had to rely on scholarships, grants, and part-time employment as his family was poor. He spent most of his formative years of basic education under the tutelage of Divine Word College of Laoag and completed the last two years of secondary education in Ablan Memorial Academy of Solsona where he graduated as the valedictorian. Balisacan credits his mother's aunt, Isidra Rivera, who was mayor of the town of Solsona, as his early inspiration in life. ‚ÄúShe devoted selflessly her life to this town,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúShe had actually very little physical possessions in life, especially when viewed in today‚Äôs cadre of local politicians. What she had in abundance was deep respect and love by her people, unblemished credibility and genuine concern for the poor.‚Äù When things got worse, Balisacan's eldest brother graduated from Divine Word College. Armed with an Accounting degree, Balisacan's eldest brother was offered a job in Cebu City by Atlas Mining. The job allowed his brother to bring their family to Cebu to live. Balisacan, who was an Agriculture scholar at the Mariano Marcos State University (MMSU), had to stay behind in Batac, Ilocos Norte. Read more of his early years in these featured articles, \\"Arsenio M. Balisacan: Resolute at 25\\" by Cai Ordinario, Business Mirror Anniversary Issue and \\"Top Philippine Economist to Visit Hawaii\\" by Belinda Aquino, Hawaii Filipino Chronicle. == Education == Balisacan received a B.S. degree in agriculture from the Mariano Marcos State University in 1979, graduating magna cum laude. Awarded a graduate scholarship by the Southeast Asian Regional Centre for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), he then took up a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in agricultural economics from the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os, from which he graduated in 1982. He received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1985, with the dissertation \\"A positive theory of economic protection: Agricultural Policies in Developed and Developing Countries\\".Doctoral Dissertation on Google Books Balisacan received critical support from the East-West Center (EWC) while studying at the University of Hawaii. He served as research intern from July 1982 to May 1984 and was a Joint-Doctoral Research Intern from May 1984 to September 1985 under the Resource Systems Institute of EWC. Upon earning his PhD he served as a research fellow from October 1985 to March 1986. Part of his pioneering PhD dissertation on the political economy of agricultural policy was later published in the Review of World Economics titled, ‚ÄúPublic Choice of Economic Policy: The Growth of Agricultural Protection‚Äù in 1987. He was named as one of the 100 outstanding alumni at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB), (College of Economics and Management) (CEM)‚Äôs centenary. He was conferred the 2016 Distinguished Alumni Award by the East-West Center (EWC) and East-West Center Alumni Association (EWCAA), the 2006 Distinguished Alumni Award by the UPLB Alumni Association, the 2005 Outstanding Alumni Award by the East-West Center Alumni Association Philippines, and the 2004 Most Distinguished Alumnus Award by the Mariano Marcos State University. == Professional career  Early career as economist === As Balisacan wrapped up his PhD studies at the University of Hawaii Manoa, he took up a post as a research fellow at the East-West Center in 1985‚Äì1986. He then moved to Washington D.C. in 1986 to serve as an economist for the World Bank. === Return to the Philippines as an academic === He came back to the Philippines in 1987 and became an assistant professor of economics at the University of the Philippines Los Banos until 1988, when he moved to UP Diliman and joined the faculty of the University of the Philippines School of Economics, eventually receiving an academic appointment as full professor in 1995. Balisacan was a recipient of various academic and professional awards. He was elected as academician to the National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) of the Philippines in 2008. NAST is the country's peer-elected group of select individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science and technology. As a highly respected academic, he held various positions in academic organizations and advisory groups locally and abroad. He was a member (2011‚Äì2015) of the board of academic advisors of the Chinese Center for Agricultural Policy at the Chinese Science Academy and president of the Asian Society of Agricultural Economists (2011‚Äì2014). He was chairman of the board of academic advisors of the Asian Institute of Management's Center for Bridging Societal Divides (August 2009 to 2012) and member of the policy advisory council of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (June 2009 to May 2012). Balisacan also became president of the Philippine Economic Society ‚Äì the national learned society for economists ‚Äì in 2006. He founded the Asian Journal of Agriculture and Development, an internationally refereed journal, and served as its editor in 2004‚Äì2015. He also became an adjunct professor at the Australian National University in 2011‚Äì2015. === Department of Agriculture === Seconded from UP, he served as Undersecretary for Policy and Planning at the Department of Agriculture Philippines from 2000 to 2001, also serving as Officer-in-Charge at the Agricultural Credit and Policy Council. In this capacity, he served as the Philippine chief negotiator in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agriculture Negotiations and in various bilateral agriculture negotiations. He returned to this position as Undersecretary for Policy and Planning at the Department of Agriculture for a brief stint in 2003. === SEARCA === Balisacan's abilities as an institution builder are most exemplified by what he has done to bring the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), one of the centers of excellence of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO), to new heights as it continues the journey for relevance and excellence as a development institution. Serving as the center's director and chief executive in 2003‚Äì2009, he restructured the institution to respond to the changing needs, demands, and priorities of its stakeholders, especially the need for institutional capacity-building in the region's less developed countries in the wake of globalization, environmental degradation, and global climate change. Sound financial management, coupled with innovative approaches to institutional partnerships to reach out to stakeholders, enabled the center not only to regain lost ground, but also to achieve a respectable level of financial sustainability. Indeed, the work and activities of SEARCA became visible again not only in the region it covers but also to the rest of the world. His accomplishments at SEARCA is summarized in his exit report titled, \\"Mainstreaming Agriculture in the Development Agenda\\" === UP School of Economics === Back at UP, in 2010, Balisacan was appointed dean of the School of Economics at the University of the Philippines Diliman. As dean, he concurrently served as executive director of the Philippine Center for Economic Development and chairman of the UPecon Foundation Inc. === NEDA === Balisacan held these academic posts until he was seconded from UP to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) when Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III asked him to serve as Secretary of Socioeconomic Planning. Aquino signed his appointment papers on May 10, 2012, and was confirmed by the bicameral Committee on Appointments of the Philippine Congress on February 6, 2013. As secretary of socioeconomic planning and, concurrently, director-general of NEDA, Secretary Balisacan was tasked to address the critical constraints that make economic growth slow, uneven, and exclusive to certain segments of the Philippine society. Concurrent to his role as secretary of socioeconomic planning and director-general of NEDA, he served as Board Chairman of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies and the Philippine Center for Economic Development; the first Governing Board Chairperson of the Public-Private Partnership Center of the Philippines; and the first Board Chairperson of the Philippine Statistics Authority (which combines the National Statistical Coordination Board, the National Statistics Office, the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Agricultural Statistics, the Department of Labor and Employment's Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics, and the Philippine Statistical Research Institute.) At these key positions, Secretary Balisacan was able to influence policies, programs, and projects to facilitate inclusive economic growth, employment creation, and poverty reduction. He was partly to be commended for the recent remarkable performance of the Philippine economy. In 2010 to 2016, the seven-year average growth of the Philippine economy was 6.2 percent, the country's fastest in 40 years. Recognizing the importance of maintaining the momentum, he and his senior colleagues in government work on crafting a forward-looking agenda, (Ambisyon Natin 2040), which articulated a vision for an inclusive and prosperous Philippines (See Foreword, Preface, and Chapter 1 of R. Clarete, E. Esguerra, and H. Hill, 2018, The Philippine Economy: No Longer the East Asian Exception?, Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies). Through (Executive Order No. 5), the next administration adopted the Ambisyon Natin 2040 as the long-term vision for the Philippines. The order resonates in the administration's medium-term development blueprint, the (Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022). Today, the Philippine economy remains one of the best-performing developing economies in Asia.http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/01/31/1285047/phl-economy- grows-7.2-second-fastest- asiahttp://www.philstar.com/business/2016/11/17/1644683/philippine-economy- grows-7.1-Q3-2016 === PCC === Following the passage of the Philippine Competition Act (PCA) by Congress in 2015,gov.ph President Benigno S. Aquino III formed the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) in January 2016, appointing Balisacan to serve as its first chairperson. PCC is an independent quasi-judicial body created to promote and protect market competition by prohibiting anti-competitive conduct and practices, including cartels and anti-competitive mergers. As the country's antitrust agency, PCC plays a key role in helping achieve a vibrant and inclusive economy and advancing consumer welfare. Balisacan's effective leadership, combined with a competition act that gives the enforcer broad powers, has gotten the PCC off to a good start, placing the commission among the top emerging enforcers in developing countries only two years after its formation. Nonetheless, he faces formidable challenges as competition czar because the Philippines is cited as one of the most restrictive economies in the world (see Fostering Competition in the Philippines: The Challenge of Restrictive Regulation by the World Bank). == Select books and journal publications == * Ravago, M.V. and A.M.

He has completed numerous half, three-quarter, and full 42K marathon events, both locally and abroad. His last 42K was in Paris in April 2019. He also ran in the Chicago Marathon in October 2017 and in the Honolulu Marathon in 2012. It was in Hawaii where he discovered the sport of long-distance race, three decades ago. ‚ÄúI acquired the running habit while I was working on my doctoral degree [in Economics] in Hawaii. That was in the early 1980s,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMy runs then were limited to the 10K to 21K distances. ‚ÄúI never left long-distance running [over 10K] since then, though there were several years when I skipped 42K marathons,‚Äù he says. == References == * http://opinion.inquirer.net/29657/restart * http://business.inquirer.net/70487/neda-to-review-development-plan * http://www.interaksyon.com/business/80904/with-two-years-to-go--aquino-govt- rolls-out-updated-philippine-development-plan * http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/02/18/1291651/growth-not-denting- poverty * http://www.manilatimes.net/govt-admits-failure-to-reduce- poverty/76458/ Category:Filipino economists Category:Living people Category:Directors-General of the National Economic and Development Authority of the Philippines Category:People from Ilocos Norte Category:Benigno Aquino III Administration cabinet members Category:Heads of government agencies of the Philippines Category:University of the Philippines Diliman faculty Category:University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os alumni Category:University of Hawaii at Manoa alumni Category:Duterte Administration personnel Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Arsenio Balisacan"},{"id":"35869397","text":"Alessandro Argenton (born 11 February 1937) is a former Italian equestrian who won a silver medal at the Olympic Games. ==Biography== Born Cividale del Friuli, Argenton made six appearances at the Summer Olympics. ==Olympic results== {  width=50% style=\\"font-size:90%; text- align:center;\\" - !Year !!Competition !!Venue !!Position !!Event !!Notes -  rowspan=21960  rowspan=2 align=leftOlympic Games  rowspan=2 align=left Rome   align=leftIndividual eventing  -  non-scoring  align=leftTeam eventing  -  rowspan=21964  rowspan=2 align=leftOlympic Games  rowspan=2 align=left Tokyo   align=leftIndividual eventing  -  non- scoring  align=leftTeam eventing  Italian team won the gold medal, but the medal was only awarded to top three finishers in each nation. -  rowspan=21968  rowspan=2 align=leftOlympic Games  rowspan=2 align=left Mexico City  16th  align=leftIndividual eventing  -   align=leftTeam eventing  -  rowspan=21972  rowspan=2 align=leftOlympic Games  rowspan=2 align=left Munich  bgcolor=silver2nd  align=leftIndividual eventing  -  8th  align=leftTeam eventing  -  rowspan=21976  rowspan=2 align=leftOlympic Games  rowspan=2 align=left Montreal  22nd  align=leftIndividual eventing  -  4th  align=leftTeam eventing  } ==See also== * List of athletes with the most appearances at Olympic Games ==ReferencesCategory:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Olympic equestrians of Italy Category:Italian male equestrians Category:Olympic silver medalists for Italy Category:Equestrians at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Italian event riders Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Olympics ","title":"Alessandro Argenton"},{"id":"35869406","text":"Richard A.

The daily was published between 1958 and 2013. ==History and profile== Al Nadwa was founded in 1958 in Mecca. The founder of the paper is Ahmad Al Subaii. In fact, Al Nadwa incorporated with another paper, Hera (a name of holy mountain in Islam), under its current name. The publisher of the paper was Makkah Printing and Information Establishment. Abdulaziz bin Mohieddin Khoja is the chairman of the general assembly of Makkah Establishment for Publishing and Printing. Its editor-in- chief was Ahmad bin Saleh. In 2003, the paper experienced serious financial difficulty. In February 2013, it was closed down due to unpaid financial dues. The paper was considered as pro-government. It was further described as a religiously conservative daily. The estimated circulation of the paper at the beginning of the 1990s was between 25,000 and 30,000 copies. Its 2003 circulation was 30,000 copies. Although the paper had no high circulation levels, it enjoyed a special status as a result of being Mecca's hometown paper and of having good editorial writings. The U.S. diplomatic cables also indicated that small circulation of the paper made it difficult to see its influence. ==Content== The U.S. diplomatic cables reported that Al Nadwa was the only paper condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 before the Saudi government displayed a clear official position concerning this event. Additionally, in the 1990s, a series of articles, criticising extremist views, was published in the paper. The target of these criticisms were initially non- Saudi Islamic figures such as Sudanese Hasan Al Turabi. However, later the paper began to criticise Safar Al Hawali and Ayidh Al Qarni. The criticism against these two Saudi Islamic figures led to public anger. As a result, columnist Yousuf Damanhouri was removed from the paper's board of editors. The paper, unlike many other Saudi daily papers, also reported the incident of fire in girls' school in Mecca in 2002, killing fifteen female students as a result of the muttawa's curtailing the attempts of rescue workers. Furthermore, then-editor-in-chief of the paper, Abdul Rahman Saad Alorabi, employed women reporters to interview with the women in the family of victims and surviving female students. The paper openly reported the negative physical conditions experienced in Mecca. For instance, it reported in 2007 that although Al Bayary, an old street, is in close proximity to Masjid Al Haram, it seriously suffers from lack of electricity and water facilities as well as sewerage problems. ==See also== List of newspapers in Saudi Arabia ==References== Category:1958 establishments in Saudi Arabia Category:2013 disestablishments in Saudi Arabia Category:Arabic-language newspapers Category:Defunct newspapers published in Saudi Arabia Category:Mass media in Mecca Category:Newspapers published in Saudi Arabia Category:Publications established in 1958 Category:Publications disestablished in 2013 ","title":"Al Nadwa"},{"id":"35869464","text":"Georgi Kostadinov (; born 7 September 1990) is a Bulgarian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Russian Premier League club Arsenal Tula and the Bulgarian national team. ==CareerEarly career=== Born in Tsarevo, Kostadinov began his career with Naftex Burgas.

The programmes sold to overseas broadcasters in this way covered every part of the BBC's output, including all types of music, drama, religious and children's programmes and comedy. It is now called BBC Radio International.BBC Transcription Service ‚Äì Institute of Professional Sound British Library ‚Äì BBC Radio International cataloguesBBC Radio International Whilst the BBC destroyed most broadcast recordings it produced for its various outlets, BBC Transcription Services often retained their copy and many of the surviving radio programmes from the 1940s onwards owe their survival to the fact that Transcription Services issued the material. The original releases were in the form of 12-inch 78 rpm discs. Each of these discs contained no more than three or four minutes per side and so a radio operator would have needed to cue the start of many discs as the previous one finished for a half hour programme. Consecutive parts of a programme were on different discs to enable the radio operator to cue the start of the next part of the programme from a different disc from the one being played. By around 1947, the 78 rpm discs were replaced with 16-inch transcription discs running at 33‚Öì rpm. These coarse groove discs each contained approximately ten minutes per side, so the requirement to cross fade throughout an episode was still required. As witness Ted Kendall's Technical Notes included in The Goon Show Compendium box sets, the 16-inch discs were superseded by 10-inch and later 12-inch vinyl LPs from the mid-1950s onward. These discs were edited to run to standard lengths, and to remove any content deemed too topical or potentially offensive. In the case of The Goon Show, for instance, each episode was cut to approximately 29 minutes and 30 seconds. A later reissue series of Goon Show episodes was cut further to 27 minutes to accommodate commercials. BBC Transcription Services typically pressed only one hundred copies of each disc with instructions to the overseas radio network to destroy the disc at the end of the licence period. ==References== BBC Transcription Services Category:History of broadcasting Category:History of radio ","title":"BBC Transcription Services"},{"id":"35869524","text":"Mordellistena zuuncharaensis is a beetle in the genus Mordellistena of the family Mordellidae.

She was initially signed up to a three-book deal by publishers HarperCollins following the submission of a manuscript for her first novel. To date, she has published 15 adult books and is also the author of the children's book series, Cinders and Sparks. She lives in Los Angeles, California. ==Career== Kelk was inspired to write her first book, I heart New York, after returning from a holiday to New York City to her home in London, England, and being unable to get over post-vacation blues. She immediately decided that it would be a series of books, each taking in different cities, partly inspired by her teen experience of reading the Sweet Valley High series of novels. She found an agent through a roundabout route; having sent out copies of I Heart New York to various agents and having received several rejection letters, one agent got in contact with Kelk. However, it transpired that the agent disliked the book and wanted her to work on a different project, and that she \\"would have to use a pseudonym because [her] name sounded like a cat being sick\\". Kelk decided not to sign with the agent and instead asked a friend who worked with book publisher HarperCollins to recommend one. The friend handed a copy of the book to the commercial women's fiction team, who signed her to a three-book deal. Kelk writes a blog on her website and has written for many women's magazines, including a monthly column for magazine Marie Claire. In 2009 she moved with her full-time job as a children's book editor to New York itself, something she said was following in the footsteps of the lead character from her book series. She currently works as a full-time writer. In 2017, Kelk started the beauty podcast, Full Coverage, along with co-host Harriet Hadfield, a British makeup artist and YouTuber, also based in Los Angeles.https://fullcoveragepodcast.com/ She is also one of the hosts of popular pro-wrestling podcast, Tights and Fights. After a visit to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls during a road trip in 2010, she decided to write the location into one of her books. I heart Hollywood was nominated for the People's Choice Award in the inaugural Pure Passion Awards in 2010, an awards ceremony set up by the Romantic Novelists' Association.

It was formed during the Chinese Civil War by existing members of Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army stationed in Manchuria along with others, where they fought against the Republic of China government. The army also incorporated elements of the former Manchurian occupation forces, which included around 30 thousand Japanese troops. The army was commanded by Lin Biao, and it was involved in many crucial battles including the Liaoshen Campaign. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Northeast People's Autonomous Army () was established from the Eighth Route Army that mobilized into Northeast China and local anti- Japanese guerillas. On January 14, 1946, it was renamed the Northeast Democratic United Forces (), It became the Northeast People's Liberation Army () and later the Northeast Field Army () in 1948. The 156th Division was created in November 1948 under the Regulation of the Redesignations of All Organizations and Units of the Army, issued by Central Military Commission on November 1, 1948,„Ää‰∏≠Â§ÆÂÜõÂßîÂÖ≥‰∫éÁªü‰∏ÄÂÖ®ÂÜõÁªÑÁªáÂèäÈÉ®ÈòüÁï™Âè∑ÁöÑËßÑÂÆö„Äã, http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_7254c7350100xb56.html based on the 6th Independent Division, Northeastern Field Army, PLA. After the fall of Tianjin to Communist forces on 14‚Äì15 January 1949, the Nationalist garrison in Beiping was effectively isolated. Fu Zuoyi came to the decision to negotiate a peace settlement on 21 January. In the following week, 260,000 Nationalist troops began to exit the city in anticipation of the immediate surrender. On 31 January 1949, the Fourth Field Army entered Beiping to take over the city which marked the conclusion of the Pingjin Campaign. On March 11, 1949, the Northeastern Field Army was renamed the PLA's Fourth Field Army. The army comprised the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th Corps Army, special technical troops, the Column of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the 50th and 51st Corps. William W.

A third division, the 156th, was reorganised with other smaller units and individual Korean personnel from the other three field armies into the 15th Independent Division, and was transferred to the KPA in April 1950. The 156th and 166th Divisions became the KPA's 7th and 6th Divisions respectively. On 25 October 1949, Liu Yalou was appointed as the chief of air force in the People's Liberation Army. By 11 November, the air force command was officially formed from the headquarters of the 14th bingtuan (\\"Army\\"). Also in October, after the Changsha uprising, the Kuomintang Army 1st Corps may have become the 21st Army (52nd, 53rd Corps). The Fourth Field Army fought in the Bobai Campaign (November‚ÄìDecember 1949), and on May 1, 1950, elements, including the 45th Corps, completed the Landing Operation on Hainan Island.

It covers the westerly area of the county north of Pencoed and south of Ogmore Vale. The community is sparsely populated and contains only one settlement, the small village of Heol-y-Cyw, which is located on the southerly border of the community. The majority of the community is made up of hilly terrain populated by several farm houses. It was once the site of Wern Tarw Colliery, the site of the first major coalminers' strike post-nationalisation of the coal industry. The population of the community in 2011 was 888.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000634 ==Buildings of note== The largest industry in the history of the area was the Wern Tarw Colliery. First opened in 1915 as a drift mine by Meiros Colleries, a deep pit was later added and by 1938 over 400 men were employed at the site. By 1945 the drift and pit, along with workers at the Hafod Seam, employed 700 miners. In 1951, a decision by the National Coal Board to move 87 workers to the nearby Llanharan Colliery, resulted in the first major coalminer's strike since the nationalisation of the industry. The colliery closed in 1964. A major employer in the community is Rockwool, whose factory and chimney stacks at the site of Wern Tarw dominates the area. St Paul's church, on the High Street of Heol-y-Cyw, is the largest religious building in the community. Built in 1889, after a local cottage used for services could no longer accommodate the growing congregation, the church was funded by a ¬£50 grant from the Bishop of Llandaff. The church organ, purchased second-hand in 1909 and restored in 1992, is believed to be over 150 years old. ==Sport and leisure== Coychurch higher is home to rugby union club Heol y Cyw RFC, whose ground is also used by Australian Rules team, the Bridgend Eagles. ==Notes *Map showing the community boundaries of Coychurch Higher *St Paul's Church (Parish of Llanilid w Pencoed & Heol-Y-Cyw) Category:Bridgend Category:Communities in Bridgend County Borough ","title":"Coychurch Higher"},{"id":"35869565","text":"Be-Reham is a 1980 Indian Hindi-language film directed by Raghunath Jhalani and produced by K.D.

Paleoendemism refers to species that were formerly widespread but are now restricted to a smaller area. Neoendemism refers to species that have recently arisen, such as through divergence and reproductive isolation or through hybridization and polyploidy in plants. == Etymology == The first part of the word, paleo, comes from the Greek word palai√≥s, meaning \\"ancient\\". The second part of the word, endemism is from New Latin endƒìmicus, from Greek ŒµŒΩŒ¥ŒÆŒºŒøœÇ, endƒìmos, \\"native\\". Endƒìmos is formed of en meaning \\"in\\", and dƒìmos meaning \\"the people\\". == Causes == Changes in climate are thought to be the driving force in creating endemic species, generally due to habitat loss. Regions where past climate change has been relatively stable with low extinction rates are more like to be endemic hotspots today. To qualify as hotspot, geographical areas have to have more than 0.5% of the world's plant species endemic to the region. These causes apply to both neoendemism and paleoendemism. However, paleoendemism differs as it does not require additional factors such as barriers and ecological opportunities as it does not rely on adaptive radiation like neoendemism does. It instead relies on the instability of other regions' climate, which may limit the range of a species to a more stable region, thus turning that species paleoendemic. Limited ability for dispersal is also important in the creation of endemic species. The two terms can essentially be defined as \\"cradles\\" of new species (neoendemism), or \\"museums\\" of old species (paleoendemism). === Anthropogenic causes === There are also several human related causes to paleoendemism. Anthropogenic deforestation can severely restrict a species' habitat. In countries like Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot with extreme proportions of endemism, where only 10% of the island's original forest cover is still intact, this can also lead to extinctions. Pollution, urbanization, and agricultural growth may also turn areas inhabitable for certain species, restricting their habitat in a similar way as deforestation. Human introduction of new predators, whether it be accidental or not, destabilizes ecosystems and can lead to the creation of paleoendemic species in undisturbed regions. In many cases today, paleoendemism is essentially a stepping stone into extinction, especially for those caused by anthropogenic disturbances. == Conservation efforts == Endemism as a whole is often used to measure biodiversity. While this is not entirely correct, high levels of endemism is one of the required components of a biodiversity hot spot. Conservation efforts tend to be focused around these hot spots, and as result, endemic species reap many of the benefits. This association between biodiversity and endemism also works in the opposite way, where many conservation groups tend to pick areas to focus on based on their endemism rate. == Examples == Kiwi It is not always clear whether a particular species is paleoendemic or neoendemic. For example, kiwis, which are confined to New Zealand, were cited as examples of paleoendemism, this has since been proven to be untrue. Kiwis are ratites (a group of flightless birds). Most parts of the former supercontinent Gondwana have ratites, or did have until the fairly recent past. The traditional account of ratite evolution has the group emerging in flightless form in Gondwana in the Cretaceous, then evolving in their separate directions as the continents drifted apart. More recently, it has been suggested that ratites lost the ability to fly multiple times, and the proto- kiwi developed an inability to fly after arrival in New Zealand. ‚ÄúOverwater dispersal‚Äù has been hypothesised for the arrival of the kiwis' ancestor in New Zealand. Ginkgos are a paleoendemic genus. From the Mesozoic to the mid- Cenozoic, these trees could be found throughout the world. However, today, they can only be found in Japan and China in the wild. === Paleoendemism on islands === Islands offer classic examples of paleoendemism. For this purpose, an island is an area of habitat that is suitable for an organism surrounded on all sides by habitat that is unsuitable. Islands as harbors for endemic species are explained by the Theory of Island Biogeography. However, in order to be considered a paleoendemic on an island, the species must have had a widespread distribution previously, thus eliminating newly formed islands as potential refuges of paleo-endemics.  Geographical islands  The Bermuda rock skink (Plestiodon longirostris, formerly known as Eumeces longirostris). For example, on the Canary Islands, there are a large number of relict plant species that were formerly distributed in Europe and North Africa. Of the 88 critically endangered species on the Canary Islands, many are the result of range reductions on the islands. The island of New Caledonia is also a prime example as many of the species on the island are paleoendemics. The palm species on New Caledonia grow in areas that are likely former Pleistocene refugia of lowland rainforests. Islands are also a refuge for relict lineages of animals. Bermuda has a high diversity of species and home to one species of terrestrial vertebrate, the skink Plestiodon longirostris, which is the only extant lineage of mainland North American Plestiodon lineages. The Scorpion of Montecristo (Euscorpius oglasae) from the small Italian island of the same name is likely a paleoendemic species. Glaciations during the Pleistocene are unlikely to have created land bridges between the 10.39 km2 island and the Italian mainland, isolating the species for tens of thousands of years.  Soil (edapphic) islands  Red Hills near Tuolumne Counry, CA: a serpentine grasslands. Photo by Patrick Congdon, BLM volunteer. Many soil types harbor diverse and endemic plant species. Specific soil types act as ‚Äúislands‚Äù of fertility and the distribution of these soils leads to high rates of paleo- and neoendemism. The primary example of this is serpentine soils. These soils are found in Balkan Peninsula, Turkey, Alps, Cuba, New Caledonia, the North American Appalachians, and a scattered distribution in California, Oregon, and Washington and elsewhere For example in the serpentine soil patches in the Pacific Northwest, Steptanthus glandulosus subsp. glandulosus is a paleoendemic, though the closely related members of the species complex are widely distributed.  Mountain islands  Piper's bellflower, an Olympic Mountain endemic, near Mt. Angeles Mountains can also be ‚Äúislands‚Äù and harbors of paleoendemism because species that live on mountain peaks are geographically isolated. For example, in the Maritime Alps, Saxifraga florulenta, is an endemic plant that evolved in the Late Miocene and was once widespread across the Mediterranean Basin. Additionally, Piper‚Äôs bellflower (Campanula piperi) in the Olympic Mountains in Northern Washington is suspected to be a paleoendemic because the closest related species is located over 1,000 km away. Another example is Stroganowia tiehmii which is endemic to a single mountain range in Nevada and all other members of the genus are in Central Asia. == See also == *Relict == References == Category:Endemism ","title":"Paleoendemism"},{"id":"35869622","text":"Live at the Lampie is a live album of jazz standards by English jazz vocalist Liane Carroll and Scottish jazz pianist Brian Kellock.

It received four-starred reviews in The Guardian and Jazzwise. ==Reception== In a four- starred review, Guardian reviewer John Fordham said of Live at the Lampie, \\"Since Liane Carroll can loose off a jazz-singing broadside that might touch on Betty Carter and Bobby McFerrin (with soul-vocal asides including everyone from Aretha to Stevie Wonder), and Scottish piano virtuoso Kellock has a comparable range from Fats Waller to free-improv, the potential for repetition in this duo is low. Released from her singer/pianist responsibilities, Carroll has rarely sounded more spontaneous and relaxed.\\" For The Observer, Dave Gelly said: \\"Every phrase she sings sounds unstudied, fresh and somehow inevitable. It's best to experience her in person, but this live set comes close. There's none of her equally amazing piano playing here, but it's hard to think of a better matched keyboard companion than Brian Kellock, Scotland's finest jazz pianist and probably one of the best anywhere. The recording is basic and rather dry, but it catches the interplay between them very well\\". Peter Quinn, writing in the May 2009 issue of Jazzwise, gave the album four stars and said: \\"There was never a scintilla of doubt that a meeting between Liane Carroll and Brian Kellock would produce something a little out of the ordinary, but the breathtaking scope of the duo's music-making on Live At The Lampie is jaw- dropping... Carroll spins endlessly inventive melodic lines in a vocal performance which, purely in terms of visceral excitement and fearless soloing, is unprecedented in her output\\".

These laws allowed discrimination, harassment, and murders of members within the Iraqi LGBT community. Once Iraqi independence was achieved, these laws still remained. In recent years, leaders within Iraq have spoken out about reducing sodomy laws within the country. Regardless of the reduced laws, discrimination, harassment, and murders of LGBT community members still persist. ==Ancient Mesopotamia== In the Epic of Gilgamesh, which was composed in the Mesopotamian kingdom of Sumer, the relationship between the main protagonist Gilgamesh and the character Enkidu has been seen by some to be homosexual in nature. ==Islam and medieval era== Islam became a major religion in the region following the first Arab conquest of the region in the 7th century. However, despite the prohibitory nature of Islamic doctrine against homosexuality, the presence of homosexuals in the region continued up to the present. In the early Safavid era (1501‚Äì1723), when the Safavid empire ruled Mesopotamia from 1508‚Äì1533, male houses of prostitution (amrad khane) were legally recognized and paid taxes. ==Ottoman and British rules== In 1858, the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the area of modern-day Iraq as part of Ottoman Iraq province, abolished its existing sodomy laws. The assumption of control over the three vilayets of the province by the British (as a League of Nations mandate known as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia) imposed anti-sodomy laws on the province which would remain well after independence in 1932. ==Ba'athist era== While the British-era sodomy law may have still existed in Iraq after 1932, the 1969 Penal Code enacted by the Ba'athists only prohibited sexual activity that involved adultery, incest, public acts, prostitution, deception or force or persons under the age of eighteen years. Homosexuality was not, per se, a criminal offense. From the enactment of the Penal Code of 1969 - 2001, Iraqi security forces had considerably leeway, under the penal code, to harass, jail or even execute anyone deemed to be a threat to national security or public morality. LGBT people could be harassed, jailed or blackmailed into becoming spies for the regime. No LGBT-rights organization was allowed to exist in Iraq, and laws designed to specifically discriminate against LGBT people began to appear in the 1980s. In the summer of 1993 compulsory religious education was introduced into Iraqi schools. Nightclubs accused of harboring prostitutes were closed and the constitution was amended to include the death penalty for homosexuality.http://www.atour.com/news/international/20010710l.html The Iraqi Law of Personal Status was amended in the 1980s to specifically permit a wife to divorce her husband in cases where the husband was guilty of a homosexual relationship. The practice of \\"honor killing\\" was also made legal in the family law code, which meant that LGBT people could be killed by a family member for bringing \\"shame\\" or \\"dishonor\\" to the family. When the AIDS-HIV pandemic reached Iraq in 1986, Saddam Hussein believed that the disease could be spread by casual contact, and thus ordered all Iraqis with the disease to be relocated to a special prison facility. Widespread ignorance about the disease meant that all Iraqis with hemophilia, along with homosexuals, were often suspected of carrying the disease. [Iraqi AIDS Patients Faced Confinement as Well as Pain and Death. Ian Fisher. New York Times. Oct 2003] After the war with Iran, Saddam Hussein felt the need to increase his support among Iraqis with more traditionalist Islamic social values. One of the ways that the government achieved this was through strong, and public, opposition to LGBT people. In the United Nations, the Iraqi delegation cited religion at the time as their reasoning for opposing efforts to have the international body support LGBT rights. This was part of a larger campaign to reshape Saddam Hussein's image from that of a secularist, to that of champion of traditional Islamic morality.'The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the war, losing the peace' by Ali Allawi; 'Republic of Fear' by Kanan Makiya page 215; In 1995, Saddam Hussein created a new military unit called, Fedayeen Saddam (\\"Saddam's Men of Sacrifice\\") to punish Iraqis whose behavior or life-style was deemed to be in violation traditional Islamic mores. This group operated similar to an armed Mutaween (religious police), and often staged public torture and executions of LGBT people as women who had sex outside of marriage. ‚Äì page 55 In 1999, an urban legend began to circulate that the Iraqi government banned the South Park television series, and feature film, because it depicted Saddam Hussein being involved in a homosexual relationship with Satan. While the film would not have been approved by the Iraqi censorship board, western film makers did not attempt to exhibit films in Iraq because of the economic sanctions. In 2001, the IRCC Resolution 234 of 2001 was enacted that established the death penalty for adultery, being involved with prostitution, and anyone who, \\"Commits the crime of sodomy with a male or female or who violates the honor of a male or female without his or her consent and under the threat of arm or by force in a way that the life of the victim (male or female) is threatened\\" == 2003 Occupation of Iraq == When Coalition Provisional Authority chief executive Paul Bremer took control of Iraq in 2003 he issued a series of decrees that restored the Iraqi criminal code back to its original 1969 edition, abolished the death penalty (which the newly formed Iraqi government restored in 2005), and removed most restrictions on free speech and assembly. On February 5, 2005 the IRIN issued a report titled \\"Iraq: Male homosexuality still a taboo.\\" The article stated, among other things, that \\"honor killings\\" by Iraqis against a gay family member are common and given some legal protection. The article also stated that the 2001 amendment to the criminal code stipulating the death penalty for homosexuality \\"has not been changed\\", even through Paul Bremer clearly ordered the criminal code to go back to its original 1969 edition.IRIN Middle East  Middle East  Iraq  IRAQ: Male homosexuality still a taboo  Human Rights Feature Since 2005 there have been reports that the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq's Badr Organization has been involved in death squad campaigns against LGBT Iraqi citizens, and that they are supported in these policies by the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.Direland: Shia Death Squads Target Iraqi Gays ‚Äì U.S. Indifferent New barbaric attacks, with 90 victims, are reported in the first months of 2012.Iraq was already Hell for gays, now it's even worse, in MOI Musulmani Omosessuali in Italia These reports seem to stem from a fatwa issued by Iraqi cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani stating that homosexuality and lesbianism are both \\"forbidden\\" and that they should be \\"Punished, in fact, killed.

The final was played at the Est√°dio Nacional, Oeiras, on the 20 May 2012. The final was contested between two Primeira Liga teams, Acad√©mica and Sporting CP. Acad√©mica were appearing in their fifth final, whilst Sporting CP were appearing in their 26th final. In Portugal, the final was televised live in HD on Sport TV and RTP1. En route to the final, both sides progressed through six rounds to reach the final. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis with the exception of the semi- finals which were contested over two-legs, with a match at each team's home ground. Acad√©mica defeated Sporting 1‚Äì0. Marinho's fourth-minute goal was enough for Acad√©mica to claim their second Ta√ßa de Portugal in their history after their first cup triumph came in the inaugural edition of the competition in 1939. As Acad√©mica won the cup competition, they went on to play Porto in the 2012 Superta√ßa C√¢ndido de Oliveira in August 2012. Acad√©mica would also guarantee European football were they qualified directly for the group stage of the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Europa League by winning this competition. ==Background== Acad√©mica were appearing in their fifth Ta√ßa de Portugal final. Acad√©mica had previously won one Ta√ßa de Portugal which was the inaugural cup final in 1939, and had previously lost three cup finals (1951, 1967 and 1969). Sporting CP were appearing in their twenty-sixth Ta√ßa de Portugal final. They had previously won the Ta√ßa de Portugal fifteen times (1941, 1945, 1946, 1948, 1954, 1963, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1995, 2002, 2007 and 2008), and had been beaten in the final ten times (1952, 1955, 1960, 1970, 1972, 1979, 1987, 1994, 1996 and 2000). Prior to this match, Acad√©mica de Coimbra and Sporting CP had previously met sixteen times in this competition. Acad√©mica de Coimbra had won four times whilst Sporting had won twelve. In Acad√©mica's and Sporting's entire history, both sides had met on 139 occasions, with Sporting winning 97 games, Acad√©mica winning 19 and the two drawing 23 times. The last meeting between these two sides in this competition was in the 2006‚Äì07 edition of the cup in a quarter-final tie in which Sporting defeated the Coimbra-based side 2‚Äì1. This was the first time that each side had met each other in a cup final. The last meeting between these two sides in domestic league action was on the 30 April, three weeks before their meeting at the Jamor. Sporting defeated the briosa 2‚Äì1 at the Est√°dio Jos√© Alvalade. Acad√©mica's last victory over Sporting was a league game fixture on the 6 February 2010, where the estudantes defeated the Lisbon side 2‚Äì1. ==Route to the finalAcad√©mica=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25px;\\" Round ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:125px;\\" Opponents ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px;\\" Score - !scope=row 3  Oriental (H)  1‚Äì0 - !scope=row 4  Porto (H)  3‚Äì0 - !scope=row 5  Leix√µes (A)  2‚Äì5 - !scope=row QF  Desportivo das Aves (H)  3‚Äì2 - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"  SF  Oliveirense (H)  1‚Äì0 -  Oliveirense (A)  2‚Äì2 } As a Primeira Liga team, Acad√©mica entered the 2011‚Äì12 Ta√ßa de Portugal in the third round, where they were drawn against Portuguese Second Division side Oriental at the Est√°dio Cidade de Coimbra. Acad√©mica defeated the lower league side 1‚Äì0, with a goal from central defender Markus Berger. The fourth round saw Acad√©mica pitted against cup holders Porto in a home tie. After an uneventful first half, the first goal of the game came just after the hour mark through Marinho. As the game drew to a close with Acad√©mica in the lead, Porto's manager V√≠tor Pereira brought on two attacking-minded players in James Rodr√≠guez and Kl√©ber to try to get an equalizer for the visitors. Ten minutes from the end, H√©lder Cabral skipped past Porto's Maicon on the left, who then picked out a cross for an unmarked Adrien Silva, who slotted the ball past Rafael Bracalli. Acad√©mica scored a third goal at eighty-nine minutes as √âder intercepted the ball in the center of the pitch and threaded the ball to Diogo Valente, who, one-on-one with the goalkeeper, slotted the ball to the 'keeper's left, which gave Acad√©mica a 3‚Äì0 win over a big three side. Acad√©mica were drawn to play away against Leix√µes in the fifth round, defeating the club 5‚Äì2 over 120 minutes. Acad√©mica forced extra-time after Leix√µes had held the lead for the majority of the second half. Adrien Silva scored a decisive late goal to take the game into extra- time. In extra-time, Adrien Silva, √âder and F√°bio Lu√≠s scored to grant the Briosa passage into the quarter-finals. The Briosa faced Liga de Honra side Desportivo das Aves in the quarter-finals. The match began with an early goal from √âder, which was cancelled out six minutes later as Jorge Pires equalized for Aves. Acad√©mica regained the lead just before the interval through Markus Berger. Central defender Abdoulaye Ba extended their lead in the second half before Amaury Bischoff scored a late consolation in injury time to make the final score 3‚Äì2. For the semi-finals, Acad√©mica were drawn against the lowest ranked team still active in the competition, Oliveirense of the Liga de Honra. The semi-finals were played over two legs, with the first leg taking place at the Est√°dio Cidade de Coimbra. The Estudantes defeated Oliveirense 1‚Äì0 in the first leg, after Pape Sow scored an injury time winner to clinch the narrowest of margins for the Briosa going into the second leg. The second leg at the Est√°dio Carlos Os√≥rio saw Oliveirense score first through Paulo Clemente. Their lead would be cancelled out two minutes later as Marinho equalized. On 28 minutes, Adriano would convert from the penalty sport to give Oliveirense the lead again. In the second half, Marinho would score a brace and tie the game.

They were drawn against Portuguese Second Division side Famalic√£o in an away tie. The game which took place at the Est√°dio Municipal 22 de Junho saw Sporting defeat the second division side comfortably with two goals from Dutch striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel. Fellow Primeira Liga side Braga were Sporting CP's opponents in the fourth round. The match, which took place at the Est√°dio Jos√© Alvalade, saw the lions defeat Braga 2‚Äì0. Diego Capel and Emiliano Ins√∫a scored to guarantee Sporting CP passage into the fifth round. For the fifth round, Sporting CP faced Liga de Honra side Belenenses. Just like the previous rounds, Sporting defeated their opponents comfortably with goals from Van Wolfswinkel and Stijn Schaars. The quarter-finals saw another home tie for the lions as they were drawn against Mar√≠timo. Sporting defeated the Verde-Rubros 3‚Äì0. Mar√≠timo started stronger with the first major chance of the game falling to Baba Diawara, where on 22 minutes a Mar√≠timo counterattack saw Diawara one on one with goalkeeper Rui Patr√≠cio, where his shot was parried wide. Following Mar√≠timo's strong start, Sporting would dictate possession and create several goal scoring opportunities but would be unable to convert their chances in front of goal. Both sides went in at half time level. Following the break, Sporting took the lead. Diego Capel would be played the ball on the left hand side, who picked out a cross for an on-rushing Andr√© Carrillo who would head the ball past goalkeeper Ricardo. On 60 minutes, Sporting were awarded a penalty after Mar√≠timo's Igor Rossi fouled Van Wolfswinkel in the box. Rossi would be red carded, and Van Wolfswinkel would convert from the penalty spot to double Sporting's lead. Emiliano Ins√∫a would score in the 82nd minute to score Sporting's third goal. Fellow Primeira Liga side Nacional were the opponents in the semi-finals, which were played over two legs. The first leg took place at the Est√°dio Jos√© Alvalade. Nacional would score first, as Venezuelan striker Mario Rond√≥n would score a header from a free kick to beat Rui Patr√≠cio. This would be the first time that Sporting would concede in the 2011‚Äì12 Ta√ßa de Portugal. Nacional would score again before the break, capitalizing from the momentum that the team got from their first goal. Daniel Candeias would capitalize after a √Çnderson Polga mistake to double Nacional's lead. Following the break, Andr√© Carrillo and Diego Capel would come on for Sporting to provide more attacking threat for the Lisbon side. Sporting would score on 75 minutes through Elias. Sporting would tie the game in injury time after Stijn Schaars' free kick would be drilled across the box, where a slight deflection would take the ball into the net. The second leg would see Sporting defeat the alvinegros 3‚Äì1 at the Est√°dio da Madeira. Fabi√°n Rinaudo would score first in the 12th minute. Sporting's lead would be cancelled out by Diego Barcelos in the second half. Ten minutes later, Ricky van Wolfswinkel would score Sporting's second. Jo√£o Pereira would score Sporting's third in injury time to seal the win and take the Verde-e-Brancos to the final for the first time in four years. ==MatchOfficials=== The match officials for the game were confirmed on the 16 May by the Portuguese Football Federation (PFF). Paulo Baptista of Portalegre was named as referee. This was the first time that Baptista had officiated a major final. For the final, Baptista was assisted by Jos√© Ramalho of Porto and Hern√¢ni Fernandes of Set√∫bal, while the fourth official was Tom√°s Santos of Braga. ===Team selection=== Acad√©mica went into the cup final with several players missing due to injury. For the final, Acad√©mica were missing defender Orlando and midfielders Diogo Gomes and Pape Sow. Orlando had sustained an injury at the beginning of the league season that would keep him out for the entire season. Both Diogo Gomes and Pape Sow missed the game due to sustaining injuries in the build-up to the match. Full back Reiner was an injury doubt going into the game. Initially, Acad√©mica's David Sim√£o was ineligible to play in the final due to picking a consecutive amount of yellow cards in domestic league action. His suspension, however, was later overturned, allowing him to play in the final. Pedro Emanuel's squad selection for the final saw him omit Reiner, as he did not recuperate from his injury in order to play in the final; Emanuel's lineup saw him include Jo√£o Real in the starting eleven to replace Reiner. Acad√©mica's loan signings Abdoulaye Ba, Adrien Silva and Edinho. Unlike their opponents, Sporting CP went into the cup final without any injury worries or doubts. Sporting's influential talisman Marat Izmailov recovered in time for the match after missing the last five domestic league games. Just like Acad√©mica's David Sim√£o, Sporting's Daniel Carri√ßo had his suspension overturned in order to play in the cup final. Sporting's starting lineup saw the surprise exclusion of Marat Izmailov, although he was used in the game as a substitute in the second half. ===Summary=== The cup final started with an early goal on four minutes. Acad√©mica's Marinho scored the early goal to give the briosa the advantage. The goal came about as an unmarked Diogo Valente received the ball on the left hand side and crossed the ball into the box, where the ball fell to Marinho in the six-yard box, who headed the ball past Sporting goalkeeper Rui Patr√≠cio. Marinho's header saw him capitalize from Sporting's defensive mistake, as he was picked out unmarked in the box when the cross was delivered. Following Acad√©mica's goal, Sporting began to dictate possession but found it difficult to create goal-scoring opportunities due to Acad√©mica's defensive approach. The first half ended with the advantage to estudantes. Following the break, the second half began with Sporting on the back foot following two clear-cut chances by Portuguese striker Edinho, who failed to beat Patr√≠cio one-on-one. Following these two chances, Sporting took control of the game which led to the creation of chances on goal. Their best chance of the game fell to Spanish winger Diego Capel, who could not beat Ricardo when the game was approaching its conclusion. Acad√©mica were able to close out the game and win their second-ever Ta√ßa de Portugal. ===Details=== { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK12  Ricardo - RB41  C√©dric  - CB21  Abdoulaye Ba - CB13  Jo√£o Real - LB55  H√©lder Cabral - DM50  Diogo Melo (c)   - CM10  Adrien Silva - CM22  David Sim√£o   - RW20  Marinho   - LW23  Diogo Valente - CF36  Edinho - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK1  Romuald Peiser - DF2  Jo√£o Dias - DF4  Fl√°vio Ferreira   - DF26  Nivaldo - MF18  Magique - MF19  Rui Miguel   - FW99  Danilo   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Pedro Emanuel - } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font- size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK1  Rui Patr√≠cio - RB47  Jo√£o Pereira  - CB4  √Çnderson Polga (c) - CB5  Oguchi Onyewu - LB48  Emiliano Ins√∫a   - DM8  Stijn Schaars  - CM77  Elias   - CM14  Mat√≠as Fern√°ndez   - RW18  Andr√© Carrillo - LW11  Diego Capel - CF9  Ricky van Wolfswinkel - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK12  Marcelo Boeck - DF25  Bruno Pereirinha - DF3  Daniel Carri√ßo - MF28  Andr√© Martins   - MF10  Marat Izmailov   - FW17  Jeffr√©n   - FW33  Diego Rubio - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Ricardo S√° Pinto } } {  style=\\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 20%\\" - !2011‚Äì12 Ta√ßa de Portugal Winners - Acad√©mica 2nd title } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  width=50% valign=top Match officials * Assistant referees: ** Jos√© Ramalho ** Hern√¢ni Fernandes * Fourth official: Hugo Miguel Man of the match * Marinho (Acad√©mica)  width=50% valign=top Match rules * 90 minutes * 30 minutes of extra time if necessary * Penalty shootout if scores still level * Seven named substitutes * Maximum of three substitutions } ==See also== * Ta√ßa de Portugal * 2011‚Äì12 Ta√ßa de Portugal * 2012 Superta√ßa C√¢ndido de Oliveira ==References== 2012 Category:2011‚Äì12 in Portuguese football Category:Sporting CP matches Category:Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra ‚Äì O.A.F. matches ","title":"2012 Ta√ßa de Portugal Final"},{"id":"35869713","text":"Lucena station is a disused station on the South Main Line (\\"Southrail\\") of the Philippine National Railways.

Having achieved consecutive promotions from League One and the Championship the previous two seasons, the club were looking to retain their place in the Premier League after a seven-year absence from the top flight. Southampton finished 14th in the league table, five points above the relegation zone. They also made it to the fourth round of the League Cup, and were eliminated from the FA Cup in the third round by Chelsea. In preparation for their first season back in the top flight, Southampton strengthened their squad relatively heavily during the summer transfer window, breaking the club's transfer fee record twice with the acquisitions of Burnley striker Jay Rodriguez in July and Uruguayan midfielder Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez from Bologna on deadline day. Other significant additions included Rangers midfielder Steven Davis, Japanese defender Maya Yoshida, and young full-back Nathaniel Clyne. Several players were released at the start of the campaign, while Dan Harding was the only player sold by the club, moving to Nottingham Forest in July. Norwegian centre-back Vegard Forren was signed in January 2013, although did not make an appearance during his first season at the club. Southampton began their first top-flight campaign in seven years against reigning champions Manchester City and runners-up Manchester United, and picked up only four points from their opening ten games leaving them firmly at the bottom of the table. In November and December the team's fortunes improved, and they picked up important wins over fellow strugglers to lift themselves out of the relegation zone. After Christmas the Saints went on a six-game unbeaten run, and they later picked up high-profile wins against Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea to continue to move away from the drop zone. Survival in the Premier League was confirmed on 14 May when Wigan Athletic lost to Arsenal to take the final relegation place. Southampton finished 14th in the table having won nine, drawn 14, and lost 15 of their 38 games, collecting 41 points in the process. Despite leading Southampton to back-to-back promotions in 2011 and 2012, manager Nigel Adkins was fired in January 2013, with the club in 15th place in the Premier League table, and was replaced by former Espanyol boss Mauricio Pochettino. Along with the manager, the majority of Adkins's coaching team were also dismissed, replaced by staff of Pochettino's appointment. The winner of the club's Player of the Season award was Morgan Schneiderlin, who was voted in ahead of top scorer Rickie Lambert and midfield partner Jack Cork. ==Pre-season== Southampton began their pre-season preparations on 14 July 2012 with the Markus Liebherr Memorial Cup, which this year featured fellow Premier League club Arsenal and Belgian Pro League champions Anderlecht. In the first match of the tournament, Southampton lost to Anderlecht 1‚Äì0, with the only goal coming early in the first half from striker Tom De Sutter. Arsenal won their first game against Anderlecht by the same scoreline, with a goal from young midfielder Henri Lansbury deciding the match. Southampton scored their first goal of the 2012 pre-season in their final match against Arsenal, when new signing Jay Rodriguez converted a Danny Fox cross in the 31st minute, although the lead proved short-lived when Gervinho equalised a few minutes later, causing the game to end in a tie. Despite winning the subsequent penalty shoot-out, the Saints could not overhaul the points lead of their opponents and it was Arsenal who won the second Memorial Cup and joined Athletic Bilbao on the honours list. Travelling to a French training camp later in the month, the Saints played √âtoile Carouge on 18 July and faced Evian Thonon Gaillard on 21 July. In the first match, Southampton came back from a 1‚Äì0 deficit to win 4‚Äì1, with a goal from Luke Shaw and a late hat-trick from Billy Sharp. In the second, the Saints won by a single first-half goal from Jason Puncheon. Back in England, St Mary's hosted Dutch champions Ajax on 28 July, with the visitors securing a 1‚Äì0 win with a second half goal from winger Aras √ñzbiliz. On 4 August recently relegated Wolverhampton Wanderers travelled to face Southampton, with the home side winning 2‚Äì0 thanks to goals from Billy Sharp and midfielder Jason Puncheon. Southampton travelled away for their penultimate pre-season friendly, facing Bristol City on 7 August. Jon Stead opened the scoring for the home side late in the first half with a long range goal, and the side nearly doubled their lead before the break but for a Nathaniel Clyne block in the penalty area. The second half was shared relatively evenly between the sides, and it took until stoppage time for the Saints to come back and leave the game level courtesy of striker Billy Sharp. The club's final pre-season game was played at St Mary's on 11 August against Italian club Udinese. Despite enjoying a large portion of possession throughout the game, it was the visitors who took the spoils in indulgent fashion with a 4‚Äì0 win over the Saints. Udinese went one up after 12 minutes with a long range effort from captain Antonio Di Natale, and doubled their lead another 12 minutes later with a similar long range strike from Brazilian midfielder Willians. Yet another 12 minutes later, Di Natale scored his second and the team's third to put Udinese three up at half time. Ultimately, Southampton were unable to respond, and in the 64th minute Colombian striker Luis Muriel scored Udinese's fourth to mark a disappointing end to a relatively successful pre-season campaign for Southampton. ==Premier LeagueAugust‚ÄìOctober 2012=== ;Manchester City (19 August 2012) Southampton began their first season back in the Premier League on 19 August against title holders Manchester City. The game began well for the visitors, who put a lot of pressure on City early on, before defender Jos Hooiveld gave away a penalty for a 16th-minute foul. David Silva missed the penalty, but after a period of heavy possession for the hosts the first goal was scored by striker Carlos Tevez five minutes before half time. Ten minutes into the second half Rickie Lambert was brought on as a substitute, and within three minutes he had scored the equaliser in a move involving forward Guly do Prado and young midfielder James Ward-Prowse. Southampton went ahead just under ten minutes later, when second substitute Steven Davis scored on his league debut for the club, although the lead was cut short after just four minutes by substitute striker Edin D≈æeko, and the hosts retained the lead in the 80th minute courtesy of Samir Nasri. Despite additional chances for both sides, Southampton could not equalise again and the game ended 3‚Äì2 to the reigning Premier League champions. ;Wigan Athletic (25 August 2012) In their Premier League return to St Mary's, Southampton hosted Wigan Athletic on 25 August. Despite boasting a few clear goalscoring opportunities in the first half, including an Adam Lallana shot which hit the crossbar, the Saints were unable to break the deadlock in the first period and the teams went into half time level. It was the visitors who came out in the second half firing however, as Franco Di Santo broke the deadlock six minutes after the break with a powerful shot from inside the area. With chances opening for both sides, Athletic put the game beyond the hosts in the last minute, when a defensive error gave Ivorian Arouna Kon√© the chance to end the game, leaving Southampton in the relegation zone. ;Manchester United (2 September 2012) On 2 September the Saints hosted last season's runners-up Manchester United in their third game on the season. Rickie Lambert opened the scoring for the home side with his second goal of the season in the 16th minute, heading in a Jason Puncheon cross. The lead was cancelled out just seven minutes later however, as new United signing Robin van Persie equalised. The first half ended level, and it took until the 55th minute for the deadlock to be broken, with Morgan Schneiderlin putting Southampton ahead for the second time in the match. 15 minutes later the visitors were awarded a penalty due to a foul by Jos Hooiveld on Van Persie, although it was saved by Kelvin Davis to keep Saints ahead. In the 87th minute however, Van Persie scored his second of the match to equalise for the second time, and he completed a hat-trick in stoppage time to secure United's win and subject the Saints to their third loss in three games, leaving them bottom of the table as the only club yet to have picked up a point. ;Arsenal (15 September 2012) Southampton's 6‚Äì1 loss at Arsenal is the biggest defeat of their season. Following a two-week international break, Southampton travelled to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal on 15 September. The match started poorly for the travelling Saints, as the home side went one up in the 11th minute when Jos Hooiveld deflected in Kieran Gibbs's saved shot to score an own goal. Just 20 minutes later Lukas Podolski scored a free kick following a foul on Francis Coquelin by Steven Davis, starting off a hugely negative ten-minute period for the visitors ‚Äì within four more minutes it was 3‚Äì0 to the home side when Gervinho added his name to the scoresheet, and two minutes later Nathaniel Clyne scored the second own goal of the game to put Arsenal 4‚Äì0 up. Just before the break Danny Fox scored his first goal for Southampton, taking advantage of a mistake by Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczƒôsny to give the Saints a first half consolation. Southampton started better in the second half, but could not break through the defence of the home side, who went 5‚Äì1 up after 71 minutes with Gervinho scoring his second of the match. Former Southampton winger Theo Walcott finished off the match with an 88th-minute conversion, leaving the Saints at the bottom of the table still with no points. ;Aston Villa (22 September 2012) On 22 September Southampton hosted Aston Villa, in a match which they had to win in order to avoid their worst ever start to a season. After a relatively even first half hour, it was Villa who broke the deadlock in the 36th minute when Darren Bent took advantage of a defensive error to score, putting the visitors one up going into half time. The Saints started the second half much more aggressively though, and in the 58th minute equalised courtesy of a Rickie Lambert strike. With the added momentum, Southampton went ahead five minutes later when Nathaniel Clyne scored his first goal for the club, with Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez providing the assist for the goal. Jason Puncheon put the club 3‚Äì1 up another nine minutes later, with Lambert and Ram√≠rez working together to provide the assist for the goal. Lambert scored his second of the match from the penalty spot in stoppage time, and the Saints saw the game out until the end to pick up their first points of the season and move out of the relegation zone. ;Everton (29 September 2012) The following week Southampton travelled to Goodison Park to face Everton, who had won three out of their opening five games of the season. The Saints started strongly, when Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez scored his first goal for the club in the sixth minute when he headed in Adam Lallana's corner. The visitors looked set for another goal from Jay Rodriguez a few minutes later, but it was Everton who scored next when Leon Osman equalised in the 25th minute. Southampton suffered defensive troubles throughout the rest of the first half, and within seven minutes Everton were two up courtesy of a goal from Nikica Jelaviƒá. The home side doubled their lead just six minutes later, when Jelaviƒá headed in his second goal to put Everton 3‚Äì1 up at the end of the first half. Despite a number of chances in the second period for Rickie Lambert, Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana, Southampton could not beat the Everton defence and dropped another three points and one position in the table. ;Fulham (7 October 2012) On 7 October Southampton hosted Fulham before the second international break of the season. The Saints started the game well, as defender Jos√© Fonte scored in the fourth minute with a header from Adam Lallana's corner to put the home side a goal up early. A few minutes later, right-back Frazer Richardson had to leave the game with a leg injury, and was replaced with centre-back Jos Hooiveld with Maya Yoshida moving to the right side of defence. Southampton continued to dominate the rest of the first half, with Rickie Lambert and Jason Puncheon coming close to increasing the team's lead, but the score remained 1‚Äì0 going into half time. Fulham improved after the break, and in the 69th minute the visitors equalised when Jos Hooiveld turned John Arne Riise's shot into his own goal. Rickie Lambert was taken off, which notably reduced Southampton's goal threat, and Kieran Richardson scored a second for Fulham in the 88th minute. Jos√© Fonte scored again, however, to level the match when he headed in Danny Fox's cross in the last minute of normal time, and the match ended 2‚Äì2. ;West Ham United (20 October 2012) The Premier League resumed on 20 October, when Southampton travelled to face West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground. Concern was raised by fans due to manager Nigel Adkins's decisions to include goalkeeper Artur Boruc in the team and to leave Rickie Lambert out of the team, but in the first half the Saints performed strongly and looked the more likely side to score. The half ended goalless, but within three minutes after the break the travelling side were 2‚Äì0 down to the hosts, thanks to goals from midfielder Mark Noble and captain Kevin Nolan. 15 minutes later Adam Lallana scored his first goal of the season, before Lambert and Emmanuel Mayuka came on as substitutes to bolster the attacking strength of the side. Lambert had a few quick chances, but the comeback was short-lived as Noble converted from the penalty spot after a Jos√© Fonte handball. West Ham continued the dominance when they scored a fourth just before the end courtesy of a Modibo Ma√Øga effort, and the match ended 4‚Äì1 to leave Southampton just above the relegation zone (although due to another result later in the day they dropped down to 18th). ;Tottenham Hotspur (28 October 2012) Southampton returned to St Mary's on 28 October to host Tottenham Hotspur, sitting in 19th place in the Premier League due to results the day before. The game started poorly for the Saints, as they went behind in the 15th minute to a goal from former Southampton player Gareth Bale, who headed in a Tom Huddlestone cross to put Spurs ahead. The visitors continued to take charge of the first half, with Bale receiving and creating many additional chances, many for striker Jermain Defoe, and the run of play finally culminated in a second goal for the visitors when Clint Dempsey followed up a Defoe shot in the 39th minute. After more domination by the visitors in the second half, the hosts finally pulled a goal back courtesy of Jay Rodriguez in the 66th minute, who converted a chance following a shot by Jos√© Fonte saved by Brad Friedel. Southampton continued to put pressure on Tottenham, with more chances for Lambert and Rodriguez, but it wasn't enough to bring them out of the relegation zone. ===November‚ÄìDecember 2012=== ;West Bromwich Albion (5 November 2012) On 5 November Southampton travelled to face West Bromwich Albion able to move out of the relegation zone with a win thanks to the draw between Reading and Queens Park Rangers the day before. The game started with both sides relatively evenly matched, but it was the home side who broke the deadlock nine minutes before the break courtesy of Peter Odemwingie. After half time it was the Saints who had the early chances, with Lambert hitting the crossbar as soon as the game resumed, but more defensive problems led to a second goal for the hosts, again from Odemwingie. West Brom continued to enjoy chances throughout the rest of the game, but it ended 2‚Äì0 to leave Southampton bottom of the league. ;Swansea City (10 November 2012) After two losses in a week, including elimination from the League Cup, Southampton returned to St Mary's on 10 November to host Swansea City. In a game which featured the league debut of Luke Shaw, as well as the first league game of the season for Jack Cork, the Saints dominated possession and goal- scoring chances in the first half but failed to break the deadlock before the break. After half time Southampton continued to play well, with a penalty possibility for Adam Lallana turned down ten minutes after the break, before Morgan Schneiderlin headed in a cross from Rickie Lambert to score his second goal of the season and go 1‚Äì0 up against the Welsh side. Despite more chances for the home side, however, former Saints player Nathan Dyer scored to equalise for the visitors following a mistake by goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga. The game remained 1‚Äì1, despite more chances for both sides, and due to other results the Saints moved off the bottom of the table with only their fifth point of the season. ;Queens Park Rangers (17 November 2012) The following week Southampton travelled to Loftus Road to face Queens Park Rangers, the only team lower in the table than the Saints. The game started well for the visitors, who dominated possession for the first half and enjoyed the majority of the goal-scoring opportunities and attacking play. The positive start led to a goal for Rickie Lambert in the 23rd minute, putting Southampton 1‚Äì0 up and on the way to only their second win of the season. Just before the half time break, Jason Puncheon made it 2‚Äì0 for the Saints with a solo strike beating QPR goalkeeper J√∫lio C√©sar. Early into the second half however, Southampton conceded a goal when Canadian winger Junior Hoilett took advantage of individual mistakes to bring the home side back into the game. The remainder of the second half was relatively even, with both sides having a number of chances to score, but it was Southampton who eventually scored another when Morgan Schneiderlin took a shot in the 83rd minute which was deflected in by defender Anton Ferdinand. ;Newcastle United (25 November 2012) On Sunday 25 November Southampton hosted Newcastle United in a match which saw the first return of former Saints manager Alan Pardew since his dismissal in August 2010. After half an hour of chances either way, including a Rickie Lambert free kick which hit the crossbar and a strong Jason Puncheon chance, the hosts went ahead in the 35th minute when captain Adam Lallana took advantage of a mistake by Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul to put Southampton 1‚Äì0 up. After the break the visitors increased their attacking presence, but it was Southampton who scored next when Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez took advantage of another mistake by Krul from a Jason Puncheon cross to put the home side 2‚Äì0 up in the 60th minute. The Southampton side were frustrated by a number of decisions by the officials in the match, with Ram√≠rez being denied two penalties following his goal. Puncheon also hit the post again, and Jos√© Fonte missed out on his third goal of the season thanks to the crossbar. Jay Rodriguez scored late in the game, but was offside when the ball was played to him, and 2‚Äì0 it remained for the Saints to pick up their third win of the season, including their first clean sheet, to move out of the relegation zone for the first time in over a month. ;Norwich City (28 November 2012) Norwich City after two consecutive wins, but failed to break the deadlock and drew 1‚Äì1. Three days later, the Saints hosted Norwich City looking for a third consecutive win. The game started well for the home side, who dominated possession in the early stages and broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute when Rickie Lambert converted a chance from an Adam Lallana free kick. On the stroke of half time though, Robert Snodgrass equalised for the visitors to put a dampener on the spirits of the players going into the break. In the second period Norwich came out with much more confidence, and shut Southampton out of the game for a large period, with the defence weakening quickly. Southampton and Norwich were held in the deadlock though, with the sides sharing the spoils and the hosts failing to move out of the top relegation spot again. ;Liverpool (1 December 2012) On 1 December the Saints travelled to Anfield to face Liverpool, who had lost in midweek to Tottenham Hotspur. The hosts dominated the majority of the match, although were unable to break the deadlock until Daniel Agger headed in a Glen Johnson cross just before half time. Throughout the second half Liverpool continued to enjoy goal-scoring chances, particularly for Luis Su√°rez, and it ended 1‚Äì0 with Southampton having very few chances at all to equalise. ;Reading (8 December 2012) Southampton returned to St Mary's the following week to face Reading, who sat just three points behind 18th-placed Southampton in 19th position in the table. The game started relatively evenly with a number of chances for each side, with the home side's best chance coming after half an hour when Jason Puncheon turned in a corner to score a goal then disallowed for pushing in the penalty area. Just before half time team captain Adam Lallana received an injury, and was replaced by Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez who had not started the match. After the break the Saints continued to pressure the visitors, and in the 61st minute Jason Puncheon finally broke the deadlock to put Southampton one up. More chances went the way of the Saints, including late chances for Guly do Prado and Jack Cork, and ultimately the side held on to pick up the three points and move out of the relegation zone once again. ;Sunderland (22 December 2012) After a weekend without a game due to Chelsea's FIFA Club World Cup commitments, Southampton returned to St Mary's on 22 December to face Sunderland, who sat just one position above them in the table. The game, which saw the first Premier League start for striker Emmanuel Mayuka, started quickly, but after the first ten minutes there were very few opportunities for either side to score goals and win the match. Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher scored just before half time, and the goal was enough to win the game for the visitors with very little action occurring in the second period. As Wigan Athletic had lost earlier in the day, Southampton remained just above the relegation zone, three points behind Aston Villa in 16th. ;Fulham (26 December 2012) Four days later, Southampton travelled to Craven Cottage to face Fulham in the Boxing Day fixture. The game started poorly for the Saints, who conceded after only eight minutes when Dimitar Berbatov converted from inside the six-yard box to put the hosts up by one goal. The first half saw very few additional chances for either side, and Fulham went into half time a goal to the better. The second half was relatively uneventful, until in the 85th minute Southampton were awarded a penalty due to a handball by former Saints player Chris Baird. Rickie Lambert scored the penalty, and in the last few minutes Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez also came close, but ultimately it ended 1‚Äì1. ;Stoke City (29 December 2012) For their last fixture of 2012, Southampton travelled to face Stoke City on 29 December. The game started well for the Saints, who went ahead after only ten minutes when top scorer Rickie Lambert converted a cross from Guly do Prado on the left of midfield in the injured Adam Lallana's place. Former Southampton striker Kenwyne Jones pulled one back for the hosts six minutes later, but this was cancelled out by another goal for the visitors courtesy of second striker Jay Rodriguez from a Lambert setup. Just after ten minutes later, Southampton went 3‚Äì1 up when Lambert's penalty area shot was converted into the Stoke goal by defender Andy Wilkinson, and the Saints went into the break two goals to the better. The second half saw a similar frequency of chances for each side, but it was Stoke who enjoyed the next break when Matthew Upson scored in the 67th minute after linking up with first goalscorer Jones. After 70 minutes French midfielder Steven Nzonzi was sent off for a foul on Jack Cork, although the away side made some defensive substitutions in an attempt to hold the lead to become the first side of the season to win at the Britannia Stadium; in the final minute of normal time, however, another former Southampton striker, Peter Crouch, set up Cameron Jerome to score another equaliser. Despite seven minutes of injury time being added on, Southampton could not score again, and Stoke almost clinched a winner, meaning the Saints moved back into the relegation zone with Wigan Athletic moving up to 17th. ===January‚ÄìFebruary 2013=== ;Arsenal (1 January 2013) In their first fixture of 2013, Southampton hosted Arsenal in the return leg of their 6‚Äì1 thrashing earlier in the season. From the start Arsenal played quickly to try and mount the pressure on the Saints, but the home side made it difficult for the Gunners to break through the defence and eventually broke the deadlock themselves when Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez took advantage of some weak defending to put Southampton in front. The lead was not held for long however, as just over six minutes later a Theo Walcott free kick was turned into his own net by singer Guly do Prado to bring Arsenal on level terms. After the break Southampton continued to enjoy the majority of possession, and Ram√≠rez came close to a second goal on a number of occasions, although in the end it finished 1‚Äì1 to pull Southampton out of the relegation zone going into a break from league football for the FA Cup. ;Aston Villa (12 January 2013) After a break for FA Cup and League Cup ties, Premier League matches resumed on 12 January, with Southampton travelling to Villa Park for the return leg against Aston Villa, another side looking to avoid relegation. The Saints looked to take advantage of Villa's inexperienced defence, and almost opened the scoring on a number of occasions in the opening half an hour with the dual strike force of Rickie Lambert and Jay Rodriguez, who had scored Southampton's goal in the FA Cup defeat to Chelsea. In the 33rd minute, a controversial penalty was awarded to the visitors when Rodriguez was seen to have been brought down in the area by Enda Stevens, and Lambert converted the spot kick for his ninth goal of the season to put the Saints ahead. The home side increased the pressure in the second half, with Christian Benteke almost scoring after taking advantage of an Artur Boruc parry, and Charles N'Zogbia also came close to equalising. Luke Shaw picked up an injury late on, and Nathan Baker had Villa's final chance in injury time when he hit the woodwork with a header, but ultimately Southampton held on to pick up three points and move to relative safety in 15th. ;Chelsea (16 January 2013) Just 11 days after facing them at St Mary's in the FA Cup, which they lost 5‚Äì1, Southampton travelled to Stamford Bridge to face third- placed Chelsea in their game-in-hand. In a match which saw Lambert and Ram√≠rez left on the bench, both sides were evenly matched with the Saints holding a lot of possession while the hosts enjoyed the majority of goal-scoring opportunities. Demba Ba broke the deadlock in the 25th minute, taking advantage of clumsy defending to volley home from inside the penalty area, before Eden Hazard scored a similar goal in similar circumstances to make it two on the stroke of half time. The visitors came out with much more confidence in the second period, and within two minutes of coming on in the 58th minute Rickie Lambert scored a header from a Nathaniel Clyne cross to bring Southampton back into the game. The team continued the pressure on Chelsea, and eventually scored a second when Luke Shaw crossed for Jason Puncheon to volley into the top corner, and the side held on to take a point from the match and move one away from Newcastle below them. ;Everton (21 January 2013) Southampton's home game against Everton was the first with Mauricio Pochettino in charge. The following Monday, Southampton hosted 5th- placed Everton in the return leg of their 3‚Äì1 loss at Goodison Park, for the first match with manager Mauricio Pochettino in charge. The Saints started positively from the beginning of the game, creating numerous chances for the returning Rickie Lambert with Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez, having recently returned from injury, also taking part in many attacking moves early on. In the 20th minute Lambert hit the crossbar with a free kick, and later in the first half had a headed effort cleared off the line by striker Nikica Jelaviƒá. In the second half the visitors enjoyed more of the action, with midfielder Marouane Fellaini coming close twice early after the break. Artur Boruc made a number of key saves later in the game, and despite having a high number of corners Southampton could not break the deadlock and the match ended 0‚Äì0. ;Manchester United (30 January 2013) After a break for the FA Cup fourth round matches, during which time the squad travelled to Barcelona for training, Southampton travelled to Old Trafford to face league leaders Manchester United on 30 January 2013. The game started positively for the visitors, as Jay Rodriguez scored after just two minutes following a poor pass back by Michael Carrick to goalkeeper David de Gea. Just six minutes later, however, Wayne Rooney equalised, and Shinji Kagawa almost made it two in the tenth minute when he hit the post. In the 27th minute, Rooney scored the second for the home side as he tapped in a header by Patrice Evra from a Robin van Persie free kick awarded for a foul on Phil Jones by Rodriguez. In the second half, Van Persie came close to a headed goal but for an impressive Artur Boruc save, and he also had a goal disallowed for offside. Despite the majority of the possession in the second half, the Saints were unable to make any of their chances count, and suffered their first league defeat since 22 December 2012 to remain 16th in the table. ;Wigan Athletic (2 February 2013) On 2 February Southampton travelled to the DW Stadium to face fellow relegation possibilities Wigan Athletic, who earlier in the season had beaten the Saints 2‚Äì0. The early minutes of the game were noticeably scrappy, with both sides fighting for possession in the middle of the field, and it was Wigan who had the first chance when an early effort from Franco Di Santo was saved by Artur Boruc, before Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez volleyed over the bar from inside the penalty area at the other end. The home side broke the deadlock later on in the half, when captain Gary Caldwell headed in a corner to put his side one up going into the break. In the second half the Saints largely outplayed the hosts, and eventually on-form striker Rickie Lambert equalised when he headed in Jay Rodriguez's knock-on from Jack Cork's cross in the 64th minute. Substitute Adam Lallana then hit the post, and Lambert saw a volley trickle wide, before Morgan Schneiderlin scored in the last ten minutes to all but seal the victory for Southampton. In the last minute of normal time, however, Gary Maloney touched the ball into Southampton's goal to share the spoils between the teams. ;Manchester City (9 February 2013) Back at St Mary's the following week, the Saints hosted current champions Manchester City in the return game of the opening match of the season. The game began relatively quickly, and within seven minutes the hosts had scored as Jason Puncheon took advantage of a mistake by Gareth Barry to cross in for Jay Rodriguez; the effort was saved, but Puncheon followed it up from the edge of the area to put Southampton 1‚Äì0 up. The home side continued the pressure on the visitors, and in the 22nd minute Steven Davis made it two when Joe Hart failed to catch a shot from Rickie Lambert with the midfielder running into the box for the tap-in. Rodriguez almost scored a third for Southampton, volleying narrowly wide, but City replied before the break with a counter-attack goal from Edin D≈æeko set up by Pablo Zabaleta. The half ended with a strong penalty call for Southampton, and after the break the Saints continued to play for a third goal; it came quickly, as Barry's bad fortunes continued when he turned Lambert's cross into his own net despite very little pressure on the ball to make it 3‚Äì1 to the 16th-placed side. Despite a change in personnel and tactics, City were unable to get back into the game in a meaningful way, giving Southampton their first win since 12 January to move up to 15th. ;Newcastle United (24 February 2013) After another break, Southampton travelled to face fellow strugglers Newcastle United on 24 February. The game started well for the Saints, as Morgan Schneiderlin opened the scoring within three minutes with a half volley into the bottom corner from a Rickie Lambert cross knockdown. The hosts quickly increased the pace of their play though, and after several chances they scored half an hour later when Moussa Sissoko converted a saved Yoan Gouffran chance to equalise. Just before half time they made it two, as Papiss Ciss√© scored a long range goal to put Newcastle 2‚Äì1 up going into the break. Southampton came out dominating in the second period, with Lambert picking up his 100th goal for the club when he turned in an Adam Lallana cross from the right wing. Danny Fox and Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez came on for Luke Shaw and Steven Davis later on, and it was the defender who gave away a penalty for handball which was converted by Yohan Cabaye in the 67th minute. The Saints attempted to get back into the match, but the result was confirmed when an attempted clearance by Fox went into his own net off Jos Hooiveld, meaning the team dropped from 15th to 16th in the table. ===March‚ÄìMay 2013=== Southampton's loss to Queens Park Rangers in March was their second in a row. ;Queens Park Rangers (2 March 2013) On 2 March, Southampton hosted bottom- placed Queens Park Rangers, in a match which saw competing managers Mauricio Pochettino and former Saints manager Harry Redknapp share their birthday. Southampton got off to a strong start, enjoying the majority of chances for the opening minutes, but it was QPR who broke the deadlock with their first shot on goal in the 14th minute courtesy of a Lo√Øc R√©my strike. A scrappy first half continued on, with the home side unable to equalise until the very end of the first period when QPR goalkeeper J√∫lio C√©sar parried a shot from substitute Jay Rodriguez into the path of Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez, who chipped the ball into the net for 1‚Äì1. The second period started equally scrappily, with the hosts pulling out in front early on when both Jos√© Fonte and Rodriguez came close to putting the Saints ahead in the opening action. Shaky defending from substitute left-back Luke Shaw and centre-back Maya Yoshida led to the visitors' second (and winning) goal, when Park Ji-sung crossed the ball in for a Jay Bothroyd tap-in past Artur Boruc. Robert Green replaced the injured J√∫lio C√©sar late on, and the move came good when he made an athletic save to deny Yoshida in the last few minutes, giving QPR only their third win of the season and leaving Saints in the relegation mix. ;Norwich City (9 March 2013) The following week Southampton travelled to Carrow Road to play Norwich City. Southampton were arguably the more likely to score early on in the game, with attacking players Adam Lallana, Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez, Jay Rodriguez and Rickie Lambert all enjoying first-half chances, and City goalkeeper Mark Bunn played his part in denying the visitors. Robert Snodgrass, Grant Holt and Michael Turner all had chances for the hosts, but it was the final minute in which the game really took shape ‚Äì Southampton defender Luke Shaw was penalised for a challenge on Norwich striker Grant Holt, and City were awarded a controversial penalty. Ultimately Artur Boruc saved the penalty, meaning the points were shared between the teams, although due to the reaction by their players after the penalty decision Southampton were fined by The Football Association for \\"failing to control their players\\". ;Liverpool (16 March 2013) On 16 March Southampton hosted Liverpool, and after a shaky start the home side went ahead through Morgan Schneiderlin's fifth goal of the season, converting a Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez cross headed down into the penalty area by Jay Rodriguez. The Saints dominated most of the first half, with chances for more goals falling to Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Rodriguez within the opening 20 minutes of play; Lambert eventually did put his side 2‚Äì0 up, with a free kick deflecting off the Liverpool wall to beat Brad Jones. Former Southampton target Philippe Coutinho was the main threat from the visiting side, and after being denied by Artur Boruc in the 40th minute he brought his side back into the game on the stroke of half time. The second half was much more scrappy, with Liverpool edging Saints out and forcing them into defensive errors, but late on in the game it was Rodriguez who scored the fourth and final goal of the game, running almost half the pitch and converting a deflection off Jones to win the game for Southampton in front of a season record attendance of 32,070. ;Chelsea (30 March 2013) Following the final two-week international break, Southampton returned to St Mary's on 30 March to face Chelsea for the third time in the season, ahead of the visitors' FA Cup replay just two days later. Despite a number of key injuries, including captain Adam Lallana and playmaker Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez, Southampton started the game at a high tempo, with Jay Rodriguez coming close early on after a long run through the Chelsea defence. Rodriguez eventually did open the scoring for the hosts in the 23rd minute, linking up well with Steven Davis to slot calmly past Petr ƒåech to put the Saints ahead. Ten minutes later John Terry equalised with a header from a corner, although the hope for the visiting side did not last long as a Rickie Lambert free kick on his 500th career league appearance just two minutes later put the home side back in the lead going into half time. Goalkeeper Artur Boruc was taken off at the break and replaced by Kelvin Davis, who later made a number of key saves to deny Chelsea from coming back into the match. Despite high pressure from the visitors towards the end of the game, Southampton held on and moved up to 12th in the table following Everton's win later in the day. ;Reading (6 April 2013) After two wins in a row, and the club in 12th place in the Premier League, Southampton travelled to face Championship title holders Reading, in a game which saw the Saints face old manager Nigel Adkins for the first time since his sacking. The game started badly for the travelling side, who defended poorly to almost allow Adam le Fondre to open the scoring, although it was Southampton who broke the deadlock through Jay Rodriguez's sixth league goal of the season, and his third in three consecutive games. Southampton continued pressuring the home side throughout the rest of the first half, with Rodriguez coming close to netting a second but hitting the bar and Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez missing an opportunity. After the break the visitors came out stronger, although many chances were missed and the hosts began to take the advantage; Adam Lallana replaced Ram√≠rez in the 63rd minute though, and within ten minutes had scored Southampton's second. A controversial Artur Boruc save denied Reading a consolation, and despite added pressure Southampton held on to record a third consecutive victory in the top flight for the first time since December 2003, and move up to 11th. ;West Ham United (13 April 2013) With the club in 11th place in the league table, Southampton hosted West Ham United just a position below them on equal points on 13 April. The game was a largely scrappy affair in difficult weather conditions, and both the home side and the away side enjoyed early chances ‚Äì a shot by Rickie Lambert from a corner was deflected onto the post by United goalkeeper Jussi J√§√§skel√§inen, and winger Ricardo Vaz T√™ was denied by the crossbar. Just before the hour mark, however, the Saints finally broke the deadlock when Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez found himself free of the West Ham defence and, on the second attempt, slotted the ball into the visitors' net. The lead was sacrificed just seven minutes later, as a Jos Hooiveld-conceded free kick was scored scrappily by Andy Carroll to put the Hammers in with a chance of points. Jay Rodriguez and Jason Puncheon were introduced later in the match, which helped the home side, but it was not enough to overcome a resilient West Ham side and obtain all three points. ;Swansea City (20 April 2013) The following week Southampton travelled to face Swansea City, still in the top half of the table. The hosts started the stronger of the two sides, with √Ängel Rangel and Jonathan de Guzm√°n coming close early on, with Jack Cork and Jay Rodriguez responding for the visiting Saints and forcing saves from Swansea goalkeeper Michel Vorm. Rickie Lambert came close to scoring with a free kick, and from the resulting corner Adam Lallana converted into the Swansea net but the goal was disallowed for a foul on Vorm by the Southampton captain. Both sides enjoyed decent chances throughout the second half, and substitute Emmanuel Mayuka came close to winning it in the closing minutes but for a reflex save from in-form Vorm; the game ended goalless, extending Southampton's unbeaten run to six matches. ;West Bromwich Albion (27 April 2013) On 27 April Southampton hosted a West Brom side which had not won since 9 March. The game started relatively well for the home side, who dominated possession and had chances to score first within the opening few exchanges, but it was the visitors who opened against the run of play in the sixth minute when Marc-Antoine Fortun√© turned in a corner on the third attempt to give the Baggies an early advantage. For Southampton the standout player was Jay Rodriguez, who took a number of opportunities to shoot but only hit the target a few times, although West Brom had their fair share of chances too (many involving Chelsea loanee Romelu Lukaku) in a largely cagey and scrappy opening 45 minutes. Gast√≥n Ram√≠rez came on at half time and was involved in a few early attacks for the hosts, but 25 minutes into the second half (after Lukaku had taken advantage of defensive errors to double his team's lead) he was sent off for an incident involving Fortun√© following an alleged elbow on Shane Long, which also saw the West Brom goalscorer dismissed. Long later scored a third for the visitors, before referee Robert Madley ‚Äì in charge of his first game in the Premier League ‚Äì gave Danny Fox his second booking of the game and Southampton's second red card of the game (and of the season) to leave them with nine-men for the last ten minutes; due to other results, Southampton only dropped one place in the league table. ;Tottenham Hotspur (4 May 2013) The following week Southampton travelled to White Hart Lane to face European hopefuls Tottenham Hotspur. With kick-off delayed by half an hour due to an issue on the local motorway, the travelling side took the early initiative with Rickie Lambert coming close after latching onto a lofted ball by Nathaniel Clyne; Lambert came close again minutes later, as he saw a close-range free kick pushed by Hugo Lloris onto the post, and Steven Davis could not convert the follow-up. After the break the Saints continued to enjoy the majority of scoring opportunities, with a notable chance for Adam Lallana going astray, followed by a period of dominance for the hosts in which Clint Dempsey and Tom Huddlestone came close. In the final five minutes though, recently named PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year and former Southampton player Gareth Bale scored his second in two against his old club when he broke away from Luke Shaw and fired a shot into the top corner of Southampton's net, subjecting them to a second defeat in a row. After their final game of the season, against Stoke City, the Southampton players completed a lap of honour at St Mary's Stadium to thank the fans for their support throughout the year. ;Sunderland (12 May 2013) Southampton travelled to the Stadium of Light for their penultimate game of the season, facing a Sunderland side just one point and one place below them in the bottom quadrant of the league table. Once again the Saints dominated early possession and chances, although they lacked an end product with Rickie Lambert often found offside and surrounding players in poor form in the opposition half; it took until 27 minute for Sunderland to have the first actual chance of the game, which ended with a harmless shot at Artur Boruc. Into the second half the game continued on level terms, with Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet performing well against the attacks of the visitors, and it was the home side who took advantage on 68 minutes when full-back Phil Bardsley made a run into the Southampton half and drove a shot in from outside the box. The Saints responded quickly however, as both substitute midfielders James Ward-Prowse and Jason Puncheon linked up well to equalise for Pochettino's side eight minutes later. Lambert had a chance to win it for the visitors, but in the end the game finished 1‚Äì1 which meant Southampton were almost entirely safe in the Premier League, but for an unlikely run of results in the final matches of the season. ;Stoke City (19 May 2013) Southampton's final game of the season was at home to Stoke City, which was also the final career match of striker Michael Owen. The home side began the game strongly, with season top scorer Rickie Lambert scoring within the first minute only for the goal to be disallowed for offside. The remainder of the first half saw few chances for either side, but it was Stoke who struck first after the break when former Saints striker Peter Crouch headed in a cross from Geoff Cameron to put the Potters one up. In response, Steven Davis and Morgan Schneiderlin came close to scoring an equaliser but for the performance of Asmir Begoviƒá in goal, and ten minutes after the opener Lambert made it 15 for the season with a tap-in from close range. The scores remained level and it left Southampton in 14th place for their first season back in the Premier League. ===Results and table=== {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" width=\\"45%\\" !width=\\"30\\" !Club !width=\\"30\\" !width=\\"30\\" !width=\\"30\\" !width=\\"30\\" !width=\\"30\\" !width=\\"30\\" !width=\\"30\\" !width=\\"30\\" - 12align=\\"left\\"Fulham 381110175060‚Äì1043 - 13align=\\"left\\"Stoke City 38915143445‚Äì1142 - 14align=\\"left\\"Southampton 38914154960‚Äì1141 - 15align=\\"left\\"Aston Villa 381011174769‚Äì2241 - 16align=\\"left\\"Newcastle United 38118194568‚Äì2341 } Pld = Matches played; W = Matches won; D = Matches drawn; L = Matches lost; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; GD = Goal difference; Pts = Points ==FA Cup== On 5 January 2013, Southampton hosted FA Cup holders Chelsea in the Third Round of the tournament. The Saints started strongly in the first half, breaking the deadlock in the 22nd minute courtesy of a Jay Rodriguez strike set up by Jason Puncheon, but could not hold the lead until the break as Chelsea striker Demba Ba scored on his debut just over ten minutes later, before Victor Moses scored the away side's second on the stroke of half time. Shortly after the break the hosts conceded again when Branislav Ivanoviƒá headed in a Juan Mata cross, and Ba made it 4‚Äì1 for the reigning champions on the hour mark. In the last ten minutes Chelsea were awarded a penalty for a handball by Steven Davis, and substitute captain Frank Lampard converted confidently to seal a 5‚Äì1 win at St Mary's, knocking Southampton out of the competition. ==League Cup== ;Stevenage (28 August 2012) On 28 August 2012, Southampton travelled to play Stevenage in the second round of the 2012‚Äì13 Football League Cup. After a relatively even and incident-free first half, the Saints came out firing after the break as returning striker Tadanari Lee scored his first goal of the season to put the visitors one up. Billy Sharp, who provided the assist for the first goal, got on the scoresheet himself 20 minutes later with Southampton's second, before winger Jason Puncheon scored a third two minutes later from outside the penalty area. Among a number of young players coming on as substitutes late in the game, Ben Reeves scored on his season debut in the third minute of injury time to seal the win for the Saints, with the home side picking up a consolation goal to leave the score at 4‚Äì1. ;Sheffield Wednesday (25 September 2012) Southampton's third round draw saw the club host Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on 25 September. After half an hour of pressure from both sides, Jay Rodriguez scored his first goal for the Saints with a shot from the edge of the penalty area to put the hosts ahead. Following a number of additional chances for Southampton to go two up, the sides went into half time at 1‚Äì0. Despite a number of clear cut chances in the second half, it took until the 78th minute for Rodriguez to double Southampton's lead when he converted a penalty following a foul on winger Steve De Ridder. Wednesday increased the pressure in the final part of the match, but were unable to reverse Southampton's win. ;Leeds United (30 October 2012) For the fourth round of the cup, Southampton were drawn in an away match against Championship side Leeds United for 30 October. The home side held the majority of the possession and enjoyed more chances than the visitors in the first half, and opened the scoring in the 34th minute courtesy of loanee midfielder Michael Tonge. The second half continued in much the same way, with Leeds boasting more of the few chances, before El Hadji Diouf finally secured the victory for the hosts with an 88th-minute goal. In the last minute Leeds were also awarded a penalty, which was scored by substitute striker Luciano Becchio. ==Squad statistics== {  style=\\"width:84%; font- size:95%;\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"3%\\"No. !rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"3%\\"Pos. !rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"3%\\"Nat. !rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"12%\\"Name !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"3\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"3\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"3\\"Total !colspan=\\"2\\"Discipline -

She had a pietistic upbringing according to the principles Philip Jacob Spener. In 1721, at the wedding of her brother, Henry XXIX, she met his friend Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Exactly one year later, she married him. The marriage was described as combative, based on a mutual decision to strive for mutual goals, rather than convenience or love. They had twelve children, among them, Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf. Erdmuthe, who had learned from her mother how to administer a county, took over the business of managing her husband's possessions in Berthelsdorf and the newly founded settlement of Herrnhut. In the Moravian Church, she ran the orphanage, in addition to raising her own twelve children. After her husband's first expulsion in 1732, he transferred his possessions to her. She toured several European countries together with her husband and during his eleven years of exile, she administered his assets and managed the Moravian Church. In 1755 her husband returned from exile in London. They had grown apart during his exile, and lived separately after his return: he resided at his castle in Berthelsdorf; she lived in Herrnhut. After the death of her last son, Christian Renatus, her health began failing. == Legacy == Erdmuthe Dorothea wrote a number of hymns and initiated the annual publication Daily Watchwords. == References  Bibliography == * Erika Geiger: Erdmuth Dorothea Gr√§fin von Zinzendorf, SCM H√§nssler, 3rd ed., Holzgerlingen, 2009, * Wilhelm Jannasch: Erdmuthe Dorothea Gr√§fin von Zinzendorf, geborene Gr√§fin Reuss zu Plauen, ihr Leben als Beitrag zur Geschichte des Pietismus und der Br√ºdergemeine dargestellt, Verein f√ºr Br√ºdergeschichte, Herrnhut and Unit√§tsbuchhandlung, Gnadau; also in: Zeitschrift f√ºr Br√ºdergeschichte, vol. 8, 1914; also: thesis, Heidelberg, 1914 * == External links == * * * https://web.archive.org/web/20070607042610/http://www.uni- ulm.de/LiLL/3.0/D/frauen/biografien/Jh18/zinzendorf.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20130127034800/http://ekd.de/aktuell/48974.html * Die Gr√§fin in der Republik Gottes in: Sonntagsblatt, 18 June 2006 Category:Christian hymnwriters Category:Moravian Church Category:House of Reuss Category:German countesses Category:1700 births Category:1756 deaths Category:18th-century German people ","title":"Erdmuthe Dorothea of Reuss-Ebersdorf"},{"id":"35869801","text":"Bigamy () is a 1927 German silent drama film directed by Jaap Speyer and starring Heinrich George, Maria Jacobini, and Anita Dorris. ==CastPlot== Plumber Otto Engel has been abandoned by his wife Ada.

He attended high school in Kragujevac and determined early that his destiny was in historical research, education and record-keeping. He attended the Grandes √©coles, today's University of Belgrade, from which he earned a bachelor's degree in 1890. Upon completion of his studies, he taught in Krusevac and Kragujevac, between 1890 and 1894. From 1894 and 1896 he lived in France and Italy where he pursued further studies in library science and professional training as an educator. His experiences abroad were put to good use when he was a professor at the Teacher's Training College in Aleksinac and the First Belgrade Gymnasium. From 1903 to 1927 he was the director of the National Library of Serbia. During his time as director the First World War brought a lot of misfortune to the library. The bombing destroyed a part of its holdings, and the remaining collections were moved for safety to several different places in Belgrade, Ni≈° and Kosovska Mitrovica. A part of the collections ended up in Sofia (Bulgaria), but was returned after the war. A lot of the library materials, manuscripts, books and newspapers disappeared. Thanks to Jovan Tomiƒá's public activity, the reconstruction of the library holdings began during the war and was intensified after the war. ==Selected works== Tomiƒá has published 60 books, and more than 40 learned articles and dissertations, a lot of criticism, reports and polemics.

Homosexuality has been viewed as a sin in Islam, and is outlawed in almost all Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. In pre-Islamic Iran, a tradition of homosexuality existed, and most were tolerant of sexual activity among men, with the exception of the Zoroastrians. In fact, most were tolerant of homosexuality until the Iranian Revolution of 1979. With the new government, as many as 7,000 homosexuals were hanged, shot, stoned, or burnt to death. Since the revolution, the punishment for homosexuality has been based on Sharia law, with the maximum penalty being death. Transgender people have never been officially addressed by the government leading up to the 1979 revolution, but beginning in the mid-1980s, sex reassignment surgery has been allowed, and the government provides up to half the cost of the procedure for those needing financial assistance. == Pre-Islamic period == Ancient Iranian society had a tradition of polytheism and pederasty, which came into sharp conflict during the Achaemenid period. Iranian pederasty and its origins were debated even in ancient times ‚Äì for example, Herodotus claimed they had learned it from the Greeks: \\"From the Greeks they have learned to lie with boys.\\"David Grene, Herodotus, p.156, 1987 However, Plutarch asserts that the Iranians used eunuch boys to that end long before contact between the cultures. Gebundene Ausgabe, Plutarch: Malice of Herodotos (Aris & Phillips Classical Texts), 1992 In either case, Plato claimed they saw fit to forbid it to the inhabitants of the lands they occupied, since \\"It does not suit the rulers that their subjects should think noble thoughts, nor that they should form the strong friendships and attachments which these activities, and in particular love, tend to produce.\\"Tom Griffith (Translator), Symposium of Plato, 1993, p112 Sextus Empiricus writing in his \\"Outlines of Scepticism\\" (circa C.E 200) asserted that the laws of the Persians were tolerant of homosexual behaviour, and the men \\"indulge in intercourse with males\\" (1:152)Julia Annas (ed), Sextus Empiricus: Outlines of Scepticism, University of Cambridge Press, 2000, p76 Around 250 BCE, during the Parthian Empire, the Zoroastrian text, the Vendidad, was written. It contains provisions that are part of sexual code promoting procreative sexuality that is interpreted to prohibit same-sex intercourse as a form of demon worship, and thus sinful. Ancient commentary on this passage suggests that those engaging in sodomy could be killed without permission from the Dastur. However, a strong homosexual tradition in Iran is attested to by Greek historians from the 5th century onward, and so the prohibition apparently had little effect on Iranian attitudes or sexual behavior outside the ranks of devout Zoroastrians in rural eastern Iran. == Islamic period == Shah Abbas of Iran with a page (1627). Safavid Persian miniature from 1660 of two males engaging in anal sex Safavid Iran, 1720 There is a significant amount of literature in Persian that explicitly illustrates the ancient existence of homosexuality among Iranians. In Persian poetry, references to sexual love can be found in addition to those of spiritual/religious love. More ghazals (love poems) and texts in Saadi's Bustan and Gulistan portray love between males than between male and female. In some poems, Sa'di's beloved is a young man, not a beautiful woman.\\" European travelers remarked on the taste that Shah Abbas of Iran (1588‚Äì1629) had for wine and festivities, but also for charming pages and cup bearers. A painting by Riza Abbasi with homo-erotic qualities shows the ruler enjoying such delights.Welch A., \\"Worldly and Otherworldly Love in Safavi Painting\\", Persian Painting from the Mongols to the Qajars, √âditions R. Hillenbrand, Londres, 2000, p. 303 et p. 309. == 20th century Iran == In 1914, Magnus Hirschfeld wrote that \\"sodomy, tribadism\\" was punishable with capital punishment under the Sublime State of Persia under \\"Shiite religious laws\\", however in the case of women, this only applied with the fourth convictions, the other previous three convictions received 100 lashes. Although he also stated that \\"In recent years, the religious penal code has been implemented very negligently in practice. No one at the German embassy has heard about a conviction as a result of the crime in question.\\"Hirschfeld, Magnus. Die Homosexualit√§t Des Mannes Und Des Weibes. Berlin: L. Marcus, 1914. Print. Under the rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last monarch of the Pahlavi Dynasty, homosexuality was tolerated, even to the point of allowing news coverage of a same-sex wedding. In the late 1970s, some Iranians even began to talk about starting up a gay rights organization, similar to the Gay Liberation movement. Until the revolution, there were some night clubs in which gay behavior was tolerated. During the Shah's time, however, homosexuality was still taboo everywhere, and often one could not turn to family or friends for support and guidance. There were no public agencies to assist youth or people who were confused or questioning their sexuality: Janet Afary has argued that the 1979 revolution was partly motivated by moral outrage against the Shah's regime, and in particular against a mock same-sex wedding between two young men with ties to the court. She says that this explains the virulence of the anti-homosexual oppression in Iran. == Islamic Republic of Iran == After the creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, thousands of people were executed in public, including homosexuals. On September 12, 1979, Oriana Fallaci, Italian journalist, interviewed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. She asked him if it was right to shoot homosexuals. He responded that some societies \\"where men are permitted to give themselves to satisfy other men's desires\\", and that \\"the society that we want to build does not permit such things. When she responded about the \\"boy they shot yesterday, for sodomy.\\", he responded \\"Corruption, corruption. We have to eliminate corruption.\\" A 1987 report of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights estimated that as many as 7,000 people were shot, hanged, stoned or burned to death after the 1979 revolution.Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 89, the Unwavering Iranian Spiritual LeaderAn Interview With KHOMEINI The new religious government that came to be established after the 1979 Iranian Revolution classed transsexuals and transvestites with gays and lesbians, who were condemned by Islam and faced the punishment of lashing and death under Iran's penal code. In 1986, transsexuals were re-classified as being \\"heterosexual\\". Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, the legal code has been based on Islamic Shari'a law. All sexual relations that occur outside a traditional, heterosexual marriage (i.e. sodomy or adultery) are illegal and no legal distinction is made between consensual or non-consensual sodomy. Homosexual relations that occur between consenting adults in private are a crime and carry a maximum punishment of death (though not generally implemented) Forced homosexual relations (rape) often results in execution. The death penalty is legal for those above 18, and if a murder was committed, legal at the age of 15. (see Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni whose ages were raised to 19 in court transcripts). Approved by the Iranian Parliament on July 30, 1991, and finally ratified by the Guardian Council on November 28, 1991, articles 108 through 140 distinctly talk about homosexuality and its punishments in detail: On September 24, 2007, while speaking at Columbia University, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said, in answer to the question \\"Iranian women are now denied basic human rights and your government has imposed draconian punishments including execution on Iranian citizens who are homosexuals. Why are you doing those things?\\", \\"We don't have homosexuals, like in your country. I don't know who told you that.\\"Ahmadinejad speaks; outrage and controversy follow ‚Äì CNN.com An aide later said that he was misquoted and was actually saying that \\"compared to American society, we don't have many homosexuals\\". The aide further clarified that \\"because of historical, religious and cultural differences homosexuality is less common in Iran and the Islamic world than in the West\\". A book on this topic is Women with mustaches and men without beards: gender and sexual anxieties of Iranian modernity by Afsaneh Najmabadi. === Transgender rights === One early campaigner for transsexual rights is Maryam Hatoon Molkara, who was formerly male and known as Fereydoon. Before the revolution, she had longed to become physically female but could not afford surgery. Furthermore, she wanted religious authorization. Since 1975, she had been writing letters to Ayatollah Khomeini, who was to become the leader of the revolution and was in exile. After the revolution, she was fired, forcedly injected with male hormone, and institutionalized. She was later released with help from her connection, and she kept lobbying many other leaders. Later she went to see Khomeini, who had returned to Iran. At first she was stopped and beaten by his guards, but eventually, Khomeini gave her a letter to authorize her sex reassignment operation. The letter is later known as the fatwa that authorizes such operations in Iran.Robert Tait, A fatwa for transsexuals , and a similar article on The Guardian.

The earliest such recorded example might be that of King Hyegong, the 36th ruler of the Silla Dynasty who was killed at the age of 22 by his noblemen who revolted in protest of his \\"femininity\\".see also \\"Hyegong-wang\\" (ÊÉ†ÊÅ≠Áéã) in Samguk Sagi Silla Bon-gi King Mokjong (980-1009) and King Gongmin (1325‚Äì1374) of Goryeo are both on record as having kept several wonchung (\\"male lovers\\") in their courts as ‚Äúlittle-brother attendants‚Äù (chajewhi) who served as sexual partners. After the death of his wife, King Gongmin even went so far as to create a ministry whose sole purpose was to seek out and recruit young men from all over the country to serve in his court. By contrast, Royal Noble Consort Sun, second consort to the then Joseon crown prince, was ejected from the palace and demoted to commoner status for having had sexual relations with one of her ladies maids. Hwarang was the most overt form of same-sex relationships in ancient Korea. The sexual prowess of the hwarang were recorded in the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms, through pieces of Silla poetry such as Changipalang-ga (Ï∞¨Í∏∞ÌååÎûëÍ∞Ä), Mojugjilang-ga (Î™®Ï£ΩÏßÄÎûëÍ∞Ä), and Ch'oyong- ga (Ï≤òÏö©Í∞Ä). During the Goryeo dynasty, same-sex sexual activity was also referred to as a union between ‚Äúdragon and sun,‚Äù which bestowed a sense of social worth upon same-sex relationships at the time. During the Joseon Dynasty, however, Korean society experienced a complete shift and Confucian elitists declared homosexuality wicked and depraved, but it still occurred underground, among both commoners and nobles. Evidence of homosexual activities among the common people are harder to find as there are fewer records pertaining to them. Common people were less likely to be literate with writing and less likely to have their records preserved. During the Joseon Era before the Japanese annexation there were travelling theater groups known as namsadang which included underaged males called midong (beautiful boys). The troupes provided \\"various types of entertainment, including band music, song, masked dance, circus, and puppet plays,\\" sometimes with graphic representations of same-sex intercourse. ==Recent history in South Korea== Some of these organizations also work to prevent the spread of AIDS-HIV. Among the active organizations are; * Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea * Chingusai * Korean Sexual-Minority Culture and Rights Center (KSCRC) * Lesbian and Gay Alliance Against Discrimination in Korea (LGAAD Korea) * Lesbian Counseling Center in S. Korea (Kirikiri) One of the first legal victories of these organizations came in 2003, when the Korean National Human Rights Protection Committee formally advised the Korea's Youth Protection Committee to remove homophobic language from the Youth Protection Act of 1997, that had been used to justify the government harassment and censorship of LGBT South Korean film festivals and webpages. In the Anti-discrimination Act introduced in 2007 by The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea, the section prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation has been withdrawn, following outrages from conservative Christian organisations. While there are no federal laws against LGBT discrimination, various municipalities such as Seoul and Jeju have enacted their own ordinances against it. In March 2015, the Ministry of Education enacted a new set of rules prohibiting the teaching of homosexuality or any other non-normative sexual orientations in sex education curricula. === Timeline of recent LGBT activism in South Korea === * 1993.12.

This contrasts with the agency's handling of the festival in 2015, in which they had denied permission to the parade amid concerns of traffic disruptions and violent counter-protests. ===Political representation=== South Korean political parties tend to avoid formally addressing LGBT rights issues, as do most of the elected politicians. A major exception would be the Democratic Labour Party. The Democratic Labour Party (), established in January 2000, is the third-largest political party in South Korea and has a political panel known as the Sexual Minorities Committee () which advocates the recognition and political representation of sexual minorities. Their stated agenda includes a campaign against homophobia and discrimination based on sexual preferences, equal rights for sexual minorities (in their own words \\"complete freedom, equality, and right of pursuit of happiness for homosexuals\\") ÌïúÍµ≠Ï†ïÎãπÏÇ¨ Ï≤´ ÎèôÏÑ±Ïï† Í≥µÏãùÍ∏∞Íµ¨ Îñ¥Îã§ : Ï†ïÏπò : Ïù∏ÌÑ∞ÎÑ∑ÌïúÍ≤®Î†à as well as the legalization of same-sex marriages. On its campaign bid for the 2004 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Labour Party promised the abolition of all inequalities against sexual minorities and won a record 10 seats in the Kukhoe National Assembly. On July 30, 2004, the Committee filed a formal complaint against the Incheon District Court's decision to refuse the recognition of same-sex marriages. The complaint was filed on the grounds that the decision is unconstitutional since neither the Constitution nor civil law define marriage as being between a man and a woman (the only mentioned requisite is age of majority) and that the Constitution explicitly forbids discrimination \\"pertaining to all political, economic, social, or cultural aspects of life of an individual.\\" The Committee also claimed that refusal to recognize same-sex marriages constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation and a refusal to provide equal protection under the law. On December 19, 2007, Lee Myung-bak of the conservative Grand National Party won the presidential election. In a 2007 newspaper interview, the president-elect stated that homosexuality is \\"abnormal\\", and that he opposed legal recognition of same-sex marriages. During South Korea's April 9, 2008 elections, Choi Hyun-sook (ÏµúÌòÑÏàô) became South Korea's first openly gay candidate for national public office when she ran for a seat in the National Assembly of South Korea. Her bid was unsuccessful. ===Educational and online representation=== 16 years old female South Korean student, Kang Min-jin (Í∞ïÎØºÏßÑ), was noticeable for publicizing a series of protests in front of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education for neglecting the sexual rights of South Korean teenagers. LGBT activism in universities In the late 1990s, college students became leading voices of South Korea's Pro-Democracy Movement. In 1995, gay and lesbian student groups began to emerge on college campuses. Among them include Come Together at Yonsei University, Maum 001 at Seoul National University, Hwarang at Kunkook University, and Saram and Saram at Korea University. Students at Korean universities experienced difficulties with being open about their sexualities. Forming these groups on campuses legitimized and increased their visibility. Two prominent members from Ch'ingusai, Dong-jin Suh and Jung-woo Lee, came out as openly gay at their respective universities, which encouraged more students to be open about their sexuality. In October 1995, these two male students teamed up with young feminist student activists to host a \\"Sexual Politics Festival\\" at Yonsei University. This event engaged university students in issues of campus rape, lesbianism and family. Suh and Lee, among other student leaders, were given media attention for their activism. They were invited to television talk shows, radio shows, and university lectures to discuss their efforts at increasing the visibility of lesbians and gay men to the public. LGBT online cultures In 1995, South Korea's gay and lesbian communities grew more quickly than it had in pervious years due to the influx of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) on Korean internet servers. Three Korean servers, Hitel, Chollian, and Nownuri facilitated online communication between Korean gays and lesbians. The BBSs were computer systems with chat features that allowed users to interact with each other. The groups enabled queer South Koreans to share information and overcome isolation. From online communication, the members of the BBSs were able to organize meet-ups and spread educational information regarding the rise of HIV and AIDS, which were not always immediately accessible elsewhere. Eventually, these online chat groups lead to the emergence of popular websites where gay men and lesbians could interact with others from around the world. Some such websites included Exzone for gay men and TG-Net for lesbians. === Film representation === LGBT and/or Queer representation in South Korean film has been noted in films starting as early as the emergence of cinema in South Korea to the present. However, it should be recognized that categorization of LGBT/queer films can be unclear due to variation in how LGBT/Queer characters and storylines are represented, ranging from subtle allusions to more obvious and overt depictions. Ambiguity as to what constitutes queer representation also stems from debate over how to define the term \\"queer.\\" While LGBT/queer representation varies greatly in cinema, non-normative elements and transgressive qualities may promote a queer reading of film, thus placing it in the category of LGBT/queer. Films directed by openly LGBTQ directors have mostly been released independently and as short films. These include Lee Song Hee-il's films Everyday is Like Sunday (1997) and No Regret (2006) as well as Kimjo Kwang-soo's films Boy Meets Boy (2008)Giammarco, Tom. (2013). Queer Cinema. In C. Balmain (Ed.), Directory of World Cinema: South Korea (pp. 170-171) Chicago, IL: Intellect. and Just Friends? (2009).Balmain, Colette. (2013). Queer Cinema. In C. Balmain (Ed.), Directory of World Cinema: South Korea (pp. 175-176) Chicago, IL: Intellect. Films by LGBTQ directors are not limited to short films however, as seen by the feature-length film by Kim Kyung-mook's, Stateless Things (2011). Notable films in Korean queer cinema include Ascetic: Woman and Woman (Kim Su-hyeong, 1976) which won awards during the time of its release but did not receive much popularity. Road Movie (Kim In-shik, 2002), released through a major film company did not have the expected box office results, but has been seen as a precursor to queer films that came after it. One of the most mainstream and successful queer films is The King and the Clown (Lee Joon-ik, 2005) which represented LGBT themes mainly through it subtext rather than explicit depictions, but reached a mainstream audience. The Handmaiden (Park Chan-wook, 2016) also found striking success at the box office and like The King and the Clown, depicted homosexuality in a subtle way that conveyed queer sexual tension. ===Lesbian experience=== Statistics In 2004, the Lesbian Counseling Center in South Korea (formerly Kirikiri) and the Lesbian Institute for Lesbians (LIFL) ran a research study titled ‚ÄúResearch of Actual Condition of Lesbians of South Korea, 2004‚Äù. The study was the first of its kind and was intended to be used as a basis for policy development. 561 lesbians were surveyed. 69.3% of lesbians who were surveyed reported having been troubled by sexuality in their teen years. 95% of the surveyed lesbians reported having been in a relationship, most of which occurred for the first time in their teen years also. Due to homophobia they experienced, lesbians experienced difficulties with coming out. They expressed fear in being punished, fired, and stigmatized. Some lesbians expressed threats of being outed, sexual violence and blackmail. 90.8% of lesbians who were harmed did not seek help from police. These instances and others brought about mental and emotional difficulties for lesbians in South Korea. Lesbians expressed trouble with hiding relationships, internalized homophobia, and relationships with their families. The study found: 1\\\\. 69.3% of lesbians experienced trouble with their sexual identity as a teenager 2\\\\. 74.7% felt pain in their familial relationships 3\\\\. 67.4% experienced emotional pain when family or friends expressed homophobia 4\\\\. 12.9% of those who expressed discrimination faced sexual violence Kirikiri Kirikiri is the first lesbian rights movement group of South Korea. It formed in November 1994 as a separation from a larger lesbian and gay Korean group, Chodonghoe. A defining event in Kirikiri‚Äôs history occurred in 2001 when Suk Ja Kang, a representative from the Korean Association of Women‚Äôs Studies (KAWS) argued in a paper titled ‚ÄúCritical Study of Lesbian Feminism: A Comparison with Korean Women‚Äôs Experience‚Äù that lesbians are an abnormal group in Korean society created as a ‚Äúproduct of Western theory‚Äù and should be excluded from feminist discourse. The exclusion of lesbians from women's movements was a factor that inspired resistance from Kirikiri members. The homophobia presented in this paper at the Fall Annual Conference compelled Kirikiri to demand KAWS withdraw its claims. However, Kang refused and responded by saying that Kirikiri members should present their opposing thoughts at future conferences. In addition to experiencing exclusion from the KAWS, Kirikiri faced homophobic backlash from the Korean Foundation for Women (KFW). The KFW refused to authorize funding for Kirikiri claiming that Kirikiri was a \\"lesbian organization\\" and as such, could not be considered a \\"women's organization\\". Kirikiri was the first lesbian organization to apply for the fund, but the KFW rendered lesbians as sexual minorities but not women. In response, Kirikiri made a public statement. Propelled by the backlash, the Korean Foundation for Women allocated the fund to a sexual minority group three years later in 2005. Kirikiri‚Äôs resistance brought Korean lesbians out of social erasure. Eventually, Kirikiri changed names. The organization is presently known as the Lesbian Counseling Center in South Korea. Project L(esbian) In 2005, Project L was the first exhibition organized by openly bisexual women and lesbian artists in South Korea. The Project L exhibition was initially was supposed to take place at the 2004 Wolgyung Festival. However, a week before the opening, the organizers of the event canceled the exhibition. They claimed that the scope of the exhibition did not fit the theme of that year which was the promotion of ‚Äúpositive images of the natural female body.‚Äù Some lesbians and bisexual women who showcased their art opted to limit publicity in art magazines because they feared opposition from other feminist artists in the art community. Project L increased visibility for queer women in Korea, but the fear of social repercussions was still alive. Project L was showcased at Konkuk University where artists were also fearful of homophobic violence from students who attended the university. In 2008, a second exhibition called Gender Spectrum followed Project L. == See also == * LGBT rights in South Korea * LGBT history ==References External links == * Chingusai * Korean Sexual-Minority Culture and Rights Center (KSCRC) South Korea Category:LGBT in South Korea ","title":"LGBT history in South Korea"},{"id":"35869940","text":"Cranford House School is a non-selective independent day school for girls aged 3 to 16 and boys aged 3 to 11, in Moulsford, a village in South Oxfordshire near Wallingford, England. From September 2020, a Sixth Form will be added and boys will be admitted into Year 7 and Year 12 with a view to the school gradually becoming fully co-educational. Established in 1931 by a Moulsford resident, Miss Winifred E Laurence, the school now numbers around 420 pupils. Cranford House was rated Excellent in every category at its most recent ISI Inspection in November 2014. 2347 QS Cranford House 284 low res ==School history1931 ‚Äì 1939=== Cranford House was founded in 1931 as a school for just one pupil, six-year-old Boris Higgs. The school's founder, Miss Winifred E Laurence taught Billy in her own home, Cranford House, a large Victorian mansion on the site of what is now Moulsford Preparatory School. Billy was joined by other children, some of them much younger, and Miss Laurence's old nursery became a schoolroom where Miss Tollit taught \\"the babies\\". The school taught traditional values within a Church of England religious framework. The school continued to thrive, outgrowing the three rooms in Cranford House and adding on purpose‚Äìbuilt rooms. The curriculum was expanded with lessons taken outdoors as much as possible and new activities added such as riding lessons, piano and percussion, carpentry for the boys, trips out and the first play, \\"A Market Square\\", produced in 1937. ===The War years=== During the Second World War school life continued as usual with minor adaptations. Miss Laurence opened the school during the summer holidays so that all children, including evacuees, could enjoy games, bathing and other activities. Petrol rationing meant children were rowed up the river to school or used the pony and trap, and rambles on the Downs included a new game of \\"Rabbits\\" where children had to stay still until the whistle blew, never guessing that it was practice for the times German bombers flew overhead. ===1945 ‚Äì 1980=== The school was continually growing and, by 1950, when pupil numbers had reached 136 it was recognised that more space was required. The whole of Cranford House was adapted for use and a swimming pool was built. In 1953 Moulsford House was acquired and some of the school moved across the road, becoming a dual site. Cranford House was granted official recognition following an inspection by the Department of Education and Science in 1955. The same year the first link was made with Pangbourne College. By 1961 the volume of traffic through Moulsford made crossing the road dangerous. As a result, Miss Laurence sold her home and the whole school was re-located to its current site. A sister school to Cranford House was opened near Worthing in West Sussex the same year. Called Rustington House, it had the same uniform, syllabus and ethos as Cranford. Miss Tollit took over the day-to-day running of the school and Miss Shine also spent much time there. At Cranford House a gymnasium was built in 1967 and many new activities were introduced such as canoeing, rock-climbing and national show-jumping competitions at Hickstead. In 1969 the great willow tree in the courtyard died and Miss Laurence decided it was her cue to retire. She retained her interest in the school however and in 1975 presented the generous gift of a swimming pool on the site of the old walled vegetable garden. A new willow tree was planted, which still flourishes today, and Miss Shine became headmistress until her retirement in 1980. Miss Shine left a thriving school of over 300 pupils and her departure marked the establishment of a charitable trust under a Board of Governors. ===1980 ‚Äì The Present Day=== From 1992 the headmistress, Alison Gray, adopted a more modern curriculum, adding new extra- curricular activities. As a result, Cranford's reputation for strong musical, dramatic and sporting traditions began to grow, becoming widely recognised over the years. A new science block opened in 1985, The Barn was rebuilt in 1988, and additional tennis and netball courts were added in 1990. In recent times the school has developed its facilities to cope with the increase in pupil numbers and changes in the curriculum. A cover was added to the swimming pool, the third science block built, along with the Orangery dining room, the Atrium/Library, an all-weather astroturf pitch and a modern, well-equipped sports hall in 2014. In 2016 Cranford House celebrated its 85th anniversary with a choral service at Dorchester Abbey and a very well-attended alumni reunion in school. Future enhancements to the school have been announced as part of Cranford House's '2020 Vision ' and include an enhanced Junior School with its own discrete reception and library, a new STEM Centre, the addition of an on-site Sixth Form and refurbished and improved Creative and Performing Arts facilities. The school has also announced the move to a fully coeducational model, starting in September 2020 with boys entering the Senior School in Year 7 and the Sixth Form in Year 12. == External links== *School Website *Profile on the ISC website *ISI Inspection Reports Category:Educational institutions established in 1931 Category:Girls' schools in Oxfordshire Category:Independent schools in Oxfordshire Category:Member schools of the Girls' Schools Association ","title":"Cranford House School"},{"id":"35869954","text":"The Military-Political System of Samos () was a provisional regime that existed in the island of Samos during the Greek War of Independence. Samos rose up against Ottoman rule on 18 April 1821, under the leadership of Konstantinos Lachanas. In May 1821, the Samiot leader Lykourgos Logothetis formalized the provisional administrative regime of the island, with the promulgation of the \\"Military-Political Organization of the Island of Samos\\" (Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒîŒπŒøœÅŒ≥Œ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒùŒÆœÉŒøœÖ Œ£Œ¨ŒºŒøœÖ). This constitutional document organized both the executive-legislative and military administration of the island. At the apex of the system was a Governor-General (ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒîŒπŒøŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÑŒÆœÇ), assisted by three Political Judges (Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ ŒöœÅŒπœÑŒ≠œÇ) who were elected by a General Assembly of the island, composed of the elected ephors of each village, and the Secretary of the Administration (ŒìœÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒµœçœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒîŒπŒøŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÑŒ∑œÅŒØŒøœÖ). There were also a Police President, Harbour Masters and Customs officials. The island's military was organized into four chiliarchies, with the Governor-General as the commander-in-chief. Logothetis appointed four of his closest aides as the first chiliarchs, who appointed subordinate pentakosiarchs, and they in turn appointed subordinate hekatontarchs, etc. Nevertheless, the Greek provisional government that emerged from the First National Assembly at Epidaurus attempted to abolish the separate Samian institutions with its law on provincial administration 30 April 1822, and impose an appointed governor, Kyriakos Moralis. This led to a short civil war on the island, with the supporters of the local system winning out. With the exception of a short period in 1828‚Äì1830, during the governorship of Ioannis Kapodistrias, when Samos was administered as part of the Province of the Eastern Sporades, the island retained its autonomous political system. Due to its proximity to the Anatolian shore and its distance from the main centres of the Greek Revolution on the Greek mainland, Samos was particularly vulnerable to Ottoman attack. With the crucial assistance of the Greek revolutionary fleet, the Samians were successful in repelling three Ottoman attempts at recapturing the island, in July 1821, August‚ÄìSeptember 1824 and July‚ÄìAugust 1826. The island, however, was not incorporated into the independent Kingdom of Greece. Instead, the island resumed its separate government until it was transformed into an autonomous tributary principality in 1834. ==References  External links == * * Category:Political institutions of the Greek War of Independence Category:States and territories established in 1821 Category:Political history of Greece Category:1821 establishments in Greece Category:History of Samos Category:1834 disestablishments in Europe ","title":"Military-Political System of Samos"},{"id":"35869966","text":" ","title":"Hypobole"},{"id":"35869987","text":"This is a list of electoral results for the electoral district of Robina in Queensland state elections. ==Members for Robina== {  - !colspan=\\"2\\"Member!!Party!!Term -    Bob Quinn  Liberal  2001‚Äì2006 -   rowspan=\\"2\\" Ray Stevens  Liberal  2006‚Äì2008 -    Liberal National  2008‚Äì2009 - } ==Election resultsElections in the 2000s=References== Category:Queensland state electoral results by district ","title":"Electoral results for the district of Robina"},{"id":"35869997","text":"Holme is the site of a lost settlement in West Lindsey, Lincolnshire, England.

It is sometimes regarded as an early fish, and therefore as one of the first vertebrates. Zhongjianichthys is named after Zhongjian in China. == Physical characteristics == The eyes are located behind the antero-dorsal lobe and the mouth apparently did not have a jaw. It lacked scales, and had a thick skin. We know it had a thicker skin than other chordates at that time because, unlike Myllokunmingia, no impressions of its myomeres have been found. The ventral fin is low in height, and runs much of the body's length. Although Zhonjianichthys appears more advanced than its relatives due to the back- positioned eyes and the thicker skin, this may be convergent evolution and it may not, therefore, be particularly closely related to the ancestors of modern chordates. == Ecology == Zhongjianichthys' reduced fins may indicate that it was mainly bottom-dwelling and did not swim much. This could have been a factor in its evolution of thicker skin, as protection from predators. == Locations == Zhongjianichthys specimens have been found in the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China. ==References== Category:Maotianshan shales fossils Category:Prehistoric jawless fish genera Category:Cambrian fish Category:Fossil taxa described in 2003 Category:Cambrian chordates ","title":"Zhongjianichthys"},{"id":"35870026","text":"Vandana Hemant Chavan (born 6 July 1961), is an Indian politician and advocate.

In September 2017 he surrendered to police but was released on bail. On 13 December 2017 he, together with his driver, was gunned down in his own car near Sukhumi. ==Career== Pavel Ardzinba has generally shunned publicity. In the summer of 2005, he gave one interview with the opposition newspaper Forum. According to the article, Ardzinba was born in 1951 in Gudauta and graduated from Duripsh high school. He studied at but did not graduate from the Law Faculty of Rostov State University (at the same time as Alexander Ankvab). During the 1992-1993 war with Georgia, Ardzinba became Deputy Minister of Defence responsible for Armaments and Technology. Ardzinba claimed that before the war, he was the richest man of Abkhazia with assets of 600 million rubles and that he contributed greatly to the war effort. After the war, Pavel Ardzinba became President of the Abkhazian-Turkish company Abtur. According to an August 2005 estimate by the newspaper Ekho Abxazii, Ardzinba was still the wealthiest and the fifth most influential businessman of Abkhazia. ==Involvement in criminal affairsAssassination of Aka Ardzinba=== Under the Presidency of Vladislav Ardzinba, Pavel Ardzinba was generally believed to head one of the country's two main clans, and to be responsible for the murder of Aka Ardzinba in Moscow on 3 February 2003, the head of the other clan. ===Assassination attempts on Alexander Ankvab=== The current President of Abkhazia, Alexander Ankvab, has been targeted by several assassination attempts since first becoming Prime Minister in 2005. On 15 May 2012, the prosecutor office made public that on 14 May, it had placed Pavel Ardzinba on an international wanted list because it suspected him of organising the attempts in February 2012 (together with former Interior Minister Almasbei Kchach) and July 2007. On 15 May, the court ordered Ardzinba's preliminary detention in absentia. ===Assassination attempts on Beslan Ardzinba=== On 20 September 2007, an anti-tank grenade was fired from an RPG-26 launcher at the Mercedes-Benz E-220 of Pitsunda Mayor Beslan Ardzinba while it was driving down the coastal road near the village of Blabyrkhua, Gudauta District. On 1 June 2009 around 9:00, an improvised explosive devise planted at the entrance of the town hall was remotely detonated as Beslan Ardzinba and two colleagues entered the building, causing varying degrees of injuries. On 16 May 2012, in the course of the investigation into the assassination attempts on Alexander Ankvab, the Prosecutor General also indicted Pavel Ardzinba for having organised the two attempts on the life of Beslan Ardzinba. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Gudauta Category:Deaths by firearm in Georgia (country) ","title":"Pavel Ardzinba"},{"id":"35870043","text":"Prior to his death in 2018, Swedish DJ and record producer Avicii (also known under the aliases Tim Berg and Tom Hangs) released two studio albums, one compilation album, one remix album, one mix album, 51 singles, one promotional single and 29 music videos.

The Grand National was run there in 1916, 1917 and 1918, but its principal race was the Gatwick Cup. From around 1930, the course was managed by George Gurton, who moved there from the Colchester area of Essex with his wife Ruby and two sons, Eustace Guy and Oswald George. A small airport was built at the southeastern edge of the property, with a circular terminal building called \\"The Beehive\\". There is a pub at nearby Tinsley Green called The Beehive. ==After closure== The racecourse bandstand, now in Queens Square. As of June 2018, the Band Stand is now in the memorial gardens Crawley After the Second World War, the stables and racecourse were used for training by, among others, Jack Holt. The surrounding land was farmed by George Gurton and subsequently by his elder son, (Eustace) Guy Gurton. The Gurton family lived in the farmhouse until 1959 and farmed the area, using the land for mixed arable. Private trainers rented the stables and used the defunct course for training. In 1957, the racecourse was chosen as the site of the second major London airport, and the stables and house were demolished around 1960. A lodge house still remains on Povey Cross Road. The Gurton family emigrated to Australia in 1959. Many of Gurton's descendants still live in the surrounding Horley, Crawley and Charlwood areas. Some members of the family are buried at Charlwood Parish Church cemetery. The airport obliterated the racecourse and left no evidence that it was there, but there is a Racecourse Restaurant in Gatwick Airport and also a WH Smith store which the business internally refer to as Winning Post due to its location in relation to the old race course. as well as both Racecourse Road and Furlong Way roads within the airport boundaries. The racecourse's bandstand was relocated to Queens Square in Crawley. ==References *Gatwick Racecourse on race day *The Grand National at Gatwick **Map: Gatwick Racecourse superimposed on map of the modern Gatwick Airport Category:Defunct horse racing venues in England Category:Sports venues completed in 1891 Category:1891 establishments in England Category:Gatwick Airport ","title":"Gatwick Racecourse"},{"id":"35870196","text":"Portrait of Jan van Walr√© with his horse, dog and stableboy, by Wybrand Hendricks, 1787 Jan van Walr√© (1759, Haarlem - 1837, Haarlem), was a 19th- century bookseller, poet and playwright from the Northern Netherlands. ==Biography== He was a Remonstrant married to a Mennonite and a bookseller who became a member of Teylers Eerste Genootschap from 1781‚Äì1782. He received a large inheritance in 1782, leading him to cease his business activities and pursue his hobbies.De verborgen wereld van Democriet: Een kolderiek en dichtlievend genootschap te Haarlem 1789-1869, by Bert Sliggers, 1995, Schuyt & Co., In the same year, he joined a literature society started by Adriaan Loosjes, Vlijt moeder der Wetenschappen and became an actor. In 1785 the society was reinvented as the theater society Leerzaam vermaak with a strong Patriotic bias with Loosjes and Walr√© the leaders. In 1787 Walr√© joined the Haarlem vrijkorps (armed citizen's guard) named Pro aris et focis as a captain and served in 1787 in Nieuwersluis. When this action failed and Haarlem returned to the orangists, Leerzaam vermaak was forbidden, but the group became active again in 1788. Loosjes began to avoid politics and in 1789 he started the Haarlem scientific society Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen. To continue his comedy pursuits, he began the society Democriet in the same year with the remark Because Heraclitus had to cry, Democritus had to laugh. In 1790, Walr√© joined, who again added political color, despite Loosjes' intentions to remain neutral. In 1795 when the French occupation began, the activities of Democriet reached their peak, and after that moment the society began to show similarities with freemasonry. According to the RKD he was the grandmaster of the Haarlem satirical literary society Democriet and an amateur draughtsman.Jan van Walr√© in the RKDPortrait as a grandmaster of Democriet in the RKD by Dirk Jurriaan Sluyter in 1807 File:Wybrand Hendriks - Jan van Walr√© as Henry IV - FHM01 OS-I-150 W.JPGJan van Walr√© as Henry IV File:Wybrand Hendriks - Maria Kops with daughter.jpgHis wife Maria Kops with their daughter Catharina Hillegonda, who later married Johannes Ensched√© III. ==References== *Author page in the DBNL * Books by Jan van Walr√© on the Google Books Library Project *Jan van Walr√© on Jacob Campo Weyerman website Category:1759 births Category:1837 deaths Category:Dutch male poets Category:Members of Teylers Eerste Genootschap Category:People from Haarlem Category:Remonstrants Category:Dutch male dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century Dutch dramatists and playwrights Category:19th-century Dutch dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Jan van Walr√©"},{"id":"35870201","text":"Incheon Nonhyeon Station is a railroad station in Namdong-gu, Incheon.

As the sequel to the 2011 bestseller Divergent, it continues the story of Tris Prior and the dystopian post-apocalyptic version of Chicago. Following the events of the previous novel, a war now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. While trying to save the people that she loves, Tris faces questions of grief, forgiveness, identity, loyalty, politics, and love. The book was first published on May 1, 2012, by the HarperCollins imprints Katherine Tegen Books in the U.S. and HarperCollins Children's Books in the UK, and a \\"Collector's Edition\\" was published on October 30 in the United States. Insurgent received mostly positive reviews from critics, with reviewers praising Roth's writing. A film adaptation of the novel was released on March 20, 2015. ==Background== The background to the story, revealed in the first novel of the trilogy, explains how Chicago in the post-apocalyptic future is now a society that defines its citizens by strict conformity to their social and personality affiliations with five different factions. Thar removes the threat of anyone exercising independent will and threatening the population's safety again by war or some other human-created catastrophe. The factions are Abnegation for the selfless, Amity for the peaceful, Candor for the honest, Dauntless for the brave, and Erudite for the intelligent. Those who are tested with equal aptitude for more than one faction are deemed \\"Divergent.\\". Their capability for independent thought beyond the restrictive nature of the factions causes Divergents to be considered threats to the society and to be hunted and killed by the ruthless leader of Erudite to eliminate the \\"threat\\" of independent thinking. Factions are meant to be a lifetime allegiance, far more important than family, and \\"faction before blood\\" is a societal motto. Those who fail the initiation of their particular faction or subsequently leave it are \\"Factionless,\\" a permanently-homeless group of outcasts that is deemed to be a drain on society. ==Plot== After the events of Divergent, Beatrice \\"Tris\\" Prior, Tobias \\"Four\\" Eaton, Caleb Prior, Peter Hayes, and Marcus Eaton seek refuge in the Amity sector. Tris overhears Marcus and Amity leader Johanna Reyes discuss the fact that the Abnegation leaders died to protect secret information. Erudite and the Dauntless traitors arrive to arrest the Divergents, but Tris flees with Four, Caleb, and Susan Black on a train to the Factionless sector. There, they meet Tobias' mother, Evelyn Johnson-Eaton, who tries to persuade her son to sway Dauntless into joining forces with the Factionless against Erudite. While Caleb and Susan return to Abnegation, Tris and Tobias head to Candor headquarters, where the other Dauntless now reside. Under truth serums, Tobias confides his reasons for transferring to Dauntless, and Tris reveals her killing of Will in self- defense, which strains her relationship with her friend Christina. That night, the Dauntless traitors, led by Eric, arrive and shoot simulation serums into their fellow Dauntless and knock everyone unconscious except the Divergents: Tris, Uriah Pedrad, and several others. As Eric begins executing the Divergents, Tris wounds him and allows the others to capture him as the remaining traitors flee. Their safety is revealed to be guaranteed by Erudite renegade and Will's sister, Cara. Tris, Tobias, Lynn, and Shauna spy on the discussion arranged by the Candor leader Jack Kang with Jeanine Matthews's representative and Dauntless traitor, Max. Lynn shoots and kills Max, and Shauna is rendered paraplegic by a nerve serum. To prevent Jeanine from holding another prisoner exchange, the Dauntless vote to execute Eric, which Tobias does so without hesitation. To avoid being dependent on Candor, the Dauntless return to their own headquarters and disable most of the security cameras inside. However, Tris is alerted by Christina that one camera has caused three Dauntless members (Marlene, Hector, and Kee) to become simulated into attempting suicide unless a Divergent is handed over. They are unable to save Marlene. Tris surrenders to Erudite and is placed in a cell by Peter and, to her shock, Caleb, both of whom are working with Jeanine. Tobias follows and is captured but not before he convinces Dauntless to ally with the Factionless, with their insurgency arranged to occur several days. After unsuccessful simulation tests, Jeanine orders Tris' execution, but Peter swaps the lethal dose with a paralytic and frees Tobias, and the three escape to Abnegation. Tris meets with Marcus, who tells her that Jeanine has withheld Abnegation's secret. If the Factionless learned of it, it would certainly be destroyed. Tris, Christina, and Marcus head for Amity to request Johanna's help. She, alongside several others including Susan's brother, Robert, choose to assist them, despite Amity's resistance. They are joined by Cara and another Erudite renegade, Fernando, who act as navigators. The \\"Insurgents\\" infiltrate Erudite headquarters. Fernando is killed, but they manage to access Jeanine's laboratory. Inside, Tris faces down simulations before she confronts Jeanine, who is cornered by Tori Wu. Tori kills Jeanine and then brands Tris a traitor. The invasion of Erudite over, Tris learns of the casualties, including Lynn, and the fact that the Factionless have taken all weapons to rule in Jeanine's place. Tris is handcuffed, alongside Christina, Marcus, and the other Insurgents, but manages to pass the information to Tobias, which he and Caleb share through the computers. The secret video, narrated by Edith Prior, from \\"an organization fighting for peace,\\" reveals that the world had become corrupt, and the city was sealed to allow the Divergents to increase, and Amity was then to open the fence forever and allow the population to re- enter the world. The room erupts into voices as the book ends. ==Setting== The setting is a dystopian Chicago in the far future in which Lake Michigan has turned into a giant marsh. The Candor compound surrounds a ruined Merchandise Mart, called the \\"Merciless Mart\\" because of their unrelenting honesty. The Amity live on farms outside a fence that surrounds the city and keeps the other factions in; their central meeting area is a building with a great tree in the center. The Dauntless compound is the combination of a glass building and a deep cave underneath it and is nicknamed \\"The Pit.\\" The Abnegation sector is a cookie-cutter neighborhood in which \\"everything looks alike.\\" The Erudite compound is in a futuristic part of the city, including the former site of Grant Park (a sculpture resembling the famous \\"Cloud Gate\\" is mentioned in Divergent), and the buildings are very advanced. ==Themes== Some of the major themes in the book are rebellion, romance, bravery, courage, friendship, betrayal, the search for individual identity, and heroism. ==Paperback editions== In the US, the book was released in the paperback format on January 20, 2015. The standard retail version includes previously- unreleased material (deleted scenes). There are also several retailer exclusive versions at Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, Target, and Walmart, each with different deleted scenes and questions and answers with the authors. ==Critical reception== Insurgent received mostly-positive reviews from critics. The trade publication Publisher Weekly received the novel enthusiastically: \\"Roth knows how to write. So even though this second book of the trilogy that began with Divergent feels like a necessary bridge between the haunting story she created in book one and the hinted-at chaos of book three, readers will be quick to forgive.... The author has a subtle way of pulling readers into a scene ('The outside air.... smells green, the way a leaf does when you tear it in half'), and the novel's love story, intricate plot, and unforgettable setting work in concert to deliver a novel that will rivet fans of the first book.\\" Kirkus Reviews said, \\"The unrelenting suspense piles pursuit upon betrayal upon torture upon pitched battles; the violence is graphic, grisly and shockingly indiscriminate. The climactic reveal, hinting at the secret origins of their society, is neither surprising nor particularly plausible, but the frenzied response makes for another spectacular cliffhanger.\\" Roth has admitted a number of continuity errors in Insurgent, an aftereffect of overlapping novel drafts. ===Awards and nominations=== Insurgent won Favorite Young Adult Fantasy & Science Fiction and Author of 2012 in the Goodreads Choice Awards. It was also nominated at Children's Choice Book Awards for Teen book of the year and Author of the year. ==Film adaptation== Summit Entertainment announced that a film adaptation of Insurgent would be released as The Divergent Series: Insurgent on March 20, 2015, as a sequel to the film adaptation of Divergent, with Brian Duffield originally chosen to write the script for the film. On December 16, 2013, it was announced that Neil Burger, the director of Divergent, would not return to direct Insurgent because he was still working on the first film. On February 13, 2014, it was announced that Robert Schwentke was offered the director position for the film and that Akiva Goldsman had been hired to rewrite Duffield's script. The Divergent Series: Insurgent began filming in Atlanta on May 27, 2014, and concluded on September 6, 2014. ==References *Publishers Weekly on Insurgent Category:2012 science fiction novels Category:2012 novels Category:Action novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:American science fiction novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Divergent trilogy Category:Dystopian novels Category:HarperCollins books Category:Novels set in Chicago ","title":"Insurgent (novel)"},{"id":"35870227","text":"Euroleague Basketball is the private company that runs and operates the top two continental-wide basketball men's professional sports club competitions in Europe, the first-tier level EuroLeague, and the second-tier level EuroCup.

One person was killed and twenty six others, including the Pakistani ambassador, were injured. The attack occurred due to the Afghan peoples belief that Pakistan had helped the Taliban to take the city. ==Background== The attack against the Pakistani embassy by pro-government protestors in Kabul took place a day after the Taliban militia had successfully established control over Herat. When the Taliban took control of Herat, they arrested hundreds of its citizens, closed down all the schools and \\"forcibly implement[ed] their social bans and Sharia law, even more fiercely than in Kandahar\\". The Taliban imposed as rulers over the city and region extremist Taliban officials \\"many of whom\\" did not even speak the local regional language Persian. Kamal Matinuddin, Lt. General of the Pakistan army and former member of Pakistan's diplomatic corps, alleges the Afghan government sacked the embassy in \\"retaliation for the capture of Herat\\" because they \\"felt\\" the Taliban could have only done so with Pakistan's help. But according to William Maley, the Director of the Asia-Pacific College of Diplomacy, the attack by angry protestors against the Pakistan embassy was due to \\"bitter resentment towards Pakistan which had built up among the victims of Pakistan's strategy\\" first using Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in a destructive bombardment campaign against Kabul and then the Taliban to install a client in Afghanistan. De facto, scholars such as Pakistani analyst Ahmed Rashid, write: \\"[T]he Taliban had spent the summer [of 1995] rebuilding their forces with arms, ammunition and vehicles provided by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and a new command structure created with the help of ISI advisers. The ISI also helped broker an agreement, never made public, between the Taliban and General Rashid Dostum ... to repair Mig fighters and helicopters the Taliban had captured a year earlier in Kandahar, thereby creating the Taliban's first airpower. ... the Taliban quickly mobilised some 25,000 men, many of them fresh volunteers from Pakistan.\\" According to \\"Pakistan and the Taliban\\" by Ahmed Rashid, also published in April 1998 as a column in The Nation, Pakistan furthermore directly provided limited \\"military support\\" in the Taliban's September 1995 offensive against Herat which led to the capture of the city and the subsequent anti-Pakistan protests in Kabul. Rizwan Hussein in \\"Pakistan and the emergence of Islamic militancy in Afghanistan\\" summarises: \\"As has now been established by several scholarly and journalistic works, the Pakistan military establishment directly assisted the Taliban's rise and subsequent capture of this region [Herat] in Afghanistan between 1995 and 1996.\\" The Pakistan Institute of International Affairs describes Pakistan's support to the Taliban as \\"at its height\\" in 1995. The Pakistani ambassador to Kabul, Qazi Humayun, himself alongside Pakistan's Consul General in Herat, Colonel Imam, later attended Taliban meetings in Kandahar. These meetings discussed how the Taliban could best conquer Afghanistan militarily and how \\"best to impose Sharia law\\" over Afghanistan. Pakistani politicians during that time repeatedly denied supporting the Taliban, which has been described by reliable sources as an explicit 'policy of denial'. ==See also== * Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan relations ==References== Category:Attacks on diplomatic missions in Afghanistan Category:Attacks on diplomatic missions of Pakistan Category:Terrorist incidents in Kabul Category:Terrorist incidents in Afghanistan in 1995 Category:20th century in Kabul Category:Afghan Civil War (1992‚Äì1996) Category:Islamic State of Afghanistan Category:1995 in international relations Category:1995 murders in Asia Category:1990s murders in Afghanistan Category:1995 crimes in Afghanistan Category:September 1995 events in Asia Category:1995 in Pakistan Category:Government of Benazir Bhutto Category:Anti-Pakistan sentiment Category:Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan relations ","title":"1995 attack on the Pakistani embassy in Kabul"},{"id":"35870259","text":"Anthony William (Tony) Thomas (born 15 November 1949) is an Australian physicist, Professor of Physics at the University of Adelaide since 1984 and Elder Professor of Physics since 1990.

He is an Olympic champion, having won gold in 2012. He is the first Caribbean male athlete, as well as the first of African descent, to win the gold medal in a throwing event in the history of the Olympics.Athlete Profile - Keshorn Walcott; prepared 24 April 2013, by Kwame Laurence for the IAAF \\"Focus on athletes\\" project; accessed 29 March 2014. He is also the holder of the North, Central American and Caribbean junior record. Walcott is the youngest Olympic gold medallist in the men's javelin (19 years 131 days), and the first athlete in any track and field event to win World Junior and Olympic titles in an individual event the same year. ==CareerEarly life and medals=== Born the third child of Beverly Walcott and Endy King, Walcott grew up playing football and cricket, striving to keep up with his athletically talented older brother Elton. He was raised in the fishing village of Toco, in north-east Trinidad. He did not take up the javelin until the age of 15, but found immediate success. By April 2009, one week after his 16th birthday, he was the Caribbean youth (under-17) champion. In 2010 he stepped up to the standard regulation javelin (800-gram), and he continued his domination of the Caribbean junior division, as the three-time winner in the Junior (under-20) javelin throw at the CARIFTA Games in 2010 to 2012, setting a new NACAC North, Central American and Caribbean junior record in 2012.Lendore, Thomas in World top four ===2012 World Junior Champion=== He began the Olympic year in April with his fourth-consecutive victory at CARIFTA Juniors. A record throw of earned him the distinction of competing unbeaten throughout his CARIFTA career. In late May 2012 he twice improved his personal best, breaking through the 80-meter mark (262 feet) for the first time. At the Quantum Classic in Trinidad and Tobago he threw , breaking Trinidad's national javelin record of , set in 1996 by Kurt Thompson. It was also a NACAC junior record as well.

He extended the records with a winning throw of .Athletes biography-Keshorn Walcott; official competitor's biography compiled by Linley Bernard for Trinidad's NAAATT in 2012, updated in 2013; accessed 29 March 2014. ===2012 London Olympic Champion=== In the stadium on Saturday evening 11 August, made conditions for the javelin throw less than ideal, and worse than during Wednesday's qualifying rounds. Walcott responded to the pressure of the Olympic finals by throwing a personal best distance on his first throw, giving him the lead, and then exceeding that distance on his second throw. He won the Olympic javelin gold medal with a throw of 84.58m (277 ft 6 in). He defeated a string of top athletes to win the competition including 90-metre thrower Tero Pitk√§m√§ki and two-time defending Olympic champion Andreas Thorkildsen,IAAF news report, Men's Javelin Throw Finals, 11 August 2012. as well as Vesel√Ω, Oleksandr Pyatnytsya and Antti Ruuskanen. This made Walcott the youngest-ever Olympic champion in javelin throw and the second non-European to win the Olympic gold in men's javelin throw since American thrower Cy Young in Helsinki in 1952. Steve Backley, a former three-time Olympic medalist in the javelin remarked that it was a \\"surprise win for Keshorn Walcott. Everyone else struggled with the wind\\". Following his Olympic victory, Walcott was hailed as a national hero. On 13 August, the day of his arrival back in Trinidad, was declared a national holiday. He was awarded $150,000 in cash and given land near his hometown of Toco, as well as a luxury home in Port of Spain. In addition, both the Toco lighthouse, (in north-east Trinidad) and the Toco Secondary School were renamed in his honour. Walcott has been coached since 2009 by Cuban-born Ismael Lopez Mastrapa. ===2013 to 2014=== Walcott's 2013 season was hampered by injury. In his first competition since his Olympic victory, he \\"opened big\\", nearly matching his personal best with an opening round throw of at a hometown meet in Hasley Crawford Stadium in Port of Spain, Trinidad, on Friday 3 May. In an early March 2014 interview with BBC Scotland, Walcott said that after some rest his ankle \\"is back to normal\\". With no World or Olympic competitions to aim for, his 2014 season will be targeted on the 2014 Commonwealth Games, to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. He had a six-week training camp in Cuba in March and planned to compete at a few events in May 2014, before taking part in another training camp in Europe so he can adjust to Glasgow's climate. He said, \\"My coach likes me to get away from a lot of distractions and just focus on training and being healthy.\\" In the qualifying round of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Kershorn threw a new personal best of on 1 August, but in the finals on 2 August he finished second with a throw of 82.67m, trailing Julius Yego of Kenya's winning 83.87m.

The film was released on September 25 (Germany) and October 10 (United Kingdom, Italy, Eritrea). ==Plot== Awet (Letekidan Micael) is born the daughter of an Eritrean man and an Ethiopian woman - a bad combination in 1974, in the middle of a long liberation war between the two peoples. Asmara is under Ethiopian occupation, and Awet's father takes to the woods with the Eritrean freedom fighters. Left alone and needy, Awet's mother attempts to kill her, locking it away in a suitcase. Awet survives and is taken to a Catholic orphanage ran by Italian and Eritrean nuns. It is during her time in the orphanage that Awet begins to first perceive the injustice all around her, and gradually learns to stand up for her beliefs. Six years later, her father - whom she believed lost - takes her away to live with his new family. But Awet is not welcome; her father torments her and finally gives her and her elder stepsister to the ‚ÄúMorning Stars‚Äù - a children's unit within one of Eritrea's liberation armies, the Eritrean Liberation Front, also known as Jebha. It's here that Awet finds a new family and a mother substitute in the commander Ma'aza: a beautiful and charismatic young woman who has made her way to one of the leading positions, typically occupied by men. Awet falls for her, and tries anything to catch her attention and win her favour. She endures paramilitary training and the harshness of guerrilla life in the dry Eritrean desert, waiting for the moment she‚Äôll fight at the commander‚Äôs side. But then Awet encounters the first dead bodies: enemies and comrades lying side by side. In her eyes, the dead friends and foes all look shockingly alike - children like her. So when Ma'aza gives her the long-desired Kalashnikov, Awet shirks the drill and pretends to shoot, but with an empty magazine; she even buries her gun. She gets punished, mocked as a coward and isolated. But her refusal to kill and her na√Øve questioning set a troublesome precedent - a challenge to Ma'aza‚Äôs authority. Meanwhile losses to the enemy - the Eritrean People's Liberation Front or Shabia - increase and the enemy tightens the circle. A few of Awet‚Äôs comrades are caught while fleeing and are killed at Ma'aza‚Äôs command. In a final clash with the enemy, the commander calls her fighters to the last sacrifice. But Awet takes control of her destiny this time. She confronts Ma'aza and finally leaves her former idol to her fate. While the troops are breaking apart, Awet is able to save herself and her stepsister - hiding in an abandoned suitcase. ==Cast== * Letekidan Micael as Awet * Solomie Micael as Freweyni * Seble Tilahun as Ma'aza * Daniel Seyoum as Mike'ele * Mekdes Wegene as Amrit * Saniel Samara as Haile * Kybra Negash as Anna ==Reception== Heart of Fire received generally positive reviews; on Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 83% 'fresh' rating, with the consensus \\"beautifully shot and emotionally engaging\\". It was nominated for the International Film Critics Award at the 2010 Los Angeles International Film Festival.

This church, which was built of wood, burnt in 1587 and a new wood church was built. Perhaps the sacristy wasn't damaged in the fire. In the 19th century there were so many people that the church was not enough. In 1877 they started building a new stone church exactly south of the wood church.

In 1555, he enlarged it with the addition of the famous Renaissance bridge carrying a covered gallery. These works were carried out by the architect Jean Bullant (who constructed the gallery at the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceaux) and, possibly, the sculptor Jean Goujon, which would explain the quality of the sculptures, the stone and the colours.

The adapted screenplay was written by Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson. It is based on the 2006 novel Cross by James Patterson and the third installment of the Alex Cross film series, which was considered as a reboot of the series. The title character was previously portrayed by Morgan Freeman in Kiss the Girls (1997) and Along Came a Spider (2001). Unlike the previous films, which were distributed by Paramount Pictures, the film was released by Lionsgate Films on October 19, 2012. ==Plot== Dr. Alex Cross (Tyler Perry) is a psychologist and police lieutenant who now lives in Detroit with his wife Maria (Carmen Ejogo) and their children. After learning Maria is pregnant, Cross considers accepting a job as an FBI profiler. Meanwhile, a man (Matthew Fox) participates in an underground fighting match and seduces businesswoman Fan Yau (Stephanie Jacobsen). The man is invited to Yau's house, where he kills her after injecting her with TTX. At the crime scene, Cross finds a charcoal sketch left behind by the killer in the style of the artist Picasso, leading to the murderer being nicknamed after him. While examining the sketch, Cross deduces that Picasso's next target is German businessman Erich Nunemarcher (Werner Daehn). Picasso attempts to kill Nunemarcher but is foiled by Cross, and escapes after being shot by Cross's partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns). Cross deduces that Picasso also plans to target billionaire CEO Giles Mercier (Jean Reno). As revenge for foiling his attack on Nunemarcher, Picasso attacks Cross and Kane's colleague, Monica Ashe (Rachel Nichols), torturing her to death. Picasso then tracks down Cross, who is on a date with Maria, and kills her with a sniper rifle. Picasso targets Nunemarcher and Mercier at a conference, killing Nunemarcher and seemingly Mercier. Cross and Kane track Picasso to the abandoned Michigan Theater. As Cross and Picasso fight, they fall through the crumbling theater ceiling. Picasso falls to his death, but Kane helps pull Cross to safety. Cross deduces Picasso's employer was Mercier himself. Having embezzled money from his clients, Mercier asked for Yau and Nunemarcher's help to fake his death and flee to Bali, then hired Picasso to eliminate them and a double pretending to be the real Mercier. After Cross frames Mercier for drug smuggling, Mercier is arrested in Indonesia, where he will be condemned to death by firing squad. Having avenged Maria's murder, Cross decides to accept the job offer from the FBI and moves to Washington with his family. ==Cast== * Tyler Perry as Dr. Alex Cross * Edward Burns as Detective Tommy Kane * Matthew Fox as Picasso * Jean Reno as Giles Mercier * Carmen Ejogo as Maria Cross * Cicely Tyson as Regina \\"Nana Mama\\" Cross * Rachel Nichols as Detective Monica Ashe * John C.

Stagg graduated from Turlock High School in 1915 and the University of Southern California. He married Mary Litt Boyd in 1917.Salonga, Jovito, Journey of Struggle and Hope, 2001.

In 1933, Stagg and other church members left the Central Church and the GCMCA, and formed the Cosmopolitan Student Church (now the Cosmopolitan Church) and the General Conference of the Methodist Church of the Philippines.Unfortunately, the Cosmopolitan Church has no library usable for research.

Quezon's veto of a Catholic-supported Commonwealth Assembly bill to provide religious instruction in public schools.The Philippines Free Press: Meanwhile, \\"fighting\\" Rev. Samuel W.

Their remains have been exhumed and re-interred at Cosmopolitan Church. ===Samuel Boyd Stagg=== Samuel and Mary Stagg's son Samuel Boyd Stagg (d. 2008) was arrested with his mother 28 January 1944,\\"During the house arrest period, Mary Boyd Stagg, pastor of the Cosmopolitan Church and others in the congregation, were helping the Filipino guerrillas. Somebody infiltrated their number and the Japanese came suddenly to pick her up. It happened that young Sam Boyd Stagg, Mary's son, was out with his bicycle at the time the Japanese came to pick up his family. He was visiting Paul, who was a good friend. Sam was at our house several blocks from the Church when he heard the news of it. We advised him to go back and be with his family. We felt that if they caught him later and knew who he was, it would be harder on him. He went home, and was picked up with his family. Sometime later the soldiers tortured and beheaded his mother along with several others.

After being bedridden for the next two years, in March 1890 Norris was converted to a saving knowledge of Christ.Melodie Sides, \\"Rev. Mrs. Susan Norris Fitkin 1870-1951\\". In her autobiography Susan Norris Fitkin wrote: > Just as everything in my life, from the human standpoint, looked blackest, a > new interest was suddenly awakened.

To the displeasure of some friends and family members, after her conversion Susan Norris began attending the Union Chapel, an interdenominational church in East Farnham that was strongly evangelical in emphasis, instead of the local Church of England.!\\" According to Nazarene historian Stan Ingersol \\"Each different strain of piety nourished her spiritual development. Several encounters with life-threatening illnesses, including typhoid fever, heightened her seriousness toward religion. At times, she experienced unusual dreams and saw visions.\\" Stan Ingersol, \\"Mother of Missions: The Evangelistic Vision of Susan Norris Fitkin\\", Herald of Holiness (January 1991). Late in the summer of 1890 Norris was stricken with typhoid. In her autobiography, Fitkin described a dream she had at this time: \\"At the end of this valley was a gate with a beautiful heavenly light streaming through, and lighting up the entire scene. Oh, I was so happy! I said, 'It is not dark at all; death is only a shadow.' Then the Lord whispered to me, and asked if I wanted to go in. I replied, 'Whatever is Thy will; I would not turn my hand over to decide.'\\" When dawn broke, Norris awakened, as one who had been refreshed by hidden springs of life. She said to the family, \\"I am going to get well.\\"Susan Norris Fitkin, Grace Abounding. Gradually Norris recovered her health during the next few months. In December 1890 Norris had a vision of Christ's Second Coming where she was intensely happy until she realized that many people would not be going to heaven. In her autiobiography Norris described her vision of Christ: \\"I ran to the door to meet Him when I was startled with loud wailing cries, and looking back, I saw most of the people on their faces, crying out in fear and anguish.\\" Norris claimed that after she woke that she became conscious of the presence of Jesus: \\"It was like a person standing by my bed and in an audible voice saying solemnly: 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.'\\"Susie C. Stanley, Holy Boldness: Women Preachers' Autobiographies (Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2004):102-103. Consequently, Norris believed God was calling her to be a missionary preacher. However, when she offered herself as a missionary to the Toronto headquarters of the China Inland Mission in 1891, Norris was refused for health reasons. Norris later indicated she came across Ezekiel 3:5 and the words jumped out at her: \\"For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language.\\" Norris accepted this an indication that God did not want her to go to a foreign land as a missionary. ===Consecration=== In April 1891 Susan Norris was employed as a dressmaker and living on her widowed mother's farm in Farnham East with her an older sister Anna, and six younger siblings.Source Information: Ancestry.com. 1891 Census of Canada [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2008.Source Citation: Year: 1891; Census Place: Farnham East, Brome, Quebec; Roll: T-6388; Family No: 121. In 1891 visiting English evangelists, who were staying in her family home, led Norris into a deeper relationship with God. On the flyleaf of her Bible she wrote her consecration creed, which \\"helped and steadied me many times through the coming years.\\" This was as follows: \\"My Consecration -- I am willing-- To take what Thou givest; To lack what Thou withholdest; To relinquish what Thou takest; To go where Thou commandest; To be what Thou requirest; I am, O Lord, wholly and forever Thine.\\" Soon after Norris began conducting services for youth in her community and then, at her mother's urging, in other communities. Out of this, her ministry as an evangelist began emerging around 1892. In Summer 1892 Norris was elected by her local Christian Endeavor Society to be a delegate to the first world convention of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavour at Madison Square Garden in New York City, where she met J. Walter Malone (born August 11, 1857 near Marathon, Ohio; died December 30, 1935 in Cleveland Ohio),Charles Edwin Jones, The Wesleyan Holiness Movement: A Comprehensive Guide.

See \\"Changes to the Structure of The Society of Friends\\" , Southwest Ohio Research Genealogical & Historical Research.Cleveland Bible College. Despite her precarious health and opposition from some of her siblings, in the fall of 1892 Norris enrolled a few weeks late in the first academic class at Malone's school, also known as Friends' Bible Institute and Training School (and now as Malone University). Among her classmates was Mary Emily Soule (born August 12, 1869 in Dunham, Quebec, Canada; died June 26, 1943 in Vicksburg, Michigan),Charles Edwin Jones, The Wesleyan Holiness Movement: A Comprehensive Guide. (Scarecrow Press, 2005):1100. a fellow Canadian Quaker, who with her husband Edgar Ellyson, also became prominent leaders in the Church of the Nazarene. Shortly after joining Cleveland's Friends, Norris became \\"seriously ill with cancer. She was anointed and prayed for by J. Walter and Emma B. Malone, and it pleased the Lord to answer prayer and heal her.\\"W. T. Purkiser, Called Unto Holiness, Vol. 2.

Susie Norris Fitkin by the Board of Trustees of Cleveland Bible College, October 31st, 1951 in the Malone College Archives. Believing that God had healed her of cancer, Norris began preaching in revivals. ==Early ministry== In 1893, Norris became pastor of a church in Vermont where she had previously held revival meetings. Another pastorate followed in Vermont. Norris was listed as a \\"recorded\\" (or official) minister in the Friends Church. ===Evangelistic ministry=== In 1895, at the urging of one of the leading leading New York Quakers, Norris returned to evangelism. At a camp meeting in the Methodist Episcopal Church in Clintondale, New York, Norris claimed to be entirely sanctified.Susan Norris Fitkin, Grace Much More Abounding: A Story of the Triumphs of Redeeming Grace During Two Score Years in the Master's Service (Kansas City, MO: Nazarene Publishing House, n.d. Holiness Data Ministry, 1997):12-14,Basil Miller, Susan N. Fitkin: For God and Missions. Digital ed. (Holiness Data Ministry, 2006):26-29. Norris had sought the experience of entire sanctification and had previously claimed it by faith several times, and had preached often on the doctrine, but was still unsatisfied in her experience.Susie C. Stanley, Holy Boldness: Women Preachers' Autobiographies (Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2004):75. Norris desired \\"to be sanctified wholly, cleansed from inherited sin, the old man cast out, the carnal nature destroyed, and to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire.\\"Susan Norris Fitkin, in Susie C. Stanley, Holy Boldness: Women Preachers' Autobiographies (Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2004):67. After, what she later described as a \\"battle with the enemy\\", at the conclusion of the service Norris responded to the altar call and claimed the experience despite an absence of emotion.Susie C. Stanley, Holy Boldness: Women Preachers' Autobiographies (Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2004):75-76. At the camp meeting where she was sanctified entirely, Norris met Abram Fitkin, a Quaker evangelist. For the next six months Norris was teamed with Abram,See, for example, \\"Cornwall\\", Newburgh Daily Journal (February 17, 1896):4. pursuing an itinerant ministry in New York state; Norris borrowed books on holiness from Abram, and the pair were able to convert many to their church through their ministryall the while finding themselves falling in love.Basil Miller, Susan N.

According to Basil Miller: \\"The lad Raleigh was to play an important role in the family's missionary future. ... [T]he boy's interest in missions prompted his father Abram to build at a cost of thousands of dollars the Raleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital in Africa\\".

Church located in Milton, North Carolina.Piedmont Triad News-Record, \\"Midwife on Trial,\\" November 19, 1999, p D1. ==Biography== Henrietta Phelps was born the daughter of a slave, Elija \\"Phelps\\", and Charlotte Ann Bennett, a midwife. Henrietta was the oldest daughter in a family of 7 children. She grew up in her family home with her parents until her first marriage to George Lawson of Milton, North Carolina, on January 21, 1872, at the age of 15. The marriage produced a son, George, Jr. Henrietta was widowed by age 22. She subsequently married James Allen Jeffries, a tobacco farmer of Leasburg, North Carolina, in Milton town, Caswell County, on July 30, 1881. Henrietta had 11 children with Allen Jeffries (as he was informally known), and was mother to 18 children total. The family resided in Milton, North Carolina. Henrietta was literate, able to read, and listed the nature of her occupation as \\"doctress\\", working on her own account as a \\"midwife\\", according to the 1910 U.S. Census.1910 United States Federal Census Record for \\"Heriette Jeffreys\\", Caswell and Semora Counties, District 0025. She is recorded having birthed \\"hundreds of children, both black and white\\" throughout Caswell County, North Carolina. It appears that Henrietta learned midwifery from her mother, who was also a midwife. Henrietta Phelps Lawson Jeffries died of chronic nephritis on August 22, 1926. She is buried at Macedonia A.M.E. Church on Yarborough Road in Milton, North Carolina. In 1985, Mrs. Henrietta Jeffries was listed as one of the \\"First Ladies of Caswell County, Past and Present.Whitlow, Jeannine D., Editor.

Page 680. ==Trial== Henrietta was brought to trial on charges of \\"practicing medicine without a license\\" in 1911. The penalty, at the time in U.S. history, if convicted, was death by hanging. Jeffries' trial was a historic event for the small town of Milton, NC, as it gained national attention in the press of that time. The jury was an all-white, all-male bench. The judge in the case listened to an unrepresented Henrietta defend herself based on her Christian faith. The judge then dismissed himself from the bench, came down and stood beside Mrs. Jeffries, defended her cause, and then as judge, overrode any jury decision, and dismissed the charges.When the Past Refused to Die: A History of Caswell County North Carolina 1777-1977, William S. Powell (1977) at 534-537. Such a trial dismissal was unprecedented for an American woman of color during the early part of the 20th century. Henrietta Jeffries continued her profession as midwife until her natural death in 1926. The trial has been recorded in William S.

Simon (1916‚Äì2001). It asserts that \\"decision-making is the heart of administration, and that the vocabulary of administrative theory must be derived from the logic and psychology of human choice\\", and it attempts to describe administrative organizations \\"in a way that will provide the basis for scientific analysis\\". The first edition was published in 1947; the second, in 1957; the third, in 1976; and the fourth, in 1997. As summarized in a 2001 obituary of Simon, the book \\"reject[ed] the notion of an omniscient 'economic man' capable of making decisions that bring the greatest benefit possible and substitut[ed] instead the idea of 'administrative man' who 'satisfices‚Äîlooks for a course of action that is satisfactory'\\". Administrative Behavior laid the foundation for the economic movement known as the Carnegie School. The book crosses social science disciplines such as political science and economics. Simon returned to some of the ideas in the book in his later works, such as The Sciences of the Artificial (1969). The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited the book as \\"epoch-making\\" in awarding the 1978 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to Simon. A 1990 article in Public Administration Review named it the \\"public administration book of the half century\\" (1940-1990). It was voted the fifth most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management. ==Background== The book is based on Simon's doctoral thesis in political science at the University of Chicago, which he began planning in 1937. At the time, the chair of the political science department was Charles Edward Merriam. Beginning in 1936, Simon worked as a half-time research assistant and then as a full-time staff member at the International City Managers Association (ICMA). Among other activities at ICMA, he learned about administration and about scientific collaboration from director Clarence Ridley, and published his first book with Ridley in 1938. Although Simon cites Ridley as a major influence on his thinking, Simon did not actually work on his thesis while at ICMA. Simon took a position at the Bureau of Public Administration at the University of California, Berkeley between 1939 and 1942. It was at Berkeley that he completed his University of Chicago Ph.D. thesis, which was approved by a committee consisting of Leonard D. White, C. Herman Pritchett, Clarence Ridley, and Charner Marquis Perry. Simon received his doctorate in 1942. ==Influences== In writing his thesis and book, Simon was influenced by The Functions of the Executive (1938) by Chester I. Barnard. In his 1991 autobiography, Simon wrote that he found Barnard's book \\"wholly superior to the other administrative literature of the day and fully compatible with my preference for looking at management in decision- making terms\\". The book, which Simon read \\"with painstaking care\\", motivated Simon to reflect upon his experiences and to focus on administrative decision making. In a 1988 interview, Simon was quoted as follows: > Of course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted > to him; science is a cumulative endeavor...In the book itself there are > fourteen references to Barnard...the notions of the contribution-inducement > equilibrium, authority, and zone of acceptance were all derived from > Barnard...What I would now regard as the principal novelties in > Administative [sic] Behavior are the development of the concept of > organizational identification...the description of the decision process in > terms of the processing of decision premises, and the bounded rationality > notions...Most of the rest is highly \\"Barnardian\\", and certainly even those > \\"novel\\" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of > organizations. Mitchell and Scott have noted similarities in Barnard's and Simon's concepts of authority, organizational equilibrium, and decision making. For example, Barnard's \\"zone of indifference\\" (a subordinate's unquestioned acceptance of authority) became Simon's \\"zone of acceptance\\". In addition, Mitchell and Scott concluded that both Simon and Barnard believed that large organizations control individuals' behavior and manipulate their opinions. Philosophers who influenced Simon include William James, John Dewey, A. J. Ayer, and Rudolf Carnap. The ideas of behavioral psychologist Edward C. Tolman and sociologist Talcott Parsons also contributed to Simon's work. Simon characterized his own philosophical approach as logical positivism. ==EditionsPreliminary (1945)=== In 1945, when Simon was at the Illinois Institute of Technology, he sent mimeographed copies of a preliminary version of the book (which was similar to his thesis) to about 200 people he thought might be interested in his work. One of the recipients of the preliminary version was Barnard. Although Simon did not know Barnard personally, Barnard sent a total of 25 pages of detailed comments to Simon, which resulted in a thorough revision of the book. Simon then asked Barnard to write the book's foreword. ===1st (1947)=== The first edition had 16 pages of front matter (e.g., a Foreword by Chester Barnard, a Preface, and Acknowledgements), as well as 259 pages of body matter (i.e., Chapters I-XI) and back matter (Appendix and Index). The published first edition was different from the preliminary version in many ways, including: * Mathematical appendices and a comparison of rats and humans in organizations was removed * The chapters were rearranged, with \\"Some Problems of Administrative Theory\\" moved up to Chapter II * Some discussion of logical positivism was deleted * There was more discussion of communication within organizations * Material that could be considered \\"political\\" (e.g., passages that appeared to support New Deal economics) had been taken out In the Foreword, Barnard states that Simon's conclusions are \\"consonant with [his] experience\\" as an executive, and expresses hope that \\"ultimately it may be possible to state principles of general organization\\". In the Acknowledgements, Simon thanked Barnard for The Functions of the Executive, for \\"the extremely careful critical review he gave the preliminary version of this book\\", and for his Foreword. ===2nd (1957)=== The second edition featured a new Introduction, causing the book to contain 48 pages of front matter and 259 pages of body and back matter. The Introduction summarized the book's structure, suggested how practitioners might apply the book's lessons, discussed the concepts of rational behavior and satisficing, commented on specific chapters in the book, and provided recent references. ===3rd (1976)=== The third edition, which had 50 pages of front matter and 364 pages of body and back matter, placed the original Chapters I-XI and Appendix into a Part I. Its \\"Part II\\" consisted of six new chapters (XII through XVII) based on articles that Simon had written: * XII: \\"On the Concept of Organizational Goal\\" (pages 257-278), originally published in 1964 * XIII: \\"The Future of Information-Processing Technology\\" (pages 279-287), originally published in 1968 * XIV: \\"Applying Information Technology to Organization Design\\" (pages 288-308), originally published in 1973 * XV: \\"Selective Perception: the Identifications of Executives (with DeWitt C. Dearborn)\\" (pages 309-314), originally published in 1958 * XVI: \\"The Birth of an Organization\\" (pages 315-324), originally published in 1953 * XVII: \\"The Business School: a Problem in Organizational Design\\" (pages 335-356), originally published in 1967 ===4th (1997)=== Cover of 4th edition (1997); note change of subtitle to \\"...Organizations\\" For the fourth edition, with 15 pages of front matter and 368 pages of body and back matter, the last word in the subtitle was changed from \\"Organization\\" to \\"Organizations\\". The fourth edition lacked Barnard's foreword which had been present in the first through third editions. Instead of the third edition's lengthy Introduction and Part II, in the fourth edition the Introduction was briefer and Simon's commentaries followed each chapter of the original text. ==Summaries of Chapters I-XI and Appendix == The text and pagination of the 253 pages of Chapters I-XI and of the Appendix (\\"What Is an Administrative Science?\\") were the same in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions. Although the text of Chapters I-XI and the Appendix was the same in the 4th edition, the pagination was different. === Chapter I. Decision-Making and Administrative Organization=== This chapter was based on a 1944 article with the same name in Public Administration Review. Simon distinguishes between \\"value judgments\\" (which \\"lead toward the selection of final goals\\") and \\"factual judgments\\" (which \\"involve the implementation of such goals\\"), a topic which he explores more fully in Chapter III. The relationship of the individual and the group in decision-making is explored; for example, influences upon individuals include authority, organizational loyalty, efficiency, advice and information, and training. === Chapter II. Some Problems of Administrative Theory === Based on a 1946 article in Public Administration Review entitled \\"The Proverbs of Administration\\", Chapter II is notable for the following passage near its beginning: > It is a fatal defect of the current principles of administration that, like > proverbs, they occur in pairs. For almost every principle one can find an > equally plausible and acceptable contradictory principle. Although the two > principles of the pair will lead to exactly opposite organizational > recommendations, there is nothing in the theory to indicate which is the > proper one to apply. To substantiate this criticism, it is necessary to > examine briefly some of the leading principles. # Administrative efficiency > is increased by a specialization of the task among the group # > Administrative efficiency is increased by arranging the members of the group > in a determinate hierarchy of authority # Administrative efficiency is > increased by limiting the span of control at any point in the hierarchy to a > small number # Administrative efficiency is increased by grouping the > workers These principles were found in the 1937 book Papers on the Science of Administration edited by Luther Gulick and Lyndall Urwick. After pointing out the shortcomings in the four principles, such as ambiguities and lack of empirical evidence, Simon states that \\"over-all efficiency must be the guiding criterion\\" in administrative organizations and that scientific methods must be applied to determine how to improve that efficiency. === Chapter III. Fact and Value in Decision-Making=== Chapter III \\"clarifies foundational aspects of the logic of choice.\\" The first section of the chapter provides details for the explanation in Chapter I of \\"facts\\" versus \\"values\\". The chapter's second section on \\"Policy and Administration\\" discusses how the legislative and executive branches of government apply facts and values. === Chapter IV. Rationality in Administrative Behavior=== After considering how the ideas of means and ends relate to decision-making, Simon distinguishes among \\"objectively\\", \\"subjectively\\", \\"consciously\\", \\"deliberately\\", \\"organizationally\\", and \\"personally\\" rational decisions. === Chapter V. The Psychology of Administrative Decisions=== In the first part of this chapter, \\"The Limits of Rationality\\", Simon wrote: > Actual behavior falls short, in at least three ways, of objective > rationality‚Ä¶: :(1) Rationality requires a complete knowledge and > anticipation of the consequences that will follow on each choice. In fact, > knowledge of consequences is always fragmentary. :(2) Since these > consequences lie in the future, imagination must supply the lack of > experienced feeling in attaching value to them. But values can be only > imperfectly anticipated. :(3) Rationality requires a choice among all > possible alternative behaviors. In actual behavior, only a very few of all > these possible alternatives ever come to mind. The remainder of the chapter concerns \\"Purposive Behavior in the Individual\\" and \\"The Integration of Behavior\\". === Chapter VI. The Equilibrium of the Organization=== As summarized by Simon in the 4th edition's \\"Commentary on Chapter VI\\", the central idea of this chapter is that \\"the survival and success of organizations depend on their providing sufficient incentives to their members to secure the contributions that are needed to carry out the organizations' tasks\\". === Chapter VII. The Role of Authority=== Chapters VII-X deal with four ways in which an organization can influence an individual's decisions. In Chapter VII, Simon discusses the nature of authority and how it is used in organizations: for enforcing responsibility, for obtaining decision-making expertise, and for coordinating activity. Four methods are described for avoiding conflicts in authority when a subordinate has multiple superiors. === Chapter VIII. Communication=== Simon defines communication as \\"any process whereby decisional premises are transmitted from one member of an organization to another\\". Communication can be formal or informal, may need to be archived to provide \\"memory\\" for an organization, and is sometimes accomplished through training. The 4th edition's \\"Commentary on Chapter VIII\\" discusses computerized communications which were unavailable in 1947. === Chapter IX. The Criterion of Efficiency=== This chapter expands upon a concept that had been mentioned briefly in preceding chapters. In a for- profit organization, the \\"criterion of efficiency\\" states than an individual will select an alternative that will maximize income and minimize cost so as to \\"yield the greatest net (money) return to the organization\\". More generally (i.e., to include nonprofit organizations) the criterion causes \\"that choice of alternatives which produces the largest result for the given application of resources.\\" In the remainder of the chapter, Simon counters criticisms of the efficiency criterion and outlines methods by which efficiency can be attained (e.g., by \\"functionalization\\" and by the public budgeting process). === Chapter X. Loyalties and Organizational Identification=== Following a concept of Harold Lasswell, Simon asserts that \\"a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group.\\" Such organizational identification can be associated with decisions that are not optimal in terms of an organization's efficiency or adequacy (\\"the degree to which its goals have been reached\\"). === Chapter XI. The Anatomy of Organization=== Simon describes the organizational decision-making process and writes: > The need for an administrative theory resides in the fact that there are > practical limits to human rationality, and that these limits are not static, > but depend upon the organizational environment in which the individual's > decision takes place. The task of administration is so to design this > environment that the individual will approach as close as practicable to > rationality (judged in terms of the organization's goals) in his decisions. === Appendix: What Is an Administrative Science?=== In the final part of the book common to all editions, Simon discusses the \\"theoretical\\" (descriptive) aspects and \\"practical\\" aspects (i.e., leading toward the improved attainment of objectives) of the science of administration. ==Criticism== * Robert A. Dahl wrote in 1947 that a science of organizations was impossible due to cultural differences among organizations. Similarly, a 1957 review of the second edition questioned whether scientific studies of important aspects of organizational decision-making \\"under controlled conditions\\" could ever be undertaken. Simon responded to the 1957 review that \\"as knowledge advances...administrative practice will come to rest largely on scientifically tested knowledge of fundamental underlying mechanisms\\". * The book played a central role in what is known as the \\"Simon-Waldo debate\\" published in the American Political Science Review in 1952. Using \\"purple prose\\", Simon and Dwight Waldo exchanged articles in which Simon \\"accuse[d] Waldo of logical unrigor\\" while Waldo \\"charge[d] Simon with philosophical myopia\\" due to Simon's reliance on logical positivism in Administrative Behavior. * In 1962 Herbert Storing edited a book entitled Essays on the Scientific Study of Politics; one of the essays therein, by Storing himself, critiqued Administrative Behavior. In his autobiography, Simon wrote that the essays in Storing's book \\"were such egregious examples of the practice of reading texts unsympathetically and without a genuine attempt to understand them that [he] never felt an urge to respond to them\\". One analysis notes differences in Storing's and Simon's styles of thinking (\\"dichotomous\\" versus \\"synthetic\\"), levels of abstraction, and \\"assumed 'goodness' of organizations\\". * Simon does not offer any convincing replacement for the principles of organization that he critiques. * Simon's introductions and commentaries in the second through fourth editions interpret material in the first edition in a way that stretches its meaning or contradicts it. For example, Simon saw \\"satisficing man\\" in the 1947 text but other authors saw \\"maximizing man\\". * The fact/value and policy/administration distinctions have been criticized as unnecessary. * The book minimizes the role of emotions and habit in organizations. * Simon did not analyze how immoral behavior, such as police corruption, can occur within organizations. * A 1990 essay asserts that Chapter II (\\"Some Problems of Administrative Theory\\") did not criticize Gulick's work fairly in that Gulick already recognized most of the problems that Simon discussed. ==Legacy== Simon felt that the reviews of the first edition \\"were generally kind, but the reviewers were not exhilerated [sic]\\", and that the book \\"created no sensation\\" at first. Nevertheless, it became notable for the following innovations: * A scientific approach to administration. * A focus on organizational decision making as the basis for organizational action, as opposed to John Dewey who emphasized habit and action. * The initial description of what would later be called \\"bounded rationality,\\" a term that one paper concludes first appeared in Simon's 1957 book Models of Man, In the 1st edition of Administrative Behavior, Simon used the phrases ‚Äúlimits to rationality‚Äù or ‚Äúlimits of rationality.‚Äù * The initial description of what a 1956 paper by Simon called satisficing. As stated in the Introductions to the 2nd and 3rd editions, and in the 4th edition's \\"Commentary on Chapter V\\": > The central concern of administrative theory is with the boundary between > the rational and the nonrational aspects of human social behavior. > Administrative theory is peculiarly the theory of intended and bounded > rationality ‚Äì of the behavior of human beings who satisfice because they > have not the wits to maximize. :Later in the 2nd through 4th editions, \\"to satisfice\\" is defined as \\"to look[] for a course of action that is satisfactory or 'good enough.'\\" The word is not used in the 1st edition of Administrative Behavior, but the index to the 3rd edition indicates that pertinent passages are found in the 1st edition on pages 38-41, 80-81, and 240-244. * The concept of organizational identification in Chapter X. Simon would return to the concepts from Administrative Behavior in later books that he co-authored, including Public Administration (with Donald W. Smithburg and Victor A. Thompson, 1950); Organizations (with James G. March, 1958); and The Sciences of the Artificial (1969). Among books written by other authors, Administrative Behavior influenced: * The Forest Ranger, a Study in Administrative Behavior by Herbert Kaufman (1960). * A Behavioral Theory of the Firm by Richard Cyert and James G. March (1963). Together, Simon (1947), March and Simon (1958), and Cyert and March (1963) are considered the \\"foundational works\\" for the \\"Carnegie School\\" of organizational decision-making and economics based at Carnegie Mellon University. * Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis by Graham T. Allison (1971), specifically the \\"organizational process model\\" explanation for the crisis. In 1978, Sune Carlson said in a speech at the ceremony awarding Simon a Nobel Prize in Economics: > ‚Ä¶the study of the structure and the decision-making of the firm became an > important task in economic science. ‚Ä¶ In his epoch-making book > Administrative Behavior, which first appeared in 1947 and which has been > translated into nearly a dozen languages, as well as in a number of > subsequent works, Simon describes the company as an adaptive system of > physical, personal and social components, which are held together by a > network of intercommunications and by the willingness of its members to co- > operate and to work towards common goals. ‚Ä¶ Nevertheless, it was reported that economists Albert Ando and William Baumol had \\"made little reference to Administrative Behavior\\" in arguing to the Nobel Prize Committee that Simon should win. Between 1955 and 1988, the book was translated into 12 languages: Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. A set of 12 papers about the book appeared in Public Administration Quarterly in 1988-1989 for the book's 40th anniversary. In 1990, Sherwood reported in Public Administration Review that 19 of 20 members of an informal advisory panel voted Administrative Behavior one of the \\"five or six most influential\\" books in academic public administration published between 1940 and 1990, making it the \\"public administration book of the half century.\\" It was the \\"overwhelming leader\\" among the books nominated, receiving \\"twice as many nominations as any other book.\\" Despite over 150,000 copies of the book having been sold in English, in a small survey of recent graduates from a Master of Public Administration program, Sherwood found widespread belief in the administrative proverbs that Simon attempted to discredit in Chapter II. The fourth edition of the book was released in 1997; its Introduction noted the book's \\"fiftieth birthday.\\" The book was cited in obituaries of Simon in 2001. By 2009, the book had received 7,746 citations on Google Scholar. Of the articles that cited the book, the articles that were most-cited concerned organizational learning, the economic sociology, transaction cost economics, and organizational decision making. Administrative Behavior appeared in at least three lists of \\"best\\" or \\"most influential\\" management and business books between 2001 and 2011. As of 2012, the fourth edition of the book is still in print. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * * * Category:1947 non-fiction books Category:Business books Category:Organizational behavior Category:Public administration books ","title":"Administrative Behavior"},{"id":"35870857","text":"Bjorn Kristensen (also spelt Bj√∏rn Kristensen; born 5 April 1993) is a Maltese international footballer who plays for Hibernians, as a midfielder. ==Early and personal life== Kristensen has a Danish father and Maltese mother.

Similarly to the uniform polyhedra and the uniform tilings, eight uniform tilings may be based from the regular apeirogonal tiling. The rectified and cantellated forms are duplicated, and as two times infinity is also infinity, the truncated and omnitruncated forms are also duplicated, therefore reducing the number of unique forms to four: the apeirogonal tiling, the apeirogonal hosohedron, the apeirogonal prism, and the apeirogonal antiprism. == See also == * Order-3 apeirogonal tiling - hyperbolic tiling * Order-4 apeirogonal tiling - hyperbolic tiling ==NotesReferences== * The Symmetries of Things 2008, John H.

In 1782 these two societies were merged and also began to produce plays, which Loosjes wrote, acted, and published himself, becoming a Haarlem bookseller. In the same year Jan van Walr√© joined to become an actor, and under his influence, in 1785 the society was reinvented as the theater society Leerzaam vermaak with a strong Patriotic bias with Loosjes and Walr√© the leaders. When the House of Orange briefly enjoyed a contrarevolution, Leerzaam vermaak was banned, and Loosjes decided to avoid politics and relinquished his official roles in the group, spending his time on scientific and writing pursuits. In 1789 he started the Haarlem scientific society Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen. To continue with his comedies, he began the society Democriet in the same year with the remark Because Heraclitus had to cry, Democritus had to laugh. In 1790 Walr√© joined, who again added political color, despite Loosjes' intentions to remain neutral. In 1795 when the French occupation began, the activities of Democriet reached their peak, and after that moment the society began to show similarities with freemasonry. Loosjes wrote several books and plays, and translated historical works from English into Dutch. He succeeded his father Petrus Loosjes as a member of Teylers Eerste Genootschap from 1813 until his own death in 1818. His son Vincent Loosjes continued his publishing business.

The Nature Coast State Trail (NCST) is a 31.7-mile long segment of Florida's Statewide System of Greenways and Trails System built along abandoned railroad tracks, and designated by the U.S. Department of the Interior as a National Recreation Trail. It has two primary sections following unused rail lines that were originally built by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. It includes historic sites such as an old train trestle bridge over the Suwannee River near Old Town and train stations in Trenton, Cross City, and Chiefland. At Wilcox Junction abandoned rail tracks cross and connect with several communities. The trail is available to hikers, cyclists, and horse riders. ==History== Florida has many abandoned railway tracks in the Suwannee River Valley. In the early 1900s freight and passenger steamships were replaced by trains that carried crops and timber and also made passenger stops in small towns such as Chiefland, Cross City, and Trenton. The Nature Coast Trail follows this historic route. The 31.7 miles of the Nature Coast State Trail connects several counties and five communities (Cross City, Trenton, Fanning Springs Old Town and Chiefland). In 2010, then-Florida governor Charlie Crist approved the purchase a 9.33-mile corridor, known as the Trenton-Newberry Rail Trail.

Brusca's men carried out test drives, using flashbulbs to simulate detonating the blast on a speeding car, and a concrete structure was specially created and destroyed in an experimental explosion to see if the bomb would be powerful enough. Leoluca Bagarella assisted at the scene during preparations.Follain, Vendetta, p. 74 Brusca detonated the device by remote control from a small outbuilding on a hill to the right of the highway on 23 May 1992.

Owned by the News-Press & Gazette Company, it is a sister station to fellow flagship properties, Fox affiliate KNPN-LD (channel 26) and CBS affiliate KCJO-LD (channel 30). The three stations share studios at News-Press & Gazette's corporate headquarters (which also house operations for the St. Joseph News-Press and local news and weather channel News-Press NOW) on Edmond Street in downtown St. JosephFox Station Coming to St. Joseph, Mo., Broadcasting & Cable, March 20, 2012. and transmitter facilities on South 16th Street (adjacent to US 36), just southeast of downtown. There are no separate websites for the three stations, instead they are integrated with that of the co-owned St. Joseph News-Press. ==HistoryEarly history=== The station's history traces back to the September 21, 1998 launch of a cable- only affiliate of The WB that was originally managed and promoted by St. Joseph Cablevision (a cable television provider that was owned by the News- Press & Gazette Company), alongside the launch of The WB 100+ Station Group, a service similar to The CW Plus that was created to expand national coverage of The WB via primarily local origination channels managed by cable providers in markets ranked above #100 by Nielsen Media Research. Since it was a cable- exclusive outlet that was not licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, the channel used the callsign \\"WBJO\\" in a fictional manner. Before the sign-on of the cable-only WBJO, viewers in the St. Joseph, Missouri area received their WB network programs, via Superstation WGN, and in September 1996, KCWB when the station began broadcasting, then from KSMO-TV when that station dropped UPN and picked up the WB from KCWB, in which it changed the call letters to KCWE two years later. On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down their respective networks, The WB and UPN, to create The CW Television Network, which would feature programs from its two predecessors as well as new series that were specifically produced for The CW.'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September, CNNMoney.com, January 24, 2006. The CW Plus was created by the network as a replacement for The WB 100+ Station Group to allow the existing cable outlets as well as low- power analog stations and digital subchannels of major network affiliates in smaller markets that had joined The WB 100+ in the years following its launch to maintain a network affiliation; \\"WBJO\\" affiliated with The CW Plus on September 18, 2006 upon the launch of the CW network. Prior to the launch of KNPN-LD, residents in the St. Joseph market who received programming over-the- air or subscribed to other television providers besides Suddenlink viewed CW programming through out-of-market stations: some rural cable systems carried KCWE from the nearby Kansas City market (which provides at least grade B signal coverage to much of the St. Joseph market); the default CW outlet for local DirecTV subscribers was Omaha's KXVO, while Dish Network carried New York City affiliate WPIX, Los Angeles affiliate KTLA and Denver affiliate KWGN-TV as default affiliates through their carriage on its superstation package in lieu of regional affiliates located within proximity to St. Joseph. Upon the sale of News-Press & Gazette Company's cable television operations (which served St. Joseph, and parts of Arizona and California) to Suddenlink Communications in 2011 for $350 million,Suddenlink to buy NPG Cable for $350M, St. Louis Business Journal, November 29, 2010. Suddenlink also acquired ownership of \\"WBJO\\" and sister cable outlet News-Press 3 NOW. On March 19, 2012, News-Press & Gazette Company announced that it would launch a Fox- affiliated television station in St. Joseph to serve as the flagship of its television station group, which would also carry affiliations with The CW and Spanish-language network Telemundo on digital subchannels;NPG bringing FOX station to St. Joe, St. Joseph News-Press, March 19, 2012. the station was created using the license of K26LV-D (now KNPN-LD).Weekly Station Trading Roundup: New York LPTV Goes For $2 Million, TVNewsCheck, February 14, 2012.FCC document for transfer of K16KF-D and K26LV-D, March 14, 2012. On June 1, 2012, News-Press & Gazette Company confirmed that The CW Plus would be carried on its third digital subchannel, retaining the \\"St. Joseph‚Äôs CW 6\\" branding; although the satellite providers carry KNPN's main signal, DirecTV and Dish Network did not sign carriage agreements to offer KNPN-LD3 (and subsequently KBJO-LD), CW programming continued to be offered through out-of-market stations as a result.Fox 26 KNPN Coverage Area The subchannel officially debuted at 6:00 a.m. on June 2, 2012, with News-Press & Gazette assuming promotional and advertising control of \\"WBJO\\" from Suddenlink Communications with the subsequent sign-on of KNPN-LD digital subchannel 26.3. It remained available on Suddenlink cable channel 6 (a high definition feed of the channel was also provided to Suddenlink subscribers on digital cable channel 606).Fox station to debut on June 2 , St. Joseph News-Press, May 17, 2012. ===KNPG-LD history=== As KBJO-LD On March 14, 2012, concurrent with its acquisition of K26LV-D, News-Press & Gazette also purchased the low-power digital license of K16KF-D from DTV America 1, LLC of Sunrise, Florida; the purchase price for both stations was $72,000. Two weeks earlier on February 29, the FCC granted the company's construction permit application to relocate the two stations' transmitter facilities from a tower near Mound City to the St. Joseph transmitter and upgrade the effective radiated power of both stations.FCC Construction Permit information for K16KF-D, February 29, 2012.FCC Construction Permit information for K26LV-D, February 29, 2012. Channel 16 first signed on the air on March 7, 2013, concurrent with the change of K16KF-D's callsign to KBJO-LD (adapted from the predecessor cable channel's branding).Resumption of Operations for KBJO-LD Concurrent with KBJO's sign-on, KNPN-LD dropped CW programming from its second subchannel.KNPN to upgrade transmission to all HD, St. Joseph News-Press, March 5, 2013. Low- powered television stations are exempt from the must-carry and retransmission consent regulations that full-powered stations enjoy, meaning that its carriage on other area cable systems besides Suddenlink, and satellite providers is not guaranteed. Switch to NBC affiliation as KNPG-LD On August 18, 2016, the News-Press & Gazette Company announced that it had reached an affiliation agreement with NBC, under which channel 21 would become the network's affiliate for the St. Joseph market, giving the market its first locally based NBC affiliate. Concurrent with the change, the station's call letters would be changed from KBJO-LD to KNPG-LD, which had been assigned to its Telemundo-affiliated sister station on channel 30. On November 1 of that year, when the callsign and network affiliation change took effect, the CW Plus affiliation moved to a newly created subchannel on virtual channel 21.2; the KBJO-LD callsign was transferred to its sister station on channel 30.Kansas City Radio & TV blog KNPG-LD displaced KSHB-TV (channel 41) ‚Äì which is among the seven full-power Kansas City stations that provide city-grade signal coverage in St. Joseph proper ‚Äì as the area's default NBC station on Suddenlink Communications, DirecTV and Dish Network. However, KSHB ‚Äì which has served as the network's default affiliate for St. Joseph since it assumed the NBC affiliation from WDAF-TV (channel 4) in September 1994 ‚Äì continues to act as an alternate NBC affiliate for the market as its transmitter produces a city-grade signal that reaches St. Joseph proper; however, the switch resulted in NBC programs carried on KSHB being blacked out to comply with programming duplication regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The move left CBS and MyNetworkTV as the outliers among the six major broadcast networks without a local affiliate in St. Joseph. Subsequently, on June 1, 2017, KNPG took over the local affiliation rights to Telemundo, which had been carried on its sister station on channel 30 (as KBJO-LD) until it converted into a CBS affiliate as KCJO-LD on that date, through the activation of a new third subchannel. ==Digital televisionDigital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - !

The news department shared by KNPG, KNPN-LD and KCJO-LD also utilizes reporting and coverage resources from the St. Joseph News-Press, and also shares content with co-owned local news channel News-Press NOW, with all news programming carried by the properties produced in-house at the station's Edmond Street studios. As KBJO-LD, the station did not broadcast any newscasts from parent station KNPN-LD (being a CW affiliate at the time, channel 21 would have been precluded from airing much news programming in any event, since Fox affiliate KNPN already produced morning and prime time newscasts that air in time periods where stations affiliated with Fox and The CW typically carry local news as neither network has a morning news-talk program or a third hour of prime time network programming on weekdays). However, after News-Press and Gazette relaunched channel 21 as NBC affiliate KNPG-LD on November 1, 2016, KNPN began providing simulcasts of local news programs originating on that station as well as additional newscasts produced exclusively for KNPG, using the former's existing news department staff. On that date, it began simulcasting the first 90 minutes of KNPN's weekday morning newscast (which runs on that station for 2¬Ω hours, with the remaining hour airing exclusively on channel 26 as KNPG airs Today during the 7:00 a.m. hour of the broadcast) and its half-hour 5:00 p.m. newscast (the weekend editions of which moved to KNPG following the switch, due partly to frequent pre-emptions on channel 26 caused by predetermined or gameplay-caused overruns by Fox Sports event broadcasts). In addition, KNPG-LD also began producing exclusive half-hour newscasts at 6:00 p.m. weeknights and at 10:00 p.m. seven nights a week. CBS affiliate KCJO-LD subsequently began simulcasting all of the news programs carried by KNPG, when the former Telemundo affiliate was relaunched as a CBS station on June 1, 2017. ==See also== *Channel 16 digital TV stations in the United States *Channel 16 low-power TV stations in the United States *Channel 21 virtual TV stations in the United States ==References *www.newspressnow.com/tv/ - KNPG-LD/KNPN-LD/KCJO-LD official website *www.yourcwtv.com/partners/saintjoseph/ - \\"St. Joseph‚Äôs CW 6\\" official website * * Category:News-Press & Gazette Company Category:Television channels and stations established in 2012 NPG-LD Category:NBC network affiliates Category:NBC low-power network affiliates Category:The CW affiliates Category:Telemundo subchannel-only network affiliates Category:Bounce TV affiliates Category:Grit (TV network) affiliates Category:Digital low-power television stations Category:2012 establishments in Missouri ","title":"KNPG-LD"},{"id":"35871233","text":"The 2001 CAF Champions League Final was the final of the 2001 CAF Champions League.

Jƒ´vitindriya is identified as one of the seven universal mental factors within the Theravada abhidharma teachings. In this context, jƒ´vitindriya is defined as a mental factor that sustains the life of the citta (mind) and other mental factors it accompanies. The characteristic of jƒ´vitindriya is said to be ‚Äúceaseless watching‚Äù.Gorkom (2010), p. 51 (PDF)Gorkom (2010), Definition of jƒ´vitindriya ==DefinitionTheravada=== Bhikkhu Bodhi states: :There are two kinds of life faculty, the mental, which vitalizes the associated mental states, and the physical, which vitalizes material phenomena. The mental life faculty alone is intended as a cetasika. It has the characteristic of maintaining the associated mental states, the function of making them occur, manifestation as the establishing of their presence, and its proximate cause is the mental states to be maintained. ===Mahayana=== Within the Mahayana Buddhist teachings, there are a variety of definitions for jƒ´vitindriya. The Dharmaskandhapadashastra (an early Abhidharma work of the Sarvastivadin school) defines jƒ´vitindriya as: a faculty that persists, continues, maintains, animates, and operates what we called sentient beings.Soonil Hwang (2006), p. 80 ==Etymology== Jƒ´vita·πÉ means ‚Äúlife‚Äù, and indriya means ‚Äúcontrolling faculty‚Äù. ==See also== * Indriya * Mental factors (Buddhism) * Qi or Chi ==ReferencesSources== * * Nina van Gorkom (2010), Cetasikas, Zolag * Soonil Hwang (2006), Metaphor and Literalism in Buddhism: The Doctrinal History of Nirvana, Routledge ==External links== * Definition of jƒ´vitindriya, Nina van Gorkom * Definitions for jƒ´vitindriya, Soonil Hwang Category:Buddhist terminology Category:Buddhist philosophical concepts ","title":"Jƒ´vitindriya"},{"id":"35871418","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Little Dunkeld in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. == List == } == Key NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

The term Runet was coined in Israel in the spring of 1997 by an Israeli resident and Russian-language speaker from Baku, Azerbaijan, blogger Raffi Aslanbekov () also known in Russia as Great Uncle, an author of the online column Great Uncle's Thoughts.–ß—Ç–æ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –î—è–¥—è –¥—É–º–∞–ª 11-–≥–æ –∏—é–Ω—è 1997 –≥–æ–¥–∞ (the first known usage of the word Runet) Runet was popularized by early Internet users and was included in several dictionaries, including the spelling dictionary of the Russian Academy of Sciences, edited by V. V. Lopatin in 2001. For ordinary users, the term Runet means that the content of websites is available for Russian users without foreign language skills, or that online shops have an office in Russia (for example, Russian search engines, e-mail services, anti-viruses, dictionaries, Russian-language clones of Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, eBay, PayPal, Foursquare, etc. for usage in all post-Soviet states), so the term is related to practical usage for end users. Being on the Runet gives a company some advantage, as many local IT- companies are more successful than foreign services on the Russian market. The term can describe the situation of the 1990s to the early 2000s; foreign companies didn't want to operate in the Russian market and localize their products, so Russia-based start-ups were more attractive to Russian speaking users. Nowadays, some Russian users are not interested in usage of such services as Facebook or Google Maps because local services have more Russia- specific features and local community (VK.com, Yandex services, etc.), though many international websites have very high quality Russian localization and Google search has had full support of Russian morphology for about 10 years. These situations are more or less applicable to most of post-Soviet states and these states are using the Internet in Russian language and forming a common lingua franca community like English on the Internet. The term has been used by media, journalists and politicians on several occasions. Runet is not completely synonymous with the Internet in Russia nor Internet sites in Russian, not even with the set of sites in the .ru TLD, but more accurately refers to the sphere of Internet sites predominantly visited by Russian- speaking users, which form a part of contemporary Russian culture. Many officials of the Russian government actively use this term as a synonym for Internet in the territory of Russia, i.e. for Internet infrastructure, which is subject to Russian law (including Russian censorship laws, copyright, corporate, advertisement laws, etc.), but the Russian online community doesn't support this use of the term as millions of users use the Russian language on the Internet while living outside Russia; Russian is spoken in large parts of eastern Europe that do not fall under Russian territory. Some Russian officials automatically believe that the Russian Wikipedia is based in Russia as a business entity and try to control the content of the website or establish a Russia-based clone of Wikipedia. The country domain .ru in Russian phonology does not sound like the first syllable of the country's name, since \\"Russia\\" in Russian is called \\"Rossiya\\", with an O. The pronunciation of the word Runet is closer to the pronunciation of \\"Russian language\\" - russky yazyk [u] instead of Rossiya [–æ]. ==Historical overview== Historically the term Runet has been described in several ways. * In 2009, a Yandex report stated that Runet can pertain to sites written in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Kazakh languages, as well as sites in any language published in the 12 national domains of the original CIS nations: .am, .az, .by, .ge, .kg, .kz, .md, .ru, .su, .tj, .ua or .uz. –ö–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–Ω—Ç –†—É–Ω–µ—Ç–∞ * Russian-language Internet. According to the definition in Yandex slovari dictionary published in 2001, \\"Runet is the Russian Internet. The borders of Internet are usually not based on the \\"geographical borders\\", but rather on \\"languages\\", and therefore the term Runet is usually considered to be not only websites in .ru domain, but also all Russian-language and/or Russian-oriented websites\\". –†—É–Ω–µ—Ç: –Ø–Ω–¥–µ–∫—Å.–°–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏, –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç, 2001 \\"Economic dictionary\\" of 2009 says \\"Runet is Russian-language part of the Internet\\". –†–£–ù–ï–¢ This is a common meaning of Runet. Practically, this definition makes it the Russian-language online community of post-Soviet states and their diasporas. * .ru domain. Runet is the part of Internet, whose websites are in the top-level .ru domain. This definition would exclude Russian (language) or Russian (country) sites intentionally using other domains. Highly popular alternative domains include as \\".da\\" or \\".net\\" for humorous impact or strength of statement (as these mean yes and no, respectively, in Russian), popular havens for illegal activities like \\".me\\" (piracy) or \\".cz\\" (to avoid prosecution for facilitation of prostitution), or \\".com\\" for international expansion ‚Äì the latter being home to Russia's #2 site by Alexa rank, domestic-owned and based international social network Vk.com. * Internet in the Russian Federation.

He was educated at Brambletye School, then Sheikh Bagh Preparatory School in Kashmir, then school in Cheltenham, followed by a period as a commissioned officer in the Royal Marines form where he was invalided out in 1947, progressing to Brasenose College, Oxford. At Brasenose Wace read Agricultural Economics, switching to Botany. His later work on Tristan da Cunha led to his PhD thesis on the vegetation of Gough Island, received from Queen's University, Belfast. Wace's periods in Tristan da Cunha started with his membership as botanist of the Gough Island Scientific Survey from 1955‚Äì56. In Australia Wace made a substantial contribution to knowledge of the Australian flora, both in settled parts and in the outback. Wace married Margaret White with whom he had a son and two daughters.

His career was ended by the Knickerbocker Theater disaster (January 28, 1922), when a record snowfall collapsed the theater's flat roof, killing many. Geare was closely associated with Harry M. Crandall and with early Washington theater design. Geare's theaters include the Apollo Theatre in Martinsburg, West Virginia (1914), the Knickerbocker Theatre in Washington, D.C. (1917), the Metropolitan (1918), the York (1919), the Strand in Cumberland, Maryland (1920), and the Lincoln Theatre in Washington, D.C. (1922). He also designed the theater portion of the Southern Aid Society- Dunbar Theater Building. Geare was also the original architect selected for Washington‚Äôs Tivoli Theatre in Washington, D.C., but following the Knickerbocker disaster he was replaced by Thomas W. Lamb. Lamb was also commissioned to rebuild the Knickerbocker, afterward known as the Ambassador. The coroner's jury found that the theater victims had died because of faulty construction and design. A grand jury indicted Geare and four others for manslaughter, though none was convicted. Geare killed himself on August 20, 1927.

It derives its name from the French museler, to muzzle. The muselet often has a metal cap incorporated in the design which may show the drink maker's emblem. They are normally covered by a metal foil envelope. Muselets are also known as wirehoods or Champagne wires. ==History== When champagne was first produced the pressure of the sparkling wine was maintained by wooden plugs sealed with oil-cloth and wax. This method proved inconsistent either from leaking or blowing out of the stopper and a method of restraining the corks using cord was developed. In 1844 Adolphe Jacquesson invented the more secure method involving steel wire, however the early muselets were not easy to install and proved somewhat inconvenient to open. Further developments led to the modern muselet which is made of steel wire twisted to add strength and with a small loop of wire twisted into the lower ring which can be untwisted to release the pressure of the muselet and give access to the cork. Cortellazzi (1952) of Marmirolo were the first to produce muselets (or wirehoods) in Italy, the brilliant idea of A. Jacquesson who resolved once and for all the problem of bottling sparkling wines: losing valuable effervescence through the cork. The Cortellazzi brothers (Otello and Evangelista), owners of an artisan shop that had started its business in iron making, the brothers later specialised in the manufacture of wirehoods for Spumante sparkling wine bottles thanks to their invention of the first machine that produces these components out of a single metal wire. ==Modern muselets== Traditionally, muselets require six half-turns to open. Muselets are now machine-made in millions. A modern development has seen the production of personalized caps within the muselet, which display the emblems or name of the manufacturer. These may vary in colour and design from year to year and between different manufacturers. This has stimulated a market for the collection of these caps. ==References * Category:Wine packaging and storage Category:Bottles Category:Packaging Category:Seals (mechanical) ","title":"Muselet"},{"id":"35871523","text":"Jarom√≠r ≈†indel (born November 30, 1959 in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia) is an ice hockey player who played for the Czechoslovak national team.

The unit is sometimes unofficially referred to as the 1st Wisconsin Sharpshooters. == Organization == At the onset of the war, the United States Department of War charged Colonel Hiram Berdan, a known marksman, with the organization of two regiments of true marksmen, with the volunteers belonging to companies of their respective states. Company G was organized and recruited in Wisconsin under the supervision of Adjutant General William L. Utley, who was also a noted marksman and was crucial to the expedited process of organizing and mustering Wisconsin volunteer regiments. Berdan had the men issued green uniforms for a better blend into the wilderness, along with a distinction from the rest of the army wearing variations of blue. He also continuously petitioned the War Department for the issue of the Sharps Breechloading Rifle, versus the usual Springfield Rifle of Army issue. On September 19, 1861 the unit moved out from Camp Randall to rendezvous with the 1st United States Sharpshooters and were officially mustered into Federal service on September 23, 1861 in New York City. As this was an act of the War Department, the 1st and 2nd United States Sharpshooters were mustered into the regular Army and were not volunteer regiments. == Service == At camp in Washington D.C., Company G along with the rest of the 1st U.S.S. practiced rigorous marksmanship drills; dignitaries and citizens alike could come watch the amazing feats the marksmen accomplished. ==See also== * List of United States Volunteer Civil War units * List of Wisconsin Civil War units * Sharpshooter == Sources == *Quiner, E.B.

It is long and wide. The gallery has been registered as a historical monument since 7 July 1974. ==History== The gallery was built in 1823 by Marchoux, President of the Chamber of Notaries, at the location of the Vanel de Serrant hotel and the Petits Peres passage. It was based on plans drawn up by the architect Francois Jean Delannoy. Inaugurated in 1826 under the name Marchoux, but soon renamed Vivienne, the gallery took advantage of its unique location. It attracted many visitors with its tailor shops, cobblers, wine shop, restaurant, Jousseaume bookstore, draper, confectioner, print-seller and so on. Located between the Palais-Royal, the Paris Bourse (stock exchange) and the Grands Boulevards, the passage enjoyed considerable success until the end of the Second Empire. But the gallery lost some of its appeal with the move of the prestigious shops to the Madeleine and the Champs-√âlys√©es, and particularly because of the Restauration Haussmann of Paris by Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann. The gallery has been the scene of interesting events. The monumental staircase of No. 13 led to the former home of Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq after his disgrace. The convict had become chief of a police squad made up of former criminals. There has historically been competition with the nearby Galerie Colbert. Since 1960 the gallery has once again become very active. It features fashion and home furnishings, and haute couture shows held there. The installation of Jean Paul Gaultier and Yuki Torii shops in 1986 helped with the resurrection of the gallery. It now houses many shops selling ready-to-wear and decorative items. ==Description== An interior view of the Galerie Vivienne Fran√ßois-Jacques Delannoy conceived the decor in neo-classical Pompeian style covered with an elegant canopy, with mosaics, paintings and sculptures exalting trade. The restoration work rehabilitated the abundant ornaments around the half-moon windows, and the goddesses and nymphs that adorn the rotunda. The mosaic floors are signed Giandomenico Facchina and Mazzioli. Their sobriety emphasized by the repetition of simple geometric shapes is reminiscent of the style of the mosaics of the Rue de Rivoli. The long gallery is sheltered by a glazed rotunda with a hemispherical glass dome that allows for air circulation. ==Gallery== Panorama of the galerie Vivienne File:Galerie Vivienne 1820.jpgGalerie Vivienne during the Restoration File:P1010886 Paris II Rue Vivienne Galerie Vivienne reductwk.JPGEntrance on the rue Vivienne File:P1040479 Paris II galerie Vivienne entr√©e rwk.JPGEntrance on the rue des Petits-Champs File:Galerie Vivienne stairway.jpgStairway File:Paris - galerie Vivienne - mosa√Øque au sol.jpgMosaic of the sun File:Paris Galerie Vivienne115.JPGThe signature in mosaic of Giandomenico Facchina File:P1040477 Paris II galerie Vivienne coupole rwk.JPGRotunda and cupola File:P1040476 Paris II galerie Vivienne d√©tail rwk.JPGArchitectural details File:Galerie Vivienne decors 2183.jpgDecor details ==Location== The gallery has entrances from the rue des Petits-Champs, rue de la Banque and rue Vivienne. ==References * Category:Tourist attractions in Paris Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1823 Category:Buildings and structures in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris Category:Covered passages of Paris ","title":"Galerie Vivienne"},{"id":"35871590","text":"Mats Gunnar Hessel (born 13 March 1961) is an ice hockey player who played for the Swedish national team.

Johannes was the son of Johannes Ensched√© (1708-1780) and the brother of Jacobus and Abraham. He married Johanna Elisabeth Swaving and was the father of Johannes Ensched√© III and Christiaan Justus (the father of Adriaan Justus Ensched√©). His father was a collector of Costeriana and had statues of Coster and Hadrianus Junius, Coster's biographer, placed in the garden of his home, adjacent to the typesetter's workshop in 1768. An engraving by Cornelis van Noorde shows the workshop and the statues. Ensched√© Jr. continued his father's collection of Costeriana and also added his love of Greek and Latin books. He died relatively young, and his wife succeeded him in his role leading the company. Under her influence the day-to-day operations were split into three divisions; the newspaper, the type foundry, and the bible publishing. This \\"triumvirate\\" lasted three generations. ==References== * Enschede aan het Klokhuisplein, (Dutch), by Just Enschede, De Vrieseborch, Haarlem, 1991, Category:Members of Teylers Tweede Genootschap Category:1750 births Category:1799 deaths Category:People from Haarlem Category:18th-century Dutch businesspeople Category:Joh.

Along with the communities of Brackla and Bridgend, it makes up the town of Bridgend. Coychurch Lower is the eastern district of Bridgend, and takes in the village of Coychurch and the area known as Waterton. Traffic leaving the M4 Motorway for Bridgend at Junction 35 travels through Coychurch Lower along the A473 road, passing through an area of business parks and out-of town shopping zones, which takes up the majority of the western half of the community. The population of Coychurch Lower at the 2001 census was 1206, increasing to 1,365 at the 2011 census. The community of Coychurch Lower was created in 1974 when the civil parishes of Wales were abolished. In 1996, in a major change to the boundaries of Bridgend, Coychurch Lower gained much of the community of Ewenny and Llangan. ==Buildings of note== Coychurch Lower has several buildings of note. In the village of Coychurch is the church of St. Crallo, one of the largest churches in Glamorgan. Thought to be built on the site of a Celtic clas, St Crallo is a 13th-century cruciform church, described by English historian Edward Augustus Freeman as making \\"an admiral model for a small colonial cathedral\\". The church has undergone several restorations, including interior work in 1871 by John Prichard and a reconstruction of the south transept in 1888 by F.R. Kempson. St Crallo's also contains several monuments, including a 14th-century figure of a praying monk and a memorial to Welsh lexicographer Thomas Richards. Also in Coychurch is the Mid Glamorgan Crematorium, one of the last commissions of Maxwell Fry. The building is notable for its stained glass windows, described as one of the most important recent displays in the county. Other buildings of note include the headquarters of the South Wales Police and Coed-y-Mwstwr, a 19th-century country house in the Tudor style. ==Notes *Map showing the community boundaries of Coychurch Lower Category:Bridgend Category:Communities in Bridgend County Borough ","title":"Coychurch Lower"},{"id":"35871682","text":"A Woman Who Understood is a 1920 American silent drama film, directed by William Parke, distributed by Robertson-Cole, and starring Bessie Barriscale. ==Plot== As described in a film magazine, Madge Graham (Barriscale), a sculptress who pays for her art work by conducting a tea room in Greenwich Village, New York City, saves violinist Robert Knight (Stanley) during an attempted suicide by throwing a tea cup through his window.

His theaters were well regarded in their communities, and many of them featured elegant and opulent designs which were formerly reserved for opera houses. His chain included first-rate movie houses such as the Apollo Theater (WV) theatre in Martinsburg, West Virginia, the Metropolitan, the Apollo Theater (DC), the Tivoli Theatre, the Savoy, The Stanley Theatre Baltimore Kent Boese, Lost Washington: The Savoy Theater, June 9, 2009 the Knickerbocker in Washington, DC. Crandall opened the Casino Theater at Fourth and East Capitol streets in 1907, though he soon sold it. In 1910, Crandall opened the La Grand Open Air Park, and in 1913 the Joy Theater at 437-439 9th Street. Crandall later identified this period as when he started to take the motion picture business seriously. While operating the Joy Theater, he began to dream of a larger theater downtown and a large theater in each section of the city. To fulfill his vision, he initially purchased and refurbished existing neighborhood movie houses that were generally modest in size such as the Apollo Theater on H Street NE. However, Crandall began commissioning entirely new buildings designed by Reginald W. Geare, such as the Knickerbocker (1917), the Metropolitan (1918), the York (1919), and the Lincoln (1922). The Metropolitan was located in Washington‚Äôs central business core on F Street, a short distance from the Joy Theater. The Knickerbocker, York, and Lincoln, on the other hand, were built outside the business district. Of these four theaters, only the York and Lincoln remain. ==Stanley- Crandall company== In 1925, Crandall sold 75 percent of his theater interests to the Stanley Company of Philadelphia, forming the new Stanley-Crandall Company. Crandall retained 25 percent ownership and became the executive of the company, which, at the time, was among the four largest theatrical organizations in the country. The Stanley-Crandall Company was purchased in 1927, by Warner Brothers. Harry Crandall retired from active theater operation in 1929. ==Community involvement== Crandall used his position and his theaters to educate the population, and to provide space for their cultural and civic activities. He created a Public Service and Educational Department and placed it under the direction of Harriet Hawley Locher, a prominent Washington club woman and past chairperson of the Motion Picture Committee of the District of Columbia Federated Women‚Äôs Clubs. Crandall and Locher believed that the neighborhood theater could function as a community center, and that it could provide space for educational, cultural and religious activities when not showing movies. In another move to gain the good will of neighborhood children, Crandall provided equipment for boys‚Äô baseball teams. ==Death== The Knickerbocker Theater 1917 On January 28, 1922 the Knickerbocker theater owned by Crandall collapsed under the weight of snow from a two-day blizzard that was later dubbed the Knickerbocker Storm. 98 patrons were killed and 133 more injured. The disaster ranks as one of the worst in Washington. D.C. history. Former Congressman Andrew Jackson Barchfeld and a number of prominent political and business leaders were among those killed in the theater. The disaster was said to be the reason for the later suicide of Crandall in 1937. The architect Reginald Geare had taken his own life on August 20, 1927. ==References *Historic Landmark Nomination for the York Theater 2012 Category:1879 births Category:1937 deaths Category:American theatre managers and producers Category:Businesspeople who committed suicide Category:Cinema of Washington, D.C.

It told the story of the community living at the bottom of a canyon. The Wendell family was looking for an original holiday by caravan but their trip ends sooner than expected at the bottom of a canyon in Alberta, Canada. The canyon walls are too high to climb and there is no way out. Soon they find out there is a whole community of 29 or 30 survivors from previous crashes down there. Dollars are not accepted and they use golf tees as a currency. ==Development== Crash Canyon launched on September 18, 2011. Joel Cohen, a Canadian expatriate living in Los Angeles while writing for The Simpsons, said that creating an animated Canadian show with fellow expatriates would allow to write \\"jokes only hosers would get\\". He recruited ex-Canadian writers Tim Long of The Simpsons and Chuck Tatham of How I Met Your Mother to write scripts for the series. Co-producer and story editor Greg Lawrence said that they have tried not to put too much emphasis on the family trying to escape the canyon. \\"It's not Gilligan's Island where every episode is: 'This week we're getting off the island.' But we do keep the sentiment alive, so as you move through the series there are attempts to get out and all fail.\\" In 2013, Teletoon released a press statement to Bubbleblabber saying that the network will not be moving forward with a third season of the series,\\"Unfortunately a third season of Crash Canyon is not in our plans at this time.\\" The show ended on March 3, 2013. ==CharactersWendells=== *Norman \\"Norm\\" Wendell: Head of the family. An extremely rational engineer, he never loses his temper and is arguably the sanest person in the Canyon. He has very little social skill and often tries to solve his problems with science, only to fail. *Sheila Wendell: Norm's wife. She is easily enraged but also a very loving and caring mother and wife. She openly hates Vernon, Beverly and Angel. *Roxanne \\"Roxy\\" Wendell: The Wendell's teenage daughter, she is consistently portrayed as extremely self-centered and selfish, and constantly complains about being stuck in the canyon. She does show occasional love for her family, but this is rare. *Jacob \\"Jake\\" Wendell: Wendells' son, a 10-year old scam artist obsessed with making money through scams, gambling and fraud. He respects his father more than his sister does. Is often seen alongside Sid's children Sly and Butch. *Vernon \\"Vern\\" Wendell: Norm's morbidly obese third cousin who had accompanied the family on vacation. Vernon is enormously overweight and rides around on a mobility scooter. He's also an alcoholic. Vernon is mean, ill-tempered and stupid, making him one of the least liked inhabitants of the canyon. He lives out of the family's crashed SUV. ===Butanes=== Note: The entire hillbilly family speaks grammatical false English, and writes letters in false direction. Also, everyone of them is very dimwitted, bordering mental retardation. *Sid: Former British punk rocker. His main hit was a song called \\"I Wanna Punch A Rainbow\\", which can be heard in some episodes. He obviously has a drug problem, and most of time talks about pointless things. He wears a safety pin in his nose and has two earrings on every ear. He and his family ended up in the canyon after a plane crash. *Emily: Sid's wife. She is dimwitted, like the rest of her family, but seems to be more responsible to her children than her husband. She thinks French talking men are very romantic. *Mace: The Butanes' love-sick teenage daughter. She desperately looks for a boyfriend (even going so far as to date animals or create one in her mind). She is friends with Roxy and Pristine, but only Roxy can hold the trio together. *Sly (blonde) and Butch (brown haired): Perverse younger sons of the Butanes. They have bad teeth and are extremely stupid, often endangering their lives because of it. They are friends (or rather, sidekicks) of Jake. They also seem to have an incestuous crush on their sister and each other; however, this can come from their dumbness. ===Manderbelts=== *Reginald: Owner of Manderbelt Industries, husband of Beverly and father to Royce, Pristine and Vaughn. He is a very arrogant, selfish and snobbish man who often boasts about his wealth. He and his family wanted to move with their home (literally), but ended up in the canyon. *Beverly: The snobby matron of the Manderbelts. She is as arrogant as her husband, and sometimes even more. She has a creepy crush on her son Royce, and she even bathes him. **Bjorn: The family's Norwegian servant, who never speaks (although it's never revealed why). It seems that he dates Frida sometimes. He has a very muscular build, and he does everything the Manderbelts tell him to do, irrelevant of how bad or immoral it is. According to Reginald, he has to take the Manderbelt's behaviour because he is poor. **Princess The Manderbelts' two legged, disabled cat. *Royce: The Manderbelts' son. Very handsome, he is Roxy's love interest until season 2. *Pristine: The Manderbelts' middle child and only daughter who is also a friend of Roxy. Unlike the other Manderbelts, Pristine is much less snobby and arrogant and rather kind and friendly towards the other inhabitants causing her to be regarded as ugly by the rest of her family, in spite of her nice appearance. *Vaughn: Youngest son and undefeated antagonist, he has anger issues. He does not say much aside from saying \\"I¬¥m Vaughn\\". His parents do nothing to stop his aggressive behavior nor discipline him. ===Charbonneaus=== *Angel: Mother/daughter team who tours the junior beauty pageant circuit. They, like the Manderbelts, are very arrogant, and sometimes even more. Despite the fact that Angel is manipulating and mischievous, she loves her daughter dearly and is very maternal towards her. *Brandi: Ruthless girl very spoiled unlike Roxy to care himself. **St√©phane: Gay coach for Brandi's modelling. He acts like a stereotypical arrogant French man. ===Other characters=== *Sarah Forbes: Ever optimist cheerleader. She acts as the mayor of Crash Canyon and has every time the presidency on every meeting. She is always happy and never seems to lose her nerves. She lives in a school bus. She also runs the canyons school. *Nalappat Brajabashimayum and Dummy: Indian ventriloquist and his abusive dummy. He treats his dummy like a living being. Nalappat runs the only bar in the canyon, in which a strange drink made by himself is served. It is unknown what the recipe is but, according to him, it will get you drunk. *Frida Dominguez: A Mexican lady, she runs a restaurant with the lowest hygiene standards. She has been married countless times. She is a very sexually active person and has an affair with Bjorn. *Colton Steel and Private Lippy: Astronauts who ended up in the canyon when their capsule landed there after re-entry. Colton is a very patriotic astronaut, while Lippy has a crush on Roxy. They both are the best friends. He is the only one in the canyon with American nationality. *Earl: A biker thug who ended up in the canyon after a friend from his group punched buggied him. He is very violent, but can be humorous sometimes. He has a large beard and red hair. *Hiko: Elder Japanese man, he talks like a stereotypical fast talking Asian. Most people in the canyon seem to not get that he is Japanese, as many believe him to be Chinese, Taiwanese or of other Asiatic descent, which angers him. *Mrs. Mcgurck and Bear: An abusive old lady who throws her insults and tortures at a brown bear (after she believed it ate her husband) and treats him like a slave. The bear takes it. *Pete and Carol: Ambulance attendants, most of the time they act very amoral and irresponsible for their occupation. They make many jokes. They ended up in the canyon after Pete let go of the wheel and they went off the road. *Coma Steve: Pete and Carol's patient who only lies on a stretcher. Its shown that Coma Steve is still aware of what happens around him, and occasionally comments on it, but is unable to move or speak. Before he fell into the canyon he had a perfect life (he was engaged, was about to become a father, and won 50 million dollars), but while trying to save a girl's kitten he dislocated his arm. When Pete and Carol drove him to the hospital, Pete got off of the road, falling into the canyon, causing Steve to fall into a coma. In the canyon, Pete and Carol treat him as an object. ===One-time characters=== *Russel Mcgurck: Husband to the aforementioned widow. He appears in \\"Moose on the Loose\\". It turns out that he and his wife ended up in the Canyon after he attempted to suicide because of the constant insults of his wife. When he wanted to eat some honey, he took off his clothes because they were full of it. Once he came back, the bear was chewing on his clothes. Russel took the chance to go into the woods and live there, but he is later found by Norm and Jake. After a failed moose hunt, the moose kicks him from a cliff, and they believe that he is dead; at the end of the episode, however, it turns out that he is still alive and hiding from his wife. It is unclear if he would join the other Canyonites if they ever find a way to escape. *Cannonball Harris: He never actually appears in the series, Colton mentions him in the pilot episode. When trying to shoot himself out of the Canyon, he crashed on one of the canyon's walls and died. Because of this character, the fact that Sarah lives in a school bus and the presence of more vehicles than Canyonites, it is hinted that there were far more people who fell into the canyon, but they got lost or died. *Bobby Joe: Bobby Joe was a man who had a very bad life until he met the girl of his dreams Cathy, until he caught her cheating on him with a deceased man. Bobby Joe then had sex with a diseased primate, and caught the fatal Rametse virus, he then tried committing suicide by jumping into the canyon, after coming together as a community, the Canyonites throw Bobby Joe a proper funeral after he finally succumbs to death and is raped to death by Bear. *Robin Banks: A bank robber in the 1800s, who hid in the canyon alongside his two accomplices (a monkey and a donkey). He sealed off the canyon with an impenetrable door that could only be opened with a donkey hoof and a monkeys paw. Unfortunately, Banks never made it back out of the canyon as his leg got stuck in a fire ant hill, and his other leg was eaten by a python. He left his diaries behind in case someone else ever ended up in the canyon. ==Episodes== The show consists of two seasons, with the first season consisting of 18 episodes and the second of 8. The episode order of the show as aired on Teletoon in Canada differs from that of airings in other countries. ===Season 1=== { + Crash Canyon season 1 episodes - style=\\"color: white;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: maroon;\\" Canadian # ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: maroon;\\" International # ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: maroon;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: maroon;\\" Canadian airdate } ===Season 2=== { + Crash Canyon season 2 episodes - style=\\"color: white;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: olive;\\" Canadian # ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: olive;\\" International # ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: olive;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: olive;\\" Canadian airdate } ==References * Category:2011 Canadian television series debuts Category:2013 Canadian television series endings Category:2010s Canadian adult animated television series Category:2010s Canadian animated comedy television series Category:Canadian adult animated comedy television series Category:Canadian flash animated television series Category:English- language television shows Category:Teletoon original programming Category:Television shows set in Alberta Category:Animated television series about children Category:Animated television series about families Category:Animated television series about teenagers ","title":"Crash Canyon"},{"id":"35871741","text":"Thom Lennart Eklund (born October 28, 1958) is an ice hockey player who played for the Swedish national team.

Sparkes (born 16 May 1933) is a British Classical Archaeologist and Art Historian, specialising in the art of Ancient Greece. For most of his academic career, he has been based at The University of Southampton, where he was Professor of Classical Archaeology, and helped to found the Department of Archaeology. == Early life == Sparkes was brought up in Sheffield and attended King Edward VII School from 1944 to 1952. He took a Classics degree at Kings College London and was awarded first class honours in 1955. During those years he was one of the chief instigators for performing Greek plays in the original Greek and himself played Hippolytus in the first production. The tradition started in 1953 continues to this day. == Academic career == From 1955 to 1957 he studied for a PhD (on Aristophanes and his Athenian background) that took him to Greece and gained him a School Studentship at the British School of Archaeology. In Athens he studied ceramic material in the Athenian Agora and as a consequence of this connection he was awarded a two-year studentship at The American School of Classical Studies to start in 1957. This connection led to the direction of his academic work for the next ten years. In the autumn of 1958 he was appointed as an Assistant Lecturer at Southampton University where he stayed from the rest of his career until the 1990s when he retired as a Professor of Classical Archaeology, moving in the 1980s from the Classics Department to the Department of Archaeology which he had helped to establish. He chaired various committees in the University and in the 1990s became Public Orator. During his early years in Southampton he travelled annually to Athens to continue his work in the Athenian Agora. He was awarded an Herodotus Fellowship at Princeton Institute of Advanced Study for 1962‚Äì63 to work with Miss Lucy Talcott on classical Athenian plain wares. The result of this investigation was published in 1970. In 1964 he was appointed the editor of The Journal of Hellenic Studies and Archaeological Reports, a position he held until 1971. For five years (2000‚Äì05) he was Chairman of the Managing Committee of the Primary Latin Project. Over the years he held the Geddes-Harrower Visiting Professorship in Aberdeen, the First Leventis Visiting Professorship at the University of Edinburgh, and was the President of the Joint Association of Classical Teachers and the President of the Classical Association. During his 40 years of teaching and research he gave lectures at many universities and schools in Britain and abroad: New York, Sydney, Melbourne, Christchurch, Cincinnati, Tampa, North Carolina (Duke), the Getty in Los Angeles, St Petersburg. In 2004 he was honoured with a Festschrift entitled ‚ÄòGreek Art in View‚Äô, edited by Simon Keay and Stephanie Moser. (Oxbow Books). == Field of Studies == The major thrust of his research has centred on Attic pottery, both plain, black-figure and red-figure. This has involved studying the production, shapes and distribution and the varied scenes that decorate the vases. == Personal life == Brian has been married to Diana (n√©e Foss) since 1959. They have two children, Philip and Catherine, and three grandsons. ==Selected Book Publications== * (with Lucy Talcott) Pots and Pans of Classical Athens, Princeton, 1959 * (with Lucy Talcott) Black and Plain Pottery, The Athenian Agora vol. 12, 2 vols, Princeton, 1970 * (edited with Donna C.

Major contributors to the population of orphans and otherwise homeless children included World War I (1914-1918), the October Revolution of November 1917 followed by the Russian Civil War (1917-1922), famines of 1921‚Äì1922 and of 1932‚Äì1933, political repression, forced migrations, and the Soviet-German War theatre (1941-1945) of World War II. ==Abandoned children, 1918‚Äì1930== By the early 1920s, Russia was home to millions of orphaned and abandoned children, collectively described in Russian as besprizornye, besprizorniki (literally \\"unattended\\").Alan M. Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened: Abandoned Children in Soviet Russia, 1918‚Äì1930 (London: University of California Press, 1994), xi. By 1922, World War I, Russian Revolution, and Civil War had resulted in the loss of at least 16 million lives within the Soviet Union's borders, and severed contact between millions of children and their parents. At this time, Bolshevik authorities were faced with an estimated seven million homeless youths.Orlando Figes, A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891‚Äì1924 (New York: Penguin, 1996), 780. The Russian famine of 1921 of 1921‚Äì1922 killed some 5 million people.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 9; Figes, A People's Tragedy, 775. Many children were abandoned or left home of their own accord.Vladimir Zenzinov, Deserted: The Story of the Children Abandoned in Soviet Russia (London: Herbert Joseph, 1931), 62‚Äì63. By mid-1921, starvation had become so extreme that from June 1921 to September 1922 the state evacuated 150,000 children to lessen the burden placed on institutions and clinics in affected regions. Foreign relief organizations fed nearly 4.2 million children, with the American Relief Administration handling 80% of this total. Altogether, including the state's and foreign organizations' distribution of food, close to 5 million youths received meals. Millions of others received no assistance.Ball, \\"State Children,\\" 232‚Äì233. Most besprizornye were beggars.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 60. Public response varied, and the media discouraged giving the children any money, recommending donations to charitable organizations instead. When alms grew scarce, children with more experience and energy sought money through selling small items such as flowers or cigarettes. Some were recruited by tobacconists or newspapers to sell their products.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 52‚Äì54. Besprizornye also performed tasks for pay, such as carrying luggage at the train station or holding a place in line at the theatre. Some entered restaurants in hopes of obtaining scraps. Competition for locations was fierce.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 46‚Äì47. Thousands of children, particularly girls but also many boys, turned to prostitution. Of 5,300 street girls aged 15 and younger surveyed in 1920, 88% had worked as prostitutes. This means of support was more common in the winter, when begging outdoors was more difficult.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 56‚Äì57. The existence of millions of homeless youths led to widespread juvenile delinquency throughout Russia. When street children looked beyond begging and petty trade, they turned to stealing.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 60. Juvenile crime rose rapidly during World War I with its growth rate increasing during the famine of 1921‚Äì1922. Minors arrested by the Russian police stood at 6% of all people apprehended in 1920, and reached 10% by the first quarter of 1922.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 61‚Äì62. More than other factor, hunger prompted waifs to steal. Abandoned children arriving from the countryside were often slower to embrace thievery than those from urban backgrounds, but in general, the longer a child was left astray, the more likely he or she was to succumb to crime.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 63. Gangs would operate in groups as large as thirty to assure successful pickpocketing and other forms of robbery.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 71. Tobacco, drug, and alcohol addictions were common, and the first half of the 1920s saw the influx of a larger supply of cocaine as well as the development of a more extensive network of drug dealers. Urchins lived and worked in the midst of this network and drug expenses spurred on juveniles' thefts.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 76. The street introduced large percentages of its inhabitants to early sexual activity. Waifs generally began their sex lives by the age of fourteen, many girls as early as seven. Many contracted sexually transmitted diseases, and rape was common.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 78. Crime, drugs, sex, and the harsh nature of life on the street had a lasting impact. Besprizornye developed qualities considered undesirable by the rest of society, and had a range of mental and physical health issues.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 80‚Äì83. Following the October Revolution the new Bolshevik government proposed that the state should take on the task of raising not just orphans but all the nation's children.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened 87. Communist pedagogy aimed to create a \\"vast communistic movement among minors.\\"Zenzinov, Deserted, 32. Narkompros (People's Commissariat of Education) was tasked with providing for homeless children and managing orphanages. Children were provided with necessities, received education (including in communist doctrine), and were expected to help with chores and decision making. The orphanages were inaugurated in a spirit of revolutionary idealism, but were soon overwhelmed by the need to feed and house millions of homeless children.Ball, \\"State Children,\\" 230‚Äì231. By the mid-1920s, the Soviet state was forced to realize that its resources for orphanages were inadequate, that it lacked the capacity to raise and educate the USSR's stray children. The Soviet government now initiated new policies. The state reached out to society for assistance. Foster care by private families was promoted as a partial solution.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 149. Night shelters were used in some locations.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 150. During the second half of the 1920s, the conditions of orphanages improved significantly, but deficiencies remained. The Soviet state succeeded in saving stray children, but its mission of socialist upbringing stagnated.Ball, And Now My Soul Is Hardened, 174. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War Anton Makarenko established self- supporting orphanages for street children. ==Children of \\"enemies of the people\\", 1937‚Äì1945== The mid-1930s witnessed the peak of persecution of perceived political enemies, with millions of Soviet citizens imprisoned and hundreds of thousands executed.John A. Getty, Gabor T. Rittersporn, and Viktor N. Zemskov, \\"Victims of the Soviet Penal System in the Pre-War Years: A First Approach on the Basis of Archival Evidence,\\" The American Historical Review 98 (1993): 1017. Up until 1937, there were no specific guidelines on how to treat the children of these \\"enemies of the people\\". Yet after the Great Purge there were \\"...at least several hundred thousand children [who] lost their parents\\". Now the government was forced to confront the problem of managing this new category of orphans.Corinna Kuhr, \\"Children of 'Enemies of the People' as Victims of the Great Purges,\\" Cahiers Du Monde Russe 39 (1998): 210. In 1937, the Politburo decided to accommodate children of the enemies of the people in normal orphanages administered by the Narkompros. Educational staff underwent training by the NKVD (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs), and the orphans' names were kept on record.Kuhr, \\"Victims of the Great Purges,\\" 211-12. This reflects the Communist Party's theory of socially inherited criminality, often informally described by the traditional Russian proverb, \\"an apple never falls far from the tree\\". Orphanages existed not only to provide welfare, but also to prevent counter-revolutionary ideas from contaminating society.Catriona Kelly, Children's World: Growing Up in Russia, 1890‚Äì1991 (New Haven: Yale UP, 2007), 238. There were no official orders to discriminate against children of enemies of the people.Kuhr, \\"Victims of the Great Purges,\\" 216. Yet orphanage staff often beat, underfed, and abused such pupils.Kelly, Children's World, 238. Any misbehavior was understood as the product of a counter-revolutionary upbringing, and punished harshly.Kelly, Children's World, 328. Treating children like budding criminals had diverse effects. In some cases, the induced \\"class guilt\\" inspired orphans to prove their loyalty to the ideals of Communism. In other cases abusive treatment was to incite resentment toward the state.Kuhr, \\"Victims of the Great Purges,\\" 209-15. If judged to be \\"socially dangerous,\\" the NKVD sent orphans to either a colony for young delinquents or a Gulag labor camp.Kuhr, \\"Victims of the Great Purges,\\" 211. The tendency was to place all difficult orphans in colonies, which sought to re-educate children using a labor regime.Kelly, Children's World, 233. Children over fifteen were liable for at least five years in camp for being a \\"family member of a traitor to the motherland\\".Kelly, Children's World, 237. ==War orphans, 1945‚Äì1953== With World War II came a new wave of orphans. After 1945, the NKVD was responsible for accommodating 2.5 million homeless children.M. R. Zezina, \\"The System of Social Protection for Orphaned Children in the USSR,\\" Russian Social Science Review 42.3 (2001): 49‚Äì51. However, the war softened attitudes towards bereaved children, a shift which eventually led to the improvement of the welfare system. The public regarded war orphans as innocent victims rather than subversives, and many citizens dedicated themselves to providing relief. There was a reversal of the previous era's stigma; adults caught in occupied zones did not pass their criminality on to their children. The state nurtured these children alongside other war orphans.Kelly, Children's World, 243-46. Orphanages now focused on making children feel at home. Special orphanages were built exclusively for children of officers and soldiers.Laurie Bernstein, \\"Communist Custodial Contests: Adoption Rulings in the USSR after the Second World War,\\" Journal of Social History 34 (2001): 843‚Äì61. Soviet trade unions and the Komsomol supported these homes with additional funding.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 53. In 1944, the government placed legal protection on the property of orphans.Kelly, Children's World, 243-44 Developments like these reflect the leverage of children orphaned by war. In the words of one girl, \\"We used to dwell on our rights‚Ä¶ we're not to be blamed for having lost everything in the war!\\"Marina Balina and Evgeny A. Dobrenko, Petrified Utopia: Happiness Soviet Style (London: Anthem, 2009), 13. In 1949, the Council of Ministers of USSR created the decree \\"On Measures to Further Improve the Operation of Children's Homes\\" to provide the appropriate funds to orphanages.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 54. Wartime shortages meant that most orphanages were still undersupplied, but children fostered a sense of patriotic sacrifice as opposed to resentment towards the state.Kelly, Children's World, 247-50. Adoption as well as long-term fostering and short- term fostering became popular during the war. From 1941‚Äì1945, 200,000 children were adopted in the Soviet Union.Bernstein, \\"Communist Custodial Contests,\\" 844. 'Model workers' featured in propaganda were often adoptive parents.Kelly, Children's World, 243. Courts preferred to place children with families, taking into account the importance of love, security, and happiness in childhood.Bernstein, \\"Communist Custodial Contests,\\" 845. The population of homeless children declined in the years after the war, largely due to the public's participation in the foster care system.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 56. German children in Kaliningrad region annexed in 1945 didn't obtain state help during some period; some of them survived in Lithuania. ==Orphans after Stalin, 1953‚Äì1991== The government's approach to child homelessness continued to advance in the decades following Stalin's death. During the 1960s‚Äì1980s, rising prosperity reduced the orphan population, easing the problem of overcrowding.Kelly, Children's World, 267. Most 'orphans' actually had parents, but left their families due to abuse or lack of security.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 56‚Äì57. These factors contributed to the shift from orphanages to boarding schools beginning in the mid-1950s. The Communist Party lauded such schools for combining education with labor regimes to produce hardworking Soviet citizens.Kelly, Children's World, 260. In the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Khrushchev called boarding schools \\"schools of the future\\". He launched a long-term campaign in 1959 to expand the boarding network.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 57. Many orphanages were converted into schools, while the remainder became more exclusively refuges for handicapped children. A positive effect of integrating homeless children with other school children was the further de-stigmatization of orphans.Kelly, Children's World, 262-67. This period experienced a continuation of the previous era's endorsement of foster care and adoption. Perestroika and glasnost ended press censorship, exposing the decrepit state of orphanages to the public.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 61. Journalists contrasted the spiritual warmth of family life to cold institutions. This, in conjunction with Gorbachev's partial marketization in 1987, spurred the creation of private children's charities. Adoption was now the favored solution to child homelessness, providing children with permanent and stable homes.Kelly, Children's World, 269-70. During the second half of the 20th century, there was a shift in Soviet law enforcement, from pure punitive and \\"resocialization\\" approach to crime prevention, which also targeted social orphanhood. Decrees such as the 1981 \\"On Measures to Strengthen State Assistance to Families with Children\\" reflect these changes.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 60. Parents became increasingly responsible for their children's misdeeds. In the late eighties, a young offender was commonly characterized as \\"an adolescent deprived of family warmth\\".Kelly, Children's World, 277. The number of children sent to penal colonies decreased in favor of re-education programs. Special boarding schools were created for juvenile offenders.Kelly, Children's World, 272-74. As the Soviet Union moved toward its collapse, the orphan population began to rise once more. In 1988, 48,000 children were classified as homeless; in 1991, this number climbed to 59,000. The economic downturn, ethnic conflicts, and food shortages contributed to these statistics.Zezina, \\"System of Social Protection,\\" 62. Poverty defined the plight of family life in the years to come.Fiona Werge, \\"Child Poverty Soars in Eastern Europe,\\" BBC News (2000) ==See also== *Orphans in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:Child welfare Category:Soviet society Category:Orphanages in Russia ru:–î–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –±–µ—Å–ø—Ä–∏–∑–æ—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∏ –±–µ–∑–Ω–∞–¥–∑–æ—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤ –°–°–°–† ","title":"Orphans in the Soviet Union"},{"id":"35871844","text":"Alex Sexton (born 3 December 1993) is a professional Australian rules footballer who plays for the Gold Coast Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL) ==Early life== Sexton grew up in Logan, Queensland where he attended Chisholm Catholic College.

It corresponds roughly to the modern Khatlon Province of Tajikistan. The pre-Islamic Principality of Khuttal played an active role, sometimes as an ally, sometimes as an enemy, of the Umayyads during the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana, and it was not until 750/1 that the Abbasids finally established direct control over it. A branch of the Banijurids of Tokharistan ruled over the area under the Abbasids, and acknowledged the suzerainty of the Samanids in the 10th century. The area apparently retained an autonomous line of rulers in the 11th‚Äì12th centuries, when it came first under the loose control of the Ghaznavids, and after the middle of the 11th century of the Seljuq Empire. With the decline of Seljuq power, Khuttal passed to the control of the Ghurids and the Khwarazmshahs, under whom no native princely line is known. In the 13th century Khuttal became a part of the Mongol Empire and of its successor, the Chagatai Khanate, emerging once again as an autonomous principality following the latter's disintegration in the mid-14th century.

The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of climate, altitude, rainfall and soil conditions supports a variety of distinct plant and animal species, such as the Nepal gray langur (Semnopithecus schistaceus) ==Lowland forests== On the Indo-Gangetic plain at the base of the mountains, an alluvial plain drained by the Indus and Ganges- Brahmaputra river systems, vegetation varies from west to east with rainfall. The xeric Northwestern thorn scrub forests occupy the plains of Pakistani and the Indian Punjab. Further east lie the Upper Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and the Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests of Bihar and West Bengal. These are monsoon forests, with drought-deciduous trees that lose their leaves during the dry season. The moister Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests occupy the plains of Assam. ==The Terai belt== Indian rhinoceros in the Terai Above the alluvial plain lies the Terai strip, a seasonally marshy zone of sand and clay soils. The Terai has higher rainfall than the plains, and the downward-rushing rivers of the Himalaya slow down and spread out in the flatter Terai zone, depositing fertile silt during the monsoon season and receding in the dry season. The Terai has a high water table due to groundwater percolating down from the adjacent zone. The central part of the Terai belt is occupied by the Terai- Duar savanna and grasslands, a mosaic of grasslands, savannas, deciduous and evergreen forests that includes some of the world's tallest grasslands.Dinerstein, E., Loucks, C. (2001). The grasslands of the Terai belt are home to the Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). ==Bhabhar belt== Above the Terai belt is an upland zone known as the Bhabhar, a zone of porous and rocky soils made up of debris washed down from the higher ranges. The belt lies at the foot of the Himalayas where the Himalayan streams descend on to the plains. The Bhabhar and the lower Shiwalik ranges have a subtropical climate. The Himalayan subtropical pine forests occupy the western end of the subtropical belt, with forests dominated by Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii). The central part of the range is home to the Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests, an ecoregion that has many different kinds of forest. One kind of forest is dominated by the sal tree (Shorea robusta). ==Shiwalik Hills== Also called Churia or Margalla Hills, Sivalik Hills is an intermittent outermost range of foothills extending across the Himalayan region through Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan. This region consists of many sub-ranges. Summits are generally . Steeper southern slopes form along a fault zone called Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT); northern slopes are gentler. Permeable conglomerates and other rocks allow rainwater to percolate downslope into the Bhabhar and Terai, supporting only scrubby forests upslope. The Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests continue here. ==Inner Terai or Dun Valleys== The Inner Terai valleys are open valleys north of Shiwalik Hills or nestled between Shiwalik subranges. Examples include Dehra Dun in India and Chitwan in Nepal. Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests grow here. ==Lesser Himalaya== Himalayas from Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Also called the Mahabharat Range, the Lesser Himalayas is a prominent range high formed along the Main Boundary Thrust fault zone, with a steep southern face and gentler northern slopes. The range is nearly continuous except for river gorges, where groups of rivers from the north gather like candelabra in a handful of places to break through the range. At these elevations and above, the biogeography of the Himalayas is generally divided by the Kali Gandaki Gorge in central Nepal, one of the deepest canyons in the world. At the middle elevations of the range, the subtropical forests yield to a belt of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests growing between , with the western Himalayan broadleaf forests to the west of the Gandaki River, and the eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests to the east. The western broadleaf forests stretch from the Kashmir Valley, across Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and through western Nepal. The eastern broadleaf forests stretch across eastern Nepal, through Sikkim and Bhutan, and through much of Arunachal Pradesh. ==Midlands== This 'hilly' region (Pahad), averaging about immediately north of the Mahabharat Range, rises to about over a distance of at the Main Central Thrust fault zone, where the Greater Himalaya begin. Subalpine forest at Cher-tang La, Bhutan Above the broadleaf forests, between , are temperate coniferous forests, likewise split by the Gandaki River. The western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests are found below treeline in northern Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and western Nepal. The eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests are found in eastern Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, and Arunachal Pradesh. Along the border between Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet, the eastern subalpine conifer forests mix with the northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests. East Himalayan Fir, West Himalayan Spruce, and Himalayan Hemlock are some important trees of these forests. Rhododendrons are exceptionally diverse here, with over 60 species recorded in the northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests. ==Greater Himalaya== North of the Main Central Thrust, the highest ranges rise abruptly as much as into the realm of perpetual snow and ice. As the Himalayan system becomes wider from east to west, the number of parallel high ranges increases. For example, the Kagmara and Kanjiroba ranges both reach well over north of the Dhaulagiri Himalaya in central Nepal. Valley of the Flowers Alpine tundra lies above treeline. The areas above natural treeline is chiefly composed of annuals, which is differentiated into alpine grasslands and meadows. The steep slopes are mainly predominated by grasses whereas the meadows are dominated by herbaceous species. The northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows are found in the high elevations of northern Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh. To the east, the western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows cover extensive areas along the Tibetan border with Uttarakhand and western Nepal. The eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows grow above the eastern and northeastern subalpine conifer forests, along the Tibetan border with eastern Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, and Arunachal Pradesh. The shrublands are composed of junipers as well as a wide variety of rhododendrons. They also possess a remarkable variety of wildflowers: Valley of Flowers National Park in the western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows contains over 520 species of plants, of these 498 are flowering plants. The upper limit of the grasslands increases from west to east, rising from to . The grasslands are the summer habitat of the endangered snow leopard (Panthera uncia). ==Trans-Himalaya== The watershed between rivers flowing south into the Ganges or Indus and rivers flowing north into the Brahmaputra or mainstem Indus that flow around the ends of the entire range often follows somewhat lower, less rugged mountains tens of kilometers north of the highest ranges. South-flowing rivers form valleys in this region, often semi-arid due to rainshadow effects. These valleys hold some of the highest permanent villages on earth on the slopes. ==References== ","title":"Ecology of the Himalayas"},{"id":"35872163","text":"SM U-36 was the number given to two German U-boats and , when operating under the flag of Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean Sea during World War I.

He is a sugar cane farmer and businessman from Jeanerette, Louisiana and is a Republican member of the Louisiana State Senate from District 21, which encompasses all of St. Mary and portions of Iberia, Lafourche, and Terrebonne parishes. Allain graduated in 1980 with a degree in agricultural engineering from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He was elected outright in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 2011 for the right to succeed the term- limited Democratic Senator Butch Gautreaux of Morgan City. Allain received 14,618 votes (51.4 percent) in the contest with another Republican, Darrin Guidry, a newspaper publisher from Houma, who polled 13,846 votes (48.6 percent). No Democrat sought Gautreaux's seat in the revised district. Allain lists flood protection at the top his legislative priorities: \\"It's important we protect people from hurricanes and back-water flooding. One project that proved itself during the Mississippi River flooding is the sinking of the barge in Bayou Chene. That probably saved hundreds of homes in Terrebonne and St. Mary parishes. I also want to move the Morganza-to-the-Gulf levee system along.\\"\\"We will continue to fight for as much money as we can for funding for levees and the Bayou Chene project.\\" Allain said. Allain is committed to completing Interstate 49, the Shreveport to Lafayette superhighway.

He was the founder and chairman of the business conglomerate Jamuna Group. He died on 13 July 2020 after being hospitalized in Dhaka for a few days. == Early life == Nurul was born in Nawabganj, Dhaka to Amjad Hossen and Jomila Khatun in a Bengali Muslim family. == Career == Best known for the Jamuna Group and Jamuna Future Park, Babul was also the owner of the Bangla daily Jugantor. He founded the group in 1970s. ==Personal life== Babul was married to Salma Islam, ‚Äça member of the Jatiya Sangsad from the Jatiya Party. He had 4 children with her: Shamim Islam, Soniya Islam, Monika Islam and Rozalin Islam. In June 2020, Babul tested positive for the coronavirus amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Subsequently, he was admitted to the Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. === Controversy ===  Murder case allegations  Babul was arrested in 2004 in connection with the murder of a dredger worker, Alam Pramanik, who was working on a real estate project in Badda in 2003. Around 100 law enforcement officers from various security agencies of Bangladesh raided Babul's house in Gulshan, Dhaka shortly after midnight in March 2004. The raid was monitored by the then Home Minister Lutfozzaman Babar and had permission from the Prime Minister's Office. He was denied bail by the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. A case was filed by the owner of the dredger who claimed that 12 of Babul's men forcefully entered the dredger where his workers (including Pramanik) were sleeping and opened fire. An injured Pramanik was taken to a hospital where he later died. Babul's defence lawyers claimed that these allegations were a part of a conspiracy that was hatched by people who were jealous of Babul's success and wanted to ruin his image.  Death threats  In April 2003, Babul was arrested by Bangladesh Police for making a death threat against the then chairman of the Board of Investment and founder of the Amar Desh newspaper Mahmudur Rahman. He was later released on bail. In the same case he was also accused of land grabbing charges in Savar. Prior to this incident, the former Bangladeshi State Minister of Home Affairs Lutfozzaman Babar filed a case against Babul where he accused Babul of threatening to kill him.  Illegal property possession  Babul was once again arrested in 2007 on charges of corruption, illegal property possession, and anti-state activities. He was accused of running his real estate company on public and private land which was occupied. His defense lawyers once again protested his innocence by claiming that all the accusations were made as a part of a conspiracy to malign him.  Tax evasion  In May 2013, Babul along with his wife Salma Islam and son Shamim Islam were sued by the National Board of Revenue for tax evasion and providing false information about their income. The 3 accused were charged for dodging over Tk. 45 crore in income tax and not submitting wealth statements of Tk. 155 crore in their tax returns. The NBR also filed cases against 7 companies of Jamuna Group.  2013 arrest attempt  In 2013, the police attempted to arrest Babul from the residence of former Bangladeshi President H M Ershad. ==Death== Babul died on 13 July 2020 aged 74 from Covid-19 complications at the Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. https://tbsnews.net/bangladesh/nurul-islam- babul-be-buried-banani-graveyard-today-106033 ==References== Category:1946 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Dhaka District Category:Bangladeshi businesspeople Category:Bangladeshi chairmen of corporations Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh Category:Burials at Banani Graveyard ","title":"Nurul Islam Babul"},{"id":"35872379","text":"This is a list of listed buildings in the parish of Legerwood in the Scottish Borders, Scotland. == List == } == Key NotesReferences== * All entries, addresses and coordinates are based on data from Historic Scotland.

The post of CEA was lying vacant for over a year since Raghuram Rajan left the finance ministry to join the RBI as governor in September 2013. He then took to the Office of Chief Economic Adviser to The Government of India on 16 October 2014. He was in office till 20 June 2018. He was succeeded by Krishnamurthy Subramanian (who is the incumbent CEA to Indian Government). He served as the Dennis Weatherstone Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development, both located in Washington DC. Formerly an economist at the International Monetary Fund, he is a widely cited expert on the economics of India, China, and the changing balance of global economic power. Arvind Subramanian is the author of two books, India's Turn: Understanding the Economic Transformation published in 2008, Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China's Economic Dominance published in September 2011, and co-author of Who Needs to Open the Capital Account? which was published in 2012. In 2011, Foreign Policy magazine named him one of the world's top 100 global thinkers. == Education == Subramanian attended the DAV Boy's Senior Secondary School Chennai, for his high school education. He proceeded to St Stephen's College, Delhi for his graduation, where he obtained B.A(Hons.) Economics.

On 20 June 2018, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced that owing to family commitments, Subramanian would be stepping down before the scheduled end of his tenure to return to academia in the US. Jaitley noted that Subramanian's early diagnosis of the twin balance-sheet led to the government outlining higher public investment in the union budget of 2015‚Äì16. He also credited Subramanian with conceptualizing the Jan Dhan- Aadhaar-Mobile trinity, or JAM, as a data base of citizens for availing public benefits. In his role as the CEA, Subramanian was responsible for bringing out the annual Economic Survey of India, traditionally released prior to the presentation of the union budget in the Indian parliament. He is widely credited with revamping the presentation of information through the surveys, making them wider in scope and accessible to a larger audience. He is currently working as an economics professor at Ashoka University. == Publications == Subramanian has authored essays and other publications on growth, trade, development, institutions, aid, oil, India, Africa, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

He had been manumitted upon his birth, following a rule that said no son of a Spaniard could be born a slave, but was raised by his mother's family. There is no record of him receiving any artistic training, so he was probably self-taught. He married in 1828 and made his living by painting signs, making posters for bullfights and molding statues for nativity scenes. He also painted wall murals, all of which have been destroyed or covered over. Today, he is remembered for his watercolors, painted on sign cards, depicting everyday scenes from Peruvian life. He created over 1200 of them and their popularity produced many imitators. The writer Ricardo Palma owned a large collection which his heirs gave to the City of Lima. They are now on display at the Pinacoteca Municipal Ignacio Merino. The captions were provided by Palma, as Fierro may have been illiterate. Other large collections were acquired by the French painter L√©once Angrand and the Russian ethnographer Leopold von Schrenck, whose collection is now at the \\"Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography\\" in the Kunstkamera, Saint Petersburg. According to an obituary in El Comercio, he died of paralysis in a hospital on Peruvian Independence Day. ==Selected watercolors== File:Montoneroperuano.JPGPeruvian Montonera File:Marinera-panchofierro.jpgDancing the Marinera File:El que trae aguardiente de Yca. 1820).jpgCarrying Aguardiente from Ica File:Pulperia (1820).jpgPulperia File:Son de los diablos.jpg\\"Son de los Diablos\\" File:Going to church - Pancho Fierro.jpgGoing to Church File:Francisco Fierro - Lady bathing at Chorrillos - Google Art Project.jpgLady bathing at Chorrillos == Further reading == * * Gustavo Le√≥n y Le√≥n Dur√°n: Apuntes hist√≥rico geneal√≥gicos de Francisco Fierro: Pancho Fierro.

Chris Gebhardt, NASA Spaceflight. 30 March 2012. ==Overview== Since 2012, numerous iterations of large lunar and Mars transport habitats have been conceived in previous studies to be launched with the upcoming Space Launch System (SLS),Research Possibilities beyond Deep Space Gateway. Deep Space Gateway Science Workshop 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2063) D. V. Smitherman, D. H. Needham, and R. Lewis. NASA.Deep Space Habitat Configurations (Based on International Space Station Systems) , AES Habitation Project, March 2012. and are intended to also be compatible with the Orion capsule. Variations of the designs would be used for the Lunar Gateway and the Deep Space Transport. Early preliminary concepts considered 60-day and 500-day mission configurations, composed of International Space Station-derived hardware, the Orion crew capsule and various support craft. The habitat would be equipped with at least one International Docking System Standard (IDSS) docking system. Developing a deep space habitat would allow a crew to live and work safely in space for about one year on missions to explore cislunar space, Mars, and some near-Earth asteroids. In 2015 NASA funded studies for several types of deep space habitat concepts under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP). Lockheed Martin, the main contractor of the Orion capsule, has also produced in 2018 a Deep Space Habitat concept. These concept studies will help NASA decide on a final design for the habitat element for the Lunar Gateway with a contract potentially to be awarded in fiscal year 2019.Some snark (and details!) about NASA's proposed lunar space station.

Matt Williams, Universe Today. 21 August 2018. * 60 Day Mission - The basic 60-day mission variant would consist of a Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (CPS), ISS Destiny-derived lab module, and an airlock/tunnel. In addition, a mission-specific support craft, such as the FlexCraft or the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) would be docked to the airlock/tunnel. The Destiny-derived lab houses both the crew quarters and the ECLSS components. * 500 Day Mission - The 500 Day mission variant would consist of the same 60-day crew habitat and crew size. Mass increases would result from the addition of a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) to provide additional supply storage for the extended mission duration. It would be 8 m long and 4.5 m in diameter. ===MPLM/Node 1=== * 60 Day Mission - The basic vehicle elements for this configuration would include a CPS, a MPLM, Utility tunnel/airlock, Node 4 Structural Test Article. The Node element would allow for the attachment of more than one FlexCraft or Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV). The Habitat would be crew serviceable at the front of the Node element opposite the tunnel. *500 Day Mission - This 500-day mission variant would have a second MPLM attached to the front on the vehicle as well as add a Cupola to the Node section. ==Suggested support craft== MMSEV * Orion, is being developed by NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Airbus Defence and Space for crewed deep space travel. It is capable of carrying 4 crew, and able to withstand re-entry speeds from lunar or Martian trajectories. * MMSEV - a NASA-designed servicing craft.

Unlike later Norman monasteries, which were made up of a main religious building supported by several smaller buildings, such as cloisters and kitchens, a clas was normally a single building. The building was run by a community of clergy and headed by an abod. Clasau were autonomous and were administered locally. Following the Norman invasion of Wales in the late 11th century, many of the clasau of South Wales became dependencies of religious houses in England. This resulted in several sites becoming part of the Benedictine or Augustinian orders, or built upon in the following centuries by Norman churches. ==Clas locations in Wales== A map of clas that can be recognised from Welsh documentary sources was provided by William Rees in 1951.Rees, W.(1951),An Historical Atlas of Wales: from Early to Modern Times Faber, London, 2nd ed. 1966, Pl. 27, pg.24 Wendy Davies in her study of the Llandaff Charters, has identified 36 monasteries or ‚Äò‚Äòclasau‚Äô‚Äô from the 7th to 9th centuries mainly in the Diocese of Llandaff, and a further 38 ‚Äò‚Äòecclesiae‚Äô‚Äô or churches, some of which would be monastic. Davies suggests that this is likely to represent about 50 ‚Äò‚Äòclasau‚Äô‚Äô in total.‚ÄùDavies‚Äù, (1982), 143-144, Fig. 50 with list This would suggest that if all the Welsh Dioceses were similar and clasau which lie outside the modern boundary of Wales in the Welsh Marches a total of 150-200 clasau may have existed.‚ÄùDavies‚Äù, (1982), Fig.49, for the ‚Äò‚Äòwell evidenced religious foundations of early Wales‚Äô‚Äô Many of these early ‚Äò‚Äòclasau‚Äô‚Äô were granted as endowments to the Monasteries, particularly those of the Cistercians, founded by the Normans and the Welsh Princes. ===Listing of Documented and Probable Clas sites in Wales and the Welsh Marches.=== *Aberdaron *Abergele, now the location of St Michael's church *Bangor, St. Deiniol's clas, now Bangor Cathedral. *Bangor-on-Dee *Beddgelert, became an Augustinian monastery *St Beuno's Church, Berriew, Montgomeryshire. Founded by St Beuno a Celtic saint who died c. 640 AD. A life of the saint survivesWade Evans A W (1930), Beuno Sant Archaeologia Cambrensis, 315-322 which recounts that he was born locally in the vicinity of the river Severn and sent to study under St Tangusius or Tatheus at the Roman settlement of Caerwent near Newport. He was then given land in Aberhiew (Berriew) by Mawn ap Brochwel a descendant of Brochwel Ysgithrog, on which he would have founded this clas. He performed many miracles and founded other churches in Powys and North East Wales, before moving to Clynnog Fawr in Caernarfonshire, where he founded the monastery at Clynnog Fawr for which he is mainly remembered.‚ÄúBartrum‚Äù PC (1993) pp42-44 The church stands in an almost circular graveyard and the church was appropriated by the Cistercian Abbey of Strata Marcella in the Medieval period.Williams D.H.

The church was reputedly founded by St Beuno in the 6th Century and its almost oval churchyard may indicate that it was a monastic or clas church of early medieval origin. With the rectory and vicarage it was recorded as Eccli'a de Bethus in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 and as Ecclesia de Bethys with a value of ¬£5 in the Lincoln Taxation of 1291. Between 1254 and 1272 it became one of the appropriated churches of the Cistercian abbey of Strata Marcella, and remained so up to the Dissolution.Williams D.H.
