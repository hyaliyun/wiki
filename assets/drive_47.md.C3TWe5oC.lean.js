Ofcom had found that Vodafone had significant market power in their networks for mobile call termination (a caller on one network is connected to a mobile recipient on another network). It capped Vodafone‚Äôs charges for wholesale service of mobile call termination for four years, reducing average charges gradually. BT appealed to the CAT, arguing the price controls were set too high. The CAT referred to the Competition Commission. The Tribunal found before that under the Communications Act 2003 section 195 it could direct Ofcom to reset price controls for a four year period. It was argued that the CAT had no such power when a period had already elapsed. ==Judgment== Lloyd LJ, Moore-Bick LJ and Richards LJ held the Competition Appeal Tribunal had no power to direct Ofcom to impose revised price controls on a retrospective basis. Under CA 2003 section 195(5) it was clear there was no power to direct Ofcom to do something it would otherwise have no power to do.

With the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan, Solano started combining music and political activism, organizing a multimedia protest against war. She learned turntablism from a friend who worked at Siren Records in the Doylestown area north of Philadelphia, and by watching videos of deejay competitions. ==College== Solano chose to form her own music activism major at Emerson College in Boston, combining music production, marketing and politics. In December 2002 at age 17 she began deejaying at Boston's WERS 88.9 FM radio station, then in 2005‚Äì2006 she served as the station's program director, creating a late night show called \\"The Secret Spot\\" in which she took calls, gave advice on love, and played soul/R&B; slow jams. The show is the origin of her stage name Jasmine Solano, and it earned her the \\"Best Female Radio Personality\\" at the New England Urban Music Awards in 2006. During her college years, Solano participated in the Semester at Sea program, taking the opportunity to connect with the underground music scene of ten different countries. ==Career== In 2009, Solano opened Rock the Bells with her DJ set.

It is part of the broader International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics and has groups in the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, India, Bangladesh, the US and many more countries. The goal of the movement is to open up the discipline to different schools of thought in economics other than neoclassical economics and to other disciplines in the social sciences. Another aim is to make economics more accessible to the broader public. ==Background== In 2011, the Bank of England organized a conference ‚ÄòAre Economics Graduates Fit for Purpose?‚Äô which although widely discussed did not lead to substantive changes in the way economics is taught in many universities. Subsequently, a group of Manchester economics students who were dissatisfied with the inertia of the economics discipline after the Great Recession founded the Post-Crash Economics Society. ==Goals== The group campaigns for multiple changes in the research and teaching of economics as well as for a different connection between economics and the public. Specifically, Rethinking Economics demands more real-world applicability of the contents in economics degrees. Moreover, they want to show that economic approaches are contested instead of being akin to physics-like laws, which makes it necessary to introduce students to a variety of approaches in orthodox and heterodox economics as well as equipping them with tools to critically evaluate these approaches. The campaign's goal is therefore not to displace Neoclassical economics but instead to let other approaches join the ranks in economics curricula and research. Another aim of the group is to make economic knowledge more widely available and breaking economists' monopoly of such knowledge. ==Activities== The networks in the various countries are actively campaigning for changes in the curriculum of economics degrees. This includes lobbying with economics departments at universities, organizing public events and providing material to students and teachers in economics. The British Rethinking Economics group has to date published two books on the subject. In The Econocracy, a team of students link the dominance of neoclassical economics to an erosion of a wider democratic discussion about how the economy should be seen and organized. A second book called Rethinking Economics: An Introduction to Pluralist Economics provides an overview of different schools of thought in economics that are rarely included in introductory textbooks of economics. It includes chapters on several heterodox schools of thought written by leading academics in the field. The Dutch branch of the organization has conducted an extensive curriculum review of undergraduate economics degrees in the Netherlands. Courses were evaluated according to different criteria such as how many different methods and schools of thought are taught, how much critical thinking is fostered and the real-world relevance of the courses.http://www.rethinkingeconomics.nl/uploads/5/3/2/2/53228883/summary_powerpoint_of_curriculum_research.pdf Both the Bank of England and the Institute for New Economic Thinking have collaborated with the movement in the past. Rethinking Economics for Africa (REFA), which emerged out of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and has since expanded across South Africa, hosts an annual Rethinking Economics for Africa Festival, sponsoring students from across the continent to attend and featuring discussions and debates by prominent economists including Thandika Mkandawire, Jayati Ghosh, James Galbraith, and others. The festival is free for students, academics, and members of the public. https://www.facebook.com/REFAFestival ==Reception== The movement has received coverage by newspapers such as the Financial Times and endorsements by various public figures. Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang praised their newest book as a 'highly relevant and enlightening contribution to a debate that will shape the future of the world economy as well as the way in which economics is taught and debated'. Chief economics commentator of the Financial Times Martin Wolf wrote the foreword to the book and welcomed the initiative. ==References== == External links == * Official website Category:Schools of economic thought Category:Economics societies Category:Philosophy of economics Category:Economic methodology Category:Pluralism (philosophy) ","title":"Rethinking Economics"},{"id":"56614385","text":"The Diocese of Pontus in the 5th century.

It is ectoparasitic on the gills of the fish Pseudocrenilabrus philander. The species has been described by Laurence Dou√´llou in 1993 from fish collected in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. A complete and detailed redescription of the species, using scanning electron microscopy in addition to traditional microscopy, has been done by Igeh, Dos Santos & Avenant-Oldewage in 2017. These authors used specimens collected from the same fish species, from Padda Dam, Gauteng, South Africa. Genetic characters derived from the 28S rDNA, the COI mitochondrial DNA and ITS1 rDNA regions distinguish C. philander from all other Cichlidogyrus sequenced species. ==Morphology== Cichlidogyrus philander is characterised by a penis with a sharp, curved, lateral termination, an accessory piece with a hook-like extremity that may appear forked terminally, and lack of a visible vagina. The transverse bars of the haptor have concave and convex surfaces with ribs on the concave surface. The dorsal bar of the haptor bears fenestrations at the base of the auricles and the ventral and dorsal gripi are dissimilar. The large first pair of uncinuli shows lateral wings on the left side of the base. On top of this wing, a ball-like structure with a small fenestration is visible. ==Images of Cichlidogyrus philander in scanning electron microscopy== Parasite170078-fig3 Cichlidogyrus philander (Monogenea, Ancyrocephalidae).pngMale copulatory organ, scanning electron microscopy Parasite170078-fig4 Cichlidogyrus philander (Monogenea, Ancyrocephalidae).pngVentral and dorsal bars of the haptor, scanning electron microscopy Parasite170078-fig5 Cichlidogyrus philander (Monogenea, Ancyrocephalidae).pngGripi and uncinuli in the haptor, scanning electron microscopy ==References== ===Attribution=== This article contains content licensed under CC-BY-4.0 from https://www.parasite- journal.org/articles/parasite/abs/2017/01/parasite170078/parasite170078.html in the #Morphology section.

His name hit the headlines in 2011 when allegations surfaced that his 1983 habilitation (post-doctoral academic qualification) had been awarded for a dissertation that reportedly contained extensive word-for- word quotations from the doctoral dissertation of one or more of his own students. The potential news value of otherwise mainstream plagiarism accusations was enhanced by the fact that one of the students subsequently became Dickhuth's wife. == Life == Hans-Hermann Dickhuth was born in Braunschweig. Following qualification, in 1978 he became an assistant to Joseph Keul at the Sports Medicine Department at the University of Freiburg. He completed his specialist training in Cardiology at the university. He subsequently headed up the Echocardiography Laboratory at Freiburg where he also worked as a senior clinical physician. In 1989 he transferred to the nearby University of T√ºbingen where he took charge of the Sports Medicine department. He developed it into a highly successful centre, both clinically and scientifically. After his former boss died in 2000 he returned to Freiburg, taking over in 2001 as Chief Doctor of Sports Medicine at the University Clinic. That same year Dickhuth succeeded Keul as president of the German Society for Sports Medicine (\\"Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sportmedizin und Pr√§vention\\" / DGSP), a position he retained till 2006. He also held leadership roles during this period in the International Federation of Sports Medicine (\\"F√©d√©ration Internationale de M√©decine du Sport\\" / FIMS) and the European Federation of Sports Medicine Associations (EFSMA), serving as vice- president of the latter between 2002 and 2012. From 1981 Dickhuth was supervising top German athletes. After receiving a report on \\"Doping allegations in respect of doctors in the Sports Medicine Department\\" (\\"Dopingvorw√ºrfen gegen√ºber √Ñrzten der Abteilung Sportmedizin\\") the University Clinic eventually withdrew from providing this form of care for athletes. In the same report Dickhuth himself was cleared of any complicity or culpability in respect of doping allegations. It was, indeed, stated that following Dickhuth's appointment to the top job a number of organisational measures had been taken \\"to bring greater transparency to the individual working groups, patient reporting systems and drugs procurement processes, along with access to examination rooms and the outpatient clinics\\". == Plagiarism accusation == On 25 February 2011 the university authorities received information from Letizia Paoli, chair of the \\"Sports Medicine Evaluation Commission\\", that while conducting investigations into the \\"Freiburg doping scandal\\", they had come across doubts concerning the academic integrity (\\"Wissenschaftlichkeit\\") of several pieces of work. As the result of information passed anonymously to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung the press became aware that questions had arisen concerning the dissertation with which Dickhuth had earned his habilitation (qualification) back in 1983. The allegation was that the dissertation employed text from the doctoral dissertation of one of Dickhuth's own students. The Badische Zeitung (newspaper) reported passages (repeated without attribution) identical to some that had appeared in another doctoral dissertation that same year. This time the dissertation identified was one successfully submitted by the student who had subsequently become Dickhuth's wife. The clinic management invited those involved to state their cases before 11 March 2011: Dickmuth took some time off work, starting on 4 March 2011, but returned to his desk on 16 April 2011. The university attempted to instigate a disciplinary process, but this was revoked by the Ministry for Science because of procedural errors. It was also far from clear whether the university management enjoyed the legal competence to revoke a habilitation that had been conferred by the habilitation committee of the university clinic. Reports appeared in the media indicating that the university rectorate had at this point already spent more than half a million Euros on consulting external lawyers. The former doctoral student Marzenna Orlowska, who subsequently took a job as a pathologist at the Freiburg University clinic, was questioned by reporters. She confirmed that Dickhuth had supervised her doctorate. He had repeatedly recommended changes to her dissertation. Meanwhile, his own habilitation dissertation had been submitted. She had indeed recognised certain passages at Dickhuth's inaugural lecture, but had attached no importance to this. Independently the Habilitation Committee of the Medical Faculty convened a meeting for 28 June 2012 to discuss the matter, but the meeting was adjourned. Hans-Hermann Dickhuth has lived in retirement since 1 October 2012. An application submitted by him in 2011 to extend his contract was rejected by the faculty because they were working on a reconfiguration of the entire sports medicine department. Dickhuth therefore withdrew the application and received, in return, the opportunity to continue with his academic work at the faculty for a further year on an \\"emeritus\\" basis. On 14 October 2013 the Habilitation Committee of the Medical Faculty decided, by a narrow majority, to withdraw recognition of Dickhuth's habilitation on the basis of the alleged plagiarism. It was the first decision of this nature in the history of Freiburg University. Lawyers for Dickhuth gave notice that they would be mounting a legal challenge against the decision. On 28 May 2014 a radio report indicated that other habilitation dissertations successfully submitted at Freiburg University also included extensive textual congruences with doctoral works by others. Some of these habilitation dissertations came from professors who had themselves backed the university's withdrawal of recognition from Dickhuth's habilitation. Furthermore, textual analysis suggested that some of the textual extracts in question appeared to have been composed by Dickhuth himself. Also, these dissertations had been submitted only after the submission of Dickhuth's own dissertation. The various timelines meant that it was impossible that Dickhuth had himself copied the questionable passages in his dissertation text.Uli Homann, Beitrag auf SWR4 Radio S√ºdbaden vom 28. Mai 2014. One of the professors identified in this context was J√∂rg R√ºdiger Siewert, the medical director at the University Clinic. He had urged that recognition for Dickhuth's habilitation be rescinded in order to avoid giving out the impression that academic misconduct was not viewed with sufficient seriousness at Freiburg. Reports subsequently emerged alleging that Siewert's own habilitation dissertation, submitted many years earlier, was suspiciously similar to the doctoral dissertation of his former colleague, Hans-Fred Weiser.S√∂nke Iwersen, Jan Keuchel: Dr. med. Plagiat. In: Handelsblatt. 5. November 2014 In September 2014 the withdrawal of recognition from Dickhuth's dissertation became final. The Habilitation Committee had not accepted the legal challenge which Dickhuth had himself withdrawn on 12 September 2014. There was talk of \\"a deal\\". Disciplinary proceedings against Dickhuth were suspended on 9 September 2014. He retains the status and privileges of a retired public servant and remains entitled to use the title \\"Professor\\", having properly fulfilled his duties as a professor. In February 2016 the grounds for withdrawal of recognition for Dickhuth's dissertation were made public: Dickhuth had indeed composed the contentious section of text himself, but by making them available to six of his doctoral students he had assigned authorship rights to them, in the process excluding his own rights. Not everyone has been convinced that culpability properly rests with Dickhuth. According to Gerhard Dannemann, an authority on the relevant legal background, the case can be persuasively made that it was, in fact, the doctoral students who were the plagiarists. A lengthy analysis of the affair appeared in the journal Laborjournal, and concluded that Dickhuth should not have been deprived of his academic qualification. According to this analysis, Dickhuth could be seen as a pawn, sacrificed to prop up the declining reputation of the University Clinic as a way to avoid budget cuts. In pursuit of that objective, however, the university had expended a seven-digit sum. In other known cases involving habilitation dissertations by top academics in the Medical Faculty, the university management had stayed silent, neither passing the scripts to the relevant investigatory commission, nor even informing the physicians implicated. The report also included the charge against the relevant sub- committee of the habilitation committee that its work had been \\"slapdash and error-ridden\\" (\\"schlampig und fehlerhaft\\"). According to the \\"Laborjournal\\" piece the subcommittee chairman Norbert S√ºdkamp's own habilitation dissertation had included \\"agreements\\" in its figures and tables with those appearing in three other dissertations. The report concluded that instead of purporting to revoke Dikhuth's habilitation, the university should have revoked the doctorates awarded to his former doctoral pupils, the misses Orlowska and Wehinger. == References == Category:20th-century German physicians Category:21st-century German physicians Category:German sports physicians Category:University of Freiburg faculty Category:People from Braunschweig Category:1947 births Category:Living people ","title":"Hans-Hermann Dickhuth"},{"id":"56614816","text":"Christopher James Calhoun Tynan (born July 11, 1966) is a Canadian former rugby union player who played as scrum-half. ==Career== Tynan played rugby union for Meraloma at club level.

Produced by Johnny Sandlin, the album was released in October 1971 by Capricorn Records. Cowboy formed in 1969 by songwriters Tommy Talton and Scott Boyer. The group was signed to Macon, Georgia-based Capricorn Records by the suggestion of Duane Allman, guitarist and leader of the Allman Brothers Band. Cowboy's first album, Reach for the Sky, was released in 1970, and they supported the Allman Brothers on a national tour between 1970‚Äì71. 5'll Getcha Ten was recorded at both Capricorn's studio in Macon and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Sheffield, Alabama, as the former was still under construction at the time. ==Background== 5'll Getcha Ten was released in October 1971. Songwriter and co-founder Talton remembered that while the LP carried the carefree nature of its predecessor, it reflected a maturation in their musicianship, honed while on the road touring. \\"There was a sense that this is our job now [...] Suddenly we owed money to our record company,\\" he recalled. The group had double the songs necessary for recording a new album, as they were frequently writing. \\"All My Friends\\" was inspired by the numerous friends who would stop by the band's rural farmhouse in Macon where they often resided. And Gregg Allman later covered the song on his ‚ÄúLaid Back‚Äù album in 1973. \\"The Wonder\\"‚Äîa staunch anti-war anthem‚Äîwas written by John McKenze, who was a friend of the band from their beginnings in Florida. Much of Talton's lyricism comes from a spiritual place, though he has said it held no basis in organized religion. In a later reissue for the album's liner notes, he explains that the song \\"5'll Getcha Ten\\" was penned after experiencing a turbulent ride through a storm while on the way to a performance in Atlanta. \\"It's just my little personal observation about how sometimes we don't pay attention to the magnitude of it all,\\" he said. \\"Please Be with Me\\"‚Äîperhaps the band‚Äôs best-known song‚Äîwas written by Boyer in just fifteen minutes in a hotel room late in the recording process. Duane Allman plays dobro on the song.

The food safety crisis was caused by arsenic entering the supply chain through impure sugar which had been made with contaminated sulphuric acid. The illness was prevalent across the Midlands and North West England, with Manchester being the most heavily affected. Originally misdiagnosed as alcoholic neuropathy, the main epidemic was only recognised after several months. Additionally, investigation into the outbreak found other sources of arsenic in beer, which had been unknowingly poisoning thousands in decades preceding the outbreak. ==Misdiagnosis and investigation== This mass poisoning is unusual in that it was not noticed for four months. The doctors, seeing patients who were usually heavy drinkers and who showed muscle weakness and numbness of the hands or feet, initially thought that the patients were suffering from \\"alcoholic neuritis\\". Nevertheless, a marked increase in the number of cases was noted, with 41 people succumbing to peripheral neuritis, multiple neuritis or alcoholic neuritis and 66 people perishing from alcoholism in the four months of the outbreak, while the previous seven months revealed only 22. These cases of neuritis were eventually connected to cases of skin discolouration previously thought to be unrelated. Ernest Reynolds, the doctor responsible for making the connection, also noted that only one substance would cause these symptoms: arsenic. He also noted that heavy drinkers who drank mainly spirits seemed less affected than beer drinkers. He gathered samples for analysis from the taverns frequented by his patients, which confirmed the presence of arsenic in the beer they consumed. ==Source of the poisoning== Once the breweries affected were identified, investigation as to where the arsenic came from were instituted. It was found that the arsenic was present in invert sugar provided to the breweries by Bostock & Co. of Garston. In order to decrease costs in the tight-margin English beer market, some breweries substituted high-quality barley malt with low-quality barley malt supplemented with sugar. This practice was somewhat controversial; as part of the Pure Beer movement, an inquiry on the use of brewing substitutes had been called. This inquiry, starting in 1896 and ending in 1899, had concluded that brewing substitutes were not \\"deleterious materials\\" under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875 and that further legislation was not required. This sugar was made by acid hydrolysis of starch, where starch is heated in the presence of an acid in order to form glucose. Such a method was not new, and had been employed commercially since at least 1814. Bostock & Co. used sulphuric acid to perform the acid hydrolysis. This acid, purchased from Nicholson & Sons, was made from pyrites which contained arsenic, which remained in the final product. John Nicholson & Sons, of Leeds, had provided sulphuric acid to Bostock & Co. since 1888. For most of the length of the business relationship, the acid provided was free from arsenic. However, in March 1900, Nicholson started supplying unpurified sulphuric acid containing arsenic. This practice continued until November 1900, when the acid was found to be the cause of the outbreak. Nicholson claimed that they did not know the nature of Bostock's use of the acid, and that they could have provided arsenic-free acid if requested. ===Alternate sources of arsenic in beer=== Once the main source of the outbreak had been identified as arsenic poisoning, further investigation into arsenic contamination of beer was undertaken. Eventually, it was found that arsenic was also introduced into beer by the malted barley. In the kilning stage of malting, the barley humidity content is reduced by drying the grain with the hot vapours of a fire, usually fuelled by coke or coal. It was found that when arsenic is present in the fuel, it could then be deposited upon the barley before steeping, and therefore would be present in the final product. Investigation into the outbreak uncovered that most cases of alcoholic neuropathy endemic to Manchester were, in fact, misdiagnosed arsenic poisoning, with this alternate route being responsible for the poisoning of thousands in the years preceding the outbreak. ====Halifax 1902 beer poisoning==== This method of contamination was deemed responsible for an outbreak in the borough of Halifax in January and February 1902 where 13-14 cases of arsenic poisoning were noted, with 3 fatalities. The culprit in this case was deemed to be malt dried over gas coke. ==Reaction== After the cause of the poisoning was reported by the media, a considerable reduction in beer consumption was noted in the region. The response from the brewing industry was mixed. There was a strong, immediate reaction from some breweries, led by the large Manchester brewery Groves and Whitnall, who went as far as sending out telegrams to all the taverns and inns that had purchased their beer. Breweries disposed of thousands of barrels of beer by dumping them in the city's sewers. Other breweries were slower to respond, with fines being handed out to breweries whose beer samples could still be purchased by investigators. Additionally, one pub was fined for selling contaminated beer after they were notified of the presence of arsenic by the manufacturer. In Lancashire, 23 taverns and pubs were prosecuted for violations under section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875. Bostock & Co. went into liquidation, and sued Nicholson & Sons for damages, for breach of an implied condition under the Sale of Goods Act 1893. The case was heard by Mr Justice Bruce in the High Court: the judge awarded Bostock the price of the contaminated acid and the value of their spoiled products, but no special damages for the loss of goodwill or for the damages claimed by the brewers, incurred by using the contaminated product in their sugar's manufacture. Nicholson & Sons survived, and was later acquired by B. Laporte, now Laporte plc. The poisoning resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission led by Lord Kelvin, which submitted a preliminary report in 1901 and a final report in 1903. ==Long-term effects== The effects on the beer market were short-lived, and consumption of beer resumed over the course of the year. Attempts to revive the pure beer movement were nullified by the Commission's report, and by the fact that arsenic was present in malted barley as well as sugar. There seemed to be no direct effects on legislation resulting from the incident. In 1901, a considerable decline in the birth rate was noted in Manchester, Salford and Liverpool. This decline was greater in areas most affected, leading the Royal Commission to conclude that the epidemic was the cause. ==References== Category:1900 disasters Category:1900 in England Category:1901 in England Category:1900 health disasters Category:Adulteration Category:Arsenic Category:Beer Category:Food safety Category:Food safety scandals Category:Mass poisoning Category:Health disasters in England Category:Food safety in the United Kingdom Category:1902 in England Category:1900 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:1902 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:1902 health disasters ","title":"1900 English beer poisoning"},{"id":"56614967","text":"Fernanda Alves (born 29 June 1985) is a volleyball player from Brazil.

It is similar in appearance to other Kerivoula species, but has a genetic divergence of 12%, which was deemed great enough to warrant naming it as a new species. The species name \\"titania\\" is a reference to the character Titania from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The authors named the bat after the \\"Queen of the Fairies\\" to reflect \\"the nymph-like nature of this forest bat.\\" ==Description== It is considered a medium-sized member of its genus. Its forearm is long. It has large, mostly hairless ears that are long. It has tall and narrow tragi that are long. Its tail is long. It weighs . Its skull has a distinctly flat appearance. Its dental formula is for a total of 38 teeth. Its individual hairs are tricolored: their bases are black, their middles are pale gray, and their tips are dark gray. ==Biology and ecology== It is nocturnal and roosts in sheltered places during the day Its flattened skull suggests that it roosts in constricted spaces such as under tree bark or in crevices. Not much is known about its reproduction, but a female in late-stage pregnancy was once documented in early May. Lactating females have been recorded in mid May and early June. It is one of the known natural reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus. In one study in Taiwan, 10% of individuals tested positive for the SARS coronavirus. ==Range and habitat== This species was first described from eastern Cambodia, with additional specimens from Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. In 2012, it was first documented in Hainan Island of China and Taiwan. This discovery made it only the third bat of its genus to be documented in China. ==Conservation== It is currently assessed as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large range, no major threats to this species have been identified, and it is not likely to be declining quickly. ==References== ==External links== *An image of this species Category:Mammals described in 2007 Category:Bats of Southeast Asia Category:Kerivoulinae ","title":"Titania's woolly bat"},{"id":"56615032","text":"Canon Lewis Memorial Hall, Ransom Road, Nottingham 1907 Enfield Chambers, Low Pavement, Nottingham 1909-10 William Richard Gleave ARIBA (1868 - 8 January 1933) was a surveyor and architect based in Nottingham. ==History== He was born in 1868, the son of Thomas Gleave (1838-1881) shipbuilder and Anne Jane Hindley (1841-1871).

The act increases police powers related to impaired driving‚Äîincluding authorizing mandatory alcohol screening, without suspicion that the person is impaired‚Äîand it increases the maximum punishments for driving related offences in the Criminal Code. ==Provisions== The act creates a criminal offence related to the concentration of a drug in a person's blood while driving,Third Reading, section 1 specific blood concentration levels that would be illegal would be prescribed in regulations by the Governor in Council.Third Reading, section 2 If a peace officer suspects that a person has operated a vehicle under the influence of a drug, they would be authorized to order that person to provide a sample of a \\"bodily substance\\".Third Reading, section 3 (3) The act would further allow a peace officers to demand that a person provide a breath sample, in order to screen for alcohol impairment, without suspicion that the person is impaired.Third Reading, section 15 at 320.27 (2) The act also increases the punishments for driving-related offences. The maximum punishment for offences causing bodily harm would increase from 10 years to 14 years, and offences causing death would increase from 14 years to life in prison.Third Reading, section 15, at 320.‚Äç2 Dangerous driving, failure to stop after an accident, and flight from a peace officer would also see increased maximum sentences‚Äîdoubling from 5 years to 10 years in prison.Third Reading, section 15, at 320.‚Äç19 (5)Former sentences repealed at section 14 of Third Reading ==Reception== The provisions of the act related to alcohol screening have been the subject of debate in the legal community. Rob De Luca of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association argued in the Toronto Star that the change would be \\"a fundamental and troubling change in our legal system [...] the presumption of innocence is replaced with a presumption of guilt\\", Kathryn Pentz of the Canadian Bar Association argued that it would violate section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and \\"that it would not withstand constitutional challenge\\", Senator Serge Joyal argued that it would violate section 9 and 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On the other side of the debate, it has been argued that the change is necessary, reasonable and constitutional. Among the supporters of the act are legal scholars Peter Hogg and Marc Gold. Canada's Privacy Commissioner stated that the act \\"strikes the appropriate balance from a privacy perspective\\" and that the government \\"has made a reasonable case for the necessity and proportionality\\" of mandatory screening. Among the general public, according to a poll by Nanos Research, 44 percent of respondents support mandatory alcohol screening, while 55 percent oppose it. Senators Murray Sinclair and Ren√©e Dupuis raised concerns that the act would worsen racial profiling. Sinclair suggested the use of body cameras and record keeping by officers, in order to better monitor police behaviour. Jody Wilson-Raybould responded to concerns by stating that the act \\"does not change the responsibility that law enforcement has to ensure fair and equal application of the law.\\" An official from the Department of Justice noted that the Minister of Justice would be required to prepare a report on the legislation's success three years after it is passed, and suggested that racial profiling could be reduced through police training. Concerns have also been raised with regard to the effectiveness of drug screening methods, and possible negative effects the act could have on medical marijuana users. The concerns focus on the length of time THC stays in the body, possibly for days after use, which critics believe could lead to arrests of people who aren't impaired. Jody Wilson-Raybould argued that requiring police officers to have suspicion of impairment, before screening, would serve as \\"inherent protection to avoid charging drivers who were not actually impaired,\\" and that the screening methods \\"are consistent with the approach taken in other jurisdictions.\\" Critics have argued that the smell of marijuana in a vehicle could lead an officer to suspect impairment, regardless of whether it has been used by the driver, therefore leading to the requirement being ineffective.

This was followed by his first engagements at the Manitoba Theatre Center and, from 1968 to 1969, at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario. During a tour of Germany in 1970, the potential of German theatre inspired him so much that he decided to work in Germany from then on. He initially worked as an assistant director at the Ulmer Theater, where he had his first engagement at a German theater between 1971 and 1973. Further commitments followed at the Stadttheater Heidelberg (1973-1978), the Basler Theater (1978-1980) and at the Schauspiel Bonn (1980-1987). In 1982, he founded the improvisation theatre Springmaus in Bonn, where he also performs his own solo programs. He became known to a wide audience as Erich Schiller in the ARD series Lindenstra√üe, which he played from 1991 until the end of 2015. In 2011, he had a guest appearance in the comedy series Pastewka. In 2012, Mockridge published his book Je oller, je doller: So vergreisen Sie richtig. In it, he deals humorously with aging. In 2015, he hosted the Golden Internet Prize for Seniors in Berlin, where pioneering online projects are being honored under the patronage of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior. ==Personal life== Mockridge is married to Italian-German actress Margie Kinsky and lives in the Endenich district of Bonn.

It was broadcast on ABC from January 26, 1947, until December 30, 1956. Beginning July 25, 1948, the program was also broadcast via shortwave radio to 58 other countries by the World Wide Broadcasting Foundation. The Greatest Story Ever Told, the title of which was used for Fulton Oursler's 1949 book, used dramatized sketches to depict events in the life of Jesus Christ. As in the book, the words spoken by Jesus in the radio program came directly from the Bible. The premiere episode was \\"Parable of the Good Samaritan\\". The program was sponsored by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, but it lacked commercials, having the sponsorship announced only at the end of each episode. When the broadcast run ended, the affiliation between the program and Goodyear was described as \\"one of [the] longest institutional broadcast advertising campaigns\\". An interdenominational advisory board provided guidance for the show. ==Personnel== Actors on The Greatest Story Ever Told performed in anonymity, with no cast credit given. Therefore, few people knew that Warren Parker portrayed Jesus in the program's only continuing role. Norman Rose was the announcer. William Stoess composed the music and initially conducted the 35-piece orchestra, with Jacques Belasco and Willard Young following him as conductors. Young also directed the show's 16-member chorus. Wadill Catchings was the producer; Marx Loeb was the director, and Leonard Blair was Loeb's assistant. With Oursler as consultant, Henry Denker wrote the scripts, which received \\"screenwriting credit over and above the Oursler book\\" for the film The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). ==Recordings== In 1950, ABC produced more than 5,000 albums of recordings of selected episodes of The Greatest Story Ever Told, with half going to the Protestant Radio Commission and half to the National Council of Catholic Men. The Catholic group's albums were distributed to Catholic orphanages, hospitals, and schools. The Protestant group distributed its recording among ministerial groups and councils of churches. ==Recognition and critical reception== City College of New York honored The Greatest Story Ever Told as the best radio program created and broadcast in 1947. The recognition noted that the show presented its episodes \\"with superior good taste and effective listener appeal\\". In 1949, The Greatest Story Ever Told won a special George Foster Peabody Citation. The citation noted, \\"... the program has maintained such a high degree of religious integrity, and has been so free of denominational bias or prejudice, that it has won the acclaim of newspapers, magazines, trade journals, and religious leaders alike. ... The Greatest Story Ever Told has occupied a peculiar niche, carved by both quality and popularity...\\" Also in 1949, the Freedoms Foundation named the show Best Radio Program. On February 9, 1947, Jack Gould wrote in The New York Times, \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told is a program of extraordinary beauty and reverence, which without reservation may be listed as one of the most significant ethereal achievements in recent years.\\" He went on to call the show \\"a rare and successful fusion of religion, art and commerce ...\\" ==Television== On December 2 and 23, 1951, ABC-TV broadcast episodes of The Greatest Story Ever Told. The first was \\"The Story of Lazarus\\", and the second was \\"No Room at the Inn\\". In 1952, CBS obtained the rights to broadcast a televised version of The Greatest Story Ever Told, to be sponsored by Goodyear. An article in the trade publication Billboard reported that the half-hour program would be broadcast one Sunday afternoon in each of April, May and June 1952, and \\"it will be shown weekly next season\\". == References == == External links == ===Logs=== *Log of episodes of The Greatest Story Ever Told from Jerry Haendiges Vintage Radio Logs *Log of episodes of The Greatest Story Ever Told from radioGOLDINdex ===Streaming=== *Episodes of The Greatest Story Ever Told from Dumb.com *Episodes of The Greatest Story Ever Told from Old Time Radio Researchers Group Library Category:1947 radio programme debuts Category:1956 radio programme endings Category:ABC radio programs Category:American radio dramas Category:Religious radio programs ","title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told (radio program)"},{"id":"56615418","text":"Schilcherland DAC is an official wine region in Austria.

She was the great-niece and unofficially adopted daughter of former First Lady Sarah Childress Polk. Sallie's mother died when she was only a few months old. Sallie lived with her great-grandmother, who gave Sallie to her daughter Sarah after the death of Sarah's husband President James K. Polk. Sallie was raised at the Polks' private residence Polk Place. She married George Fall in 1865, and they had a daughter Saidee. Sallie inherited the Polk estate upon Sarah's death in 1891, including several artifacts and papers from the late president which she later sold and donated to the Library of Congress. Sarah also willed some of the president's items to Saidee. Shortly before Sallie died in 1924, she and her daughter co-founded the James K. Polk Memorial Association. In 1929 Saidee worked with the state of Tennessee to acquire the president's home in Columbia which was then opened to the public as a museum. ==Biography== 303x303px Sallie Jetton was born in Rutherford County, Tennessee in 1847 to Mary Childress and Robert Jetton, a farmer and land owner. Mary Childress was the daughter of Anderson Childress, the older brother of First Lady Sarah Childress Polk. Sallie's mother died a few months after her birth from childbirth complications. Her father was unable to raise her alone, so she was taken in by her great-grandmother Elizabeth Childress. She stayed with her great-grandmother for a short period until the death of President James K. Polk in 1849. The president's wife Sarah mourned her husband's death deeply and became a recluse, rarely leaving her home Polk Place. Elizabeth, who was in her 70s, brought Sallie to Polk Place and suggested Sarah should care for her. Sarah agreed and assumed guardianship of Sallie after 1850. Many who knew Sarah seemed skeptical of her bringing a child into her home. Judge John Catron would make the comment, \\"You are not the one Madam, to have charge of a little child; you, who have always been absorbed in the political and social affairs...\\" But nonetheless Sarah still assumed guardianship, and brought in a nurse and maid to watch the young girl. Sarah would often refer to Sallie as her daughter, and newspapers referred to Sallie as her adopted daughter. Sarah would take great pride in raising Sallie. Sallie stayed with Sarah for the rest of the former First Lady's life. In 1865, Sarah hosted Sallie's marriage to George Fall in the main Parlor of Polk Place. The newlyweds moved in with Sarah until after the birth of their child Saidee in 1871. Sarah greatly adored the little girl. After Sarah's death in 1891 Sallie became the sole heir to the Polk estate as Sarah willed the Polk belongings, the contents of Polk Place along with the presidential papers to Sallie. Sarah bequeathed some of the personal items of the President to Sallie's daughter Saidee, including the president's watch and glasses. Sallie sold and donated the presidential papers to the Library of Congress in the early 1900s. She also donated one of Sarah's inaugural gowns and a fan to the Smithsonian. In 1905 Sallie opened her own home in Nashville for social gatherings to exhibit the items she had inherited from Sarah and to tell the legacy of her great-uncle president Polk. During these gatherings and other social events she would introduce herself as the daughter to the president. Sallie continued living in Nashville after Sarah's death throughout her later life. ==Death and legacy== Sallie fell ill in 1924 and died July 22, at the age of 77. Newspapers throughout the country published \\"The Adopted daughter of President Polk Dies.\\" The vast majority of the items she did not donate to the Library of Congress or the Smithsonian were left to her daughter, Saidee. Shortly before her death she helped her daughter Saidee found the James K. Polk Memorial Association along with other Nashville women, with the main intent of preserving the president's legacy. In 1929 Sallie's daughter Saidee worked together with the state of Tennessee to purchase the only surviving private residence which the president lived in. The home, located in Columbia, Tennessee, was constructed by the president's father Samuel in 1816, and was the president's home for six years before his marriage to Sarah Childress in 1824. On acquisition of the home in 1929 The James K. Polk Memorial Association founded the James K. Polk Home, the presidential museum of James K. Polk. The contents of Polk Place that Sallie inherited and later left to her daughter Saidee would be brought to the museum. Later the fountain, the garden urns, and a gate from the exterior of Polk Place were moved to the property. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * == External links == * Sarah Polk Fall at Find-a-Grave Category:1847 births Category:1924 deaths Sarah Category:People from Rutherford County, Tennessee Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee Category:American socialites Category:Philanthropists from Tennessee Category:American adoptees Category:Adoptees adopted by relations Category:Burials at Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville) ","title":"Sarah Polk Fall"},{"id":"56615425","text":"The 2002 Wismilak International was a women's tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts in Bali, Indonesia that was part of the Tier III category of the 2002 WTA Tour.

His father owned a restaurant and died when Araki was a teenager. Araki began painting at an early age and at age seven entered the tutelage of an old Chinese painter who his parents were friends with. He studied traditional Chinese painting until moving back to Japan after World War II. He then pursued graphic design and industrial design, and studied under modernist and avant-garde artists in Tokyo. Araki died in 2010. == Work == Installation view of paintings by Minol Araki at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Inspired in part by Raymond Loewy's book Never Leave Well Enough Alone, Araki started a career in industrial design in the 1950s. In the 1960s, he started a network of design studios. During his career as a designer, Araki worked on housewares such as lamps, calendars, and organizers, and by≈çbu, traditional Japanese folding screens. In the 1970s, Araki was mentored by painter Zhang Daqian. After Zhang's death, Araki created five paintings demonstrating his mentor's influence and his personal interest in modern Japanese painting methods. These paintings, which are each over 70 feet long, contain multiple panels illustrating landscapes, dragons, and other natural scenes. In addition to influences from Zhang, these paintings also demonstrate influence from Bada Shanren, Ben Shahn, and medieval Japanese Zen painters. Araki's work was also influenced by his travels, and by painters Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Egon Schiele. Another interest was Pablo Picasso and other contemporary abstract painters. Through various styles, Araki is known for his literati painting and expressing his unique perspective as someone with various cultural influences, both from upbringing and his travels. Araki's best-known piece is Snow Monkeys at Play in Autumn and Winter, a work that is inspired by the Nihonga painting style of 20th-century Japan. He is also known for a series of lotus paintings. Unlike most artists, Araki did not collect old paintings, preferring to save antique painting instruments, like brushes, ink and inkstones, and paper. This may have been inspired by his mentor Zhang's work in textile dyeing. For most of his career, Araki did not exhibit or sell any of his pieces. His business work allowed him the financial freedom to pursue his art without having the need to sell it. On his art, Araki said, \\"My painting is a celebration of nature, a grateful song to all forms of creation expressed through brush painting. By drawing from both East and West, I hope to achieve a perspective which is international, a bridge between cultures.\\" == Collections == Araki's work has been exhibited in the collections and/or traveling exhibits of the following: * Erik Thomsen Gallery in New York * Metropolitan Museum of Art * Minneapolis Institute of Art * National Museum of History in Taipei * Phoenix Art Museum (1999) == References == Category:20th-century Japanese painters Category:Japanese interior designers Category:1928 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Artists from Dalian Category:Painters from Liaoning ","title":"Minol Araki"},{"id":"56615542","text":"An advanced work, advance-work or advanced outwork is a fortification or outwork in front of the main defensive buildingCurl, James Stevens (2006).

Within these advanced works often lived relatives of the knightly family whose ancestral seat was in the castle itself. As a result, the advanced works became manor houses and were known locally as schlosses. They were suitable for defending against minor attacks and offered the village population a degree of protection. In the case of major attacks they also acted as an early warning system for the castle. Because the advanced works were supposed to function autonomously, a link with agricultural estates was possible, such estates then became granges or vorwerkenden Gutsh√∂fen. Later they also took over administrative tasks. Over the course of time these advanced works detached themselves from the castle and became independent estates. ==See also== * Folwark * List of established military terms == References == Category:Fortification (architectural elements) Category:Castle architecture ","title":"Advanced work"},{"id":"56615544","text":"Emma Jane Gay (1830 ‚Äì March 15, 1919) (also known as E. Jane Gay) was an American woman who devoted her life to social reform and photography. She is notable for her photographs of the Nez Perce, which she took during a federal expedition led by American ethnologist and anthropologist Alice Cunningham Fletcher. == Early life == Emma Jane Gay was born in 1830 in Nashua, New Hampshire, to Ziba Gay (1796‚Äì1864) and Mary (Kennedy) Gay (1798‚Äì1873). She received her education at the Brooklyn Female Academy in New York, where she first befriended Alice Cunningham Fletcher. Gay's education at the Academy included the sciences, religion, and homemaking. == Career == Gay's first job was as a teacher. In 1856 she accompanied her friend Catherin Melville to Macon, Georgia, to open a school for girls. The school closed in 1860, which prompted Melville and Gay to move to Washington, D.C. to serve as administrators for a school for deaf young children. From 1861 through 1865, Gay worked as a nurse with Dorothea Dix during the Civil War. After the war, Gay served as a tutor for President Andrew Johnson's grandchildren, then worked as a clerk in a dead letter office. When this job ended in 1883, Gay had a brief period of unemployment. In 1888, Gay reconnected with Alice Cunningham Fletcher, and they renewed their friendship. She taught herself photography during this time. In 1889, the United States Department of the Interior appointed Fletcher as a special agent to lead an expedition to Nebraska and Idaho, with the intent to apportion tribal lands among the Winnebagos and the Nez Perce as part of the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887. Gay accompanied Fletcher on this journey as a cook, maid, and secretary. Gay had failed to earn a permit from the federal government to serve as the \\"official\\" expedition photographer, but during the expedition she took over 400 photographs of the Nez Perce. In 1909, she worked with her niece to publish the letters written during that expedition, along with half of the photographs, in a two-volume book titled Choup-nit-ki: With the Nez Perc√©s. == Photography == Gay's photographs of the Nez Perce have only recently earned critical acclaim. On the surface, the black and white photographs paint a positive image of \\"civilized\\" Nez Perce in Western attire, working on farms or ranches, living in cabins and engaging in manual labor. Domesticity appears to be celebrated in these photographs. On the surface, these photographs showed the \\"success\\" of the government land appropriation program. Contemporary scholars, however, have noted themes of nationalism, colonialism, and racism in Gay's work. Several photographs feature the white, large Fletcher standing tall while the Nez Perce subjects work in the background or in subservient poses. Gay had also captured the heteronormative gendering of labor, in addition to the racial distribution of labor, in the photographs. ==Gallery== \\"Monday Morning at Camp McBeth\\".jpgMonday Morning at Camp McBeth, Idaho State Historical Society Emma Jane Gay ‚Äì Nez Perc√©.jpgNez Perc√© Emma Jane Gay ‚Äì E. Jane Gay, self portrait.jpgself portrait == Personal life == Gay neither married nor had children, but had close ties with her niece and namesake Emma Jane Gay. After the Western expedition she had embarked upon with Fletcher, Gay returned to Washington, D.C., where she and Alice Fletcher shared a house until Gay and Emma traveled to England for an extended stay. With Emma's help, Jane Gay created a scrapbook of edited letters recounting her years in Idaho, illustrated with some of the photographs she had taken, and additional artwork by Emma. Emma, who had studied bookbinding, bound the scrapbook into two volumes and built a wooden case for the work, which was titled \\"Choup-nit-ki: With the Nez Perc√©s.\\" The unpublished work was later donated to the Schlesinger Library by Jane Gay Dodge. Gay decided to remain in Somerset, England, where she lived with her beloved companion Dr. Caroline Sturge. After World War One, Sturge used some of her inheritance to have a cottage built in Winscombe, Somerset, where she and Gay could live out their final years; Gay died in this cottage, called \\"Kamiah\\", on March 15, 1919. In multiple texts Gay is referred to as Fletcher's \\"companion\\", living in \\"domestic partnership\\" or \\"Boston Marriage\\" with her. The roles that Gay played during the expedition‚Äîas well as the fact that she never married a man and had intimate relationships with other women over the course of her lifetime‚Äîhave led scholars to believe that she was a lesbian. Due to this fact, art historians identify Gay as the first American lesbian photographer. == References == == External links == * Jane Gay Dodge Collection, Schlesinger Library, Harvard University * Jane Gay Photograph Collection, Digital Collections, Idaho State Historical Society * Out of the Shadows (video), Idaho Experience 07/18/2019.

Subtitled 'The design of everyday life' it looks at the technologies that are transforming the world at an ever increasing rate. Greenfield's take on the influence of technologies such as blockchain and digital fabrication is generally speaking a pessimistic one. He is concerned about the atomisation of society as experience becomes individualised, and about how we are unwittingly handing over vast amounts of power to faceless corporations with very little debate from politicians and other leaders about what we actually want from technology. In the opening chapter on smartphones for example, whilst marvelling that the entire cartographic knowledge of the world and even our place in it is now available to us on a flat screen that we can hold in our hands, we are for the most part blissfully unaware of all of the interconnected technologies - the NAVSTAR satellite GPS systems, the vast data centres that process the information, the networking and wireless infrastructure that transmit the signals - that allow this functionality to exist. More importantly, Greenfield notes, so quickly has using a smartphone map ceased to be a wonder and become just part of every day live that \\"we have become reliant on the network to accomplish our ordinary goals\\".Greenfield, Adam, Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life, Verso, 2017. In the chapter on artificial intelligence (subtitled 'The eclipse of human discretion') Greenfield notes that machines can now do things that were until recently thought to be a uniquely human preserve, such as winning the strategy game Go or creating a highly plausible painting in the style of Rembrandt. In these and other areas where people had the edge, machines can now outperform human beings. AI learns fast and it will not be long before \\"autonomous algorithmic systems acquire an effectively human level of cognitive ability\\". What's more, he says, it is difficult to see how this eventuality can be prevented. The societal effects of automation also come under scrutiny. The most commonly held job in 29 of the 50 US states is truck driver. This will also be one of the first jobs to be automated out of existence. What will happen to the truck drivers then, the author asks. The book concludes with four possible scenarios that might play out as automation plays an increasing role in the mediation of every aspect of life. == Chapters == * Smartphone: The networking of the self * The internet of things: A planetary mesh of perception and response * Augmented reality: An interactive overlay on the world * Digital fabrication: Towards a political economy * Cryptocurrency: The computational guarantee of value * Blockchain beyond Bitcoin: A trellis for post-human institutions * Automation: The annihilation of work * Machine learning: The algorithmic production of knowledge * Artificial intelligence: The eclipse of human discretion * Radical technologies: The design of everyday life ==Critical reception== Radical technologies received positive reviews.

The yellow border of the double ocellus is narrower and somewhat dull in the male, and broader and light yellow in the female. The border of the ocellus is yellow on the underside of both sexes, being broader than above. The hindwing beneath is thinly dusted with whitish in the male and bears a small white spot at the apex of the cell. In the female the underside of the hindwing is more densely dusted with whitish, the dark dentate median band therefore being more prominent than in the male, in which sex it contrasts but little with the ground. Before the distal margin there is an arched, narrow, dark dentate line, proximally to which there is a small white dot each in cellules 2 and 4.

The first season premiered on Nickelodeon on March 2, 2019, while the second season premiered on February 22, 2020. Both seasons are the first of the television series to be produced by Hasbro's production studio Allspark, as well as being the first in the franchise to have all toys manufactured and distributed by Hasbro. The seasons were produced using footage, costumes, and props from the 36th entry Japanese Super Sentai series Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters which aired in 2012. As a result, Beast Morphers marks the first time the television franchise has gone backwards to adapt a Super Sentai series that was previously skipped over. Beast Morphers was originally to be produced by Saban Brands. During pre-production, Hasbro acquired the Power Rangers franchise and other entertainment assets from Saban Brands and the latter company subsequently closed on July 2, 2018. ==Plot== Scientists in the city of Coral Harbor have discovered a way to convert the infinite-power of the Morphing Grid into a physical substance called \\"Morph-X\\", providing the city with a source of unlimited clean energy. To protect the city, a secret agency known as Grid Battleforce combines Morph-X with animal DNA to create a new team of Power Rangers. Now the Beast Morpher Rangers: Devon Daniels, Ravi Shaw, and Zoey Reeves must defend the Morphin Grid from Evox, an evil sentient computer virus from another dimension and his evil avatar clones of original Beast Morphers candidates Blaze and Roxy, who were rendered comatose. After the three of them are transported to the Cyber Dimension, Evox, Cybervillain Blaze, and Cybervillain Roxy gain its de facto ruler Scrozzle as an ally as he helps them in their plan to return Evox to Earth. As the Rangers battle Evox's robot monsters, they gain two new additions to the team: Nate Silva, the head researcher and scientist of Grid Battleforce who becomes the Gold Ranger and Steel, a robot Nate was forced to create, who becomes the Silver Ranger. In the second season, Evox possesses Mayor Daniels and plots to finish what he started with the help of Scrozzle, who uses a machine to replenish the Blaze and Roxy avatars as robots. Along the way, the Rangers uncover Evox's origins and receive help from the Dino Charge Rangers and allies of the RPM rangers to defeat Evox and his minions once and for all. ==Episodes== ==Cast and characters== ===Rangers=== *Rorrie D.

In a joint statement on February 15, 2018, Saban announced that it would not renew its master toy license with Bandai going forward and that the current license would expire on April 1, 2019, ending a 25-year partnership dating back to 1993 with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The following day on February 16, 2018 at New York Toy Fair 2018, Hasbro announced that it had acquired the master toy license from Saban Brands, revealed a re-branded logo for the Power Rangers franchise and mentioned that their contract with Saban Brands included an option to negotiate the purchase of the Power Rangers franchise from Saban Brands at a later time if they chose. The next day on February 17, 2018, at the New York Toy Fair, Hasbro announced that their toys would start to appear in April 2019 and that the Super Sentai series Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters would be the first season adapted under the re-branded Power Rangers logo as Power Rangers Beast Morphers. On May 1, 2018, Hasbro announced that it had agreed to purchase the Power Rangers franchise from Saban Brands in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $522 million. On May 25, 2018, it was revealed that Saban Brands was preparing to lay off a majority of its employees with Saban Brands ceasing operation on July 2, 2018, though its parent company Saban Capital Group would remain open for business. Judd \\"Chip\\" Lynn, who resumed executive producer duties for Power Rangers since Dino Charge, returned for Beast Morphers. The first season finished filming on December 20, 2018. The second season began filming about a month later. Filming for the second season finished on May 22, 2019.

He started teaching in 1920 at Montana State University and then in 1930 at the School of Engineering, Stanford University where he taught until 1962. He is known for his work in Engineering Economics with his textbook first published in 1930. Grant was the intellectual heir of work performed by John Charles Lounsbury Fish who published Engineering Economics: First Principles in 1923, providing the critical bridge between Grant and the pioneering effort of Arthur M. Wellington in his engineering economics work of the 1870s. Grant was awarded many academic and professional honors such as an honorary doctorate in civil engineering at Montana State University; Fellow of the American Statistical Association, American Society for Quality(ASQ) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science as well as membership in the National Academy of Engineering in 1987.Science, New Series, Vol. 235, No. 4796 (Mar. 27, 1987), p. 1569 He was part of the effort to found the American Society for Quality which awarded Grant its top award, the Shewhart Medal in 1952. In 1967, ASQ created the E.L. Grant Award which is granted annually to the individual who has been deemed to have demonstrated outstanding leadership in the areas of educational programs in quality. Joseph Juran said that Grant was a \\"quiet doer who didn‚Äôt receive enough credit for what he did\\" and did much to advance the field of quality to what it was in the middle of the 20th century. == Early life and career== Eugene Lodewick Grant was born on February 15, 1897, in Chicago, Illinois, to Bertrand Eugene and Eva May (Lodewick).

Grant then joined the civil engineering faculty at the University of Montana (Bozeman) in 1920. He earned a Master's degree in economics at Columbia University in 1928. ===Stanford University civil engineering department=== Grant joined the department in 1930 which was headed at the time by fellow engineering economist John Charles Lounsbury Fish where Grant started on his landmark textbook on engineering economy. He later became chair of the civil engineering department in 1947. He headed that from 1947 to 1956 while at the same time heading the Committee on Industrial Engineering which later became an independent engineering program at Stanford. ====Principles of Engineering Economy==== Following the pioneering work of Fish, Grant published his text on engineering economy with the first edition printed in 1930.Lesser Jr, Arthur. \\"Aims and content of engineering economy.\\" J. Eng. Educ 44.5 (1954): 307-313. Grant improved on Fish's work by presenting methods for short-run analyses complementing the long run methods championed by Fish and A. M.

The purpose of calculations which involve the time value of money should be to answer this question.\\" One reviewer of this 2nd edition noted that Grant's work was important and represented a specialized analytical approach to address the special problem of choosing alternatives. It helped that Grant's work avoided \\"involved mathematics\\".W. P. Fiske Review of Eugene Grant book, American Economic Review, page 803, 1938.

New York: Wiley. WorldCAT ref In 1982, the Accounting Historians Journal in an article on the historical development of traditional net present value (NPV) method with the equivalent annual cost (EAC) methods noted that the role that Grant's book on engineering economy played in the development of discounted cash flow techniques.Jones, Thomas W., and David Smith. \\"An historical perspective of net present value and equivalent annual cost.\\" Accounting Historians Journal 9.1 (1982): 103-110. Jones, et. al. noted that this development intersected the \\"...fields of engineering, economics, and accounting\\". :\\"Grant discussed applications of the present worth, the rate of return, and the equivalent annual cost methods for making capital budgeting decisions. Each of these methods is widely used today, and Grant has been recognized for the initial presentation of these methods in a single textbook.\\" Equivalence Grant introduced the concept of economic equivalence in his first edition of the Principles book noting that \\"...(a)n \\"equivalent\\" figure is one which is convertible into a given figure by the application of the proper compound interest factor. Thus the notion of equivalence requires the assumption of an interest rate.\\" Grant, 1930, page 58. Grant looked at interest as an economic sacrifice in order to determine whether or not to make the investment. He noted that accounting systems never included \\"...interest on the ownership capital as a cost; interest is only a cost when it is paid out.\\" In his revised 2nd edition, he added a whole chapter devoted to the subject defining economic equivalence as the concept that investments or payments which differ in total magnitude and made at different dates may be substituted for each other to make a fair comparison in economic studies. As Grant noted in his first edition, this required a broader definition of interest that used in accounting. ====Basic Accounting and Cost Accounting==== In 1956, Grant published Basic Accounting and Cost Accounting as a text for introductory courses for nonaccounting majors Reviewed Work(s): Basic Accounting and Cost Accounting by Eugene L. Grant and Lawrence F. Bell Review by: Jerome K.

Accounting Review. Jan 1957, Vol. 32 Issue 1, p157. 2p. Grant argued in the book that accounting should be viewed as a prerequisite for good citizenship. Grant's approach was to involve the student \\"...deeply in the mechanics of record keeping and the accounting process....(as opposed to newer ones that) ... puts more stress on the uses of accounting information than on its synthesis.\\" The book was grouped into three parts: \\"Accounting Fundamentals,\\" \\"Elements of Cost Accounting,\\" and \\"Some Accounting Topics.\\" In the later part, Grant wrote a chapter entitled \\"Some hazards in the uncritical use of accounting figures\\" in which he articulated some general principles on making decisions in business; arguing that fundamentally, business decisions are between \\"...alternative courses of action.\\"Grant, 1956, p. 353 Critical to this process was developing \\"...a clear definition of the alternatives to be considered.\\" Grant argued that the rational basis for such business decision-making was an ability to \\"...predict the consequences of choosing among the various alternatives...and it is only prospective differences among those alternatives that influence the choice...(all other matters)...are irrelevant.\\" Where \\"...probable consequences of proposed alternatives...\\" were expressed in terms of money, namely \\"relevant costs\\". Crucially, Grant noted that in such business decision-making, all relevant differences in terms of cost are future ones as past events cannot be \\"changed by a decision made today.\\" Lastly, Grant argued that no rational business decision regarding the \\"proposed investments of money could be made without recognizing the time value of money.\\" Unlike accounting which doesn't recognize a cost unless money is borrowed, economics recognized this as an opportunity cost. While one reviewer stated that \\"Mr. Grant has written a fine introduction to conventional accounting and cost principles for \\"non-accountants...\\" another criticized Grant's use of \\"...accounting-cycle illustrations in so many chapters as focal points for introducing basic techniques...\\" because it made for a difficult presentation for the students. This reviewer noted that Grant excluded classical accounting subjects such as \\"accounting systems, data processing, and internal control; assembling accounting data to aid managerial decision- making; internal and external auditing.\\" In summary, the book was criticized as a \\"...condensation rather than a distillation of basic accounting and cost accounting principles and techniques ... (and) ... the use of long involved problems to illustrate fundamental principles combine to make the book an inefficient teaching and learning tool.\\" ==Awards== * Thomas Fitch prize ASCE, (1944). * ASQC Shewhart Medal (1952). * The AIIE Founders Award (1965) * Honorary Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Montana (1973) * The IIE Engineering Economy Division‚Äôs Wellington Award (1979) * Membership in the National Academy of Engineering (1987) == Personal life == Since 1966, Grant resided in Palo Alto, California.

It stands on Berryknowes Road. The cemetery has a Jewish section containing 230 graves.http://www.scottishjewishcemeteries.org/craigton/craigton.htm The cemetery also contains 251 commonwealth war graves from the First and Second World Wars. Partly due to the proximity to Ibrox Stadium, the cemetery has strong links to Rangers Football Club. The original entrance is to the south- east. A new entrance to the north was created to serve the crematorium. The north half of the cemetery is relatively flat and open. The south half slopes fairly steeply south to north and is more densely filled with monuments. Vandalism in the cemetery is widespread. ==History== The cemetery was established in 1871 by the Craigton Cemetery Company to serve south-west Glasgow, Govan and Partick. The original cemetery extended to 30 acres on lands of Wester Craigton and Merrylands, previously owned by Robert Urquhart. The main shareholder was Thomas Reid (1831-1900) of the Govan Dye Works. Fellow directors included Morris Pollok (1831-1899) and William McOnie (1813-1894) (later Lord Provost of Glasgow). The first burial took place on 9 June 1873, being that of seven-year-old Isabella Guthrie. From 1876 to 1877 various reburials took place moving earlier graves from Blackfriars Churchyard which was removed for railway improvements. From 1881 the cemetery also permitted Jewish burials in their own section known as the \\"Bet Chaim\\" (House of Life). This section was closed in 1908. Craigton Crematorium lies close to the northern boundary and was added in 1957 to a design by James Maitland Steel. It is currently run by the Co-op Funeralcare.Craigton Crematorium, Glasgow Retrieved 1 July 2018.

Her international senior debut followed at the 1998 Goodwill Games, where she narrowly missed out on a medal in fourth place behind Batten.Official results (She had also been fourth at the 1997 Summer Universiade as a collegiate athlete).1997 Universiade Results .

The structure was built in 1927 to house goods brought to and from Cheyenne by the Union Pacific Railroad in an industrial section of Cheyenne as a flour mill, replacing structures that had performed similar functions since 1915. By 1931 the building was shared by a warehouse for electrical parts for the Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company, a potato chip factory and a chemical products company. In 1937-38 the Standard Oil Company started to use the warehouse for bulk petroleum products storage, continuing to 1963. From 1963 the building was used by Salt Creek Freightways, which had shared use from 1936. In 1973 it became a plumbing parts warehouse, and by 2003 was owned and used by a general contractor. The oldest section of the L-shaped building is a one-story masonry building, by , with a flat roof. A brick two-story section dates to 1927 and measures by . This section has a stepped parapet. A cone-story concrete block addition was built in 1936, measuring about by . Another brick addition abuts the connector, and appears to have been built as an office. Some of the masonry exhibits fire damage, attributed to its time as a potato chip factory. The facades retain a number of painted signs for the businesses that operated there.

Chyskillz was discovered by the late great hip hop legend Jam Master Jay of Run-D.M.C. who signed Onyx on his label JMJ Records. Onyx's debut album Bacdafucup, produced by Chyskillz, helped the group to become a nominee for \\"Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop New Artist\\" on American Music Awards and won \\"Best Rap Album\\" on Soul Train Music Awards. During his career, Chylow Parker has worked with well-known artists such as Large Professor, Onyx, Run-D.M.C., Biohazard, Queen, Ice Cube, Shaquille O'Neal, LL Cool J, Public Enemy and many others. Many songs were re- mixed, re-mastered and re-released after 1997. Five albums produced by Chyskillz, were certified as gold by the RIAA: Public Enemy Greatest Misses, Onyx Bacdafucup, Run-D.M.C. Down With The King, Shaquille O'Neal Shaq-Fu: Da Return and LL Cool J Mr. Smith. Two of them were certified as platinum: Onyx Bacdafucup and LL Cool J Mr. Smith. ==Early life== Chylow Parker was born in Manhattan, New York City, New York. At the age of 4 he and his family moved to Jamaica, Queens, New York. At the age of 10, Chyskillz and his family moved to Flushing, Queens. That's where he met Large Professor, Neek The Exotic and Mic Geronimo. Royal Flush used to live on the other side of the building he grew up in. 10-years-old, Chyskillz touched a pair of Technique turntables for the first time. At that moment he knew what he wanted to do with his life. In the 80's Chyskillz and Large Professor were a members of b-boy crew \\"Stay Fresh Crew\\". Chylow could do \\"Flare (acrobatic move)\\", \\"Airflare\\" and \\"Headspin\\". Chylow was a good graffiti writer, bombing the \\"I.S. 237\\" (Rachel Carson Intermediate School 237) roofs, you could see his tags \\"CHY\\" on Main Street (Flushing, Queens). Chylow also was a good BMX biker, rocking \\"Miami hoppers\\" before anyone else on Colden Playground (Flushing, Queens). ==Career== ===Jam Master Jay=== Chyskillz started his music career deejaying for Large Professor, the founding member of Main Source. Chyskillz working on a recording studio as an engineer and producer on Neek The Exotic's project. One day he met Fredro Starr, who saw him playing deejaying. Fredro liked his beats, so he gave him his phone number. Onyx's manager, Jeff Harris, called him and invited him to Jam Master Jay's studio. When Chyskillz got with Jam Master Jay his first professional credit was the remix he did for Fam-Lee ‚Äì \\"Runs in the Fam-Lee\\". ===Onyx=== Queens, New York City M.C. Neek The Exotic introduced DJ Chyskillz to the group Onyx in 1991. In Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique Fredro described how Onyx met their new producer: > \\"...We met Chyskillz on Jamaica Avenue one day. We was buying weed at the > weed spot and Chy was chasing my truck down the street, yelling, 'I got > beats!' His stuff back then was jazzy, on some Tribe Called Quest shit, but > it was hot. I knew he could put beats together right away. We brought him > into our zone and made him do some grimy shit.\\" When Chyskillz met Fredro and Sticky they were already signed to Def Jam. The group was called Onyx and consisted of Fredro Starr, Sticky Fingaz, Suave (a.k.a. Sonny Seeza) and Big DS. When Chyskillz first got with Onyx, they already have another producer, but their stuff was a little bit more commercial and friendly. Chyskillz let Fredro hear some beats and it started from there. Chyskillz began making beats for Onyx and the collaboration just worked. The first song that Chyskillz ever did for Onyx was \\"Nigga Bridges\\". He did one song for them and Russell Simmons heard it and give Onyx an EP deal for 6 songs. But they did 10 songs on a budget of 6 songs, so Russell Simmons give them an album deal. Chyskillz and Jam Master Jay co-produced the hip-hop group Onyx's multi-platinum selling debut album called Bacdafucup. The album is described as having a \\"tense, wired edge that amplifies the vividness of the threatening lyrics. Sonically, it has a hardcore East Coast/New York City cast, full of throbbing bass and screeching siren-like effects\\". Chyskillz drew notice for his work on hit songs like \\"Throw Ya Gunz\\" and \\"Slam\\" by Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC. Onyx's hit song Slam, which Chyskillz co-produced with Jam Master Jay, was included in music writer Bruce Pollock's Rock Song Index: The 7500 Most Important Songs for the Rock and Roll Era. It also made the Billboard Hot 100. Chyskillz left Onyx in the summer of 1993 cause they don't need him like a producer record. So Chyskillz signed with Wasteland Records. In May 2003 Chyskillz founded his own label \\"719 Music Inc.\\". ==Musical style== In an interview with NPR, hip hop artist and record producer Large Professor described working with Chyskillz on one of his first demos: > \\"...that's the style of production that we were doing at that time, where he > would cut up \\"Synthetic Substitution\\" breakbeat on one tape. And you had the > two and three tape decks, and he would put the tape in there. And then he > would play that tape and overdub some bass lines.\\" ==Last Year== In the last year of his life, Chyskillz actively traveled by plane, now and then visiting the cities of Dallas (Texas), Atlanta (Georgia), New York and Miramar (Florida). In all the cities he had friends and there he found new clients ‚Äì rap artists, for whom he produced music. On the Facebook he uploaded videos he shot at the airport, marked \\"Where in the world is Chyskillz now\\" so that his friends would try to guess the city in which the producer is located, leaving comments under the post. And in the video he used to say: \\"It's about catch a flight, I'll might be in your city\\". ==Death== On July 5, 2017, Chyskillz was involved in a car accident and had surgery in October on his shoulder and was scheduled to possibly have back surgery soon. He was in a lot of pain and not working so much. He was in Queens, New York. On February 10, 2018 he was suffering a bad cold for two weeks and went to the hospital and they informed him that he had the flu, should never have gone to the studio and should have been resting. On February 12, Fredro and Sticky flew to New York. Fredro picked him up in Queens to go to the studio to do some remixing for the shows. Chyskillz was so pleased with this, he certainly agreed. After the session he came home late that evening around 2am. The next morning his family discovered him. Doctors say he suffered a heart attack. Next week he had to go to Miami, and then to Dallas for work. He just finished work on the project with De La Soul. ==Discography== ===Albums=== ;With Onyx * 1993: Bacdafucup ;Solo albums * 2014‚Äì2017: LP (unreleased) ===Production=== *1991: Fam-Lee ‚Äì \\"Runs in the Fam-Lee (It's The Fam-Lee Remix)\\" (from \\"Runs in the Fam-Lee (Vinyl Single)\\") ‚Äì Remixed by Jam Master Jay & Chy-Skills *1992: Fam-Lee ‚Äì \\"You're The One For Me (Hip-Hop Mix)\\" (from \\"You're The One For Me (Vinyl Single)\\") ‚Äì X-Tra Flavor by Chy Skills *1992: Public Enemy ‚Äì \\"Louder Than A Bomb (JMJ Telephone Tap Groove)\\" (from compilation album \\"Greatest Misses\\") ‚Äì Remixing *1992: Bo$$ ‚Äì \\"Livin' Loc'd\\" (from \\"Born Gangstaz\\") ‚Äì Producer *1992: Onyx ‚Äì \\"United States Ghetto (The U.S.G.)\\" ‚Äì Producer *1992: Onyx ‚Äì \\"Wake Up Dead, Nigga\\" (Throw Ya Gunz) (feat.

Capo's occupied an octagonal-shaped building located on a bay pier near 20 Bay Street across from Baya Lane throughout the Flagler Era. It appears in a sketch from 1875 that shows a wood building on a stone foundation across the street from the Old Spanish Prison and the residence of George H Emery. The facility provided hot and cold sea water, sulfur water baths, and shower baths \\"in the season.\\" Women and children bathed at separate times than men. Dressing rooms were provided to change from formal clothing to swim attire. In a 1934 interview with the Saint Augustine Record, Ocean View Hotel proprietor Henry E Hernandez described the Bath House: :\\"When asked about how tourists in the '80s amused themselves, Mr Hernandez told of the many ways in which they could pass their visit pleasantly. In those days the beaches were rather inaccessible but Capo's Bath House, located in front of where the Monson Hotel now stands, provided a place to swim right here in the city. A brick pool filled by the waters of the bay offered a sheltered, safe place for a swim and there were also private pools with hot water for those who didn't care to swim in the larger pools. There were dozens of sailboats for hire along the bay front and beach picnics and moonlight sails were favorite amusements.\\" The proprietor was Philip V Capo (1844-1901), who was a Saint Augustine native descended from Minorcan colonists. He served in the Confederate Army and returned to city after the war. It was managed for many years by Adolphus N Pacetty (1829-1913), who was also a Minorcan descendant and a Confederate veteran. Pacetty was the nephew of Antonia Paula Bonelly, and the husband of Amelia Monson, whose brother was the proprietor of Monson House. Capo's Bath House was destroyed in the 1914 fire that also ruined Genovar Opera House, Florida House, Hotel Clairmont, Monson House, and the Saint Johns County Court House. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in St. Johns County, Florida Category:St. Augustine, Florida Category:Public baths in the United States ","title":"Capo's bath house"},{"id":"56616647","text":"Bernat Jaume (born 19 November 1995 in Igualada) is a Spanish professional squash player.

Maimalari and his childhood friend, Lawan Umar joined the Royal West Africa Frontier Force in 1950. As part of a Nigerianization program to enlist more Nigerians into the senior ranks of army, he underwent preparatory course at the Regular Officers Training School, Teshie Ghana and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Both Maimalari and Lawan attended Sandhusrt but Lawan was later discharged from the army. Maimalari was the first Nigerian regular combatant commissioned into the officer Corps of the Nigerian army. He was an instructor at the Nigerian Military Training College and later commander of the second battalion Nigerian army. The intention to promote more Nigerian officers led to an organizational structure developed by regional and ethnic considerations. Maimalari was sometimes viewed by some Southern officers as a symbol of Northern domination due to his swift rise through the officer ranks from a regular combatant. The day prior to 15 January 1966 coup, Maimalari was celebrating his recent marriage, unknowingly some of the attendees were also rebel leaders who would come back to haunt him. On the day of the coup, as soon as rebel soldiers entered his compound, he escaped through the back of his house, at first hiding in a small quarters in his compound before exiting into the main road. On the road, he flagged a car hoping to go to Ikeja, but unfortunately, the car was a rebel car and he was captured and later killed. ==References== Category:1966 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:Barewa College alumni Category:Nigerian generals ","title":"Zakariya Maimalari"},{"id":"56616674","text":"Micah Franklin (born 2 September 1992) is a Bermudian professional squash player.

However, a change in their amino acid sequence renders SOBER1's biochemical properties into a deacetylase; in particular the hydrophobic tunnel, which is found in acyl-protein thioesterases, is impaired by additional amino acids in the lid structure of SOBER1, creating a new surface for binding of the acetyl group. 406x406px == Targets == So far, the following proteins have been identified as SOBER1 targets: AvrBsT; ACIP1. == See also == *Acylation *Catalytic triad *Compendium of protein lysine acetylation *Enzyme assay *Organic synthesis *Protein dynamics *Proteolysis *The Proteolysis Map == References == Category:Catalysis Category:Enzymes Category:Organic reactions Category:Post-translational modification ","title":"SOBER1"},{"id":"56616812","text":"Gerberding Hall (formerly known as the Administration Building) is a building on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, United States. ==History== The Administration Building was built in 1949 to house the University of Washington's administrative offices and was the first major structure erected on campus following World War II. Constructed from a design by Victor N. Jones and John T. Jacobsen, it was built at a cost of $1,561,924. In 1995, the Administration Building was renamed Gerberding Hall in honor of former university president William Gerberding. As of 2017, the building houses the office of the university's president. ==Design== The building's tower Located abutting Red Square, and constructed entirely of cast stone, Gerberding Hall is built in the collegiate Gothic style with its characteristic elements including gargoyles, pointed arches, towers, and gabled roofs. Along its parapets are 25 sculptures by Dudley Pratt representing different academic disciplines; for example, a figure of the god Neptune on the building's east gable is intended to represent oceanography and fisheries science. The structure is dominated by a central, square tower. On the face of each of its sides is engraved the keys of Phi Beta Kappa. The tower itself, originally intended to serve as a belfry, did not fulfill that purpose until 2008. In that year, a set of eight bells ‚Äì the Gordon Stuart Peek Foundation Memorial Bells ‚Äì was installed which were designed to be operated by change ringing. A shield bearing the visage of Herbert Condon in relief and the words \\"Friend of Youth\\" sits over the exterior doorway to the tower.

He was the son of the Emir of Mecca Muhsin ibn Husayn and a slave woman named Quwwat al-Nufus. In 1628 he accompanied his father to Yemen after the latter was forced to surrender the Emirate to Ahmad ibn Abd al-Muttalib. Muhsin died in Sanaa in 1629. Zayd remained in Yemen until 1631, when he returned to Mecca to serve as co-Emir with Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Hasan. ==Co-Emir of Mecca== On Friday, 1 Safar 1041 AH (29 August 1631), Abd Allah ibn Hasan (Zayd's great-uncle) handed over power to his son Muhammad and summoned Zayd from Yemen to be co-ruler. Zayd arrived at Mecca and took up his office in the second half of Safar (September 1631). Abd Allah continued to be mentioned alongside Muhammad and Zayd in the du‚Äòa until his death on Friday night, 10 Jumada II (1‚Äì2 January 1632). In Jumada I or Jumada II, Dilawar Agha arrived by sea to replace Mustafa Bey as governor of Jeddah. He also brought royal decrees and khil‚Äòahs (robes of honor) for the new Emirs of Mecca. Muhammad and Zayd were each invested with two khil‚Äòahs‚Äîthe first from the Sultan, and the second from the Vali of Egypt. ===Deposed by Nami ibn Abd al- Muttalib=== In early Sha'ban 1041 (February‚ÄìMarch 1632) news reached Mecca that an army of disaffected soldiers had left Yemen and was on its way to Mecca. After reaching Qunfudhah their commanders Kor Mahmud and Ali Bey sent word to Mecca that they wished to enter the holy city on their way to Egypt. Fearful of the disorder that the army would cause, Muhammad and Zayd denied them permission and despoiled the wells in the army's path. In retaliation the rebels allied with Nami ibn Abd al-Muttalib, a contender for the Emirate, and decided to enter the city by force. On Friday, 20 Sha'ban (12 March 1632), Muhammad and Zayd collected their forces and set out to intercept the advancing army. Mustafa Bey accompanied them with his own soldiers. They went to Birkat Majin, then to Qawz al-Makkasah, as they had received word that the army had reached al-Sa'diyah. At dawn on Wednesday, 25 Sha'ban (17 March 1632), the two sides met in battle near Wadi al-Biyar. After heavy fighting the Emirate's forces were defeated. Muhammad was killed along with several ashraf and two hundred of their army. The majority of the sanjak-bey's men were also killed. Zayd retreated with the surviving ashraf towards Wadi Marr al-Zahran while the rebels entered Mecca. Nami ibn Abd al-Muttalib was proclaimed Emir of Mecca, and he appointed his cousin Abd al-Aziz ibn Idris as his co-ruler. ==Return to the Emirate== After being deposed from the Emirate, Zayd went to Medina, and from there he and sent word of Mecca's capture to Halil Pasha, Vali of Egypt. In Shawwal 1041 the Vali dispatched 3500 soldiers to the Hejaz by land and sea. He sent ahead robes of investiture to Zayd with instructions to go to Yanbu to receive the army. On Tuesday, 4 Dhu al-Hijjah (22 June 1632), Nami and the rebels evacuated Mecca and barricaded themselves at the fortress of Turbah. Zayd and the Egyptian army entered Mecca without resistance at sunrise on 6 Dhu al-Hijjah (24 June 1632). ===Siege of Turbah=== After performing the Hajj, Zayd and the sanjak-beys went Turbah, where they besieged the fortress for around twenty days. On Friday night, 11 Muharram 1042 AH (29 July 1632), they entered the fortress and killed most of the rebels inside. They captured Kor Mahmud, Nami, and his brother Sayyid, and returned them to Mecca, where they were executed. ==Death== Zayd reigned uninterrupted until his death on Tuesday, 3 Muharram 1077 AH (6 July 1666). He was buried in al-Ma'lah in the qubba of Abu Talib ibn Hasan ibn Abi Numayy. After his death the Emirate was contested between his son Sa'd and his cousin Hammud ibn Abd Allah. ==Household== Zayd had five sons: * Sa'd: Born 1052 AH * Hasan * Ahmad: Born 1052 AH * Muhammad Yahya: Born 1049 AH * Husayn: Died before Zayd Among his personal slaves there was Bilal Agha, an Abyssinian who held a high position in his court, and Dhu al-Fiqar, a Turkic mamluk who had been with him for many years and whom he made commander of his army. ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Banu Qatadah Category:1607 births Category:1666 deaths Category:17th-century Arabs Category:Sharifs of Mecca Category:17th- century people of the Ottoman Empire Category:Arabs of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Zayd ibn Muhsin"},{"id":"56616956","text":"The disappearance of Azory Gwanda (born ca. 1975 ‚Äì disappeared November 21, 2017) is about a Tanzanian journalist for Mwananchi Communications Ltd in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who mysteriously disappeared in late 2017 from his home near Kibiti, Rufiji District, Pwani Region, Tanzania. == Personal == Azory Gwanda was 45 at the time of his disappearance. Gwanda had lived on a farm near Kibiti, Tanzania, with his wife Anna Pinoni. His mother, Eva Mpulumba from the Msimba Village in Kigoma Region, lived with the rest of his family, but has been the only relative to be interviewed regarding Gwanda's disappearance. == Career == While working at Mwananchi Communication Ltd as a journalist, Gwanda wrote a series of articles on a string of murders of local government officials and police officers by unidentified assailants on motorcycles. Gwanda was the first journalist to extensively cover these attacks. He wrote for Mwananchi Communications and its publications Mwananchi and The Citizen. He worked from the Kibiti Trading Centre, where he was last seen with unknown men. ==Disappearance== Gwanda has not been heard from since his disappearance in November 2017. He was last seen by his wife Ana Pinoni on their farm outside of Kibiti in a Toyota Land Cruiser with unknown men, claiming he was leaving on emergency business while also requesting that she hand over the keys to the house. After Gwanda's departure with the men, Pinoni returned to find the house ransacked, indicating it had been thoroughly searched. Previously, Gwanda had been approached by the strange men at his place of work. They had told him they wanted to speak with him and forced him into the car. Two hours later, Gwanda and the men arrived at his house in Kibiti. Initially, Gwanda's partner was not concerned about his sudden departure, but when he failed to return home or answer calls for two days she went to the local authorities. Mwananchi Communication Limited said it had no information as to where Gwanda had been taken, or why. Although there are small bits of information collected that illustrate the events leading up to the disappearance, no clear evidence has been gathered that may reveal where he is located. == Aftermath and reactions == While little is known about Gwanda's captors, it is assumed that they were tied to the people responsible for the string of murders he was reporting on. This particular criminal case had been ongoing for two years with nearly forty other people being murdered before Gwanda's disappearance. Gwanda's extensive coverage of these attacks may have made him a target. Gwanda was a key asset in understanding the intentions and overall information regarding the murders and as a result of his disappearance, unreported information has been lost. Gwanda's disappearance has concerned many organizations dedicated to promoting the rights of journalists around the world. Not even a month after the recorded incident, MISA Tanzania released a statement voicing their frustration with the lack of information surrounding Gwanda's condition, and calling attacks on journalists to be \\"...an attack on press freedom [that] must be condemned\\". Theophil Makunga, the chairman for the Tanzanian Editors Forum, asserted that \\"evil intentions\\" were present in the sudden disappearance of Gwanda. Mwigulu Nchemba, the Home Affairs minister in Tanzania, promised to speak with the heads of the police department about Gwanda. IFEX, another institution devoted to free expression, is concerned that Gwanda's disappearance \\"may discourage\\" the work of other journalists pursuing similar investigations. The news company that Gwanda had worked for, Mwananchi Communication Limited, also requested that these types of organizations, as well as the Tanzanian government, intensify the search for information. In September 2018 Gwanda received the Daudi Mwangosi Award for courage in journalism from the Union of Tanzania Press Club. In November 2018 two representatives of the Committee to Protect Journalists were detained in Tanzania while studying threats to journalists in the country, including Gwanda's disappearance. ==See also== *Politics of Tanzania *Human rights in Tanzania == References == Category:1975 births Category:Disappeared journalists Category:Tanzanian journalists Category:People from Kigoma Region Category:Living people ","title":"Disappearance of Azory Gwanda"},{"id":"56616958","text":"This is a list of years in Mauritania. ==20th century== ==21st century== ==See also== * History of Mauritania * Timeline of Nouakchott Category:Mauritania- related lists Mauritania ","title":"List of years in Mauritania"},{"id":"56616965","text":"Piattoli is a surname.

They were ordered in 1914 but, because of the First World War, deliveries did not begin until 1923. They were designed for alternating current at 12 kV, 16‚Öî Hz but, before construction, they were re-designed for direct current at 1,500 V. ==History== These locomotives were ordered from Constructions Electriques de France (CEF), Tarbes in 1914 following the decision to electrify the Midi network at 12 kV 16‚Öî Hz and to order six prototypes locomotives. Their delivery was delayed by the First World War and then by the government decision of 1920 to adopt 1,500 V direct current for new electrification schemes. It was not until 1923 that the first two prototypes began their tests. The original livery was blue. ==Technical details== The machines were initially designed with three Westinghouse motors arranged horizontally but were re-designed with 1,500 V Dick Kerr motors arranged vertically and, presumably, driving through bevel gears. It is unclear whether there were three or six 1,500 V motors. If there were only three, it is likely that they would have had double armatures to allow series- parallel operation. ==Career== They were the first French electric locomotives designed to reach, and even exceed, 120 km / h. For a time, they held the global blue ribbon for speed with an average of 108 km / h on the Bordeaux - Bayonne route. Later, with the increase in train weight, following the arrival of metal carriages, they were seen as underpowered and were replaced by the 2D2 locomotives of the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (PO). ==Scale models== The 2C2 3100 was reproduced in HO scale by the British manufacturer DJH / Model Loco, as a kit (white metal and brass) to be assembled and painted. ==References== ==Further reading== * Luc Fournier, \\"Les 2C2 E3100 du Midi, anc√™tres du TGV\\", article de la revue Rails d'Autrefois n¬∞5, avril 2012 Category:2-Co-2 locomotives Category:Standard gauge electric locomotives of France Category:1500 V DC locomotives Category:Chemins de fer du Midi Category:2‚Ä≤Co2‚Ä≤ locomotives ","title":"2C2 3100"},{"id":"56617013","text":"Phintella caledoniensis is a jumping spider species in the genus Phintella that was first identified in 2009.

In 1915, owner William J. Olson signed a contract with Harvey A. Craig to lease the Orpheum and provide its management, upon the completion of the theatre. At the time, Olson also owned the Gaiety Theatre on the corner of Cherry and Simmons Street. Olson wanted the Orpheum to outclass its competitors, attracting the most popular acts and fashionable audiences. In order to accomplish this purpose, Craig and Olson toured the Midwest viewing other theaters. C.W. and George L. Rapp of Chicago were hired to build the Orpheum. Rapp and Rapp owned one of the largest architectural firms in the United States, specializing in building theaters: Chicago, Pittsburgh, Manhattan, and New Jersey. The Rapps believed that ‚Äúshowplaces should have all the trappings of the rich, but be accessible to all.‚Äù Early in 1915, Craig and Olson took sub-bids for work on the Orpheum.

Pearlman and Company won the contract for light fixtures, Murphy Brothers got the hardware contract, and Mandel Brothers were the decorators. ‚ÄúThe Orpheum Files.‚Äù The design of the Orpheum was a blend of ‚ÄúItalian Renaissance and Second Empire Style of the 19th Century France with flourishes of classical, baroque, and art nouveau.‚Äù The lobby boasted a crystal chandelier and French-mirror windows. Iconic columns and French windows done by an Italian craftsman, added to the Orpheum's elegance. The theatre's main floor seated 550 patrons, the balcony 500, and 15 boxes on the mezzanine level. The seats and carpet were old rose with trimmings in ivory. The Orpheum was built to be fire resistant, including fireproof curtains and chairs. The theatre was considered modern in its acoustics, stage construction, ventilation system, and dressing rooms equipped with running water.Unidentifiable newspaper article from 1916 ‚ÄúOrpheum Files.‚Äù Several delays occurred in the building process. Project manager Henry Duvall took sick, Mandel Brothers had to touch-up the decoration, the insurance inspector was delayed in publishing a rate, a contractor was postponed in laying cement, no temporary heat was available for the theatre, and a hundred chairs from the American Seating Company were damaged in transport. Although originally planned to open April 3, delays pushed the theatre opening into August.Orpheum Files == Early History == On August 21, 1916, the theatre opened in ‚Äúa blaze of glory.‚Äù Tickets sold out early and some 1,300 theatergoers attended. The first program consisted of five vaudeville acts, two reels of motion pictures, preceded by introductory speeches by William J. Olson and Illinois Supreme Court Justice C.C. Craig. One opening night patron called the Orpheum ‚Äúthe finest house of its size in the whole United States.\\" During its early history, the Orpheum primarily featured vaudeville, the most popular form of theater entertainment throughout the early 20th century, ‚Äúa series of short variety acts\\" with actors, dancers, jugglers, musicians, and magicians. As in the circus, these performers traveled from city to city on the Orpheum circuit. Galesburg's Orpheum Theatre operated on the Orpheum Circuit, and hosted many famous vaudeville stars during its heyday‚ÄîHoudini, George Burns, Jack Benny, Al Jolson, and the Marx brothers. Vaudeville reached the height of its popularity in 1928 when there were more than 1000 vaudeville theaters in the United States. By this time, short films had become part of the vaudeville programs, and were slowly gaining popularity. Vaudeville declined during the 1930s with the growth of both radio and the movies. Cinemas were cheaper than vaudeville, because live performances were more expensive to produce. The Orpheum Theatre like other vaudeville theaters declined and was sold to the Great States Theaters in 1935. 1 In order to become a cinema, the theatre underwent renovations: the French windows and bass work were removed, box seats in the mezzanine replaced, and the crystal chandelier was replaced. In 1940, the theatre hosted the premiere of ‚ÄúThose Were the Days (at Good Old Siwash),‚Äù a film based on a series of popular short stories by George Helgesen Fitch. Fitch had written the stories, originally published in the Saturday Evening Post, about a fictional college based on the real-life Knox College. The film was largely shot on location in Galesburg, and featured some three hundred Knox students as extras along with William Holden, Ezra Stone, and Judy Barrett. The Orpheum continued showing films through the 1980s. In 1974, Kerasotes Theaters leased the Orpheum from the Great States Theater of Chicago, and in 1978, bought the building. Under Kerasotes management the Orpheum showed first-run films. On November 18, 1982 the Orpheum Theatre closed: due to the rise of malls containing cinemas with multiple screens, the inability to screen more than one film at a time, and limited parking space. The Orpheum was expensive: new paint, carpets, and an air conditioner cost Kerasotes Theaters over $70,000. After Kerasotes closed the Orpheum, the theatre stood empty. == Modern History == In August 1983, the Knox County Board voted to form a Civic Center Committee to raise funds for the restoration and remodeling of the theatre. In December of the following year, Kerasotes Theaters deeded the Orpheum to the Committee. The transaction involved no money, but required the Orpheum not to show first-run films that might compete with Kerasotes business. The Players presented their money to the Orpheum Theater Project Committee, which directed the details of the renovation. A portion of this money was used to determine whether the community could support the theatre. The Committee also investigated the cost of renovations, a study necessary before applying for state grants. The Committee made efforts to raise money for the renovation locally, then applied to the state of Illinois in July 1984, for a $2 million grant from the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA). Governor James Thompson signed the bill for $19 million in bonds toward state projects. Then, the state legislature debated about giving money to the Orpheum. In February 1985, a grant was awarded to the Orpheum, but the project had to wait an additional eleven months before the funds became available. Originally, the DCCA planned to sell bonds immediately, but delays abounded. Debt service on the Orpheum bonds was supposed to be paid from a tax on pari-mutual betting at the Illinois race tracks, but on August 1, 1984 the Arlington Park Race Track burned down, eliminating this source of revenue. The fire, a decline in statewide betting, and a tax break given to race track owners by Illinois Legislature, left the DCCA with insufficient security and forced it to pay higher interest on bonds sold before 1985. Afraid that its bond rating would be too low, the DCCA chose to wait until December 1985 to sell the bonds. Once the bonds were sold, the Authority had to reach an agreement with the State for the funds. The original agreement entitled the Authority to receive all $2 million, but the state reworded the agreement to withhold $200,000. The Authority had orinigally planned to earn $100,000 from interest on the grant, but the Illinois Grant Recovery Act required the interest be returned to the state. At one point the Authority considered ligation to force the state to pay interest, but attorneys decided that a court battle could take years and would further delay the grant. On April 11, 1986, a check for $1.8 million arrived in Galesburg. The agreement stated that the Authority would invest the money and on the completion of the renovation, the DCCA would either take the excess interest or pay the difference to equal the promised $2 million if the Authority earned less. Because of these delays, the Committee faced new problems: the boiler went out, a pipe in the theatre burst, its funds dwindled to $3,000, and the cost of construction increased five percent. Rolland Killian, the project architect, had originally expected to start work on the theatre seventeen months earlier. Because the cost of materials had risen, plans for the renovation were revised to accommodate higher prices and the missing $200,000. New plans called for a contingency fund in case something else went wrong, and budgeted for movie projection equipment and a $22,000 dollar grand piano. As the project got underway a dispute arose between the Orpheum Theatre Management Committee and the Knox County Civic Center (KCCC). The Committee's job was to handle theatre operations, but they did so under the authority of the KCCC, with no power to make independent decisions. This restriction hindered the Committee's ability to book acts for the theatre. The Committee drew up a new constitution and by-laws enabling it to exercise greater power to make decisions. The KCCC attorney rewrote the Committee's constitution, which continued its subordination to the KCCC and required KCCC's approval for all expenses over $2,500. Finally, after negotiations, the KCCC and Committee agreed to work together on a new constitution. As the plans for the renovations were finalized, a dispute broke out about the Critic's Square, a concession area. The KCCC planned for a concession area on the mezzanine level, as well as for a marquee and new doors. Because construction costs rose, the theatre had to scale back the renovations. A compromise dropped the marquee and doors but kept the Critic's Square. Another difficulty was the location of the concession area on the mezzanine level, inaccessible to handicapped and arguably in violation of the Environmental Barriers Act of September 1985.Newspaper Article, ‚ÄúOrpheum Files.‚Äù The KCCC argued its plans for the concession fell under an earlier law.9 Anna Sophia Johnson Memo, ‚ÄúThe Orpheum Files.‚Äù Newspaper Article, ‚ÄúOrpheum Files.‚Äù Anna Sophia Johnson was a local from Wataga, Illinois. Johnson compiled a memo that called for the Critic‚Äôs Square concession on the main floor in the lobby. Otherwise, the theatre would require an elevator. Johnson stated that the purpose of the Critic‚Äôs Square was to provide a small meeting room for receptions, art shows, and meetings, a room that could be rented out to the public. Johnson then sent out letters to the DCCA, Capital Development Board, and the Attorney General‚Äôs office asking if the plans for the Critic‚Äôs Square complied with state law. Newspaper Article, ‚ÄúOrpheum Files.‚Äù A state review decided the Environmental Barriers Act did, in fact, apply to the theatre: the Critic's Square must be handicapped accessible, thru an elevator or a lift.Letter, \\"Orpheum Files.\\" Instead, the KCCC scrapped plans for Critic's Square on the mezzanine level and placed it in the lobby. With this dispute settled, renovations moved forward. In 1988, the Committee began to plan for opening night. The opening had been moved back several times, before the Committee decided on the weekend of May 6‚Äì8, 1988. The Committee selected the Henry Mancini Orchestra as the opening night performance along with other events including the showing of Around the World in 80 Days and a cocktail party. On May 5, 1988 theatre doors opened for the first time in over 5 years, the Henry Mancini Orchestra played to a sold-out crowd of 970. Mancini dubbed the theatre a ‚ÄúLittle Jewel box.‚Äù Orpheum launched the Red Carpet series to bring world class acts into the theatre, but in the fall of 2009, the theatre was forced to cancel the series due to high production costs and low ticket sales. But the series was reinstated in 2010 and the Theatre and its Red Carpet Series continued to thrive. Funding for the theatre was a major problem. In 2000, the City of Galesburg gave the Orpheum 2% of the city's Hotel and Motel tax funds, up to $100,000 per year. In 2006, the Orpheum was awarded 501(c)3 non-profit status. In 2009, the KCCC considered scaling back theatre operations because of the lack of money. Ticket sales were down, repairs were required, the boiler needed to be replaced, State funds for the theatre were slashed, and the city's Hotel and Motel tax was producing less revenue.‚ÄúOrpheum face uncertain future,‚Äù Register Mail, 2 August 2009. The KCCC considered turning the theatre into a rental-only facility, but decided to look into other options first. The Orpheum applied to the Save America‚Äôs Treasures for a $500,000 grant which required a $500,000 in matching funds for the grant. The Orpheum applied to the City of Galesburg for $100,000 in Tax Increment Financing and was awarded a $100,000 federal appropriations recommended by Senator Dick Durbin. Sequestration ended any discretionary funding but the Orpheum still managed to raise additional funds and pledges totaling over $512,000to begin repairs to the aging HVAC and lighting systems. The city pledged $50,000 to the Orpheum contingent upon the Orpheum receiving the grant. The Orpheum raised another $200,000 from local organizations and private donations. If given the grant, the Orpheum would have the funds to replace the heating and cooling systems and make improvements to the interior and exterior of the theatre. ‚ÄúCounty commits $50,000 to Orpheum,‚Äù Register Mail, 29 October 2009. According to a December 2010 article, the Orpheum was posting a $141,000+ profit and attendance exceeded its goal. In 2016 the Orpheum celebrated 100 years. Today the theatre operates Youth Entertainment Series (YES) a free introduction to theater for area students.

This helps describe precisely the structure, layout and position of an object, and minimises ambiguity. An internationally accepted lexicon is Terminologia Histologica. ==Layout== Histological section taken from the gastric antrum, showing the stomach wall. The lumen of the stomach is the upper empty portion, and is surrounded by a single layer of columnar cells, called simple columnar epithelium. ===Epithelia and endothelia=== Epithelial cells line body surfaces, and are described according to their shape, with three principal shapes: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal. * Squamous epithelium has cells that are wider than their height (flat and scale-like). * Cuboidal epithelium has cells whose height and width are approximately the same (cube shaped). * Columnar epithelium has cells taller than they are wide (column-shaped). Endothelium refers to cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, forming an interface between circulating blood or lymph in the lumen and the rest of the vessel wall. It is a thin layer of simple, or single-layered, squamous cells called endothelial cells. Endothelial cells in direct contact with blood are called vascular endothelial cells, whereas those in direct contact with lymph are known as lymphatic endothelial cells. Epithelium can be arranged in a single layer of cells described as \\"simple\\", or more than one layer, described as \\"stratified\\". By layer, epithelium is classed as either simple epithelium, only one cell thick (unilayered) or stratified epithelium as stratified squamous epithelium, stratified cuboidal epithelium, and stratified columnar epithelium that are two or more cells thick (multi-layered),van Lommel, 2002: p. 97van Lommel, 2002: p. 94 and both types of layering can be made up of any of the cell shapes. However, when taller simple columnar epithelial cells are viewed in cross section showing several nuclei appearing at different heights, they can be confused with stratified epithelia. This kind of epithelium is therefore described as pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Transitional epithelium has cells that can change from squamous to cuboidal, depending on the amount of tension on the epithelium. ===Mucosa=== A mucous membrane or mucosa is a membrane that lines various cavities in the body and covers the surface of internal organs. It consists of one or more layers of epithelial cells overlying a layer of loose connective tissue. It is mostly of endodermal origin and is continuous with the skin at various body openings such as the eyes, ears, inside the nose, inside the mouth, lip, the urethral opening and the anus. Some mucous membranes secrete mucus, a thick protective fluid. The function of the membrane is to stop pathogens and dirt from entering the body and to prevent bodily tissues from becoming dehydrated. ===Submucosal and muscular layers=== The submucosa consists of a dense and irregular layer of connective tissue with blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscular layer. It contains the submucous plexus, and enteric nervous plexus, situated on the inner surface of the muscular layer. The muscular layer (also known as the muscularis propria ) consists of two layers of muscle, the inner and outer layer. The muscle of the inner layer is arranged in circular rings around the tract, whereas the muscle of the outer layer is arranged longitudinally. The stomach has an extra layer, an inner oblique muscular layer. Between the two muscle layers are the myenteric or Auerbach's plexus. This controls peristalsis. Activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells (interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can of course be modulated by the rest of the autonomic nervous system. The layers are not truly longitudinal or circular, rather the layers of muscle are helical with different pitches. The inner circular is helical with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is helical with a much shallower pitch. ===Serosa and adventitia=== * Serosa (if the tissue is intraperitoneal) / Adventitia (if the tissue is retroperitoneal) -- these last two tissue types differ slightly in form and function according to the part of the gastrointestinal tract they belong to. ==Position on the cell membrane== The hollow inner part of a body organ (such as the gastrointestinal tract) or tube (such as an artery) is called the lumen.

He is most known for being Sammy Davis Jr.'s long-time music director, arranger, and conductor. Rhodes made history as a black music director by being the first to work for a major network (at NBC in 1966 for The Sammy Davis Jr. Show) and to work for a Las Vegas showroom (at the Tropicana Hotel in 1973). After being hired as a temporary pianist for Davis in 1955, Rhodes eventually became his principal arranger and conductor, working on his variety act, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, three of Davis' television specials, two musicals starring Davis, and three albums. ==Biography== ===Early life=== George Arthur Rhodes was born in Indiana on October 10, 1918 to Margaret and James Rhodes.\\"George Arthur Rhodes, Cart√µ de Imigra√ß√£o; 1954.\\" April 28, 1954. Cart√µes de imigra√ß√£o, Caixa 332, Ma√ßo 3, Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, registos de migra√ß√£o (parte 5), 1930-1970. Arquivo Nacional, Rio de Janeiro (National Archives, Rio de Janeiro), digitized by the Genealogical Society of Utah, 2011 accessed via FamilySearch February 18, 2018. However, he moved to Chicago, Illinois and it is often named as his hometown. ===Career=== Rhodes began his career in Chicago as a pianist for the blues singer Lil Green in 1944. He continued to play piano for other black artists, such as the jazz musicians Red Allen, J. C. Higginbotham, and Arnett Cobb. While playing in Cobb's band, Rhodes moved to New York, where he was a piano student at the Juilliard School. While in New York City in the 1950s, he started his work as an arranger for a string of record labels: Apollo Records (from 1950 to 1952), RCA Victor (1954 to 1955), and King Records (from 1955 to 1956). Rhodes also continued playing piano with jazz musicians such as Jonah Jones. In 1955 Sammy Davis Jr., while in New York to star in the musical Mr. Wonderful, hired Rhodes as pianist in the band of his variety act, the Will Mastin Trio, which was then led by arranger, conductor, and pianist himself Morty Stevens. As Stevens began gaining independent success as a composer, Rhodes took over more responsibility as bandleader, eventually replacing Stevens as principal arranger and conductor when he left the act to work for CBS. Rhodes would continue working for Davis for 30 years, until his death in 1985. In addition to their strong professional relationship, Rhodes also quickly became a good friend of Davis and they remained close for the rest of his life. In the 1960s, Rhodes served as music director for many of Sammy Davis Jr.'s projects. In 1965, he returned to Broadway with Davis as conductor for the musical Golden Boy, for which Davis was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Rhodes became the first black music director to work for a major television network when he was conductor-arranger of The Sammy Davis Jr. Show for NBC in 1966. In the same year, he also was music director for \\"The Swinging World of Sammy Davis Jr.,\\" a television variety special which was nominated for the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special. Rhodes again broke barriers in 1973 by becoming the first black music director of a Las Vegas showroom when he was hired by the Tropicana Hotel. This was precipitated by Sammy Davis Jr. becoming a director of the hotel (the first black director of a Las Vegas casino), at which he would also be performing. In 1978, Rhodes was set to conduct the orchestra during Davis' return to Broadway in the revival of Stop the World - I Want to Get Off as he had for Golden Boy, but was dismissed during previews in San Diego. It was reported that the producers had agreed to Davis' request for Rhodes to conduct only to placate him, but did not think Rhodes would be up to the job and instead wanted to use Ian Fraser, the arranger and music supervisor of the original 1961 production. However, upon finding out, Davis refused to continue in the production until he was reinstated, saying later \\"I told them I couldn't perform. It's like losing my family.\\" The production team were forced to re-sign Rhodes as conductor/music director for the three week Broadway run. ===Personal life=== In 1958, Rhodes married Shirley Anne Vest, who became a manager for Sammy Davis Jr..\\"Shirley Anne Vest and George Rhodes, 01 Jun 1958\\" Nevada Marriage Index, 1956-2005 database, Nevada, United States, County Book, p. D09, Nevada State Health Division, Carson City, and Clark County Marriage Bureau, Las Vegas. Accessed via FamilySearch They remained married until his death in 1985, and she described him as \\"a good, kind, gentle man.\\" The couple had five children: George Jr., Shirley, Andrea, Gregory, and Eygie. He had a strong lifelong friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. who often referred to him as family. In response to his passing, Davis said \\"He was my brother on and off the stage, and no one can ever replace him in either area of my life.\\" ===Death=== At the age of 67\\"George Rhodes, Dec 1985\\" United States Social Security Death Index U.S. Social Security Administration, Death Master File, accessed via FamilySearch Rhodes died of a heart attack in his sleep at his Los Angeles home early in the morning of December 25, 1985.

Comet jetliner registered G-ALYV and operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation, broke up mid-air and crashed after encountering a severe squall, shortly after taking off from Calcutta (now Kolkata), India. All 43 passengers and crew on board were killed. The crash was followed in less than a year by two more fatal accidents involving structural failure of Comet aircraft: BOAC Flight 781 and South African Airways Flight 201, after which the entire fleet was grounded until extensive redesign of the type was carried out, leading to the development of the Comet 2 version. == History of the flight == Flight 783 had originated in Singapore and was a service to London. After a scheduled stopover at Calcutta's Dum Dum Airport (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport), the aircraft departed on 2 May at 16:29 local time (10:59 GMT) on its next segment to Delhi. Six minutes after takeoff, while the jet was climbing to , radio contact with air traffic control was lost. At around the same time, witnesses on the ground near the village of Jagalgori, around north-west of Calcutta, observed the aircraft coming down in flames. Severe rain and thunderstorms were present in the area. The wreckage of G-ALYV was later found strewn along a track, with the main parts still on fire. There were no survivors. == Victims == The 43 people on board were 6 crew members and 37 passengers of British, American, Australian, Burmese and Filipino nationalities. Among the victims were Australian politician Trevor Oldham and his wife. == Investigation == The subsequent investigation found that, after encountering a squall, the aircraft \\"suffered structural failure in the air which caused fire.\\" The probable cause of the failure was reported as \\"overstressing which resulted from either: severe gusts encountered in the thundersquall, or overcontrolling or loss of control by the pilot when flying through the thunderstorm.\\" The investigators also recommended \\"to consider if any modification to the structure of the Comet is necessary.\\" == References == Category:Accidents and incidents involving the de Havilland Comet Flight 783 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by in-flight structural failure Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in India Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1953 Category:1953 in India ","title":"BOAC Flight 783"},{"id":"56617531","text":"What Price Decency is a 1933 American drama film directed by Arthur Gregor and starring Dorothy Burgess, Alan Hale and Walter Byron.

Fernando is also about to marry the woman of his life. On the other hand, his two cousins Mat√≠as (Alfonso Dosal) ‚Äî a former pop star ‚Äî and Dante (Martin Altomaro), a man trying to finish an infinite thesis that lives in the closet of his mother's house, are the complete opposite of our protagonist. The papers are reversed when Viviana (Marcela Guirado), Fernando's girlfriend, confesses through Whatsapp that she has cheated on him, a message that arrives at the least opportune moment. Fernando loses the control he has maintained all his life, stealing the plume and throwing himself in an insane revenge, which can cost him the skin, his poor cousins who go behind trying to save him, and in passing, the plume of Moctezuma to a country that has been waiting 500 years for his return. == Cast == * Osvaldo Benavides as Fernando * Marcela Guirado as Viviana * Martin Altomaro as Dante * Alfonso Dosal as Mat√≠as * Sebasti√°n Zurita as Masiosare * Marianna Burelli as Duva * Paula Serrano as Carmen == References == == External links == * Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican comedy films Category:2018 comedy films ","title":"Todo mal"},{"id":"56617643","text":"Bogdan Volodimirovich Savenko (; born 20 November 1974), is a Ukrainian retired professional ice hockey player.

As a high school senior she survived the February 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, and in response co-founded the gun-control advocacy group Never Again MSD. Gonz√°lez gave a viral speech against gun violence, proclaiming \\"We call B.S.\\" on the lack of action by politicians funded by the NRA. Subsequently, Gonz√°lez continued to be an outspoken activist on gun control, making high-profile media appearances and helping organize the March for Our Lives. Speaking at the demonstration, Gonz√°lez led a moment of silence for the victims of the massacre; she stood on stage for six minutes, which she observed was the length of the shooting spree itself. Gonz√°lez was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018. == Early life and education == Gonz√°lez was raised in Parkland, Florida; a suburb of the Miami metropolitan area. Her mother is a math tutor and her father is a cybersecurity attorney who immigrated from Cuba to New York City in 1968. She has two older siblings. Gonz√°lez graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the spring of 2018. She served as the president of its gay‚Äìstraight alliance. In high school, Gonz√°lez was also the tracking team leader on Project Aquila, a mission to send a school-made weather balloon \\"to the edge of space\\"; the project was documented by fellow student David Hogg. She enjoys creative writing and astronomy but not mathematics. On the day of the shooting, she was in the auditorium with dozens of other students when the fire alarm went off. She attempted to exit through the hallway, but was told to take cover and took refuge back in the auditorium, where she was held for two hours until police let students out. She is currently studying at New College of Florida. == Advocacy == === \\"We Call B.S.\\" speech at the Rally to Support Firearm Safety Legislation === Gonz√°lez speaks at the Rally to Support Firearm Safety Legislation in Fort Lauderdale, February 17, 2018. Gonz√°lez and David Hogg attend the Rally to Support Firearm Safety Legislation in Fort Lauderdale on February 17, 2018. On February 17, 2018, Gonz√°lez gave an 11-minute speech in front of the Broward County Courthouse at a gun control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The speech was in reaction to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, three days previously, during which a gunman had killed 17 and severely injured many more. In the speech she pledged to work with her peers to pressure lawmakers to change the law. \\"We are going to be the last mass shooting,\\" Gonz√°lez proclaimed. \\"That's going to be Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook, and it's all going to be due to the tireless efforts of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most importantly the students.\\" The speech notably featured a call and response: \\"We call B.S.,\\" in response to gun laws, calling for advocacy and empowering young people to speak out against school shootings. The speech then went viral. According to The Washington Post, Gonz√°lez's speech became emblematic of the \\"new strain of furious advocacy\\" that sprang up immediately after the shooting. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Gonz√°lez said she felt her message would resonate through repetition. \\"I knew I would get my job done properly at that rally if I got people chanting something. And I thought 'We call B.S.' has four syllables, that's good, I'll use that. I didn't want to say the actual curse words... this message doesn't need to be thought of in a negative way at all.\\" A recording of Gonz√°lez delivering a line in the speech was sampled as the intro for Madonna's \\"I Rise\\", released in May 2019. === Subsequent activism and media appearances === She and other survivors spoke with Florida state legislators in Tallahassee on February 20, 2018. The students watched the legislature vote down debate on an existing gun control bill. The students also spoke at an internationally televised town hall hosted by CNN on February 21, 2018. Gonz√°lez and others criticized the National Rifle Association (NRA) as well as politicians who accept money from it, as being complicit in the shootings, and stated that \\"you're either funding the killers, or you're standing with the children.\\" At the town hall, Gonz√°lez pressed an NRA representative to clarify her position on guns. \\"Dana Loesch, I want you to know that we will support your two children in the way that you will not,\\" Gonz√°lez said at the town hall. \\"The shooter at our school obtained weapons that he used on us legally. Do you believe that it should be harder to obtain the semi-automatic and... the modifications for these weapons to make them fully automatic like bump stocks?\\" Loesch answered Gonz√°lez by arguing that mentally ill people shouldn't have access to weapons. Gonz√°lez interjected and noted that she hadn't answered her question. \\"I think I'm gonna interrupt you real quick and remind you that the question is actually, do you believe it should be harder to obtain these semi-automatic weapons and modifications to make them fully automatic, such as bump stocks?\\" Shortly after her viral speech and high-profile media appearances, Gonz√°lez joined Twitter and acquired more than 1 million followers within a span of less than ten days. Gonz√°lez continued to speak out against gun violence. Glamour Magazine called Gonz√°lez \\"the face of the #NeverAgain movement\\" and \\"a recognizable icon\\" while The Washington Post called her \\"La nueva cara of Florida Latinx\\" (\\"The new face of Florida Latinx\\") and drew comparisons to the revolutionary Jos√© Mart√≠. NBC News called her \\"one of the most visible student activists to emerge from the shooting...\\" In a nationally televised interview on 60 Minutes, Gonz√°lez described the idea of arming teachers in classrooms with guns as \\"stupid.\\" In March 2018, Gonz√°lez was on the cover of Time magazine along with fellow activists Jaclyn Corin, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky, and Alex Wind.Associated Press, March 22, 2018, Houston Public Media, Parkland Students On Cover Of Time Magazine. Retrieved March 22, 2018, Note: cover third week March 2018; \\"...The cover features Marjory Stoneman Douglas students Jaclyn Corin, Alex Wind, Emma Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky and David Hogg,....\\" That same month she was profiled by France 24. Protesters react as Gonz√°lez remains silent as part of her speech at the March for Our Lives on March 24, 2018. === Speech at March for Our Lives === Gonz√°lez and other students, including fellow Parkland survivors Hogg, Kasky, and Sarah Chadwick, organized and participated in the nationwide March for Our Lives protest on March 24, 2018, with a focus on speakers and a march in Washington, DC. Gonz√°lez spoke for six minutes, the length of time of the Parkland shooting, and paid tribute to the victims by mentioning each one by name and giving examples of things they would never again be able to do. She followed this by several minutes of silence. Gonz√°lez was interviewed on MSNBC at the march, stating people needed to \\"empathize rather than feel apathy\\" and calling for young people to register to vote. === New laws === In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raises the minimum age for buying firearms to 21, establishes waiting periods and background checks, provides a program for the arming of some teachers and the hiring of school police, bans bump stocks, and bars potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, the law allocates around $400 million for implementation. Rick Scott signed the bill into law on March 9. The governor commented, \\"To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn't let up and you fought until there was change.\\" === Continuing advocacy === In May 2018 Gonz√°lez met with James Shaw Jr., a man who prevented further bloodshed at a mass shooting in a Waffle House restaurant by rushing the attacker and taking away his AR-15 rifle and saving more lives; both Shaw and Gonz√°lez described each other as heroes.Terence Cullen, May 13, 2018, New York Daily News, Waffle House hero James Shaw Jr. meets with Parkland shooting survivors. Retrieved May 13, 2018, \\"... Shaw posted a photo of himself with Gonzalez on Saturday, saying he \\"met one of my heros today.\\" ... == Attacks and conspiracy theories == Gonz√°lez was attacked for her Fort Lauderdale speech by many from the political right wing of American politics and press. She has also faced derogatory comments made by internet trolls about her sexual orientation, short hair, and skin color. She was verbally attacked by Leslie Gibson, then the Republican candidate running unopposed for the Maine legislature and lifetime NRA member, who referred to her as a \\"skinhead lesbian\\", whereupon 28-year-old Eryn Gilchrist filed papers to run against him, thus providing an opponent; Republican former state Senator Thomas Martin, Jr., who said that Gibson's remarks did not represent the Maine Republican Party, and that he planned to contact the survivors to commend their courage, also filed to run for the seat. A few days later Gibson himself dropped out of the race. Gonz√°lez was the target of many right-wing conspiracy theories and hoaxes since the shooting. Conspiracy theorists have falsely accused the students, including Gonz√°lez, of being crisis actors. Benjamin Kelly, an aide to Florida state Representative Shawn Harrison, was fired after making such accusations. Donald Trump Jr. faced criticism for appearing to support the crisis actor accusations. The conspiracy theories spread about Gonz√°lez and other Parkland survivors were named PolitiFact's 2018 Lie of the Year. Following her highly publicized speech at the March for Our Lives, pro-gun activists doctored fake photos and video showing Gonz√°lez ripping up a copy of the United States Constitution, spreading them widely on internet forums and social media. Snopes.com observed that the video was in fact a digitally manipulated Teen Vogue video of her tearing up shooting range targets. Adam Baldwin defended spreading the fake video, saying it was \\"political satire.\\" === Attacks by Steve King and response === Republican congressman Steve King attacked Gonz√°lez for wearing a Cuban flag patch on her jacket during her speech, saying in a post on Facebook, \\"This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don't speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense.\\" The Cuban flag worn by Gonz√°lez was adopted in 1902, fifty years before the communist take over, and has been used by anti-Castro Cuban exiles as a symbol of patriotism. One of the survivors of the Orlando nightclub shooting, Brandon Wolf, responded to King saying \\"When it was my community, where were you? When it was Sandy Hook? Columbine? Were you on the sideline mocking those communities too? Did you question someone identifying as a mother? Did you question whether people like me were crisis actors?\\" and \\"Emma stood for 6 mins and 20 seconds to honor the lives of 17 gone too soon. The least you could do is shut your privileged, ineffective trap for 6 seconds to hear someone else's perspective.\\" In an interview with the New Civil Rights Movement, Wolf also pointed out that King keeps a Confederate flag on his desk. King's comments generated fierce condemnation from Wolf, Gonz√°lez, and other members of Never Again MSD. In June 2018, as part of the March for Our Lives' \\"Road to Change\\" tour, gun control advocates and members of Never Again MSD arrived at King's office in Sioux City to protest against King. Protesters and gun control advocates berated King for his history of racially charged statements and attacks; Gonz√°lez personally denounced King and accused him of racism. King largely ignored the protests. == Personal life == Gonz√°lez identifies as bisexual. According to Vogue, her buzz cut is not a reaction to the school shooting, but rather to Florida's climate. \\"People asked me, 'Are you taking a feminist stand?' No, I wasn't. It's Florida. Hair is just an extra sweater I'm forced to wear,\\" Gonz√°lez recalled. \\"I even made a PowerPoint presentation to convince my parents to let me shave my head, and it worked.\\" == Works == * * * == References == == External links == * * * Florida student to NRA and Trump: 'We call BS' CNN video of 11-minute speech on YouTube * On arming teachers 60 Minutes video * CBS News Interview with Gonz√°lez and Hogg Category:1999 births Category:Activists from Florida Category:American women activists Category:American gun control activists Category:American people of Cuban descent Category:American shooting survivors Category:Bisexual women Category:LGBT Hispanic and Latino American people Category:LGBT people from Florida Category:Living people Category:People from Parkland, Florida Category:Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Category:Youth activists Category:21st-century American women Category:New College of Florida alumni Category:Gun politics in the United States Category:Progressivism in the United States ","title":"Emma Gonz√°lez"},{"id":"56617741","text":"The Continental Oil Company building complex is a significant component of railroad-related economic activity in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

The northern part of the lake is crossed to the West by the Broadback River. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second with an upstream navigable waterbody including the Broadback River and the Nipukatasi River. The southern part of the Salamandre Lake hydrographic slope is accessible via a forest road (east‚Äìwest) coming from the west and connecting the main road going north. The surface of Salamandre Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May; however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April. == Geography == The Salamandre Lake is part of a group of lakes in the same area, which are formed in length, more or less parallel to each other, on the east side of which Qu√©nonisca Lake, the Rocher Lake crossed by the Nipukatasi River and Amisquioumisca Lake (east side). While on the west side, the major body of water is Evans Lake. Salamander Lake has a length of , a width of , an altitude of and an area of . The Salamandre Lake is mainly fed by forest streams. The areas around the lake have a generally leveled topography.

This convert was originally described as the \\"Rock-Kenonisca Massif\\" by Franconi (1974) in his report on the mapping of the western half of the Frotet-Evans volcano-sedimentary band. It was renamed \\"Rocher-Salamander Intrusive Suite\\" by Brisson et al. (1998) when mapping the Lake Rocher area (NTS sheet 32K09). The addition of Whitefish Intrusion (nAwf) and Rock Intrusion (nAlrc) as lithodemes in the Intrusive Suite of Rocher-Salamandre is proposed following the fieldwork and compilation of Leclerc and Caron-C√¥t√© (2017).Lexicon, Energy and Natural Resources - Quebec - Accessed February 17, 2018. ==Toponymy== In the past, this body of water was designated \\"Big Whitefis Lake\\" or the French version \\"Lac Poisson Blanc\\".

The rock derives its name from the distinctive conical shape reminiscent of an old style sugarloaf. It is designated as a nature reserve and a nesting site for seabirds such as the red-tailed tropicbird. The Cape to Cape track passes by the lookout to the rock. Access to the rock was limited with no road down to the shore present until the mid-1930s; the site was not well known in 1932, with visitors having to \\"scramble through thickets and down the cliff\\" to access the coast. The first recorded drowning off the rock occurred in 1934 when a man was washed from it. A danger sign was erected near the site later the same year.

It was built between 1875 and1878 by Charles Klingerman. In 1878 it was purchased by German immigrants Simon and Hannah Durlacher. ==History== Simon Durlacher (January 31, 1837 - 1893) was born in Schmeiheim, Baden, Germany. He emigrated with his family to Pottsville, Pennsylvania in 1852, where he studied and worked in the dry goods business. After being wounded in service in the Union army during the American Civil War he moved to Burlington, Iowa to work in a clothing store. In 1867 Durlacher moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming and worked in another dry fgoods store. The next year he moved farther west to Laramie, where he worked for Ben Hellman in Hellman's store, which started out in a tent and moved up to a log cabin. After working in another store Durlacher started his own in 1871 with partner William Manesse. A permanent building at 203 2nd Street followed in 1872, which also housed Laramie's Masonic Lodge, of which Durlacher was a member. In 1878 Durlacher made a buying trip to the East Coast and was introduced by friends to fellow German immigrant Hannah Gross (b. 1853) and married her in Boston on October 2, 1878. Upon their arrival in Laramie they bought the house at 501 South 5th Street from Charles and Ella Klingerman for $2000. The family enjoyed an active social life. Simon died in 1893. In 1909 Hannah married Otto Gramm and continued to live in the 5th Street house. She died in 1930. Simon and Hannah's daughter Hilda lived at the house with husband Neale Roach from 1905 to 1941. The house was sold in 1945 to the First Christian Church, which modified the house for its use. It was sold in 1954 to the Salvation Army. The exterior of the house was stuccoed at about this time to address problems with the brick exterior, whose local bricks were known for poor durability. ==Description== The Durlacher House occupies a corner lot at 5th and Custer Streets. The house is 2-1/2 stories tall, with a stuccoed brick first floor and a shingled second floor. A proch extends across both sides facing the streets. The house has a variety of sash windows, including some with stained glass. A prominent arched window faces 5th Street. The house's interior has been extensively altered for its use as a church and for its present use as a business office, but many original interior features remain.

Dictionary of Battles and Sieges. Greenwood Press. p. 516. . Archived from the original on 2015-06-26. Dissatisfied with Nawab Mir Qasim's administration, the English deposed him in favor of his father-in-law Mir Jafar and officially declared war against Mir Qasim on July 7, 1763. The English command was given to Major Thomas Adams, who led a small force, variously estimated as between 3,000 and 5,000 men, of whom, approximately 1,000 were European. The Nawab had a total of approximately 25,000 troops at his disposal, led by the Armenian general Gurgin Khan. Although the Nawab's forces were numerically larger, they were hastily cobbled together and riven by internal strife. The Nawabi force that confronted the English at Katwa was a much smaller contingent under the leadership of the accomplished general Muhammad Taqi Khan, the Faujdar of Birbhum. On July 17, 1763, the English forces marching from various cantonments in Medinipur and Bardhaman districts, established post at Agradwip, a village 14 km downstream from Katwa. There they were met by the newly re-instated Nawab Mir Jafar. Meanwhile, Mir Qasim's forces had established themselves at Palashi, 20 km upstream from Katwa. On that morning, a band of irregular Nawabi forces, mostly cavalry, engaged Lieutenant Glenn of the English forces, who was escorting a convoy of cattle, grain, and treasure to Agradwip. The battle lasted four hours with the treasure changing hands three times. Ultimately, after heavy casualties on both sides, the Nawabi forces withdrew and Lieutenant Glenn pressed his advantage by marching upon the fort at Katwa. The Nawabi garrison at Katwa surrendered after putting up a feeble resistance. Meanwhile, Muhammad Taqi Khan had advanced the main body of his forces to Katwa; and on the morning of July 19, 1763, Major Adams advanced to attack him. The battle which followed has been described as \\"one of the bloodiest and best-contested of the whole war.\\" Ultimately, the British were able to ambush and kill Muhammad Taqi Khan, dealing a double blow to Mir Qasim's cause by winning the immediate battle and depriving Mir Qasim of the expertise and military acumen of one of his best generals in future battles. == See also == * Battle of Buxar ==References== Category:Battles involving Bengal Category:Battles involving the British East India Company Category:Conflicts in 1763 Category:1763 in India ","title":"Third Battle of Katwa"},{"id":"56618170","text":"File:Johann Philipp von Lamberg Johann Philipp von Lamberg (Vienna, 25 May 1652 ‚Äì Regensburg, 21 October 1712) was an Austrian Catholic cardinalThe Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, 21 Jun 1700 and bishop.

Elected bishop of Passau from his own chapter on 25 May 1689, he was granted access to the office despite not yet having received the diaconate with a papal dispensation of 11 January 1690. At the same time, for his consecration as bishop, he was guaranteed the dispensation to be appointed to the episcopal see by a bishop and two abbots working together since on 14 January 1690 there were no bishops in the area who were not involved in other religious or territorial issues. Appointed royal commissioner in Regensburg, he was imperial plenipotentiary minister to the Diet of Regensburg. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of 21 June 1700, he participated in the conclave that at the end of that same year elected Pope Clement XI.

She was a champion of black rights in employment and education. == Early life == She was born as Florence Ruth Barrett on March 17, 1898 to Frank C. and Maude (n√©e Lawson) Barrett in Pennsylvania. She attended Wilberforce University and later moved to Boston in 1935. LeSueur had been a long-time resident of the South End, a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts. == Career == Florence LeSueur was the first to head a Boston-wide education committee under the NAACP. From 1948 until 1951 she served as the president of the Boston branch of the NAACP, and was the first woman president of a branch in the nation. She was recognized for her role of being the first female president of an NAACP Branch when the 41st Annual NAACP Convention took place in 1950. She was joined in attendance at the conference by fellow Massachusetts residents, Boston mayor, John B. Hynes, and Lieutenant Governor Charles E. Jeff Sullivan. Topics being discussed at the conference included \\"The Church and the NAACP\\" and \\"Registration and Voting.\\" LeSueur also founded a program titled METCO (Metropolitan Council for Education Opportunity) with Ruth Batson and Louise Day Hicks. The goal was to bus intercity students in Boston to suburban schools in an attempt to desegregate Boston's schools. LeSueur's granddaughter, was one of the first participants in this program, arriving at East Junior High School in Braintree, MA. She recalls press and photographers outside the school as she left the bus. METCO also assisted parents with fighting for their children's quality of education, as many of the inner city kids were not placed in college prep classes at these newly integrated schools. Florence LeSueur supported and signed a letter with fellow members of the NAACP against the Rankin bill, H.R. 314, in Congress. This letter was sent with support from the NAACP organization on May 24, 1951. This bill created a segregated veterans hospital in Franklin County, Mississippi. The letter that LeSueur signed argued that the location of the hospital would be inaccessible and unnecessary because the veterans were not subjected to segregation while they were fighting in the war and should not be afterwards. During her time with the NAACP, six black men were hired as Boston Elevated Railway drivers (the predecessor of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority), due to her unrelenting determination. In order to persuade transit system officials that blacks deserved better job roles, LeSueur organized demonstrations near the Dudley Square station and she led delegations for the cause. These actions eventually resulted in getting blacks hired at a higher job level as drivers. For more than 20 years she was a director of the NAACP branch. Additionally, in 1959 she served as president of the Harriet Tubman House (now part of United South End Settlements). In her later years in the 1970s, along with her daughter The Rev. Leota Ruth Santos, together they founded a church out of the basement of Florence's home in Brockton, Massachusetts. The Church was named \\"The United Church of The First Born.\\" The church congregation later moved to a site in Hanson, Massachusetts. == Personal life == She died on June 27, 1991 at age 93 in a nursing home in Brockton, Massachusetts.

Plans for the organization were announced in March 2003, and involved former ISU officials Sally-Anne Stapleford, Sonia Bianchetti, Ron Pfenning, and Britta Lindgren. The group promised to judge in an unbiased manner, utilizing the 6.0 system, and ensure that ice skating judging panels will be held accountable, and be geographically balanced. Most of the group's members were noted to be from the United States, or work there. At the time plans for WSF were announced, the group had a planned budget of $1 million, but had only raised about $200,000. The money was mostly raised from individuals making small donations. ==Reception== At the time of the group's founding, it had received no support from any national skating federations, despite claims at the time the United States Figure Skating Association will support the WSF. The USFSA's executive committee would later vote to endorse the WSF's principles, but not the group itself. In addition, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge declined to meet with the group, or consider its platforms, saying the IOC only recognizes one federation per sport. ISU officials condemned efforts at creating the WSF, and also criticized its members, saying they did nothing to produce judging reforms during their time at ISU. Criticisms of WSF members, similar to those voiced by the ISU, were echoed by those outside of the ISU, but the group did receive positive comments from at least one commentator, who said its members were echoing sentiments that are well known for some time. ===Response by ISU=== ISU officials have threatened to punish federations or individuals who support the breakaway group. Hungarian judge Judit Furst-Tombor was dropped from the judging panel at a competition, a day after she joined the press conference announcing the WSF's founding. Some national federations, like Skate Canada, also threatened to expel its members, should they support the WSF. In response, WSF officials filed a lawsuit against ISU in December 2003, citing anti-competitive behavior. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed in February 2005. Shortly thereafter, Pfenning, at the time the group's Acting President, announced that the group will be dissolved. Eventually, ISU decided that Furst-Tombor, along with Stapleford, Pfenning, Lindgren, Jon Jackson and Jan Garden, were excluded from the group. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Ice skating Category:Ice skating governing bodies Category:Ice skating organizations Category:Sports organizations established in the 21st century ","title":"World Skating Federation"},{"id":"56618353","text":"Rrok Gjonlleshaj (born February 10, 1961 in Vele≈æ, SFR Yugoslavia, today Velezha, Kosovo) is a Kosovo-Albanian clergyman and the current Roman Catholic archbishop of Bar. ==Life== After the end of his elementary studies in his native city, Rrok Gjonlleshaj studied philosophy and theology in Rijeka and received on 1 August 1987, the sacrament of Holy Orders for the Apostolic Administration of Prizren.

She received the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire from King George VI in 1924 in recognition of her service. ==Early life== Landau was born to Chaya and Marcus Landau, strict Orthodox Jews who were active in the Jewish community. She attended the Bishopsgate Ward School for elementary school, a school established by reformers of women's education after the 1869 Endowed School Act and supported by the wife of Mayer Amschel de Rothschild. For high school, due to the lack of religious Jewish girls' schools in London, she attended Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch's Jewish High School for Girls in Frankfurt on the Main. This time was a formative period for her; Landau learned Jewish studies and secular studies simultaneously, as well as concepts of Jewish education. After getting a teacher's certificate at the Graystoke Teachers' Training College in 1894, she became a teacher in London at the Westminster Jews' Free School, a Jewish school that took government exams and maintained modern education methods and standards. ==Administration of the Evelina de Rothschild School== The Evelina de Rothschild School was established as the first Jewish school for girls in Israel by Baron Lionel de Rothschild in 1867. It was taken over in 1892 by the Anglo-Jewish Association, who desired to influence the developing cultural character of Israel, although the Baron continued to contribute towards its upkeep. In 1898, seeking trained teachers to improve the educational and hygienic standards of the school, the Anglo-Jewish Association hired 25-year-old Landau to be the school's assistant headmistress. When the headmistress resigned in 1899, Landau was appointed its new headmistress. Landau submitted annual formal reports to the Ladies' Committee of the Anglo-Jewish Association, which included information about the state of the school's finances as well as the progress of the students. ===1898-1913=== The Evelina School grew under Landau's administration. In 1899, Landau's first year as headmistress, there were 292 students in the school and 225 children in kindergarten; by 1903, there were 333 students in the school and 273 in the kindergarten. Although the school was constantly faced with a shortage of space and funds, Landau added teachers to the school staff and incorporated new courses in practical domestic skills into the curriculum. She began a campaign to emphasize health, cleanliness and hygiene among the Evelina School students, especially due to the cholera, meningitis, and scarlet fever epidemics that occasionally spread throughout Jerusalem. During one epidemic the Evelina School was ordered to stay open, as medical authorities felt its premises were cleaner than the students' houses. Landau worked tirelessly to find work for Evelina School graduates. She encouraged her graduates to be self-reliant; Landau knew that girls with jobs often married later, in their upper teens instead of at twelve or thirteen. The Evelina School offered courses and employment opportunities for its graduates, whether in education or domestic skills such as lace-making and needlework. Students started the day with communal Jewish prayer. Classes were held on Sundays through Thursdays, instead of Mondays through Fridays, so that religious students could help their families prepare for Shabbat. On Thursday afternoons the school held Kabbalat Shabbat ceremonies, where Landau spoke to the students about the week's Torah portion. Despite the school's Jewish character, Landau came under fire from Ashkenazi rabbis, who felt that secular knowledge would lead the students to abandon religion. At the same time, the Zionists resented Landau's school for teaching both Hebrew and English and demanded that it teach only Hebrew, which Landau resisted. Notably, the Evelina School did not participate in the 1913 Palestinian Language Strike, when advocates of Hebrew language instruction urged the closing of all Jewish schools to back their cause. ===World War I=== During World War I, all British citizens in Palestine were given the choice of becoming Ottoman subjects or leaving the country. As an English citizen, Landau left Palestine in 1915 for Alexandria, leaving Ella Schwartzstein as acting headmistress. In Alexandria, Landau worked with the Anglo-Egyptian authorities to provide schooling and social services for hundreds of refugee children from Palestine and Syria. During the war, most of the teachers in the Evelina School were forced to leave and the school did not have the funds to continue operating. In 1916, the Turkish authorities in Palestine closed the school and the building was used to quarter soldiers. Landau was the first woman permitted to return to Jerusalem after General Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem; when Landau insisted, military governor of Jerusalem Ronald Storrs, returned the school building to Anglo-Jewish Association. ===1918-1945=== Landau's work as headmistress continued from her return to Jerusalem in 1918 through her death in 1945. During these years, new subjects were added to the school, specially secretarial skills that were needed by the British administration. The growth of the student body, especially the arrival of German girls in the 1930s, presented new challenges. In her later years, the Evelina School created a branch of Henrietta Szold's Youth Aliyah program and established the Schwartzstein dormitory. ==Personal Life== Landau was a religious Orthodox Jew and opposed the missionary schools in Jerusalem. She never married. She remained close to her siblings and their children, including her nephew Oliver Sacks and returned annually to visit her family in London. Her close friends were Evelina School teachers who had come from England. ==Death and legacy== Landau died on 23 January 1945. She is buried on the Mount of Olives, near Henrietta Szold. Landau was profiled in Dr. Laura Schor's The Best School in Jerusalem: Annie Landau‚Äôs School for Girls 1900-1960 (2013). ==References== Category:1873 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Schoolteachers from London Category:Women school principals and headteachers Category:Israeli schoolteachers ","title":"Annie Landau"},{"id":"56618365","text":"Ma is a 2019 American psychological horror film produced, co-written and directed by Tate Taylor. It stars Octavia Spencer, Juliette Lewis, Diana Silvers, Corey Fogelmanis, and Luke Evans, and follows a group of teenagers who befriend a lonely middle-aged woman. She lets them party in her basement, and they end up being terrorized by her. The film was produced by Jason Blum through his Blumhouse Productions company, along with Tate Taylor and John Norris. Initially, Ma came together as a result of Taylor's desire to direct a film about \\"something fucked up\\" and Spencer's desire to break away from the kinds of roles she usually gets to play. Taylor and Spencer are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as The Help and Get on Up. Later, in 2018, Taylor and Blumhouse Productions began developing the film, with Taylor directing, Landes writing, Blum producing and Spencer starring. Principal photography on the film started in February 2018 and wrapped in March 2018, in Mississippi, with some parts shot in Natchez. Ma was released in the United States on May 31, 2019, by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Spencer's performance but criticized the pacing and the script's handling of the teenage characters, and said the film did not take full advantage of its compelling premise. Nevertheless, the film was a commercial success, grossing $61.1 million against its $5 million budget. ==Plot== Teenager Maggie Thompson moves with her mother Erica to her Ohio hometown after Erica's husband leaves her. At her new high school, Maggie befriends Haley, Darrell, Chaz, and Andy, who immediately develops a crush on her. They convince Sue Ann \\"Ma\\" Ellington, a veterinary technician, to help buy them alcohol because they are underage. Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day, Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. The next time they go, Sue Ann has decorated her basement and many other teenagers show up at her house to party, making her popular among the students. However, her hospitality starts to annoy the group as she continuously harasses them to spend time with her. One night, Sue Ann sees Andy and Maggie kissing and becomes jealous; she is in love with him, having had a crush on his father, Ben, in high school. She drugs Maggie and takes her earrings. The next morning, Maggie wakes up and notices her earrings are missing and is badly bruised and cut. Scared, Maggie tells Andy that she does not want to go to Sue Ann's house anymore and that she does not want him to go, either. To earn the group's trust back, Ma lies to them that she has pancreatic cancer. As she is talking, Haley notices that she is wearing a bracelet that belongs to a friend of theirs. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage; Maggie is surprised to see her walking, as she uses a wheelchair at school. Genie tells them to leave as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape. Andy's father Ben, who went to high school with Sue Ann, shows up at her job to drop off his cat and invites her out for drinks after work. Sue Ann goes home to change and meets him at the bar, where Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house so much. Ben warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben in high school, performed fellatio on him in a closet. Once she left the closet, it turned out that she had been doing it to another boy and Ben had tricked her. Ben had gotten the entire school to witness the event (including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica), and Sue Ann suffered devastating humiliation, which she never recovered from. An increasingly unstable Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up trapped in her bed; Sue Ann pumps Louie's blood into his body, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann, and Erica grounds her. Sue Ann sends Maggie a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. She sneaks out of the house to confront him. When she arrives, she notices that everyone has left and that only the original group remain. She tries to get Andy to leave but soon realizes that Andy and the rest of her friends have been drugged. Maggie tries to get help and in the process finds Ben's body. As she stands there in horror, Sue Ann renders her unconscious. Maggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann, as he is well aware that she is in love with him. She kisses him, but stabs him after realizing that he is lying. A police officer arrives and when Maggie screams for help, Sue Ann shoots him dead before he can react. She then gathers the four friends around the couch with her and makes Maggie take photos of them together in a crude recreation of the friendship Sue Ann always longed for but never had. Sue Ann then leaves Maggie to be hanged before Genie intervenes. Everyone else wakes up to discover what Sue Ann has done to them but barely have time to react as the house is on fire and need to find a way out. Erica, knowing where Maggie would be, calls her co-worker Stu for help and the two save the teenagers. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire, blaming Erica for not stopping Ben from pulling the prank in school. Maggie stabs Sue Ann, saving Genie. The group goes outside and asks what has happened. Sue Ann walks upstairs and lies down next to Ben's corpse, cuddling with it as the house burns. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Development=== Ma came together as a result of Tate Taylor's desire to direct a film about \\"something fucked up,\\" and a conversation he had with Octavia Spencer in which she told him that she was \\"sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead.\\" The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as The Help and Get on Up. Jason Blum and Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially. Taylor went to Blum's office, reiterating, \\"I want to do something really fucked up.\\" He read Scotty Landes' script of the film, which Blumhouse Productions had bought the day before. Although the original draft was written with a white woman in the title role, Taylor immediately thought about Spencer. He went out to the hall, called Spencer, and asked her if she would like to be in a horror film; without reading the script, Spencer boarded the project. There was no backstory for the title character in the original script, which made her \\"a complete monster that no audience member could sympathize with.\\" The filmmakers made it a priority to come up with an authentic backstory for the role. Taylor thought it was important to weave the themes of trauma, the sins of our parents, and how we treat people into the story to create a character audiences can relate to and feel bad for. ===Filming=== Principal photography on the film started in February 2018. Filming took place in Mississippi, with parts shot in Natchez, and wrapped in March 2018. ==Release== Ma was released on May 31, 2019. The first trailer was released on February 13, 2019. ===Home media=== Ma was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 3, 2019. ==Reception== ===Box office=== Ma grossed $45.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $14.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $60.6 million, against a production budget of $5 million. In the United States and Canada, Ma was released alongside Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Rocketman, and was projected to gross around $20 million in its opening weekend. The film made $7.2 million on its first day, including $1.4 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $18.4 million, finishing fourth at the box office. The film made $7.8 million in its second weekend (dropping 54% and finishing in seventh), and then made $3.7 million in its third weekend. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 55% based on 198 reviews, with an average rating of 5.62/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Octavia Spencer's performance overpowers many of Mas flaws, but uneven pacing and a labored story keep this thriller from fully realizing its unhinged potential.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 2.5 out of 5 stars. Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, describing it as \\"a nasty yet surprisingly empathetic slab of exploitation with more than just carnage on its mind.\\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly rated the film a grade of B, specifying, \\"Even as the story descends into full bloody camp at its crescendo, Spencer holds the more ludicrous plot threads together.\\" Owen Glieberman of Variety wrote, \\"Spencer, a chameleon of an actress, does mood swings in Ma that leave us entertainingly off guard.\\" Jude Dry of IndieWire gave the film a grade of C, stating that \\"it takes an amusing premise, reduces it to its most basic parts, then weighs it down with silly scare tactics,\\" while John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"It quickly spins its shaky premise off into an unconvincing study of emotional need and an even harder- to-believe revenge thriller.\\" At 2019's Saturn Awards, Spencer was nominated for Best Actress and the film was nominated for Best Thriller Film. ==ReferencesCategory:2019 films Category:2019 horror thriller films Category:2019 psychological thriller films Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:2010s teen horror films Category:African- American horror films Category:American films Category:American films about revenge Category:American horror thriller films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American teen horror films Category:Blumhouse Productions films Category:Films about bullying Category:Films about racism Category:Films about rape Category:Films directed by Tate Taylor Category:Films produced by Jason Blum Category:Films set in Ohio Category:Films shot in Mississippi Category:Teen thriller films ","title":"Ma (film)"},{"id":"56618388","text":"Jews applying for identification and work permits, The Krak√≥w Jewish Council (In German: Judenrat) was a 24-person Jewish managerial board formally established in the city of Krak√≥w, Poland by German authorities in December 1939, and later in the Krak√≥w Ghetto when the ghetto was officially formed on March 3, 1941. The Krak√≥w Jewish Council formation was mandated by Nazi administration officials, who demanded that these councils be formed as supervisors of the inmates of their respective ghettos in the General Government, and in other occupied areas. The Jewish Council in Krak√≥w was in direct contact and controlled by Nazi officials on most matters, but had some limited degree of autonomy.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 43. The Krakow Jewish council had 19 separate departments that oversaw labor, welfare, health and finance, among other items.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 52. Along with other Jewish Councils in the General Government, the Krak√≥w Jewish Council was established by a general decree from Hans Frank, the Governor-general of the General Government, on November 28, 1939, following a statement by Reinhard Heydrich on September 21, 1939 with similar aims . However, the Krak√≥w Ghetto was not formally established in the Podg√≥rze area of the Krak√≥w District until March 3, 1941. Prior to March 3, the offices of the Jewish Council were located at 41 Krak√≥w Street and, after the ghetto was established, the offices were located in the ghetto at the corner of Limanowski and Rynek Podgorski streets. == Organizational structure and functions == === General characteristics === The Jewish Councils were created to serve the purposes of the Nazi regime; they had prescribed tasks by the Nazi government and ones in which they took initiative. Isaiah Trunk, author of Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation believes the tasks of the Jewish Councils, in general, are divided into three classes: > 1\\\\. Tasks imposed by the authorities, such as conduct of the census of the > Jewish population, the supply of forced labor and registration of candidates > for a work camp, for deportation, etc. > 2\\\\. Routine tasks in social welfare, medical care, and in the economic and > cultural fields- tasks which were a continuation of prewar communal > activities > 3\\\\. New tasks made essential by the complete elimination of the Jewish > population in the ghetto from governmental and municipal services such as > food supplies, the management of the ghetto dwellings, industry, health, > police and judicial services, etc.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish > Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 44. Hans Frank and Reinhard Heydrich separate, but similar decrees defined a Jewish Council as a council of 24 Jews who are elected to their positions by the inhabitants of a particular ghetto.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 5. However, for the Krak√≥w Jewish Council, the composition of the council greatly changed because of resignations, arrests and murders, etc. from the first council to when the Krak√≥w Ghetto was liquidated.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 331. Local Nazi officials would directly and indirectly change the composition of the Krak√≥w Jewish Council, when they were discontent with a particular action, and the Krak√≥w Ghetto is known to have been greatly disadvantaged by the change in administration. The first chairman of the Krak√≥w Jewish Council was chosen by SS-Oberscharfuhrer Mark Siebert, who ordered that role to be filled by Marek Bilberstein. While in most cases a particular ghetto's Jewish Council served the inhabitants of that particular ghetto, there was a proposal, made by, and for the Krak√≥w Jewish Council to become a central Jewish Council that would oversee the Ghettos in the Krak√≥w district and act on behalf of their interests; however, nothing came of this proposition.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 40. === Administrative tasks === Among the tasks of the Krak√≥w Jewish Council was the establishment of housing in the city of Krak√≥w -and later the Krak√≥w Ghetto- for previous displaced inhabitants of Krak√≥w and impoverished Jewish immigrants from other areas in the General Government and the Greater Reich. In the fall of 1939, the Jewish Council had to find living space for over 8,000 immigrants in the already grossly overpopulated sector of the city.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.107. During the Jewish Council‚Äôs control of the Krak√≥w Ghetto, the Nazi ghetto officials would arbitrarily change the boundaries of the ghetto, further displacing Jews in the ghetto, which made this task for the Jewish Council especially challenging.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.134. As mentioned, the Jewish Council sought out and coordinated housing for immigrants to its community. To highlight the ingenuity of children in the ghettos, despite the horrific conditions,14-year old Jack Gruener, who arrived with his parents and was told by the Krak√≥w Jewish Council to share a 3-bedroom apartment with 12 other people; the lack of privacy was difficult for most families, but Jack later discovered a dwelling for him and his family in the attic of the house they were inhabiting. Furthermore, The Krak√≥w Jewish Council was ordered to provide a census of the Jewish population in the ghetto that included age, sex and occupation.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.174. The Jewish Council was also allowed to establish a post office in the ghetto that the council was allowed to yield a tax from.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 181. As Jews were isolated in the ghetto from the surrounding society, the Krak√≥w Jewish Council was also given permission by the German authorities to pass judgement on certain litigation including, but not limited to, mediation between sub-tenants and tenants. The Krak√≥w Jewish Council was also responsible for taxing the Jews in the ghetto.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.239. This was performed by means of a regular tax and an extraordinary tax, where the former refers to a tax that all citizens, whereas the latter refers to specific taxes on items such as birth and wedding certificates and fees for the post office. == Relationships with other groups in the Krak√≥w Ghetto == === Ghetto police === The Krak√≥w Ghetto Jewish Police were responsible for enforcing the decrees of the Nazis and the Jewish Council. Ghetto Jewish police were established on order of Nazi authorities, as with the Jewish councils, however, they were established by local Nazi officials, as opposed to an order from a central Nazi authority, like the decree that established the Jewish Councils.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.475. Nazi officials wanted it to appear that Jews initiated the need for a ghetto police, and so they prompted the Krak√≥w Jewish council to ask the local militia captain (stadthauptmann) for permission, and permission was subsequently granted. Furthermore, the Jewish council was involved in choosing the ghetto police and ‚Äúnepotism and graft‚Äù were highly prevalent in the selection.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.489. However, soon after the Krak√≥w ghetto police was formed they \\"severed ties\\" with the Jewish Council. === Aid organizations === There were other Jewish organizations that provided aid within the ghettos, and the Jewish Council would interact with their functionaries.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p. 340. A particular organization, the JSS (Jewish Social Welfare) agency held a conference in September 1940 that brought together the representatives from the Jewish councils of Warsaw, Radom, Lublin, Czestochowa, and Krak√≥w that had the aim of reducing the excessive burden on forced laborers in the various camps. == Public aid == === Public health === Communicable disease was rampant due to the unsanitary conditions of the communities and efforts were made by the Jewish council to limit those disease through public health measures. In February 1940, The Krak√≥w Health Department was established by physicians and run by Dr. Moritz Haber, a council member.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.163. A portion of the budget was funded by the council, the rest from voluntary donations. This department oversaw the medical and hygienic care of ghetto shelters (mostly for immigrants) and the other ‚Äúliving section‚Äù of the ghetto. The health department also coordinated the work of 156 physicians, 110 aides, along with facilities that included an outpatient clinic, radiology institute, a communicable disease station (as mandated by German authorities), and the only pharmacy in the Krak√≥w Ghetto, although it only provided basic medicines. In September 1940, a mere 36 patients were admitted to the hospital with infectious diseases, which was a result of the measures in place by the Jewish Council. Lastly, to compensate for loss of public health officials, the Jewish Council, in the summer of 1940 operated a training course for hygiene personnel where 63 lectures and 5 day practical course was conducted for education on the fundamentals of hygiene theory.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.167. === Welfare === In the ghettos, there were a few different relief organizations that were involved in welfare operations in the ghettos, such as Jewish Social Welfare (JSS) which worked in the General Government areas, along with the Jewish Councils.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.121-122. However, the JSS welfare in Krak√≥w, and later in the Krak√≥w ghetto was limited because Nazi officials limited the amount of aid they could provide.The Krak√≥w Jewish council provided welfare in the form of soup kitchens, cash payouts and medicine. == Resistance to German orders == Considering the immense power of the Nazi authority and the belief that obedience was the best solution to maintain viability of Jewish life, the Jewish Council complied with most of the Nazi decrees.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.388-398. However, there were certain important instances of resistance. The first council chairman, Marek Biberstein, a teacher and a public activist, was arrested, along with four other council members, for disobeying the expulsion orders of May 1940 to April 1941.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.438. Biberstein and two others from the council were sentenced to jail. Furthermore, the second council chairman, Dr. Artur Rosenzweig, was arrested and him and his family were sent to Belzec Extermination camp, since Nazi ghetto officials were unhappy with the ‚Äúnumber and technique of delivery of people to the assembly square‚Äù for the resettlement of June 1942 to extermination and labor camps.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. Macmillan. p.440. Nazi ghetto officials then made David Gutter, the last chairman of the Krak√≥w Ghetto. == References == Category:Krak√≥w Ghetto Category:German occupation of Poland during World War II Category:Judenrat ","title":"Krak√≥w Ghetto Jewish Council"},{"id":"56618390","text":"Mohamed El Moussaoui (), known by the stage name MoTrip (born March 7, 1988), is a German rapper of Lebanese descent. His stage name uses the first syllable of his name and plays off the Arabic word for \\"singer\\" or \\"lyricist\\". MoTrip came into his own with hits such as 2013's \\"Guten Morgen NSA\\" (\\"Good Morning NSA\\") and his 2015 song \\"So wie du bist\\" (\\"Just as you are\\"). Since 2011, he has been under contract with Universal Music. ==Early life== Mohamed El Moussaoui was born in Beirut, Lebanon, though his family fled the country during the Lebanese Civil War. He grew up in Aachen, at Germany's borders with Belgium and the Netherlands. El Moussaoui's older brother was also a rapper and the young MoTrip began writing his first lyrics at the age of 15. Aachen was also the hometown of Turkish-German rapper Kool Savas, who took notice of the up-and-coming MoTrip. With the promotion of Kool Savas, MoTrip was able to make important industry connections and promote his work. ==Career== According to MoTrip, he has written or contributed to writing many German-language rap tracks performed by other artists. He says that all of the lyrics he performs, however, are his own words. While MoTrip has not indicated for whom he has written music, in 2011, German rapper Eko Fresh claimed on Twitter that MoTrip wrote the Fler album Airmax Muzik II.Ghostwriting im HipHop: Welche Texte wurden nicht selbst geschrieben?

MoTrip's first album, Embryo, was released in 2011. His first charting single did not come until his 2013 song \\"Guten Morgen NSA\\" (\\"Good Morning NSA\\"). In the context of the United States' National Security Agency spying controversy, MoTrip mocked NSA surveillance for hacking his Game Boy. Comparing the NSA to the 'Stasi', the official state security service of East Germany, MoTrip was echoing a comparison first made by German chancellor Angela Merkel. The song also remarks on MoTrip's status as an Arab in Europe. The 2015 album Mama featured the hit single \\"So wie du bist\\" (\\"Just as you are\\"), which became MoTrip's highest charting song, reaching number 3 on the German charts. The track featured German vocalist Lary who appeared as a stripper in the music video, romantically pursued by MoTrip. The song remained at number 51 on the charts until it was featured as background music for a Beats by Dre commercial, which focused on German football player Bastian Schweinsteiger and his departure from long-time club Bayern Munich to join Manchester United. The commercial catapulted the song to the top of the charts. ==References== Category:German rappers Category:Living people Category:1988 births Category:German people of Lebanese descent ","title":"MoTrip"},{"id":"56618398","text":"Germani is an Italian surname that may refer to *Fernando Germani (1906‚Äì1998), Italian organist * Gaia Germani (born 1942), Italian film and television actress *Remo Germani (1938‚Äì2010), Italian singer Category:Italian-language surnames ","title":"Germani (surname)"},{"id":"56618430","text":"The Evelina de Rothschild School was the first Jewish school for girls in Israel. ==Founding and Early Years (1854-1899)== The school was founded in 1854 in the Old City of Jerusalem by Dr. Albert Cohen. The students learned domestic tasks such as sewing and knitting. Baron Lionel de Rothschild became the school's patron in 1867, naming it after his daughter Evelina who had died the previous year. The Anglo-Jewish Association took control of the school in 1962, out of a desire to influence the developing cultural character of Israel, although the baron continued to make a donation of ¬£800 to the school every year. The school served a diverse population; there were both Ashkenazi and Sephardi students, as well as students who were Moroccan, Karaite, and Armenian Christian. The school was overseen by the nearby Rothschild Hospital, in the Old City of Jerusalem. In 1886, Dr. Yitzchak Schwartz, who oversaw the hospital, submitted the following report regarding the school: ==Administration== When in 1888 the Rothschild Hospital moved into a larger building outside of the Old City, the Rothschilds appointed Fortun√©e Behar as the school's first headmistress.

responsibility for the day-to-day civil administration of the British Royal Navy from (1576-1832). It contained all the members of the Navy Board and various other departments and offices. The day-to-day business of the Navy Office was administered by Clerk of the Acts from 1660 until 1796, who was responsible for the organisation of the office and management of its staff. When his office was abolished his duties were assumed by separate committees for Accounts, Correspondence, Stores, Transports and Victualling who were, in turn, presided over by the Comptroller of the Navy until 1832. It was one of two government offices (the other being the Department of Admiralty) that were jointly responsible for directing naval affairs. In 1832 following reforms of the naval service the Navy Office was abolished all of its functions and staff were merged within the Admiralty. ==History== In 1576 the Navy Office replaced the Office of the Council of the Marine. It was initially located at Deptford for most of the sixteenth century. It later moved to collection of offices in the Tower Hill area of London until around 1654. The office then moved to a new building at the crossroad of Crutched Friars and Seething Lane. Until 1628 following the creation of the Board of Admiralty the Navy Office was an independent advisory office to the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office when it became a subsidiary yet autonomous component of that office. In 1673 the office was destroyed by a fire and a new building was constructed to house its staff that took 10 years to complete. The Navy Office continued to be based in Tower Hill until 1786 when it relocated to a much large office space at Somerset House where it remained until it was abolished in 1832. The primary organisation within the office was the Navy Board and the various offices of its principal commissioners. However, the Treasurer of the Navy although a principal member of the board administered a separate Navy Pay Office. From 1567 until 1660 the office was administered by the Comptroller of the Navy. In 1660 the Clerk of the Acts became responsible for the organisation of the Navy Office. In 1796 administration of the Navy Office was placed under the supervision of three Committees, of Correspondence, Accounts and Stores. Throughout its history its clerical supporting staff consisting of chief clerks then first, second and third class clerks were assigned to the various offices and departments within the Navy Office. In 1808 the Naval Works Department was relocated from the Admiralty to the Navy Office. A Ticket and Wages Branch was formed in 1829. In 1832 the Navy Office and subsequently the Navy Board were abolished its functions were then transferred to the Department of Admiralty under supervision of the Board of Admiralty. ==Organisation and structure of the Navy Office== The Navy Office provided accommodation for the Commissioners of the Navy Board and senior clerical and secretarial staff, as well as office space. Different branches, departments and offices were located within different parts of the Navy Office in London, England. Royal Navy Dockyards both in the United Kingdom and overseas were also part of this office. ===Components of the Navy Office=== The Navy Office consisted of a number of specific component parts that included: ====Boards==== The Navy Board and formerly known as the Council of the Marine or Council of the Marine Causes was the organisation with responsibility for the day-to-day civil administration of the Royal Navy between 1546 and 1832.

He was one of several cardinals from his family by this name. He is the uncle of Cardinal Giovanni Delfino (iuniore). Graduated in utroque jure at the University of Padua, he seemed to want to embrace the ecclesiastical state, but was instead initiated into a political and diplomatic career; after having exercised some minor offices in Venice, in 1577 he was appointed podest√† and captain of Belluno. Between 1582 and 1595 he was sent as ambassador of the Republic of Venice to Poland, Spain, Germany and France, whence he returned eight years later to go to the role of ambassador to the Holy See, a post he held until 1598.Giovanni Mantese, Memorie storiche della Chiesa vicentina, IV/1, Dal 1563 al 1700, (Vicenza, Accademia Olimpica, 1974). p.143. In the same year he officially represented Venice at the wedding of Philip III of Spain and in 1601 to those of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici. Returning to his homeland he took the post of San Marco's attorney and the reformer of Studio Padovano. In 1603, the Bishop of Vicenza remained vacant, Pope Clement VIII decided to assign him to Dolfin, to whom he was bound by ties of sympathy and mutual respect, although he was not a priest and the Venetian law did not allow ecclesiastical offices to be held by those who they had resided at the court of Rome.Guglielmo Berchet, Relazioni degli stati europei lette al Senato dagli ambasciatori Veneti nel secolo decimosettimo, Venezia, 1857, Vol. I, page 56.

In 1656 Girolamo Gradenigo wanted him as coadjutor in the Patriarchate of Aquileia. He succeeded him, as patriarch, two years later. On the request of the Republic of Venice, on 8 March 1667 Pope Alexander VII appointed him cardinal of San Salvatore in Lauro and then of the Saints Vito, Modesto and Crescenzia. He was abbot commendatore of the abbey of Rosazzo from 1668 until his death. He participated in the conclave of 1667, that of 1669-1670, that of 1676, that of 1689 and finally that of 1691; indeed during the latter his name re-entered among those of the papabili but his election was blocked by the Spaniards who did not see favorably a Venetian on the papal throne.Giovanni Delfino, \\"Della Terra\\", a c. di F.

The ancient Roman town of Tagaste, corresponding to the city of Souk Ahras in Algeria, was the seat of an ancient episcopal diocese during the Roman and Vandal empires in what was the Roman province of Numidia. Tagaste is famous for being the birthplace of Augustine, who was a bishop in nearby Hippo (now Annaba), and his mother, Monica. Near Tagaste, Saint Melanie the young founded two monasteries in one of the vast possessions of her property in Roman Africa, where she lived a few years before going to Jerusalem where she died in 439. The first known bishop of Tagaste is Fermo, who suffered martyrdom in the late 3rd century and is remembered by the Vetus Martyrologium Romanum on 31 July: \\"Tagaste, in Africa, sancti Firmi Episcopi, confessionis gloria conspicui\\". St. Augustine mentions it in the work The lie.La menzogna, cap. 13,23. . The next known bishop is Alypius, a disciple and friend of Augustine, also remembered by Vetus Martyrologium Romanum on August 15.In Alipio Augustin dedicates three chapters of the book VI of his Confessions. Confessioni, libro VI, cap. 7-10. The third known bishop of Tagaste is Gennaro, who participated in the synod gathered in Carthage by the Huneric the Vandal in 484, after which he was exiled. Today, Tagaste survives as a titular bishop's seat; the current archbishop, personal title, holder is Ivo Scapolo, apostolic nuncio to Portugal. ==Known Bishops== * San Fermo (before Constantine I) * Alypius of Thagaste, (before 403 - after 429) * Gennaro (mentioned in 484) * Luis Jos√© Mar√≠a Amig√≥ y Ferrer (1854-1934) * Jo√£o di Enitra, (1452 - ???) * Francesco of Maiorana (1476 -???) * Arnaldo di Bedoreto, (1511 -???) * Filippo Varagi of San Paolo, (1514 -???) * Crist√≥bal Barrionuevo (1515 - 1552) * Juan de Porto (1517 - ???) * Bernardo de And√∫jar (1525 - 1534) * Melchiorre de Cribellis, (1540 -???) * Gregorio Silvio, (1552 - 1578) * Andrea Strenguart, (1578 - 1615) * Angelo Rocca, (1605 - 1620) * Giovanni Battista d'Aste(1620 - 1620) * Giovanni Vincenzo Spinola, (1620 - 1623) * Giovanni Dolfin (1656 - 1657) * Antonio Marinari, (1667 -???) * Manuel da Silva Frances (1708 - 1727) * Alessandro Caputo, (1728 - 1731) * Blas Antonio Ol√≥riz(1733 - ???) * Giuseppe Maria Marini, (1754 - ???) * Jean-Baptiste du Plessis d'Argentr√© (1774 - 1775) * Francisco Mateo Aguiriano G√≥mez (1776 - 1790) * Francesco Bugliari (1792 - 1806) * Eug√®ne-Paul Coupat,(1882 - 1890) * Anatole-Joseph Toulotte(1891 - 1907) * Luis Jos√© Mar√≠a Amig√≥ y Ferrer (1907 - 1913)) * Patrick Joseph Hayes (1914 - 1919) * Godefroy Frederix (1920 - 1938) * Costantino Maria Attilio Barneschi (1939 - 1951) * Antonio Poma (1951 - 1954) * Gilberto Baroni (1954 - 1963) * Luigi Bettazzi (1963 - 1966) * Antonio Mauro (1967 - 2001) ==References== Category:Catholic titular sees in Africa Category:Ancient Algeria ","title":"Thagaste (diocese)"},{"id":"56618860","text":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Suu Minazuki.

However, if this Count decreases to 0, the person will be dragged down into \\"the abyss\\", and is said to be dead for all eternity.

Ever since her mother was dragged into the abyss, she has been searching for the Legendary Ace from her mother's last wish for the last five years. Hina's grueling journey takes a sudden turn when she meets a strange masked knight known as Licht Bach with a negative-numbered Count. ==Characters== ; : :First appearing as a strange pervert wearing a mask, Licht is later revealed to be a Legendary Fabled Ace (powerful heroes that lived over 300 years ago where they put an end to the ongoing waste war) while seemingly carrying two counts (a ballot), it is hinted that he may have another.

The rock formation takes its name from the narrow channel between the rocks that has formed from the coastal waters eroding the granite-gneiss away over time. The rocks that make up the canals are part of the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge, or Leeuwin complex. The rocks that make up the feature consist of hornblende-biotite monzogranite gneiss that are medium to coarse-grained and moderately foliated containing minerals such as perthite, quartz, hornblende with accessory biotite, opaques, apatite, and zircon. The original rock that underwent medium metamorphism was granite. The estimated age of crystallisation is 702 ¬± 7 million years. The Cape to Cape Track passes near the lookout over the rocks. Facilities at the site include a car park, boat ramp, finger jetty and a walkway to access the closest rock formation. A small, unpatrolled beach is found to the lee-side of the rocks with low to subtidal sand and patchy rock reefs. Canal Rocks walkway from above The road through to the site, which was already a popular fishing and recreational area, was constructed in 1907 from Caves Road. A man went missing when diving alone off the rocks in 2010. A fisherman drowned when fishing off the rocks in 2014; his body was never recovered but he is thought to have been washed from the rocks by a freak wave. ==References== Category:Rock formations of Western Australia Category:Yallingup, Western Australia ","title":"Canal Rocks"},{"id":"56618920","text":"James E.

That same day, he was a candidate for city council president. His election was opposed a group of eight freshmen councilors and one second term member (Mildred Harris), who voted for William J. Galvin. Agnew and Galvin each had nine votes, while the three Republican councilors refused to vote for either. Agnew withdrew from the race on January 13, citing his added duties as Fish and Game Commissioner. He backed George A. Murray, who went on to win the presidency on the 11th ballot. In 1942, Agnew was the Democratic nominee for Massachusetts Attorney General. He lost to Republican Robert T. Bushnell 56% to 43%.

The sum of the labels is 11, smaller than could be achieved using only two labels. In graph theory, a sum coloring of a graph is a labeling of its vertices by positive integers, with no two adjacent vertices having equal labels, that minimizes the sum of the labels. The minimum sum that can be achieved is called the chromatic sum of the graph. Chromatic sums and sum coloring were introduced by Supowit in 1987 using non-graph-theoretic terminology, and first studied in graph theoretic terms by Ewa Kubicka (independently of Supowit) in her 1989 doctoral thesis. Obtaining the chromatic sum may require using more distinct labels than the chromatic number of the graph, and even when the chromatic number of a graph is bounded, the number of distinct labels needed to obtain the optimal chromatic sum may be arbitrarily large. Computing the chromatic sum is NP-hard. However it may be computed in linear time for trees and pseudotrees, and in polynomial time for outerplanar graphs. There is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for interval graphs and for bipartite graphs. The interval graph case remains NP- hard.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though its capable cast is clearly game, an over- reliance on gore and a grimly‚Äîand at times comically‚Äîconvoluted narrative blurs Sees bold vision.\\" On Metacritic the series has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Variety's Daniel D'Addario was critical of the show, saying it: \\"Wastes the time of Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard, among others, on a story that starts from a position of fun, giddy strangeness and drags itself forward at a lugubrious pace.\\" Ben Travers at IndieWire responded positively: \\"Steven Knight's action-drama is a strange-but-effective blend\\" and \\"the balance isn‚Äôt quite there yet, as episodes don‚Äôt exactly earn their hourlong run time. Momoa, meanwhile, fits the role well.\\" ===Accolades=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Award ! scope=\\"col\\" Date of ceremony ! scope=\\"col\\" Category ! scope=\\"col\\" Recipient(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" Result ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Visual Effects Society Awards  rowspan=\\"1\\" January 29, 2020 Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Episode  Adrian de Wet, Eve Fizzinoglia, Matthew Welford, Pedro Sabrosa, Tom Blacklock   rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" } ==References== ==External links== * ‚Äì official site * Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2010s American drama television series Category:2010s American science fiction television series Category:Dystopian television series Category:Dystopian web series Category:English-language television shows Category:Apple TV+ original programming Category:Television series set in the future Category:Television shows set in British Columbia Category:Television series produced in Vancouver Category:Post-apocalyptic television series Category:Post-apocalyptic web series Category:Television series created by Steven Knight Category:Television productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"See (TV series)"},{"id":"56619304","text":"Ewa Maria Kubicka is a Polish mathematician interested in graph theory and actuarial science.

John's mother, Lily, was half Swiss/German, and lived for most of her married life in the family house in Chlomos in Corfu. She and her husband Philip cared for John and his younger brother, Max, saw the occupation of Corfu during WWII, and lived through the bombings by Italians, Germans, British and Americans, only to be plunged immediately into the Greek Civil War of 1946 to 1949. At the end of the War having served in the Greek Navy, John studied economics and law at the University of Athens, earning a B.Sc. (Econ.) degree in 1948. He arrived in South Africa in September 1952 with his first wife, Helen, and started work as an insurance broker. In 1967 he studied for a B.Sc. in Natural Science through the University of South Africa, and the following year enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand for an M.Sc. degree in botany and geography. Over a period of more than 50 years John Lavranos undertook numerous visits to remote regions in southern Arabia, Somalia and Socotra, Kenya and Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, Reunion Island, Mauritius, Canary Islands, Greece, and in his final years, the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Chile. His trips through South Africa included Namaqualand, Mpumalanga, and the Richtersveld. He discovered and described many new species of succulent plants, collaborating with organisations such as the National Museum of Natural History (France), the Institute of Tropical Botany of Florence, Kew Gardens, Jardin Exotique de Monaco, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. His contributions were published mainly in the 'Cactus & Succulent Journal', and he confined himself to Asclepiadaceae, Pelargoniums, Aloes and other succulents. His collection of pressed specimens numbered some 32 000, and he described or co-described approximately 180 taxa. He settled in Loul√©, a small town near Faro in southern Portugal in 1995 and donated most of his plants to the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens. Maintaining his passion for plants, he continued an active correspondence with other botanists, often setting aside time for succulent enthusiasts. He is commemorated in the genus Lavrania in the family Apocynaceae, Aloe lavranosii Reynolds, Eriospermum lavranosii P.L.Perry, Caralluma lavranii Rauh & Wertel, Sarcocaulon lavranii Halda, Phagnalon lavranosii Qaiser & Lack Aloe lavranosii is from Yemen and is unusual in being hairy with yellow-green flowers. Crassula susannae was named for Suzanne Lavranos, the second wife of John Lavranos. Caralluma mireillae Lavranos, was named after John's third wife, Mireille, who died in 2014, and whom he had met in Djibouti. She was very supportive of his botanical explorations and often accompanied him. All three of John's marriages were childless. John was known to be pragmatic, forthright, precise, energetic, and with a lively sense of humour. His knowledge of botany and geology was formidable, and this extended to climatology, geography, astronomy, history and music - he was an accomplished pianist earlier in his life. Despite being an agnostic his biblical knowledge was extensive. He was a polyglot and comfortable in Ancient Greek and Latin, and fluent in Greek, English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Afrikaans.

He entered the seminary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society in July 1952 and was ordained on 11 June 1854. On 25 August 1854, less than two months after his ordination, he was sent to Hong Kong. Together with Father Prudence Seraphin-Barthelemy Girard and Father Louis-Theodore Furet, he arrived at Naha, the capital of the Kingdom of Ryukyu on 6 May 1855. During his two years in Okinawa, he was unable to win a single convert; however, during this time he developed a working knowledge of the Japanese language. On his return to Hong Kong, he was recruited by Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros, whom he assisted at Edo with the negotiations cumulating in the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and Japan which was signed on 9 October 1858. On November 1859 he returned to Japan, this time to Hakodate, the main town on the island of Hokkaido where he opened a French-language school of French in April 1860; however, he efforts to open a hospital were frustrated as Russian Orthodox missionaries had arrived first, and had received official blessing to establish a clinic. His efforts as a missionary also met with no success, and disappointed and humiliated, and suffering from ill health, he left Hakodate in 1863. Mermet-Cachon returned to Edo and served as an interpreter for Prince Gustave Duchesne de Bellecourt, who was a strong advocate of the use of force to govern relations with Japan and who supported the French intervention in the 20 July 1863 Bombardment of Shimonoseki.Medzini, Meron. (1971), After returning to France in July 1863, Mermet-Cachon abandoned the Paris Foreign Missions Society, and after renouncing his vows as a Catholic priest, returned to Japan in a private capacity as interpreter to the French diplomat L√©on Roches in April 1864. On 1 April 1865, he established a French language school in Yokohama and took a former prostitute as his common-law wife. He returned to France again on 27 October 1866, apparently with the intention of making only a short stay; however, in 1867, he was requested to serve as an assistant to Tokugawa Akitake, the 14-year-old son of Tokugawa Nariaki, daimy≈ç of Mito Domain, who had arrived as a special envoy of the Tokugawa shogunate for the 1867 World Fair in Paris, where Japan had a pavilion . He also acted as interpreter for Tokugawa Akitake's audience with Napoleon III, which subsequently resulted in strong French support for the Tokugawa shogunate. Mermet-Cachon never returned to Japan, but died in Cannes on 14 March 1889. His grave is at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. ==See also== *Franco- Japanese relations ==References== * Marcouin, Francis, Omoto Keiko (1990) Quand le Japon s'ouvrit au monde (French) Gallimard, Paris: . * Numa Broc, Dictionnaire des explorateurs fran√ßais du XIXe si√®cle, T.2, Asie, CTHS, 1992, * E-E.

On 18 February 2018, during its approach to Yasuj, the aircraft serving the flight, an ATR 72-212, operated by Iran Aseman Airlines crashed into Mount Dena in the Zagros Mountains near Noqol village in Semirom county, Isfahan Province. All 60 passengers and 6 crew members on board were killed. According to the interim report, which was published on 18 February 2019 by the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization (CAO), the accident was caused by multiple factors, with pilot error considered as the main cause. The investigation showed that the crew decided to continue to Yasuj despite the deteriorating weather condition in the area. During its approach, the crew elected to descent below the minimum altitude. The resulting bad weather caused the aircraft to stall. The crew failed to recover the aircraft from the stall and the aircraft crashed onto the mountain. The final report has yet to be released. == Aircraft == The aircraft involved was an ATR 72-212 with MSN 391. It was registered EP-ATS and was delivered to Iran Aseman Airlines in 1993. No serious incidents were recorded during the 24 years of the aircraft's service in the airline. An Iranian source reported that the aircraft had recently resumed operations after being out of service for seven years due to a lack of spare parts and that it had technical problems during a flight some weeks before the crash. It was claimed that an Instagram post from Iran Aseman two months prior to the crash, that announced the aircraft was back in service, had been deleted after it crashed. At the time of the accident, Iran Aseman had six ATR aircraft in its fleet, of which three were in operation. == Passengers and crew == It was initially reported that 59 passengers and six crew members were presumed to be on board. It was later revealed that there were 60 passengers and six crew members aboard. The flight manifest was consisted of 65 adults and 1 child. There were 60 passengers, 2 security guards, 2 flight attendants and 2 flight crew members. The pilot of the flight was identified as 62-year old Hojatollah Foladi. He had accumulated a total flying hours of more than 17,000 hours, of which 12,000 hours were on the type. The pilot also had experience of flying in India from 2002 to 2007, before returning to Iran Aseman Airlines. At least 2 flights to Yasuj had been performed 3 months prior to the accident. His flying certificate was deemed as valid. The pilot not flying was identified as 36-year old First Officer Khevah Khalili with a total flying hours of approximately 1,800 flying hours, of which 197 hours were on the type. == Accident == The aircraft was operating a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Iranian capital Tehran Mehrabad International Airport to Yasuj Airport in Yasuj, the capital of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province in southwest Iran. The flight was supposed to take about 50 minutes. It was operated by Iran Aseman Airlines, the third largest airline in Iran. It took off from Tehran with 60 passengers and 6 crew members at about 04:35 UTC. At 05:49 UTC, as Flight 3704 approached Yasuj, the flight crew asked the meteorological information in Yasuj. Yasuj Tower later informed Flight 3704 about the weather condition and mentioned that the final approach path was clear. The flight later was cleared to descent to FL170 by Tehran and was handed over to Yasuj on 05:53 UTC. The crew stated that they would continue the approach with FL150. At 05:55, the crew reported that they were 25 miles from the destination airport. Yasuj Tower then told the pilot about the updated condition in Yasuj, stating that clouds were slowly moving to the south. Four minutes later, Yasuj asked the flight again and the crew responded that they failed to receive the signal of Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) from their navigational device. The crew then checked about the weather condition in the area again. At 06:04 UTC, Yasuj Tower lost communication contact with Flight 3704. Attempts had been made to re-establish communication with the aircraft but failed. According to flight tracking website Flightradar24, the last signal from the aircraft was received just before 05:56 UTC, when it was at an altitude of and was descending. == Search == Helicopters were deployed to search for the missing aircraft Locals reported that they had heard the aircraft hit the mountain. Iranian authorities in neighboring Shiraz and Isfahan province had deployed two of their helicopters to the crash site. A total of 12 search and rescue teams had been dispatched Mount Dena, but due to foggy conditions, rescue helicopters could not reach the crash site in the Zagros Mountains. Mount Dena, the location of the crash site, is actually a mountain range within the Zagros Mountains; it is long with several peaks, the highest of which is above sea level. Spokesman from Iran Aseman Airlines initially stated that all 66 passengers and crews on board had been killed in the accident. However, this statement was later retracted by the airline and the airline later issued a statement saying that it could not \\"accurately and definitely confirm\\" that everyone had died in the crash. In response to the crash, crisis centres were set up in Tehran, Isfahan, Fars and Yasuj. Weather conditions at the crash site, including snow and strong winds, were hampering search and rescue services. The Red Crescent Society announced that a drone would be flown to the area due to the severe weather condition which prevented helicopters to reach the crash site. Search and rescue team announced on 19 February that at least 5 helicopters had been prepared for the search operation. Troops with search dogs were deployed to hike the mountain and to search the area on foot. Search and rescue operation via air was stopped for the second time due to bad weather conditions. Reports that the wreckage had been found at an elevation of 11,482 feet were refuted by officials from the Iranian Red Crescent and Iranian investigators. On 20 February, two helicopters from Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air Force sighted the wreckage of the aircraft, below the peak of the mountains south of Noqol at an elevation of approximately . Another military helicopter sighted the wreckage and pinpointed the crash site. The aircraft was completely obliterated, with large portion of the tail cone, the vertical stabilizer, the rudder and the empennage were found. Scattered bodies could be seen around the wreckage. No survivors were seen at the crash site. All 60 passengers and 6 crew members on board died. As helicopters were unable to land on the crash site, the recovery of the victims had to be done on foot. Officials stated that the bodies had to be carried on the rescuers' backs to the mountain foot. The head of the country's emergency services said that the recovery of the victims would be challenging due to the adverse weather. As of 21 February, at least 32 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. On 3 March Iranian officials announced they had found the flight recorders. ==Investigation== President of Iran Hassan Rouhani ordered Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Ahmad Akhoundi to lead the investigation. Iran Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) investigated the cause of the crash. The French BEA also sent 7 delegations to investigate the crash. The aircraft's manufacturer, ATR, sent 4 people to Iran to assist with the investigation. The preliminary report issued in March, 2018, states that while the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 15,000 feet, engine power was reduced causing the speed to drop significantly, and causing a descent towards 14,000 feet and causing a stall warning. In the area of the accident the minimum safe altitude was 15,500 feet, the mountains peaked at 14,460 feet and the flight plan called for the aircraft to maintain 17,000 feet. The main cause of accident:The accident was happened due to many chains of considered causes but the ‚ÄúHuman Factor‚Äù had main roll for the conclusion of the scenario. The Cockpit Crew action which has caused dangerous conditions for the flight is considered as main cause. Based on provided evidences as follows: 1- Continuing to the Yasouj airport for landing against Operation manual of the Company, due to low altitude ceiling of the cloud and related cloud mass. They should divert to alternate airport 2- Descending to unauthorized altitude below minimum of the route and MSA, 3- Lack of enough CRM during flight, 4- Failure to complete the stall recovery (flap setting, max RPM), 5- Inappropriate use of Autopilot after Stall condition, 6- Inadequate anticipation for bad weather based on OM (Clouds, Turbulence, and Icing ...), 7- Quick action to switch off anti-ice system and AOA on last minute of the flight, 8- Failure to follow the Check lists and standard call out by both pilots. Contributing Factors:The contributive factors to this accident include but are not limited to the following: 1- the airline was not capable to detect systematic defectives about effectiveness of crew training about: Meteorology, OM, SOP, ... and enough operational supervision on pilot behaviors, 2- The lack of SIGMET about Mountain Wave or Severe Mountain wave, 3- Unclear procedure for stall recovery in FCOM& QRH for type ATR72-212 fleet, 4- Lack of warning in aircraft manuals by manufacturer for flight crew awareness about mountain wave. The investigation committee of the Civil Aviation Organization believed that the pilot had been aware of the lack of proper deicing on the aircraft, so he should not have entered the area with potential icing. However, Iranian judicial authorities and the special committee of the Islamic Consultative Assembly believed that the flight should not have been allowed in the first place, and blamed the Iran Aseman Airlines for the accident. Iranian Parliament investigation report on incident released on May 18, 2020, blamed Iranian Civil Aviation Organization and Aseman Airlines on the incident. The parliament report also accuses the manufacture of the airplane for not providing spare parts for repair of the aircraft. == Aftermath and reactions == Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Khoundi observed the search and rescue operation On 23 February 2018, the Iran Civil Aviation Organization temporarily suspended the operation of Iran Aseman Airlines' ATR 72 aircraft. The search and rescue operation was viewed as \\"too long\\" by some family members, some were angered due to the incompetent handling of the disaster. On 19 February, more than 100 people reportedly protested outside a government building in Dena Kooh, demanding Iranian officials to step down due to the response on the disaster. Journalists have speculated that the economic sanctions against Iran which have prevented Iranian airlines from obtaining new planes and spare parts and forced them to operate aging aircraft may have contributed to the cause of the crash. == See also == * Iran Air Flight 277 * Iran Aseman Airlines Flight 6895 * American Eagle Flight 4184 * Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751 == References == == External links == * *Accident Investigation Report Issued 17 February 2019 * \\"Accident to the ATR72 registered EP-ATS and operated by Aseman Airlines on 18/02/2018 near Yasouj [Investigation led by AAIB / Islamic Republic of Iran]\\" ‚Äì Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile * \\"Accident de l‚ÄôATR72 immatricul√© EP-ATS et exploit√© par Aseman Airlines survenu le 18/02/2018 pr√®s de Yasouj [Enqu√™te men√©e par AAIB / R√©publique Islamique d'Iran]\\" ‚Äì Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile Category:2018 in Iran Category:Accidents and incidents involving the ATR 72 Category:Airlines of Iran accidents and incidents Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Iran Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2018 Category:February 2018 events in Iran Category:Semirom County ","title":"Iran Aseman Airlines Flight 3704"},{"id":"56619457","text":"Yury Rogozov (Russian: –Æ—Ä–∏–π –†–æ–≥–æ–∑–æ–≤; born 8 September 1930) is a Russian rower who represented the Soviet Union.

His father was Joseph Austin James and his mother was Elizabeth Hosten. In 1803, the family went in search of a new home in the West, living in various locations at Kentucky, and Illinois, until reaching Missouri in 1807 near Florissant. During this time, Lewis and Clark returned from their expedition, bringing with them the Mandan Indian Chief Shehaka from the Upper Missouri to visit the \\"Great Father\\" at Washington City. When Louis was appointed Governor of Missouri Territory, he sent Chief Shehaka up the Missouri with an escort of about 40 United States troops under the command of Captain Prior. On their arrival to the country of Rickarees, a warlike Indian tribe attacked the Mandans and killed eight or ten soldiers while the rest retreated with Shehaka to St. Louis. With the formation of the Missouri Fur Company, an expedition was proposed to head up the Missouri and into the Rocky Mountains during Spring of 1809. Governor Lewis contracted with the company to convey the Mandan Chief back to his tribe for the sum of $10,000. Thomas James enlisted in this expedition and the money was raised for trading with the Indians and trapping Beaver along the headwaters of the Missouri and Columbia rivers. The total party consisted of 350 men. After the expedition, he started a career in milling. He purchased Kinney's Mill near the village of New Design in Monroe County, Illinois.

The dorsal anterior mantle margin forms a triangular lobe between the eyes. The wide fines have a wide gap between them at the rear. The males have a hectocotylus on the left ventral arm and this has 1 or 2 rows of normal size suckers at the base, 9 to 13 rows of highly shrunken suckers in the middle part of the arm; these suckers are arranged in 2 dorsal and 2 ventral series which are laterally displaced and are separated by a gap. The suckers on the hectocotylus are covered by a well developed dorsal protective membrane. The tentacular club is straight and slender having 5 or 6 suckers in transverse rows in which a number of the suckers of the inner 2 or 3 rows are larger than rest. The cuttlebone is oblong in shape outline roughly rectangular; tapering to a point anteriorly and rounded and blunt posteriorly. Its dorsal surface is evenly convex and covered with a sculpture of calcareous granulose arranged in a net like pattern which have their greatest concentration in the middle of the bone and at the long edges where they are arranged in irregular ridges parallel to the margin. The bone is most calcified at the rear and there is an indistincr dorsal median rib which broadens slightly towards the head end. The lateral and anterior margins of the cuttlebone are covered in chitin. On the dorsal part of the mantle there are a series of elongate papillae on either flank, situated around halfway along the base of the fins. It is purplish brown in colour with a zebra-like striping on the arms and an orange-red pigmented stripe which runs along their outer surface. The dorsal mantle has small spots, mainly towards the rear, and narrow, cream-coloured, broken lines running across it. The fins are pale and in the males there is a thin, shiny orange-pink stripe along the fin base of males which is bordered by a purplish band and 1 or 2 rows of many short bars which run along it. ==Distribution== Sepia bertheloti occurs along the western coast of Africa from Western Sahara south to Angola, it is also found off the Canary Islands. ==Habitat and ecology== Sepia bertheloti is found at depths of between 20m and 156m, being most numerous off the Canary Islands from depths of 70m-140m. At the Endeavour Bank they migrate to shallower waters on order to spawn in the summer and autumn. Their size distribution, as measured from animals caught by fisheries, shows a wider variation than for the sympatric Sepia officinalis during the summer. This wider variation suggests that either the spawning season is extended or at least some spawning happens continuously. ==Fisheries== Sepia bertheloti is fished for by trawling off the Canary Islands and is commonly captured off the western Endeavour Bank.

Although the One Dimension Group was founded in Iraq, its members originated from across Arab nations, and its influence was felt across the Arab art world. ==Background== One Dimension is one of a number of art groups that formed in 20th-century Iraq. During the first world war, a small group of European officers and artists settled in Iraq, exposing young artists to Western art traditions and techniques.Davis, E., Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq, University of California Press, 2005, p. 82 While local artists and middle classes developed an appreciation for European art, the arts community searched for ways of synthesising indigenous art with international trends.

See section M12 Each of these groups developed different ideas about how to combine heritage and modernity and developed a different vision for a national art aesthetic. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups,Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 79 -80 collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War, Syracuse University Press, 2013, p. 22 Of these art groups, the Baghdad Modern Art Group and the One Dimension Group are the most frequently cited. ==Brief history and philosophy== The One Dimension Group was established formally in 1971 by the prominent Baghdadi artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said, when he published a manifesto for the group.The manifesto was published in the Iraqi newspaper, al-Jamhuriyyah, issue no. 880, p. 8; See: Shabout, N.,\\"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension,\\" Nafas Art Magazine, May, 2008, Online: Al Said had previously been a founding member of the Baghdad Group for Modern Art (Jama'at Baghdad lil-Fann al-Hadith) together with Jawad Saleem (1919-1961) and Jabra Ibrahim Jabra (1919-1994), but he along with several high profile artists, had withdrawn from that group when it lost its sense of direction, following the death of its founder, Jawad Saleem in 1961.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 51-52 The One Dimension manifesto gives voice to the group's commitment to both heritage and modernity and sought to distance itself from the modern Arab artists which they perceived as following European artistic traditions.Mejcher-Atassi, S., \\"Shakir Hassan Al Said,\\" in Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir- Hassan-Al-Said.aspx One Dimension's objectives are complex and sophisticated; it is philosophy, technique, style and a relationship between time and space, between the visual and the non-visual.Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109M The \\"one dimension\\" is an oblique reference to Sufism, which has been described as \\"the inner dimension of Islam.\\"Titus Burckhardt, Art of Islam: Language and Meaning (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2009), p. 223 The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. At the most basic level, the group rejected two and three-two dimensional artwork in favour of a single \\"inner dimension\\". This approach was influenced by both the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and the traditions of Arabic calligraphy and associated Sufi movements. In practice, a single inner dimension was difficult to realise because most artworks are produced on two-dimensional surfaces.Lack, J., Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.

The incorporation of callij (calligraphy) letters into modern artworks was an important aspect of this relationship.

Medically- proven carcinogenic parasites are three species of flukes (trematodes), namely the urinary blood fluke (Schistosoma haematobium), the Southeast Asian liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini) and the Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis). S. haematobium is prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, and is the leading cause of bladder cancer (only next to tobacco smoking). O. viverrini and C. sinensis are both found in eastern and southeastern Asia, and are responsible for cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile ducts). The International Agency for Research on Cancer declared them in 2009 as a Group 1 biological carcinogens in humans. Other parasites are also linked to various cancers. Among protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium parvum, Trichomonas vaginalis and Theileria are associated with specific cancer cells. Plasmodium falciparum can also be an indirect cause of cancer. Tapeworms such as Echinococcus granulosus and Taenia solium may directly or indirectly cause cancer. Liver flukes such as Opisthorchis viverrini and Platynosomum fastosum can cause cancer in domesticated animals. Roundworms such as Strongyloides stercoralis, Heterakis gallinarum, and Trichuris muris are known to cause cancer in animals. ==History== A rat roundworm Gongylonema neoplasticum was the first parasite discovered‚Äîallegedly‚Äîto cause cancer. A Danish physician Johannes Fibiger discovered it in 1907, and experimentally showed that he could induce stomach cancer in rats using the roundworm infection in 1913. In 1914, he gave the name Spiroptera (Gongylonema) neoplastica, but later changed it to Spiroptera carcinoma. Fibiger won the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for his discovery of the Spiroptera carcinoma\\". However, his interpretation was later found to be false, and that the roundworm was not carcinogenic on its own. Fibiger's Nobel Prize was described as \\"one of the biggest blunders made by the Karolinska Institute.\\" The first true carcinogenic parasite discovered was Schistosoma haematobium. Theodor Maximillian Bilharz, a German physician at the Kasr el-Aini Hospital in Cairo recovered the adult fluke from a dead soldier in 1851. He named it Distomum haematobium. The disease is often called bilharzia in honour of the discoverer. The infectivity and life cycle was discovered by Scottish physician Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915. A British Surgeon Reginald Harrison, at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, was the first to note its role in cancer. In 1889, he found that four people out of five cancer victims had bilharzia. A German physician Carl Goebel confirmed in 1903 that bladder tumour occurred in most bilharzia patients. By 1905, he was convinced that carcinoma of bladder was due to bilharzia. ==Group 1 carcinogens in human== Three flukes, urinary blood fluke (Schistosoma haematobium), Southeast Asian liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini) and Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis) are classified as Group 1 carcinogens, i.e. they are substantiated and directly cancer-causing agents. ===Schistosoma haematobium=== S. haematobium is a digenetic trematode found in Africa and the Middle East. It is the major agent of schistosomiasis, the most prevalent parasitic infection in humans. It is the only blood fluke that infects the urinary tract, causing urinary schistosomiasis, and is the leading cause of bladder cancer (only next to tobacco smoking). Its life cycle is transmission between humans and freshwater snail, species of Bulinus. The larvae live in water bodies from where they infect the hosts by penetrating the skin. Adults are found in the venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs travels to the wall of the urine bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys (hydronephrosis). Inflammation of the genitals due to S. haematobium may contribute to the propagation of HIV. Antigens produced by the eggs induce granuloma formation. Granulomata in turn coalesce to form tubercles, nodules or masses that often ulcerate. This creates the pathological lesions found in the bladder wall, ureter and renal; and also tumour, both benign and malignant. ===Opisthorchis viverrini=== O. viverrini is a food-borne liver fluke that mainly attacks the area of the bile duct. Infection with the parasite, called opisthorchiasis is the major cause of cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts, in northern Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Vietnam and Cambodia. O. viverrini has three successive host for its life cycle ‚Äì the first intermediate hosts are freshwater snails of the genus Bithynia, the second intermediate hosts are different cyprinid fish, and humans are the definitive hosts. Generally opisthorchiasis due to O. viverrini is harmless without any clinical symptoms, but in rare cases, cholangitis, cholecystitis, and cholangiocarcinoma can develop. O. viverrini invades the bile ducts and, rarely, the gall bladder and pancreatic duct. Heavy infection can produce problems such as fibrosis in the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts. Pathological effects on the bile ducts including inflammation, epithelial desquamation, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial and adenomatous hyperplasia and periductal fibrosis collectively promote cholangiocarcinoma. Though it is not immediately life-threatening, cancer develops after 30‚Äì40 years, and the ensuing death is rapid‚Äîwithin 3‚Äì6 months of diagnosis. ===Clonorchis sinensis=== C. sinensis is also a food-borne liver fluke. It is the most prevalent human trematode in Asia, and is found in Korea, China, Vietnam and also Russia. 85% of the cases are found in China. It is transmitted similarly to O. viverrini, but the species of snails are varied, of which Parafossarulus manchouricus is the most common. The cyprinid fish hosts are also different. General clonorchiasis is indicated with fatigue, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, liver cirrhosis and jaundice. The most severe infections cause cholangiocarcinoma and hepatic carcinoma. ==Indirect or putative carcinogens== Infection with malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is classified by IARC as probable (Group 2A) carcinogen. Schistosoma japonicum is a possible (Group 2B) carcinogen. There is a close association between the cat liver fluke Opisthorchis felineus and bile duct cancer among people in Russia. Toxoplasma gondii and eye cancer (intraocular lymphoma) was detected by PCR from two human cases. Strongyloides stercoralis eggs and adult worms may be linked with gastric adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma in Korea. Cryptosporidium parvum infection is associated with colorectal carcinoma. ==Carcinogens in animals== The roundworm Trichuris muris infection can increase the number of tumours in mice. Heavy infection with the trematode Platynosomum fastosum is associated with cholangiocarcinoma in cats. Cryptosporidium parvum infection can be the cause of carcinoma in the gut of mice. ==References== Category:Parasitic diseases Category:Infectious causes of cancer Category:Helminthiases Category:Helminthology ","title":"Carcinogenic parasite"},{"id":"56619915","text":"Mandal Parishad Primary School or Mandal Parishad Upper Primary School is the name of many Government Primary Schools in India and most particularly in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

The match was played at Croke Park in Dublin on 2 September 2018. It was the second time the teams had met in the final; Dublin won the first encounter in 1995. The final was shown live in Ireland on RT√â Two as part of The Sunday Game live programme, presented by Michael Lyster from Croke Park, with studio analysis from Joe Brolly, Pat Spillane, and Colm O'Rourke. Match commentary was provided by Ger Canning with analysis by Dessie Dolan. The game was also shown live on Sky Sports, presented by Rachel Wyse and Brian Carney. Dublin won the final by a margin of six points, on a scoreline of 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì14. The victory was Dublin's fourth consecutive All-Ireland title, making them the third county to win \\"four-in-a-row\\" (the others are Wexford in 1915‚Äì18 and Kerry in 1929‚Äì32 and 1978‚Äì81). This was the last occasion on which Michael Lyster presented RT√â's television coverage, having decided to retire from The Sunday Game at the end of 2018. ==Paths to the final== ===Dublin=== ====Leinster Championship==== Dublin won the Leinster Championship and so advanced directly to the quarter-final group stage. ====All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (Super 8s)==== Dublin finished first in Group 2 and advanced to the All- Ireland semi-final, to play the team who placed second in Group 1 - Galway. ====All-Ireland Semi-Final==== ===Tyrone=== ====Ulster Championship==== Having been beaten by Monaghan, Tyrone were eliminated from the Ulster championship and entered Round 1 of the All-Ireland qualifiers. ====All-Ireland Qualifiers==== ====All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (Super 8s)==== Tyrone finished second in Group 2, behind Dublin, and advanced to the All-Ireland semi-final, to play the winner of Group 2, Monaghan. ====All-Ireland Semi- Final==== ==Pre-match== The match had originally been scheduled for 26 August, but had to be moved to accommodate the visit of Pope Francis to Ireland, where he attended the World Meeting of Families. The final had been moved from its traditional date of the third Sunday of September to allow more time for club matches. ===Tyrone's RT√â boycott=== On Monday 20 August 2018, just under two weeks before the final, the Irish Independent reported that RT√â had confirmed that Tyrone would not be involved in any media coverage with the national broadcaster surrounding the event. The boycott, considered a tradition at this stage in relation to Tyrone, involved for the first time an All-Ireland final, after which RT√â airs television coverage from the hotel in which the winning team is booked to stay. This meant that, in the event of a Tyrone win, RT√â would be unable to cover the after-match events as per usual, including interviews on the pitch with players and the management team. Tyrone's All- Ireland final boycott was a continuation of a seven-year blacklisting of RT√â by the county, the cause of which was a radio sketch aired in 2011 on RT√â Radio 1. The sketch incensed Tyrone, as it was deemed to be mocking Michaela Harte (daughter of Tyrone manager Mickey Harte), shortly after she was murdered while on honeymoon in Mauritius. Former All-Ireland winning captain Peter Canavan suggested the timing of RT√â's announcement was intended to put pressure on Tyrone. ===Minor final=== Kerry played Galway in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship final which took place before the senior final. Kerry won the game on a 0‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì14 scoreline to complete a five in a row of All Ireland wins. ===Jubilee team=== The Derry team that won the 1993 All- Ireland Final were presented to the crowd before the senior match to mark 25 years. ==Match== ===Officials=== On 20 August, Cork's Conor Lane was confirmed as the referee for the final. He was previously in charge of the drawn final between Dublin and Mayo in 2016. ===Team news=== Tyrone made one change to the team from the semi-final win over Monaghan with Mark Bradley starting ahead of Lee Brennan. Despite fears of an injury to Cian O'Sullivan, Dublin named an unchanged side, with the same starting fifteen that overcame Galway three weeks earlier. ===Summary=== Dublin began the game unchanged with Tyrone making 2 late changes - Rory Brennan and Conor Meyler replaced Frank Burns and Richie Donnelly. Prior to the game, Dublin, as reigning All-Ireland champions for three consecutive years, were heavy favourites to win. They took an early lead after Dean Rock scored a free, but he put his next two efforts wide, allowing Tyrone to assert dominance for fifteen minutes. During this timeframe, the Ulster team opened up a four-point lead, with the score poised at 0‚Äì05 to 0‚Äì01 in favour of Mickey Harte's side. However, the tide of the game turned once more in a dramatic, as Paul Mannion was fouled in Tyrone's penalty box, leading Conor Lane to award a penalty to Dublin, which Mannion calmly slotted home. Coupled with another successful free from Rock, this left the teams equal with five points apiece. Tyrone only managed to secure one more point in the remaining twenty-four minutes of the half, and their lack of clinicality in front of goal opened the door to a resurgent Dublin side. In the twenty-eighth minute, Dublin pulled further ahead courtesy of another goal. Con O'Callaghan took the ball deep into Tyrone territory before offloading to Niall Scully, who calmly fisted it into Niall Morgan's unguarded net. Thus, the teams headed in at half-time with Dublin seven points to the good, having racked up 2‚Äì07 to Tyrone's 0‚Äì06. While Tyrone reduced the deficit by two early in the second half, with points from Connor McAliskey and Kieran McGeary narrowing Dublin's margin somewhat, the team in blue, affectionately known as \\"the Dubs\\", had accumulated an unassailable lead. The second thirty- five minutes were not entirely without incident, however; Dublin had pulled further out of sight, with points from Ciaran Kilkenny and Brian Fenton further diminishing whatever minuscule chances Tyrone had at mounting a comeback. However, in the sixty-sixth minute, Tyrone were given a late opportunity to draw near again, as Philly McMahon brought down Colm Cavanagh with a rash challenge, granting Tyrone a penalty - this was coolly dispatched by Peter Harte, breaching Stephen Cluxton's net for the first time in the game. Later, John Small was given a second yellow card, and ergo sent off, leaving Dublin to finish with just fourteen men. Ultimately, a point at the death from Kevin McManamon put the victory beyond any doubt. Conor Lane, the County Cork native, blew the final whistle, confirming Dublin's victory with a margin of six points. The final score was 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì14. The man of the match award was bestowed upon Jack McCaffrey, who received the award ahead of his other nominated teammates, Kilkenny and Mannion. As captain, goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton, making his 200th appearance for the county, lifted the Sam Maguire Cup aloft from the Hogan Stand. The win represented Dublin's fourth consecutive win under the management of Jim Gavin, a feat only previously achieved by two other counties - Kerry and Wexford. It also further extended Dublin's unbeaten run in the Championship; the side was last beaten in 2014. ===Details=== { width=92%  -   } { style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1 Stephen Cluxton (c) - CB 2 Philly McMahon  - FB 3 Cian O'Sullivan  - CB 4 Eoin Murchan  - WB 5 John Small  - HB 6 Jonny Cooper  - WB 7 Jack McCaffrey  - MF 8 Brian Fenton  - MF 9 James McCarthy  - WF 10 Niall Scully  - HF 11 Con O'Callaghan  - FW 12 Brian Howard - CF 13 Paul Mannion  - FF 14 Ciar√°n Kilkenny  - CF 15 Dean Rock  - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 16 Evan Comerford  - FW 17 Paddy Andrews - FW 18 Colm Basquel  - FW 19 Cormac Costello  - DF 20 Darren Daly  - DF 21 Michael Fitzsimons  - FW 22 Paul Flynn  - DF 23 Eric Lowndes  - MF 24 Michael Darragh MacAuley  - FW 25 Kevin McManamon  - FW 26 Eoghan O'Gara  - colspan=3 Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"Jim Gavin } style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1 Niall Morgan  - CB 2 Michael McKernan  - FB 3 Ronan McNamee  - CB 4 P√°draig Hampsey  - WB 5 Tiernan McCann  - HB 18 Rory Brennan  - WB 7 Peter Harte  - MF 8 Colm Cavanagh  - MF 9 Cathal McShane  - WF 10 Mattie Donnelly (c)  - HF 11 Niall Sludden  - WF 12 Kieran McGeary  - CF 13 Mark Bradley  - FF 25 Conor Meyler  - CF 15 Connor McAliskey  - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 16 Michael O'Neill  - DF 6 Frank Burns  - FW 14 Richard Donnelly - FW 17 Lee Brennan  - DF 19 Michael Cassidy  - FW 20 Harry Loughran  - MF 21 Conal McCann  - FW 22 Declan McClure  - DF 23 Aidan McCrory  - DF 24 HP McGeary  - FW 26 Ronan O'Neill  - colspan=3 Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"Mickey Harte - } - } { width=100% style=\\"font- size: 100%\\"  Man of the Match: Jack McCaffrey } ===Trophy presentation=== Dublin captain Stephen Cluxton accepted the Sam Maguire Cup from GAA president John Horan in the Hogan Stand. ===Reaction=== Highlights of the final were shown on The Sunday Game programme which aired at 9:30 pm that night on RT√â Two and was presented by Des Cahill.

He enlisted in the AIF aged 24 in August 1915. He joined the 32 Bttn. in their 3rd reinforcement and embarked from Adelaide on HMAT A28 Militiades in February 1916. On the Western Front he was promoted to Copooral and he served with the 32nd Bttn Frank Cummings at the AIF project Cummings was wounded twice during World War I. In May 1917, surgeons had to remove bomb splinters from his back and legs after being sent on patrol to determine whether the Germans were withdrawing from the Hindenburg Line, then a year later he suffered severe burns after a mustard gas attack. He returned to Australia in December 1918. Later in life his wounds would see him confined to a wheelchair ==Club and state rowing== Post- war Cummings was employed as a fireman on the South Australian Railways and in 1920 he joined the Murray Bridge Rowing Club where his brother Robert was the coxswain of the club's senior men's eight. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They had won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and for the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Frank Cummings secured the seven seat in the Murray Bridge eight of 1922 and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1922 and 1923,. ==International representative rowing== In 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim for national Olympic selection could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Cummings and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed \\"the Murray Cods\\". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour some of the crew (including Cummings) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924. In the Olympic regatta, with Cummings in the seven seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Frank Cummings continued on as a first-class oarsman after the Olympics. He was again seated at seven in the South Australian representative eight's King's Cup campaign of 1925 (fourth place).1925 Interstate Regatta ==References== Category:1891 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Australian male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Australia Category:Rowers at the 1924 Summer Olympics ","title":"Frank Cummings"},{"id":"56619972","text":"Emily McGuire (born 12 January 1999) is an Australian rules footballer who played for the Fremantle Football Club in the AFL Women's (AFLW).

A petition was lodged, and a committee decided the returning officer had no right to cast the vote and should have declared both candidates elected.

The clay is mixed with sand, water, and fiber, typically wood fiber, and sometimes other additives like starch.Criterias for clay board certification, 2015 (natureplus.org) Most often this means employing the use of high-cellulose waste fibres. To improve the breaking resistance clay boards are often embedded in a hessian skin on the backside or similar embeddings. By introducing the clay panels, the building material loam can also be used in dry construction. Clay wallboards are a sustainable alternative to gypsum plasterboards, suitable for drywall applications for interior walls and ceilings. It can be applied to either timber or metal studwork. Usually the application of clay boards is completed with clay finishing plaster.Sandy Patience: Sustainability in Practice: Unfired Clay Products The Architect's Journal, 2010 == Constructional properties == The boards have fire retardant properties and medium levels of acoustic insulation. Due to the clay component they have the ability to absorb large amounts of humidity through the plaster and helping to protect vulnerable buildings from excess moisture generated by modern living. Board Options for Clayworks Plasters (clay-works.com) == Production == Clay panels are available from different manufacturers in different designs. The main component is clay or loam. This is either reinforced by a reed mat or stabilised by straw or wood fibres (sawdust) as with clay bricks. Further vegetable or mineral aggregates may also be contained. The boards are not heat-treated, so that the positive characteristics of the clay remain in its entirety. == Processing == Clay panels are used for the dry construction of wall and ceiling claddings and facing shells. The boards are mounted on a steel profile or wooden frame construction by means of screws or nails. For ceiling claddings, washers must be used depending on the type of clay panel. The panels can be sawn with standard tools, like a cutter knife, a jigsaw or a circular saw. The joints of the clay boards often have tongue and groove for easier processing. The joints must be reinforced with a jute fabric or glass fibre fabric and filled with a fine clay plaster mortar. The clay board is mounted in vertical or horizontal form. The clay building wall or ceiling can then be treated with a clay plaster or painted directly with clay paint. == Combination with heating and cooling == Clay is an ideal construction material for combinations with heating and cooling. Before the development of drywall panels made of clay, however, wall heating elements could only be laid in clay plaster. Meanwhile, some manufacturers offer clay building boards with integrated heating and cooling pipes. This makes the installation of heating and cooling in dry construction on walls and ceilings much easier. == Applications == * Interior wall and ceiling board * Area separation wall board * Backer board and underlayment * Substrates for coatings and insulated systems * Clay Climate Systems == See also == * Enviroboard * Magnesium oxide wallboard ==References== Category:Building materials Category:Sustainable building Category:Sustainable architecture Category:Building biology Category:Composite materials Category:Passive fire protection Category:Wallcoverings ","title":"Clay panel"},{"id":"56620192","text":"The Hurufiyya movement ( ·∏•urufiyyah, adjectival form ·∏•urufƒ´, literally \\"letters [of the alphabet]\\") is an aesthetic movement that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century amongst Arab artists, who used their understanding of traditional Islamic calligraphy within the precepts of modern art. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a culture specific visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the Hurufi, an approach of Sufism which emerged in the late 14th‚Äìearly 15th century. Art historian Sandra Dagher has described Hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in Arabic art in the 20th century. ==Definition== The term, hurifiyya is derived from the Arabic term, harf which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe a contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.Mir-Kasimov, O., Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam, I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015 Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning.Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 p. 115 The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the Al-hurufiyyah movementAli, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 16 or the Letrism movementIssa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,New York, Merrill, 2016) refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work.Mavrakis, N., \\"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online: ;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., A-Z Great Modern Artists, Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56 The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the Letterist International which had an Algerian section founded in Chlef in 1953 by Hadj Mohamed Dahou. The term, hurufiyya has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including Wijdan Ali, Nada Shabout and Karen Dabrowska. An alternative term, al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80; Shabout, N., \\"Huroufiyah\\" in: Routledge Encyclopedia Of Modern Art, Routledge, 2016, DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REM176-1; Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67 ==Brief history and philosophy== An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth, page from a Sufi manuscript, 13th century. Sufi art served as part of the inspiration for the al-hurufiyya movement. Traditional calligraphic art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined it to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts.Schimmel, A., Calligraphy and Islamic Culture, London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32 Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists, however, broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 p. 3 The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions.Dadi. I., \\"Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective,\\" South Atlantic Quarterly, 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G.

(eds) A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 Some scholars have suggested that Madiha Omar, who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 pp 115-119 However, other scholars have suggested that she was a precursor to Hurufiyya.Anima Gallery, \\"Madiha Omar,\\" [Biographical Notes], Online: Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of Ibrahim el- Salahi,Mavrakis, N., \\"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online:;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., A-Z Great Modern Artists, Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions.Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., The Modernist World, Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., \\"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online:; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., A-Z Great Modern Artists, Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56 The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117 Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art:Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 p. 3 : \\"They deconstruct writing, exploit the letter and turn it into an indexical sign of calligraphy, tradition and cultural heritage. As the sign is purely aesthetic, and only linguistic in its cultural association, it opens hitherto untravelled avenues for interpretation, and attracts different audiences, yet still maintains a link to the respective artist's own culture... Hurufiyya artists do away with the signifying function of language. The characters become pure signs, and temporarily emptied of their referential meaning, they become available for new meanings.\\" The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, Mahmoud Taha, who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship,Asfour, M., \\"A Window on Contemporary Arab Art,\\" NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/ and sculptors, such as the Qatari, Yousef AhmadAnima Gallery, \\"Yousef Ahdmad,\\" [Biographical Notes], Online: and the Iraqi sculptors, Jawad Saleem and Mohammed Ghani Hikmat. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's Al Bu'd al Wahad (or the One Dimension Group)\\" which published a manifesto,\\"Shaker Hassan Al Said,\\" Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., \\"Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective,\\" South Atlantic Quarterly. Vol. 109, No. 3, 2010, pp 555-576, DOI: 10.1215/00382876-2010-006 Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. However, the Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither \\"a movement nor a school.\\"Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200 ===Evolution of hurufiyya=== Ashaar Baghdad (Baghdad's poetry) by Mohammed Ghani Hikmat. In this fountain, Arabic words taken from a poem by Mustafa Jamal El Din have been squeezed together to form the oval shape in an example of abstract calligraphy. Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists:Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,New York, Merrill, 2016 : First generation: The pioneers, who inspired by the independence of their nations, searched for a new aesthetic language that would allow them to express their nationalism. These artists rejected European techniques and media, turning to indigenous media and introducing Arabic calligraphy into their art. For this group of artists, Arabic letters are a central feature of the artwork. First generation artists include: the Jordanian artist, Princess Wijdan Ali, the Sudanese artist, Ibrahim el-Salahi; the Iraqi artists, Shakkir Hassan Al Sa'id, Jamil Hamoudi and Jawad Saleem; the Lebanese painter and poet, Etel Adnan and the Egyptian artist, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926). : Second generation: Artists, most of whom live in exile, but reference their traditions, culture and language in their artworks. The artist, Dia Azzawi is typical of this generation. : Third generation: Contemporary artists who have absorbed international aesthetics, and who employ Arabic and Persian script occasionally. They deconstruct the letters, and use them in a purely abstract and decorative manner. The work of Golnaz Fathi and Lalla Essaydi is representative of the third generation. ==Types of hurufiyya art== Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of \\"explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters.\\"Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200 Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art.Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, pp 79-85 Ali identifies the following, which she describes as schools within the movement:Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165; Daghir uses a different classification, not canvassed here. ; Pure calligraphy : Artworks in which calligraphy forms both the background and the foreground.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165 ; Neoclassical : Works that adhere to the rules of 13th-century calligraphy. An example of this is the work of Khairat Al- Saleh (b. 1940)Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165 Artist, Dia-Al-Azzawi, exhibits the style of the Calligraphy Combinations School of Hurufiyya art ; Modern classical : Works that blend pure calligraphy with other motifs, such as repeating geometric patterns. Ahmad Moustaffa (b. 1943) is representative of this styleAli, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165-66 ;Calligraffiti : Artwork, employing script, but which follows no rules and where artists require no formal training. Calligraffiti artists employ their own ordinary handwriting within a modern composition. Artists may reshape letters, or simply invent new letters that reference traditional Arabic scripts. Artists that belong to this school include: Lebanese painter and poet, Etel Adnan; Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi artist and intellectual. Shakir Hassan Al Said.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167-69 ; Freeform calligraphy : Artworks that balance classical styles with calligraffiti.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170 ; Abstract calligraphy : Art that deconstructs letters and includes them as a graphic element in an abstract artwork. In this style of art, letters may be legible, illegible or may use pseudo-script. Rafa al-Naisiri (b. 1940) and Mahmoud Hammad (1923-1988) are notable examples of this style of artist.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170-172 ; Calligraphy Combinations : Artworks that use any combination of calligraphy styles, often employing marginal calligraphy or unconscious calligraphy. Artist, Dia Azzawi is a representative of this style.Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 88 ==Examples== File:Ceiling of Frere Hall.jpgRoof of Frere Hall, Karachi, Pakistan, c. 1986.

Both Omar and Hamoudi joined the One Dimension Group when it was founded by Shakir Hassan Al Said in 1971 since its principles were based on the importance of the Arabic letter.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52 The artist and art historian, Princess Wijdan Ali, who developed the traditions of Arabic calligraphy in a modern, abstract format and is considered a pioneer of the movement in Jordan, has been able to bring hurufiyya to the attention of a broader audience through her writing and her work as a curator and patron of the arts.; Ramadan, K.D., Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Mavrakis, N., \\"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online: Notable exponents of hurufiyya art include:Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G.

The condition is a part of the PIK3CA related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). The disease is congenital and non-hereditary. First described by Slavin and colleagues in 1983. For this disease the mutation causes overgrowth of half of the face (hemifacial). It affects both soft and hard tissue (facial skeleton). The condition is noticeable at birth by the asymmetrical cheeks, with one cheek being prominently larger than the other. == Signs & symptoms == Congenital hemifacial enlargement in which mature lipocytes invade adjacent tissue. Phenotypic features include soft-tissue and skeletal hypertrophy and regional macrodontia. The manifestation are variable ranging from mild to severe. The overgrowth is typically present at birth. The most common features, all features on only one affected side of the face, are: * Increased adipose tissue compared to the other side. The fat is infiltrating with no clear separation from the adjacent tissue. * Hypertrophy of the skeleton including teeth. * Early eruption of ipsilateral deciduous and permanent teeth * The parotid and submandibular gland including accessory tissue is larger. * Epidermal nevus / nevus sebaceous on the affected side. * Increased adipose tissue behind the orbital and pterygopalatine fossa. * Amblyopia of the eye. * Overgrowth of the ear. * Mucosal neuromas * Cutaneous capillary blush * Ipsilateral macroglossia * Syndromic hemimegalencaphaly Not all patients with facial infiltrating lipomatosis have all these symptoms. == Cause == Mutations in the PIK3CA gene have been identified as the cause for facial infiltrating lipomatosis. The mutation is de novo and mosaic meaning it's new, not inherited and not occurring in every cell. One of the DNA nucleotides was altered, causing a change in the amino acid put being into the protein, referred to as a missense mutation, and for PROS, this gives an overactivity, \\"gain-of-function\\". The gene is a part of PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway, a pathway crucial to cell growth, survival, angiogenesis and proliferation. Illustration of the PIK3CA Related Overgrowth Spectrum ==Diagnosis== == Treatment == There is no cure for FIL/PROS. Management usually consists of multiple debulking surgeries and/or drug treatment. Due to the infiltrating fat in important facial structures complete excision of the overgrowth is often impossible and there is a high risk of regrowth after resection. The current drug treatment options are either a mTOR inhibitor, a pan AKT (AKT1-2-3) inhibitor or a PIK3CA inhibitor. The mTOR inhibitor is an off-label use, the use of the AKT-inhibitor is currently in a clinical trial (MOSAIC) and the PIK3CA inhibitor is only available through compassionate use program (if one is eligible). == References == Category:Genetic syndromes Category:Rare diseases ","title":"Facial infiltrating lipomatosis"},{"id":"56620326","text":"Tajikistan Football League Organization (Tajiki: –õ–∏–≥–∞–∏ —Ñ—É—Ç–±–æ–ª–∏ –¢–æ“∑–∏–∫–∏—Å—Ç–æ–Ω) ‚Äî is a Tajikistani public sports football organization, founded in 2012.

He returned to Britain with his mother in 1841, and was then educated by a private tutor at Edinburgh Academy, and then, between 1849 and 1853, at Cheltenham College with his brother Frank. Intended by his father to join the Indian Civil Service, Wyllie obtained a nomination by his uncle William Hutt to attend the University of Oxford, ultimately winning an open scholarship at Trinity College in 1854, and resigning another he had gained at Lincoln College in 1853. He graduated in 1855 with a first class in moderations, and then passed the examination for the Indian Civil Service. On furlough from 1864 to 1865, he returned to Trinity College to sit his examinations, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1864, and a Master of Arts in 1868. ==Indian civil service== Wyllie followed in his father's footsteps, joining the Bombay Presidency, and a 'competition-wallah', moving to India in November 1856. He then became, in January 1858, a third assistant political agent in Kathiawar, before in June, nearly dying of Gujarat fever, which permanently impaired his health. During this period, Wyllie translated Colonel Lang's Mulk Sherista into English and also served as an assistant commissioner in Barabanki district and Lucknow. He then became an assistant secretary to Sir George Yule in 1862, also acting as chief commissioner of the province, and in May 1862 became Calcutta Secretariat upon the recommendation of Sir Henry Marion Durand. In 1866, he was made an under-secretary to the foreign department, becoming an exponent of foreign policy in an article, The foreign policy of Lord Lawrence, which extolled the governor-general's policy. When published in the Edinburgh Review in January 1867, he influenced public opinion, bringing the phrase 'masterly inactivity' into the common lexicon.s:Dictionary of Indian Biography/Wyllie, John William Shaw In his final days in India, Wyllie arranged the grand durbar at Agra in November 1866. ==Return to Britain== A deterioration in health, caused by his earlier Gujarat fever, forced Wyllie to return home in 1867 and, upon persuasion by his uncle, Sir William Hutt, he gave up his Indian career to enter home politics. He was elected MP for Hereford in 1868, standing on a platform of Irish disestablishment and secular education. During the election, he resigned from the Indian service, worrying he would be disqualified for holding an office of profit under the crown. However, Wyllie was shortly after unseated in March 1869, after the Conservative rivals had alleged bribery and treating. Indeed, the election was declared void on petition, after the Liberal agent was found to have \\"given breakfast to Liberal electors\\", and therefore was guilty of treating. Wyllie did no re-stand in the resulting by-election, lamenting that \\"he had foresaken the Indian service for a career that now sunk under him; he had burned his ships and could not return\\". ==Later life and death== Wyllie continued to write after his failed election, including Masterly inactivity, published by The Fortnightly Review in December 1869, defending Lawrence's non-interventionist policy towards Afghanistan and opposing occupation of Quetta, Pakistan; and Mischievous activity, published also The Fortnightly Review in March 1870, criticising Lord Mayo's more interventionist external policy. Wyllie also contributed to the Cornhill Magazine, the Edinburgh Review, and the Calcutta Review, and wrote letters for The Times and publications focused on central Asia. On 2 June 1869, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) for Indian Services and, in January 1870, he moved to Paris to improve his French and study French politics. While there, he suffered from a cold, then inflammation of the lungs and recurred malarial fever, before dying aged 34 at the H√¥tel Vouillemont on 15 March 1870. He was temporarily interred at Montmartre, before his remains were moved to Kensal Green Cemetery. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:1835 births Category:1870 deaths Category:Companions of the Order of the Star of India Category:UK MPs 1868‚Äì1874 ","title":"John Wyllie (politician)"},{"id":"56620701","text":"Balilla may refer to: *Balilla, the nickname of Giovan Battista Perasso, a Genoese boy who started the revolt of 1746 against the Habsburg forces that occupied the city *Fiat Balilla, a compact car designed and developed by Fiat in 1932 *Italian submarine Balilla *Balilla Lombardi, an Italian professional football player ","title":"Balilla (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56620706","text":"Nereide may refer to: *Italian submarine Nereide *Nereide (horse) ==See also== *Nereid (disambiguation) ","title":"Nereide"},{"id":"56620711","text":"Daniel Miller (1825-1888) was a 19th-century Scottish civil engineer and inventor remembered as a harbour and bridge-builder. ==Life== Albert Bridge, Glasgow (detail) South Portland Street Suspension Bridge Partick Bridge Princes Pier, Greenock He was born on 9 January 1825 the son of Isabella Paul and Stephen Miller, a coppersmith and brassfounder, living and working at 48 Saracens Lane in Glasgow.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1825.

These seamounts are home to a variety of marine life including deep-sea sharks (such as the Bluntnose sixgill shark Hexanchus griseus, rays, wreckfish, conger eels, gadellas, escolars, roughies and other species of fish that occur in the extensive areas of sponges, gorgonians and corals. They contain the most southerly known beds of the glass sponges Asconema setubalense. Images taken from an ROV show that these seamounts have rocky and sandy sea beds which are volcanic in origin and that they contain numerous caves, overhangs and cracks which shelter a variety of animals. These seamounts may be rich in certain minerals and the crust is rich in cobalt, as sampling at the Tropic Seamount, one of the Sahara Seanounts, showed. ==References== Category:Geology of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Seamounts of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Seamounts ","title":"Sahara Seamounts"},{"id":"56620787","text":"The 2nd Cruiser Squadron was a formation of cruisers of the British Royal Navy from 1904 to 1919 and from 1921 to 1941 and again from 1946 to 1952. ==History== ===First formation=== The 2nd Cruiser Squadron was first formed in December, 1904 then placed under the command of Prince Louis of Battenberg in February 1905.

Labor was born to Jewish parents and was Jewish himself until his conversion to Roman Catholicism on 23 December 1914. He married Elsa Reiss in 1912 after the pair met at college in Austria and had three children together during the course of World War I. It was during that conflict that he served as a medical officer and was once a Russian captive until his release a short time later. He opened a medical practice in Pula in Croatia where he dedicated himself to the poor as well as to a range of different social issues and collaborated with Catholic Action in the region. He even changed his last name at the behest of his father in order to make him seem more Italianized. He was a lover of literature and published around 200 articles in various newspapers and magazines. The sudden death of his wife in 1934 left him alone since his children were adults. This prompted him to join the priesthood and he was ordained as such in 1940 after the Salesians of Don Bosco rejected his application to join their religious congregation. He served as a noted preacher and spiritual director and served a Fascist exile towards the end of World War II. His Jewish origins and his status as a priest saw Josip Broz Tito and his communists imprison him for several months. Labor died from a heart attack in late 1954 as he himself predicted. His cause for canonization was launched some decades after and culminated on 5 June 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable. ==Life== Marcello Labor was born in mid-1890 in Trieste as the second of two children born to the Hungarian-born banker (and Jewish) Carlo (18.08.1856‚Äì30.07.1931) and the Italian-born Miriam Forti (26.10.1865‚Äì07.10.1897). His brother was Ferruccio (08.05.1888‚Äì28.01.1923) and his sole maternal uncle was Gino Forti (11.06.1864‚Äì08.12.1914). His father was from Kanisza. From his childhood he loved to write and often kept diaries and correspondence with other contemporaries during the course of his studies in Trieste. Those he corresponded with included people such as Guido Devescovi and Scipio Slataper. He also became friends with Guglielmo Reiss-Romoli who later became his brother-in-law. His love for literature would be something that would grow over time and remain until his death decades later. He later attended the college in Vienna where he would meet his future wife Elsa Reiss (17.01.1891‚Äì17.01.1934) whom he married in the Jewish rite in 1912 in Trieste. He graduated in medicine in 1914 and received his degree in Graz. Labor and Elsa were both baptized into Roman Catholicism on 23 December 1914 and fathered three children with his wife. His children were: * Maria (04.01.1915‚Äì09.03.1916) ‚Äì born and died in Trieste * Giuliana Guarnero (13.03.1917‚Äì14.12.2005) ‚Äì born in Croatia * Livio Labor (01.07.1918‚Äì09.04.1999) ‚Äì born in Lviv Labor became a medical officer in the Italian armed forces during World War I and served on the frontlines in Austro-Hungarian territories including Ljubljana. But Russian soldiers captured him at some stage during the conflict though later released him. The conflict's end saw him settle in Pula in Croatia where he set up his medical practice and helped raise his children alongside his wife. His father also suggested he change is Jewish surname to \\"Labor\\" so as to take focus off his Jewish roots since his father predicted that this would bring trouble if he kept his original surname. Labor worked for the poor and dedicated himself to social justice issues while he also published over 200 pieces on different topics in local newspapers and magazines during the course of the 1930s. He also collaborated with the Catholic Action movement and the Saint Vincent de Paul group operating in the area. He also founded the \\"Catholic Center\\" as a place that could teach doctrine and encourage Eucharistic devotion through adoration. Labor studied the tuberculosis disease as a doctor as well as a range of other ailments in his work as a medical researcher in addition to general practitioner. Labor's extensive diaries spanned several and detailed his medical research as well as his interest in the faith and his activities while living in Pula. But the Labor's fortunes halted in 1934 after Elsa died in Pula after a sudden decline in health that saw one of her legs amputated. His adult children had lives of their own at this point which left Labor alone to pursue his call to the priesthood after having asked for special permission to do so due to his married state and conversion. He also had a special respect for the Salesians of Don Bosco and had applied to enter their religious congregation. But he was upset when the congregation denied his request and refused him admittance which prompted him to settle on diocesan priesthood rather than religious priesthood. He commenced his ecclesial studies and later received his solemn ordination to the priesthood in Trieste in the San Giusto cathedral on 21 September 1940 from the Bishop of Trieste Antonio Santin. Labor was then appointed as the rector for Trieste seminarians and then served also as a spiritual director in Gorizia. He later served as a pastor for the San Giusto cathedral (since 1948 after the death of Monsignor Guido Galvani) and became a noted preacher and spiritual director. From 1943 until the war's end in 1945 he was subjected to a Fascist exile due to the dual offences of being both a priest and Jewish in origin. To that end he worked as the vicar for the parish of Fossalta di Portogruaro for the duration of his exile. His misfortune continued after the war after Josip Broz Tito and his anti-Christian communists imprisoned him on 13 August 1947. Labor was tried and sentenced to imprisonment that would have seen him released in late 1948 though he was released just a few months after on 30 December. It was at some point during his priesthood that he was named as a Monsignor. Labor later was made the rector of seminarians at Capodistria. Labor died on 29 September 1954 in Trieste at Via Besenghi due to a heart attack. He himself predicted that he would die of a heart attack. The marker for his tomb in the church of Sant'Antonio Taumaturgo reads: \\"Marcello Labor: former parish priest of San Giusto\\". In his will he asked to be buried in his soutaine with no liturgical vestments or other insignia and dictated himself the simple words that would mark his grave. ==Beatification process== His son Livio. The process for his beatification opened under Pope John Paul II on 25 April 1996 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Labor as a Servant of God and published the \\"nihil obstat\\" edict (no objections to the cause) that launched the diocesan process of investigation. This process was held in Trieste and was closed on 11 June 2000 with the C.C.S. providing validation for the investigation in Rome on 1 February 2001 before receiving the Positio dossier for assessment in 2004. Nine theologians voiced their assent to the cause on 13 February 2014 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. later on 2 June 2015. The process culminated on 5 June 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed that Labor lived a model life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable. The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan friar Giovangiuseppe Califano. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Geni profile * Hagiography Circle Category:1890 births Category:1954 deaths Category:19th-century Italian people Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Italian physicians Category:20th-century Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:20th- century venerated Christians Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism Category:Italian male writers Category:Italian military doctors Category:Italian military personnel of World War I Category:Italian Roman Catholic writers Category:Jewish Italian writers Category:Magazine writers Category:Newspaper writers Category:People from Trieste Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis ","title":"Marcello Labor"},{"id":"56620846","text":"Jung Si-yun (born 8 September 2000) is a South Korean ice hockey player.

He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia in the 1924 Summer Olympics in the stern of the men's eight. ==Club and state rowing== Cummings was employed as a Postal Assistant and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Cummings was coxswain in each of those crews and steered the 1920, 1922 and 1923, South Australian eights to victory. In 1921, 1922 and 1923 he was in those crews with his older brother Frank Cummings. ==International representative rowing== The South Australian media pushed for the victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign.1920 Olympics at Austn Rowing History By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Cummings and the South Australian crew including his brother Frank, were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed \\"the Murray Cods\\". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden 2000 speech remembering the Murray Cods It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew (including Cummings) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm. In the Olympic regatta, with Cummings in the stern the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Bob Cummings continued on as a first-class coxswain after the Olympics. He coxed South Australian representative eights in the King's Cup campaigns of 1925 (fourth) and 1926 (second).1926 Interstate Regatta ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Australian male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Australia Category:Rowers at the 1924 Summer Olympics ","title":"Robert Cummings (rowing)"},{"id":"56620930","text":"\\"Queens\\" is a song performed by Finnish singer-songwriter Saara Aalto.

Lesions connected to the affected gut via a healthy tissue are referred to as metastatic lesions. ==Presentation== Most common clinical manifestation of vulvar CD is unilateral labial swelling associated with chronic vulvar ulceration, along with perianal lesions which were reported in 48% of the patients. Dermatologic inflammatory vulvo-vaginal lesions are usually caused by fistulas arising from the anus or rectum. However, not all inflammatory lesions within the genitalia are caused in fistulas fashion, even in patients suffering from gastrointestinal Crohn‚Äôs disease. Similar clinical lesions have been reported in male genitalia affecting the penis and the scrotum. Vulvar CD bears no typical symptoms and is only diagnosed and associated with gastrointestinal CD based on vulvar ulcers and hypertrophic lesions. Some patients do, however, report vulvar pain, pruritus, dyspareunia or dysuria. Upon examination, at least one of 4 types of vulvar lesions can be present. Vulvar swelling, edema; inflammatory and asymmetrical swelling affecting both labia minora and majora or the vaginal wall. Swelling affects approximately 67% of patients with vulvar CD. Ulceration; may vary in numbers, size and depth from patient to patient. However, linear ulcers extending to the groin are typical for genital CD. Vulvar ulcers were present in approximately 40% of the patients. Hypertrophic lesions; may either affect the whole labia or be localized. Hypertrophic lesions are not inflammatory and there are no functional symptoms and the main issue seems to be their unpleasant appearance. Their exhibition has been reported in approximately 24% of vulvar CD patients. Chronic suppuration; vulvar abscesses have been reported in approximately 17% of the patients. ==Course of the disease== The progress of vulvar CD is unpredictable; spontaneous healing has been reported, as well as cases requiring surgery or vulvectomy. ==Diagnosis== The most reliable diagnostic tool for vulvar CD is histological analysis of biopsies. Positive diagnosis is further supported by the presence of chronic inflammatory infiltrates, epidermal ulceration, along with noncaseating tuberculoid granulomas. Proper testing should also include vaginal smear for detection of several viral species, blood cell count and serology for HIV, C-reactive protein and TPHA-VDRL. Visual investigation can also be useful in case of abscesses or fistulated lesions. Vulvar CD bears great clinical similarity to Behcet‚Äôs disease. ==Management== The treatment of vulvar CD mostly consists of medical therapy with only a few cases having to resort to surgery. This therapy is based on corticosteroids, the immunosuppressive effect of which is commonly used for the treatment of regular gastrointestinal CD. Corticosteroids may be administered on their own, or combined with either metronidazole or azathioprine, or both, for increased efficiency. However, direct injection or local administration of corticosteroids has been mostly unsatisfactory. The anti-TNFŒ± treatment has also been successful in 5 out of 6 reported cases, with infliximab being applied either alone or combined with azathioprine or methotrexate. Administration of infliximab has provided only after previous treatment with antibiotics or immunosuppressive. Surgical approach has been conducted in a minority of cases and mostly consists of either vulvectomy, laser vaporization, lesion excision, or vulvar abscess draining. Surgical management has unfortunately been comparably more unsuccessful than medical, and should only see minimal use, with the exception of cases nonresponding to medical treatment, drainage of vulvar abscesses and resection of surface lesions. ==References== Category:Vulva Category:Inflammatory diseases of female pelvic organs ","title":"Vulvar Crohn's disease"},{"id":"56621009","text":"Ali Soozandeh (born 22 March 1970), is an Iranian-born German animator and filmmaker. He is best known for the 2017 German-Austrian animated film Tehran Taboo, which explores sexual and gender double standards in Iran. == Early life and education == Soozandeh was born in Shiraz, Iran. He studied art in Tehran before emigrating to Germany in 1995. After emigrating to Germany, he received a diploma in Media Design from the Technical University of Cologne. He is the only member of his family who lives outside Iran. == Career == In Germany, Soozandeh worked as an animation specialist in film and television, directing music videos and other short films. and founded his own company, Intaktfilm. He also His work in animation included the documentary The Green Wave (2010), which won the Grimme Preis Award for Best Documentary. He also produced the animated sequences of Camp 14: Total Control Zone, a 2012 German/South Korean documentary by Marc Wiese about the Kaechon internment camp, known as \\"Camp 14,\\" in North Korea. ===Tehran Taboo=== His first feature film was Tehran Taboo, an animated film which explores \\"the secret life of young people in Iran struggling to express their sexuality and embrace life while living under the country's oppressive, theocratic regime\\". The film had its premiere at the International Critics' Week sidebar of the 70th Cannes Film Festival in May 2017. and opened to generally favorable reviews in the U.S. in February 2018. The film has attracted attention for its subject matter and its visual style, which The Hollywood Reporter has described as \\"a unique combination of rotoscoping and motion capture with hand-drawn and computer animation\\". Soozandeh told HuffPost that the inspiration for the film came from a conversation he overheard between two young Iranians on a train, concerning their experiences with women in Iran. One of them talked about a prostitute who took her child along when meeting clients. The anecdote about the prostitute and child was the \\"lightning bolt\\" that made him want to tell this story, and it became one of the plot elements in Tehran Taboo. The title was derived from sex being a taboo subject in Iran which people are not allowed to talk about openly. The film, he says, is about \\"breaking silence, breaking taboos\\". He has said that his aim in making the film was to promote social change in his native country. Since the film could not possibly be made in Tehran, Soozandeh used the rotoscoping technique, which combines animation with live action, thereby allowing Iranian visual elements to be superimposed on each scene. ==ReferencesInterview at Cannes with Ali Soozandeh Category:Iranian film directors Category:Iranian expatriates in Germany Category:1970 births Category:Living people ","title":"Ali Soozandeh"},{"id":"56621029","text":"AG11 may refer to: *Russian submarine AG-11 *SR58 (battery) ","title":"AG11"},{"id":"56621031","text":"Michaela Sejpalov√° (born 6 February 1998) is a Czech short track speed skater.

There was a coalition of terrorists coming from all over against the Tuaregs. It must be said that the MNLA Chief of Staff, Machkanani Ag Balla, went straight with his group to join the terrorist camp. And the other MNLA brigades also followed. The fighting was very violent. A huge fire blanket was coming from both sides. The MNLA, at the beginning of the day of 17 November, had taken account of its losses.

It is situated in Cascais Municipality, Lisbon District. It was one of the first systems of sea-level data collection installed on the coast of Europe and is still in use. The Cascais tide gauge ==History== Located at the entrance to the Bay of Cascais, below the Citadel of Cascais and to the northeast side of Cascais Marina, and covered by a hemispherical dome, this tide gauge was built in 1877 in Paris by the clockmakers Am√©d√©e-Philippe Borrel and Jean Wagner. The gauge was considered necessary because of the difficulties with access to the port of Lisbon as a result of a sand bar in the river Tagus. When it began operations there were only three other sites with similar equipment in the world, at Brest, Aberdeen and Hook of Holland. It was originally installed in 1882 at another location, close to the marine biology laboratory established in the Citadel by King Carlos I who was a keen oceanographer and carried out twelve expeditions for this purpose. The gauge made it possible to measure the average water level along the Portuguese coast and was used for the completion of the geodesic survey of mainland Portugal, which was conducted between 1857 and 1892. The altimeter \\"reference-zero\\" (mean sea level), used by all Portuguese cartography, was based on its readings. The gauge employs an analog measuring system, working with a float that is placed in a well into which enters water connected directly to the sea. The movement of the float is transmitted by a system of ropes and pulleys connected to a measuring system, more precisely to a pen that registers on a sheet of paper on a rotating circular drum, similar to the system employed by a Barograph. ==Use of data== Interior view of Tide Gauge showing data recording equipment At the end of the 19th Century the gauge was moved by around 30 metres to its current position, since the data collected at the original location were not very reliable due to the distance from the open sea. The gauge has been in continuous operation since 1895. It is one of the oldest still active, and has provided a lengthy time series that, for example, confirms that the average sea level has risen by about 15cm or by 1.3 mm per year since it was installed. Its readings are used by the scientific community, nationally and internationally, and are sent to and are available from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level. PSMSL page with data from Cascais ==Recent developments== Adaptations were made in 1996 to incorporate more modern measuring systems but the original equipment is still used for calibration purposes. All measurements made since the inception of the gauge are in the process of being digitized. It was originally planned to incorporate a new acoustic digital system in the existing structure. However, there were two problems with this; the fact that the addition of a digital system would affect the inflow and outflow of water into the analog well, and the impact of the new marina on the accuracy of the gauges, as a result of a delay in the arrival of the waves. It was therefore decided to proceed with the installation of the digital acoustic system elsewhere and infrastructure for this is now located in the Administration building of the new marina about 250 meters from the analog tide gauge. Tests for this began in July, 2003 and the system came into full operation in October, 2003. Data from this is transmitted by GSM. However, the original gauge is still in use, operated by the Portuguese Geographic Institute. As a result of collaboration between the Municipality of Cascais and the Institute, the gauge can be visited by appointment. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Buildings and structures in Cascais Category:Tide gauges ","title":"Cascais tide gauge"},{"id":"56621075","text":"Shione Kaminaga (born 26 September 1999) is a Japanese short track speed skater.

It is closely associated with the Scottish fiddler and composer Niel Gow who lived in nearby Inver. Gow is said to have composed many of his most famous tunes whilst sitting beneath the oak. The connection is commemorated by a plaque and engraved bench. The tree has been entered into the Scottish and European Tree of the Year competitions. Niel Gow's Oak was badly damaged by storms in 2011 and 2012. == Description == Niel Gow's Oak is a sessile oak (Quercus petraea) located near to the towns of Dunkeld and Birnam, Perthshire, Scotland that is around 300 years old. It lies within the Craigvinean Forest on the south bank of the River Tay. It accessible by the public and lies on the Inver Walk public footpath, part of the Dunkeld Path Network. It lies between the path and the riverbank in a field used to graze sheep and horses. == Niel Gow connection == Niel Gow (1727‚Äì1807) was a Scottish fiddler who lived in nearby Inver and composed many Scottish country dance tunes. The oak has been linked to Gow since at least 1855 when it featured in an Illustrated London News article. The connection was also made in an 1881 journal article. Gow is said to have sat beneath the tree to compose many of his most famous tunes. The music could be heard from the far bank of the Tay by John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl who was said to have been so impressed that he paid Gow a retainer to play at family functions. In recognition of the connection the Forestry Commission, which owns the tree and the land it stands on, erected a bench under the tree. It was engraved with the words \\"sit beneath the fiddle tree, with the ghost of Niel Gow next to me\\" ‚Äì lyrics taken from the song \\"Niel Gow's Apprentice\\" by Scottish singer- songwriter Michael Marra. == Recent events == The 2013 memorial bench The tree was entered into the European Tree of the Year awards in 2014, becoming the first Scottish entry into the competition.

He is best known as the author of A Mervalious Combat of Contrarieties (1588) that William Shakespeare used as the source for the parable of the revolt of the members against the belly in Coriolanus. ==Birth, life, and death== Averell's baptism on 12 February 1556 is recorded in the records of the parish of St Peter upon Cornhill. His father, a joiner, was John Averell (d. 1569), and his mother Margareth (d. 1578). Nothing is known about his early life and education, but William E. Burns, writing about Averell in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, notes that he was a member of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors and the Worshipful Company of Vintners. Burns also notes that Averell's prose is Euphuistic and draws on classical knowledge, despite there being no record of his having graduated from Oxford or Cambridge. On 2 November 1578 he married Gyllian Averell, n√©e Goodale (1556‚Äì1596), the daughter of a baker, Robert Goodale and his wife, Ann. Their first child, Annes, was born three months after the wedding. Burns points out the irony of Averell conceiving a child before marriage given the moralism of some of his pamphlets. Gyllian Averell died in 1596, shortly after the birth of their 17th child. Averell remarried and had a further daughter, Elizabeth, born 28 November 1597. Averell died in 1605 and was buried in St Peter upon Cornhill on 23 September. ==Works== Averell supported himself by working as a parish clerk and schoolmaster in St Peter upon Cornhill, where he adorned the parish registers with drawings and poems. He was also a pamphleteer and prose writer, and \\"published several works showing literary versatility and a keen desire to acquire the patronage of the London civic √©lite.\\" His first known publication, An excellent historie, both pithy and pleasant, on the life and death of Charles and Julia, two Brittish, or rather Welsh lovers (1581), was a verse story of star-crossed lovers set in the period of British mythology at the time of Brutus of Troy, and was dedicated to Henry Campyon, a mercer and brewer. Burns describes it as \\"not a distinguished piece of literature\\", but it was one of the few romantic poems of the period that used a British rather than Italian setting. The next was A wonderfull and straunge newes, which happened in the county of Suffolke, and Essex, the first of February, being Friday, where it rayned wheat, the space of vi or vii miles compass (1583). This was a prodigy pamphlet that took a zealously Protestant stand, arguing that the referenced wonder was a sign of the end of the world. It was followed by A Dyall for Dainty Darlings (1584), dedicated to William Wrathe, warden of the Mercers' Company. This was expanded and reissued as Four Notable Histories (1590), now dedicated to Hugh Ofley. The publication for which Averell is best known is A Mervalious Combat of Contrarieties (1588). It begins as a dialogue between the parts of the body in which the tongue urges the body to revolt against the belly and back because of their greed and pride, but is ultimately unmasked as a traitor. Averell eventually abandons the dialogue format and concludes with an exhortation to loyalty to the queen. It was published during the Armada crisis, dedicated to Sir George Bond, the Lord Mayor of London, and includes fierce attacks on Roman Catholics and Jesuits. It was also the principal source for William Shakespeare's use of the parable of the revolt of the members against the belly in Coriolanus. ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== ==Sources== * ==Further reading== * Category:1556 births Category:1605 deaths Category:English pamphleteers Category:People of the Elizabethan era ","title":"William Averell"},{"id":"56621258","text":"Jamil Hamoudi (1924‚Äì2003) was an Iraqi artist who became the Director of the Ministry of Culture's Fine Arts Department. He is noted for his involvement in various Iraqi and Arabic art movements including the Hurufiyya movement which bridged the gap between traditional and modern Iraqi art. ==Life and career== Hamoudi started out as a self-taught sculptor in Baghdad. He developed a naturalistic style. In 1944, he was taken on to teach drawing and art history at a school in Baghdad. At the same time he attended classes at the Baghdad College of Fine Arts. He graduated in 1945 and in 1947, took a government scholarship to go to Paris, to study at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, Acad√©mie Julian, and √âcole du Louvre. He also Hamoudi researched the Assyrian-Babylonian art and languages.Naef, S., A la Recherche d'une Modernit√© Arabe: L'√©volution des arts Plastiques en Egypte, au Liban et en Irak, Slatkine, 1996, p. 394 In 1943, he created what has been described as the first Iraqi sculpture; a figure of the 11th-century philosopher-poet, Al- Ma øarri.Beaug√©, F. and Cl√©ment, J-F., L'image dans le Monde Arabe,CNRS √âditions, 1995, p. 41 By 1947, he was experimenting with abstract paintings using Arabic characters, and as such was one of the early pioneers of hurufiyya art.Inati, S.C., Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics, Humanity Books, 2003, p.76 This led him on a path to discover the graphic possibilities of the letter in art.Beaug√©, F. and Cl√©ment, J-F., L'image dans le Monde Arabe,CNRS √âditions, 1995, p. 147 Certain art historians regard him as the \\"founding father\\" of the hurufiyya movement (alphabetical art movement or Letrism movement). Bocco, R., Bozarslan, H. and Sluglett, P., Writing The Modern History Of Iraq: Historiographical And Political Challenges, World Scientific, 2012, p. 478 However, other scholars have suggested that the movement began somewhat earlier with the work of the Iraqi-American artist, Madiha Omar who exhibited huryifiyya artwork in 1949 in Washington.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 pp 115-119 Whether he was the movement's founder, or simply helped to popularise the hurufiyya genre, there can be little doubt that he was a leading light in Iraq's modern art movement.Inati, S.C., Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics, Humanity Books, 2003, p.76 He defined his use of Arabic script in the context of rediscovering his own heritage, amid his studies of European art. He wanted to cling onto his own values and traditions as a means of avoiding being overtaken by experiences outside his own heritage. He wrote that there was nothing more sacred that the Arabic alphabet, Amirsadeghi, H., Mikdadi, S. and Shabout, N.M., New Vision: Arab Contemporary Art in the 21st Century, Thames & Hudson, 2009, p. 32 saying that his art was \\"a form of prayer.\\"Beaug√©, F. and Cl√©ment, J-F., L'image dans le Monde Arabe,CNRS √âditions, 1995, p. 41 Hamoudi actively contributed to Iraqi arts culture through his membership of various art groups and societies in Iraq, and by organising exhibitions for up-coming artists, at a time when Iraq had no public galleries. In 1952, he organised an exhibition, entitled L'Ensemble \\"A\\" at the Institut Endoplastique in Paris.Miller, D., Lemoine, S. and Mosquera, G., Carmen Herrera: Lines of Sight, Yale University Press, 2016, p. 201 In 1971, he became a founding member of the One Dimension Group, started by his friend and colleague, artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said. Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117 In 1971 he joined the One Dimension Group when it was founded by Shakir Hassan Al Said and which sought to use art as a means of developing a sense of national identify. Jamil defined his use of Arabic script as a rediscovery of Iraqi heritage, withih the confines of European abstract art. Amirsadeghi, H., Mikdadi, S., Shabout, N.N., New Vision: Arab Contemporary Art in the 21st Century, Thames & Hudson, 2009, p. 32 Hamoudi and the art groups in which he was involved were largely responsible for bridging the gap between modernity and heritage, and establishing Iraqi modern art. Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan, Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30 In 1973 he was appointed as Director of Fine Arts at the Ministry of Culture. ==Work== Hamoudi's early works reveal the influence of Cubism movement and later he identified himself with the surrealist movement. In time, however, he distanced himself from Surrealists, claiming: Ultimately, he developed his own style; one that referenced his Iraqi heritage, but also used modern techniques. His paintings are brightly colored and make use of geometric shapes like circles, triangles and arches, often in repeating patterns, a reference to Arabesque.Massignon, L., Opera minora: Islam, Culture et Soci√©t√© Islamiques, Dar-el-Maaref Liban, 1963,p. 231 For sculpture he frequently used plaster, stone, wood, metal, copper, glass, marble, Plexiglas and ceramics.d ===Publications=== * Peintures, Sculptures, Dessins de Jamil HAMOUDI un artiste de Bagdad, Paris, Librairie Voyelle, 1950 ===Select list of paintings and drawings=== * Sheytan, (The Devil), 1942, gouache on paper, 50 X 35cm * Composition Absraite, 1950, India ink and watercolor, 32 X 24cm) * Huryfieh , 1982, ink on paper, 70 X 100cm * Surat Abasa, 1982, pen on paper, 69 X 69cm * Ezkor Rabbak Eza Nasayt, (If Ever Forgetful Mention Allah), 1985 oil on canvas, 87 X 129cm (now in the collection of the Barjeel Foundation)Barjeel Foundation, Online: * A Trip to Baghdad, 1996, oil on canvas, 69.5 X 69.5cm ==See also== * Islamic art * Islamic calligraphy * List of Iraqi artists ==External link== * Jamil Hamoudia at Art Iraq - digital resource maintained by Iraqi artists which includes reproductions of works lost or damaged during the 2003 invasion, and not accessible via any other reliable public source ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2003 deaths Category:20th-century artists Category:20th-century calligraphers Category:20th-century painters Category:20th-century sculptors Category:Abstract artists Category:Abstract sculptors Category:Artist authors Category:Artists from Baghdad Category:Iraqi artists Category:Iraqi calligraphers Category:Iraqi painters Category:Iraqi sculptors Category:Iraqi expatriates in France ","title":"Jamil Hamoudi"},{"id":"56621298","text":"The Brice Apartments, located at 228 2nd Ave. E. in Kalispell, Montana, were built in 1936.

The initial three co-founders were Kasky, Alex Wind, and Sofie Whitney. On February 15, 2018, one day after the shooting, Kasky met with Wind at a candlelight vigil. Wind stated, \\"The day after the shooting, we said something needs to happen; there needs to be a central space; there needs to be a movement.\\" After the vigil, Kasky invited Wind and Whitney to his house. Kasky came up with the name \\"Never Again\\" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted \\"Stay alert. #NeverAgain\\" to Facebook. Over the next three days after the shooting, the group gained over 35,000 followers on Facebook. Kasky recruited other Stoneman Douglas students David Hogg, Emma Gonz√°lez, and Delaney Tarr at a gun-control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where they spoke; other students quickly joined. The students gave as many interviews as they could to television networks. The group said they worked quickly to take advantage of the national media attention given to the shooting and its aftermath. Numerous Stoneman Douglas students have been shown in media coverage. By the next day, the group had created Twitter accounts and announced a nationwide protest, for March 24, 2018. The March 24 protest involved millions of people in over 800 sites across the US and in other countries. ==Activism== Never Again MSD has inspired students from across the country to protest the nation's gun laws. Photo: a student \\"lie-in\\" at the White House on February 19, 2018. The Fort Lauderdale gun control rally at Broward County Federal Courthouse on February 17, 2018 was attended by hundreds of supporters. Elected officials and gun control advocates, including Florida Senator Gary Farmer, called for common sense gun laws and firearm safety legislation. At this rally, Emma Gonz√°lez began her speech with a moment of silence for the 17 victims killed in the school shooting. She then gave an impassioned 11-minute speech, in which she demanded to know where the \\"common sense\\" was in America's gun laws, calling out members of Congress who have accepted contributions from the NRA. Gonz√°lez was noted for rebuking \\"thoughts and prayers\\" from the government and President Donald Trump. Never Again MSD has inspired vigils to protest gun violence and discuss reforms. Image: students of Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California. In an opinion column for CNN, Parkland student Cameron Kasky wrote: \\"We can't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I'm asking‚Äîno, demanding‚Äîwe take action now.\\" David Hogg said, in an interview with CBS This Morning, \\"The policy makers in this country must work together. And I don't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat. These are children's lives.\\" Delaney Tarr wrote an op-ed for Teen Vogue, in which she discussed why she and her fellow students were organizing in response to the mass shooting at Parkland. She stated \\"Knowing that we can keep this from happening to even one more person is the only thing that makes me feel even a little bit better about living through this senseless tragedy ... We are no longer just high school students, that much is true. We are now the future, we are a movement, we are the change.\\" The first organized #NeverAgain movement protest was a march on the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee on February 20, 2018. The group worked with congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Florida Senator Lauren Book to arrange a bus trip for one hundred students and fifteen parent chaperones to the Capitol to voice their concerns with lawmakers and demand action on gun violence. Jaclyn Corin was a key organizer of the bus trip protest. A report in Vanity Fair suggested it was her idea to have the bus trip soon after the shooting because it was alive in the news cycle; she said \\"the news forgets ‚Äì very quickly ‚Äì we needed a critical mass event.\\" Sofie Whitney, one of the organizers of the bus trip, was interviewed by CNN's Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper while on the bus en route. Several students, along with Fred Guttenberg, father of a slain student, watched from the gallery as the Florida House voted against considering a bill to ban assault weapons (such as AR-15 style rifles) and high-capacity magazines in a vote of 71 to 36. More than 3,000 people attended a rally at the Capitol the following day. Never Again MSD and other groups have also played a part in corporations' revocation of NRA sponsorships and discounts for NRA members. Firms which have severed ties with the NRA include the First National Bank of Omaha; car rental companies Hertz, Avis, Enterprise, and Budget; insurer MetLife; Symantec software; home security firm SimpliSafe; and airlines including Delta and United. Never Again MSD has been credited for including persons of color within their movement. Jaclyn Corin recognized that \\"Parkland received more attention because of its affluence,\\" while David Hogg faulted the media for \\"not giving black students a voice.\\" Alex Wind said the protests were about ending gun violence against all communities. In May 2018 when a decision by the NRA was made to ban guns at a conference in Dallas, at the urging of the Secret Service to protect vice president Mike Pence, Parkland students criticized the decision as hypocritical. ===March for Our Lives=== March for Our Lives, a nationwide demonstration that included a march held in Washington, D.C., took place on March 24, 2018. The event was conducted in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. Hundreds of thousands of protesters showed up at demonstrations across the United States, as well as internationally, to demand action against gun violence. Many Marjory Stoneman Douglas students spoke out in Washington, DC. Gonz√°lez briefly spoke, naming the victims, before standing silent on stage for four minutes. She was on stage for six minutes and twenty seconds, the length of the Parkland shooting. Yolanda Renee King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s 9-year-old granddaughter brought in by Corin, said during her speech, \\"I have a dream that enough is enough.\\" In addition to sharing the stage at the protest with King, they also passed the mic to Virginia African-American elementary school student Naomi Wadler. Sir Paul McCartney, speaking to CNN at a sister march in New York City, revealed his T-shirt reading \\"We can end gun violence.\\" ===Town halls=== Never Again MSD has worked to organize town hall meetings across the United States to hold Congress members accountable for their position on gun laws. For town halls on April 7, 2018, the group confirmed events in 30 districts. At a town hall near Parkland, supporters passed out red bumper stickers calling for an assault weapons ban. ===Cross‚Äìcountry gun control tour=== In June 2018, Never Again MSD announced that the group would travel throughout the United States and hold rallies that summer to call for stronger gun control, and to encourage teenagers who would be eighteen by November 2018 to vote in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. The group stated that it intended to appear in cities where the NRA held the most influence. During the summer and fall, the students traveled to every district in Florida and 30 states across the country, visiting over 100 communities, registering 50,000 voters, and raising awareness about gun violence. In the weeks before the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, the group engaged in another national tour specifically focused on election-related efforts like educating, registering, and encouraging youth voters to vote in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. ==Response== George and Amal Clooney donated $500,000 to the organization to help with the cost of organizing the March for Our Lives demonstration, which they also participated in. Following the Clooneys' announcement, other celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg pledged to match the $500,000 donation. In a CNN editorial entitled \\"The NRA's worst nightmare is here,\\" Dean Obeidallah compared Never Again MSD to the \\"early days of the #MeToo movement, which caused a cultural shift regarding sexual misconduct.\\" After some schools threatened to suspend students for participating in peaceful Never Again MSD (#NeverAgain) protests, hundreds of U.S. colleges pledged they would not penalize students disciplined for taking part. These colleges, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University, and the University of Florida, added their names to #NeverAgain Colleges. Michelle and Barack Obama penned a letter of support to the Parkland students, ending their letter with \\"we will be there for you.\\" In March 2018, Michelle and Barack Obama penned a handwritten letter to the students of Parkland, expressing admiration for their advocacy against gun violence: === Misinformation and criticism === Attempts to discredit the Never Again MSD movement in the media have taken the form of verbal attacks and misinformation by right-wing Republican leaders. Former Republican senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum attacked the Parkland activists verbally during an interview with CNN, suggesting that students should take classes in CPR rather than marching in Washington. The Washington Post quoted several doctors ridiculing Santorum for suggesting CPR, which is useless for trauma and blood loss. Leslie Gibson, a Republican candidate for the Maine House of Representatives, disparaged Emma Gonz√°lez and David Hogg, but later apologized for his comments and withdrew his candidacy. Iowa Republican Representative Steve King's campaign criticized Emma Gonz√°lez for displaying her Cuban heritage. NRA board member rock musician Ted Nugent described the Parkland activists as \\"mushy brained and soulless liars,\\". Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist and host of InfoWars, led a campaign to discredit Emma Gonz√°lez, David Hogg, and other March for Our Lives protesters by comparing them to Nazis. Fake pictures and GIFs of Emma Gonz√°lez tearing up a copy of the U.S. Constitution circulated on social media in March 2018. The images were doctored from originals of Gonz√°lez tearing up a shooting target sign. Actor and conservative commentator Adam Baldwin defended circulating the doctored images as \\"political satire\\". ===New laws=== In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raised the minimum age for buying firearms to 21, established waiting periods and background checks, provided a program for the arming of some teachers and the hiring of school police, banned bump stocks, and barred potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, it allocated around $400 million. The governor signed the bill into law on March 9. He commented, \\"To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn't let up and you fought until there was change.\\" John Cassidy stated in The New Yorker, \\"This was the first time in thirty years that Florida had passed any gun restrictions, and it was a direct response to the Never Again movement, which was founded by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\\" Salon suggested that Republican lawmakers have generally remained silent about gun control measures because \\"they depend heavily on NRA campaign donations, and even more on the NRA's cadre of pro-gun voters\\".Chauncey Devega, April 4, 2018, Salon magazine, The right‚Äôs Parkland problem: A symptom of authoritarian parenting: Conservatives see the Parkland students as disrespectful and dangerous ‚Äî and those feelings stem from primal fears.

She is known from a relief found at the temple in Semna in Nubia. Karimala had the title of Great Royal Wife and princess. In the scene at Semna, the queen is shown with double feather crown, scourge and long robe. Isis is standing in front of the queen, and here is a longer inscription, written in Egyptian hieroglyphics, which are difficult to read.

Robert Morkot, The A to Z of Ancient Egyptian Warfare, Rowman & Littlefield, 2010 Although the precise dating of the inscription and hence Karimala is not certain, it can be assumed that it dates back to the Twenty- First or Twenty-Second Dynasty. This period (about 1000‚Äì750 BC) is considered the dark age of Nubian history, from which almost nothing is known. This inscription proves the continuation of certain power structures.John Coleman Darnell: The Inscription of Queen Katimala at Semna: Textual evidence for the origins of the Napatan State.

Bennett prefers a marriage to Siamun, because in that case she could have taken over the position of the Viceroy of Kush, Neskhons, as a religious figurehead in Nubia after the death of the latter in year 5 of king Siamun. ==References== ==Further reading== *L√°szl√≥ T√∂r√∂k, Between Two Worlds: The Frontier Region between Ancient Nubia and Egypt 3700 BC ‚Äì AD 500.

The age of Cuttie's Hillock Sandstone (Perm-Triassic) of the Elgin Area. Scottish Journal of Geology 9:177-183. It preserves fossils and fossil footprints from various extinct animals such as pareiasaurs and dicynodonts, which are collectively often referred to as the Elgin Reptiles. The formation, named for the village of Hopeman, lies unconformably over the Devonian Upper Old Red Sandstone, and it underlies the waterlain sandstones of the Burghead Sandstone Formation. It represents a windswept dune landscape. The Hopeman Sandstones were previously referred to as the Cutties Hillock Sandstone, Quarry Wood Sandstones, Sandstones of Hopeman, and Hopeman-Cummingstown Sandstone, but these names have since been superseded. ==Lithology== The Hopeman Sandstone Formation is predominantly composed of fine- to coarse-grained yellowish sand with well rounded grains, mostly deposited as wind-blown dunes, but occasionally deposited by sheet floods. Basal beds are pebbly and the unit varies, exhibiting large-scale crossbedding to fine rarely contorted laminations. Some beds are friable, while others hard and siliceous. ==Origin of names== The name Cutties Hillock is believed to derive from the Scottish Gaelic , meaning 'hill brow of the hunting'.Benton MJ and Walker AD. 1985.

Palaeontology 28:207-234 The name first appeared in print after the discovery of the Elgin Reptiles in 1884. Although now formally considered part of the Hopeman Sandstone Formation, the Cuttie's Hillock Sandstone is still used to refer to the inland outcroppings of Hopeman Sandstone, particularly at Quarry Wood near Elgin. Benton and Walker (1985) argue that the name Cuttie's Hillock Sandstone should be retained to distinguish these fossil-bearing beds from those on the coast, which have only yielded footprints and very few body fossils. == Paleobiota == The pareiasaur Elginia and dicynodonts Geikia and Gordonia are known from the formation, the fossils are preserved as hollow internal moulds within the sandstone. ==See also== * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Scotland ==References== ==External links== * Category:Permian Scotland Category:Sandstone formations Category:Permian System of Europe Category:Changhsingian ","title":"Hopeman Sandstone Formation"},{"id":"56621522","text":"Sir Walter Minto Townsend-Farquhar, 2nd Baronet (26 October 1809 ‚Äì 18 June 1866), also spelt Townshend-Farquhar, was a British Conservative Party politician.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.Road at Curraghabweehan townland, Corlough parish, County Cavan, Ireland. Heading eastwards ==Geography== Curraghabweehan is bounded on the west by Corraclassy townland, on the south by Garvary (Corlough) townland, on the north by Drumbeagh townland and on the east by Derryvahan townland. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan) and dug wells. Curraghabweehan is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 55 statute acres. ==History== In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of Drombeagh and Corroboan to William O'Shereden, gentleman, Cheefe of his Name. William Sheridan was the chief of the Sheridan Clan in County Cavan. He was the son of the previous chief, Hugh Duff O'Sheridan of Togher townland, Kilmore parish, County Cavan. William was the ancestor of the famous Sheridan theatrical family. William died sometime before 1638 leaving two sons, Owen (of Mullaghmore, Tullyhunco) and Patrick (of Raleagh townland, Kildallan parish). Owen Sheridan succeeded to his father's lands. Owen's son Denis was born in 1612 and became a Catholic priest in charge of Kildrumferton parish, County Cavan. He later converted to Protestantism and on 10 June 1634 William Bedell, the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, ordained him as a Minister of the Church of Ireland and two days later Denis was collated to the Vicarage of Killasser in the Diocese of Kilmore. Denis had several children, including William Sheridan (Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh) 1682-1691 (his son Donald kept up the Templeport connection by marrying Mrs Enery of Bawnboy); Patrick Sheridan, Cloyne, Protestant Bishop of Cloyne (1679-1682) and Sir Thomas Sheridan (politician) Chief Secretary of State for Ireland (1687-1688). The Sheridan lands in Curraghabweehan were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows: The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as Curraghabeghan and the proprietor as Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford. A further confirming grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforementioned Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet included, inter alia, 76 acres and 3 roods in Curraghboghan and Drumbeagh. By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the lands of Curraghbegan and Drumbeagh were included in the creation of a new Manor of Beresford. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as Curraghbuhan. An 1813 map depicts the townland as Curraghboghan and Curraghoghan. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list seven tithepayers in the townland. and The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks describe the townland as- The soil is of a clayey nature...The townland is bounded on the north side by a large stream. The Curraghabweehan Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839. In 1841 the population of the townland was 32, being 15 males and 17 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 26, being 12 males and 14 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists five landholders in the townland. In 1861 the population of the townland was 25, being 11 males and 14 females. There were five houses in the townland and all were inhabited. In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are three families listed in the townland, and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are three families listed in the townland. ==Antiquities== # Stepping Stones across the river ==References== ==External links== *The IreAtlas Townland Data Base Category:Townlands of County Cavan ","title":"Curraghabweehan"},{"id":"56621652","text":"Sequiwaimanu is an extinct genus of early penguin.

He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight. ==Club and state rowing== Graetz was employed as a fireman on the South Australian Railways and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Graetz was the bowman in each of those crews (though he rowed at seven in 1921) and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923,. ==International representative rowing== The South Australian media pushed for Graetz's victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Graetz and the South Australian crew were selected in- toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed \\"the Murray Cods\\". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924. In the Olympic regatta, with Graetz in the bow, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Harry Graetz continued on as a first-class oarsman after the Olympics. He was again in the bow of the South Australian representative eight in its King's Cup campaign of 1925 (fourth place).1925 Interstate Regatta ==References== Category:1893 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Australian male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Australia Category:Rowers at the 1924 Summer Olympics ","title":"Herbert Graetz"},{"id":"56621679","text":"The 2006 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem was a women's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts in Rabat, Morocco that was part of the Tier IV category of the 2006 WTA Tour.

H. Estimating optimal transformations for multiple regression and correlation. J. Am. Stat. Assoc., 80(391):580‚Äì598, September 1985b. ==Introduction== In statistics, nonlinear transformation of variables is commonly used in practice in regression problems. Alternating conditional expectations (ACE) is one of the methods to find those transformations that produce the best fitting additive model. Knowledge of such transformations aids in the interpretation and understanding of the relationship between the response and predictors. ACE transform the response variable Y and its predictor variables, X_i to minimize the fraction of variance not explained. The transformation is nonlinear and is obtained from data in an iterative way. == Mathematical description == Let Y,X_1,\\\\dots,X_p be random variables. We use X_1,\\\\dots,X_p to predict Y. Suppose \\\\theta(Y),\\\\varphi_1(X_1),\\\\dots,\\\\varphi_p(X_p) are zero-mean functions and with these transformation functions, the fraction of variance of \\\\theta(Y) not explained is : e^2(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi_1,\\\\dots,\\\\varphi_p)=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\theta(Y)-\\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i(X_i)\\\\right]^2}{\\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\theta^2(Y)]} Generally, the optimal transformations that minimize the unexplained part are difficult to compute directly. As an alternative, ACE is an iterative method to calculate the optimal transformations. The procedure of ACE has the following steps: # Hold \\\\phi_1(X_1),\\\\dots,\\\\phi_p(X_p) fixed, minimizing e^2gives \\\\theta_1(Y)=\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i(X_i)\\\\BiggY\\\\right] # Normalize \\\\theta_1(Y) to unit variance. # For each k, fix other \\\\varphi_i(X_i) and \\\\theta(Y), minimizing e^2 and the solution is:: \\\\tilde{\\\\varphi}_k = \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\theta(Y)-\\\\sum_{i eq k} \\\\varphi_i(X_i) \\\\Bigg X_k\\\\right] # Iterate the above three steps until e^2 is within error tolerance. ==Bivariate case== The optimal transformation \\\\theta^*(Y), \\\\varphi^*(X) for p=1 satisfies : \\\\rho^*(X, Y) = \\\\rho^*(\\\\theta^*, \\\\varphi^*) = \\\\max_{\\\\theta, \\\\varphi} \\\\rho(\\\\theta(Y), \\\\varphi(X)) where \\\\rho is Pearson correlation coefficient. \\\\rho^*(X, Y) is known as the maximal correlation between X and Y. It can be used as a general measure of dependence. In the bivariate case, ACE algorithm can also be regarded as a method for estimating the maximal correlation between two variables. == Software implementation == The ACE algorithm was developed in the context of known distributions. In practice, data distributions are seldom known and the conditional expectation should be estimated from data. R language has a package \`acepack\` which implements ACE algorithm. The following example shows its usage: library(acepack) TWOPI <\\\\- 8 * atan(1) x <\\\\- runif(200, 0, TWOPI) y <\\\\- exp(sin(x) + rnorm(200)/2) a <\\\\- ace(x, y) par(mfrow=c(3,1)) plot(a$y, a$ty) # view the response transformation plot(a$x, a$tx) # view the carrier transformation plot(a$tx, a$ty) # examine the linearity of the fitted model == Discussion == The ACE algorithm provides a fully automated method for estimating optimal transformations in multiple regression. It also provides a method for estimating maximal correlation between random variables. Since the process of iteration usually terminates in a limited number of runs, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(np) where n is the number of samples. The algorithm is reasonably computer efficient. A strong advantage of the ACE procedure is the ability to incorporate variables of quite different type in terms of the set of values they can assume. The transformation functions \\\\theta(y), \\\\varphi_i(x_i) assume values on the real line. Their arguments can, however, assume values on any set. For example, ordered real and unordered categorical variables can be incorporated in the same regression equation. Variables of mixed type are admissible. As a tool for data analysis, the ACE procedure provides graphical output to indicate a need for transformations as well as to guide in their choice. If a particular plot suggests a familiar functional form for a transformation, then the data can be pre-transformed using this functional form and the ACE algorithm can be rerun. As with any regression procedure, a high degree of association between predictor variables can sometimes cause the individual transformation estimates to be highly variable, even though the complete model is reasonably stable. When this is suspected, running the algorithm on randomly selected subsets of the data, or on bootstrap samples can assist in assessing the variability. == References == * alt= This draft contains quotations from Estimating Optimal Transformations For Multiple Regression And Correlation By Leo Breiman And Jerome Freidman.

By definition, floating-point error cannot be eliminated, and, at best, can only be managed. H. M. Sierra noted in his 1956 patent \\"Floating Decimal Point Arithmetic Control Means for Calculator\\": The Z1, developed by Zuse in 1936, was the first computer with floating-point arithmetic and was thus susceptible to floating-point error. Early computers, however, with operation times measured in milliseconds, were incapable of solving large, complex problems and thus were seldom plagued with floating-point error. Today, however, with super computer system performance measured in petaflops, (1015) floating-point operations per second, floating-point error is a major concern for computational problem solvers. Further, there are two types of floating-point error, cancellation and rounding. Cancellation occurs when subtracting two similar numbers, and rounding occurs when significant bits cannot be saved and are rounded or truncated. Cancellation error is exponential relative to rounding error. The following sections describe the strengths and weaknesses of various means of mitigating floating-point error. == Numerical error analysis == Though not the primary focus of numerical analysis, numerical error analysis exists for the analysis and minimization of floating-point rounding error. Numerical error analysis generally does not account for cancellation error. == Monte Carlo arithmetic == Error analysis by Monte Carlo arithmetic is accomplished by repeatedly injecting small errors into an algorithm's data values and determining the relative effect on the results. == Extension of precision == Extension of precision is the use of larger representations of real values than the one initially considered. The IEEE 754 standard defines precision as the number of digits available to represent real numbers. A programming language can include single precision (32 bits), double precision (64 bits), and quadruple precision (128 bits). While extension of precision makes the effects of error less likely or less important, the true accuracy of the results are still unknown. == Variable length arithmetic == Variable length arithmetic represents numbers as a string of digits of variable length limited only by the memory available. Variable length arithmetic operations are considerably slower than fixed length format floating-point instructions. When high performance is not a requirement, but high precision is, variable length arithmetic can prove useful, though the actual accuracy of the result may not be known. == Use of the error term of a floating-point operation == The floating-point algorithm known as TwoSumhttps://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/robustr.pdf or 2Sum, due to Knuth and M√∏ller, and its simpler, but restricted version FastTwoSum or Fast2Sum (3 operations instead of 6), allow one to get the (exact) error term of a floating-point addition rounded to nearest. One can also obtain the (exact) error term of a floating-point multiplication rounded to nearest in 2 operations with a FMA, or 17 operations if the FMA is not available (with an algorithm due to Dekker). These error terms can be used in algorithms in order to improve the accuracy of the final result, e.g. with floating-point expansions or compensated algorithms. Operations giving the result of a floating-point addition or multiplication rounded to nearest with its error term (but slightly differing from algorithms mentioned above) have been standardized and recommended in the IEEE 754-2019 standard. == Choice of a different radix == Changing the radix, in particular from binary to decimal, can help to reduce the error and better control the rounding in some applications, such as financial applications. == Interval arithmetic == Interval arithmetic is an algorithm for bounding rounding and measurement errors. The algorithm results in two floating-point numbers representing the minimum and maximum limits for the real value represented. > \\"Instead of using a single floating-point number as approximation for the > value of a real variable in the mathematical model under investigation, > interval arithmetic acknowledges limited precision by associating with the > variable a set of reals as possible values. For ease of storage and > computation, these sets are restricted to intervals.\\" The evaluation of interval arithmetic expression may provide a large range of values, and may seriously overestimate the true error boundaries. == Gustafson's unums == Unums (\\"Universal Numbers\\") are an extension of variable length arithmetic proposed by John Gustafson. Unums have variable length fields for the exponent and significand lengths and error information is carried in a single bit, the ubit, representing possible error in the least significant bit of the significand (ULP). The efficacy of unums is questioned by William Kahan. == References == Category:Floating point Category:Computer arithmetic Category:Error ","title":"Floating-point error mitigation"},{"id":"56621874","text":"The 2005 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem was a women's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts in Rabat, Morocco that was part of the Tier IV category of the 2005 WTA Tour.

She was awarded Freedom of the City at the age of 74 and has a plaque to her memory in the Dundee City Chambers and a portrait by Alec Grieve is in the McManus Galleries and Museum. == Early life == Agnes Husband was born in Tayport, the daughter of a shipmaster John Husband and Agnes Lamond or Lomand. Agnes and her sister later worked as dressmakers in the Murraygate, Dundee. == Campaigning for socialism and women's suffrage == Agnes Husband became involved in her forties in socialism and the Labour party, standing unsuccessfully for election to the School Board in 1897. But in 1901 she was elected as one of the first two women on the Parochial Board. She attended over 80 meetings in a year serving on four committees. And in 1905 Husband did win a place on the School Board too and promoted providing meals, books, and nursery education to poor children in the city. Her own education continued in evening classes at Dundee University College and she became President of the Women's Freedom League (WFL) branch which started up in the city, and in 1909 she took a national role in the movement for women's suffrage. Agnes Husband attended and was able to give a first hand report on the demonstration which took place at Westminster but this was not reported in the local press. Annot Wilkie or Robinson appears to have been influenced by Husband. During Agnes Husband's presidency of Dundee WFL in October 1913 the branch joined with the local Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to demonstrate against forcible feeding at Dundee Prison. Agnes Husband Burgess Ticket awarded in 1926 In 1926 at the age of 74, she was the 5th woman to be given the Freedom of the City of Dundee. Husband's Burgess ticket was on display in the City Archives for the centenary of women's suffrage, and it says it was \\"in recognition of the valuable services rendered by her to the Community as a Member of the Parish Council and the Education Authority and in many other ways over a long period of years\\". She died in 1929. Agnes Husband's influence and link to the wider suffrage movement was described as > > \\"she worked long and conscientiously on behalf of the poor and for better > education. As a member of the suffrage movement, she spoke, wrote and > campaigned with gusto. She also supported and encouraged her younger sisters > to become involved.\\" == Death and legacy== In her obituary she was described as 'a pioneer in asserting the claims of women and their competence to participate in the administration of public affairs' and as ' a pioneer in more humane treatment of the poor and in education and care of children.' == See also == * Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom == References == Category:1852 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Scottish suffragists Category:Scottish suffragettes Category:British women's rights activists ","title":"Agnes Husband"},{"id":"56622189","text":"Frederick McIver (born 14 February 1952) was an English professional footballer who played as a midfielder for Sunderland. ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Birtley, Tyne and Wear Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Gateshead United F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Fred McIver"},{"id":"56622193","text":"Schlangenbach is a river of Bavaria, Germany.

She was of Hawaiian and Irish-English ancestry. Palama Settlement in Kalihi, where she had been the first head nurse of the program, eventually came under her authority at the Public Nursing Service. The Mabel Smyth Memorial Building in Honolulu, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was erected in her honor. ==Early life== She was raised on a Kona coffee plantation, and grew up in a bilingual household. Her mother, Julia, was of Hawaiian ancestry, and earned a living by making Lauhala hats. She inherited Irish-English ancestry from her father, sea captain Halford Hamill Smyth. Her older twin sisters were Mabel, who died in infancy, and Eva. When Mabel Leilani was born, she was given the name of her deceased sister. After Mabel, her sister Julia was born, followed by her brothers: Charles, Harry and Joseph. ==Nursing== Mabel Smyth Memorial Building in Honolulu Because her sister Eva was visually impaired, Mabel grew up in the role of care-giver. Sometime around the 1907 death of Captain Smyth, Mabel's family moved to Honolulu, where she completed her high school education. Mabel was counseled in her nursing career aspirations by Rev. Albert S. Baker, a medical doctor who was also her church pastor in Kona. He introduced her to James Arthur Rath and Ragna Helsher Rath who ran the health care facilities at Palama Settlement in Kalihi. Upon her graduation, Mabel was engaged as a care- giver for the Rath children on a 1911 trip to Massachusetts. She enrolled in the Springfield, Massachusetts Hospital Training School, returning to Hawaii after her 1915 graduation. Her first nursing assignment was in Kalihi Kae, before spending two years as a temporary director of the Hawaiian Humane Society, at that time an organization that provided care for both humans and animals. She was appointed at the first head nurse at Palama Settlement in 1918. In 1921, Mabel took a year's sabbatical from her duties at Palama for post-graduate work at Simmons College in Massachusetts. Upon her return, she continued at Palama Settlement until 1927, when she was appointed as the first director of Public Health Nursing, a newly established department under the Hawaii Territorial Board of Health. Prior to this, there had been a separate division under the board for tuberculosis-related issues. Another separate division for maternal and infant hygiene had been headed by Dr. Vivia B. Appleton who left for another appointment. When Mabel was approved by the Board, the two divisions were reorganized as the singular Department of Public Health Nursing. Based on a 1929 recommendation by Dr. Ira V. Hiscock of Yale University, following a two-month field survey of health care in Hawaii, the Palama Settlement was also brought under the Department of Public Health Nursing. During her career, she maintained memberships in the American Red Cross Nursing Service and the Hawaiian Civic Club. She was trustee of the Territorial Nurses Association and had served as president of the City and County of Honolulu Nurses Association. ==Death and legacy== Mabel died of a post-surgery embolism on March 24, 1936. The year following her death, a $100,000 memorial building was planned, financed through public fundraising. Designed by architect Charles William Dickey, the Mabel Smyth Memorial Building was officially opened January 4, 1941 on the grounds of The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu. It was listed on the NRHP Oahu on February 3, 1994. ==References== ==External links== * *Palama Settlement official site Category:1892 births Category:1936 deaths Category:American nursing administrators Category:Nursing educators Category:People of the Territory of Hawaii ","title":"Mabel Leilani Smyth"},{"id":"56622309","text":"Stefanie Posavec is a London-based information designer whose work focuses on non-traditional representations of data, born in 1981.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the early decades of the Empire, but they did not become prominent until the time of Commodus, in the late second century, from which period several of them attained positions of high distinction in the Roman state.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 640 (\\"Ragonius\\").PIR, vol. III, pp. 124, 125. ==Origin== The nomen Ragonius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix , typically of plebeian origin, and frequently of Oscan ancestry. Such names were originally formed from cognomina ending in -o, but once they became common, came to be regarded as a regular gentile-forming suffix, and was used in cases where it had no morphological justification.Chase, pp. 118, 119. The origin of Ragonius is obscure, but Chase suggests a possible etymological relationship to raga, a variation of braca, a harness, or, in the plural, breeches.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. braca. The occurrence of the Etruscan gentilicia Urinatius and Larcius, and the Latin Tuscenius in the nomenclature of two of the earlier Ragonii might point to an Etruscan origin, but given the period at which they appear, in all probability they refer to ancestors of this family in the female line.Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature in the Roman Empire. ==Branches and cognomina== The Ragonii used a variety of common surnames, including Celer, swift, Celsus, tall, Clarus, bright or famous, and Priscus, elder. The only distinct family of this gens passed down the surnames Quintianus and Venustus for several generations; Quintianus was probably an old agnomen, originally belonging to someone who was adopted out of the gens Quinctia, while Venustus, which entered the family through the female line, was applied to someone charming or attractive.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. celer, celsus, clarus, priscus, venustus. ==Members== * Ragonius Celer, the epistrategus, or military commander, serving under Titus Vitrasius Pollio, governor of Egypt in AD 31 and 32. * Lucius Ragonius L. f.

He is best known for his work at Blohm & Voss, where he worked as Head of New Projects under Chief Designer Richard Vogt during the World War II era. After the war, he moved the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, where he worked on a variety of projects. ==Early years== Hans Amtmann was born in Sande, on the outskirts of Bergedorf, near Hamburg in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in October 1906. He was the second of two brothers. From the age of nine he was educated at the Hansa School. During this time he learned to play the violin, before moving on to study naval architecture at the State Technical College in Hamburg. In his final term he took a course in aeronautics.Amtmann (1988) ==German aeroplane designer== After only one month working as a naval architect, Amtmann was offered a position as an aircraft designer at Junkers in Dessau. He worked on the wings of the G 38 and Ju 52 all-metal transports, and on in-flight refuelling, rocket-assisted take-off and preliminary design work. There he also met Hermann Pohlmann, who would go on to design the famous Ju 87 Stuka or dive-bomber before eventually becoming Amtmann's superior in another company. In 1933 Amtmann moved to Heinkel at Warnem√ºnde on the shores of the Baltic sea, where he worked on the fuselage of the He 70 transport before becoming involved once again on new project work. Wanting to return to Hamburg, Amtmann obtained a position as an aircraft designer at the newly established Hamburger Flugzeugbau, under the design leadership of Richard Vogt.William Green; Warplanes of the Third Reich, Fourth impression, Macdonald and Jane's, 1979, p. 69. He started work there as one of Vogt's first recruits, early in 1934, and was soon appointed Head of Preliminary Design. He would remain there, working on Vogt's great range of unconventional and ingenious ideas, throughout its official renaming as a subsidiary of Blohm & Voss shipbuilders, until it was shut down at the end of World War II in 1945. Due to the workload on Vogt, Amtmann's old colleague Pohlmann would later also join B&V; as Deputy Chief Designer, so becoming his immediate superior. He married Margret, whom he had known since his days as a naval architect, on 10 October 1934. They had four children; three boys and a girl. In 1941 he was awarded the War Merit Cross for his outstanding aircraft work.Amtmann (1988), p. 68. Amtmann was subsequently appointed project engineer for the proposed Blohm & Voss BV 237 stuka or dive-bomber attack aircraft, which had been personally approved by Hitler, but the order was obstructed by others and the work delayed until the war ended.Amtmann (1988), pp. 55, 63. He also took over and led the design of the P 200 transatlantic passenger flying boat project for Deutsche Luft Hansa, with the intention of building it when the war was over.Amtmann (1998) Pt.1, p.26. The BV 40 interceptor glider, flown in prototype form, gave him experience of the prone pilot position, which would help his later career. Immediately after the factory was shut down at the end of hostilities, B&V; kept a core design team together in rented rooms at a museum. But money soon ran out and Amtmann took a teaching job. ==American \\"paperclip\\"== In October 1946 Amtmann left his teaching job, having been recruited under the American Operation Paperclip to work in the US. Vogt would also be recruited, but Pohlmann would stay behind and later help to resurrect the Hamburger Flugzeugbau. Amtmann was sent to Wright Field, where he resumed work on a prone pilot bed, working for the biomedical facility under H. T. E. \\"Ed\\" Hertzberg.Charles A. Dempsey; 50 Years Of Research On Man In Flight, US Air Force, 1988. (retrieved 18 February 2018) Amtmann developed a patent control system for the pilot and the bed was test flown in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and later in a Lockheed F-80E Shooting Star jet fighter. During this work he also developed a protective shield for the pilot's helmet during emergency ejection which was widely adopted. Another invention was a flying fuel tank system in which the fuel tank glider was attached to the wing tips in parasite configuration. By a coincidence his erstwhile Chief, Richard Vogt, was also at Wright Field and came up with the same idea, beating Amtmann to the patent office. His family were eventually allowed to come over from Germany and join him early in 1948. But he did not become a legal immigrant until 1 January 1949. The paperwork had to be carried out at a border crossing, so the \\"Operation Paperclip\\" migrants were taken in batches, under military escort, across the Canadian border at Niagara Falls and then walked back over the bridge into the US, where they signed their immigration papers. He signed US citizenship papers in March. He escorted the rest of his family on the same exercise several months later and they received their papers in 1950. Amtmann left US Government employment in 1951, to work for Consolidated Vultee in San Diego, California, back in his old role of preliminary design. He worked on the Atlas ICBM system. Following a company separation or aero and missile divisions, under the new company name of Convair he developed the P6Y flying boat for the US Navy, but they withdrew the requirement. He was also involved in the Convair series of supersonic delta-winged jets, proposing his own design for a four-engined seaplane similar to, but larger than, the Convair F2Y Sea Dart. Made redundant in 1961, he joined General Atomic and worked on the Orion space propulsion system, which proposed using a controlled sequence of nuclear explosions to propel the spacecraft. He also worked on atomic-powered gas turbines.Colin F. McDonald, John C. Bass & Hans H. Amtmann; Primary System Design Studies for Advanced Direct Cycle Nuclear Gas Turbine Plant, AMSE, 1977. He moved to a small company working on nuclear fusion power in 1980, until the company closed in 1984. ==Retirement and death== Amtmann retired in 1984, following closure of the nuclear fusion company. During his time in California he had joined a small orchestra in which he once again played the violin. He wrote up his memoirs which were published in 1988 as The Vanishing Paperclips: America's Aerospace Secret ‚Äì a Personal Account. He appeared in the 1995 TV film documentary The Last Days of World War IIHans Amtmann, IMDb (retrieved 18 February 2018).

However, in the 1930s and 40s, a group of talented local artists was sent to study in Europe by the Ministry of Culture. On their return, these artists introduced modern styles such as impressionism to the local scene. They shared their experiences and knowledge of art by opening studios, providing art tuition, organising artists' collectives and exhibitions. Most of these artists taught in the modern style. They also consciously searched for a visual language that would integrate contemporary abstract art with Iraqi traditions and themes. These artists formed the nucleus of the group that founded the College of Fine Arts and became its first Faculty members.Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., \\"The Social Pattern,\\" in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures, p. 47 ==Origins== Its origins can be traced back to the Baghdad Conservatory founded in 1936. In 1940 the range of subjects studied was expanded to include acting, directing, painting and sculpture. In the same year, the name was changed to the Institute of Fine Arts. Then in 1958 it became the Academy of Fine Arts and premises were found in Bab Al-Moatham near the Medical City Teaching Hospital.

The best female racehorse of her generation in Britain, she was noted for her courage and consistency and in her prime she was described as a \\"fighting machine\\". She showed great promise as a two-year-old in 1926 when she won the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. In the following year she finished second in both the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks Stakes, before embarking on a six-race winning streak which included the Coronation Stakes, Nassau Stakes, St Leger and Jockey Club Stakes. As a four-year-old in 1928 she won the Burwell Stakes on her seasonal debut but then finished third in both the Coronation Cup and the Eclipse Stakes after which she was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Her foals included the top class colts Rhodes Scholar and Canon Law, the influential broodmare Highway Code and Archive, a racehorse of no account who sired Arkle. ==Background== Book Law was a bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. She was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stable at Manton, Wiltshire. She was sired by Buchan, who won the Eclipse Stakes, Champion Stakes and Doncaster Cup as well as finishing second in the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby. As a breeding stallion he made his mark as a sire of fillies including Short Story and the dams of Airborne and Sun Castle. Her dam Popingaol won two minor races but became a very successful broodmare whose other foals included Pogrom, Splendid Jay (Yorkshire Oaks), Book Debt (dam of Pay Up) and Fair Cop (female- line ancestor of Provoke). ==Racing career== ===1926: two-year-old season=== Book Law made her first impact in June 1926 when she contested the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot in which she was ridden by Robert A \\"Bobby\\" Jones and won at odds of 7/2. At Sandown Park in July she ran unplaced behind Pricilla in the National Breeders' Produce Stakes. In autumn she finished third to Applecross in the Moulton Stakes at Newmarket. Towards the end of the year she was described as the best horse of her age and sex in England. ===1927: three- year-old season=== Alec Taylor, Jr, who trained Book Law until the end of 1927 In a twenty-eight runner field for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 April, Book Law dead-heated for second place with Endowment, two lengths behind the winner Cresta Run. On 3 of June Book Law started the 5/2 favourite Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. She took the lead approaching the final turn but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a head by Beam in a \\"terrific race\\". Book Law was then dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile, which, with a first prize of ¬£4,750, was the most valuable run that year at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Henri Jellis she started the 4/9 favourite and won from Lord Furness's Gay Baby. The filly maintained her good form through the summer of 1927, taking the Welsh Oaks at Chepstow and the Gratwicke Stakes at Goodwood before winning the Nassau Stakes (again at Goodwood) at odds of 2/5. On 7 September, with Jellis in the saddle, Book Law started the 7/4 favourite in a field of sixteen colts and fillies for the 152nd running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. The race had been deprived of some interest by the absence of the Derby winner Call Boy, whose entry had been rendered void by the death of his owner. Racing on heavy ground Book Law was always in close contention before going to the front early in the straight. She repelled a challenge from the Derby runner-up Hot Night and drew away to win by three lengths with five lengths back to Son and Heir in third place. Three weeks after her Leger success, Book Law ended her second season with a run in the jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Newmaarket in which she was matched against older horses. Starting at odds of 4/6, she won by three quarters of a length from the four-year-old Foliation. By the end of 1927 she was being described as the best three-year-old in England of either sex. He earnings of ¬£22,316 made her easily the most financially successful horse of the year. When Alec Taylor the Manton stable was taken over by his assistant Joseph Lawson ===1928: four-year-old season=== Book Law began her second season by winning the Burwell Stakes over one and a half miles at Newmarket in May. At Epsom in June she started favourite for the Coronation Cup but began to struggle soon after half way and finished third behind the Italian-bred five-year-old Apelle. Both Lord Astor and Henri Jellis were bitterly disappointed by her performance, but it was subsequently found that she had been suffering from a \\"kidney infection\\". The filly missed an intended run in the Ascot Gold Cup but returned on 20 July for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown and finished third to Fairway and Royal Minstrel. Book Law's retirement was announced shortly after her defeat at Sandown. She ended her career with earnings of ¬£31,875, making her the fourth most successful female racehorse in British turf history up to that time behind Sceptre (¬£38,283), Pretty Polly (¬£36,638) and La Fleche (¬£34,703). ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Book Law an \\"average\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== Book Law was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Lord Astor's stud. Book Law died in November 1944 in a paddock accident at the Cliveden Stud. She produced at least ten foals between 1930 and 1944: *Canon Law, a bay colt, foaled in 1930, sired by Colorado. Won St James's Palace Stakes. *Law Maker, brown colt, 1931, by Phalaris *Rhodes Scholar, bay colt, 1933, by Pharos. Won Eclipse Stakes. *Light Sentence, chestnut filly, 1934 by Pharos. *Legal Fare, bay colt, 1935, by Manna *Sun Lore, bay colt, 1938, by Hyperion. Winner. *Highway Code, bay filly, 1939, by Hyperion.

After the reunification, the same level in both parts of the country was reached within a few years. Erika von Mutius suspected that the children had more contact with other children through their daycare in kindergarten. She stated in comparative studies that despite higher air pollution in Leipzig compared to Munich, the risk of asthma in children was not higher. She also found that children who grow up in the countryside and who are in contact with animals have a lower risk of allergies. ==Awards== In 2013, von Mutius was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize for \\"fundamental discoveries related to the formation and treatment of lung disease in children\\". * 1996: Award of the European Respiratory Society for Pediatric Respiratory Research in Europe * 1999: Elliot Ellis Lectureship at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Meeting * 2004: Robert Sauer Prize of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences * 2008: European Medal of the Bavarian State Chancellery * 2010: Honorary Doctor of the University of Helsinki *2011: Daniel Bovet Award for improving treatment and prevention of allergic diseases * 2013: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize * 2013: Cross of Merit on the ribbon of the Federal Republic of Germany * 2019: Balzan Prize == Memberships == * since 2014 Leopoldina * since 2016 member of the Academia Europaea * European Respiratory Society (ERS) * European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) == Editorships == Erika von Mutius is a member of the Editorial Board of the New England Journal of Medicine and editor of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the European Respiratory Journal. ==References== Category:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners Category:21st-century women scientists Category:German women scientists Category:Physicians from Munich Category:German pediatricians Category:Allergologists Category:Women pediatricians Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bonn Category:Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Erika von Mutius"},{"id":"56622814","text":"Kiln Wood is a nature reserve south of Lenham in Kent.

The March for Our Lives (MFOL) is a student-led demonstration in support of legislation to prevent gun violence in the United States.March for our lives. \\"March for Our Lives (Terms of Use)\\". (March, 2018). It took place in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 2018, with over 880 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world, and was planned by Never Again MSD in collaboration with the nonprofit organization. The event followed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting a month earlier, which was described by several media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation. Protesters urged for universal background checks on all gun sales, raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to 21, closing of the gun show loophole, a restoration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines and bump stocks in the United States. Turnout was estimated to be between 1.2 and 2 million people in the United States, making it one of the largest protests in American history. == Planning == Cameron Kasky at a rally in February 2018 Following the school shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and his classmates, announced the march four days later. Also joining the march efforts are Alex Wind of Stoneman Douglas High School, who along with four friends created the \\"Never Again\\" campaign. Emma Gonz√°lez and David Hogg, also survivors of the shooting, have been vocal supporters of the march. The date was chosen in order to give students, families and others a chance to mourn first, and then on March 24, talk about gun control. Organizers filed a permit application with the National Park Service during the week of February 23, and expected as many as 500,000 people to attend. However, the National Mall, which was the planned site of the main march in Washington, D.C., was reportedly already booked for March 24; the application, filed by an unidentified local student group, claimed it was for a talent show. A permit was later obtained for Pennsylvania Avenue. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced it would operate extra trains for the march. The Enough! National School Walkout was held on the one month anniversary of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. It involved students walking out from their classes for exactly 17 minutes (one for each of the victims of the massacre) and involved more than 3,000 schools across the United States and nearly one million students. Thousands of students also gathered and staged a rally in Washington, D.C., after observing 17 minutes of silence with their backs to the White House. After the success of the walkout, Hogg posted a tweet that included a provocative, NRA-style advertisement calling out lawmakers for their inaction on or opposition to gun control efforts, asking \\"What if our politicians weren't the bitch of the NRA?\\", and ending with a promotion for the upcoming March. === Celebrity and corporate support === George Clooney and Scooter Braun were major forces behind the organization of the march, and aided in fundraising efforts behind the scenes. Amal and George Clooney donated $500,000 to support the march and announced they would attend. Oprah Winfrey matched the Clooney donation to support the march. Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife Marilyn also contributed $500,000. Film director and producer Steven Spielberg and actress Kate Capshaw Spielberg donated $500,000, also matching the donation of the Clooneys. On February 23, Gucci announced they were also donating $500,000 towards the march. Other people and organizations offering support have included Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, Gabby Giffords, Lauren Jauregui, Alyssa Milano, Moms Demand Action, Amy Schumer, St. Vincent, Harry Styles, Hayley Williams, Paul McCartney, Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian. John Legend and Chrissy Teigen donated $25,000. Jimmy Fallon pledged to attend an event with his family. Samantha Bee interviewed kids. Jim Jefferies interviewed participants in San Diego. Other celebrities including Taylor Swift have donated an undisclosed amount of money toward the campaign. Justin Timberlake, Will Smith, Cher and Amy Poehler also participated in the March. James Corden promoted the March for Our Lives event. John Zimmer and Logan Green, the co-founders of Lyft, announced their support of the rallies and stated that their company would provide free rides for those attending demonstrations.

Estimates of participation at the main event in Washington, D.C., range from 200,000 to 800,000.

David Hogg tweeted out a video of Hunter's speech from a later event. Other participants included Naomi Wadler, who is an elementary school student in Alexandria, Virginia, Trevon Bosley from Chicago whose brother was shot and killed leaving church, Edna Lizbeth Ch√°vez, a high school student from Los Angeles, and Zion Kelly, whose twin brother was shot and killed during an armed robbery. Yolanda Renee King, granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr., also made an appearance along with Mya Middleton, a student from Chicago representing After School Matters, Matt Post, a senior from Montgomery County, Christopher Underwood, an 11-year old from New York, Alex King and D'Angelo McDade from Chicago, and Matthew Soto, brother of Sandy Hook victim Victoria Soto, and Parkaland parents Lori Alhadeff, who lost her daughter Alyssa in the school incident and Manuel & Patricia Oliver, whose lost their son Joaquin and launched a campaign titled \\"Change The Ref\\" to honor their son and push for new restrictions on any form of weapon violence. Emma Gonz√°lez seen on a Jumbotron in the distance during her moment of silence. Gonz√°lez, after speaking and naming the seventeen victims, stood silent for over four minutes, after which a cellphone alarm went off and she announced that it was the six minute and twenty second point in her speech, equal to the length of the Parkland shooting. Gonz√°lez ended her speech saying, then walked off stage as the entire crowd along Pennsylvania Avenue applauded loudly. Her speech and emotional moment of silence was praised by media organizations as one of the \\"most memorable\\" and \\"powerful\\" moments in the day's events. Singers Ariana Grande, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt, Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Hudson, Andra Day, Common, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato and Vic Mensa joined student-led marchers in Washington, D.C. Throughout the nation, other participators included Kanye West & Kim Kardashian George & Amal Clooney, Miley Cyrus' sister Noah, Steven Spielberg in D.C. as well as Arizona Representative Gabby Giffords, who survived weapon violence in the 2011 Tucson shooting, Laura Dern, Reese Witherspoon, Olivia Wilde with Jason Sudekis, Mason Cook, Jaden Smith, Yara Shahidi, Amy Schumer, Lady Gaga and Connie Britton in Los Angeles, along with city's Mayor Eric Garcetti and State Senator Kamala Harris, and Flo Rida and Emily Estefan in Miami Beach with Mayor Dan Gelber.

Kennedy, all of whom lost their lives from weapon violence) and Joseph Kennedy III in Boston, Senator Elizabeth Warren in Springfield, MA, and NY Governor Andrew Cuomo. Activists included Malala Yousafzai, who gave a warm introduction via a video monitor in during the Washington Event. == Responses == === National Rifle Association === A poster saying \\"Our children's safety should not have to be leveraged\\" On March 21, NRATV host Grant Stinchfield stated that \\"March for Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions\\"; fact- checker PolitiFact has rated this statement as being \\"without merit\\" and \\"Pants on Fire\\" indicating that it is a \\"ridiculous claim\\". While the march was occurring, the NRA posted a membership drive video on their Facebook page, declaring that the \\"protests aren't spontaneous. Gun-hating billionaires and Hollywood elites are manipulating and exploiting children as part of their plan to DESTROY the Second Amendment\\". Another video dubbed \\"A March for Their Lies\\" was uploaded to YouTube featuring Colion Noir, in which he described the planned rally as a \\"carnival of a march\\". Noir also said in the video that there is an \\"agenda that's a million times bigger than the guns\\". === Politicians === The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, leading the NYC March For Our Lives rally The Washington Post reported that there were many Democrats encouraging the marchers, and many of them, including candidates for office, participated from the sidelines in the march, but few Republicans did similarly. The White House said in a response that they \\"applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights\\". On the day of the protests, Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio responded by stating: \\"However, many other Americans do not support a gun ban\\" and \\"view banning guns as an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies\\". He called for protesters to find \\"common ground with those who hold opposing views\\" for change to happen. However, a blanket gun ban was not called for by the protests. Former Republican senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum criticized the Parkland activists, suggesting during an interview with CNN that students should be learning ways to respond to a shooter rather than asking lawmakers \\"to solve their problem\\"; Santorum advised students to take classes in CPR rather than marching in Washington. The Washington Post quoted several doctors responding to Santorum that CPR would not be at all effective on gunshot victims as they were suffering from blood loss. === Media === A report in The New Yorker praised the leaders of the march for their \\"extraordinary inclusiveness\\" in that they expanded the locus of concern from suburban schools to those of urban neighborhoods as well. On social media, fake pictures and GIFs of Emma Gonz√°lez tearing up a copy of the U.S. Constitution were circulated in an effort to discredit the march. The images were doctored from originals of Gonz√°lez tearing up a shooting target sign. Actor and conservative commentator Adam Baldwin defended circulating the doctored images as \\"political satire\\". == Use of social media == Previously, protests had occurred for multiple shootings in the United States, such as the 2015 Charleston church shooting, but never had they amassed more than several hundred participants. With social media, more information was relayed to a larger audience in quicker time, giving more people awareness of what was happening across the nation. By National Walkout Day on April 20, 2018, the social medias had followings over 1.3 million people and in Washington D.C. alone, 200,000 people attended the March For Our Lives protest, whom many younger adults attributed to the big social media presence. The hashtag #MarchForOurLives was used 3.6 million times, and over 7.5 thousand tweets were directed at the NRA social media account. === Twitter === The use of Twitter started when this movement originated after the Parkland shooting in Florida, where 17 individuals lost their lives. During the shooting, multiple students used Twitter, including freshman Aidan Minoff, who tweeted, \\"I am in a school shooting right now...\\" Twitter allowed others around the world to suddenly be aware of what was happening in real time and showing the raw emotion of these students. Twitter was a more \\"formal\\" news platform that supported greater two-way communication between the organization and the audience. The March For Our Lives Twitter started in February 2018, with the Twitter handle, @AMarch4OurLives. Up to date, the Twitter account has 450,000 followers and are a student-run organization with a large social media presence. The March For Our Lives Twitter has real time, up to date tweets about the movement. It includes tweets about the red flag bill being signed in from other March For Our Lives accounts based in different locations, such as NYC.Manhattan, March For Our Lives. ‚ÄúRed Flag Bill Signed Today in NYC !

Lady Gaga also documented the march, releasing a series of Instagram videos calling for action from politicians to enforce stricter gun laws. The march has drawn support from Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, and they have pledged to join and perform at the march. The students who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and millions of students worldwide participated in March for Our Lives, emerging as more influential on Instagram than celebrities on the gun control. One of the tools they used were the hashtags. Top hashtags such as #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain, #GunControlNow, and #EnoughIsEnough are used to spread the word and call on the public's attention. Instagram becomes an ‚Äòinformal‚Äô narrative platform that promoted a 'clicktivism' type of responses from the audience for the march. Besides, students collaborate with Bartle Bogle Hegarty(BBH) to create the first Instagram coloring book. BBH L.A. executive creative director Zach Hilder said, ‚Äúwe wanted to give them tools to elevate their voices, create a way to unify their message and allow everyone to participate in the march. That‚Äôs the inspiration for Color for Our Lives.‚Äù === Facebook === The March For Our Lives movement employs Facebook as another social media platform to spread awareness of its campaigns and messages to people around the world. As of March 5th 2019, nineteen days before the one yer anniversary of the protests, the MFOL Facebook page has garnered more than 300,000 followers. The page is mainly used to provide updates on national policies regarding gun laws, as well as coverage of various politicians who advocate for more gun safety. Similar to other media platforms, the Facebook page frequently employs popular hashtags such as #MarchForOurLives and #NeverAgain in its posts. Although other social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram often make posts to increase awareness, Facebook is more often used to organize people in nearby marches or demonstrations in major cities, and this has seen great success. For example, Facebook played a role in the March 24th 2018 March For Our Lives and Never Again collaboration gathering in Washington D.C., where more than 47,000 people marked themselves as \\"going,\\" and where more than 89 to 100,000 people nation and worldwide marked themselves as \\"interested\\" on the Facebook events posting. This shows the magnitude of Facebook as a platform for organizing unrelated people to gather together for the same cause. === Snapchat === The March For Our Lives movement leveraged Snapchat to gain momentum, spread the word and draw attention to what students and supporters were doing around the United States in response to recent shootings on school campuses. Unique from other social media platforms, Snapchat contains a map feature that allowed the world to see when and where activities by its users is taking place. This allowed the student walkouts to be easily tracked around the US.Bhardwaj, Prachi.

I truly am sorry, I did not mean to hurt anyone or cause any harm.\\" == Locations == === United States === ====Washington, D.C.==== Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. In anticipation and planning of the day's events, many streets in the nation's capital were closed to vehicle traffic. Several blocks of streets encompassing much of the National Mall, stretching from the Washington Monument to the United States Capitol and from Independence Avenue to E Street, were closed to vehicle traffic. Some of the rally-goers grouped at Trump Hotel, expressing displeasure that the Trump administration has not addressed school safety nor gun control in a meaningful way.Vince Reinhart. \\"https://www.flickr.com\\".

Boyer was best known for co-founding the band Cowboy. Boyer was born Chenango, New York, and moved to Jacksonville, Florida in his youth. After high school, he played in the band the 31st of February. He co-founded Cowboy with songwriter Tommy Talton in 1969, which released four albums and supported the Allman Brothers Band on tour. Boyer's song \\"Please Be with Me\\" was later covered by Eric Clapton. After Cowboy's breakup, Boyer continued playing music. He moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 1988 and continued playing in a band called the Decoys until his death in 2018. ==Life and career== Boyer was born in Chenango, New York. He first began receiving music lessons at age four, and he became interested in folk music through groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. He and his family later relocated to Louisville, Kentucky, and then Jacksonville, Florida. He graduated from Englewood High School, where he was a part of the school's orchestra. He then attended Florida State University studying viola, but dropped out. He later became a part of the group The Bitter Ind., which later changed their name to the 31st of February. In 1969, he and songwriter Tommy Talton formed the southern rock/country rock outfit Cowboy, which signed to Macon, Georgia-based Capricorn Records at guitarist Duane Allman's suggestion. The band relocated to Macon and subsequently released four albums‚ÄîReach for the Sky (1970), 5'll Getcha Ten (1971), Boyer & Talton (1974), and Cowboy (1977). Though they remained largely obscure, Cowboy supported the Allman Brothers Band on its tours and later served as the backing band for Gregg Allman's 1974 solo tour. \\"Please Be with Me\\", written by Boyer, later went on to be covered by Eric Clapton for his 1974 album 461 Ocean Boulevard. After Cowboy's dissolution in the late 1970s, Boyer continued to play music. He briefly moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote songs with Ricky Hirsch from Wet Willie, and produced an album for a band called the Sky Boys. He later joined a band called Locust Fork, and then another band called the Convertibles which briefly reunited him with Talton. He moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 1988 and began performing with the Decoys, a band founded by Johnny Sandlin, who produced Cowboy's albums as well as albums by the Allman Brothers and Widespread Panic. He released a solo album called All My Friends in 1991, and released a collaboration album with N.C. Thurman in 2012 titled Ok, How About This. He and Talton reformed Cowboy in 2007 and recorded an album's worth of material with Sandlin, but this material has never been released. They staged one more live performance as Cowboy in 2010, which was issued the following year as a live album, titled Boyer & Talton: Cowboy Reunion 2010. In 2007, Boyer was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. The Birmingham, Alabama-based Garage Caf√©‚Äîwhere the Decoys would often perform‚Äîhosted a benefit concert to help with his medical bills in 2013. Boyer died in Muscle Shoals on February 13, 2018. Talton said, \\"No one could write a more beautiful ballad than Scott Boyer. I love him and I miss him more than anything that can be said.\\" Singer- songwriter and Drive-By Truckers guitarist Jason Isbell, tweeted that \\"Scott Boyer was the first real songwriter that ever took me seriously.

It served as infantry at Gallipoli, fighting with distinction at the Third Battle of Krithia, and in some of the bitterest battles on the Western Front in World War I. After conversion into an anti-aircraft unit of the Royal Artillery between the wars, it defended Manchester, Scapa Flow and Ceylon during World War II and continued in the air defence role until 1955. ==Volunteer Force== The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Rupert Bonner, 'The Development of the Rifle Volunteer Movement in Manchester', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, 2008, Vol 86, No 347, pp. 216‚Äì35.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers. One such unit was the 6th Lancashire RVC raised at Manchester following a public meeting on 20 May 1859. The first 60 volunteers were sworn in on 7 June and began drilling at the Militia Barracks under staff sergeants of the 6th Lancashire Militia. The unit was formally accepted by the Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, the Earl of Sefton, on 25 August 1859. A number of large Manchester firms such as J.P. & E. Westhead (3rd Company) and J. & N. Philips (8th Company) provided whole companies from their employees, others came from the Manchester Cotton Exchange (4th Company) and from the Athenaeum Gymnastic Club (5th (1st Athenaeum) Company under Captain William Romaine Callender). Volunteers from the townships of Hulme, Moss Side, Cornbrook and Stretford, including groups from the Commercial Mills at Hulme and from T.G. Hill & Co, formed a 7th (Old Trafford) Company. The 6th Lancashire RVC soon had a strength of 12 companies. Viscount Grey de Wilton was appointed Lieutenant- Colonel Commandant on 19 February 1860 and by the following month the unit had adopted the additional title of 1st Manchester Rifles. The 2nd and 3rd Manchester Rifles and the Ardwick Artizan Rifles (numbered as the 28th, 40th and 33rd Lancashire RVCs respectively) also appeared at this time, making up an unofficial Manchester Brigade at the Volunteer reviews.Beckett, pp. 59, 70 and Appendix VIIFrederick, pp. 131‚Äì2.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 141‚Äì2, 149.Lancashire Record Office Handlist 726th Manchesters at Regiments.org. The 1st Manchester Rifle Volunteers opened its headquarters (HQ) in Hopwood Avenue and its members drilled in various warehouses, in Carpenter's Hall, the Bazaar in Bridge Street, at Salford Dyeworks, and at the Cavalry Barracks in Hulme. The Old Trafford company paraded at Pomona Gardens and later at the Infantry Barracks at Salford, where they drilled under Regular Army staff sergeants of the 96th Regiment. The majority of volunteers enrolled in the unit were warehousemen and clerks. The uniform was scarlet with yellow facings.Army Lists In October 1860, No 12 Company, based at Eccles, transferred to the 46th Lancashire RVC at Swinton but the following year the 6th absorbed the 43rd Lancashire RVC, originally raised on 11 February 1860 at Fallowfield. In March 1865 the 1st Manchesters moved their HQ to an office at 1 Brown Street, and then in July the following year to Wolstenholme's Court, Market Street, Manchester, where it stayed for a number of years. Drills were carried out at Barker's Riding School in Greenheys. From the 1880s the HQ and drill hall was at 3 Stretford Road, Hulme. Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, the 6th was linked with other Manchester-based RVCs, Militia regiments and the Regular 63rd and 96th Foot into Brigade No 16 (Lancashire). When the 63rd and 96th were amalgamated to create the Manchester Regiment in 1881 as part of the Childers Reforms, the 6th Lancashire RVC was formally attached to it as a Volunteer Batalion on 1 July, and changed its designation to 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Manchester Regiment on 1 September 1887. Under the mobilisation plan introduced by the Stanhope Memorandum in 1891,Dunlop, Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. the five (later six) Volunteer Battalions of the regiment constituted the Manchester Brigade. Between 1887 and 1908 the 2nd VB maintained a Mounted infantry company. Volunteers from the battalion served in a Service Company alongside the Regulars of the regiment during the Second Boer War, gaining the battalion its first Battle Honour South Africa 1900‚Äì1902.Leslie. According to their memorial, 157 men of the 2nd VB served during the war, of whom six died on active service.IWM War Memorials Register Ref 3286. ==Territorial Force== When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 2nd Volunteer Battalion became the 6th Battalion, Manchester Regiment, except 'N' Company at Manchester University, which became part of the Officers' Training Corps and was the forerunner of today's Manchester & Salford University OTC. The Manchester Brigade became part of the East Lancashire Division of the TF.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 35‚Äì41.42 Division at Long, Long Trail.42 Division at Regimental Warpath. ==World War I== ===Mobilisation=== Brass shoulder title of 6th Bn Manchester Regiment (TF), World War I era On the outbreak of war, the division was at its annual camp when the order to mobilise was received at 05.30 on 4 August. The units returned to their drill halls to mobilise, the men being billeted close by. On 20 August, having volunteered for overseas service, the division moved into camps for training, and on 9 September it entrained for Southampton to embark for Egypt. 6th Manchesters were under Lt-Col G.G.P. Heywood, who had been commanding officer (CO) since 1 September 1911.Manchester Rgt at Long, Long TrailManchester Rgt at Regimental Warpath.'Territorial Force 1914‚Äì1919' at Museum of the Manchester Regiment.Gibbon, pp. 4‚Äì7. On 31 August 1914, the formation of Reserve or 2nd Line units for each existing TF unit was authorised. Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, and the recruits who were flooding in. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right. From now on, the original battalion was designated the 1/6th Manchesters, and the 2nd Line was the 2/6th; later a 3rd line battalion was formed.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 67‚Äì74. ===1/6th Battalion=== The East Lancashire Division began to disembark at Alexandria on 25 September and the 6th Manchesters went into garrison at Mustapha Barracks in that city. At first the division's role was simply to relieve Regular troops from the garrison for service on the Western Front, but on 5 November Britain declared war on Turkey and Egypt became a war zone. While the East Lancashire Division went to guard the Suez Canal, the Manchester Bde was detached to garrison Cairo.Gibbon, pp. 7‚Äì13.IWM War Memorial Regiser Ref 18575. ====Gallipoli==== On 3 May 1915 the battalion (under the command of Major C.R. Pilkington, Lt-Col Heywood being unfit) embarked at Alexandria on the SS Derfflinger, a captured German Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping line vessel that had just arrived with a cargo of wounded from the initial landings at Gallipoli. Derfflinger missed her intended landing spot at Cape Helles, and so the Manchesters arrived late on 6 May, after the rest of the division had gone into action. The 1/6th Bn bivouacked above 'W' Beach ('Lancashire Landing') and during the night of 7/8 May was moved, with ammunition, rations and entrenching equipment, but no blankets or baggage, to the Krithia sector, where the men went into the firing line for a 10-day period. On 12 May the brigade made a feint attack to attract attention away from a movement elsewhereWestlake, Gallipoli, pp. 185‚Äì6.Gibbon, pp. 17‚Äì28. On 25 May, the East Lancashire Division was formally designated 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, and the Manchester Brigade became 127th (Manchester) Brigade.Gibbon, p. 33. During another spell in front of Krithia beginning on 25 May, the 1/6th and 1/5th Manchesters advanced their line between 50 and . The lines were now within assaulting distance of the nearest Turkish trenches, and a new attack (the Third Battle of Krithia) was launched on 4 June. After a bombardment starting at 08.00, the assault was launched at noon. The Manchester Brigade led 42nd Division's attack, with half of 1/6th Bn on the left, and in this sector all went well to begin with: despite intense rifle and machine gun fire the brigade took all its first objectives, the second wave passing through and parties advancing up to into the Turkish fourth line. The Official History records that 'The Manchester Territorials, fighting like veterans, were all in high fettle'. There was almost nothing between them and Krithia, and beyond that the ultimate target of Achi Baba. However, things had gone disastrously wrong for 127 Bde's neighbours, and the Turks were counter-attacking both flanks. C Company of 1/6th Bn, which had advanced furthest, was cut off and practically wiped out. Although the Manchesters held on to the first Turkish line they had captured, casualties had been severe, and only 160 out of 770 men of 1/6th Bn answered evening roll-call. The Manchesters consolidated their position on 5 June before being relieved that night and going into reserve.Aspinall-Oglander, pp. 41‚Äì54.Carver. pp.49‚Äì50.Gibbon, pp. 35‚Äì9. On 12 June the Manchester Brigade was withdrawn from the Gallipoli Peninsula and went to the island of Imbros for rest. It returned to Cape Helles on 22 June and 1/6th Bn went up to the firing line in the Krithia Nullah sector on 24 June. They held the Turkish trench they had captured while the formations on either flank attempted to improve their positions. The sector was given trench names reminiscent of home: 'Stretford Road', 'Greenheys Lane', 'Ardwick Green', etc. The 1/6th Manchesters then spent the next six weeks alternating in the line with 1/5th and 1/8th Bns, taking casualties steadily.Sergeant Harry Hopwood, 1/6th Manchesters, 1 July 1916, quoted in Carver, pp. 53‚Äì4.Gbbon, p. 41. The original grave at Gallipoli of Capt Harold Cawley, MP. A new attack at Helles (the Battle of Krithia Vineyard) began in August. 42nd Division delivered its main attack at 09.45 on 7 August, but despite the bombardment and assistance from machine guns and trench mortars, 127 Bde could make little progress. 1/6th Manchesters, described by the divisional commander as 'that fine battalion', seized a Turkish redoubt in Krithia Nullah and held it 'until they were practically annihilated'. By 19.15 that evening the Manchesters were back in their old positions. 127th Brigade was temporarily unfit for service and its total strength was only that of a single battalion, though it relieved 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade on 8/9 August and continued the fight, with 1/6th Bn doing good work in defending a trench near Krithia Vineyard. After a short rest and receiving a few drafts and returning casualties, the division was put back into the line on 19 August, still badly under strength and suffering from sickness. The 1/5th and 1/6th Manchesters were temporarily combined under the command of Lt-Col Pilkington.Aspinall- Oglander, p. 173.Gibbon, pp. 43‚Äì9. During September the Turks exploded a series of mines in front of the British trench known as the 'Gridiron' and damaging its defences. Repairs after one mine on 22 September were covered by a bombing party of 1/6th Manchesters who held the lip of the crater. The same day the Royal Engineers exploded a counter-mine and the Manchesters rushed the crater and built a barrier across it. Captain Harold Cawley of 1/6th Bn, the Member of parliament for Heywood, was killed that night by a Turkish sniper, and the crater became known as 'Cawley's Crater'. The division continued to hold its position, suffering casualties from mining and bad weather, until its infantry were evacuated to Mudros on 29 December.Gibbon, pp. 49‚Äì59. ====Romani==== The Battle of Romani 3‚Äì4 August 1916. The Gallipoli Campaign was shut down at the beginning of January, but 42nd Division remained on Mudros until the middle of the month before returning to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) and the Suez Canal defences. From February to 1916 it was stationed at Shallufa, base for the Southern Sector of the defences, broken by spells of training in the desert. In June the division was moved to the Central Sector, between Ismailia and Qantara. In July, 42nd Division became part of a Mobile Column (under Maj-Gen Hon Herbert Lawrence, former brigadier of 127 Bde) formed to counter a threatened Turkish thrust across the Sinai desert before it reached the canal. 127 Brigade was the advanced brigade of this force, and on 3 August 1/6th Manchesters moved to Pelusium, six miles north-west of Romani to prepare defences to cover the railhead for the arrival of the rest of the brigade. The Battle of Romani opened early on the morning of 4 August, and the rest of 127 Bde was rushed up, passing through 1/6th Manchesters to support the Anzac Mounted Division, which was heavily engaged. That night the 1/6th Manchesters escorted the camel transport carrying vital water and supplies up to the front line troops, and then rejoined 127 Bde. During 5 and 6 August the brigade pursued the defeated Turkish force, suffering badly from extreme heat and lack of water, with many men falling out through exhaustion, until it reached Qatiya.Gibbon, pp. 63‚Äì78. During the Autumn the railway and water pipeline were pushed forward, and 42nd Division participated in the EEF's Advance to Wadi el Arish, which began in late November 1916 and completed the Sinai Campaign in January 1917.Gibbon, pp. 79‚Äì82. ====Western Front==== 42nd Division was now ordered to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. In early February 1917 it returned to Egypt and by 2 March the last troopship had left for France. The troops were concentrated at Pont-Remy, near Abbeville, and re-equipped; the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield rifle was issued in place of the obsolescent long model with which the battalions had gone to war. The division was employed on working parties in the area abandoned by the Germans when they retired to the Hindenburg Line, and then the brigades started taking turns in the line near Havrincourt Wood. On the night of 8/9 June all four battalions of the Manchesters went into No man's land to dig a new trench closer to the enemy line, which was completed and occupied the following night. The battalions also carried out regular night patrols and raids.Gibbon, pp. 83‚Äì95. From 9 July to 22 August the division was in reserve, with 127 Bde stationed at Achiet-le-Petit. It then moved to the Ypres Salient to join the Third Ypres Offensive, passing through the Menin Gate on the night of 1 September. On 6 September 125 (Lancashire Fusiliers) Bde made an attack, with 1/6th Manchesters attached to provide carrying parties. After the failed attack, the Manchesters carried many of the Lancashire Fusiliers' dead back for burial.Gibbon, pp. 96‚Äì102. After 18 days in the Salient, the division was relieved and moved to the Nieuport Sector on the Belgian coast, where it remained under constant shellfire until November. It then moved to the La Bass√©e‚ÄìB√©thune sector where it spent the winter building concrete defences to replace the existing poor breastworks.Gibbon, pp. 102‚Äì22. The BEF was now suffering a manpower crisis, and in February 1918 around a quarter of its battalions were disbanded to reinforce others; the Manchesters absorbed drafts from the disbanded 1/9th and 2/10th Bns.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 67‚Äì74.Gibbon, pp. 122‚Äì7. ====Spring Offensive==== When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 42nd Division was in reserve, and on 23 March it was sent south in motor buses to reinforce Third Army. 127 Brigade debussed at midnight on the Ayette‚ÄìDouchy road and set up an outpost line. The following day the division was ordered to relieve 40th Division, and 127 Bde advanced in artillery formation across open ground to take up its positions. At dawn on 25 March the Germans attacked, making some penetrations but being stopped by the Manchesters. On reports that another attack was assembling SE of Bihucourt, 1/6th Manchesters sent a company there. This arrived simultaneously with the Germans and immediately made two attacks on them, finally being forced out of the village by superior numbers. This action gave time for reinforcements to stop the enemy advancing beyond Bihucourt to Achiet-le-Grand, which the CO of 1/6th Manchesters was ordered to prevent at all costs.Gibbon, pp. 128‚Äì35. By 26 March the enemy was working round the division's flanks, and it was ordered to pull back to the Bucquoy‚ÄìAblainzevelle line; 127 Brigade slipped away unnoticed. The German advance was held in front of Bucquoy, despite heavy shellfire, and on the night of 27/28 March 1/6th Manchesters sent an aggressive patrol back into Ablainzevelle, which caused casualties and disruption. The following day the battalion counter-attacked again, breaking up another German attack, and held the line all day. During one of the hottest attacks Corporal A. Brooks noticed that his men were running short of rifle oil and suffering jams, so he calmly went up and down the line with an oil can, lubricating rifle bolts while under fire. The first stage of the German offensive had been checked, although shellfire and raiding continued along the line until the division was relieved on 8 April.Gibbon, pp. 135‚Äì40. When the division returned to the line front, the Third Army line was relatively quiet, the Germans having switched their offensive to the north. The policy was now to advance the line by means of small raids and aggressive patrolling (so- called 'peaceful penetration') and 1/6th Manchesters actively advanced by these means between 20 and 24 July, and in August held off determined attacks on these positions. In July the division was struck by the flu epidemic, but did receive some drafts: on 31 July the 1/6th Manchesters absorbed the remaining cadre of the 2/6th Manchesters from 66th Division (see below), and thereafter was simply referred to as the 6th Bn.Gibbon, pp. 142‚Äì54. ====Hundred Days Offensive==== The Allied counter-offensive began with the Battle of Amiens (8‚Äì12 August), as a result of which the Germans began to give ground, and 42nd Division followed up against rearguards. Third Army began its formal assault (the Battle of Albert) on 21 August. 125 Brigade advance behind a creeping barrage onto its first objective, then the barrage switched to precede 127 Brigade advancing with 6th Manchesters on the right. Assisted by morning mist, the Manchesters took their first objective, and then cleared the ravine in which the Beaucourt‚ÄìPuisieux road ran, the men getting to close quarter fighting with the defenders. However, it took two attempts for the brigades to take their third objective, the Manchesters finally advancing along the ridge up to Miraumont. A counter-attack from Miraumont at 04.15 the following morning was shattered by the Manchesters, as were two more against the division that day. On 24 August the Manchesters worked round Miraumont, 6th Bn securing fords over the River Ancre, and large numbers of prisoners were taken. The division continued to advance slowly against rearguards until the end of the month. Lieutenant-Colonel T. Blatherwick, commanding 6th Manchesters, was awarded a DSO for making reconnaissances under fire. On 2 September 127 Bde put in an attack on Villers-au-Flos with support from tanks, aircraft, mortars and a creeping barrage, 6th Bn on the left making good progress as the village was enveloped and cleared. The division then exploited this success, and a period of open warfare ensued, with cavalry going into action.Gibbon, pp. 155‚Äì65. After a period of rest, the division returned to the line for the set-piece assault on the Hindenburg Line (the Battle of the Canal du Nord). 127 Brigade advanced at 08.20 on 27 September with 5th Manchesters leading over the Trescault Ridge to the first objective, after which 6th and 7th Bns passed through to the second and third objectives despite losses from machine guns. By 14.30, a weak company of the 6th Manchesters was on the fourth objective. The 6th and 7th Battalions were now too weak to attempt the final objective, but it was taken that night by the rest of the division, which continued to advance the following morning.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 43‚Äì4.Gibbon, pp. 173‚Äì7. 42nd Division next participated in the Battle of the Selle. The divisional Royal Engineers bridged the River Selle on the nights of 17‚Äì19 October and the attack went in at 02.00 on 20 October. 127 Brigade set off at 07.00 and passed through towards the second objective. Although the leading company of 6th Manchesters suffered casualties from machine gun nests, these were successfully cleared out and the battalion captured the village of Marou. Although the men of 6th Bn were anxious to carry on to the third objective, they were ordered to consolidate until the 5th Bn on their right could catch up. The Germans massed for a counter-attack at midday, but this was broken up by artillery and machine gun fire and 127 Bde captured its final objective that afternoon. When the advance was resumed on 23 October 127 Bde was in support. During the subsequent pursuit (3‚Äì11 November), it remained in support, marching through the Forest of Mormal and across the River Sambre behind 42nd Division's advanced guards until the Armistice with Germany came into effect on 11 November.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 339, 364‚Äì5, 552‚Äì3.Gibbon, pp. 180‚Äì97. 42nd Division remained at Hautmont on the Sambre during November, then moved to Charleroi where demobilisation began. As the men went home the division's units were reduced to cadres by 16 March 1919, and 6th Bn was disembodied on 10 April. ====Commanding officers==== The following officers served as CO of the 1/6th Manchesters during the war:Gibbon, p. 245. * Lt-Col G.G.P. Heywood * Lt-Col C.R. Pilkington, CMG * Lt-Col C.S. Worthington, DSO, TD * Lt-Col G.H. Wedgwood, DSO (promoted to command 126th (East Lancashire) Brigade 25 May 1918) * Lt-Col T. Blatherwick, DSO, MC ===2/6th Battalion=== The 2/6th Bn was formed at Hulme in August 1914 and shortly afterwards was included in the 2/1st Manchester Brigade of 2nd East Lancashire Division. There was a great shortage of arms and equipment, and the 2nd Line Lancashire units had to train with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles until the end of 1915. Training was also interrupted by the need to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1/6th Bn overseas. It was not until August 1915 that the division (now numbered as the 66th (2nd East Lancashire), with the 2/1st Manchester Bde as 199 (Manchester)) was able to concentrate in Kent and Sussex. By the end of the month all Home Service men had left to join Provisional Battalions (see below). Early in 1916 the division was transferred to coastal defence duties in East Anglia, but training was still hindered by the requirement to supply drafts to the 42nd Division. It was not until 1 January 1917 that the division was declared ready for overseas service.66 Div at Long, Long Trail66 Div at Regimental Warpath. The division began embarking at the end of February, and was concentrated at Berguette and Thiennes by 16 March. It served in the desultory operations along the Flanders coast in the summer, then moved to the Ypres salient in October to join the Third Ypres Offensive. ====Poelcapelle==== A street corner in Poelcapelle, 1917. The division's first attack was on 9 October at the Battle of Poelcappelle. Its role was to advance up a ridge to the outskirts of the village of Passchendaele. Ground conditions were bad, but it was believed that there was no German wire to negotiate. The division began its approach march at 19.00 the evening before, and was expected to be resting at its jumping-off line by midnight. But the mud was so bad that the troops arrived 20 minutes after the attack was launched, and simply fixed bayonets and kept walking. As well as the mud, which seriously hindered movement, clogged weapons and deadened artillery fire, they were faced by unanticipated barbed wire. The artillery had made no impression on German pillboxes. Although patrols from 66th Division did reach Passchendaele, by the end of the day all temporary gains had been wiped out, and the division did note even hold a consolidated line.Wolff, pp. 223‚Äì7, 230-2, 248.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres' in Liddle (ed), pp. 221, 224.Ashley Eakins, 'The Australians at Passchendaele', in Liddle (ed), pp. 239‚Äì42. ====Operation Michael==== When the German Spring Offensive opened, 66th Division had recently been moved from Ypres to Fifth Army and was holding a line among the undulating valleys of the River Somme's tributaries. Reconnaissance had revealed strange new holes in No man's land, which turned out to be forming-up points for the German Stormtroopers. The divisional front was held by three battalions in the Forward Zone and three out of the other six in the Battle Zone. 2/6th Manchesters was among the battalions held back from the Battle Zone, but the divisional commander had forbidden them to move into position until the battle actually started. Aided by early morning fog, the German attack on 21 March quickly broke through the Forward Zone, isolating the battalions, and continued into the Battle Zone.Middlebrook, pp. 112, 201.Murland, pp. 74, 84. German flamethrower troops 1914‚Äì18 The Manchesters now had to march up to their allotted positions under gas shelling, 2/6th Bn moving up the hill from Montigny towards Hervilly, which was under heavy shellfire, and into Hervilly Wood. Casualties had been light so far, but between 11.00 and 11.15 the Germans advancing in the fog split the battalion and surrounded both A and C Companies. Battalion HQ formed a defensive line and 2/6th Manchesters held on at Fervague Farm for several hours, until driven out at 13.00 by flamethrowers. Many of the survivors were captured, and when the battalion reached Carpenza Copse it consisted of only 12 officers and 150 men. Here, under the command of Maj John Whitworth and joined by some dismounted cavalry, they held on doggedly until 14.00 on 22 March before falling back under cover of fog to the 'Green Line' at H√©b√©court, where 50th (Northumbrian) Division was hurriedly digging in.Blaxland, pp. 56‚Äì7.Middlebrook, pp. 159‚Äì60, 230, 375-8.Murland, pp. 74, 84‚Äì5, 156‚Äì7. The remnants of 66th Division took up position on the Somme Canal at P√©ronne, where 2/5th and 2/6th Manchesters held 'Bristol Bridge' for the retiring rearguards of 16th (Irish) Division until the Germans entered Peronne late on 24 March. The bridge was then demolished at 18.00 by 180th Tunnelling Company, RE, and the retreat continued to Rosi√®res, where the division narrowly escaped being surrounded, until Germans were halted by a new defence line on the River Luce.Blaxland, pp. 86, 94‚Äì7.Murland, pp. 162, 165, 193‚Äì7. 66th Division had suffered some of the heaviest casualties during the battle, and in April its battered battalions were reduced to training cadres. 2/6th Manchesters was disbanded on 31 July, the remaining personnel being transferred to the 1/6th Bn in 42nd Division. ===3/6th Battalion=== This battalion was formed at Hulme in March 1915, with the role of training drafts for the 1/6th and 2/6th Bns. Early in 1916 it moved to Witley. On 8 April that year it was renamed the 6th Reserve Bn, Manchester Regiment, and on 1 September it was absorbed into the 5th Reserve Bn.Training Battalions at Regimental Warpath. ===28th Battalion=== The Home Service men of the 6th Manchesters, together with those of other TF battalions of the Manchesters and Lancashire Fusiliers, were combined into 45th Provisional Battalion, which became 28th Manchesters on 1 January 1917. It served in 73rd Division and was disbanded in 1918.Army Council Instructions, January 1916, Appendix 18.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 111‚Äì6. ==Interwar== 42nd (East Lancashire) Division began reforming at home in April 1920. When the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the 6th Manchesters was combined with the 7th Battalion (originally the 3rd Manchester RVC) and reformed at Hulme as the 6th/7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment in 127 (Manchester) Brigade of 42nd Division on 31 December.Manchester Rgt at Regiments.orgTitles & Designations 1927'Territorial Army 1920-‚Äì1945' at Museum of the Manchester Regiment. In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA brigades of the Royal Artillery (RA). The 6th/7th Manchesters was one unit selected for this role, becoming 65th (The Manchester Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA (TA) on 10 December 1936, still based at Hulme.Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì9, 771.Litchfield, p. 131. The unit consisted of 181, 182, 183 and 196 Batteries, and initially formed part of 33rd (Western) Anti- Aircraft Group in 2nd AA Division. On 1 January 1939 the RA adopted the more normal terminology of 'regiment' instead of 'brigade', which allowed the AA groups to adopt the designation of 'brigades'. By then, the 33rd AA Bde had moved to 4th AA Division in Anti-Aircraft Command, and by the outbreak of war in September, 65th AA Regiment had moved to a new 44 AA Brigade within 4 AA Division.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files (On 31 July 1939, as part of the doubling in size of the TA before the outbreak of war, new 6th and 7th Battalions of the Manchester Regiment were created as duplicates of the 5th and 8th (Ardwick) Battalions respectively; these served as infantry during World War II.) ==World War II== ===Mobilisation and Phoney War=== The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. 65th AA Regiment was at a practice camp at Burrow Head in Scotland when AA Command was fully mobilised on 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war. It immediately travelled back to man its war stations and was joined by its attached Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) company, which had been training at Manorbier in Wales.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371.44 AA Bde War Diary 1939‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2282. Initially, the regiment manned sites with old 3-inch guns and a few modern 3.7-inch static guns. The first 4.5-inch guns began arriving in November. Surplus men manned Lewis light machine guns (LMGs) at Vital Points (VPs) including 181 Bty at Kearsley Power Station. A single 3-inch gun of the regiment was posted at Baxter's respirator (gas mask) factory at Leyland. By November the regiment was distributed as follows: Static 3.7-inch HAA gun, preserved at Nothe Fort. * 181 Bty: De Havilland factory at Lostock ‚Äì 24 x LMGs * 182 Bty: Manchester docks and Anglo-American Oil Co ‚Äì 32 LMGs * 183 Bty: ** B Gunsite, Harpurhey ‚Äì 4 x 4.5-inch ** H Gunsite, Belle Vue ‚Äì 4 x 3.7-inch * 196 Bty: ** G Gunsite, Chorlton ‚Äì 2 x 3-inch ** J Gunsite, Peel Green ‚Äì 2 x 3-inch ** M Gunsite, Pendlebury ‚Äì 2 x 3-inch 196 Battery fired the regiment's first shots on 17 November when J Gunsite engaged a single Heinkel He 111 that entered the area. The VPs were soon taken over by specialist Light AA (LAA) units. On 1 June 1940, the RA's AA regiments were redesignated Heavy AA (HAA) to distinguish them from the newer LAA units being formed, the 65th becoming 65th (The Manchester Regiment) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. ===Battle of Britain=== In June 1940, after the end of the Phoney War and the Dunkirk evacuation, 65th HAA Rgt was distributed as follows: 4.5-inch HAA gun, 1941. * RHQ: Stretford Road * 181 HAA Bty: ** A, G & D Gunsites, Manchester ** Three sections detached to 33 AA Bde at Liverpool ** One section guarding Tycroes practice camp * 182 HAA Bty: ** E Gunsite, Belle Vue ** H Gunsite, Stretford ** Detachment at Ringway Aerodrome * 183 HAA Bty: ** B Gunsite, Harpurhey ** F Gunsite, Chorlton * 196 HAA Bty ** J Gunsite, Peel Green ** M Gunsite, Pendleton During the height of the post-Dunkirk invasion scare in July 1940, 181 HAA Bty was temporarily detached to 6th HAA Rgt in 2 AA Bde in Kent. This regiment was involved in a defence scheme codenamed 'Bovril' to defend roads leading inland from possible invasion sites on the South Coast and was also reconnoitring the area for future AA gunsites.2 AA Bde War Diary, Home Forces 1940, TNA file WO 166/2221.Walker, p. 39. In August, 181 HAA Bty was once again attached to 6th HAA Rgt, now stationed in the West Midlands, to allow that regiment's batteries to attend practice camps. It manned gunsites H1 at Coven Heath and H18 at Merry Hill.Walker, p. 96. As the Battle of Britain progressed, small numbers of Luftwaffe bombers appeared over North West England by day and night, leading to a few AA engagements and a small amount of damage. These increased in late August, with considerable damage in the Bolton and Chorley areas on the night of 28/29 August. Gunsites B and J opened fire using the new GL Mk I gunlaying radar, causing some raiders to take evasive action. ===Home Defence=== At the beginning of October, 65th HAA Rgt went to the Orkney & Shetland Defence Force (OSDEF), where it served in 58 AA Bde defending the naval base at Scapa Flow.Routledge, Table LXV, pp. 396‚Äì7.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 1940, TNA file WO 212/114.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 3 March 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/115.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.OSDEF at RA 39‚Äì45 The regiment supplied a cadres of experienced officers and other ranks to provide the basis for a new 402 HAA Bty formed on 12 December 1940 at 210th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, which joined 123rd HAA Rgt. It regiment provided another cadre to 211th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, which formed 432 HAA Bty on 8 May 1941. This battery did return to 65th HAA Rgt on 6 August, replacing 182 Bty transferred to newly-formed 128th HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 784.Farndale, Annex M. The regiment returned to mainland UK in June 1941, joining 34 AA Bde defending Birmingham and Coventry in 11 AA Division.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments,TNA file WO 212/80. In the autumn of 1941 the regiment moved again, joining 51 AA Bde in 3 AA Division in Scotland. On 4 November 1941, 432 HAA Bty transferred to 136th HAA Rgt and was replaced by 465 HAA Bty, also from a cadre supplied by the regiment and formed at 209th HAA Training Rgt at Blandford on 7 August. The regiment then left AA Command in December and joined the War Office Reserve, preparatory to going overseas. The war establishment for overseas service was three batteries, so 465 HAA Bty left to help form a new 146th HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 788.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883/ ===Overseas=== 65th HAA Regiment left the UK in January 1942 as part of the reinforcements for the Far East following the Japanese invasion of Malaya.Woodburn Kirby, pp. 55‚Äì7, 105‚Äì9. It reached Ceylon in March, and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service raids against Colombo and Trincomalee began on 5 April (the Easter Sunday Raid) using Nakajima B5N 'Kate' bombers escorted by Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. Lacking effective radar cover the HAA gunners had difficulty engaging their targets against strong dazzle from the sun but claimed a number of 'kills'. The Japanese Naval aircraft raided again on 9 April, causing further damage. Over succeeding months the AA defences were improved, with GL Mk II radar, and the Japanese threat diminished.Routledge, pp. 237‚Äì8; Table XXXVIII, p. 253.Woodburn Kirby, pp. 119‚Äì27. By degrees, the AA defences of Ceylon were taken over by Indian Artillery units and the British regiments were released for service elsewhere. In March 1943, 65th HAA Rgt sailed with 181, 183 and 196 Btys to join Middle East Forces, and by May it was with 8 AA Bde at Tahag in Egypt. This formation was not yet operational but was training for the Allied invasion of Italy.Joslen, p. 484‚Äì5.Routledge, p. 160; Table XXV, p. 164. In the event, 8 AA Bde did not move to Italy until December 1943, and 65th HAA Rgt did not go with it.Routledge, p. 279; Table XLVII, p. 296. It returned to Home Forces in August 1944 and remained in the UK for the remainder of the war. The regiment with 181, 183 and 196 HAA Btys was placed in suspended animation on 15 June 1946. ==Postwar== AA Command formation sign worn 1944‚Äì55. When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed as 465 (Manchester) HAA Regiment RA, with its HQ still at Stretford Road, Hulme. It formed part of 70 AA Bde (the former 44 AA Bde based at Salford).Frederick, p. 1016.Litchfield, Appendix 5.444‚Äì473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. On 10 March 1955, AA Command was abolished, and there were wholesale disbandments and amalgamations among its units. 465 HAA Regiment was merged with 310 (8th Bn Lancashire Fusiliers), 360, 574 (7th Bn Lancashire Fusiliers), and 606 (East Lancashire) HAA Rgts to form 314 Heavy AA Regiment, RA, with RHQ at Hulme, and P (Manchester) Battery formed from 465 and 606 HAA Rgts.Litchfield, pp. 116‚Äì8.289‚Äì322 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. In May 1961, 314 HAA Rgt was broken up, with RHQ and P Bty amalgamated into 252 (The Manchester Artillery) Field Regiment, RA, whose present-day descendants are part of 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Regiment, RA.235‚Äì265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. ==Insignia== During World War II, the 65th HAA Regiment wore a printed arm badge consisting of a yellow letter 'M' on a green square. ==Battle Honours== The battalion was awarded the battle honour South Africa 1900‚Äì1902 for the service of its volunteers during the 2nd Boer War. During World War I the battalion contributed to the honours of the Manchester Regiment.'Battle Honours' at Museum of the Manchester Regiment. The Royal Artillery does not carry Battle Honours, so none were awarded to 65th HAA Regiment. ==Honorary Colonels== The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Arthur Egerton, 3rd Earl of Wilton (former CO) appointed 14 October 1863 * Capt (Hon Col) B.C.P. Heywood, TD, appointed 21 January 1914 * Gen Hon Sir Herbert Lawrence, appointed 6 January 1917. * Gen Sir Reginald Wingate, Bt, was appointed Hon Col of the 7th Manchesters on 16 December 1914; after the merger of the battalions he and Lawrence served as joint Hon Colonels of the 6th/7th Bn and later of the 65th HAA Regiment. * Col (Hon Brig) Alan Harvey Jones, CBE, TD, appointed 5 August 1952 (until 1961) ==Memorials== A memorial plaque to the men of 2nd VB Manchester regiment who served in the Second Boer War is now in the Manchester & Salford University OTC Hall at University Barracks in Boundary Lane. It lists 157 names, of whom six died on service. On 12 June 1921 a memorial was unveiled at the Stretford Road drill hall comprising dark oak panels bearing the names of 1057 officers and men of the 6th Manchesters who died during World War I. When the drill hall was demolished and replaced by the new University Barracks in 1995 the panels were re-installed in the new building.IWM War Memorial Register Ref 3285. A brass plate bearing the names of the members of 1/6th Bn who died in Egypt and Gallipoli was installed in the Chapel of Mustapha Barracks, Alexandria. When British troops left in 1946 the memorial was sent to England and is now also located at University Barracks. There is an elaborate marble memorial plaque in Eye Parish Church in Leominster to the three sons of Lord and Lady Cawley who were killed in World War I, including Capt H.T. Cawley, MP, of 1/6th Manchesters.IWM War Memorials Register Ref 33163.

The film jointly produced by Silicon Media and BlueOcean Pictures depicts the experience of a film crew which gets stranded in a remote Himalayan village. ==Plot== The crew led by a hit Bollywood filmmaker arrives there to shoot a song and dance sequence for their upcoming blockbuster. Soon they find themselves cut off from the outside world after torrential downpours and landslides. They are trapped with no basic amenities or means of communication and are totally at the mercy of the forces of nature. The team, having been accustomed only to the breakneck pace and luxury of urban life, struggles to cope with the total isolation and the rough conditions. They are forced to interface closely with nature and the local folk and experience life at a much gentler pace. They also get exposed to the challenges faced by the local people.

He was a four-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight rowing crew. He was a member of the AIF #1 eight which won at the 1919 Henley Peace Regatta and brought the King's Cup to Australia. ==Pre-war rowing== Both pre and post-war, Scott was employed as a fireman with the South Australian Railways. Scott's senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. He, along with the rest of the champion Murray Bridge senior men's eight, was selected in South Australian state eights to contest the Australian men's interstate eights title at the Interstate Regattas of 1913 and 1914. They won the national title in 1913 and placed second in 1914. Scott standing 2nd from right with the AIF #1 VIII at 1919 Henley Peace Regatta ==War service== Scott enlisted in the AIF aged 28 in August 1915. He joined the 27th Bttn. in their 8th reinforcement and embarked from Adelaide on HMAT A30 Borda in January 1916. On the Western Front he served initially as a Gunner with the 10th Field Artillery. AV Scott at the AIF project He was wounded in action at Pozieres during the height of fighting on 24 July 1916 and evacuated to hospital at Etaples. He had been promoted to Lance Corporal and then acting Sergeant before being demoted to Corporal in 1917. Patterson, Scott (2019) The Oarsmen, Hardie Grant Books In September 1917 he was transferred to the 11th Field Artillery. At Agincourt in May 1918 he refused an order to go up the line, was court-martialled, demoted to Gunner and sentenced to a year in military prison. At war's end Scott rowed at the 1919 Peace Regatta at Henley-on-Thames in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) crew which won the King's Cup which in time, became the trophy for the men's eight event contested annually at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Scott was seated in the AIF#2 crew for most of the training period leading up to the July 1919 Peace Regatta. Along with Tom McGill and George Nettam he was one of the final three crew changes made to the AIF #1 eight just ten days before the event. Later that month he again raced in the Australian AIF eight when they competed at the Inter-Allied Regatta on the Seine in Paris. Scott returned to Australia in October 1919 and just three days after disembarkation in Melbourne he raced in and won a Senior Fours event (the Steward's Challenge Cup) at the Henley on Yarra regatta in Melbourne on 25 October 1919. ==Post- war rowing== Scott returned to competitive rowing at Murray Bridge. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight continued as the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the Interstate eights title (by now known as the King's Cup) at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Scott rowed in the four seat of each of those crews and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923,. The South Australian media pushed for Scott's victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Scott and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed \\"the Murray Cods\\". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour some of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924. In the Olympic regatta, with Scott solid in the four seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Arthur Scott continued on as a first-class oarsman after the Olympics. He rowed at four in the South Australian representative eights in the King's Cup campaigns of 1925 (fourth) and 1926 (second). All told, Scott rowed in nine South Australian King's Cup eights in spite of war interrupting racing for five years in the middle of his career. He maintained an active involvement in rowing right through to his fifties. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Australian male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Australia Category:Rowers at the 1924 Summer Olympics Category:Australian Army soldiers Category:Australian military personnel of World War I ","title":"Arthur Scott (rower)"},{"id":"56623246","text":"Clube DataRo de Ciclismo was a Brazilian UCI Continental cycling team that existed from 2000 to 2010 as an amateur team and Continental from 2011 until 2014.

It reflects the ability of artery-occluding thrombi to let fluid seep into and through them. The more pervious a thrombus, the more fluid it lets through. Thrombus perviousness can be measured using radiological imaging routinely performed in the clinical management of acute ischemic stroke: CT scans without intravenous contrast (also called non- contrast CT, in short NCCT) combined with CT scans after intravenously administered contrast fluid (CT-angiography, in short CTA). Pervious thrombi may let more blood pass through to the ischemic brain tissue, and/or have a larger contact surface and histopathology more sensitive for thrombolytic medication. Thus, patients with pervious thrombi may have less brain tissue damage by stroke.Santos EMM, Marquering, HA, den Blanken MD, et al. Thrombus permeability is associated with improved functional outcome and recanalization in patients with ischemic stroke. Stroke 2016.Mishra SM, Dykeman J, Sajobi TT, et al.

Stroke 2016.Liebeskind DS, Agbayani E, Woolf GW, et al. Imaging of clot porosity prior to endovascular thrombectomy. Cerebral Large Artery Disease Posters, poster presentation at International Stroke Conference 2017. The value of thrombus perviousness in acute ischemic stroke treatment is currently being researched. == Origin of the term == Emilie Santos et al. introduced the term thrombus perviousness in 2016 to estimate thrombus permeability in ischemic stroke patients. Before, Mishra et al. used ‚Äòresidual flow within the clot‚Äô, and Fr√∂lich et al. used ‚Äòantegrade flow across incomplete vessel occlusions‚Äô to describe an estimate of thrombus permeability. Permeability is the physical measure of the ability of a material to transmit fluids over time. To measure thrombus permeability, one needs to measure contrast flow through a clot over time and the pressure drop caused by the occlusion, which is commonly not possible in the acute management of a patient with acute ischemic stroke. Current standard diagnostic protocol for acute ischemic stroke only requires single-phase imaging, visualizing the thrombus at a snapshot in time. Therefore, thrombus perviousness was introduced as a derivative measure of permeability. == Measurement == The amount of contrast that seeps into a thrombus can be quantified by the density difference of thrombi between non- contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and CT angiography (CTA) images. Two measures for thrombus perviousness have been introduced: (1) the void fraction and (2) thrombus attenuation increase (TAI). === Void fraction (Œµ) === The void fraction represents the ratio of the void volume within a thrombus, filled with a volume of blood (Vblood) and the volume of thrombus material (Vthrombus):\\\\text{Œµ}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{V}_\\\\text{blood}}{\\\\text{V}_\\\\text{thrombus}}Void fraction can be estimated by measuring the attenuation increase (Œî) between NCCT and CTA in the thrombus (Œîthrombus) and in the contralateral artery, filling with contrast on CTA (Œîblood), and subsequently compute the ratio of these Œîs:\\\\text{Œµ}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{œÅ}_\\\\text{CTA}\\\\,^\\\\text{thrombus}-\\\\text{œÅ}_\\\\text{NCCT}\\\\,^\\\\text{thrombus}}{\\\\text{œÅ}_\\\\text{CTA}\\\\,^\\\\text{blood}-\\\\text{œÅ}_\\\\text{NCCT}\\\\,^\\\\text{blood}}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Œî}_\\\\text{thrombus}}{\\\\text{Œî}_\\\\text{blood}} === Thrombus attenuation increase === To measure TAI, the mean attenuation (density, in Hounsfield Units) of a clot is measured on NCCT (œÅthrombusNCCT) and subtracted from the thrombus density measured on CTA (œÅthrombusCTA). CTA thrombus density increases after administration of the high-density contrast fluid used in CTA: Œîthrombus = œÅthrombusCTA ‚Äì œÅthrombusNCCT A manual (volume of interest [ROI]-based) and semi-automated (full thrombus segmentation) method have been described to measure thrombus density. ==== Manual 3-ROI TAI assessment ==== In the manual thrombus perviousness assessment, spherical ROIs with a diameter of 2 mm are manually placed in the thrombus, both on NCCT and CTA. To improve reflection of possible thrombus heterogeneity, three ROIs are placed per imaging modality rather than one.Santos EMM, Yoo AJ, Beenen LF, Berkhemer OA, den Blanken MD, Wismans C, et al. Observer variability of absolute and relative thrombus density measurements in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Neuroradiology 2015. The average of every three ROIs is calculated and used as œÅthrombusNCCT and œÅthrombusCTA. ==== Semi-automated full thrombus segmentation ==== In automated measurements, the thrombus on CTA images is semi-automatically segmented in three steps.Santos EMM, Marquering HA, Berkhemer OA, van Zwam WH, van der Lugt A, Majoie CB, et al. Development and validation of intracranial thrombus segmentation on ct angiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke. PLoS One 2014. # An observer places four seed points. The first two are placed in the vasculature ipsilateral to (on the same side as) the occlusion, one proximal and one distal to the clot. The second two are placed in the contralateral vasculature (on the opposite side), both at approximately the same height as the first two points. The automated method subsequently segments the contralateral vasculature using these seed points. # The segmentation of the contralateral side is mapped to the occluded artery, using mirror symmetry, to segment the occluded artery. # The thrombus is segmented using intensity based region growing. # Finally, the density distribution of the entire thrombus in NCCT is compared to that in CTA to calculate thrombus attenuation increase (Œî). ==== Comparison between 3-ROI and semi-automated full thrombus measurement ==== It has been shown that manual measurement tends to overestimate actual entire thrombus density, especially in low-density thrombi. Measurements based on the full thrombus show a wider variety of thrombus densities and better discrimination of high- and low- density thrombi and shows a stronger correlation with outcome measures than measurements based on 3 ROIs.Santos EMM, Niessen W, Yoo A, et al. Automated entire thrombus density measurements for robust and comprehensive thrombus characterization in patients with acute ischemic stroke. PLoS One 2016. == Influence of imaging parameters == TAI measurements performed on CT scans with thicker slices will be less accurate, because volume averaging results in a reduction of thrombus density on NCCT.Tolhuisen ML, Enthoven J, Santos EMM, et al. The effect of non-contrast CT slice thickness on thrombus density and perviousness assessment. CMMI/RAMBO/SWITCH, oral presentation at MICCAI 2017. Therefore, it has been suggested to only use thin-slice CT images (‚â§2.5 mm) to measure thrombus perviousness. == Additional permeability measures == Alternative measures of similar thrombus permeability characteristics have been introduced and are still being introduced. Mishra et al. introduced the residual flow grade, which distinguishes no contrast penetration (grade 0); contrast permeating diffusely through thrombus (grade 1); and tiny hairline lumen or streak of well-defined contrast within the thrombus extending either through its entire length or part of the thrombus (grade 2). == Clinical relevance == Currently, treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to an occlusion of one of the arteries of the proximal anterior intracranial circulation consists of intravenous thrombolysis followed by endovascular thrombectomy for patients that arrive at the hospital within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. Patients that arrive later than 4.5 hours after onset, or have contra-indications for intravenous thrombolysis can still be eligible for endovascular thrombectomy only. Even with treatment, not all patients recover after their stroke; many are left with permanent brain damage. Increased thrombus perviousness may decrease brain damage during stroke by allowing more blood to reach the ischemic tissue. Furthermore, level of perviousness may reflect histopathological composition of clots or size of contact surface for thrombolytic medication, thereby influencing effectiveness of thrombolysis.Bembenek JP, Niewada M, Siudut J, et al. Fibrin clot characteristics in acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with thrombolysis: the impact on clinical outcome.

During the war she participated in offensive operations in Ukraine, Moldova, and Poland for which she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 March 1945. == Early life == Shkarletova was born on 3 February 1925 in Kislovka to a Ukrainian peasant family. After graduating from secondary school she worked in the railroad industry and later on a collective farm until the start of the Second World War, after which she worked in the construction of defensive fortifications until German forces occupied her village in July 1942. Because German troops surrounded the city before she and the rest of her family were evacuated, she was not able to join the Red Army until Soviet troops retook control of the city in July 1943. == Military career == After the Red Army retook Kupiansk Raion in 1943 Shkarletova joined the army and was sent to brief medical courses in Millerovo. After graduating those courses in October she was deployed in the 170th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 57th Guards Rifle Division. Despite being a medic she participated in direct combat, and on several occasions led her unit in fighting on the Eastern Front. The regiment fought in multiple battles for control of strategic riverbanks on the Dnieper, Ingulets, Dniester, Southern Bug, and Vistula; in the Vistula operation near Warsaw she participated an advance to establish a bridgehead on the right bank under heavy enemy fire. As the only medic of the landing group, she had to run under heavy artillery fire and shelling attacks to provide first aid and carry the wounded to the safety of the forest. She evacuated over 100 wounded under the cover of darkness across the Vistula River for which she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in March 1945. == Later life == Shkarletova became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1946 and graduated from the Kupiansk Medical School in 1949.

Its depth range is and it occurs on sandy stretches of seabed and in seagrass meadows among the Neptune grass. ==Ecology== Like other hermit crabs, P. eremita inhabits the empty shell of a gastropod mollusc. It is often associated with the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica, epizoanthids, hydroids or the sponge Suberites domuncula which attach themselves to the shell. The main predators on this crab are loggerhead turtles, larger crustaceans, octopuses and certain fish. Like other crabs, P. eremita is a detritivore. Breeding takes place all year round. The larvae are planktonic and pass through two zoea larval stages and one megalopa stage before undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile hermit crabs. ==References== Category:Hermit crabs Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Crustaceans described in 1767 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Paguristes eremita"},{"id":"56623481","text":"Kim Min-sun (born 16 June 1999) is a South Korean speed skater.

Tchernavin. ==Background== Tatiana Vasilievna Sapozhnikova was born on December 20, 1887, in the Russian Empire. She studied at St. Petersburg University. Tchernavin worked as a curator in the Section of Applied Arts of the Hermitage. ===Gulag=== Following several arrests of her husband, Tchernavin herself was arrested in January 1931. On 25 April 1931 her husband was convicted for \\"wrecking\\" under Article 58, Paragraph 7 of the Soviet Penal Code and sentenced to five years in Gulag labor camps. They first met again in November 1931, when they began planning to escape from the Soviet Union. In August 1932 they met again and set out on their escape. After 22 days of trekking through rugged terrain and suffering hardships due to a lack of provisions and poor weather, they were finally able to reach Finland. (Tchernavin's son gave an account of the escape, filmed on location in the Russian Arctic, in Angus MacQueen's documentary Gulag (2000). ) ===Life after=== Tchernavin began to write her account of their escape during a period she spent in hospital recovering from the adverse effects of the journey on a heart condition. The book was published first in London in October 1933. The Tchernavins were still living in Finland in 1933, but in April of that year a letter from her husband, entitled \\"Methods of the OGPU\\", was published in The Times. The letter was a rebuttal from his personal experience of the statement by Andrey Vyshinsky at the then current trial in Moscow of Metropolitan- Vickers engineers that '...in U.S.S.R. the accused are not put to torture...'. A subsequent letter from Sir Bernard Pares strongly suggests that Pares had helped to bring about their publication. In March 1934 Pares presided at Tatiana's public lecture in London, entitled \\"The fate of the intellectual worker in Soviet Russia\\". In 1934, the family moved to England. Tchernavin became a translator in the UK Ministry of Information for the remainder of World War II and helped subtitle No√´l Coward's war propaganda film In Which We Serve. Andrei became a civil engineer and designed the Bow Flyover. ==Personal life and death== Tchernavin married Vladimir V. Tchernavin (1887‚Äì1949), who graduated from the same university. They had one child, Andrei Vladimirovich Tchernavin (1918‚Äì2007). Tchernavin died age 83 on March 1, 1971, in England. Tchernavin, her husband, and son are all interred at the St. Mary Churchyard in South Perrott, West Dorset District, Dorset, England. ==Legacy== Tchernavin's Escape From The Soviets (1934) and her husband's book I Speak for the Silent: Prisoners of the Soviets (1935) were among the first to give testimony of life under the Soviets, the GPU's operations and the Gulag. ==Works== * Escape From the Soviets (1934) ==See also== * Vladimir V.

It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. ==Taxonomy== This species was first described by the English zoologist Thomas Bell, writing in the publication A history of British Crustacea IV. Although the year is usually given as 1846, the part of this publication concerned was actually published in the last week of 1845. The type locality was Falmouth in England. Later in 1846, the French zoologist Hippolyte Lucas described Pagurus sculptimanus from Oran, and this was later determined to be a synonym of P. forbesii. ==Description== The genus Pagurus consist of around 170 species including 13 found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Of these 13, Pagurus forbesii and Pagurus cuanensis are distinctive in having long eyestalks, and the males have characteristic pleopods numbered 2 to 5 on the left. The carapace can grow to a length of about . The right chela (claw) is hairy and somewhat granulated; the propodus (penultimate segment) has a depression on either side of a long ridge that extends onto the dactylus. The visible portions of this hermit crab are reddish yellow, with darker spotting being present on the abdomen. ==Distribution and habitat== Pagurus forbesii occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, its depth range being . It inhabits sandy seabeds with coarse and medium-sized grains, as well as coral rubble. ==Ecology== Like other hermit crabs, P. forbesii uses the empty shells of gastropod molluscs to live in. This crab has been found inhabiting shells of the cornet (Cerithium vulgatum), the thick-lipped dogwhelk (Tritia incrassata), the common tower shell (Turritella communis) and Ocinebrina aciculata. The sea anemone Adamsia palliata often lives on the shell occupied by a hermit crab; usually this is a shell used by Pagurus prideaux, but in the Bay of Naples in Italy, about 8% of the shells occupied by P. forbesii were found to be colonised by the sea anemone. Three species of hermit crab were found to be present in a bay near Cadiz in southern Spain. Paguristes eremita were the biggest and positively selected the largest and most robust available gastropod shells. Diogenes pugilator and P. forbesii occupied similar-size, lighter shells, but despite being much more abundant, D. pugilator tended not to inhabit the commonest shell Turritella turbona, while P. forbesii seemed to preferentially select them. On occasions, D. pugilator continued to inhabit a shell whose aperture it had outgrown, while P. forbesii and P. eremita moved on to larger shells as they grew. ==References== Category:Hermit crabs Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fauna of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Crustaceans described in 1845 Category:Taxa named by Thomas Bell (zoologist) ","title":"Pagurus forbesii"},{"id":"56623767","text":"The 1960‚Äì61 season was the 72nd season of competitive football played by Ipswich Town.

It is now in the Palais des beaux-arts de Lille. It shows the eponymous scene from the Gospel of John, set in a Renaissance-style garden with geometric parterres, a fountain, a covered passageway and a cloister. Wearing a sumptuous gold and silver damask robe, Mary kneels before Christ, holding her left hand to her breast and her right on an alabaster vase. He leans on a hoe and points to the sky, whilst a white bindweed around the trunk of the tree behind him symbolises the fall of sin. Notice du tableau sur le site musenor A woman's shadow stretches along the passageway, possibly symbolising Mary Magdalene spreading the news of the Resurrection to the Twelve Apostles. ==History== It was produced during Sustris' first or second stay in Augsburg, probably for count Fugger of Kirschberg and Weissenhorn, whose coat of arms are in the bottom left of the work. Around the time of his stay there the artist assimilated the Italian style and combined the Venetian style with the mannerism of Francesco Salviati and Parmigianino. This and other works of that period by him show the influence of Titian, with whom Sustris had collaborated since 1540, and anticipated Paolo Veronese's 1560s compositions. It was then acquired by a rich banker and collector, Everhard Jabach, who sold it to Louis XIV in 1671.Catalogue entry - Palais des beaux-arts de Lille. Louis put it in the Salon des Bassans at the ch√¢teau de Versailles, near the entrance to his bedroom. Dominique Garrigues, Jardins et jardiniers de Versailles au grand si√®cle, Editions Champ Vallon, 2001, chapitre 7, p. 213 After the Chaptal Decree of 1801 the French state assigned the painting (then attributed to Dosso Dossi) to the museum in Lille. It was re-attributed to Sustris between 1801 and 1835. == References == Category:1540s paintings category:1550s paintings Category:Paintings of the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille Sustris ","title":"Noli me tangere (Sustris)"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},P={class:"card-container"};function I(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",P,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(F,[["render",I]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/47.md","filePath":"drive/47.md"}'),H={name:"drive/47.md"},E=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[C(L)]))}});export{G as __pageData,E as default};
