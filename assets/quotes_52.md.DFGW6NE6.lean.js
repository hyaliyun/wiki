Background Quite unusual, even for the late 1970s, the lyrics deal openly with the perspective of a gay man: In a 1978 interview with Rolling Stone magazine to mark the release of Some Girls, Jagger responded to questions regarding the song's lyrics: \\"...There is one song that's a straight gay song‚Äî\\"When the Whip Comes Down\\"‚Äîbut I have no idea why I wrote it. It's strange - the Rolling Stones have always attracted a lot of men... I don't know why I wrote it. Maybe I came out of the closet {laughs}. It's about an imaginary person who comes from L.A. to New York City and becomes a garbage collector... I sure hope the radio stations will play [it].\\" The lyrics could be taken to imply that the singer becomes a male prostitute, \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" was recorded at the Path√© Marconi Studios in Paris, France, between the months of October and December 1977. It was another of the famed Some Girls songs to feature just the core members of the Rolling Stones at the time. Jagger performed vocals plus guitar alongside Richards and Ronnie Wood. Wood would also contribute pedal steel guitar to the number, an instrument that also appears on the Some Girls songs \\"Shattered\\" and \\"Far Away Eyes\\". Bill Wyman performs bass while Charlie Watts plays the song's distinctive, driving beat. There are versions of both the base instrumental track and the fully developed backing track with additional lyrics, that run over ten minutes, widely available on bootlegs. \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" is seen by some Rolling Stones fans as the closest the Stones came to outright punk music on the album that many call the Stones' \\"punk album\\". It is also one of a few songs on the album to carry a heavy New York City influence. A majority of the Rolling Stones were living in New York at the time. A recording from a live show at the Detroit Masonic Temple, on 6 July 1978, was released on the 1981 compilation album Sucking in the Seventies, which covered much of their later 1970s material. It also acted as album mate \\"Respectable\\"'s B-side. A live recording from their 2002‚Äì2003 Licks Tour was captured and released on the 2004 live album Live Licks. When the Whip Comes Down is also the name of a 16-track Nine Inch Nails bootleg album taken from their performance at the Woodstock '94 music festival.

He was the founder of Black Swan Records, the first record label owned by an African American with wide distribution capabilities. The first was Broome Special Phonograph Records, founded in Massachusetts in 1919 and closed in 1923. Biography Harry Pace was born in Covington, Georgia. His father, Charles Pace, died when he was a baby so Harry was raised by his mother, Nancy Francis Pace. He finished elementary school at the age of twelve, and seven years later graduated valedictorian of his class in Atlanta University. Pace worked in printing, banking and insurance industries in Atlanta, Georgia, and Memphis, Tennessee. After receiving another degree in 1903, Pace went into the printing business with W. E. B. Du Bois in Memphis. Two years later they put together the short-lived magazine The Moon Illustrated Weekly. In 1912, Pace met and collaborated with W. C. Handy, who took a liking to him; they wrote songs together. In Memphis Pace also met, and married, Ethylene Bibb. Pace and Handy founded the Pace and Handy Music Company, which brought Pace to New York City. Around 1920, the company began working with composers William Grant Still and Fletcher Henderson. Although the company did well, Pace did not like Handy‚Äôs business methods and resigned. In 1921 Pace formed the Pace Phonographic Corporation, which issued records on the Black Swan label. The label was named for singer Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, who was called \\"the Black Swan\\". They had offices in the Gaiety Theatre office building in Times Square.Ken Bloom, Broadway: An Encyclopedia, Routledge; 2nd edition (November 11, 2003). For his record company, Pace brought in Henderson as recording manager and Still as arranger. His first releases featured performances of light classical music, blues, spirituals, and instrumental solos. Black Swan‚Äôs first hit was a recording of \\"Down Home Blues\\" and \\"Oh, Daddy\\", sung by Ethel Waters. Although Pace recorded many outstanding artists, the business failed, and Pace was forced to declare bankruptcy in December 1923. A few months later he sold Black Swan to Paramount Records. In 1925, Pace founded the Northeastern Life Insurance Company in Newark, New Jersey, which became the largest African- American-owned business in the North during the 1930s. Pace then moved to Chicago to attend the Chicago-Kent College of Law; he received his degree in 1933. He opened a law firm in downtown Chicago in 1942. Pace died on July 19, 1943, in Chicago, and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.findagrave.com Legacy * Pace is featured on the documentary series Profiles of African-American Success.

The west butte is located within the Pawnee National Grassland, while the east butte is on private land in Weld County. Rising approximately above the surrounding plains, the buttes are erosional remnants left standing in isolation as the surrounding High Plains surface has gradually worn away. The lower portions of the buttes are composed of relatively soft, clay-rich sedimentary rock called the Brule formation. The Brule formation is protected by an overlying layer of sandstone and conglomerate sediments called the Arikaree formation, which are more resistant to weathering.Gregory, L. 1996. Colorado Scenic Guide, Northern region, 3rd edition. Boulder: Johnson Books, 208 pp. Geology The buttes are in the northeastern edge of the Colorado Piedmont. To the north, the piedmont is bordered by the Chalk Bluffs, an escarpment on the edge of the High Plains. As the rains and snows slowly erode the bluffs, the piedmont grows towards the north. Stream capture expands the piedmont rapidly towards the upslope or westward. The Buttes themselves are remnants of the High Plains surrounded by the piedmont. Another remnant of the high plains is to the west where the Chalk Bluffs form the eastern edge.An Interpretive Resource Analysis of Pawnee Buttes, Colorado; Dissertation; Robert Jack Badaracco; Colorado State University; Fort Collins, Colorado; March 1971 The Buttes are a consolidation of several geological ages. The main mass of the butte is the lower half to two-thirds. It is a buff-colored layer from the Brule member of the White River Formation. It is from the Oligocene Epoch (25-40 mya). Below this level and visible only further east than the buttes is the Chadron member of the White River Formation. Above the Brule layer is the Pawnee Creek Formation from the Upper Miocene (20 mya). The cap of the buttes is the Arikaree Formation, also of the Miocene age. Research in the 1970s suggest that the upper level of the cap rock is of the Ogallala Formation from the Pliocene. The Pliocene layers exist further to the north in the High Plains region. The cap rock is a harder mixture of sandstone and conglomerate, while the Brule layers are a softer clay. The surrounding area is considered a badlands as North Pawnee Creek cuts numerous channels into the Brule Formation soils. Vegetative zones *‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôShort Grass‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô prairies surround the buttes. They are dominated by Blue grama and buffalo grass. Associated plants include the Thread-leaf sedge, ring muhly, western wheatgrass, and the prickly pear cactus. *‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôMixed Prairie‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô are the lighter and more sandy soils, on the heights. The dominant plants are the Needle and thread grass, western wheatgrass, Junegrass, along with short grass plants. There is a wider mix of vegetation which becomes more noticeable in spring and early summer when Broom snakeweed, fringed sage, plus various forbs, including milkvetches, and locoweeds are highly visible. The mixed prairie has the greatest variety of plants. *The ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôLittle Bluestem‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô is found across the entire grasslands, but it dominates in localized plots. These are in the swales and along north- facing slopes where the shade will retain water longer. Around the west butte, pockets are along the north and northeast facing slopes where the shade will retain water longer. These will also be Little Bluestem and a mix of Canada rye, Phlox, borges, and a mix of grasses and forbs. *‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôClay Barrens‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô surround the buttes, where the Brule Formation is exposed. Here taproots dominate with hooker sandwort, tufted milk vetch, and common commandra. Several of these species use rhizomes to root spread following small fractures in the clays. Other plants associated with the Clay barrens are; Phlox, Indian rice grass, Penstemon, and evening primrose. Where there is active erosion, there are no plants.

Renee Hobbs suggests that ‚Äúfew people verify the information they find online ‚Äï both adults and children tend to uncritically trust information they find, from whatever source.‚Äù People need to gauge the credibility of information and can do so by answering three questions: # Who is the author? # What is the purpose of this message? # How was this message constructed? Prior to the 1990s, the primary focus of information literacy was research skills. Media literacy, a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media. Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The term \\"information and media literacy\\" is used by UNESCO to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies (ICT) in the United States. http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/ICTREPORT.pdf Educators such as Gregory Ulmer have also defined the field as electracy. IML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.  Information and Media Literacy In the Digital Age  The modern digital age has led to the proliferation of information spread across the Internet. Individuals must be able to recognize whether information is true or false and better yet know how to locate, evaluate, use, and communicate information in various formats; this is called information literacy. 21st-century students The IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate. According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), \\"technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate.\\"Literacy by Design: Why is all This Technology so Important? He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that \\"if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context\\".Wilhelm, 2000, p. 4 Wilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada on 5000 Grade 4 ‚Äì 11 students. The key findings of the survey were: *62% of Grade 4 students prefer the Internet. *38% of Grade 4 students prefer the library. *91% of Grade 11 students prefer the Internet. *9% of Grade 11 students prefer the library.YCWW II, 2005a, para. 28 Marc Prensky (2001) uses the term \\"digital native\\" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world.http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection. By the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer.YCWW II, 2005b, p. 6 The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.YCWW II, 2005b, p. 8 In general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box. Students are accessing information by using MSN, personal Web pages, Weblogs and social networking sites.  Teaching and learning in the 21st century  Many teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning. We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives. Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information. Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as \\"digital immigrants.\\" They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR. Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work. Learning a language is best done early in a child's development. In acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group. Although more recent research suggests this impact still exists up to 10 years of age. Kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a \\"digital\\"-rich childhood. Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. \\"Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power.\\" Speaking \\"digital\\" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities. Students' struggle Many students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom. Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information. Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate. Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms. Performance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available. Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established. Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary. When the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved.Lambert, 1998, p. 6 Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology. The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met. After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked: * What does each student need to learn? * How does one know whether students have met the capacities? * How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning? Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support. Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves. In the curriculum This integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools. In addition, recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the National Educational Technology Standards. UK In the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field. US IML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education. Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District, have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators. Canada In British Columbia, Canada, the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996) as a stand-alone course. It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated. This integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools. In addition, recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML. The BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005.Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005) These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same. Arab World In the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed \\"New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy\\". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. Following up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. In recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. Prior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF. Asia In Singapore and Hong Kong, information literacy or information technology was listed as a formal curriculum. Barriers One barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems. While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate. Marc PrenskyMarc Prensky 2006, para. 25 identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: \\"Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling.\\" The mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives. Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe. Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science. Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology. Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs. One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools. Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions. Many barriers to IML exist. Notes References *August, Diane. (2006).

She is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) and the author of ten novels, including Dreams of the Compass Rose, a \\"collage\\" novel structured as a series of related and interlinked stories similar in arabesque flavor to The One Thousand and One Nights, Lords of Rainbow, a standalone epic fantasy about a world without color, the Cobweb Bride trilogy, and The Atlantis Grail books. Crowdfunding controversy In 2014 controversy erupted when she started an Indiegogo campaign to try to raise money for her authors; although the campaign was canceled after three days. As a result of \\"personal misfortunes\\", she had stopped paying royalties to the authors publishing books with Norilana Books, and hoped to raise enough money to pay what she owed them through the crowdfunding campaign. This generated discussion and criticism questioning to which extent small businesses should use Indiegogo or other similar crowdfunding sites to pay off business debt, and also resulted in criticism against her handling of the matter. A similar fundraiser was carried out successfully in 2008 for the same reasons, which resulted in donations of $19,000 to cover the debt she owed her authors, as well as to support herself.

Such events are typically held either to protest the suffering of some marginalized group of people, or in memory of the dead. In the latter case, the event is often called a candlelight memorial. A large candlelight vigil will usually have invited speakers with a public address system and may be covered by local or national media. Speakers give their speech at the beginning of the vigil to explain why they are holding a vigil and what it represents. Vigils may also have a religious or spiritual purpose. On Christmas Eve many churches hold a candlelight vigil. Candlelight vigils are seen as a nonviolent way to raise awareness of a cause and to motivate change, as well as uniting and supporting those attending the vigil.  South Korea's candlelight vigils  Candlelight vigil held in Masan in 2017 calling for the resignation of President Park Geun-hye In South Korea, the Candlelight vigils., also referred to as the Candlelight Struggle, Candlelight Revolution, or Candlelight protests is a symbolic collective gathering of political dissent in South Korea to combat injustice peacefully. This method of protesting began in 2002 as a result of the Yangju highway incident, was utilized in the rallies against the impeachment of Roh Moo-hyun in 2004, re- used again in the 2008 U.S. beef protests, and emerged in the 2016-18 President Park Geun-hye protests.  2002   Background  US AVLB vehicle that is similar to the one that struck and killed the girls On June 13, 2002, two fourteen-year-old Korean middle-school girls, Shim Mi-sun (Korean: Ïã¨ÎØ∏ÏÑ†) and Shin Hyo-seon (Korean: Ïã†Ìö®Ïàú), were struck and killed by a U.S. military vehicle in Yangju, Gyeonggi province on Highway 56, just 300 meters away from a friend's birthday party. The Korean government did not have any jurisdiction over the trial due to the U.S. military having their legal rights presided over by the Status of Forces Agreement, which doesn't hold them accountable to the Korean court. This resulted in public outrage once the U.S. court-martials determined that the G.I. soldier, Sergeant Mark Walker, and the vehicle's commander, Sergeant Fernando Nino, were not guilty of \\"negligent homicide\\" of the 60-ton U.S. tracked bridge carrier that killed the girls during their training exercise.  Demonstrations  On November 20, 2002, the U.S. military court made its first verdict of not guilty for the soldiers involved in the incident, triggering the re-emergence of the girls' crushed bodies being spread online after initially taking them down to respect their deaths. News of this incident and the trial's outcome was circulated through a TV documentary, which amassed an online community that viewed this incident as a \\"National Tragedy\\", resulting in nationwide candlelight vigils being held at the suggestion of a netizen in an internet cafe to collectively mourn the death of the girls. On November 30, about 30,000 Koreans gathered in Gwanghwamun for the first mass candlelight vigil to commemorate the girls and protest their injustice death as people sang the national anthem and voiced their demands. The mishandling of this case by the U.S. and the Korean government mobilized the vigils to gain momentum as they began to be held every weekend from November 2002 up until late January 2003. Following the protests, on November 27 President Bush issued a statement of apology through an American ambassador, but it was met with discontent from netizens as they sought for a direct apology from Bush and for the soldiers involved in the incident to be held accountable for their crimes. Following these events, the protesters had three demands they attempted to achieve, which outlined the following: (1) that the jurisdiction of the case be handed over to the South Korean court, (2) That an amendment should be made onto The Status of Forces Agreement to eliminate the autonomy U.S. servicemen have in evading the South Korean government and punishment, and (3) that President Bush, issue a statement of apology for death of the middle school girls. The vigils that continued to take place were labeled by some Korean media sources as \\"anti- Americanist\\" while others viewed it as a platform for self-expression for the younger generation. On December 7, the netizens who were participating in one of the 43 city-wide candlelight protests in Gwanghwamun broke through the police blockade and made their way to the U.S. embassy where they persistently tried to persuade them to apologize and seek appropriate justice. The last mass vigil took place on December 14, with about 100,000 people from over 60 cities and 15 countries gathering at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. Revisions were made to The Status of Forces Agreement as a result of these demonstrations. Since the incident, candlelight vigils have become a staple protest culture in South Korea.  2004   Background  Roh and Bush meet in October 2003 On a national televised news conference in 2004, President Roh displayed no remorse over his brother's bribe scandal and instead, blamed the construction company executive involved for exploiting a \\"lesser educated man\\". The following day, Roh also expressed his support for the Uri party and refused to publicly apologize, defiantly going against the parliament's demand for one, which caused the last traces of parliament support for Roh to cease. On March 12, members of the conservative oppositional party impeached Roh on the grounds of him violating \\"political neutrality\\" when he asked the nation to support the newly established Uri party for the April 15 elections. The National Assembly stripped Roh from his role as the head of state and chief commander soon after the voting session had ended, with Prime Minister Goh Kun stepping up as the interim President of South Korea. Despite Prime Minister Goh's assurance to the public that he would maintain Roh's policies with North Korea and the United States as well as protect South Korea's economy from going into chaos, Roh's supporters met the news of impeachment with hostility, rage, and as an embarrassment to their country due to Roh being the first democratically elected leader to be impeached.  Demonstrations  Roh's presidential win in 2003 was attributed to his self-made image and need for justice, especially following the events of the army vehicle that killed the two girls and the acquittals given to the perpetrators, which to many Koreans highlighted the unequal footing their country had with America. On March 7, 2004, 170 of Roh's supporters rallied against the impeachment motion by holding a candlelight vigil on the streets of Seoul 5 days before the National Assembly would vote on it. There were also various protests held in Seoul, Busan, Daegu, and Kwangju in response to the impeachment proceedings as the movement gained momentum through the internet. About 12,000 of Roh's supporters held a candlelight protest outside of the capital's National Assembly shouting \\"Impeachment is null and void‚Äù on the day the impeachment was announced. The amount of supporters who protested against the impeachment motion reached 70,000 the following day. Weekly rallies were held in March across the country, with March 20th having the highest turnout numbers of about 200,000 supporters, according to the rally organizers. The backlash that the conservative party received for impeaching Roh was felt through the high voter turnout for the April 15th election, that resulted in the Uri party winning 152 seats, gaining the majority in the National Assembly. The demonstrations and support from the people led to Roh's impeachment to be retracted on May 14, on orders of the constitutional court.  2008  Main articles: United States beef imports in South Korea and 2008 US beef protest in South Korea  Background  On April 18, 2008, the ban that the Korean government had implemented on the importation of U.S. beef due to a case of mad-cow disease in 2003 was lifted in an agreement directed by South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak and U.S. President Bush. This move caused a public outroar in response to a TV Program broadcast on MBC regarding food safety and the unknown risks of American beef. The broadcast also honed in on the unequal terms of the agreement that did not have any precautions set in the event that a BSE outbreak would be detected in the United States. In addition, the media portrayed this agreement as the South Korean government succumbing to the trade pressure of the United States.  Demonstrations  A candlelight vigil being held in Busan against the importation of U.S. beef On May 2, 2008, the streets of Seoul were filled with hundreds of secondary and college students that orchestrated a candlelight vigil via text messages and the internet in protest of the agreement. Thereafter, the candlelight protests became a daily occurrence, with 100,000 people gathering to rally against the agreement and calling for the impeachment of President Lee, which had garnered 1.2 million signatures online on May 6. On May 22, the Korean government announced that they would attempt to exclude certain parts of U.S. beef that may be more receptive to mad cow disease as the President offered an apology for disregarding the public's health concerns, but this did not quell their grievances. Protests erupted in Busan, Chuncheon, Daegu, and Gwangju, with the end of May ushering 211 arrests on protestors for displaying political slogans and signs that the Korean government had warned against utilizing. During the third week of June, President Lee's cabinet stepped down from their position due to the enormous amount of pressure they received from the protestors. On June 25, another agreement was discussed wherein President Lee lifted the ban on U.S. beef from cattle that were less than 30 months old. In response, a protest was organized by the People's Association Against Mad Cow Disease, leading to 91 arrests. Other protesters attempted to make their way to the president's office but were detained by police. On June 30, a wave of a new march was headed by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) with hundreds of its members coming out to protest. The candlelight protests lasted from May 2008 until August 2008 and is remembered as a mass movement that emerged from the South Korean government's failure to hold the trust of the people.  2016-17   Background  Main articles: 2016 South Korean political scandal and Park Geun-Hye KOCIS Korea President Park Sejong Econ 03 (11640577615) In October 2016, President Park Geun-hye was revealed to be involved in a corruption scandal that focused on the nature of her friendship with Choi Soon-il, the daughter of cult leader Choi Tae-min. JTBC were the first to report on the case, revealing that Choi had access and exerted influence over Park's state affairs, including classified information that should not have been leaked to an individual with no government rank or status. On October 25, Park released a statement of apology for giving Choi access to her drafted speeches during the early months of her presidency. A week later, Choi was arrested for the suspicion of employing improper influence on state affairs. Later on, the investigation revealed that Park and Choi accepted and demanded bribes from South Korean conglomerates, which were then funneled to Choi's family and to her non-profit organizations.  Demonstrations  Main articles: Impeachment of Park Geun-hye and 2016‚Äì17 South Korean protests Candlelight Protest around Sejong Center at Gwanghwamun The candlelight protests initially started in October 2016 and lasted until March 2017. The first candlelight vigil was held on October 29, shortly after the corruption scandal was disseminated through the media. The protests that were held came to be known as the Candlelight Revolution and amassed over 2 million protestors in Gwanghwamun Square in early December. The Candlelight Revolution pressured the National Assembly into processing the impeachment of Park, with the Constitutional Court approving the motion on March 11, 2017 as the rallies continued throughout the months with fervor. On February 13, 2018, Choi was sentenced to 20 years in prison for corruption and on April 6 of the same year, Park was found guilty of corruption, coercion, abuse of power, and leaking classified information, which amounted to her final sentence being a total of 24 years in prison.

In 2006, he was the runner-up in series 5 of Operaci√≥n Triunfo, a singing competition reality television program in Spain. In 2007, he released his solo album, Siempre Sale El Sol and the single \\"No Quiero Enamorarme\\".  Biography  Born in Zaragoza on November 13, 1980, he started to show his interest in music as a child. Son of a commercial agent and a cook, he studied music theory and piano. He loves running but, above all, singing. Before entering Operaci√≥n Triunfo in 2006, he worked as a waiter in the weekends at a theater in Zaragoza, but has always wished to devote himself to music. One of his idols is Mariah Carey.  Operaci√≥n Triunfo  In 2006, Zueras auditioned for Operaci√≥n Triunfo in Barcelona, where he passed all the tests until he was admitted as one of the 20 finalists who would perform on Gala 0 of the show with presenter Jes√∫s V√°zquez. From the very beginning Zueras stood out among his mates at the Academy for his sweet voice, singing Pop music and Ballads, with numbers like \\"Otra Vez\\", by Coti and Paulina Rubio, \\"Unchained Melody\\", by The Righteous Brothers, \\"Last Christmas\\" by George Michael, \\"Blue Velvet‚Äù by Bobby Vinton or \\"Me & Mrs. Jones\\" by Billy Paul, among others.

The first album single, ‚ÄúNo Quiero Enamorarme‚Äù (I don‚Äôt want to fall in love), had been released a week earlier (April 16). The song's video has had so far a large impact among the public, because of its depiction of Zueras participating in a threesome with a woman and another man. Zueras has stated that his primary intention with the video was to break away from the clich√© of innocent boy with which he was labeled at the Academy. In YouTube, the video has had more than 668,398 views in the 10 months following its release, and has received many supporting comments. The single made #5 in the charts the first week in Spain. During the first 6 months following the release, Zueras has sold 25,000 copies of his album \\"Siempre Sale El Sol\\" (The Sun Always Comes Out), which made # 31 in the Spanish charts.

Nature of test The test consisted of a multiple-choice questionnaire in which the examinee was asked to identify the meaning of 100 words as they were then used in black ghettos. Examples of words used included alley apple, black draught, blood, boogie jugie, and boot. The original sample used in the experiment consisted of 100 white and 100 black St. Louis high school students, aged 16‚Äì18 years old ‚Äì half of them being from low socioeconomic levels and the other half from middle income levels. Williams also had data from two other samples of blacks and whites. These samples included 25 black and 13 white college students from Mississippi and 19 white graduate students from Boston University. Out of the 200 students who participated in the original sample the 100 black students answered 87/100 answers correctly and the whites answered 51/100 questions correctly. In the other samples the results were similar with the black students' scores being drastically different from those of the whites.Matarazzo, J. D., & Wiens, A. N. (1977). Black intelligence test of cultural homogeneity and wechsler adult intelligence scale scores of black and white police applicants. Journal of Applied Psychology, 62(1), 57-63. Interpretation The results of the test showed that the black group performed much better than the white group. White students performed more poorly on this test than blacks, suggesting that there are important dissimilarities in the cultural backgrounds of blacks and whites. The results of these tests and examination of the BITCH-100 confirmed Robert Williams' belief that his intelligence test dealt with content material that was familiar to blacks. However, there exists a restriction of range in the current form of the test thereby limiting its usefulness as an instrument used for selection.Racial Differences on a Black Intelligence Test Journal of Negro Education, 43, 4, 429-436, F 74 Some argue that these findings indicate that test bias plays a role in producing the gaps in IQ test scores.IQ Tests and the Black Culture McNiel, Nathaniel D. Both of these tests demonstrate how cultural content on intelligence tests may lead to culturally biased score results. Still, these criticisms of cultural content may not apply to \\"culture free\\" tests of intelligence. The BITCH-100 and the Chitling test both have explicit cultural assumptions, while normal standardized tests are only hypothesized to have implicit bias. The fact that a test can have bias does not necessarily prove that a specific test does have bias. However, even on cultural free tests, test bias may play a role since, due to their cultural backgrounds, some test takers do not have the familiarity with the language and culture of the psychological and educational tests that is implicitly assumed in the assessment procedure.Assessment in Multicultural Groups: The Role of Acculturation van de Vijver, Fons J.R.; Phalet, Karen from the Special Issue on Advances in Testing Methodology from an International Perspective Applied Psychology. 53(2):215-236, April 2004.

Cam., is an American composer, musician, Camaldolese monk and Catholic priest. He is noted for his musical work to support the practice of meditation. He is the author of two books. Life He was born in 1958 as Phillip Daniel Consiglio and grew up near Joliet, Illinois. He later spent many years living in Phoenix, Arizona, where he worked as a professional musician, performer (guitarist and vocalist), arranger and producer. Consiglio began his recording career in his early twenties, and has since gone on to record numerous collections of original music in a wide variety of styles. Though much of his early work was in Catholic liturgical music much of his latest work incorporates styles and sacred texts from a wide variety of cultures and spiritual traditions. In 1992 Consiglio was admitted as a candidate of the Camaldolese Hermitage of the Immaculate Heart (better known as New Camaldoli) in Big Sur, California. In 1998 he earned a Masters degree in theology from St. John Seminary in Camarillo, California and was ordained a Catholic priest in July of that year. He has spent a considerable amount of time studying both Eastern and Western spirituality, particularly under the influence of Bede Griffiths. After his monastic formation and ten years living at New Camaldoli Hermitage, he re-located near Santa Cruz, California, and lived ten years in a hermitage where he spent about half of his time on the road performing concerts, and teaching or leading retreats mainly on the topic of the Universal Call to Contemplation. He made regular trips to India and other Asian countries, \\"learning and teaching.\\" In the fall of 2012 he resumed living at New Camaldoli. In July 2013 Consiglio was elected the prior of the hermitage after the previous prior, Robert Hale, O.S.B. Cam., informed the community that he was stepping down.

There are 22 of these institutions in France. Each year, approximately 1,500 students get a 2nd cycle dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur from most prestigious French Grandes Ecoles (as Mines de Paris, Mines de Sainte-Etienne or Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Arts et M√©tiers).  History : Decomps Report  Whereas in 1980, France trained 12 000 engineers a year, a polemic began on the need or not for multiplying the number of qualified engineers by 2, 3 even 5. In parallel, thanks to a law of 1987, the way of the apprentissage (Co-Op) opens gradually with the higher formations, progressively various supervision ministries approved the publication of lists of titles. In 1989, Bernard Decomps, professor at the Higher Teacher training school of Cachan ENS Paris-Saclay, was at the head of a working group on the requirements as engineers and returned his conclusions: existence of many technicians which are looking for evolution of training level, requirements as operational engineers having a better approach for industrial realities and to invest itself in particular in small and mid-size companies, report the deficiency for qualified engineers to manage the economy development and to stimulate industrial changes. The need for field engineers, trained by continuous vocational training or in initial formation, in partnership with companies, is then clearly identified.  ITII today  The Instituts des techniques d'ing√©nieurs de l'industrie (Technical Institut of Engineers for Industry) (iTii) belong to Formation d'Ing√©nieurs en Partenariat Engineers Education in Partnership (FIP). It is an entity which federates professional and academic partners to set up education strongly embedded in the industrial reality for new engineer profiles. An iTii is an equal association between teaching partners and professional partners. Teaching partners are establishments entitled to deliver a Titre d'Ing√©nieur (Ecoles d'Ing√©nieurs, universities). Professional partners are companies (large or small) federated within professional branches. iTii were born with the NFI (or FIP) at the beginning of the 1990s, following the report of the tendency of the qualified engineers were deviating from the field of the production to the profit of management or administrative duties (see below). The idea to associate companies for the training of engineers thus answers the wish to form profiles of engineers more carried towards functions of production. The first iTii opened by the way of continuing education, the candidates were high-level technicians having at least five years of experience, that their company wished to promote with the statute of engineer. Since, courses by alternation developed and always with strong association with the professional partners during the education and the degree delivery. iTii degrees are delivered by establishments which were entitled by the Commission of the title of engineer (CTI). They are thus recognized by the State and companies as a diploma as engineer statute. In 2005 the 22 iTii in France represent 1.200 graduates per year and 12.000 engineers already graduate in the disciplines of mechanics, electrical and computing engineering, industrial engineering, materials engineering, telecommunications and information technologies, Civil engineering, heat transfer engineering...

The peak attendance was estimated at 50,000. History Unlike the free-form happening in upstate New York, the Denver festival had the full support and local resources of a major city, taking place in Denver Mile High Stadium. There were high expectations for the Festival; it was commonly called the \\"First Annual\\" Denver Pop Festival. The peak attendance was estimated at 50,000, though on Sunday when it was declared a free festival, that number may have been higher. Ticket prices were $6 per day, or $15 for all three days (Fri, Sat, Sun). Frank Zappa is credited by some with inventing the audience wave during his set. He assigned sections of the stadium (audience) to each make different odd sounds and gestures, including standing with arms raised. He then \\"played\\" a \\"tune\\" on his \\"crowd instrument\\".

It is a two-story enclosed mall with 960,000 ft¬≤ of space. The mall has 118 stores and 5 anchors. It is surrounded by 4,900 surface parking spaces in four different color-coded lots (Red, Blue, Yellow and Green). Its anchor stores are Curacao, a Dillard's clearance outlet, J. C. Penney, and Macy's. History Dayton- Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation) began planning the mall in 1973. That year and again in 1974, the Las Vegas City Commission voted against the mall as some members felt that the project should be moved to a better location. In early 1974, Dayton-Hudson won a district court order which required the city to grant a necessary zoning variance. The City Commission appealed the ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court. In 1975, the Supreme Court forced the City Commission to grant the variance. Groundbreaking took place in May 1976, and construction took more than two years, at a cost of $20 million. Ernest W. Hahn Inc. was the general contractor. More than 1,200 people worked on the mall during construction. The mall was designed by architectural firm Charles Kober & Associates, which chose desert colors and tones for the building. The mall opened in 1978, at a time when The Boulevard Mall was the city's only other major indoor mall. In September 1978, after the mall's opening, Dayton-Hudson announced that the mall would be sold as part of corporate downsizing. At the time of opening, the mall included 7,600 parking spaces and two anchor stores: Diamond's and The Broadway. Sears and JCPenney stores were scheduled to open in 1979, thus completing the mall. Approximately 3,000 people were expected to ultimately be employed at the mall. The mall's name is derived from the English word for Las Vegas: Meadows. Dillard's opened at the mall in 1984. In December 1993, the mall was temporarily evacuated after a teenage boy made bomb threats with what ultimately turned out to be a fake bomb. The mall received a renovation in 1995, which included the expansion of its Dillard's store. Later that year, the executive director of the Las Vegas Indian Center criticized the mall's carousel for featuring a carving of an American Indian head on the back of one of the ride's horses, calling it \\"culturally offensive\\". On March 1, 1996, a no-smoking policy was instituted inside the mall due to requests from customers. A partial renovation took place in 1997, and included a new overflow parking lot added near the mall's JCPenney store. At the time, the mall was composed of 123 stores, and included one restaurant and a 14-vendor food court. That year, the mall designated parking spaces near its entrances as \\"Stork Parking,\\" reserved for expectant mothers. General Growth Properties acquired the mall in May 1998. At that time, the mall contained . By May 1999, General Growth Properties had increased the mall's occupation to 95 percent. In June 2003, General Growth Properties began a multimillion-dollar renovation that would include brighter indoor lighting, tile flooring, a new color scheme, a new stone facade, exterior paint, and enhanced landscaping, as well as three new escalators and upgrades to the food court. The company felt that the mall, with its dated 24-year-old presentation, needed a contemporary look to compete. The mall remained open during renovations, with most of the work being done during night hours. With 99 percent of the renovations complete, the mall celebrated its grand reopening on November 21, 2003, with a ribbon- cutting ceremony that morning, followed by live jazz performances and a live children's show featuring Strawberry Shortcake. Several new stores had been added during the renovations, which included new bathrooms and a revamping of the food court. The mall contained at the time. In conjunction with Valley Hospital Medical Center and the Summerlin Hospital, the Meadows Mall added the Healthy Living Play Area in November 2004, as a way to educate children about healthy lifestyles. In December 2004, a man was arrested on eight counts of illegally accessing people's credit card accounts after falsely telling them that he was a millionaire family member of the non-existent Meadows family, whom he claimed were the owners of the mall. Tomfoolery, a 24-hour restaurant and bar with five slot machines, opened on the mall's second floor in April 2005. Tomfoolery was approved for 10 additional slot machines in August 2005, despite opposition from local families. On March 9, 2007, the mall remained open during a police and SWAT search for a suspect who fled into the mall after a traffic stop. In 2014, Dillard's closed the first floor of its store in the Meadows Mall, and converted its second floor into a clearance outlet for unsold merchandise from other Dillard's stores. In March 2015, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, \\"With regional shopping centers proliferating, the Meadows is becoming an odd mall out ‚Äî the shopping center without a distinct personality or demographic segment. As a result, retail experts say, the mall faces a crossroads at which it must soon chart a new direction.\\" In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Meadows, into Seritage Growth Properties.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/4000-meadow- ln/3312581/landing In September 2015, the mall was 97-percent occupied. That month, VegasInc reported that despite the 2003 renovation, \\"it looks like a typical mall from the '90s.\\" Curacao opened in Dillard's vacant first-floor space in October 2016, and attracted 40,000 customers on its opening day. In June 2018, the mall's Macy's store opened Macy's Backstage, an off-price store-within-a-store. In August 2018, Round One announced plans to open an arcade and entertainment center inside the mall. Seritage leased part of the Sears first floor to Round One for the new project. Part of the plans would include the demolition of the closed Sears Auto Center. After a year, Round One fast-tracked its plans to get the project opened. The entertainment center opened on November 2, 2019. It features food, bowling, billiard tables, karaoke rooms, and more than 250 arcade games, including some imported from Japan. That month, it was announced that Sears would be closing its Meadows Mall location as part of a plan to close 51 stores nationwide. The store closed on February 3, 2020. The mall is frequently used as an early voting site during elections.

The term is also used for the surrounding area of the city. Dating from 1527,Richards, J.M., The National Trust Book of Bridges, Jonathan Cape, 1984, the bridge crosses at what was once the City of Aberdeen's southern boundary. This was the site of a battle in 1639 between the Royalists under Viscount Aboyne and the Covenanters who were led by the Marquess of Montrose and Earl Marischal. This was the only substantial action of the First Bishops' War, and it took place after the peace treaty had already been signed. The Bridge of Dee is approximately 32 feet (10 m) above typical water height and consists of seven nearly semicircular ribbed arches, built using granite and Elgin sandstone. Today the bridge carries the main A92 road into Aberdeen from the south. It was designated a Category A listed structure in 1967, and was also listed as a Scheduled monument until being de- scheduled on 16 February 2009. History The bridge was built following a bequest of ¬£20,000 by Bishop William Elphinstone who died in 1514. The bridge was completed by Bishop Gavin Dunbar. It was nearly all rebuilt between 1718 and 1723, and in 1841 was widened from 14 to 26 feet (from four to eight metres) under the direction of Aberdeen City Architect John Smith. Smith also designed the Shakkin' Briggie, and worked on the Bridge of Don with Telford and Wellington Suspension Bridge with Captain Samuel Brown. The bridge is located near the northern terminus of the Causey Mounth, a medieval drovers' road connecting Stonehaven to Aberdeen. This ancient trackway specifically connected the Bridge of Dee via Bourtreebush, Muchalls Castle and Stonehaven to the south.C.Michael Hogan, Causey Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham, 3 November 2007 The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the first battle of the Civil War in 1639.Archibald Watt, Highways and Byways around Kincardineshire, Stonehaven Heritage Society (1985) The following contemporary verse was written about the battle: ::Muskies mother [a large cannon] has made a vow ::That she will take her venter [dare to go], ::And thunder throughe (the) brige of Dee ::Led by a Covenanter. ::The Covenanters that ye see ::Come marching alongest the grein [open grassy ground], ::Wer not for feare of God they say, ::They wold plounder Aberdeine.'Battle of the Bridge of Dee' in James Maidment, ed., A Book of Scottish Pasquils, 1568-1715 (Edinburgh, 1868), pp. 102-105 A chapel had been built right next to the bridge as a resting place for pilgrims travelling to and from Aberdeen. There appears to be no record showing when it was built but we know that an inventory was made by the Chaplin Sir William Ray. This may have been done prior to a legal battle. Gordon of Abergeldie petitioned Aberdeen town council on 27 February 1530 claiming that the chapel prevented him having easy access to his fishing rights in the river. Having lost the court case Gordon removed one of the buttresses to the bridge to make a footpath for his men to get to the river. Consequently, Aberdeen Town Council, the owners of the bridge, started legal action against him in Edinburgh High Court. The Bridge is now more commonly known as Garthdee Bridge.The word Garth is an ancient Norse word for a cloister. A chapel with a quadrangle. This may be the root of the area's name Garthdee ie the cloister chapel beside the Dee river. Until 1832, this was the only access to the city from the south. The bridge still features the original 16th-century piers, coats of arms and passing places.

Marten (born April 18, 1984 in Indianapolis, Indiana) is a former American football offensive tackle in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys, Oakland Raiders, Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins. He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football at Boston College. Early years Marten attended Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School, where he played football. He was a two-time All-state Class 3A and All-county. In 2001, he earned All-Midwest and North- South All-Star honors. He also practiced the discus throw and basketball, where he helped the school win the State Class 3A championship in 2000. He accepted a football scholarship from Boston College. As a redshirt freshman in 2003, he was the backup to left tackle Jeremy Trueblood and made his first start at right tackle against Colorado State University. In 2004, he was named the starter at left guard. As a junior, he allowed only 1.5 sacks and 3 quarterback pressures in 13 starts. In 2006, he was moved to left tackle after Trueblood graduated, earning second-team All-ACC honors, after allowing only 1.5 sacks and no quarterback pressures. He started his last 38 games (first 25 at guard and last 13 at tackle). Professional career Dallas Cowboys Marten was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (67th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft. He was moved to right tackle and was inactive for every game during his rookie season. The next year, he was tried at left guard, before being released at the start of the 2008 season. His problems were never helped by the fact that he followed a string of unsuccessful offensive lineman selections, made by the team in the first rounds of the draft: Al Johnson (2003), Jacob Rogers (2004), and Stephen Peterman (2004). Oakland Raiders On September 8, 2008, he was claimed by the Oakland Raiders. That season, he was active in one game as a reserve against the Buffalo Bills and would eventually be waived before the start of the 2009 season. Chicago Bears The Chicago Bears had previously tried to claim Marten, but were beaten by the Raiders due to waiver priority. On September 7, 2009, they were able to sign him to their practice squad, before promoting him to the active roster on December 14, although he would not appear in a game that season. He was waived before the start of the 2010 season and was signed to the team's practice squad, until being released on December 7. Miami Dolphins On December 9, 2010, he was signed to the Miami Dolphins' practice squad, reuniting with head coach Tony Sparano, who was his offensive line coach in Dallas. After the season, the Dolphins signed him to a two-year contract on January 3, but he retired from professional football on August 5, 2011.

Founded in 1973, it is an independent school, serving children in preschool through 8th grade. Its mission is to nurture and prepare children for life by integrating character education with a strong academic program. The school provides small classes, which are purposefully designed as ‚Äúblends,‚Äù or two-grade classrooms. This setup enables teachers to challenge students with academic material that is appropriate for their intellectual readiness, regardless of age or grade. A small school with six classrooms, fewer than 100 children attend Japhet School each year. Integrated with academics is Japhet School‚Äôs national award-winning character education curriculum, which aims to build a peaceful community within the school and give Japhet students a foundation of character. Japhet is a National School of Character, and was the first school in Michigan‚Äîand the first independent school in the country‚Äîto receive this award. Despite Japhet's small size, large neighboring school districts have engaged Japhet School educators to train their own teachers in Japhet's character education method. Japhet staff also travel out of state to conduct this training. History In 1973 a group of teachers and parents founded the school. Their rationale was that public schools were no longer being \\"moral educators\\".\\"School aims to make pupils Good Citizens.\\" Associated Press at The Argus-Press (Owosso, Michigan).

Each classroom has two grades within it, a purposeful design to enable academic individualization. Students in all grades know each other by name, and teachers and staff know each child in the school.http://japhetschool.org/faq.shtml Japhet School teachers teach children for two years in this small setting. This affords first-hand knowledge and awareness of each student‚Äôs accomplishments and potential, as well as insight into the learning styles of each child.  Tuition As of 2002 the average annual tuition was $6,900 ($ when adjusted for inflation).  Extra-curricular activities and special events  The school does not offer religious education.

Broad Run has its own ZIP Code of 20137, and its post office serves a population of 1,510. The town of Broad Run was a thriving community in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The decline of the railroads spelled the demise of the town, and all that is left of the town proper is less than five homes from that period, and a few stone foundations and chimneys for buildings that no longer exist. A ramp for loading freight trains still exists on the still active Norfolk Southern freight line, but is covered with weeds and in such disrepair as to be no longer useful. The most notable historical site in Broad Run is Chapman's Mill, Beverley's Mill, which can be found two-thirds of a mile ESE from the center of the town of Broad Run. The Battle of Thoroughfare Gap, a seemingly inconsequential but eventually very important battle of the American Civil War, was fought at Chapman's Mill. The Thoroughfare Gap Battlefield and Galemont are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Broad Run postal area is an almost exclusively residential area which is mostly in Fauquier County, Virginia, with the northeast section in Prince William County. The few businesses that can be found in the Broad Run postal area are generally home businesses or agricultural businesses.

Norfolk, Virginia's downtown waterfront shipping and port activities historically played host to numerous and often noxious port and shipping-related uses. With the advent of containerized shipping in the mid-19th century, the shipping uses located on Norfolk's downtown waterfront became obsolete as larger and more modern port facilities opened elsewhere in the region. The vacant piers and cargo warehouses eventually became a blight on downtown and Norfolk's fortunes as a whole. But in the second half of the century, Norfolk had a vibrant retail community in its suburbs; companies like Smith & Welton, High's, Colonial Stores, Goldman's Shoes, Lerner Shops, Hofheimer's, Giant Open Air, Dollar Tree and K & K Toys were regional leaders in their respective fields. Norfolk was also the birthplace of Econo-Travel, now Econo Lodge, one of the nation's first discount motel chains. Similarly, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. Granby Street traditionally played the role as the premiere shopping and gathering spot in the Hampton Roads region. Retailers ranged from low-priced variety stores such as Woolworth'sDowning, Sarah. \\"On This Day in Norfolk - Feb. 12, 1960, p. 29 - \\"Student sit-ins spread to Norfolk to include Woolworth's\\" and GrantsPhoto of NorVa Theater at Cinema Treasures, showing Lerners, Goldman's, Hofheimer's and Grants in vicinity on Granby St. retail corridor to more upscale department stores such as Smith & Welton (1898-1988), Rices Nachmans (1918-1985) and Ames and Brownley (1898-1973), and fine hotels and theaters lined its sidewalks. However, new suburban shopping developments promised more convenience and comfort. The opening of Pembroke Mall in Virginia Beach, the region's first climate controlled shopping mall, and JANAF Shopping Center in Norfolk's Military Circle area, helped foment Granby Street's spiral into commercial obsolescence. With amenities such as ample free parking at the door of one's favorite store, and in the case of Pembroke Mall, climate control, the businesses of downtown's Granby Street found it harder and harder to compete. Beginning in the 1920s, Norfolk's city leaders began what would be a long push to revive the fortunes of its urban core. Overview  Historic District  The Downtown Norfolk Historic District is a national historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 and expanded in 2001. It encompasses 97 contributing buildings in the central business district of Norfolk. The largely commercial buildings reflect Norfolk's prosperity of the 1890s through the 1930s. The district includes notable examples of the Classical Revival, Beaux Arts, and Italianate styles. Notable buildings include the Showcase Building (c. 1914), Seaboard Citizens' National Bank Building (c. 1935), Citizen's Bank (now Wheat) Building (1897-1899), Virginia Club (1903), Hotel Fairfax (1907), Colonial Theater (1907, now demolished),Colonial Theater at Cinema Treasures Lorraine (later the Hotel Thomas Nelson) (1905), Lynnhaven Hotel (1906), Royster Building (1912), Merchants and Mechanics Savings Bank (1913), Smith & Welton (1917), NorVa Theater (1922), Loew's State Theater (1926, now TCC Roper Center for Performing Arts),\\"About the TCC Roper Center for Performing Arts, tccropercenter.org\\"Roper Center for the Performing Arts\\" at Cinema Treasures, retrieved Aug. 21, 2018 Selden Arcade (1931), and the Navy YMCA (1906). Located in the district are the separately listed Walter E. Hoffman United States Courthouse (1932-1934), Owen B. Pickett United States Custom House (1852), Monticello Arcade (1907), Wells Theatre (1913), and Old Norfolk City Hall (1898-1900). and Accompanying photo and Accompanying map Granby Street White Tower restaurant on Granby St. during its blighted Granby Mall era, 1984; has been demolished and the area has been successfully revitalized. To compete with the suburban shopping destinations, Norfolk city leaders tried to create the same mall experience on Granby Street. The city rebranded its commercial core the \\"Granby Mall.\\" Granby Street was closed to auto through-traffic, repaved, landscaped and new street furniture and fixtures were installed. Granby Mall was a concept by city leaders with the best of intentions, but it actually ended up speeding the demise of Granby Street as a viable commercial destination. The closing of Granby Street to auto traffic actually made the district more inconvenient for potential customers and reduced the amount of pedestrian traffic that passed by the businesses. The reduced pedestrian and automobile traffic on the street created an atmosphere of abandonment and probably contributed to an increase in downtown crime, which further fueled customer fears of downtown, which in turn caused additional businesses to close, and on and on. This vicious cycle of abandonment and blight persisted for much of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Urban Renewal While Granby Street experienced its decline, Norfolk city leaders were also focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Federal urban renewal programs such as the Housing Act of 1949 promised cities around the country millions of dollars in government grants for the purpose of removing blight conditions and preparing urban land for redevelopment. Norfolk, as with many other cities, took full advantage of these Federal urban renewal funds and began large-scale demolitions of broad swaths of downtown. This included slum housing that, in the mid-20th century, did not have indoor plumbing or access to running water. However, Norfolk's urban renewal also included the demolition of many prominent city buildings, including the former City Market, Norfolk Terminal Station (the Union railroad station), The Monticello Hotel, and large swaths of urban fabric that, were they still in existence today, might be the source of additional historic urban character, including the East Main Street district (where the current civic complex is located). At the water's edge, nearly all of the obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive. In place of the piers and warehouses rose: the Waterside Festival Marketplace, an indoor mall created by the Rouse Company and similar to Baltimore's Inner Harbor Pavilions; the waterfront Town Point Park - an esplanade park with wide open riverfront views; and the Norfolk Omni Hotel. On the inland side of Waterside Drive, the demolition of the warehouses and wharves created new parcels on which most of the highrise buildings in Norfolk's skyline now stand. Nauticus  Waterfront  The Waterside In contrast to the failure of the Granby Mall initiative, the redevelopment of Norfolk's waterfront turned out to be an almost immediate success. Town Point Park created a pleasant and inviting new public space at which Norfolkers gather, whether for formally planned events like Harborfest, or for more passive enjoyment of the views, breeze, and people watching. The Waterside festival marketplace opened in June 1983, creating a new space for entertainment and shopping and serving as a catalyst for downtown renewal. (However, by 2012 the Waterside's popularity was in decline; as restaurants and shops had closed, leaving much of the building vacant. With sentiment growing among citizens and city officials that the structure may have outlived its usefulness, the city council was considering several plans for use of the space.) Nauticus, the National Maritime Center, was constructed on a former pier adjacent to Town Point Park. Adjacent to Nauticus, the Halfe Moone Cruise and Celebration Center, a cruise-ship terminal and event venue, opened in 2007. The is docked for permanent public exhibition. The clearance of the obsolete warehouses and wharves from the waterfront also created real estate development that has brought hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in office buildings. The transformation of downtown Norfolk's waterfront skyline is so dramatic that it is largely unrecognizable to anyone who may have left the city in the early 1980s. MacArthur Center Dillard's department store, MacArthur Center, 2009 In the mid 1990s, with the fortunes of the waterfront looking brighter and more solid, Norfolk leaders once again turned their attention back to the historic Granby Street core of downtown, which continued to lag behind the waterfront in terms of revitalization. After the failure of the Granby Mall project, city leaders were intent on finding some way to bring commercial activity back to downtown in a major way. The idea of creating an upscale regional mall on the cleared during urban renewal just one block east of Granby Street had remained in the minds of Norfolk's economic development officials for many years; at one point, vice mayor, and later judge, Joseph Jordan proposed an enormous, enclosed shopping center to be known as Norfolk Gardens, so elaborate as to include indoor amusement park rides, presaging the development years later of Bloomington, Minnesota's Mall of America. Norfolk had long courted upscale Seattle-based retailer Nordstrom to locate in Norfolk and economic development officials made numerous appeals to the luxury department store. In late 1997, Norfolk officials made the announcement that they had finally received a commitment from Nordstrom to open a store in a new downtown shopping mall. Norfolk officials named the mall, MacArthur Center, in honor of the five-star World War II General whose tomb is located across the street from the proposed site. In return for opening a store at the new mall, Norfolk officials allocated nearly $100 million in public funds to infrastructure improvements and construction of parking garages to support the shopping mall. Construction of MacArthur Center began in late 1996 and the mall opened in March 1999 to much acclaim. MacArthur Center opened as a three- story enclosed shopping mall with Dillard's and Nordstrom as the first two anchor department stores. Regal Cinemas operates an 18-screen stadium seating movie theater on most of the third floor of the mall. There is space for a future anchor store at the northwest end of the mall. MacArthur Center introduced upscale retailing to the Hampton Roads region and it featured the premier of a number of retailers that did not previously exist in Hampton Roads (White House Black Market, Pottery Barn, Z Gallerie, Nordstrom, Johnny Rockets, Chico's, Coach, among others). MacArthur Center's entry to the Hampton Roads market heightened the competition in the retail industry and prompted waves of upgrade and investment at numerous other shopping malls around the region, especially at MacArthur Center's main competitor, Lynnhaven Mall in Virginia Beach, which announced a strategy to renovate the mall and upgrade the tenant mix to reposition it as a worthy competitor to its new Norfolk neighbor. In a touch of irony, the primary element that nearly killed Granby Street as a commercial destination - the climate controlled shopping mall - is probably what saved Granby Street from wholesale abandonment and breathed into it new life. During the construction of MacArthur Center, Norfolk invested additional funds on infrastructure improvements throughout downtown. Sidewalks were rebuilt, additional lighting was added and streets were repaved throughout the area. A parking garage on Monticello Avenue north of MacArthur Center was partially demolished in order to reconnect the western and eastern segments of Freemason Street, which were previously blocked by the garage. With the promise of thousands of new shoppers coming to nearby MacArthur Center, owners of properties throughout downtown reinvested in their buildings and made them ready for new retail and residential uses. Tidewater Community College opened its Norfolk campus and central administrative offices on Granby Street, locating its library in the painstakingly renovated former Smith & Welton department store building. The formerly vacant storefronts on Granby Street have been repopulated by so many trendy restaurants and bars that the street, once a destination primarily for homeless and vagrant individuals, has become a new hub for the sophisticated segment of the Hampton Roads region's nightlife. The residential population of downtown continues to grow as unused commercial buildings are converted into lofts and condominiums and new residential developments rise on formerly vacant land. One such building, the Norfolk Rotunda Building , located on St. Paul's Blvd. and in front of MacArthur Center, opening in 2007. Formerly a bank, the building now holds 66 luxury condominiums, and stands seven stories tall, the top two stories being penthouse suites. Since MacArthur Center's opening, three new office towers have been completed: 150 West Main Street (located at Boush Street and Main Street, completed in 2002, 20 stories, tall), the Dominion Enterprises Building (150 Granby Street, completed in 2007, 20 stories, tall), and the Wells Fargo Center (440 Monticello Avenue, completed in 2010, 23 stories, tall) which contains an office tower, street level retail, and apartments. Ongoing revitalization benefits Norfolk's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim in economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country. Publications such as the American Planning Association's monthly Planning Magazine, have hailed the tremendous rebound in the downtown residential population, and Money magazine proclaimed Norfolk as the number one city in which to live in the South in 2005. The rising fortunes of the downtown area have helped expand the city's coffers which has in turn been able to direct its attention to revitalizing other neighborhoods of the city. Located just northwest of downtown, the Ghent district of Norfolk is one of the Hampton Roads region's premier urban residential communities. Ghent has the highest residential densities of any other area in Hampton Roads, and is home to a diverse array of people - artists, strivers, lower income to wealthy, etc. Many other areas of Norfolk are also being revitalized, including Fairmount Park Neighborhood, Ocean View and East Beach, the latter both on the Chesapeake Bay.

As a senior, he caught 55 passes for 903 yards and 11 touchdowns, while helping his team win back-to-back Class 3A Florida State championships in 2001 and 2002, with identical 14-1 records. He was named honorable-mention All-State, All-Space Coast and All-Conference. Robinson was a four-year member of the football, basketball and track teams. He received a scholarship to attend Illinois State University, after his stepfather contacted the Redbirds' coaching staff; as his brother had also been recruited there a year before. College career As a freshman at Division I-AA Illinois State University, he appeared in all 12 games with 6 starts, including the final 5 games. He ranked second on the team with 19 receptions for 260 yards (13.7-yard avg.) and 3 receiving touchdowns (tied the school freshman record). As a sophomore in 2004, he started in all 11 games, leading the team with 44 receptions for 564 yards (12.0-yard avg.) and 7 touchdowns. He had his first career 100-yard receiving game in the season opener against Saint Xavier University. As a junior in 2005, he was named the league's Offensive Player of the Year and a consensus All-American, after setting school single-season records with 86 receptions for 1,465 yards, a 17.0 yard average for 12 touchdowns (second in school history). He led the Division I-AA in receiving yards per game (133.18) and was second nationally with 7.82 receptions per game. He was also a finalist for the Walter Payton Award, given to the top offensive player in Division I-AA. As a senior in 2006, he started 9 games and missed 4 contests with an ankle injury. He ranked second on the team with 40 catches for 718 yards and 7 touchdowns. In the season opener against Kansas State University, he had 9 receptions for 77 yards and 2 touchdowns, before suffering an illegal block on a fourth quarter kickoff return, that sidelined him with an ankle sprain for 2 games. He recovered to catch 6 passes for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns against Murray State University. In the fifth game against Southern Illinois University, he re-injured his ankle and was forced to miss the next two contests. Robinson finished his college career with 37 starts out of 43 games, making 192 receptions (a school record) for 3,007 yards (a school record) and 29 receiving touchdowns. In 2009, he was voted to the Missouri Valley Football Conference quarter-century team. In 2015, he was inducted into the Illinois State Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career 2007 NFL Draft After running the 40-yard dash in 4.41 seconds at the NFL Combine, he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the third round (75th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft. Atlanta Falcons As a rookie, he played in 15 games (six starts) and recorded 37 receptions for 437 yards (11.8 avg.) and one touchdown. In 2008, rookie Harry Douglas and the return of Brian Finneran from a two-year absence, led to Robinson falling on the depth chart. That season, he played in only six games because of head and hamstring injuries, making 5 receptions for 52 yards. St. Louis Rams On April 7, 2009 the Falcons traded Robinson and its fifth round (160th overall) and sixth round (196th overall) draft choices to the St. Louis Rams, in exchange for their fifth round (138th overall) and sixth round (176th overall) selections. Robinson became a starter until he fractured his fibula on September 28, 2009 and was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season. At the time, he was leading the team in receptions with 13 for 167 yards. In 2010, he had another dismissive season, he appeared in 14 games (11 starts), finishing fifth on the team with 34 receptions for 344 yards and 2 touchdowns. He became an unrestricted free agent and wasn't re-signed after the season. San Diego Chargers On August 3, 2011, he signed as a free agent with the San Diego Chargers. He had a disappointing preseason in which he had only 1 catch for 18 yards through the first three preseason games. Despite an impressive final preseason game in which he caught six passes for 120 yards, he was released at the end of training camp on September 3, 2011. Dallas Cowboys On September 7, 2011, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys, who scouted him during the joint practices they had with the San Diego Chargers in training camp. He was released on September 13, after suffering a hamstring injury during his first practice. On September 20, he was re-signed to the roster as insurance to shore up an inexperienced wide receiver roster. Robinson would end up having a breakout season and quickly earning the third receiver job. On October 2, he caught seven passes for 116 yards in a loss to the Detroit Lions. During the week eight loss against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had five catches for 103 yards and a touchdown, his first as a Cowboy. In the next game on November 6, Robinson again caught five passes for 32 yards and a touchdown. Robinson followed up that game with three catches, two of which were touchdowns, against the Buffalo Bills starting in place of Miles Austin, while he was recovering from a hamstring injury. From week 8 through week 12, Laurent caught 24 passes for a total of 321 yards and 7 touchdowns. Robinson played a key role in the offense and registered career highs with 54 receptions for 858 receiving yards and a team leading 11 touchdowns. Having a one-year contract with the Cowboys, he became an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Jacksonville Jaguars On March 14, 2012, he signed a five-year, $32.5 million contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars, in which 14 million was guaranteed. Although he was expected to be the team's number one receiver, he failed to impress and missed 9 games, after suffering 4 concussions and being placed on the injured reserve list on November 21. The first concussion happened in training camp, when he landed on a small strip of concrete pavers near the practice field. Robinson was later seen as a health risk and was released on March 13, 2013.

The Board licenses associates under two categories: Certified Genealogist and Certified Genealogical Lecturer. Associates' licenses are granted for a five-year period, at which time they may be renewed upon application to the Board, and that application's evaluation in a peer-review process. Associates holding certification work in a variety of fields. They have been recognized as experts in matters of inheritance and probate; some work to assist in reuniting families separated through adoption. Others prepare applications for lineage societies; still others work to prove Native American genealogies. Board-certified associates also provide leadership in an effort to raise standards for research, writing and reporting in the genealogical field.

It was included in her revised edition of Henriette-Julie de Murat's last novel, Les Lutins du ch√¢teau de Kernosy (The Sprites of Kernosy Castle, 1710). Henriette- Julie de Castelnau de Murat, Le s√©jour des amans ou Les Lutins du ch√¢teau de Kernosy, 1773 Synopsis A king and queen had lost all their children except a daughter, whom they were in no hurry to marry off. The king of the ogres, Rhinoceros, heard of her and decided to marry her; when he threatened the kingdom with his ogres, the king decided he had no choice. When she was told of the ogre's threat, the princess agreed and set out with a companion, Corianda, with whom she was close. Corianda had tried to get the princess' fairy godmother to help, but she had refused because the king had not consulted her. Rhinoceros met them in his rhinoceros form. The princess fainted. Rhinoceros carried them both to his castle, and turned to his own form, which was as ugly. The princess' distress annoyed him, and he left to hunt bears. Corianda suggested that the princess hide in a bearskin, and sewed her into one, but that act turned her into a she-bear. They thought her fairy godmother was responsible. In that form, Corianda let her out to run away and told the ogre that he had eaten her in his rage. The ogre set out to search, but her fairy godmother had led her to a boat in which she escaped to another kingdom. The king of that kingdom found her (in her form as a she-bear) while hunting and her gentle behavior persuaded him to take her captive rather than kill her. She fell in love with him, but her ugliness made her despair. Her fairy godmother, in the form of a fish, bade her wait, and at midnight, turned her back into a princess. Then she warned her that she had to put back on the bearskin every morning, though she could take it off at night, which the princess obeyed. The king, meanwhile, had come to the conclusion that he had fallen in love with the bear, which shocked him. One day, he was in her presence when she turned back to a princess. Her fairy godmother told him to go and arrange a wedding. He did so. The bear came, and was turned into a princess before the court. They married and in two years had two young sons. The ogre heard of their wedding and set out with his seven-league boots. In the kingdom, he disguised himself and offered to give golden distaffs and silver spindles to the nurses and governesses of the young princes if he could spend a night in the babies' chamber. When they agreed, he cut the babies' throats with the queen's knife and went off to disguise himself as an astrologer. In that form, he assured the king that the murderer lived in the castle. The bloody knife was found and the queen condemned to death. The queen lamented her fate but was glad to die having lost her husband's love. The king was moved by this and could not bring himself to have her die, but was unable to speak loudly enough to stop the servants. Her fairy godmother appeared by the stake with the two princes and Corianda to reveal the ogre as the killer and restore the princes to their parents.Marina Warner, ed. Wonder Tales, p 99-122, Commentary The heroine of this story makes use of a fairy tale motif, the use of shapeshifting to escape.Catherine Orenstein, Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale, p 176, This is also found in Giambattista Basile's The She-Bear. The heroine's story of being found in the woods by the hero while living like a wild thing is common to many more tales, such as The Bear, Allerleirauh, The Princess That Wore A Rabbit-Skin Dress, and Mary's Child. The slandered mother also appears in many tales, such as Mary's Child, The Twelve Wild Ducks, The Lassie and Her Godmother, and The Six Swans. In The Girl Without Hands, the slanderer's motive is much as in this one: a (male) villain was angered by losing the heroine.

Formerly the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 2003 to 2007, he is the current Chair of the Government Caucus. He was a member of the Quebec Liberal Party. Education Valli√®res went to the Universit√© de Sherbrooke and obtained a bachelor's degree in pedagogy and would teach at several schools from 1970 to 1972 and from 1976 to 1981 while being a councilor at the Commission Scolaire de Taillon in 1972. He also obtained a certificate in psychology human relations. Professional and political career Valli√®res would become the MNA for Richmond in 1973 when Robert Bourassa won a second majority term. Vaillieres was however defeated by the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1976 when they gain power for the first time ever under the leadership of Ren√© L√©vesque. After returning to his teaching duties from 1976 to 1981, Valli√®res was a candidate again in Richmond for the 1981 elections and was re-elected. He was then named the President of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Parliamentary Commission. He was re-elected again in 1985 as the Liberals returned to power when Robert Bourassa returned to politics and became once again the party leader. Valli√®res would be named the Chief Whip of the government for the full mandate. During his next mandate from 1989 to 1994, he was the Minister responsible or the delegate minister for several portfolios. He was named the Delegate Minister of Transport in 1989 and Delegate Minister of Regional development, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1990 to 1992. He was also the Minister responsible of Fisheries from 1990 to 1994. When Daniel Johnson, Jr. replaced Bourassa during the final months of the Liberal Mandate, Vallieres was named once again the chief Whip of the government. While the Liberals lost power in 1994, Valli√®res was re-elected for a fifth mandate and was named the opposition's critic in agriculture and regional development and was for the second time the President of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Parliamentary Commission. In 1998, he was re- elected for a sixth mandate and was again the opposition critic in agriculture until 2000. He was also the President of the Territorial Planning Parliamentary Commission. When the Liberals regained power in 2003, Valli√®res, who won a seventh mandate was named for the third time the Chief Government Whip. After a Cabinet shuffle in 2005, he was named the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food until the 2007 elections. However, during his mandate, health issues forced him to take some time off and Laurent Lessard took over temporarily his duties. He was also briefly the Minister responsible of the Centre-du-Qu√©bec region after a minor Cabinet shuffle in 2006. Valli√®res won an eighth mandate but was removed from the Cabinet and named the Chair of the government Caucus.

It is, essentially, a program that allows the user to observe an operation through simulation without actually performing that operation. Simulation software is used widely to design equipment so that the final product will be as close to design specs as possible without expensive in process modification. Simulation software with real-time response is often used in gaming, but it also has important industrial applications. When the penalty for improper operation is costly, such as airplane pilots, nuclear power plant operators, or chemical plant operators, a mock up of the actual control panel is connected to a real-time simulation of the physical response, giving valuable training experience without fear of a disastrous outcome. Advanced computer programs can simulate power system behavior, weather conditions, electronic circuits, chemical reactions, mechatronics, heat pumps, feedback control systems, atomic reactions, even complex biological processes. In theory, any phenomena that can be reduced to mathematical data and equations can be simulated on a computer. Simulation can be difficult because most natural phenomena are subject to an almost infinite number of influences. One of the tricks to developing useful simulations is to determine which are the most important factors that affect the goals of the simulation. In addition to imitating processes to see how they behave under different conditions, simulations are also used to test new theories. After creating a theory of causal relationships, the theorist can codify the relationships in the form of a computer program. If the program then behaves in the same way as the real process, there is a good chance that the proposed relationships are correct. General simulation General simulation packages fall into two categories: discrete event and continuous simulation. Discrete event simulations are used to model statistical events such as customers arriving in queues at a bank. By properly correlating arrival probabilities with observed behavior, a model can determine optimal queue count to keep queue wait times at a specified level. Continuous simulators are used to model a wide variety of physical phenomena like ballistic trajectories, human respiration, electric motor response, radio frequency data communication, steam turbine power generation etc. Simulations are used in initial system design to optimize component selection and controller gains, as well as in Model Based Design systems to generate embedded control code. Real-time operation of continuous simulation is used for operator training and off-line controller tuning. There are four main renowned simulation approaches: Event- Scheduling method, Activity Scanning, Process- Interaction, and Three-Phase approach, in comparison, the following can be noted: The Event-Scheduling method is simpler and only has two phases so there is no Cs and Bs, this allow the program to run faster since there are no scanning for the conditional events. All these advantages also tells us something about the disadvantages of the method since there are only two phase then all events are mixed (no Bs and Cs) then the method is not parsimony, which means it is very hard to enhance (Pidd,1998). The Activity Scanning approach is also simpler than the Three-Phase method since it has no calendar, and it support the parsimonious modeling. However this approach is much slower than Three-Phase since it treats all activities are treated as conditional. On the other hand, the executive has two phases. Usually this approach is confused with the Three- Phase method (Pidd, 1998). The Process- Interaction ‚Äúshare two common advantages first; they avoid programs that are slow to run. Second, they avoid the need to think through all possible logical consequences of an event‚Äù (Pidd, 1998). Yet, as (Pidd, 1998) claims this approach suffers from DEADLOCK problem, but this approach is very attractive for novice modelers. Although, (Schriber et al, 2003). Says ‚Äúprocess interaction was understood only by an elite group of individuals and was beyond the reach of ordinary programmers‚Äù. In fact (Schriber et al, 2003).adds ‚Äú. Multi- threaded applications were talked about in computer science classes, but rarely used in the broader community‚Äù. Which indicates that the implementation of Process-Interaction was very difficult to implement. The obvious contradiction, in the previous quote is due to the mix up between the Process Interaction approach and the Transaction-flow approach. To see the complete idea of the origins of Transaction-Flow best stated by (Schriber et al, 2003): This was the primordial soup out of which the Gordon Simulator arose. Gordon‚Äôs transaction flow world-view was a cleverly disguised form of process interaction that put the process interaction approach within the grasp of ordinary users. . Gordon did one of the great packaging jobs of all time. He devised a set of building blocks that could be put together to build a flowchart that graphically depicted the operation of a system. Under this modeling paradigm, the flow of elements through a system was readily visible, because that was the focus of the whole approach. The Three-Phase approach allows to ‚Äúsimulate parallelism, whilst avoiding deadlock‚Äù (Pidd and Cassel, 1998). Yet, Three-Phase has to scan through the schedule for bound activities, and then scans through all conditional activities which slow it down. Yet many forgo the time spent in return for solving the deadlock problem. In fact, Three-Phase is used in distributed systems whether talking about operating systems, databases, etc, under different names among them Three-Phase commit see (Tanenbaum and Steen, 2002). Electronics Electronics simulation software utilizes mathematical models to replicate the behaviour of an actual electronic device or circuit. Essentially, it is a computer program that converts a computer into a fully functioning electronics laboratory. Electronics simulators integrate a schematic editor, SPICE simulator and onscreen waveforms and make ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios easy and instant. By simulating a circuit‚Äôs behaviour before actually building it greatly improves efficiency and provides insights into the behavior and stability of electronics circuit designs. Most simulators use a SPICE engine that simulates analog, digital and mixed circuits for exceptional power and accuracy. They also typically contain extensive model and device libraries. While these simulators typically have printed circuit board (PCB) export capabilities, they are not essential for design and testing of circuits, which is the primary application of electronic circuit simulation. While there are strictly analog Mengue and Vignat, Entry in the University of Marne, at Vallee electronics circuit simulators include both analog and event-driven digital simulationP. Fishwick, Entry in the University of Florida capabilities, and are known as mixed-mode simulators.J. Pedro and N. Carvalho, Entry in the Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal This means that any simulation may contain components that are analog, event driven (digital or sampled-data), or a combination of both. An entire mixed signal analysis can be driven from one integrated schematic. All the digital models in mixed-mode simulators provide accurate specification of propagation time and rise/fall time delays. The event driven algorithm provided by mixed-mode simulators is general purpose and supports non-digital types of data. For example, elements can use real or integer values to simulate DSP functions or sampled data filters. Because the event driven algorithm is faster than the standard SPICE matrix solution simulation time is greatly reduced for circuits that use event driven models in place of analog models.L. Walken and M. Bruckner, Event- Driven Multimodal Technology Mixed-mode simulation is handled on three levels; (a) with primitive digital elements that use timing models and the built-in 12 or 16 state digital logic simulator, (b) with subcircuit models that use the actual transistor topology of the integrated circuit, and finally, (c) with In-line Boolean logic expressions. Exact representations are used mainly in the analysis of transmission line and signal integrity problems where a close inspection of an IC‚Äôs I/O characteristics is needed. Boolean logic expressions are delay-less functions that are used to provide efficient logic signal processing in an analog environment. These two modeling techniques use SPICE to solve a problem while the third method, digital primitives, use mixed mode capability. Each of these methods has its merits and target applications. In fact, many simulations (particularly those which use A/D technology) call for the combination of all three approaches. No one approach alone is sufficient. Programmable logic controllers In order to properly understand the operation of a programmable logic controller (PLC), it is necessary to spend considerable time programming, testing, and debugging PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software is a valuable tool in the understanding and learning of PLCs and to keep this knowledge refreshed and up to date. PLC simulation provides users with the ability to write, edit and debug programs written using a tag-based format. Many of the most popular PLCs use tags, which are a powerful method of programming PLCs but also more complex. PLC simulation integrates tag-based ladder logic programs with 3D interactive animations to enhance the user‚Äôs learning experience.Article about PLCLogix These interactive animations include traffic lights, batch processing, and bottling lines.Article referencing 3DWorlds By using PLC simulation, PLC programmers have the freedom to try all the \\"what-if\\" scenarios changing ladder logic instructions and programs, then re-running the simulation to see how changes affect the PLC's operation and performance. This type of testing is often not feasible using hardwired operating PLCs that control processes often worth hundreds of thousands ‚Äì or millions of dollars.Advantages of PLC simulation Sheet metal forming Sheet metal forming simulation software utilizes mathematical models to replicate the behavior of an actual metal sheet manufacturing process. Essentially, it is a computer program that converts a computer into a fully functioning metal manufacturing prediction unit. Sheet metal forming simulation prevents metal factories from defects in their production lines and reduces testing and expensive mistakes improving efficiency in the metal forming process. Metal casting Metal casting simulation is currently performed by Finite Element Method simulation software designed as a defect- prediction tool for the foundry engineer, in order to correct and/or improve his/her casting process, even before prototype trials are produced. The idea is to use information to analyze and predict results in a simple and effective manner to simulate processes such as: *Gravity sand casting *Gravity die casting *Gravity tilt pouring *Low pressure die casting The software would normally have the following specifications: *Graphical interface and mesh tools *Mould filling solver *Solidification and cooling solver: Thermal and thermo-mechanical (Casting shrinkage).  Network protocols The interaction between the network entities is defined by various communication protocols. Network simulation software simulates behavior of networks on a protocol level. Network Protocol Simulation software can be used to develop test scenarios, understand the network behavior against certain protocol messages, compliance of new protocol stack implementation, Protocol Stack Testing. These simulators are based on telecommunications protocol architecture specifications developed by international standards body such as the ITU-T, IEEE, and so on. The output of protocol simulation software can be detailed packet traces, events logs etc. See also * List of computer simulation software * List of discrete event simulation software * Application Simulation Software * Electronic circuit simulation * Full system simulator * Instruction set simulator * Logic simulation * Microarchitecture Simulation * Network simulation * Process simulation78611220340 * Training Simulation * Business simulation * Virtual prototyping References Category:Electronic design automation Category:Simulation programming languages ","title":"Simulation software"},{"id":"10957946","text":"Catherine Dufour (born 1966) is a French science fiction and fantasy writer.

It is named for the American tennis player Arthur Ashe. Although it is a sport-oriented award, it is not limited to sports-related people or actions, as it is presented annually to individuals whose contributions \\"transcend sports\\". According to ESPN, the organization responsible for giving out the award, \\"recipients reflect the spirit of Arthur Ashe, possessing strength in the face of adversity, courage in the face of peril and the willingness to stand up for their beliefs no matter what the cost\\". The award has been presented as part of the ESPY Awards ceremony at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles since 2008. The inaugural award, made at the 1993 ESPY Awards, was presented to the American college basketball player, coach, and broadcaster Jim Valvano. In 1993, ESPN partnered with Valvano to create the V Foundation which presents the annual Jimmy V Award to \\"a deserving member of the sporting world who has overcome great obstacles through perseverance and determination.\\" Suffering from cancer, Valvano gave the inaugural Arthur Ashe Courage Award acceptance speech which \\"brought a howling, teary-eyed Madison Square Garden to its feet\\". Valvano died two months after receiving the award. Although the award is usually given to individuals, it has been presented to multiple recipients on seven occasions: former athletes on United Airlines Flight 93 (2002), Pat and Kevin Tillman (2003), Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah and Jim MacLaren (2005), Roia Ahmad and Shamila Kohestani (2006), Trevor Ringland and David Cullen (2007), and Tommie Smith, John Carlos (2008), and survivors of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal (2018). The accolade has been presented posthumously on five occasions. The award has not been without controversy: in June 2015, ESPN's announcement of Caitlyn Jenner as the recipient of that year's Arthur Ashe Courage Award led to significant criticism among online commenters and some members of the media, with Bob Costas calling the decision to give Jenner the award a \\"crass exploitation play\\". Many critics of the Jenner award considered Lauren Hill, who played college basketball despite suffering from a brain tumor that would claim her life only a few months later, a more worthy recipient. Others cited Noah Galloway, an Iraq War double amputee who competes in extreme sports and was also a finalist in the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars in 2015, as a worthy candidate. The 2018 recipients of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award were the survivors of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal.

It was recorded at El Ensayo Recording Studio by Emmanuel del Real (member of Caf√© Tacuba) and produced by del Real with the band. The songs on the album were composed by Austin TV in a small house in the middle of the woods in a place called Avandaro.http://www.elenanorabioso.com/2012/09/entrevistamos-a-austin-tv/ Like previous albums from Austin TV, all tracks are instrumental, only accompanied with spoken voices that are not related musically. This album could be catalogued under a concept album, including a more than 60 pages CD-sized book. This complement is a fictional diary of an old man called Mario Lupo Gonz√°lez F√°bila (Fontana Bella's alternate title is El Diario de Mario Lupo Gonz√°lez F√°bila), living alone in a forest called Fontana Bella (the album's main title). The diary shows a 5 months struggle with paranormal phenomena such as ghosts appearances, hallucinations and persecutory delusions (It may be depicted in real life as an alleged dementia or any incurable disease), including phlegmatic thoughts, anecdotes, attached letters and notes. The last days of the diary show distorted typography, scratches in some paragraphs, backwards chapters, cryptic letters and macabre imagery, resuming a progressive deterioration in Mario Lupo's world, or a complete insanity (even the last track called Vol√≥ Al Cielo (or Flew To The Sky) could confirm the death of the protagonist). The days appear at the top of the pages, starting from July 5 to November 2, probably making an allusion to the Day of the Dead (or D√≠a de Muertos), a very important date in Mexico, which is celebrated that last day.

Mebane with the Seahawks in 2015. Fellow Seahawks teammate Richard Sherman was quoted as saying of Mebane: \\"He's an incredibly technical player in his movements and everything he does. He's rarely out of position and he's rarely out of the play. You rarely see a defensive tackle running making tackles on the sideline, or [making] tackles on screen plays. He does all that. But once again, he's overlooked because I guess he's not a big sack-total guy. He's just a guy that does his job incredibly well week in and week out.\\" http://espn.go.com/blog/seattle- seahawks/post/_/id/9126/sherman-lobbies-for-wagner-and-mebane With the Seahawks Mebane anchored the middle of the defensive line for the all-time great Legion of Boom defense.

Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm was a farm owned and operated by agronomist Seager Wheeler (1868‚Äì1961) \\"Wheat King of the Prairies\\" or \\"The Wheat Wizard of Rosthern\\" who developed dry land farming techniques as well as fruit and wheat strains which could grow in a short prairie growing season followed by harsh winters. Seager came to Canada in 1885 and applied for his own homestead in 1890. His original homestead was located at NE Section 16 Township 38 Range 4 West of the 3rd Meridian, and he was aided by a loan from the Temperance Colonization Society Limited - Toronto Whereas the nearest present day town of Rosthern, Saskatchewan is located at Sec.35, Twp.42, R.3, W3. To get to the restored Seager Wheeler Maple Grove Farm travel 7 km east of Rosthern. Five separate entries of wheat which were grown at this farm location during 1911 to 1918 won World Wheat Championships. Morris Bodnar, Member of Parliament for Saskatoon‚ÄîDundurn, commemorated Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm as a National Historic Site of Canada on August 3, 1996 The site is honoured as the location where hardy wheat and fruit strains were developed which were well suited to the prairie climate and growing season. History Seager Wheeler Land Patent Form Seager Wheeler developed many dryland farming techniques, invented equipment as well as winning numerous awards for developing wheat strains and fruits which would grow in the short prairie season, seeds which would survive over winter and many other practises which helped develop a sustainable agricultural economy in Saskatchewan. Seager Wheeler's brother, Percy Wheeler, also homesteaded in the area successfully proving his land at SW section 2 Township 43 (A) Range 2 W of the 3rd Meridian in 1884. Seager and Percy jointly developed the three point seed cleaning system which present day farmers still use. The Seager Wheeler Historic Farm Society purchased the farm and opened it up in 1996. The farming techniques, implements, and pursuit of prairie wheats and fruits by Seager Wheeler, are presented on the restored homestead by the Seager Wheeler Historic Farm Society.

Delaplane, Virginia has a ZIP Code of 20144. History Located in the heart of Virginia's famous Piedmont Hunt Country, Delaplane was originally known as Piedmont Station, a small village formed around a stop on the Manassas Gap Railroad. In 1874 it was renamed in honor of W. E. Delaplane,Delaplane Historic District NRHP nomination form prepared by Maral Kalbian and Margaret Peters. July 30, 2003. Section 8, p.17.

In 1861 General Stonewall Jackson marched his troops from Winchester to the Piedmont Station train depot, where they loaded onto rail cars headed for the First Battle of Manassas. This marked the first time a railroad had been used to move troops into battle. Delaplane encompasses some of North America's oldest fox hunting territory, and from 1932 to 1945 Delaplane's Cobbler Mountain range hosted many of General George S. Patton's fabled escapades with his Cobbler Fox Hounds club. Patton was Master of fox hounds until his military transfer to Hawaii in 1935, and the club was disbanded ten years later upon receiving news of his untimely death in Heidelberg, Germany. Today Piedmont Fox Hounds based in The Plains, the oldest fox hunting club in the United States, still hunts Delaplane's rustic, stone wall lined terrain; as do Orange County Hunt based in Middleburg and Old Dominion Hounds. In 1975 local resident and philanthropist Paul Mellon donated a 1,132-acre tract of land in Delaplane to the Commonwealth of Virginia creating Sky Meadows State Park which hosts the Delaplane Strawberry Festival sponsored by historic Emmanuel Episcopal Church every Memorial Day. The tract's previous owner, the late Sir Robert Hadow, was a Consul General from Great Britain and originally named the parcel Skye Farm after the island in Scotland which the area reminded him of. In 1991 Paul Mellon presented an additional 462-acre adjoining tract as a gift to the park. This tract, renamed the Lost Mountain Bridle Trail Area, was originally surveyed by George Washington and purchased by Washington from his client Lord Fairfax. More recently, in his memoirs Virginia Senator John Warner fondly recalls childhood summers spent working at Hill Crest Farm in Delaplane, while on break from St. Albans School in nearby Washington, D.C.

Points of interest Today the village of Delaplane remains home to Emmanuel Episcopal Church, an antique shop, and a working post office. Nearby towns of Upperville, Middleburg, and Marshall also provide commercial services to Delaplane's widely spaced residents. Delaplane's proximity to Washington, D.C., as well as a remarkably well preserved 19th century agricultural heritage, gave rise to numerous and expansive country estates; many of which are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places such as Mount Bleak House, Moreland, Oak Hill, an early home of John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States,Journey through Hallowed Ground ‚Äì Oak Hill at nps.gov.

Along with Sky Meadows State Park, Delaplane is home to the G. Richard Thompson Wildlife Management Area, the Crooked Run Valley Rural Historic District, and Goose Creek, a designated Virginia State Scenic River. Delaplane Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in February 2004. The state-funded Virginia Outdoors Foundation along with private conservation groups such as the Piedmont Environmental Council have helped place the vast predominance of Delaplane's privately held land into perpetual conservation easement. These efforts, coupled with Delaplane's ensconcement within northern Fauquier County's most restrictive \\"RC\\" (Rural Conservation) zoning district, have imposed strict limits on development, and fostered the growth of local, family oriented farm-to-table efforts such as Hollin Farms and Valley View Farm that participate in the Piedmont Environmental Council's Buy Fresh Buy Local program.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed August 15, 2011 tributary of the Monongahela River in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. At its juncture with the Monongahela is Braddock, Pennsylvania, where the Battle of the Monongahela (\\"Braddock's Defeat\\") was fought in 1755. In the mid-19th century, the Pennsylvania Railroad laid tracks along the stream as part of its Main Line from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Course The headwaters of Turtle Creek are in Delmont. The stream flows westward through the municipalities of Export, Murrysville, Monroeville, Penn Township, Trafford, Pitcairn, Wilmerding, Turtle Creek, East Pittsburgh and North Braddock, before and entering the Monongahela River in North Versailles Township. History The western frontier: 1700s 1751 map depicting \\"Turtle C\\" near top, just left of center Turtle Creek is the English translation of the Native American name, naming the area for its abundance of turtles. In the mid-18th century the Turtle Creek valley lied on the western frontier of the British colony of Pennsylvania, and much of its early written history revolved around the French and Indian War. In 1755 the first major battle in the theater took place near the mouth of Turtle Creek at the Monongahela river, where the British General Edward Braddock was mortally wounded and his forces compelled to retreat from what became a failed expedition to capture the French Fort Duquesne. In 1758 General John Forbes lead a more formidable and ultimately successful expedition against the fort, establishing a more northerly military road which crossed Turtle Creek in what is now Murrysville. In 1763 the war with the French was concluded and Pontiac's War began, in which Henry Bouquet's forces engaged a group of allied tribal forces at the Battle of Bushy Run. Upon defeating his opponents, Bouquet followed them downstream to the banks of Turtle Creek near what would become the town of Pitacirn, where he found the Native American forces had hastily abandoned their camp site, which Boquet referred to as a \\"Dirty Camp\\". Bouquet's description inspired the name of small stream that flows into Turtle Creek there, \\"Dirty Camp Run\\". After these hostilities abated, George Washington, who was part of both Braddock's ill-fated expedition and Forbes' successful campaign, returned to the area and is believed to have followed roads along Brush Creek and Turtle Creek en route to and from Fort Pitt. Washington traveled through the area multiple times, and was known to have stopped at the residences of two early settlers of the Turtle Creek area. One was Martha Miers, a French and Indian war widow, who had an inn near Thompson Run. The other was John Fraser, who had served with Washington under General Braddock and who settled near the mouth of Turtle Creek. Railroads and industrialization: ~1850-1900s The Turtle Creek area in 1884. The Pennsylvania Railroad (red) and the coalfields (brown) are two of the features highlighted. These would have lasting impacts on the course of the creek and the quality of water flowing through it. A century after the first military roads were blazed through the Turtle Creek valley, another type of road would take advantage of the gentle gradient that the creek carved through the surrounding hills. In 1852, the Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad opened for business, transporting passengers and freight between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh via track laid along the left bank of the lower section of Turtle Creek and farther upstream through the Brush Creek valley. In 1891 the Turtle Creek Valley Railroad began service from Trafford along the middle and upper sections of Turtle Creek. It was acquired by the PRR in 1903, and the railroad would be further extended beyond the bounds of the Turtle Creek watershed to Saltsburg. Andrew Carnegie's Union Railroad was laid along Turtle Creek and its tributary, Thompson Run connecting to his Edgar Thomson Steel Works in Braddock. George Westinghouse's Interworks Railway began service in 1902, connecting his three major manufacturing facilities in the lower Turtle Creek valley. As industry grew in the Turtle Creek valley, several towns began to grow around the factories, railroads and resources along the creek. By 1876, the largest towns along Turtle Creek were the railroad towns of Port Perry, which no longer exists and Turtle Creek, which was incorporated in 1892. Pitcairn incorporated in 1894 and the borough of Wall incorporated on the opposite bank of the creek a decade later; both grew in response to the sprawling rail-yard between them. East Pittsburgh, Wilmerding and Trafford all populated with the workers of the Westinghouse factories. The town of Export was established near the headwaters of Turtle Creek as a mining community, which exported coal via the Turtle Creek Branch of the PRR to industrial areas downstream and elsewhere. The 21st century At the beginning of the 21st century, much of the infrastructure that changed the Turtle Creek valley remains in place, but has changed in form and purpose. The Pennsylvania Railroad's main line has become Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line, where heavy freight traffic still runs, but passenger service has been reduced to once per day on Amtrak's Pennsylvanian. Passengers no longer board trains at Pitcairn Station; it's yards have been converted into NS's Intermodal Terminal. The Edgar Thopmson Steel Works and Union Railroad still operate, now under the control of U.S. Steel and its subsidiary Transtar. Westinghouse's railroad is gone, but his airbrake facility still operates at its original site under the name Wabtec; the Westinghouse electrical plant is now the Keystone Commons industrial park, and portions of the foundries in Trafford have become baseball facilities, with other parts awaiting redevelopment. The Turtle Creek Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad served out its final three decades as a privately owned short-line, the Turtle Creek Industrial Railroad, before flooding from the creek prompted its end of service and eventual conversion into part of the Westmoreland Heritage Trail. The coal mines in the Turtle Creek watershed have all closed, but the abandoned mine drainage they emit continues to adversely effect the aquatic life in the creek. Watershed The Turtle Creek watershed is highlighted, with the dividing lines for its USGS subwatersheds shown in red. Photo of the George Westinghouse Bridge over the Turtle Creek Valley. The Turtle Creek watershed is the region drained by Turtle Creek. Sixty-six percent of its area is in Westmoreland County, with the balance in Allegheny County. The watershed's area is . It drains forests, farmlands, abandoned mines, and urban and suburban communities. The watershed includes portions of 33 municipalities. The lower watershed drains a heavily industrial area between the cities of Pittsburgh and McKeesport. The number of \\"subwatersheds\\" within the Turtle Creek Watershed depends on which organization defines the boundaries of these geographical regions. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) divides the Turtle Creek Watershead into four subwatersheds, giving each a 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC). The Turtle Creek Watershed Association (TCWA), motivated by guidelines which stated that a watershed should be \\"2 to 15 square miles\\" in size, has further divided most of the USGS subwatersheads into 14 subwatershed planing units. Both the USGS's and the TCWA's defined watersheds are listed in the table in this section. {  center\\" - efefef;\\" Designator Subwatershead Sq mi Sq km - USGS 050200050701 67.42 132.22 - TCWA Upper Turtle Creek 12.98 33.62 - TCWA Steel's Run  4.81  12.46 - TCWA Haymaker Run 10.97 28.41 - TCWA Abers Creek 10.64 27.56 - TCWA Middle Turtle Creek 19.24  7.43 - TCWA Lyons Run  8.78 22.74 - USGS 050200050702 80.63 148.92 - TCWA Upper Brush Creek 26.13 67.68 - TCWA Bushy Run 13.94 36.10 - TCWA Lower Brush Creek 17.43 45.14 - USGS 050200050704 18.43 47.73 - TCWA Lower Turtle Creek 10.02 25.95 - TCWA Dirty Camp Run  3.23  8.37 - TCWA Sawmill Run  2.02  5.23 - TCWA Ardmore Run  3.16  8.18 - USGS 050200050703 15.87 41.10 - TCWA Thompson Run 15.87 41.10 - } Flow Alterations Channelization B-Y Pond in Trafford, PA was formed when the flow of Turtle Creek was shortened to accommodate a railroad, which has since become the rail-trail in the foreground The flow-line of Mid-twentieth century Turtle Creek meandered noticeably less than it did a hundred years earlier, particularly in its lower regions between Trafford and the mouth of the creek at the Monongahela River. This artificial channelization of the creek was prompted by industrialization of the region. Diversions to suit the expanding railroads of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had the most obvious impacts, while alterations to suit the needs of George Westinghouse's manufacturing companies and Andrew Carnegie's steel operations are also evident in changes shown in historical maps of the creek. Wall Yard in 1895. The dashed lines show the flow-line of the creek before the yard was built In 1852 the Pennsylvania Railroad Company began running its main line along the left bank of the lower section of Turtle Creek in 1852. In 1874 it acquired 215 acres of land for its Wall Yard (later known as Pitcairn Yard), construction of which would involve relocating much of Turtle Creek northward before the completion of the yards on the left bank of the creek in 1892. Sometime between 1903 and 1915 the creek was further diverted to straighten the tracks of the railroad on its right bank, where the Westinghouse Interworks Railway company ran its trains. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company also diverted the flow of the creek in the Blackburn neighborhood of Trafford, PA to create a wye (pronounced like the letter \\"Y\\") to enable its trains to switch directions there. The pond formed by part of the old creek-bed eventually took a name derived from that of Blackburn's farm and this wye, \\"B-Y Pond\\". Turtle Creek served as part of the political boundary between what were once North Versailles and Patton townships, as well as part of the boundary between Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties. When the flow-line of the creek was altered, the political divisions were not redrawn, and so some seemingly out of place borders now exist near the banks of Turtle Creek. For example: a portion of US Steel's Edgar Thomson Works which appears to be in North Braddock is actually in North Versailles. Businesses in Broadway Park on PA Route 130 are also in North Versailles, but have addresses in Monroeville. The Pitcairn Intermodal Terminal (formerly Pitcairn Yard, and Wall Yard before that) lies in both Monroeville and North Versailles, but, ironically, not in Pitcairn. All American Park, a baseball and softball complex built at a former Westinghouse site in Trafford, has some fields which straddle the Allegheny / Westmoreland County border. Westinghouse Dams By 1908, no fewer than two dams were known to exist on Turtle Creek; both were built at water intakes for industrial facilities. One was at the Westinghouse Machine Company in East Pittsburgh; it was described as being low and not appreciably obstructing the flow of the stream. The Trafford dam, located just upstream of Turtle Creek's confluence with Brush Creek, was more imposing, once standing at eight feet tall and 50 feet wide in the shadow of the bridge which carried PA Route 130. When the Westinghouse plant in Trafford closed, the nearby dam had outlived its original purpose. The water which pooled around the dam had found use as a swimming hole by those who would break through the fence around it, and this was considered a potential drowning hazard, in part due to the currents which could form around the dam. The dam was also hazardous to fish and other aquatic life, promoting a rise in water temperature which causes a decrease in its dissolved oxygen, while physically impeding the migration of fish up and down the stream. It not only blocked the travel of fish, but also that of local canoeists, who described the dam as \\"dangerous, unrunnable and unportageable\\". The Trafford dam was finally removed in September 2013. Flood Control The Westinghouse Floodgates in East Pittsburgh PA in 2017 Because of their relatively low elevation with respect to that of the Monongahela river, the Westinghouse facilities in East Pittsburgh and Turtle Creek were vulnerable to back water flooding, when the waters of the Monongahela reach such a height as to cause water to back up into the Turtle Creek channel. This happened multiple times, notably during the Great St. Patrick's Day flood of 1936. The Westinghouse Floodgate project was constructed from 1937 to 1938 for the purpose of blocking similar floods from backing up into the Turtle Creek channel. The project consisted of two adjoining floodgates, one 80x30 foot gate which could be lowered to block the creek itself, and an adjoining 40x20 foot gate that would be simultaneously block (Old) Braddock Avenue, which runs parallel to Turtle Creek in its floodplain. On the left bank of the creek next to the gates stands a gatehouse/pump-house, which held three 5000 hp pumps capable of pumping 7500 cubic feet of water downstream per second in the event that the gates needed to be lowered. The height of the gates meant that they could withstand backwater from the Monongahela river as long as the river surface remained below 750 feet above sea level. In 1999 the Turtle Creek Valley Council of Governments determined that operating and maintaining the facility placed too great a financial burden upon the boroughs of Wilmerding, Turtle Creek and East Pittsburgh. Photos taken in 2013 indicate the floodgate facility is no longer being maintained. Some of the channel improvements in the lower section of Turtle Creek, as illustrated for a 1967 model by the United States Army Corps of Engineers While the Westinghouse Floodgates would protect the lower Turtle Creek Valley from backwater flooding from the Monongahela River downstream, it was not designed to protect from flash flooding pouring down from tributaries upstream. Flash floods in 1911, 1942 and 1950 all deposited rain at a rate which exceeded the capacity of Turtle Creek to drain it., and in October 1954 the remnants of Hurricane Hazel caused what was then the flood of record by attempting to discharge 12,300 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) through a Turtle Creek channel which had a drainage capacity of only 5100 cfs, overflowing its banks and causing an estimated $13 million in damages. The following year the Turtle Creek District Flood Authority was organized, which would work with the Army Corps of Engineers on a massive channelization project whose design and construction would continue into the next decade. From its confluence with Brush Creek in Trafford to a point 2.2 miles downstream, Turtle Creek would be channelized to the extent needed to accommodate a flow equal to that caused by Hazel. For the 3.8 miles downstream to the river the channel would be further improved with stone and concrete walls and a similarly lined bottom, affording a 20,000 cfs capacity for this more heavily developed, lowest section of the creek. Construction of the concrete channel lining was completed in 1967, and control was turned over to the local flood authority who is expected to maintain the channel at its constructed drainage capacity by occasionally removing accumulation of sediment, vegetation and other debris. The channel proved adequate to discharge the rainfall caused by the remnants of Hurricane Agnes in June 1972 (13,200 cfs at East Pittsburgh), Hurricane Ivan in September 2004 (9760 cfs at Wilmerding), and a non tropical cyclone-related flash flood in June 2009 (10,100 cfs at Wilmerding). The flow of Turtle Creek is directed through a concrete flood protection culvert in Export, PA The June 2009 flood not only damaged the Thompson Run valley, but also flooded parts of Turtle Creek several miles upstream of the concrete-lined lower section. The town of Export, which the upper section of Turtle Creek flows through, sustained nearly $2 million in damages from this flood alone. Construction on its flood control system began in 2010, and work on the $9.8 million project was completed in the fall of 2012. The completed project begins just upstream of Puckety Drive, with a levee near the eastern edge of the Dura-Bond steel tube coating facility. The levee contains a small removable gate though which the tracks of the company's Turtle Creek Industrial Railroad pass, though the railroad's services were halted due to damage from the 2009 flood and it would never resume regular operation. The levee directs Turtle Creek into a concrete channel that runs beneath the road and continues for 1315 feet. At this point low flow waters are allowed into the natural Turtle Creek stream channel alongside Old William Penn Highway, while excess flow is directed underground through an additional 2905 feet of culvert to rejoin the meandering stream on the west side of Export. Initially, a second phase of construction with additional protective elements was planned, which was needed for \\"full 100-year protection\\", but state officials later decided that the second phase was not necessary and the protection from a \\"50 year storm\\" provided by phase 1 of the project would suffice.

Overview thumb In many modern cities, automobiles are convenient and sometimes necessary to move easily. When it comes to automobile use, there is a spiraling effect where traffic congestion produces the 'demand' for more and bigger roads and removal of 'impediments' to traffic flow. For instance, pedestrians, signalized crossings, traffic lights, cyclists, and various forms of street-based public transit, such as trams. These measures make automobile use more pleasurable and advantageous at the expense of other modes of transport, so greater traffic volumes are induced. Additionally, the urban design of cities adjusts to the needs of automobiles in terms of movement and space. Buildings are replaced by parking lots. Open-air shopping streets are replaced by enclosed shopping malls. Walk-in banks and fast-food stores are replaced by drive-in versions of themselves that are inconveniently located for pedestrians. Town centers with a mixture of commercial, retail, and entertainment functions are replaced by single-function business parks, 'category-killer' retail boxes, and 'multiplex' entertainment complexes, each surrounded by large tracts of parking. These kinds of environments require automobiles to access them, thus inducing even more traffic onto the increased road space. This results in congestion, and the cycle above continues. Roads get ever bigger, consuming ever greater tracts of land previously used for housing, manufacturing, and other socially and economically useful purposes. Public transit becomes less and less viable and socially stigmatized, eventually becoming a minority form of transportation. People's choices and freedoms to live functional lives without the use of the car are greatly reduced. Such cities are automobile-dependent. Automobile dependency is seen primarily as an issue of environmental sustainability due to the consumption of non-renewable resources and the production of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. It is also an issue of social and cultural sustainability. Like gated communities, the private automobile produces physical separation between people and reduces the opportunities for unstructured social encounters that is a significant aspect of social capital formation and maintenance in urban environments.  Negative externalities of automobile  Automobile Inefficiencies According to the Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector made by the Delft University and which is the main reference in European Union for assessing the externalities of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are: * congestion and scarcity costs, * collision costs, * air pollution costs, * noise pollution costs, * climate change costs, * costs for nature and landscape, * costs for water pollution, * costs for soil pollution and * costs of energy dependency. Addressing the issue There are a number of planning and design approaches to redressing automobile dependency, known variously as New Urbanism, transit-oriented development, and smart growth. Most of these approaches focus on the physical urban design, urban density and landuse zoning of cities. Dr. Paul Mees, a transport planning academic formerly at the University of Melbourne, argues that investment in good public transit, centralised management by the public sector and appropriate policy priorities are more significant than issues of urban form and density. There are, of course, many who argue against a number of the details within any of the complex arguments related to this topic, particularly relationships between urban density and transit viability, or the nature of viable alternatives to automobiles that provide the same degree of flexibility and speed. There is also research into the future of automobility itself in terms of shared usage, size reduction, roadspace management and more sustainable fuel sources. Car-sharing is one example of a solution to automobile dependency. Research has shown that in the United States, services like Zipcar, have reduced demand by about 500,000 cars. In the developing world, companies like eHi,eHi Carrot, ZazcarZazcar and Zoom have replicated or modified Zipcar's business model to improve urban transportation to provide a broader audience with greater access to the benefits of a car and provide\\"last-mile\\" connectivity between public transportation and an individual's destination. Car sharing also reduces private vehicle ownership. A diagram showing an inverse correlation between urban density and car use for selected North American cities Urban sprawl and smart growth Whether smart growth does or can reduce problems of automobile dependency associated with urban sprawl has been fiercely contested for several decades. The influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Newman P and Kenworthy J, Gower, Aldershot, 1989. The study has been criticised for its methodology,MINDALI, O., RAVEH, A. and SALOMON, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162. but the main finding, that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted, but the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar. Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and exurban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.e.g. FRANK, L. and PIVOT, G., 1994. Impact of Mixed Use and Density on Three Modes of Travel. Transportation Research Record, 1446, pp. 44-52. This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection:Transport Reviews Volume 29 Issue 3 (2009) was entirely devoted to this issue people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low-density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour.e.g. Bagley, M.N. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2002) The impact of residential neighborhood type on travel behavior: A structural equations modeling approach. Annals of Regional Science36 (2), 279. More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally rejected these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.e.g.Handy, S., Cao, X. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2005) Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment10 (6), 427-444. The paradox of intensification Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on automobile use, Melia et al. (2011)Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (In Press) The Paradox of Intensification. Transport Policy 18 (1) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth. Planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use. These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification: *All other things being equal, urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs. At the citywide level, it may be possible, through a range of positive measures to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion that would otherwise result from increasing population densities: Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in reducing automobile dependency and constraining increases in traffic despite substantial increases in population density. This study also reviewed evidence on local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development, positive measures (like improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: * intensify and accept the local consequences * sprawl and accept the wider consequences * a compromise with some element of both * or intensify accompanied by more direct measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and carfree zones.

If completed, the building would stand at , with 93 floors, becoming the tallest building in Miami and Florida. One Bayfront Plaza would primarily consist of offices and hotel space, but also would include a retail mall, condominiums, and parking garage on the lower levels, as well as possibly an observation deck at the top. The entire project consists of over of Class A office and hotel space, as well as a total building area of over including the large podium. One Bayfront Plaza is the first skyscraper over to be approved for construction in Miami. The building's primary advocate is real estate developer Tibor Hollo, who has won several awards for his 55 years as a developer in Miami, and is currently the president of Florida East Coast Realty. One Bayfront Plaza has gone through several design revisions since its original proposal as a single, 80 floor, tower, which exceeded height restrictions. It was first approved as a complex of two connected towers as shown in the rendering below and was to be known as the 100 South Biscayne complex with the taller tower being high. The development was planned to include an adjacent, connected 850-room hotel tower referred to as 100 South Biscayne II. Both buildings in the complex had a scheduled groundbreaking in 2011, and were estimated to be completed by 2015. Most recent news suggests the development is back to a single 1,010-foot tower design with a large podium, which was given a possible 2014 groundbreaking; however, by 2014 it was stated that the project was being put off at least until the completion of FECR's under construction Panorama Tower in 2017. History One Bayfront Plaza was originally proposed as a office and hotel tower. The design included of office space, a 650-room hotel and a 3,000 space parking garage. However, due to the height limits for buildings in downtown Miami and the possibility of interference with aviation traffic going into and coming out of Miami International Airport, it was unlikely that the building would be approved for construction with the proposed height. The FAA conducted hundreds of impact surveys in the downtown area and negotiated with many building developers during the mid-2000s boom to lower the planned heights of their buildings. One example is 900 Biscayne Boulevard, located just a few blocks to the north of the OBP site, which was reduced from to . The FAA reasoned that the skyscrapers interfered with their radar, in addition to being a physical hazard to landing planes. The redesigned One Bayfront Plaza was approved at its exceptional height of 1,049 feet due to its determination by the city as a significant landmark and because it got a Major Use Special Permit (MUSP). In July 2007, a revised design of the building was released. The new design scaled back the height to , and the floor count of the building was reduced to 70. The major feature of the new design was the incorporation of a separate hotel building to be located adjacent to the tower. The main tower was to be all office space. This revised design was subsequently approved by the City of Miami on July 25, 2007, but construction never began. In the fall of 2008, the building's height was scaled back again slightly due to new zoning laws to its current design as a single, 80-floor, 1,010-foot tower. The single tower would contain residential space at the bottom, accounting for the higher floor count. This design of the tower was to incorporate fluid dampers used to absorb wind gusts and create energy efficiency for the skyscraper. The tower was designed to resemble a sail to reflect the bay it overlooks. In mid-2011 it was announced that the project was still alive and that the plan should be ready in 14 months. It was also announced that architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox had been chosen to work on the project to help TERRA Architecture with the design. The plan was released in early 2012 and included another redesign of the tower. In 2016, the project was revived as a 93-story mixed-use building, with 1,000 parking spaces and a commitment to the Metromover connection. Design and location The existing building at 100 South Biscayne. One Bayfront Plaza will be located at a waterfront site along Biscayne Boulevard, overlooking both Biscayne Bay and Bayfront Park. A pedestrian bridge will connect it to the Bayfront Park Metromover station located directly in front of it. The development will total , including 700 residential units, retail, and of office space, as well as two hotels totaling over 600 rooms. The groundbreaking of One Bayfront Plaza was scheduled to take place in 2011. The late construction date set at that point was mostly because an 18-story, building built circa 1959, also marketed as One Bayfront Plaza, already exists on the 100 South Biscayne site, and is still a profitable office building. This building must be demolished before construction can begin. However, as recently as March 2011, three-year leases were being offered on the existing building, suggesting a new start date no earlier than 2014. In late 2012 it was reported that leases in the existing building ran until the end of 2014. The Florida East Coast Realty Group, the building's developer, estimates that the building will take no more than three years to complete, and had estimated an opening sometime in 2015, now pushed back to 2017 or later. The 80th floor of the original design was planned to be an observation deck, the first one in Miami. The complex was later redesigned as two 70-floor towers, with the main tower being all office space, hence taller. The shorter tower was to be all hotel space. The current design goes back to a single mixed-use tower with 80 floors on a large podium with the top floors being office space and the bottom being hotel or residential space. The observation deck can be seen in the schematic diagram. Two FECR published sources have gone back to the floor count of 80 with the 1,010-foot design, and renderings of this design from 2009 show an observation deck, as well as the Metromover connection, in the blueprints. Height With a planned height of , One Bayfront Plaza will likely become the tallest building in Miami upon completion. The tower is also the only building planned to rise over that has ever been approved in Miami. One Bayfront Plaza would surpass the Panorama Tower, which is currently the tallest building both in Miami and the state of Florida. At its original height of 1,180 feet, which exceeded FAA height restrictions and was never approved, it would have been one of the tallest buildings in the United States, and its second proposed height of 1,049 feet, which was approved in 2007 under old zoning, would have made it only slightly shorter than the Chrysler Building in New York by . The height was reduced to its current due to height restrictions in the new Miami 21 zoning laws. In 2015, FAA height limits were set more clearly, again at a maximum of , though One Bayfront Plaza had its approval renewed at AMSL, shorter than One Brickell City Center, approved at . 100 South Biscayne II 100 South Biscayne II was the name of the proposed hotel tower that would have been located adjacent to the main One Bayfront Plaza tower in the 100 South Biscayne complex, connected at the bottom by the large retail area and parking garage making up the podium. The tower was planned to rise with 70 floors and would have consisted of an 850-room hotel with a convention center. 100 South Biscayne II was approved on July 25, 2007, and groundbreaking was scheduled to take place in 2011. It has been canceled as the final design scale back has remerged the development back into one mixed-use tower. See also *List of tallest buildings in Miami *The Towers by Foster + Partners *One Brickell City Center Notes : A. ^ Due to several design revisions, sources are conflicting between 70 and 80 floors for the current 1,010-foot design. It is possible that the 1,049 design which was to be all office space with the hotel separate would only contain 70 floors while the current mixed use tower could reach 80 floors in less total height due to the smaller floor heights of residential space.

The variant is similar to the Andalusian Spanish variety spoken in Western Andalusia and (especially) to Caribbean Spanish and other Hispanic American Spanish vernaculars because of Canarian emigration to the Caribbean and Hispanic America over the years. Canarian Spanish is the only Spanish dialect in Spain to be called usually espa√±ol, instead of castellano. Canarian Spanish heavily influenced the development of Caribbean Spanish and other Latin American Spanish vernaculars because Hispanic America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands were originally largely settled by colonists from the Canary Islands and Andalusia; those dialects, including the standard language, were already quite close to Canarian and Andalusian speech. In the Caribbean, Canarian speech patterns were never regarded as either foreign or very different from the local accent. The incorporation of the Canary Islands into the Crown of Castile began with Henry III (1402) and was completed under the Catholic Monarchs. The expeditions for their conquest started off mainly from ports of Andalusia, which is why the Andalusians predominated in the Canaries. There was also an important colonising contingent from Portugal in the early conquest of the Canaries, along with the Andalusians and the Castilians from mainland Spain. In earlier times, Portuguese settled alongside the Spanish in the north of Gran Canaria, but they died off or were absorbed by the Spanish. The population that inhabited the islands before the conquest, the Guanches,The term Guanche originally referred to the aborigines of Tenerife, but nowadays it is used commonly to refer also to the aborigines of the rest of the islands. spoke a variety of Berber (also called Amazigh) dialects. After the conquest, the indigenous Guanche language was rapidly and almost completely eradicated in the archipelago. Only some names of plants and animals, terms related to cattle ranching and numerous island placenames survive. Their geography made the Canary Islands receive much outside influence, with drastic cultural and linguistic changes. As a result of heavy Canarian emigration to the Caribbean, particularly during colonial times, Caribbean Spanish is strikingly similar to Canarian Spanish. Grammar *As with most other varieties of Spanish outside Mainland Spain, the preterite is generally used instead of the perfect: hoy visit√© a Juan (\\"today I visited John\\") for hoy he visitado a Juan (\\"today I have visited John\\"). *Like most other varieties of Spanish outside central and northern Spain, ustedes is used for all second- person plurals: ustedes est√°n is used for vosotros est√°is. Only on a few parts of the islands of El Hierro, La Palma and La Gomera is the pronoun vosotros still sometimes used, and even there, it is decreasingly and generally only by older speakers. In La Gomera and some parts of La Palma, ustedes vos vais is used. Archaic forms like vaivos are still used in some areas. *Like most other varieties of Spanish outside Mainland Spain, syllables are suppressed in some diminutives: cochito for cochecito (\\"small car\\") and florita for florecita. *As with many other varieties of Spanish outside Mainland Spain, de (\\"of\\") is deleted in some expressions: casa Marta for casa de Marta and gofio millo for gofio de millo. Pronunciation *Seseo, the lack of distinction between the pronunciation of the letters and or \\"soft\\" , is the most distinctive non- mainland characteristic; caza ('hunt') is pronounced exactly like casa ('house'), which occurs in Andalusia as well. The feature is common to most parts of the Spanish-speaking world outside of the northern three quarters of Mainland Spain (Castile and the surrounding provinces have adopted the feature). * is debuccalized to at the end of syllables, as is common in Andalusia, Extremadura, and Murcia and much of Spanish America. * (spelled as or, before or , as ) is usually aspirated (pronounced ), as is common in Andalusia (especially in its west) as well as in much of Spanish America. *Word-final is realized as a velar nasal . Vocabulary Canarian vocabulary has its own regionalisms different from standard Castilian Spanish vocabulary. For example, guagua (\\"bus\\") differs from standard Spanish autob√∫s. The word guagua is an onomatopoeia stemming from the sound of a Klaxon horn (\\"wawa\\"). An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb fajarse (\\"to fight\\").fajar at Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola. In standard Castilian Spanish, the verb would be pelearse, while fajar exists as a non- reflexive verb related to the hemming of a skirt. The term of endearment socio is a very popular Canarian term. The Canarian vocabulary has a notable influence from the Guanche language, especially in the toponymy. In addition, many Canarian names come from the Guanche language, such as Airam, Gara, Acerina, Aydan, Beneharo, Jonay, Tanaus√∫, Chaxiraxi, Ayoze, Yaiza and Zebenzu√≠. As Canarian Spanish was influenced by Andalusian Spanish, a few words of Andalusi Arabic origin are found, and there are some doublets of Arabic-Latinate synonyms with the Arabic form being more common in Canarian, such as alcoba for standard habitaci√≥n or dormitorio (\\"bedroom\\"), alhaja for standard joya (\\"jewel\\"), or alacr√°n for standard escorpi√≥n (\\"scorpion\\"); Arabic influence in Canarian Spanish was also brought by returning Canarian settlers and their children from Spanish Sahara after its independence.

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2007 NFL Draft and also played for the Arizona Cardinals. He played college football at Nebraska. Early years Bradley played just one season of football as a junior at Highland High School in Salt Lake City, Utah, due to injuries, starting at safety. He also starred in rugby and won 3 straight national championships with the Highland Club in Salt Lake City. College career Bradley was a three-year starter at the University of Nebraska as a strong-side linebacker and in 43 games, registered 175 tackles, 25 TFLs, 4 sacks, 3 FFs, 4 FRs, and 1 INT, which he returned 43-yds for a touchdown. He enrolled at Nebraska in 2002, spending the season as a defensive end on the scout team. In 2003, he appeared in all thirteen games as a reserve left defensive end, moving to that position after playing at middle linebacker in preseason camp. He managed only six tackles (4 solos) with three stops for losses and four pressures as an edge rusher. He also earned Academic All-Big Twelve Conference honors. He made the move to strong-side linebacker in 2004 and finished 2nd on the team with 67 tackles after serving as a reserve defensive end the previous two seasons. He missed most of the 2005 campaign with torn ACL in left knee but finished with 26 tackles (11 solos), three sacks and five stops for losses and added seven quarterback pressures and returned an interception 43 yards for a touchdown. Bradley led the Cornhuskers in tackles with 76 (6 for losses) in 2006 and also added 1 sack, 3 FF, and 4 FR. Professional career Philadelphia Eagles Bradley was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2007 NFL Draft. On December 23, 2007 Bradley had his first sack, and first interception in an Eagles win over the New Orleans Saints in the Superdome. Bradley finished with six tackles, one sack and one interception. During the game, he also essentially single-handedly stopped the Saints from scoring from inside the five-yard line four plays in a row. Bradley became the first player in NFL history to start in his first NFL game and make his first interception and first sack at the same time. In 2007, Bradley was a solid reserve linebacker and key special teams performer in his rookie campaign, finishing 2nd on the team in special teams tackles (17) and 3rd in special teams production points (257). Sheldon Brown, a starting cornerback for the Browns said that Bradley reminded him of Brian Urlacher in terms of his body type and athletic ability. On January 6, 2009, Bradley was named to the 2008 Sports Illustrated All-Pro team in only his first year as a starter. Bradley tore his ACL during Eagles Flight Night, a night where fans can watch the players practice at Lincoln Financial Field, before the 2009 season on August 2, 2009. He was placed on injured reserve on September 1, and missed the entire season. Arizona Cardinals Bradley was signed by the Arizona Cardinals on July 29, 2011. In a move to gain salary cap relief, Bradley was cut on March 1, 2013. Denver Broncos Bradley was signed by the Denver Broncos on March 13, 2013.Broncos add linebacker Stewart Bradley He was placed on injured reserve by the Broncos on August 31, 2013, ending his season.

An air-mass thunderstorm, also called an \\"ordinary\\", \\"single cell\\", or \\"garden variety\\" thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm that is generally weak and usually not severe. These storms form in environments where at least some amount of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is present, but very low levels of wind shear and helicity. The lifting source, which is a crucial factor in thunderstorm development, is usually the result of uneven heating of the surface, though they can be induced by weather fronts and other low-level boundaries associated with wind convergence. The energy needed for these storms to form comes in the form of insolation, or solar radiation. Air-mass thunderstorms do not move quickly, last no longer than an hour, and have the threats of lightning, as well as showery light, moderate, or heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall can interfere with microwave transmissions within the atmosphere. Lightning characteristics are related to characteristics of the parent thunderstorm, and could induce wildfires near thunderstorms with minimal rainfall. On unusual occasions there could be a weak downburst and small hail. They are common in temperate zones during a summer afternoon. Like all thunderstorms, the mean-layered wind field the storms form within determine motion. When the deep-layered wind flow is light, outflow boundary progression will determine storm movement. Since thunderstorms can be a hazard to aviation, pilots are advised to fly above any haze layers within regions of better visibility and to avoid flying under the anvil of these thunderstorms, which can be regions where hail falls from the parent thunderstorm. Vertical wind shear is also a hazard near the base of thunderstorms which have generated outflow boundaries. Life cycle Stages of a thunderstorm's life The trigger for the lift of the initial cumulus cloud can be insolation heating the ground producing thermals, areas where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture rapidly cools into liquid drops of water due to the cooler temperatures at high altitude, which appears as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding dry air. The air tends to rise in an updraft through the process of convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This creates a low-pressure zone beneath the forming thunderstorm, otherwise known as a cumulonimbus cloud. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5√ó108 kg of water vapor is lifted into the Earth's atmosphere. As they form in areas of minimal vertical wind shear, the thunderstorm's rainfall creates a moist and relatively cool outflow boundary with undercuts the storm's low level inflow, and quickly causes dissipation. Waterspouts, small hail, and strong wind gusts can occur in association with these thunderstorms. Common locations of appearance Also known as single cell thunderstorms, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool unstable air which often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term \\"cell\\" refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary which sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term \\"air mass thunderstorm\\". When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized due to the minimal vertical wind shear in the storm's environment and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Between formation and dissipation, single cell thunderstorms normally last 20‚Äì30 minutes. Motion Anvil shaped thundercloud in the mature stage over Swifts Creek, Victoria The two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, or the lowest of the Earth's atmosphere. Younger thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than more mature thunderstorms as they tend not to be as tall. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, moves ahead of the thunderstorm, the thunderstorm's motion will move in tandem with the gust front. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP), such as air-mass thunderstorms. When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.  Convective precipitation  Calvus type cumulonimbus cloud Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from cumulonimbus clouds. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds such as thunderstorms have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective. Graupel and hail are good indicators of convective precipitation and thunderstorms. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts. High rainfall rates are associated with thunderstorms with larger raindrops. Heavy rainfall leads to fading of microwave transmissions starting above the frequency of 10 gigahertz (GHz), but is more severe above frequencies of 15 GHz. Lightning Downward motion of cooler air from thunderstorms spreads outward in all directions when the environmental wind flow is light Relationships between lightning frequency and the height of precipitation within thunderstorms have been found. Thunderstorms which show radar returns above in height are associated with storms which have more than ten lightning flashes per minute. There is also a correlation between the total lightning rate and the size of the thunderstorm, its updraft velocity, and amount of graupel over land. The same relationships fail over tropical oceans, however. Lightning from low precipitation (LP) thunderstorms is one of the leading causes of wildfires. Aviation concerns In areas where these thunderstorms form in isolation and horizontal visibility is good, pilots can evade these storms rather easily. In more moist atmospheres which become hazy, pilots navigate above the haze layer in order to get a better vantage point of these storms. Flying under the anvil of thunderstorms is not advised, as hail is more likely to fall in such areas outside the thunderstorm's main rain shaft. When an outflow boundary forms due to a shallow layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional wind shear can result at the leading edge of the three-dimensional boundary. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become.T. T. Fujita (1985). \\"The Downburst, microburst and macroburst\\".

The route runs from DE 279 and DE 896 in Newark east to DE 48 in downtown Wilmington. The route passes through suburban areas in northern New Castle County between Newark and Wilmington, intersecting DE 72 in the eastern part of Newark, DE 273 in Ogletown, DE 58 in Christiana, DE 7 in Stanton, DE 141 in Newport, DE 62 and DE 100 between Newport and Wilmington, and Interstate 95 (I-95)/U.S. Route 202 (US 202) in Wilmington. DE 4 is a four-lane road much of its length. What is now DE 4 was originally a county road that was paved in the 1930s. DE 4 was designated in the 1960s to run from the Maryland border along Chestnut Hill Road near Newark east to DE 48 in Wilmington. Between 1971 and 1981, the route extended past DE 48 along Washington Street and Washington Street Extension to US 13 Business (US 13 Bus.) in Bellefonte. In the 1980s, the western terminus of DE 4 was realigned from Chestnut Hill Road to the newly built Christiana Parkway, terminating at DE 2 (now DE 279) and DE 896\\\\. Route description DE 4 westbound and DE 896 northbound on the Christiana Parkway past South College Avenue in Newark DE 4 begins at an intersection with Elkton Road in the city of Newark, which heads southwest as DE 279 and northeast as DE 896\\\\. From here the route heads southeast concurrent with DE 896 on the three-lane undivided Christiana Parkway, carrying two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. The road runs through wooded areas and passes over the Christina River before it comes to a bridge over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line. The roadway curves east and widens into a four-lane divided highway as it passes to the south of the University of Delaware's Science, Technology, and Advanced Research campus. At the intersection with South College Avenue DE 896 splits to the south. A park and ride lot is located at the southeast corner of this intersection. DE 4 continues east near Delaware Stadium and the Bob Carpenter Center on the University of Delaware campus to the north, intersecting Chestnut Hill Road. At this point the road becomes Chestnut Hill Road and runs between farmland to the north and residential neighborhoods to the south as it comes to a crossing of Norfolk Southern's Delmarva Secondary railroad line at-grade. The road heads into commercial areas and intersects DE 72, with a park and ride lot situated southeast of the intersection. Past this intersection, DE 4 leaves Newark and continues east along Chestnut Hill Road. The road heads into suburban Brookside, passing through residential neighborhoods with some businesses and curving to the northeast. The route continues to Ogletown and passes to the southeast of the Delaware School for the Deaf before it has an intersection with Salem Church Road and an interchange with DE 273\\\\. At this point, the name changes to Ogletown Stanton Road. Following this, the road heads into Christiana and passes to the north of Christiana Hospital. Beyond the hospital, DE 4 comes to an intersection with the western terminus of DE 58 and Delaware Park Boulevard, the latter of which is an access road to Delaware Park ‚Äì which consists of a thoroughbred horse racetrack, casino, and golf course ‚Äì and the Churchmans Crossing station on SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line that runs along the Northeast Corridor. The route continues through commercial areas with some woods and curves east to reach an intersection with DE 7. DE 4 westbound past Old Churchmans Road near Christiana At this point, DE 4 turns north for a concurrency with DE 7 on the six-lane divided Stanton Christiana Road, running through wooded areas with nearby development, including the Hale-Byrnes House, and passing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line and the White Clay Creek and Mill Creek near their confluence. The road passes to the east of Delaware Park and curves northeast into Stanton. At this point, the two routes head into a commercial area and split into the one-way pair of Mitch Road eastbound and Main Street westbound. DE 7 splits from DE 4 by heading northwest on Limestone Road. DE 4 continues east along the one-way pair past homes and businesses with two lanes in each direction, crossing Red Clay Creek. The directions of the route rejoin and the route becomes four-lane divided West Newport Pike, heading through suburban areas and crossing Hershey Run. DE 4 enters the town of Newport and splits into the one-way pair of West Market Street eastbound and West Justis Street westbound. The route has an interchange with the DE 141 freeway and the one-way pair becomes East Market Street eastbound and East Justis Street westbound. The two directions of DE 4 rejoin and the route continues northeast as four-lane undivided East Newport Pike. The road leaves Newport and heads between suburban neighborhoods to the northwest and Banning Park to the southeast. The route intersects DE 62 and becomes Maryland Avenue, passing a mix of homes and businesses. The road comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of DE 100 before crossing Little Mill Creek, passing north of a park and ride lot, and crossing CSX's Market Street Industrial Track railroad line at-grade. DE 4 continues into the city of Wilmington and passes rowhomes and businesses. The route passes under I-95/US 202 and comes to a ramp from northbound I-95/US 202\\\\. Past this, DE 4 enters downtown Wilmington and splits into the one-way pair of Maryland Avenue eastbound and South Monroe Street westbound before ending at DE 48, which is routed on the one-way pair of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard eastbound and West Second Street westbound. The section of DE 4 between Harmony Road near Christiana and Jackson Street in Wilmington is part of the Washington‚ÄìRochambeau Revolutionary Route, a National Historic Trail. DE 4 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 53,651 vehicles at the east end of the DE 7 concurrency to a low of 12,723 vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE 48. The entire length of DE 4 is part of the National Highway System. History DE 4 eastbound approaching eastern terminus at DE 48 in Wilmington By 1920, what would become DE 4 existed as a county road. The road from Stanton to Wilmington was paved four years later and the portion west of Stanton was paved by 1936. In 1936, work was underway to improve the road between Stanton and Newport by widening and resurfacing it, with completion a year later. In 1957, Maryland Avenue between Silview and Boxwood Road was widened to four lanes and the one-way pair along Market Street and Justis Street in Newport was established. The present DE 4 designation first appeared in 1967, at which point it ran from the Maryland border near Newark east to DE 48 in Wilmington, following Chestnut Hill Road from the state line before picking up its current alignment southeast of Newark. By 1971, the route was extended northeast to US 13 Bus. in Bellefonte, forming a brief concurrency with DE 48 before continuing along Washington Street and Washington Street Extension. DE 4 was truncated back to DE 48 by 1981, with DE 3 being realigned to the easternmost part of Washington Street Extension three years later. The portion of DE 4 concurrent with DE 7 was widened into a divided highway in 1985, with the road shifted west to a new alignment passing over the Amtrak tracks and the White Clay Creek. The Christiana Parkway around the southern edge of Newark was completed in September 1983 and DE 4 was realigned to use the Christiana Parkway by 1987, ending at DE 2 (Elkton Road) in the southwestern part of Newark. DE 896 was rerouted to use the Christiana Parkway the following year with DE 2 following by 1990. In 1997, an interchange was constructed with DE 273 in Ogletown as part of a realignment of DE 273 in the area that eliminated a short concurrency with DE 4. The concurrent DE 2 designation was removed from the Christiana Parkway in 2013 as part of simplifying the route numbers in Newark.

It was the first suicide attack by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Background In 1994, Hani Abed, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative, brokered an alliance between Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. (Hani was later assassinated by Israel). As part of the alliance, Hamas's chief bombmaker, Yahya Ayyash, built the three bombs used by Islamic Jihad for the Beit Lid suicide attack. Each was made using plumber's pipe (one foot long and eight inches (203 mm) wide) and five kilograms of military-grade TNT, surrounded by nails.Katz, 166-167 The Beit Lid junction is a well-known waypoint towards Netanya. Strategically, it is an important crossroads between Tel Aviv and Haifa located on Highway 4. \\"On Sunday mornings, Beit Lid was swamped with thousands of young soldiers and aging reservists heading back to military duty from weekend leaves\\". Ashmoret Prison is located in the southwest corner of the Beit Lid junction. At the time of the bombing, Ahmed Yassin, founder of Hamas, was being held there. The attack Scene after the bombing. On 22 January 1995, at approximately 9:30 am, a Palestinian suicide bomber, disguised as an Israeli soldier, approached the bus stop at the Beit Lid junction in central Israel. The bus stop was full of Israeli soldiers who were on their way to their bases after their weekend vacation. The suicide bomber walked into the crowd and detonated the hidden explosives belt he was wearing. About fifteen minutes later a second suicide bomber exploded at the same spot, killing and injuring people wounded in the first explosion, as well as bystanders who had rushed to the scene to assist the victims of the first explosion.

She was scrapped in 1973. History She was named in honor of lieutenant (junior grade) Charles Arthur Tabberer who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, posthumously, for his heroic efforts in helping to cause the Japanese 26th Air Flotilla‚Äîwhich had opposed the American Guadalcanal invasion force‚Äîto turn back. Tabberer (DE-418)s keel was laid down at Houston, Texas on 12 January 1944 by the Brown Shipbuilding Co. The ship was launched on 18 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Mary M. Tabberer, and commissioned on 23 May 1944, Lt. Comdr. Henry Lee Plage, USNR, in command. 1944 On 27 June 1944, Tabberer headed toward Bermuda for shakedown training. At the end of a fortnight's post-shakedown availability at the Boston Navy Yard, she got underway on 16 August to escort the oiler to the Hawaiian Islands. The two ships transited the Panama Canal late that month and reached Pearl Harbor on 7 September. For over a month, the destroyer escort conducted underway training in the waters surrounding the islands. Her exercises included antisubmarine warfare drills and gunfire practice. She also screened carriers USS Coral Sea, , and during night flying qualifications and amphibious support training. On 16 October, Tabberer sortied from Pearl Harbor with Task Group (TG) 12.7, a hunter-killer group built around , formerly USS Coral Sea. Upon arrival at Eniwetok on 23 October, the ships joined Admiral Halsey's U.S. 3rd Fleet and, on 27 October, stood out of Eniwetok as task group TG 30.7. After stopping at Ulithi during the first three days of November, the task group headed for the 3d Fleet fueling group's operating area to conduct antisubmarine sweeps. On 18 November, task group TG 30.7 registered its first kill when Tabberers sister ship sent to the bottom after a coordinated depth charge attack with . Following a replenishment period at Ulithi, Tabberer sortied with TG 30.7 on 9 December to resume antisubmarine sweeps of the Philippine Sea during Task Force 38's Luzon strikes in support of the Mindoro landings. Typhoon Cobra On 17 December, as Tabberer was steaming in company with the 3d Fleet fueling group to the east of the Philippine Islands, rising wind and a choppy sea forced her to break off preparations to take on fuel. The barometer dropped precipitously as the weather grew worse. By evening, the warship was fighting a full typhoon, Typhoon Cobra. During the night, Tabberer lost steerageway and could not fight her way out of the deep troughs. She frequently took rolls up to 60 degrees and, on several occasions, approached an angle of 72 degrees from the vertical. The high winds and seas continued to batter her on the 18th. By 1830, her mast and radio antennas were gone. At 2130, a signalman trying to rig an emergency antenna sounded the \\"man overboard\\" alarm. Tabberer rushed to the rescue. Once on board, the sailor reported that he was from and that his ship had gone down about noon that day. Thus, she was the first ship of the U.S. 3rd Fleet to learn of the tragedy of 18 December 1944. Unable to call for help, she immediately embarked upon a search for other survivors. Her rescue efforts continued through the night, all day on 19 December, and into 20 December. In all, she saved 55 officers and men both from Hull and . Later, Tabberer was relieved by other units of the fleet, and they rescued an additional 36 men, a few of whom belonged to the crew of the typhoon's third victim . Outstanding rescue efforts during the storm won several members of Tabberers crew Navy and Marine Corps medals‚ÄîLt. Comdr. Plage, the Legion of Merit, and the ship, the Navy Unit Commendation. On 29 December, Admiral Halsey commended the crew when he visited the ship and awarded Lt. Comdr. Plage the Legion of Merit for his \\"courageous leadership and excellent seamanship\\". 1945-1946 On 21 December, the destroyer escort reentered Ulithi lagoon before heading back to Hawaii. She stopped at Eniwetok early in January 1945 and reached Oahu soon thereafter. Following a short availability, she stood out of Pearl Harbor on 29 January. She steamed via Eniwetok and Saipan to screen Task Force TF 38 during the air strikes in support of the U.S. Marines who stormed ashore at Iwo Jima on 19 February. Tabberer remained in the Volcano Islands through the first week of March, screening the carriers from enemy submarines and aircraft. Though the task force was subjected to several air attacks and carriers suffered kamikaze and bomb hits, Tabberer sustained no damage. On 7 March, she headed for the Philippines and entered San Pedro Bay Leyte, on 12 March. From late March to early May, the destroyer escort cruised with various task groups of TF 38 during the invasion of Okinawa. Once again, she protected the American carriers from Japanese submarines and aircraft while their planes struck enemy positions. Although she operated continuously for 52 days and sighted many unidentified planes, the ship never came under attack. Frequently, she rejoined the Anzio hunter/killer group for night antisubmarine sweeps. Tabberer put into Apra Harbor, Guam, on 11 May to replenish and make repairs. On 23 May, she departed again and rejoined Anzio for further antisubmarine operations on the sea lanes between Okinawa and the Marianas. On 31 May, Anzio planes scored a kill, and Tabberer assisted in recovering evidence of their success. Following a visit, lasting just over a fortnight, to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, she resumed antisubmarine sweeps with the Anzio task group. For the remainder of the war, she hunted Japanese submarines and protected the logistics group during the 3d Fleet's final air assault on the Japanese home islands. During the final month of the war, she destroyed mines and rescued four downed Anzio air crewmen. After the cessation of hostilities on 15 August 1945, Tabberer remained in the Far East to support the occupation forces. She escorted ships between Okinawa; Jinsen, Korea, and Tientsin and Taku, China. She also destroyed mines in the Yellow Sea. On 22 December, the little warship departed Tsingtao, China, to return to the United States. Along the way, she made stops at Okinawa, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor before entering San Francisco, California, on 15 January 1946. In April, she shifted to San Diego, California, where she was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 24 April 1946. 1951-1959 Tabberer was recommissioned at San Diego on 7 April 1951, Lt. Comdr. Willard J. McNulty in command. In June, she changed home ports from San Diego to Newport, Rhode Island, and in August reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet. For the next nine years, she operated along the Atlantic seaboard from Key West, Florida, to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Frequently, she operated in the Caribbean area, often near Guant√°namo Bay and Vieques Island. Tabberer participated in a variety of exercises and, on several occasions, embarked U.S. Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen for their summer cruises. She left the western Atlantic only once during this period‚Äîin the fall of 1957‚Äîfor a two- month deployment to the Mediterranean. After that, she resumed her operations along the east coast. Fate On 19 April 1959, the destroyer escort put into port for the last time. At Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she began preparations for deactivation. Tabberer was placed out of commission, in reserve, in May 1960 and was berthed at Philadelphia for the remainder of her career. On 1 August 1972, her name was struck from the Navy List and, on 3 October 1973, she was sold for scrapping to Mr. David Hahn of Key West, Florida. Legacy Because of wartime censors, the story of the typhoon was largely muted during the war, with an emphasis on the rescue, which made national headlines. More recently, two major books have been published on the incident which highlight the story of riding out the typhoon and rescue operation. The 2007 book \\"Halsey's Typhoon: The True Story of a Fighting Admiral, an Epic Storm, and an Untold Rescue\\" by Bob Drury & Tom Clavin devotes a major portion to the rescue operation and how the ship was presented awards by Admiral Halsey himself. The account of Commander Plage is also highlighted in the recent book \\"Sea Cobra: Admiral Halsey's Task Force and the Great Pacific Typhoon\\" by Buckner F. Melton Jr. A 2007 History Channel documentary also highlighted the DE's role, and that an official court of inquiry recommended that Halsey be relieved of his duties after a second typhoon incident.

On the front sign, the bottom line of text changes every few seconds to list multiple destinations along the route. A SF Muni T Third Street light rail train with a Mylar roll headsign A destination sign (North American English) or destination indicator/destination blind (British English) is a sign mounted on the front, side or rear of a public transport vehicle, such as a bus, tram/streetcar or light rail vehicle, that displays the vehicle's route number and destination, or the route's number and name on transit systems using route names. The main such sign, mounted on the front of the vehicle, usually located above (or at the top of) the windshield, is often called the headsign, most likely from the fact that these signs are located on the front, or head, end of the vehicle. Depending on the type of the sign, it might also display intermediate points on the current route, or a road that comprises a significant amount of the route, especially if the route is particularly long and its final terminus by itself is not very helpful in determining where the vehicle is going. Technology types Several different types of technology have been used for destination signs, from simple rigid placards held in place by a frame or clips, to rollsigns, to various types of computerized, electronically controlled signs, such as flip-dot, LCD or LED displays. All of these can still be found in use today, but most transit-vehicle destination signs now in use in North America and Europe are electronic signs. In the US, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 specifies certain design criteria for transit- vehicle destination signs, such as maximum and minimum character height-to- width ratio and contrast level, to ensure the signs are sufficiently readable to visually impaired persons.Destination and route signs (guidelines for), section 39 within Part 38 (Accessibility Specifications for Transportation Vehicles) of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In the 2010s, LED signs have replaced flip-dot signs as the most common type of destination sign in new buses and rail transit vehicles. Rollsign MBTA Red Line in Boston. This sign has a hand crank to change the destinations displayed, but many rollsigns are motorized. A motorized rollsign changing For many decades, the most common type of multiple-option destination sign was the rollsign (or bus blind, curtain sign, destination blind, or tram scroll): a roll of flexible material with pre-printed route number/letter and destinations (or route name), which is turned by the vehicle operator at the end of the route when reversing direction, either by a hand crank or by holding a switch if the sign mechanism is motorized. These rollsigns were usually made of linen until Mylar (a type of PET film) became the most common material used for them, in the 1960s/70s. They can also be made of other material, such as Tyvek. In the 1990s rollsigns were still commonly seen in older public transport vehicles, and were sometimes used in modern vehicles of that time. Since the 1980s, they have largely been supplanted by electronic signs. A digital display may be somewhat less readable, but is easier to change between routes/destinations and to update for changes to a transit system's route network. However, given the long life of public transit vehicles and of sign rolls, if well made, some transit systems continue to use these devices in the 2010s. The roll is attached to metal tubes at the top and bottom, and flanges at the ends of the tubes are inserted into a mechanism which controls the rolling of the sign. The upper and lower rollers are positioned sufficiently far apart to permit a complete \\"reading\\" (a destination or route name) to be displayed, and a strip light is located behind the blind to illuminate it at night. A rollsign-equipped trolleybus in Arnhem, Netherlands When the display needs to be changed, the driver/operator/conductor turns a handle/crank‚Äîor holds a switch if the sign mechanism is motorized‚Äîwhich engages one roller to gather up the blind and disengages the other, until the desired display is found. A small viewing window in the back of the signbox (the compartment housing the sign mechanism) permits the driver to see an indication of what is being shown on the exterior. MAX system in Portland, Oregon, both fitted with rollsigns, in 2009. This photo illustrates how rolls/blinds allow use of color and of symbols, such as the airplane icon shown here. Automatic changing of rollsign/blind displays, through electronic control, has been possible since at least the 1970s, but is an option that primarily has been used on rail systems‚Äîwhere a metro train or articulated tram can have several separate signboxes each‚Äîand only infrequently on buses, where it is comparatively easy for the driver to change the display. These signs are controlled by a computer through an interface in the driver's cabin. Barcodes are printed on the reverse of the blind, and as the computer rolls the blind an optical sensor reads the barcodes until reaching the code for the requested display. The on-board computer is normally programmed with information on the order of the displays, and can be programmed using the non-volatile memory should the blind/roll be changed. Although these sign systems are normally accurate, over time the blind becomes dirty and the computer may not be able to read the markings well, leading occasionally to incorrect displays. For buses, this disadvantage is outweighed by the need (compared to manual) to change each destination separately; if changing routes, this could be up to seven different blinds. Automatic-setting rollsigns are common on many light rail and subway/metro systems in North America. Most Transport for London buses use a standard system with up & down buttons to change the destination shown on the blinds & a manual override using a crank. The blind system is integrated with a system controlling announcements & passenger information, which uses satellites to download stop data in a sequential order. It uses GPS to determine that a bus has departed a stop, and announce the next stop. Flip-disc display A flip-disc display on a bus In the United States, the first electronic destination signs for buses were developed by Luminator in the mid-1970s\\"Sign of the Times: Transit signs have evolved from curtain signs to the first electronic sign introduced by Luminator to the present ADA-regulated visual and audio signs\\". Mass Transit magazine, January‚ÄìFebruary 1993, pp. 30‚Äì32. Fort Atkinson, WI (USA): Cygnus Publishing. ISSN 0364-3484. and became available to transit operators in the late 1970s, but did not become common until the 1980s. These were flip-disc, or \\"flip-dot\\", displays. Some transit systems still use these today. Flap display Another technology that has been employed for destination signs is the split-flap display, or Solari display, but outside Italy, this technology was never common for use in transit vehicles. Such displays were more often used at transit hubs to display arrival and departure information, rather than as destination signs on transit vehicles. Electronic displays Full color LED destination sign on a train in Japan LED destination sign on a bus in Singapore LRT 1 LRV Coach 1016 LED destination sign on a train in Philippines Most present-day destination indicator signs consist of liquid crystal display (LCD) or light- emitting diode (LED) panels that can show animated text, colors (in the case of LED signs), and a potentially unlimited number of routes (so long as they are programmed into the vehicle's sign controller unit; some sign controller units may also allow the driver to write the route number and the destination text through a keypad if required). In many systems, the vehicle has three integrated signs in the system, the front sign over the windshield, the side sign over the passenger entrance, both showing the route number and destination, and a rear sign usually showing the route number. An internal sign, that could also provide different kinds of information such as the current stop and the next one, aside from the route number and destination, may also be installed.

The route runs from DE 9 near Delaware City north to DE 7 in Pike Creek. The route runs through suburban areas of northern New Castle County, passing through the eastern part of Newark. DE 72 intersects U.S. Route 13 (US 13), DE 1, and DE 7 near Delaware City, DE 71 in Williamsburg, US 40 east of Glasgow, and DE 2, DE 4, and DE 273 in Newark. Parts of DE 72 were built as a state highway during the 1930s. By the 1940s, the route was designated between DE 2 in Newark and DE 7 in Pike Creek along Paper Mill Road. The route was extended south to DE 9 in the 1960s. In 1980, the alignment was shifted to the east through Newark to bypass a railroad crossing on Chapel Street. Route description DE 72 northbound past US 13/DE 1 in Wrangle Hill DE 72 begins at an intersection with DE 9 adjacent to PBF Energy's Delaware City Refinery near the city of Delaware City, heading west on two-lane undivided Wrangle Hill Road. The road continues between the oil refinery to the north and farmland to the south before coming to an intersection with US 13 and the southern terminus of DE 7 in Wrangle Hill, where it widens into a four-lane divided highway. At this point, US 13 turns west for a short concurrency with DE 72 to a diverging diamond interchange with the DE 1 freeway, where US 13 splits north onto DE 1. Past this interchange, DE 72 narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and passes through a mix of farmland and residences, coming to an intersection with DE 71 in Williamsburg. Following this, the road curves to the northwest through a mix of homes and commercial establishments, crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. The route curves north and comes to an intersection with US 40 in a commercial area to the east of Glasgow. Past the US 40 intersection, DE 72 continues to the north on Sunset Lake Road, heading into wooded areas with some fields and residential development and crossing Belltown Run before closely running to the west of Norfolk Southern's Delmarva Secondary railroad line, heading across Muddy Run. The route crosses the railroad tracks at-grade to run along east side of the railroad tracks and heads across the Christina River before it widens into a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane as it comes to an intersection with Old Baltimore Pike. At this intersection, the route name changes to South Chapel Street and it passes through fields with some development, crossing under Interstate 95 (Delaware Turnpike) without an interchange. DE 72 enters the eastern part of the city of Newark and passes industrial parks before heading past businesses and residential neighborhoods as it comes to an intersection with DE 4\\\\. A park and ride lot is located at the southeast corner of this intersection. DE 72 northbound at DE 273 and western terminus of DE 2 in NewarkFollowing this intersection, the road narrows to two lanes as it heads through agricultural areas to the east of the University of Delaware campus. The route continues northeast onto Library Avenue and runs through woods as it comes to a bridge over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line. The road bends north into commercial areas, passing to the east of Newark High School and widening into a four-lane divided highway as it comes to an intersection with Delaware Avenue, which carries the eastbound direction of DE 273\\\\. Here, eastbound DE 273 turns north to join DE 72 and the road reaches an intersection where westbound DE 273 runs west on Main Street and DE 273 continues east as Ogletown Road. Past this intersection, DE 72 becomes concurrent with DE 2 and the name changes to Capitol Trail as it turns northeast and passes under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line. The road leaves Newark and heads northeast through residential areas, briefly becoming undivided as it crosses White Clay Creek. After the road crosses Middle Run, DE 72 splits from DE 2 by heading northwest on two-lane undivided Possum Park Road, crossing the stream again and running through a mix of fields, woods, and housing developments. In Milford Crossroads, the route turns northeast onto Paper Mill Road and curves north to pass between White Clay Creek State Park to the west and the Middle Run Valley Natural Area to the east, crossing Middle Run a third time. The road continues northeast into the suburban Pike Creek area, where it crosses Pike Creek. DE 72 turns east and becomes a four-lane divided highway immediately before it reaches its northern terminus at another intersection with DE 7. DE 72 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 40,800 vehicles at the north end of the DE 2 concurrency to a low of 5,397 vehicles at the US 13 intersection. The portion of DE 72 concurrent with DE 2 is part of the National Highway System. History What is now DE 72 originally existed as a county road by 1920. By 1931, the road was proposed as a state highway between present-day DE 9 and US 13 while what would become DE 72 north of Milford Crossroads was completed as a state highway. The road from present-day DE 9 to US 13 became a state highway a year later. On July 1, 1935, the remaining sections of the present-day route were transferred from the county to the state. The portion of the road between US 13 and US 40 was improved by the state in 1937, providing a better route to Baltimore and Washington, D.C. for residents in the Delaware City, Port Penn, and Odessa areas. DE 72 was designated by 1942 to run from DE 2 (Main Street) in Newark north to DE 7, following Chapel Street and Paper Mill Road. In 1939, suggestions were made to replace the bridge over the White Clay Creek along Paper Mill Road in Newark. Plans were completed for this bridge by 1942 but construction was postponed due to World War II. The concrete bridge carrying Paper Mill Road over the White Clay Creek was completed in 1947, with final work on the project finished in August 1949. By 1954, Sunset Lake Road was improved from a dirt road to a low-type bituminous road. The roadway between US 40 and Newark was paved by 1966. DE 72 was extended to its present southern terminus at DE 9 the next year, following Chapel Street, Sunset Lake Road, and Wrangle Hill Road. In 1980, the Chapel Street crossing of the Northeast Corridor rail line in Newark was removed, and DE 72 was realigned farther to the east to follow Library Avenue across the railroad tracks before continuing north on DE 2 and Possum Park Road to Paper Mill Road in Milford Crossroads. DE 2 was realigned to follow DE 72 around the eastern part of Newark on Library Avenue by 1990. In 2013, the DE 2 concurrency between DE 4 and DE 273 was removed due to the truncation of DE 2 to the DE 273 intersection. On April 29, 2016, Governor Jack Markell, DelDOT secretary Jennifer Cohan, and local officials attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a $7 million project that rebuilt the interchange with DE 1 into a diverging diamond interchange, the first such interchange in Delaware. The diverging diamond interchange configuration was put into place on November 19, 2016.

It is approximately long and flows through Radnor Township and Haverford Township. The creek's watershed has an area of and is highly developed. It has three named tributaries: Browns Run, Kirks Run, and Meadowbrook Run. Ithan Creek is within the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The creek was historically the site of several mills and has been subjected to numerous floods over the years. In 1902, a sewage company began dumping raw sewage into the creek, but this practice was stopped in 1905. The creek is in approved trout waters. It is the site of Ithan Valley Park, a small park with hiking and fishing opportunities and the Radnor Valley Country Club. Course Ithan Creek rises in a small valley just south of U.S. Route 30 in the community of Wayne, Pennsylvania. It flows west for several tenths of a mile before receiving its first tributary, Browns Run, from the right and turning south. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 320 and receives two small unnamed tributaries from the left. It flows alongside Interstate 476 and crosses it once. After a short while, it receives Kirks Run from the right near the community of Rosemont, Pennsylvania. It flows alongside the interstate for several tenths of a mile before passing under it again. Shortly thereafter, Ithan Creek enters Haverford Township, Pennsylvania and receives its largest tributary, Meadowbrook Run. It passes under Darby Road and meets its confluence with Darby Creek. Ithan Creek joins Darby Creek upriver of its mouth. Geography and geology Ithan Creek near its mouth at Darby Creek The elevation near the mouth of Ithan Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is above sea level. Ithan Creek is within the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The Piedmont Uplands section has generally old, hard upland rocks that eroded from the Appalachian Mountains. The rocks in the watershed date to the Precambrian Era and Lower Paleozoic Era. The surficial geology mainly consist of felsic gneiss and mafic gneiss formations, with small amounts of serpentinite near the mouth of the creek. Silvery mica schist is exposed along the creek. According to a report by the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, the exposures are rare in the vicinity of Ithan Creek. Two soil associations exist in the Ithan Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is present in a small part of the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent through the middle of the watershed. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep soil that rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. Most of the watershed is considered to have slightly erodible soil. Watershed The watershed of Ithan Creek has an area of . Its source is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Valley Forge, but its mouth is in the quadrangle of Lansdowne. Ithan Creek's watershed has a diversity of land uses, including residential (high density and low density), transportation facilities, offices, college campuses, and historic sites. Its culverts from Sproul Road to Iven Avenue are not sized correctly to manage moderate floods. There are brick structures located alongside the creek that are in poor condition. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 476, U.S. Route 30, and Pennsylvania Route 320. Ithan Creek is not considered to be impaired. History Ithan Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1177888. The village of Ithan along the creek was the first European settlement in modern-day Radnor Township in the seventeenth century. In 1826, an official report stated the following about mills on the creek: On August 5, 1843, heavy rains caused massive flooding on Ithan Creek. About a quarter million dollars of damage in property was assessed, and several lives were lost. Bridges on Ithan Creek sustained a damage of about $475. The Wayne Sewerage Company was incorporated on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek to build a sewer system and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed no threat to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State Board of Health filed a lawsuit against the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed. Several bridges have been built across Ithan Creek. A concrete tee beam bridge with a length of carries Sproul Road over the creek and was built in 1922. A bridge of the same type was built in 1930 and carries Conestoga Road over the creek. In 1932, a concrete arch bridge was constructed that carries Darby Road across Ithan Creek. A concrete slab bridge with a length of carries Clyde Road across the creek and was built that same year. Built in 1964, a prestressed box beam carries Bryn Mawr Avenue over Ithan Creek. Three years later, two concrete slab bridges were constructed to allow the Mid-County Expressway to cross the creek, both being across. The creek flooded substantially after Tropical Storm Nicole on September 30, 2010. A majority of households surveyed after the storm reported flooding in their basements. As a result, several watershed drainage recommendations were proposed. On August 13, 2018, heavy rains damaged a culvert and some pipes along Ramsey Run, a tributary of Ithan Creek. Several houses were flooded as Pennsylvania Route 320 become a flowing stream. A sink hole also opened next to the culvert. In May 2019, state government agencies repaired the culvert and pipes. Biology The creek is approved trout waters. Brown trout have been recorded to naturally reproduce in the creek. On the banks of the stream, populations of white-tailed deer are overabundant. The Ithan-Darby Creek Wetlands is listed on the Delaware County Natural Areas Inventory. It is a \\"notable significance\\" site. At the floodplain at the confluence of Ithan Creek and Darby Creek, the main trees species include silver maple, black willow, boxelder, and red maple. In the wetlands at this site, the main tree species include scattered black willow and silver maple. There are also patches of silky dogwood and wild rose, which are surrounded by assorted wetland plants such as herbs, grasses, sedges, and rushes. Monkeyflower, ironweed, joe-pye weed, and mountain mint can sometimes be seen in the wetland, and a variety of invasive species are a concern. Most of the original forest cover has been removed to allow for farming and residential development. Recreation Ithan Valley Park is a 19-acre park that is adjacent to the creek. It contains a hiking trail and has fishing opportunities. The construction of a ‚ÄúWillowstreams corridor‚Äù trail is actively underway next to the creek that will connect Haverford Reserve to Ithan Valley Park when completed. Radnor Valley Country Club is a golf course that borders the creek. Formerly crossing the creek, it was redesigned in 1968 to run north-south along the creek due to construction of Interstate 476.

Vol. I. Kjobehavn: Trykt hos Konrad Jorgensen i Kolding. 1881. pp. 73-83 (Tale nr. 10).

University of California Press. 1977. pp. 154-155. . Synopsis Boots summons the hares with the magical pipe. Illustration by John Moyr Smith for Tales from the Fjeld (1896). A king of a kingdom so small he could see every border from the towers on his castle, still was proud of it. Having a single daughter, he wished her to marry a man fit to be king. He declared that whoever brought him twelve of the finest pearls (to ensure the wooer was rich) and could perform certain tasks would marry her. Many princes and merchants brought the pearls but failed the tasks, and many tried false pearls and were turned away more quickly. A fisherman had three sons: Peter, Paul, and Jesper. One day he caught three dozen oysters, each of which had a fine pearl. It was decided that each son would have his chance to win the princess. On the way, Peter met the King of the Ants, who was battling the King of the Beetles and had been worsted; he asked for Peter's help, and Peter said he was too busy. Then he met an old woman, who asked what he was carrying; he said cinders, she said that, very well, it was cinders, and when he got to the castle, the pearls turned into cinders. He did not tell what had happened when he came home. Paul tried, and met the same fate. Jesper tried; he helped the king of the ants, who won the field with him, and told the old woman of his pearls. The old woman begged some food from him, since he could eat at the castle. He handed over his entire lunch. The old woman called him back and gave him a whistle that would bring back what he had lost. The king was not pleased with such a son-in-law. He had a sack each of wheat, barley, oats, and rye mixed together and told Jesper he had to sort them in a day. The ants did it for him. The maiden asks the shepherd for a kiss in exchange for a hare. Illustration by Henry Justice Ford for Andrew Lang's The Violet Fairy Book (1901). Then he was set to herd a hundred hares. Using the whistle, he kept them together. The king heard of it and resolved to stop him. A shabby girl begged for a hare to feed for guests; finally, Jesper agreed to give her one in return for a kiss, but then he whistled it back. A stout old woman, in peasant dress, came next. He agreed to give her one if she would tiptoe about him cackling like a hen, and then he whistled it back. An fat old man in a royal groom's livery came, and Jesper agreed to give him one if he stood on his head, and then whistled it back. The next day, the king set out a tub and said that Jesper must fill it with undoubted truths, and he would judge when that was. Jesper told about the girl, and that she was the princess; then about the woman, and that she was the queen; then about the old man‚Äîand the king declared that the tub was full, so Jesper married the princess, and the king decided he would be a good king if he looked after the people as well as he looked after the hares.

Contos populares portuguezes. Lisboa, Plantier. 1907. pp. 106-108. The motif of herding the hares also happens as an episode of the Bosnian fairy tale Die Pferde der Wilen: it begins with the youngest of three brothers standing guard in a meadow and capturing three magical horses (akin to ATU 530, \\"The Princess on the Glass Mountain\\") and continues with the king setting the task of building a golden ship that navigates on land and water (ATU 513).

Situated in the far north-eastern corner of the Northern Territory, the region covers an area of and had a population of approximately 10,345 in June 2018. East Arnhem Region was created under the Local Government Act (NT) 2008 to provide core local government services. The area comprises nine major remote communities, many homelands and outstations, commercial enterprises such as tourism, two mining leases, and pastoral properties scattered throughout the council area. Five of the nine communities are located on islands. Six of the communities are recognised Remote Service Delivery Sites by the Commonwealth and another is recognised as a NT Government Territory Growth Town. History In October 2006 the Northern Territory Government announced the reform of local government areas. The intention of the reform was to improve and expand the delivery of services to towns and communities across the Northern Territory by establishing eight new shires. The East Arnhem Shire was created on 1 July 2008. Elections of shire councillors were held on 25 October 2008. Banambi Wunungmurra was elected unopposed as the inaugural EASC president, with Councillor Keith Hansen of Anindilyakwa Ward serving from 2008 to 2010 as his deputy, then rotating the deputy position to Councillor Kaye Thurlow of Gumurr Marthakal from 2010 to 2012. Wunungmurra was re-elected unopposed in 2012, with Councillor Mavis Danganbarr of Gumurr Marthakal Ward currently serving as his deputy for a two-year term. On 1 January 2014, the shire became a region. Most of the land in the region was previously unincorporated, but the following communities were amalgamated into it: * Angurugu Community * Marngarr Community Wards and representation The East Arnhem Regional Council is divided into 6 wards, which is governed by 14 councillors: * Anindilyakwa Ward (2) - Groote Eylandt including Angurugu, Umbakumba and Milyakburra (Bickerton Island), and neighboring islands * Birr Rawarrang Ward (2) - Ramingining and surrounding areas * Gumurr Gatjirrk Ward (2) - Milingimbi and surrounding areas * Gumurr Marthakal Ward (3) - Elcho Island including Galiwinku and surrounding areas * Gumurr Miwatj Ward (3) - Yirrkala and Gunyangara (also known as Marngarr or Ski Beach) and surrounding areas * Gumurr Miyarrka Ward (3) - Gapuwiyak (Lake Evella) and surrounding areas Presidents President * Banambi Wunungmurra, 12 November 2008 - current Deputy president * Mavis Danganbarr, 11 April 2012 ‚Äì current * Kaye Thurlow, 10 November 2010 ‚Äì 11 April 2012 * Keith Hansen, 2 November 2008 ‚Äì 10 November 2010 Council members Anindilyakwa Ward * Jabani Lalara, 2 April 2012 - current * Constantine Mamarika, 2 April 2012 - current * Keith Hansen, 31 October 2008 -1 April 2012 * Keith Mamarika , 31 October 2008 - 1 April 2012 * Lionel Jaragba, 31 October 2008 - 17 November 2011 Birr Rawarrang Ward * Peter Djumbu, 2 April 2012 - current * Rose Wurrguwurrgu, 2 April 2012 - current Gumurr Gattjirrk Ward * Lily Roy, 24 April 2012 -current * John Ryan, 24 April 2012 - current * Alvin Marrpindiwuy Gaykamangu, 16 November 2011 - 1 April 2012 * Ronnie Garrawurra, 27 July 2011 - 1 April 2012 * Galirrimun Dhurrkay*, 7 March 2010 - 28 February 2012 * Burrbam*, 31 October 2008 - 11 August 2011 * Wuduwal*, 31 October 2008 - 25 May 2011 * David Daymirringu Warraya, 31 October 2008 - 7 November 2011 Gumurr Marthakal Ward * Alfred Gondarra, 2 April 2012 - current * Kaye Thurlow, 31 October 2008 - current * Mavis Danganbarr Garrawurra, 31 October 2008 - current * Don Wininba Ganambarr, 31 October 2008 - 1 April 2012 Gumurr Miwatj Ward * Barayuwa Mununggurr, 31 October 2008 - current * Yananymul Mununggurr, 31 October 2008 - current * Banambi Wunungmurra, 31 October 2008 - current Gumurr Miyarrka Ward * Gawura Wanambi, 2 April 2012 - current * Wesley Bandi Wunungmurra, 2 April 2012 - current * Indicates funeral name Localities and communities Land within the East Arnhem Region was divided during 2007 into bounded areas for the purpose of creating an address for a property.

Watelet's inherited privilege of farming taxes in the Orl√©anais left him free to pursue his avocations, art and literature and gardens.William Howard Adams, The French Garden 1500-1800 (New York: Braziller) 1979, pp 115ff. His Essai sur les jardins, 1774, firmly founded on English ideas expressed by Thomas Whately,Whately's Observations on Modern Gardening, illustrated by descriptions, appeared in London, 1770). introduced the English landscape garden to France, as the jardin Anglois. The sociable Watelet, who was born and died in Paris, was at the center of the French art world of his time. Biography Watelet was born in Paris, where he kept house in the rue CharlotThere d'Alembert was nursed back to health by Julie de Lespinasse, Colin Bailey records (Colin B Bailey, Patriotic Taste: Collecting Modern Art in Pre-Revolutionary Paris (Yale University Press) 2002, p. 65). and attended the Monday salons of Mme Geoffrin,Bailey 2002 where he would have seen La Live de Jully, who engraved one of Watelet's drawings and who, like Watelet, was an early patron of Greuze. Watelet was received as an honorary associate of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1754, at the same time as Bergeret de Grandcourt, another collector and connoisseur whose avocations were supported by the Ferme G√©n√©rale.Bailey 2002, p 65ff. In 1760 he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on the strength of his didactic poem L'Art de peindre.He was in time a corresponding member of several academies outside France: the Royal Academy of Berlin, Accademia della Crusca, the Academy of Cortona, the Institut of Bologna. The poem is composed in four chants devoted in turn to Design, Colour, Picturesque Invention and Poetic Invention. It is followed by precepts in prose on Proportions, Ensemble, Balance or Weight and Movement of the figures, Beauty, Grace,William Hogarth, who had written his own Analysis of Beauty in 1753, translated Watelet's essay on Grace; the manuscript, never published in Hogarth's lifetime, is at the University of Illinois.

Harmony of Light and Colours, Effects, and the Expression of the Passions. The second half of the work was decorated with his illustrative engravings and vignettes, for was a talented etcher: Denis Diderot said that if he had a copy of Watelet's poem L'Art de peindre he would cut out the illustrations and frame them under glass, and throw the rest in the fire.\\"Si le po√®me m'appartenait, je couperais toutes les vignettes, je les mettrais sous des glaces, et je jetterais le reste au feu.\\" An expanded version of the essays furnished the basis of Watelet's unfinished dictionary of the fine arts. About this time Watelet embarked on a lifelong affair with the pastellist Marguerite Lecomte, a young married woman whom he had been teaching the technique of etching. With her and his old tutor the abb√© Copette of the Sorbonne he made a second Italian tour, 1763‚Äì64. In Rome, two pensionnaires of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in Rome assembled a complimentary collection of poems by Luigi Subleyras,Luigi Subleyras was the son of the late French painter Pierre Subleyras (1699-1749), head of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in Rome. titled Nella venuta in Roma di madama le Comte e dei signori Watelet e Copette,\\"On the arrival in Rome of Mme Le Comte and the signori Watelet and Copette\\" (J.

Winckelmann took them to view the antiquities at the Villa Albani In the Essai sur les Jardins,The Essai has been translated by Samuel Danon, Essay on Gardens: A Chapter in the French Picturesque (University of Pennsylvania Press) 2003; it has an introductory essay by Joseph Disponzio. Watelet's experience of the Physiocrats informed his bucolic vision of a France that might be able to return to a simple agrarian economy based upon idealized models of the family- owned farm. He declared his devotion to the philosophy of Rousseau in the opening pages of his garden treatise, which gave a detailed account of the laying out of a ferme orn√©e, such as the English poet William Shenstone had pioneered at The Leasowes, begun in 1743. Watelet had preceded his essay with his own experiments in gardening on an island in the River Seine that he owned, at Colombes (Hauts-de-Seine); there between 1754 and 1772 he created a \\"picturesque setting unique in French gardens at the time it was created,\\" according to William Howard Adams.Adams 1979:116. The garden was a retreat from the Paris salons for many of the philosophes, and Watelet dedicated his Essai describing it to the spirit of amiti√©, \\"friendship\\" herself. The site of the garden is the parc d√©partemental Pierre Lagrav√®re, formerly called l'Ile Marante\\"; it was the subject of a semi-permanent exhibition at Colombes, Moulin Joly, un jardin au si√®cle des Lumi√®res, 2004-07 ([]) His Moulin Joly (\\"Pretty Mill\\") offered a residence, a farm, stables, a dairy, an apiary, a mill, walks, rides and vistas ornamented with sculpture, a flower garden and a physic garden, with a medical laboratory and an infirmary,Watelet was an honorary member of the Soci√©t√© Royale de M√©decine. uniting the beautiful with the useful. The inspiration for the new sensibility for an atmospheric garden ‚Äì which a plan of the Moulin Joly shows to have had perfectly straight rides through the woods,Adams 1979 fig.133, a plan of Watelet's Moulin Joly √† Colombes, ca 1780, at the Archives Nationales. is generally credited to the vision of painters in the generation of Watteau, who painted in the now- overgrown gardens laid out in the previous century. Watelin's inspiration may have come in part through his friend Boucher. In the 1740s Jean-Baptiste Oudry had access to the overgrown gardens of the prince de Guise at Arcueil and often brought younger artists to sketch with him in the neglected grounds; Boucher accompanied him on several occasions.Jennifer Milam, \\"Landscape fantasies and farm fictions in French drawings and prints during the ancien regime\\" Magazine Antiques (October 1995) Though his friendship with the painter Fran√ßois Boucher, and his art lessons in Italy with Hubert Robert during his youthful tour, the influences of Boucher and \\"Robert-les-ruines\\" were directly transferred to the new French gardens in the genre pittoresque. In 1780 the visionary neoclassical architect Nicolas Le Camus de M√©zi√®res dedicated to Watelet Le g√©nie de l'architecture, ou L'analogie de cet art avec nos sensations (\\"The Genius of Architecture, or the Analogy of That Art with Our Sensations\\"). Watelet's treatise appeared in the same year that Marie Antoinette's gardens round the Petit Trianon began to be remodelled; by 1783 two sides of the pavilion looked onto small glades of lawn encircled by sweeps and clumps of trees, and her petit hameau was finished, like a stage set for a pastorale, reflecting itself at the far end of a little lake no larger than a village pond. In Greuze's portrait (illustrated above), Watelet is shown with calipers in hand and a bronze reduction of the Venus de' Medici on his bureau plat, as if in the process of determining the secret of perfect proportions of the female body. Watelet wrote articles for the Encyclop√©die;Kafker, Frank A.: Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de ¬´ discours ¬ª de l'Encyclop√©die (suite et fin).

Wheeler produced viable economic wheat and fruit strains for a short prairie growing season with harsh winters. Known as the \\"Wheat King of the prairies\\" or \\"The Wheat Wizard of Rosthern\\" he owned and operated the Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm. He was designated as a person of national historic significance in 1988 by the Canadian federal government and inducted into the Saskatchewan Agricultural Hall of Fame. Seager came to Canada in 1885 and applied for his own homestead in 1890. His original homestead was located at NE Section 16 Township 38 Range 4 West of the 3rd Meridian, and he was aided by a loan from the Temperance Colonization Society Limited - Toronto Whereas the nearest present day town of Rosthern, Saskatchewan is located at Sec.35, Twp.42, R.3, W3. To get to the restored Seager Wheeler Maple Grove Farm travel 7 km east of Rosthern. Five separate entries of wheat which were grown at this farm location during 1911 to 1918 won World Wheat Championships. Morris Bodnar, Member of Parliament for Saskatoon‚ÄîDundurn, commemorated Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm as a National Historic Site of Canada on August 3, 1996. The site is honoured as the location where hardy wheat and fruit strains were developed which were well suited to the prairie climate and growing season. Life Born on the Isle of Wight, England in 1868, Wheeler emigrated to the Canadian prairies in 1885, the year of the North West Rebellion. He worked on various farms for five years before applying for his own homestead near Rosthern, Saskatchewan. He died in Victoria and is interred with his family in the Bergthal cemetery, near Rosthern, where he homesteaded. He co- authored a book with Herbert Joseph Moorhouse called ‚ÄúSeager Wheeler‚Äôs Profitable Grain Growing‚Äù. His life story by Jim Shilliday was published in 2007 by the Canadian Plains Research Center. History Seager Wheeler developed many dryland farming techniques, invented equipment as well as winning numerous awards for developing wheat strains and fruits which would grow in the short prairie season, seeds which would survive over winter and many other practices which helped develop a sustainable agricultural economy in Saskatchewan.

Biography Umezawa was born as the second son of a samurai in the service of the Sendai Domain, and attended the domain's academy \\"Yoken-do\\". During the Boshin War, he fought on the side of the pro-Tokugawa ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei against the forces of Emperor Meiji, including the Battle of Hakodate. After the war he was taken into custody by the new Meiji government, and following his release in 1869, he enlisted into the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. In the Satsuma Rebellion, Umezawa was a member of the IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment. Following the war, his rise through the ranks was rapid, and he became commander of the Guards 2nd Regiment in 1887 with the rank of major. With the start of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, he was assigned to the staff of the IJA 2nd Army, and was in charge of military logistics. he advanced to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was given command of the IJA 40th Infantry Regiment in September 1896. In February 1899 he was promoted to colonel. In March 1900, he was given command of the Guards 4th Regiment. With the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Umezawa was given a battlefield promotion to major general in July 1904; however, despite his long history of military service, Umezawa was regarded as a mediocre soldier by his superiors, and their lack of expectation was reflected by the fact that he was given command of the Guards Reserve 5th Infantry Brigade. This was a rear-duty garrison force composed primarily of over-age reservists armed with obsolete equipment (some of which was captured Russian weapons) and with low morale. Umezawa defied all expectations by improving morale and turning his second-rate force into a first-rate combat unit. At the Battle of Shaho, the IJA 1st Army became overextended, and the Russians mounted an attack on its exposed right wing. Umezawa's rear-guard brigade was all that was blocking the Russian forces from flanking the Japanese army. Despite an order to withdraw, Umezawa's reserve brigade held for three hours against three times their number of Russian front-line troops. The following morning, the Russians attacked with an even larger force, but the Umezawa Brigade still held. General Kuroki Tamemoto perceived that Umezawa's position was key to preventing a Japanese loss, and sent the IJA 12th Division and the IJA 2nd Cavalry Brigade as reinforcements, which finally turned the battle in Japan's favor. Umezawa was hailed as the hero of the battle, and his troops were given the name \\"Hana no Umezawa Brigade\\"Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo- Japanese War He subsequently served as commander of the Reserve Brigade of the Imperial Guards. In February 1906, Umezawa became commander of the Guards 2nd Brigade. From April to June 1907, he was sent as a military attache to the United States. In September 1911, he was promoted to lieutenant general and became commander in chief of the IJA 6th Division. In May 1914, he was awarded the 1st class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures, which he added to his existing collection of 2nd, 3rd and 4th class Order of the Golden Kite. Umezawa entered the reserves in October 1915. In his final years, he suffered from rheumatism; he died at the age of 72 in January 1924.

It is maintained by the USGS to preserve valuable rock cores, well cuttings and various other geologic samples for use by scientists and educators from government, industry and academia. The CRC is open to the general public for core viewings or tours of the facility by appointment only. The CRC houses the largest collection of rock cores and well cuttings in the nation. Core workshop at the CRC. History Established in 1974 by the USGS, in cooperation with the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, the CRC was designed as a permanent free-access core repository. Its goal was to rescue rock cores threatened with disposal or destruction, which continues today with the recent rescue of the Denver Basin drill core from Castle Pines North, Colorado. During the 1990s the CRC staff provided onsite core processing services to active scientific drilling programs. Slabbed section of the Calco #1 Ferch core. Depths are marked on the core in feet. Collections Archived Core Archived Cores have been slabbed, which means that it has been cut lengthwise, with a rock saw, which exposes a fresh flat surface to enhance the core viewing process. This also enables the cores to boxed and stored like books on a shelf, which allows for quick access to specific depth intervals. Thin Section of sandstone core as viewed through one of the CRC microscopes. Unprocessed Core The CRC unprocessed core collection contains 1.1 million feet of drilled core, from 31 states. This general collection contains materials from petroleum exploration and energy development holes. Unprocessed cores are in their original boxes and are stored on pallets in the CRC warehouse. Cuttings The CRC curates a large collection of well cuttings (rock chips) brought to the surface during drilling operations. This unique collection of cuttings represents 235 million feet of drilling. The USGS estimates that the replacement cost for this collection is around 10 billion dollars. Special Core Collections Aside from the general petroleum core collection, there are various sub-collections, including Eniwetok Atoll, Cajon Pass, USGS Yellowstone Drilling Program, Manson Impact Structure, plus more. Thin sections, photos, analysis Archived Cores are stored on shelves like books, allowing for quick and easy retrieval. In addition to the core and cuttings collections, the CRC also houses a collection of over 18,000 thin sections of core and cuttings that are viewed through microscopes by researchers. Photographs of archived cores are also available to researchers. Files are maintained for many wells that contain chemical and physical analyses, core descriptions, stratigraphic charts, and other analyses performed by daily users. Oil Shale Collection Rock saws are used for cutting samples for researchers. The Core Research Center has a large collection of drilled materials from the Green River Formation of Western Colorado, Eastern Utah, and Southwestern Wyoming. The collection contains cores from over 400 holes, along with associated thin sections and analytical data. Sampling The CRC does allow scientists to remove samples of material stored at the facility. There are special requirements and procedures in place to protect the material from oversampling.

Here, in this picture, which is a reproduction of a work from the Codex Zouche-Nuttall, a village is being sacked by some warriors. Mixtec writing originated as a logographic writing system during the Post-Classic period in Mesoamerican history. Records of genealogy, historic events, and myths are found in the pre-Columbian Mixtec codices. The arrival of Europeans in 1520 AD caused changes in form, style, and the function of the Mixtec writings. Today these codices and other Mixtec writings are used as a source of ethnographic, linguistic, and historical information for scholars, and help to preserve the identity of the Mixtec people as migration and globalization introduce new cultural influences. Mixtec history The Mixtec are an indigenous people of Mesoamerica, located in the western region of the modern Mexican states of Oaxaca, eastern part of Guerrero, and southern part of Puebla. The history of the Mixtec people can be traced back to the Formative period, and continues through the Classic and Post-Classic periods to the arrival of Europeans in 1520 AD. Today the region is still populated by the Mixtec and Mixtecan speakers. During the 2500 years before the arrival of Europeans, the Mixtec developed complex social and economic traditions, effectively exploited their diverse environment, created a method of writing, and maintained their autonomy from other civilizations, such as the Aztecs.Spores, Ronald M. 1984 The Mixtecs in Ancient and Colonial Times. The University of Oklahoma Press. Norman, Oklahoma The Mixtec language is part of the Otomanguean family of languages, a family found in Mesoamerican that includes Zapotec, another indigenous language found in Oaxaca. Mixtec speakers arrived in Oaxaca, notably the Alta region, during the early Formative period, 1500-750 BCE. Agriculture formed the base for Mixtec civilization and agricultural villages have been dated to 1350 BCE. Today Mixtec speakers are still found in Oaxaca and the neighboring regions of Puebla and Guerrero, though migration is spreading Mixtec speakers across Mexico and through the United States. The early Classic period, 200 BCE ‚Äì 300 CE, found the Mixtec civilization becoming more complex, with the adoption of a hierarchical settlement system. Artifacts and architecture display function and status differences reflecting this system of hierarchy. Urban centers were developed, the first of these being the core settlement of Yucuita. Yucuita was the largest and most complex of the early Classic urban centers, and existed for 500 years. It has been believed to be the possible capital of the Mixtec states during this period. The late Classic period was a continuation of the success and developments experienced during the early Classic period. The Post-Classic period dates from 1000 CE and ends with the arrival of Europeans in 1519. During this period the region was populated with tiny kingdoms, called se√±orios and cacicazgos, which were centered on prior urban centers. At this time the Mixtec experienced their greatest population, though there was a decline in monumental urban projects; areas and structures were being maintained and reused, while new ceremonial centers and projects were less numerous and less impressive. Despite this, the Mixtec were a source of influence for Mesoamerica during this period. The archaeological record has produced evidence of neighboring regions influencing Mixtec art and culture in the periods prior, while during the Post-Classic the role was reversed, with Mixtec influences permeating the region and the neighboring cultures. This sharing of culture is also found in the writing systems of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, as phonetic elements and symbols operated across cultures.Boone, Elizabeth and Walter D. Mignoto. 1994 Writing Without Words. Duke University Press. Durham, North Carolina. The arrival of the Spanish in Oaxaca in 1520 AD began the Colonial period. The Mixtec gave only minor resistance. The encomienda system was established in the region between 1525 and 1530 AD, and missionaries began their efforts to convert the Mixtec in 1538 AD. The arrival of the Spanish influence brought changes to the Mixtec culture, as is seen in the following example of the Mixtec writing system. A map showing the Mixtecs. Pre-Classic areas are marked with a triangle, round dots mark Classic sites and Post Classic sites are marked with a square. Mixtec writing and codices Mixtec writing is classified as logographic, meaning the characters and pictures used represent complete words and ideas instead of syllables or sounds. In Mixtec the relationships among pictorial elements denote the meaning of the text, whereas in other Mesoamerican writing the pictorial representations are not incorporated into the text. The characters used in Mixtec can be sorted into three types, pictographic symbols, ideographic symbols, and phonetic signs.Flannery, Kent V. and Joyce Marcus. 1983 The Cloud People. Academic Press Inc. New YorkTerracino, Kevin 2001 The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca Stanford University Press. Stanford, California Pictographic symbols can resemble the item they are intended to represent, and refer to one or more words. They are often found in person and place names. Ideographic symbols do not require knowledge of the Mixtec language to understand them, as they are found in other languages of the region and represent the idea which they are intended to portray. These symbols may also be referred to as ideograms or ideographs. The phonetic symbols used in Mixtec are important to the meaning of the words in which they are used, because Mixtec language is tonal. A tonal language relies on differences and inflections in the tone of a word to reflect the meaning of that word. These phonetic symbols indicate the tone of the spoken word, or represent instead a homonym of the intended word. The origin of the Mixtec writing system is unknown, but other Mesoamerican pre-Columbian writing systems, such as that of the Aztecs, are found to have similar traits. The Mixtec writing system is found on codices dating to the Post-Classic period preceding the arrival of the Europeans in 1520 AD. The Mixtec codices are writings recorded on decorated strips of bark and animal hide. The term codex (singular) is usually applied to bound books, though scholars use it to refer to Mesoamerican writings. The codices are constructed by folding bark over to form an accordion-like book, or by covering strips of bark and leather with plaster to form a smooth writing surface.Carmack, Robert M., Janine Gasco, Gary H. Gossen. 2007 The Legacy of Mesoamerica. History and Culture of a Native American Civilization. Prentice Hall Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Common topics found in the codices are biographies of rulers and other influential figures, records of elite family trees, mythologies, and accounts of ceremonies. Content of the biographic codices may be biased, as the subject individual might dictate the events and information they wished to be included, and it has been found that consulting additional codices allows better examination of the person or region from the different events and accounts portrayed. Some examples of surviving Mixtec writing lie in the Codex Zouche-Nuttall, which is now preserved in the British Museum. The Codex Zouche-Nuttall records a multitude of Mixtecan events, including some of the Mixtecan conquests between the 11th and 12th centuries, as well as some of the alliances forged. Despite this, it was made sometime in the 14th century. After the arrival of the Spanish in 1520 AD, the Mixtec writing system became hybridized with European writing styles and motifs. Some of these codices include European glosses, which facilitates translation when applied to the codices of the pre-Columbian period. Others show alphabetic writing replacing the pictorial traditional writing. Only indigenous authors participated in this hybrid style of writing, while Spanish writers used strictly European writing methods, reflecting their role as conquerors. The function of the codices changed during this period too; the ritual and divinatory aspects of the codices disappeared, while genealogical and culture records were maintained. New genres developed as a result of Spanish sponsorship, as they commissioned Mixtec authors to record information about the people and their past. It is difficult to know today whether the authors altered their information to appease the new European presence, or if their writings depict accurate representations of the Mixtecs at that time. In addition to being used as a tool for colonial power, Mixtec writings were admissible legal documents. Mixtec writings during the Colonial period were used to document and legitimate land claims of the hereditary nobility and to preserve and maintain the Mixtec culture. Origin myths continued to be recorded as part of genealogical records. The Church, knowing of the religious motifs and creation myths recorded in these codices, confiscated and destroyed them; it is believed many more codices were in existence before the Colonial period.  Calendar  Like most other Mesoamerican cultures, the Mixtec people had a 260-day sacred calendar. The days that made up this calendar were represented in Mixtec writing by the combination of a numeral, called the coefficient, and a certain sign or symbol. This numeral ranges between one and thirteen, while there are 20 signs which progress from crocodile to flower. The calendar moves in such a way that the numbers and signs move in parallel, so they start on crocodile, and move onto two Wind and three House. However, after thirteen Reed, the number resets, giving the next sign (which is a Jaguar at this point) an assigned coefficient of one. However, when seven flower is reached, the signs reset, but the coefficient continues to rise, giving eight crocodile. Years worked differently on the Mixtec calendar, and there were only four signs used to denote actual year-lengths. These were rabbit, reed, flint, and house. It was these signs and symbols that allowed Mixtec history to be traced to almost as far back as 940 CE, because the Mixtecs dated many important events with these signs and coefficients. Present day Today the codices are studied for their importance to the ethnohistory of the Mixtec and the region. Ethnohistoric data gathered from these codices can be applied and compared with other codices, European writings and records of events, and with the archaeological data of the Post-Classic and Colonial periods. In addition to these other materials, the study of Mixtec codices is supplemented by consulting the Mixtec who live in the areas featured in the writings. Examining the oral traditions associated with the codices provides a more complete understanding of the information and stories they hold, as they were often used for recitations and readings. During the twentieth century there was a resurgence in traditional writings across Mexico, coinciding with the Mexican Revolution and the emerging theme of national identity and unity. Today, the number of Mixtec speakers is around half a million people, spread across Mexico and the United States. Efforts by linguists, anthropologists, and Mixtecs are helping to preserve the language despite the influences of Spanish and English. Maintenance of the codices and the traditions they represent help modern Mixtecs to preserve and reclaim their historical traditions, and legitimize their culture with a positive identity of indigenous culture.Nagengast, Carole and Michael Kearney. 1990 Mixtec Ethnicity: Social Identity, Political Consciousness, and Political Activism.

Armour of this type has been used in the Middle East, North Africa, Ottoman Empire, Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Central Asia, Greater Iran, India, Eastern Europe, and Nusantara. Types In Russia there are three known varieties of mail and plate armour. These were adopted from Persia, initially as Persian exports, and have Persian names. * Behterets (), from Persian behter:Leonid A. Bobrov \\"Iron hawks from the territory of Maveranahr\\" (sets of the defensive equipment of the warriors of the Middle Asia and the neighbouring territories in 16th‚Äì17th centuries) small horizontal plates arranged in vertical rows without gaps, joined by rings, and embedded in mail. * Yushman (), from Persian jawshan: long horizontal plates embedded in mail and resembling laminar armour (e.g. Roman lorica segmentata) * Kalantar (): square plates embedded in mail, very similar to the Japanese karuta tatami-do.

Persian miniatures of the first half of 15th century show different combinations of mail and plate armour with lamellar armor and brigandines sometimes worn with a single round mirror plate as breast re-enforcement. The first representation of mail and plate armour as body protection is shown in Persian miniatures, which show mail and plate armour composed of relatively large plates, worn with laminar pauldrons and skirt (formed from long, horizontal plates), re-enforced by a large round mirror plate. The first representation of classic mail and plate armour (without lamellar elements) can be seen in Baghdad's miniature which dates from 1465. From the end of the 15th century mail and plate armour began to fully replace lamellar armours. The main difference between eastern European (Russian and Polish) and Oriental mail and plate armor (according to Bobrov) is that eastern European versions usually do not have sleeves, while Oriental versions have sleeves (the forearms were protected by vambraces). In a heavy version these sleeves have embedded plates, and a light version (more widely used) has sleeves entirely made from mail. In Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna (The Book of the Hidden Pearl) JƒÅbir ibn HayyƒÅn describes mail and plate armour for use in armours (jawasin), helmets (bid), and shields (daraq).Ahmad Y Hassan, The Colouring of Gemstones, the Purifying and Making of Pearls, and Other Useful Recipes In Japan mail and plate armour is called \\"karuta\\", small square or rectangular rawhide or metal plates with the gaps between them filled with mail.Ian Bottomley & A. P. Hopson, Arms and Armor of the Samurai: The History of Weaponry in Ancient Japan, pp. 88 & 91. The first known use of iron plate mail in Korea was used by the Gaya Confederacy between 42-562 AD. A large number of iron and steel artifacts, including iron armor, iron horse armor such as helmets and bits, and smaller iron ingots (often used as money), have been found in the Daeseong-dong tombs in Gimhae. Gimhae (ÍπÄÌï¥, ÈáëÊµ∑) literally means, \\"Sea of Iron,\\" as if the city's name symbolizes the abundance of iron in the area. Surviving examples are currently on display at the Gimhae National Museum in South Korea. The later Korean version of this armour is known as gyeongbeongap (Í≤ΩÎ≤àÍ∞ë/Èè°Âπ°Áî≤). The most famous general who used this type of armor was General Chonji.

It was modified by Porsche from the original Group C Jaguar XJR-14 from which it derived, and run by Joest Racing. Originally intended to race in the IMSA World Sportscar Championship, the WSC-95 saw very little race action even though it won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in both and without being acknowledged as a factory supported project. It was later upgraded to the Porsche LMP1-98 before being retired. Only two cars were ever built. Development In 1994, Porsche approved the beginning of a project to develop a prototype for the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) series, running under the World Sports Car (WSC) regulations. The car was not a factory-backed effort, yet was approved by Porsche and use some of their expertise and most of all their powerplant. Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) used the XJR-14 chassis number 691, modified by Porsche. For an engine, Porsche used one of their longest running motors, the Type-935 turbocharged Flat-6. Originally used in the Porsche 956 in the 1980s, the engine was still powerful enough to power modern prototypes. While Porsche's new 911 GT1s used a 3.2 Litre engine, the WSC-95 used a smaller 3.0 Litre engine. Although smaller, this gave the WSC-95 a better fuel economy than the 911 GT1, which was useful over long race distances. Unfortunately, the IMSA WSC regulations were changed prior to the 1995 season, leading to Porsche canceling the project. However, in February 1996 Reinhold Joest of the Joest Racing team convinced Porsche to give the unused prototype to his team, and for them to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With approval from Porsche, Joest put forth the money to allow for the construction of a second car from scratch, as well as the slight modifications to the existing car in order to meet the Le Mans Prototype (LMP1) regulations. Porsche agreed to help in the development of the car only if Joest agreed to pay for the services. Following the success of the WSC-95s in winning both the and 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans, Porsche decided to take over the project themselves. Both WSC-95 chassis underwent major revisions to their bodywork. The nose was raised in the middle, while to the sides sculpting allowed for the moving of the air intakes for the engine, necessitating the removal of the large scoop underneath the rollbar. The sides of the car were also redesigned, with the large opening for the radiator vents covered up while exhaust vents were also rearranged. The Type-935 Flat-6 was also upgraded, expanded out to 3.2 Litres. Having become a proper factory undertaking, the cars became officially known as the Porsche LMP1-98s.  Racing history  The two WSC-95s were completed just in time for Joest Racing to go to the Le Mans test session in May. There, the two cars showed their pace early by setting the fifth and tenth fastest times, easily beating the factory Porsche 911 GT1s. A few weeks later at Le Mans, the WSC-95s showed their improvements and the #8 entry was at the pole position, while #7 was seventh. However the 911 GT1s had also improved, taking the fourth and fifth fastest qualifying positions. During the race, the #7 WSC-95 led for nearly the entire race, although closely followed by the factory 911 GT1s. The #8 entry remained towards the front as well, although it succumbed to mechanical failures caused by a collision on the track during the closing hours. In the end, the #7 entry of Davy Jones, Alexander Wurz, and Manuel Reuter took the overall victory, a mere lap ahead of the following Porsche 911 GT1. WSC-95 chassis #002 on display in its 1998 Porsche LMP1-98 guise. Although Joest had originally intended to run the car just at Le Mans in 1996, the team decided to attempt once again in 1997 with a single car. A few weeks prior to Le Mans, Joest decided to showcase their car at the inaugural International Sports Racing Series event at Donington Park, where the car took a dominant victory. Upon returning to Le Mans they still showed their pace by once again taking pole position. Although still facing competition from the factory Porsche 911 GT1s as well as the new McLaren F1 GTRs, Nissan had now entered and were keen to take an overall victory. However, unlike the previous year, the 911 GT1s suffered various difficulties, both in the hands of the factory team but also for the privateers. The finish therefore came down to a close race between a McLaren F1 GTR and the WSC-95, with Joest Racing once again coming out the victor by a single lap. Ferrari Formula One team mates of and , Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson, drove with Le Mans rookie Tom Kristensen to take the win. It was the first of a record nine wins at Le Mans for Kristensen. Now realizing the potential of the abandoned WSC-95 against their 911 GT1, Porsche developed both chassis into the newer and even more capable LMP1-98. Unfortunately at the same time, not only were Porsche attempting to improve both the 911 GT1 and LMP1-98, but as were Nissan and the newcomers Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. Still run by the Joest Racing squad, the LMP1-98s showed that their quick pace was now lacking against new competitors, managing to take a best of only ninth in qualifying. During the race itself, although the LMP1-98s showed pace, they were not able to survive the entire race. One car suffered electronics difficulties after only 107 laps, while the second car broke some bodywork mountings in a spin and was not able to continue after it had completed 218 laps. For a final appearance, an LMP1-98 appeared at the debut Petit Le Mans in the United States. Alongside a lone 911 GT1, both cars showed great pace, but the LMP1-98 had to settle for second place, defeated by a customer Ferrari 333 SP by only a few seconds following ten hours of racing. The LMP1-98s were retired after 1998, with Porsche planning to develop their own Le Mans Prototype for 2000. That project was later cancelled, and Porsche did not return to factory prototype racing until the 2005 debut of the Porsche RS Spyder.

It was included in her revised edition of Henriette-Julie de Murat's last novel, Les Lutins du ch√¢teau de Kernosy (The Sprites of Kernosy Castle, 1710).Henriette- Julie de Castelnau de Murat, Le s√©jour des amans ou Les Lutins du ch√¢teau de Kernosy, 1773 Synopsis A king, whose kingdom was constantly imperiled by another king, had an only son who had fallen in love with a slave, Starlight. Her family was quite unknown, but he cared nothing for anything but her. Angry, the queen had the slave imprisoned in a tower. A beautiful white cat kept her company. The prince despaired. His father, because of a new attack, implored him to lead the army. The prince did, and the father promised that no one had harmed Starlight and that he would see her when he returned. He led the army and utterly defeated the other king's, capturing the king himself, but the king reneged on his promise. The prince freed the captive king, and the king and queen had him imprisoned. One day, Starlight confided to her cat that she was certain he had forgotten her, and the cat answered that he was also imprisoned. The cat then revealed herself as the fairy Ermine White, and told her that she was a princess. She gave her a box to be opened in her worst need, turned the tower in a stair for her escape, and made her promise to never tell who had freed her. She found the prince, and they concluded that she had to hide, which would cause his parents to free him, and send him a message of her refuge. The white cat warned them that the king's men were coming, and Starlight fled. She found her way to the forest, where centaurs found her; this was where they had taken refuge after the unpleasantness with the Lapiths at the wedding of Pirithous. They let her stay with them, and one bore her message to the court, that the prince could hunt a white doe with silver hooves in their forest. They met there, and went to the sea, where they found a marvelous ship awaiting them, with white cats as the sailors. They set sail, but Starlight confided in the prince how she had been rescued, and a storm overtook them. The waves separated them, carrying them to different countries. The prince was carried to a quiet country, where the women did the fighting, with crabapples. He found the king abed, resting, while his wife fought the war; he thrashed him and made him go to war himself; once there, he routed the enemies. But the kingdom was attacked and defeated, and the prince taken prisoner, whereupon he was put in a boat and lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness, he found himself in a ship that sailed by itself, back to his parents' kingdom, where he learned they had died of grief, and he was now king. He made peace with the centaurs but was always sad. His subjects proposed that he marry; he told them that he wished to marry only Starlight, but even a reward brought no news of her. Starlight had washed ashore and been found by a king who sheltered her. One day, his queen asked her for her story, and telling it, she revealed she was their long-lost daughter. Her father resolved to marry her to a neighboring king. She opened the box and was surrounded by a cloud that darkened her skin and made her ugly. The fairy Ermine-White carried her off, back to her prince, and in his court, she became herself again. They married.Marina Warner, ed., Wonder Tales: Six Stories of Enchantment (Chatto & Windus, 1994), p. 149-188, References Category:French fairy tales ","title":"Starlight (fairy tale)"},{"id":"10958930","text":"The Tiwi Islands Regional Council is a local government area of the Northern Territory, Australia.

Description  The face fly is similar to the closely related housefly but is slightly larger, averaging about 7 ‚Äì 8 mm long and grey in colour with four dark stripes on the thorax, with a grey-black patterned abdomen. Like many true flies, in the males, the eyes almost touch when viewed from above.  Distribution  Male Musca autumnalis Musca autumnalis is widespread throughout most of Europe, Central Asia, northern India, Pakistan, China and some parts of North Africa. It was introduced into North America around the 1940s and has now occupies a territory from southern Canada into most temperate parts of the United States. It was also introduced to St. Helena Island in the South Atlantic.  Lifecycle  Adult face flies will emerge from winter hibernation around March to early April. During the daytime, they feed on manure juices and plant sugars. On cattle and horses, they feed on secretions around the eyes, mouth and nostrils. The adult flies will also feed on the hosts' blood through wounds such as horse-fly bites. A larger proportion of face flies on the host will be females, as they have a higher need for protein provided by animal hosts. At night, both sexes will rest on vegetation. Females deposit eggs on fresh cow manure and these hatch within hours after deposition. The yellowish- white maggots feed on the microbial flora and fauna of the manure and pass through three larval stages (instars), growing to about 12 mm long, then developing into white pupae. They emerge as adults about 10 to 20 days after egg deposition, depending on the temperature.  As a vector of disease  M. autumnalis is considered a pest species, as it transmits the eyeworm Thelazia rhodesi to cattle and horses, and pinkeye (infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis) to cattle. As for human disease, M. autumnalis may have transmitted the eyeworm Thelazia gulosa to a woman's eye in Oregon in 2016 and to a second woman's eye in Carmel Valley, California in 2018.

Early life Alonso de Le√≥n Gonz√°lez was born in 1639, in the settlement of breckenridge,Texas (presently Montemorelos) within the province of Nuevo Le√≥n in New Spain. He was the third son of General Alonso De Le√≥n, a celebrated chronicler, historian and conquistador of the frontier of Nuevo Le√≥n, and Josefa Gonz√°lez.Chipman and Joseph (1999), p. 24. To distinguish him from his father, who was also a prominent leader in the colony, sometimes the phrase, El Mozo, would later be appended to his name (or its English equivalent, \\"the younger\\"). De Le√≥n trained in Spain for a naval career and joined the Spanish navy in 1657. By 1660 he had returned to Nuevo Le√≥n. He was frequently appointed to lead exploratory parties, and he became an entrepreneur, most notably in salt mining. De Le√≥n married Agustina Cant√∫ and had six children with her. Expeditions In 1684, French explorer La Salle led an ill-fated expedition which was intended to establish a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River. Instead, the colonists ended up on the Texas coast, where La Salle established a settlement. When Spanish leaders received word that the French had founded a settlement in the northern portion of their territory, De Le√≥n was chosen to lead the effort to locate and expel the French colonists. The first two expeditions, in 1686 and 1687, yielded no evidence of the French colony. One Frenchman, Jean Gery, was captured during the third expedition in 1688. It was during De Le√≥n's fourth expedition, in 1689, that he finally discovered La Salle's settlement, which had been abandoned by that time. Political offices and later life De Le√≥n served as mayor of Cadereyta from 1667 to 1675. He was governor of Nuevo Le√≥n from 1682 to 1684. In 1687, he was appointed governor of the region of Coahuila. He was involved in establishing San Francisco de los Tejas in 1690, the first Spanish mission in East Texas. In doing so, he blazed the trail for much of the Old San Antonio Road. During his expeditions, he named several Texas rivers, including the San Marcos River, the Guadalupe, the Medina, the Nueces, and the Trinity. De Le√≥n died in Coahuila on March 20, 1691.

It is the sole species in the genus Chorilaena. It has papery, broadly egg-shaped leaves with lobed edges and variously-coloured flowers arranged in umbels of five, the sepals and petals hairy on the outside and the stamens protruding beyond the petals. Description Chorilaena quercifolia is a bushy shrub that typically grows to a high and wide. The leaves are papery, broadly egg-shaped, long on a thin petiole about long. The flowers are usually green, sometimes yellow, white red or pink and are arranged in umbels of five on a downturned peduncle about long. The central flower is sessile, the surrounding four flowers on horizontally spreading pedicels about long. At the base of the sepals there are thread-like to spatula-shaped bracts and bracteoles that are about the same length as the flowers. The sepals are joined at the base with narrow triangular lobes about long and covered on the outside with woolly and star-shaped hairs. The petals are oblong to elliptical, long with star-shaped hairs on the outside and the stamens are two to three times as long as the petals. Flowering mainly occurs between October and February. Taxonomy Chorilaena quercifolia was first formally described in 1837 by Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher. The description was published in his book, Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de H√ºgel, based on plant material collected from King George Sound by Charles von H√ºgel. The leaves are shaped like those of an oak (genus Quercus), hence the specific epithet quercifolia. Distribution and habitat Karri oak grows on rocky coasts and on hillsides within of the coast between Cape Naturaliste and Bald Island in Western Australia. Conservation status This species is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The region covers an area of and had an estimated population of 6,863 people in June 2018. Geography MacDonnell Regional Council occupies the south of the Northern Territory and is the only LGA that borders with South Australia, specifically with Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara in the southwest and the Pastoral Unincorporated Area in the southeast. Alice Springs and Yulara are enclaves within the LGA. History In October 2006 the Northern Territory Government announced the reform of local government areas. The intention of the reform was to improve and expand the delivery of services to towns and communities across the Northern Territory by establishing eleven new shires. The MacDonnell Shire Council was created on 1 July 2008 as were the remaining ten shires. On 1 January 2014, it was renamed MacDonnell Region. Elections of shire councillors were held on 25 October 2008. The current President (Mayor) of the MacDonnell Region is Sid Anderson.

The election determined the composition of the 26th Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan New Democratic Party government of Premier Lorne Calvert was defeated by the Saskatchewan Party, led by Brad Wall. It was only the third time in the province's history that a centre-right party had won power. Campaign Lorne Calvert, Premier of Saskatchewan and leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), advised the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan to call an election for November 7, 2007. In the 2003 election, the NDP won 30 of 58 seats to form a majority government. The Saskatchewan Party, then led by Elwin Hermanson, won 28 seats in that election. Following that election, Hermanson resigned as leader, and Swift Current MLA Brad Wall was acclaimed as his successor in March 2004. Within a year after Wall took the leadership, the Saskatchewan Party unveiled a much more moderate policy platform in order to expand its support outside its rural base. This strategy paid off; by the spring of 2007 the Saskatchewan Party was well ahead in most opinion polling. The NDP promised to create places for 10,000 new post-secondary students, and to lower tuition fees by $1,000. The Saskatchewan Party countered with a promise of a tuition rebate of up to $20,000 after graduation, spread over seven years.\\"Saskatchewan Party‚Äôs victory appeals to students\\" , The Voice, Volume 15, Issue 43, November 16, 2007.

Plakida served as the Prime Minister of Crimea, an autonomous region in southern Ukraine, from 2006 to 2010 (the office of Prime Minister is also known as the Chairman of the Crimean Council of Ministers). He was the Representatives of the President of Ukraine in Crimea. Career Plakida served as the chairman of the Crimean Energy System UkrEnergo before becoming Prime Minister of Crimea. In early 2006, the Crimean Council of Ministers and the Crimean parliament removed the government of Crimean Prime Minister Anatoliy Burdiuhov. Plakida was nominated as the next Prime Minister by the Speaker of the Supreme Council of Crimea, which acts as Crimea's parliament. A power struggle ensued between Crimean politicians who were pro-Russian and those loyal to Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko. In early May 2006, politicians loyal to Yushchenko joined with four small political parties to create a 76-member majority in the Crimean parliament, which has 100 total members. This majority sought to block any pro-Russian candidates for Prime Minister of Crimea. The Constitution of Ukraine requires that the country's president approve of any candidate nominated for Prime Minister of Crimea. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko gave his approval after negotiations with Crimean political leaders and end the political impasse. In exchange for Yushchenko's approval of Plakida's candidacy, the Crimean parliament agreed to changes in the structure and membership of the Crimean Council of Ministers. Yushchenko signed off on Plakida's nomination on 29 May 2006. The Supreme Council of Crimea further approved Plakida as Prime Minister on 2 June 2006. Plakida received a majority of 75 votes in the parliament out 93 members. Plakida served as Prime Minister until March 2010, when he resigned from office. The Crimean parliament voted on 17 March 2010, to accept Plakida's resignation, with 71 members voting to accept his resignation and four voting against. He was succeeded by Vasyl Dzharty. President Viktor Yanukovych appointed Plakida as his acting presidential representative in Crimea in October 2010. Yanukovych dismissed Plakida in January 2011 in favor of Volodymyr Yatsuba, the former Minister of Regional Development and Construction. On 28 February 2012 Yanukovych appointed Plakida as his acting presidential representative in Crimea again.Plakida appointed Yanukovych's envoy to Crimea, Kyiv Post (28 February 2012) References Category:1956 births Category:Prime Ministers of Crimea Category:Ukrainian businesspeople Category:People from Krasnyi Luch Category:Living people Category:Presidential representatives of Ukraine in Crimea ","title":"Viktor Plakida"},{"id":"10959108","text":"The Unnatural Combat is a Jacobean era stage play, a tragedy written by Philip Massinger, and first published in 1639. No hard data on the play's date of origin or initial theatrical production has survived. Scholars estimate a date in the early 1620s; \\"There is a strong case for a late 1624 or early 1625 date for the play.\\"Claire Jowitt, \\"'I am Another Woman': The Spanish and French Matches in Massinger's The Renegado (1624) and The Unnatural Combat (1624‚Äì5),\\" in Samson, p. 168. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 February 1639, and published in quarto later that year by the bookseller John Waterson; the title page states that it was acted by the King's Men in the Globe Theatre. The quarto also bears Massinger's dedication of the play to a personal friend, Sir Anthony St. Leger (or \\"Sentleger\\"). In search of a source for Massinger's plot, critics have considered the story of Beatrice Cenci and a passage in Jonson's Catiline that refers to \\"incest, murders, rapes...incestuous life.\\"Edwards and Gibson, Vol. 2, p. 184. Yet it is clear from the thinness of these connections that the plot of the play is \\"Massinger's own.\\"Suzanne Gossett, \\"'Best Men are Molded out of Faults': Marrying the Rapist in Jacobean Drama,\\" in Kinney and Collins, p. 188. Scholars have studied The Unnatural Combat for resonances with the events of its era; it has been argued that the play's portrait of its villain Malefort Senior alludes to the sex scandals and witchcraft allegations surrounding George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.Jowitt in Samson, pp. 168‚Äì70. Also, in another possible anti-Buckingham thrust, the play may refer to the failed English expedition to Cadiz (1625); the dedicatee's brother, Sir William St. Leger, was instrumental in the expedition and was critical of Buckingham's conduct of it.Margot Heinemann, \\"Drama and opinion in the 1620s: Middleton and Massinger,\\" in Mulryne and Shewring, pp. 250‚Äì1. The play's theme of incest has prevented it from gaining any status as a popular or often-revived drama. Nineteenth-century critics tended to condemn The Unnatural Combat for its sensational aspect; but T. S. Eliot praised the play's \\"deft handling of suspense\\" and its \\"theatrical skill.\\"Eliot, \\"Philip Massinger,\\" in The Sacred Wood; p. 76. Synopsis The play tells the story of the intertwined fates of two families, the Beauforts and Maleforts. Beaufort Senior is the governor of Marseilles in France; his son, Beaufort Junior, is in love with, and beloved by, Theocrine, the daughter of Malefort Senior, the admiral of Marseilles. The admiral's son and Theocrine's half-brother, Malefort Junior, is a successful and notorious pirate; at the start of the play his pirate fleet is blockading the harbor of the city, and his father the admiral is suspected of collusion with the son's actions. This situation is delineated in the play's opening scene, which proceeds to the admiral's trial before the governor and other officials. Malefort Senior reminds his judges of his many past victories and acts of courage, though to little effect. The trial is then interrupted by an emissary from the pirates, who bears a challenge: Malefort Junior challenges his father to single combat, which will decide the outcome of the pirates' siege. Malefort Senior agrees; it is a way for him to clear his reputation and refute the charges against him‚Äîbut more than that, the challenge satisfies his bloody-minded nature. (This duel, of course, is the \\"unnatural combat\\" of the title.) Malefort Junior and his captains arrive for the duel. The pirates, talking among themselves, express their surprise at their leader's course of action; they do not comprehend his motives. When Malefort Senior and Junior meet, they converse before the fight ‚Äî and the son reproaches his father for having committed a \\"deed of horror\\" (though he doesn't specify the nature of that horrible action). They duel; the father kills the son, and mutilates his body. The pirates withdraw, according to their agreement; Malefort Senior is cleared of the charges against him and hailed once more as the city's hero. Plans are made for the wedding of Beaufort Junior and Theocrine; but their friends note the strange, doting, almost obsessive behavior that Malefort Senior has begun to show toward his daughter. A plan is hatched to distract the admiral at a banquet in his honor, and to take Theocrine aside for a quick marriage ceremony with her fianc√©. But Malefort Senior is too suspicious and watchful to be fooled in this way, and he discovers and forestalls the intended ceremony. In a soliloquy, Malefort divulges that he is suddenly plagued with, and almost overcome by, lustful and incestuous desire for his daughter. In his confusion and distress, he appeals to his cynical friend Montreville, the commander of the city's fortress. Malefort asks Montreville to take Theocrine into his custody, and has the man swear to keep them, father and daughter, separate, no matter how Malefort may change his mind, object, or plead to the contrary in the future. Montreville does as Malefort requests, but for his own dark motives; he abducts Theocrine and takes her to his fortress. When Malefort eventually, and inevitably, comes to the fortress to try to get her back, Montreville has her tossed out the front gate, her clothing disordered and hair disheveled; and Montreville cheerfully admits to having raped her. He reminds Malefort that he was once a rejected suitor for Theocrine's hand, and gloats over his revenge. Montreville also reveals the sinister history the two men share, and the nature of the crime with which Malefort Junior had reproached his father on the \\"field of honor.\\" Years before, Malefort had fallen in love with Montreville's mistress; to marry the woman, Malefort poisoned his first wife, his son's mother. Malefort then married the mistress, who gave birth to Theocrine. Theocrine dies from the shock of her rape.Similarly, Lucina dies from her rape in Fletcher's Valentinian. Malefort, in his distraction, sees the ghosts of his son and his murdered first wife.Massinger employs ghosts in two of his plays‚Äîthis, and The Roman Actor. A thunderstorm rises, and Malefort is struck by a bolt of lightning and killed on the spot. The forces of the governor, led by Beaufort Senior and Junior and other officials, assault and take the fortress; Montreville is led away to answer for his crime. The tragic plot is varied with some elements of comic relief, from two sources. One is a group of Theocrine's servants that includes her Usher, waiting women, and especially her Page; the other, and the more important one, is the figure of Belgarde, a cashiered captain who has to struggle for survival, cadging free meals wherever he can. Belgarde also supplies social commentary on the fates of soldiers and sailors who are no longer needed by society (relevant, perhaps, in the aftermath of the Cadiz campaign).

In 1990 he issued Short Fuse Blues which brought him to the attention of United States label, Alligator Records. Two of his albums have appeared on Billboard Top Blues Albums, Steel on Steel (1995) peaked at No. 13 and Ticket to Chicago (1997) reached No. 15\\\\. His sixth album, Under the Spell, appeared in April 1999 and won \\"Best Blues & Roots Album\\" at the ARIA Music Awards of that year. Hole is noted for his unusual performance style, which alternates traditionally plucked notes and chords with the slide notes played by his hand draped over the guitar's neck. According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, Hole \\"is the most acclaimed blues guitarist Australia has ever produced ... courtesy of his unorthodox slide guitar style, his rousing live shows and a series of hard-rocking, roadhouse blues albums ... yet it took two decades of slogging around the Australian touring circuit before the local industry sat up and took notice\\". Biography Robert David Hole was born on 30 March 1948 in Heswall, United Kingdom, due to a mix up at the hospital he was named Robert when it should have been David. The family called him David and now he goes by David Robert Hole. When he was four years old his family moved to Perth, Western Australia. He became interested in blues music after hearing a school friend's Muddy Waters' album when aged six. At twelve years old he received his first guitar and started to teach himself due to lack of availability of teachers. He used the albums of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Blind Willie Johnson, Skip James, Blind Lemon Jefferson to learn. He later used work of Robert Johnson, Elmore James, and Mississippi Fred McDowell. Hole is left-handed and, after breaking a finger in a football accident, he played the guitar right-handed. \\"I had to have a cast on it. So I came up with this idea, just while I was recuperating, of jamming the slide on my index finger and hanging it over the top of the guitar ‚Äì quite an awkward sort of style, really. It took me about three months before this cast came off. And over that time it started to feel good\\". In 1965 Hole formed his first group, Broken Habits, which included Daryl Upson on bass guitar. The following year he created the earliest version of Dave Hole Band with Upson, Denis Crake on vocals and Jim Morris on drums. In 1968 Hole joined The Beat 'n Tracks, a pop, blues, R&B; band formed in early 1967 with Ace Follington on drums, Warren Morgan on keyboards and vocals, Ross Partington on lead vocals and Murray Wilkins on bass guitar. They played covers of The Beatles, Paul Butterfield, Motown and Vanilla Fudge material. The group won the 1968 Perth heat of the national Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds and travelled to Melbourne for the final. They also toured the eastern states before Hole returned to Perth late that year to continue his university studies. He was replaced by Phil Manning (ex-Bay City Union, Laurie Allen Revue) on guitar and lead vocals ‚Äì The Beat 'n Tracks evolved into Chain. In 1972 Hole formed Dave Hole Blues Band with Upson and Al Kash on drums (ex-Blackfeather), the trio relocated to London and played in local pubs. Hole returned to Perth in 1974, from that time for twenty years, he toured the Western Australian pub circuit with differing line-ups of Dave Hole Band. By 1977 with Hole were Phil Bailey on bass guitar and Ian Ironside on drums. They provided two tracks, \\"Country Town\\" and \\"Still in Love with You\\", for a various artists compilation, The 6WF Rock Group Album which appeared in 1979. Also that year Hole joined with Matt Taylor (ex-Bay City Union, Chain, Western Flyer) on lead vocals and harmonica to form Matt Taylor Band featuring Dave Hole, they were backed by Paul Pooley on bass guitar (Manteca) and Ric Whittle on drums (Fatty Lumpkin, Manteca). They toured Australia \\"playing some of the most electrifying blues rock ever heard in this country\\". By late 1980 the group dissolved without recording any material. During the 1980s Dave Hole Band continued with various line-ups until 1988, when he established Short Fuse with John Wilson on bass guitar and Ronnie Parker on drums. In 1990 they released an album, Short Fuse Blues, which Hole had financed, produced, and recorded in three days. Bob Patient (ex-Matt Taylor's Chain) guested on keyboards and joined to tour in support of the work. Rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, observed that it is \\"full of Hole's sinuous, hot-wired guitar work, which evoked the spirit of Elmore James and Blind Willie Johnson\\". Hole sent a copy to United States magazine, Guitar Player, its editor, Jas Obrecht, wrote an article in July 1991 praising Hole as the newest guitar wizard and comparing him with Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King. Soon a copy of the album was in the hands of Alligator Records president Bruce Iglauer who signed Hole up as the first non-US-based artist of their 26-year history. In November 1992 Guitar Players critics, Art Thompson and Chris Gill, praised him ‚Äì and fellow slide guitarists Sonny Landreth and Dave Tronzo ‚Äì as \\"visionary\\" with a \\"distinctive technique\\" that \\"redefine[s] the art\\". While new fans were gained via radio play on more than 1000 stations. Reviews appeared in Guitar for the Practicing Musician, Billboard, Audio, Spin, The Chicago Tribune, The Denver Post and Associated Press. Hole signed a deal for the European market with Provogue Records, with albums and tours of the US and Europe helping increase his popularity further. Later tours of Europe have seen him headlining festival shows in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland with the Leverkusen Blues Festival in Germany televised nationally. He has also performed in Brazil, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Austria, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the UK. Two of his albums have appeared on Billboard Top Blues Albums chart, Steel on Steel (1995) peaked at No. 13 and Ticket to Chicago (1997) reached No. 15. In August 1997 Hole commenced his third tour of US blues festivals and displayed his \\"unique slide playing style which involves using his index finger rather than his pinkie\\". On 20 April 1999 he issued Under the Spell, which won \\"Best Blues & Roots Album\\" at the ARIA Music Awards of that year. McFarlane noted that he \\"is the most acclaimed blues guitarist Australia has ever produced ... courtesy of his unorthodox slide guitar style, his rousing live shows and a series of hard- rocking, roadhouse blues albums ... yet it took two decades of slogging around the Australian touring circuit before the local industry sat up and took notice\\". Although under-appreciated in Australia Hole was described by Robert Messenger in The Canberra Times as \\"a musical genius\\" and \\"in the US he is living blues legend\\". In August 2004 Hole was interviewed by Brendan Hutchens for ABC's George Negus Tonight and recalled \\"It's very, very raw emotional music. And it communicates very strongly and it did to me. When I first heard blues, it bowled me over. And it's great. I love it. I love to be able to communicate with people through that, through the music\\". On 19 May 2007 Hole issued his tenth album, Rough Diamond, which Sing Out!s Gary von Tersch compared with Muddy Waters and Duane Allman as \\"spirited\\" and showed \\"incendiary blues and rock slide guitar\\". As well as releasing ten albums, Hole has continued to tour worldwide for six months each year, returning to his home in the Darling Scarp of Western Australia for the other six months.

She was the first American recipient of the Legion of Merit Career Ann Bernatitus was appointed as Ensign in the Navy Nurse Corps in 1936, after graduating from the Wyoming Valley Homeopathic Hospital Training School in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1934, and the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate Hospital post-graduate program in operating room nursing in 1935. Bernatitus's first assignments with the Navy were as a staff nurse at the Naval Hospitals in Chelsea, Massachusetts and Annapolis, Maryland. In 1940, she was assigned duty on board the before assignment to the US Naval Hospital at Canacao, Philippines Islands in July 1940. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and start of the Japanese war in the Pacific, Canacoa Hospital staff and patients were evacuated to Manila and Bataan under US Army supervision. As the lone Navy nurse on her team, Bernatitus treated American, Filipino, and Japanese wounded from the Japanese siege between December and April. In October 1942, she became the first American recipient of the Legion of Merit for her heroism during the siege of Bataan and Corregidor from December 1941 through April 1942. She was among the last group of the \\"Angels of Bataan\\" to be evacuated from the Philippines just prior to the fall of Corregidor aboard and was the only Navy nurse stationed there to evade capture. She served at Bethesda Naval Hospital, New Orleans, Naval Hospital Great Lakes, and San Francisco, then in 1945, as Chief of Nursing Service aboard the hospital ship during the Okinawa campaign.

Bernatitus (NSN: 64916W) United States Navy :For exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as a member of Surgical Unit No. 5 during the Japanese attack on the Philippines, December 1941 through April 1942. Nurse Bernatitus maintained her position in the front lines of the Manila-Bataan area rendering efficient and devoted service during the prolonged siege. Miss Bernatitus was regularly attached to the Naval Hospital, Canacao, Philippine Islands having reported for duty there on 20 July 1941. Shortly after hostilities commenced in December 1941 the Naval Hospital Staff and patients were moved to a new establishment in Manila. On 24 December 1941, when Manila was being evacuated Miss Bernatitus accompanied by two Navy Medical Officers proceeded to the Army Hospital at Limay, Bataan. The remainder of the hospital staff stayed in Manila and were taken prisoners. On 25 January 1942, Miss Bernatitus was transferred to Army Field Hospital No. 1 at Little Baguio, Bataan and remained there on active duty until that hospital was destroyed by enemy bombing on 7 April. When Bataan fell Miss Bernatitus was transferred to Corregidor. During her stay in Bataan she worked directly under Lieutenant Commander C. M. Smith (MC), USN, who is now a prisoner of war. The conditions under which the nurses lived and worked lacked everything in the way of comfort. They were constantly exposed to enemy bombing attacks and experienced several as well as the endemic jungle diseases of that area. Miss Bernatitus suffered from both dysentery and beriberi during her tour of duty in Bataan. In spite of all difficulties Miss Bernatitus performed her duty in an exemplary manner with courage and good spirit. She was officially transferred from Corregidor three days before the surrender of that fortress. (Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bernatitus is authorized to wear the Combat \\"V\\".)

Zola's plan for the Rougon-Macquart novels was to show how heredity and environment worked on the members of one family over the course of the Second Empire. He wraps up his heredity theories in this novel. Le docteur Pascal is furthermore essentially a story about science versus faith. The novel begins in 1872, after the fall of the Second Empire and the end of the reign of Emperor Napoleon III. The title character, Pascal Rougon (b. 1813), is the son of Pierre and F√©licit√© Rougon, whose rise to power in the fictional town of Plassans is detailed in the first novel of the series La fortune des Rougon. Plot summary Pascal, a physician in Plassans for 30 years, has spent his life cataloging and chronicling the lives of his family based on his theories of heredity. Pascal believes that everyone's physical and mental health and development can be classified based on the interplay between innateness (reproduction of characteristics based in difference) and heredity (reproduction based in similarity). Using his own family as a case study, Pascal classifies the 30 descendants of his grandmother Adela√Øde Fouque (Tante Dide) based on this model. Pascal has developed a serum he hopes will cure hereditary and nervous diseases (including consumption) and improve if not prolong life. His niece Clotilde sees Pascal's work as denying the omnipotence of God and as a prideful attempt to comprehend the unknowable. She encourages him to destroy his work, but he refuses. (Like other members of the family, Pascal is somewhat obsessive in the pursuit of his passion.) Pascal's explains his goal as a scientist as laying the groundwork for happiness and peace by seeking and uncovering the truth, which he believes lies in the science of heredity. After he shows her the Rougon-Macquart family tree and demonstrates his refusal to sugarcoat the family's acts, Clotilde begins to agree with him. Her love for him solidifies her faith in his theories and his lifelong work. Clotilde and Pascal eventually begin a romance, much to the chagrin of his mother F√©licit√©. (She is less concerned about the incestuous nature of the relationship than by the fact that the two are living together out of wedlock.) F√©licit√© wants to keep the family secrets buried at any cost, including several family skeletons living nearby: her alcoholic brother-in-law Antoine Macquart and her centenarian mother-in-law Tante Dide. When Clotilde's brother Maxime asks Clotilde to come to Paris, F√©licit√© sees this as an opportunity to control Pascal and access his papers to destroy them. Pascal suffers a series of heart attacks, and Clotilde is not able to return from Paris before he dies. F√©licit√© immediately burns all of Pascal's scholarly work and the documents she considers incriminating. The novel, and the entire 20-novel series, concludes with the birth of Pascal and Clotilde's son and the hope placed on him for the future of the family. Relation to the other Rougon-Macquart novels Modified family tree for the Rougon-Macquart. This is the last tree drawn by Zola. It is part of the preparation work for the novel Le Docteur Pascal. Note that it contains \\"l'enfant inconnu\\" (\\"the unknown child\\"), the last child of the family, born from Clotilde and Pascal (after his death). As the last novel in the series, Le docteur Pascal ties up the loose ends of the remaining family members' lives. It is the only Rougon- Macquart novel that has all five generations of the family represented. Furthermore, it is the only novel in which a representative from each of the five generations dies: Tante Dide, Antoine Macquart, Pascal Rougon, Maxime Rougon/Saccard, and his son Charles. Adela√Øde Fouque (Tante Dide), the family ancestress, has lived in an asylum for 21 years. She dies at the age of 105 after witnessing the death of her great-great-grandson Charles. Her eldest son Pierre Rougon, F√©licit√©'s husband, died two years before the novel opens. Her younger son Antoine Macquart is a drunk. He dies during the course of the novel when his body, soaked with alcohol from a lifetime of drinking, catches fire - a fictional instance of spontaneous human combustion that may be compared to the death of Krook in Bleak House. Here again Zola touches, in a horrific manner, on the consequences of the excessive consumption of alcohol, a theme common to the entire Rougon-Macquart cycle. Clotilde's brother Maxime lives in a Parisian mansion; he is suffering from ataxia and is being preyed upon by his father Aristide Saccard (see L'argent), who wants to get his hands on Maxime's money. Maxime has an illegitimate son named Charles, a hemophiliac, who bleeds to death on an afternoon visit to Tante Dide. Maxime too dies in the last pages of the novel. In addition, we learn about the following: * Eug√®ne Rougon, Pascal's elder brother, is a deputy in the legislature where he continues to defend the fallen Emperor. * Aristide Saccard, Pascal's younger brother, exiled to Belgium after the fall of the Banque Universelle (see L'argent), has returned to France. He is editor of a newspaper and is again building new and great businesses. After Maxime dies, he pockets his fortune for his own ends. * Victor, Aristide's illegitimate son, has disappeared into the streets of Paris and left no trace (see L'argent). * Sidonie Rougon, Pascal's sister, after a life of impropriety, now lives in \\"nunlike austerity\\" as the financial mistress of a home for unwed mothers. * Octave Mouret and his wife Denise (Au bonheur des dames) have three children, a newborn, a sickly daughter and a robust and healthy son. * Serge Mouret (La faute de l'Abb√© Mouret), a parish priest, lives in religious seclusion with his sister Desir√©e. At the end of Le docteur Pascal, his death is imminent. * H√©l√®ne Mouret and her husband Rambaud (Une page d'amour) continue to live in Marseilles, childless. * Pauline Quenu (La joie de vivre) still lives at Bonneville, raising Lazare's son Paul (her uncle Chanteau having died) while Lazare, now a widower, has gone to America. * √âtienne Lantier (Germinal) was arrested for taking part in the violence of the Paris Commune and sent to New Caledonia, where he is married and has a child. * Jean Macquart (La terre, La d√©b√¢cle) has married and lives in a town near Plassans. He and his wife have two vital and healthy children, and they are expecting a third at the close of the series. The hope for any enduring strength of the family lies here, as with Clotilde and Pascal's son. Publication and translation The novel was translated into English by Ernest A.

Important in regional history since pre-colonial times, the island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark District. Geography Long Island is located across the main channel of the South Branch Holston River from downtown Kingsport. It is about in length, and has a maximum width of about . A secondary channel, known locally as the Sluice, forms the southern border of the island. Bridges carry Tennessee State Route 126 across both channels about 2/3 of the way south on the island, and a third bridge carries Jared Drive to the mainland near its southern tip. The area south of SR 126 is mostly occupied by Eastman Chemical. History Historic plaque The Long Island of the Holston River was an important site for the Cherokee, colonial pioneers, and early settlers of the region. It was a sacred council and treaty site among the Cherokee people. The Timberlake Expedition of 1761‚Äì62 used it as its point of origin and return. It was from here that Daniel Boone, in 1775, began to clear the Wilderness Road, which extended through the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky. William Cocke, who had worked with Boone and led fights against the Cherokee, sold the island in 1776 to Samuel Woods but without a right to do so. The 1777 Long Island of the Holston Treaty stated that the Cherokee still owned the land. Thomas Dearborn, Secretary of State to Thomas Jefferson, purchased the island from the Cherokee on January 7, 1806. Richard Netherland, husband of one of Woods' descendants, bought the land from Woods' relatives who succeeded in getting the land back in 1810. He built a plantation and began industries. A long-standing settlement built at the site was chartered as the town of Kingsport in 1822 and became an important regional shipping port on the Holston River in the early 19th century. Goods brought in from the surrounding countryside were loaded onto barges for transport downstream to the Holston's confluence with the Tennessee River (at Knoxville). The young town lost its charter, however, after a downturn in its fortunes precipitated by the Civil War. During Prohibition, the island gained a reputation for violence and bootlegging. Long Island of the Holston was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. and (32 KB) 3.61 acres described as \\"Sacred Cherokee ground\\" obtained in 1806 were returned to the Eastern Band of the Cherokee July 16, 1976. The island, however, has been heavily transformed by industrial development, particularly Eastman Chemical Company. National Park Service staff recommended withdrawal of the National Historic Landmark status in 1996 because of a loss of the island's historic integrity, but the island has retained its Historic Landmark status. Demographics Most of the island lies within the corporate boundaries of Kingsport. Long Island's population peaked between 1955 and 1963, holding 517 residences and approximately 1,800 people at the time. There are only a handful of houses on the island as of 2019.

The first German national film archive, it was opened in 1935, and based in Berlin. It ceased to exist in 1945, when its film stock was either destroyed or seized by the Soviet army.  History  The Reichsfilmarchiv was opened on 4 February 1935 in Harnack House, Dahlem, Berlin, in the presence of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels, with an enormous flurry of propaganda. It soon gained a high international reputation. When the F√©d√©ration Internationale des Archives du Film (FIAF) was established as an international joint film archive in Paris in 1938, the Reichsfilmarchiv was one of the four founding members. The Independent State of Croatia kept copies of its films at the archive, due to the lack of a sufficient archive of its own.Kinematografija u NDH After their arrival in Berlin in April 1945, Soviet troops seized the Reichsfilmarchiv and took possession of all its surviving film material. In 1947 its place was filled in West Germany by the Archiv f√ºr Filmwissenschaft (\\"Archive of Film Science\\"), set up in Marburg by Hanns Wilhelm Lavies, while in East Germany it was succeeded by the Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR (\\"State Film Archive of the DDR\\"), established in 1955.  Collections  At the time of its opening the film archive already held more than 1,200 films, some transferred from their previous place of deposit in the Reichsarchiv Potsdam (\\"Imperial Archives, Potsdam\\"), others provided by the film industry. By the end of the war in 1945, not only through the normal channels of acquisition, but also very largely through seizure and confiscation in the occupied territories, the collection had grown to 17,352 films. After the end of the war most of these films, many of which had been stored in the bell tower of the Berlin Olympic Stadium, were lost. 6,400 selected films eventually found their way into the Soviet film archive in Krasnogorsk near Moscow and from there into Soviet cinemas, where some of them were still showing up to 1956. When in 1955 the State Film Archive of the DDR was founded, it was permitted to take over a proportion of the collection.

NParks is responsible for enhancing and managing the urban ecosystems of which the government calls a \\"City in Nature\\". NParks is the lead agency for greenery, biodiversity conservation, and wildlife and animal health, welfare and management. They are also working closely with the community to enhance the quality of their living environment. NParks manages more than over 350 parks and 3,347 hectares of nature reserves, the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Jurong Lake Gardens, Pulau Ubin and the Sisters' Islands Marine Park. Adding to this is the extensive network of Nature Ways, and the over 300km Park Connector Network that links major parks, nature areas and residential estates island-wide. Every year, they run over 3,500 educational and outreach programmes across the various green spaces. NParks has developed an urban biodiversity conservation model, which aims to conserve representative ecosystems in land-scarce Singapore. NParks also monitors and coordinates measures to enhance the presence of biodiversity in Singapore‚Äôs urban landscape. NParks is working closely with partners in the landscape, horticulture, veterinary and animal sectors to increase productivity, and provide training for all levels of the workforce. Enhancing competencies of the industry will support Singapore‚Äôs vision of being a City in Nature.  History  The history of NParks is closely interlinked with the history of tree-planting in Singapore.Trees of Singapore In the 1960s, when the Singapore government embarked on nation building, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then Prime Minister, was intent on transforming Singapore into a Garden City. Beginning with the first Tree Planting Campaign in 1963, the government embarked on an initiative to green up the island. This initiative was carried through into the 1970s and 1980s under the Parks and Recreation Department (PRD). On 1 July 1996, PRD was renamed the National Parks Board. Since then, NParks‚Äô mission has gradually evolved from realising a vision for a Garden City to creating a City in a Garden.Tale of a Magical Seed Since 1 April 2019, all non-food plant and animal-related functions originally under the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore were transferred to NParks under Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) as part of a reorganisation.  The City in a Garden framework  To introduce the City in a Garden (CIAG) vision and framework, NParks launched a public engagement exercise in August 2011 to encourage all Singaporeans to contribute their views. The agency identified six key areas, which form the framework for creating a City in a Garden, and Singaporeans were invited to build on these ideas or contribute new ones to co-create a greener, more endearing home. The six key areas include ‚Äúestablish world-class gardens‚Äù, ‚Äúrejuvenate urban parks and enliven our streetscape‚Äù, ‚Äúoptimise urban spaces and infrastructure for greenery and recreation‚Äù, ‚Äúenrich biodiversity in our urban environment‚Äù, ‚Äúenhance competencies of our landscape and horticulture industry‚Äù and ‚Äúengage and inspire communities to co-create a greener Singapore‚Äù.

An example of this process is where the anteroposterior axis (the axis drawn between the head and tail end of an embryo) becomes longer as the lateral tissues (those that make up the left and right sides of the embryo) move in towards the dorsal midline (the middle of the back of the animal). This process plays a crucial role in shaping the body plan during embryogenesis and occurs during gastrulation, neurulation, axis elongation, and organogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate embryos. In chordate animals, this process is utilized within a vast population of cells; from the smaller populations in the notochord of the sea squirt (ascidian) to the larger populations of the dorsal mesoderm and neural ectoderm of frogs (Xenopus) and fish. Many characteristics of convergent extension are conserved in the teleost fish, the bird, and very likely within mammals at the molecular, cellular, and tissue level. Figure 1. Morphogenic Movements (Adapted from ) Convergent extension has been primarily studied in frogs and fish due to their large embryo size and their development outside of a maternal host (in egg clutches in the water, as opposed to in a uterus). Within frogs and fish, however, there exist fundamental differences in how convergent extension is achieved. Frog embryogenesis utilizes cell rearrangement as the sole player of this process. Fish, on the other hand, utilize both cell rearrangement as well as directed migration (Fig. 1) . Cellular rearrangement is the process by which individual cells of a tissue rearrange to reshape the tissue as a whole, while cellular migration is the directed movement of a singular cell or small group of cells across a substrate such as a membrane or tissue. Frog (Xenopus), as well as other amphibian, gastrulation serves as an excellent example of the role of convergent extension in embryogenesis. During gastrulation in frogs, the driving force of convergent extension is the morphogenic activity of the presumptive dorsal mesodermal cells; this activity is driven by the mesenchymal cells that lie beneath the presumptive mesodermal and neural tissues. These tissues exist within the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) of the embryo which lies between the vegetal endoderm and the posterior neural tissue. The IMZ is integral to gastrulation and R. Keller et al. eloquently exemplify the importance of convergent extension in Xenopus gastrulation. ‚Äú‚Ä¶the IMZ, true to its name, involutes or rolls over the blastoporal lip and turns inside out. As it involutes, it converges along the mediolateral axis and extends along the future anterior-posterior axis of the notochordal and somitic mesoderm. Convergence and extension of these tissues squeezes the blastopore shut and simultaneously elongate the body axis. Elongation continues through the neurula and tailbud stages‚Ä¶As these involuted dorsal mesodermal tissues converge and extend on the inside of the gastrula, the presumptive posterior neural tissue converges and extends on the outside of the embryo, parallel to the underlying mesoderm, and then rolls up to form the neural tube, which later forms the hindbrain and spinal cord of the central nervous system\\". Should convergent extension be interrupted or incomplete, the resulting organism will have a short anteroposterior axis, wide notochord, and broad, open neural tube. The cellular signals required for convergent extension are not fully understood, however, it is known that the non- canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role,. Current research is shedding light on the cellular mechanisms of convergent extension and recently the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway was implicated in regulating the cell polarity of the factors involved in convergent extension. This is an interesting development as the PCP pathway is an integral and well-studied pathway in flies, but has classically been thought to be unemployed by vertebrates. In addition to the non-canonical Wnt and PCP pathways involvement in convergent extension, the down-regulation of certain cell-cell adhesion molecules, such as C-cadherin and fibronectin/integrin interactions, may also play a role. Reduction of the activity of these cell-cell adhesion molecules allows for cells undergoing convergent extension to move more freely. Consistent with a role for a reduction of cell-cell adhesion in convergent extension, when cell-cell adhesion is not reduced, convergent extension cannot occur.

Ortiz (born May 27, 1941) is a Puebloan writer of the Acoma Pueblo tribe, and one of the key figures in the second wave of what has been called the Native American Renaissance. He is one of the most respected and widely read Native American poets. Ortiz's commitment to preserving and expanding the literary and oral traditions of the Acoma accounts for many of the themes and techniques that compose his work. Ortiz identifies himself less as a \\"poet\\" than a \\"storyteller\\". The composition of a traditional Pueblo storyteller includes not only oral narrative materials, which adapt easily to short story or essay forms, but also songs, chants, winter stories, sacred oral narratives associated with origin stories and their attendant ceremonies. Such materials when recited aloud, have a distinctly \\"poetic\\" texture. Background Ortiz is a member of the Eagle Clan. He was raised in the Acoma village of McCartys (the Keresan name is \\"Deetzeyaamah\\"), and spoke only Keresan at home. His father, a railroad worker and woodcarver, was an elder in the clan who was charged with keeping the religious knowledge and customs of the pueblo. Ortiz attended McCartys Day School through the sixth grade, after which he was sent to St. Catherine's Indian School in Santa Fe, as most Native children were sent to Indian boarding schools at the time. Attempting to provide an English language education, such boarding schools sought to assimilate Native American children into \\"American\\" mainstream culture, and strictly forbade them to speak their own native languages. Thus, the young Ortiz began to struggle with an acute awareness of the cultural dissonance shaping him and began to write about his experiences and thoughts in his diaries and compose short stories. While frustrated with his situation, he became a voracious reader and developed a passionate love of language, reading whatever he could get his hands on ‚Äî including dictionaries, which he felt let his mind travel within a \\"state of wonder.\\" Homesick for his family and community, Ortiz became disillusioned with St. Catherine's. He transferred to Albuquerque Indian School, which taught trade classes such as plumbing and mechanics. He took both metal and woodworking classes, but his father was opposed to the prospect of his son's future being in manual labor. However, the day after graduating from Grants High School (in Grants, New Mexico near Acoma) Ortiz began work as a laborer at Kerr-McGee, a uranium plant. Interested in becoming a chemist, he initially applied for a technical position. Instead, he was made a typist, soon demoted to being a crusher, and later promoted as a semi-skilled operator. His experience as a mining laborer would later inspire his work, \\"Fight Back: For the Sake of the People, for the Sake of the Land.\\" Ortiz eventually saved enough money to enroll in Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado, as a chemistry major with the help of a BIA educational grant. While enthralled with language and literature, the young Ortiz never considered pursuing writing seriously; at the time, it was not a career that seemed viable for Native people; it was \\"a profession only whites did.\\" Literary career After spending three years in the U.S. Armed Forces, Ortiz initiated his literary career when he began to attend the University of New Mexico in 1966 with the intent to study English Literature and creative writing. Ortiz soon discovered, through his studies, that few ethnic writers have entered the canon of American Literature. Due to his interest in the subject of ethnic writers, Ortiz discovered a new age of Native American authors arising during a renaissance of political activism. One of Ortiz's influences was Kiowa author, N. Scott Momaday. Momaday's novel House Made of Dawn (1968) expresses an original form of prose and innovative style that attracted a young Ortiz. The combination of both the political atmosphere surrounding Native cultures and the lack of ethnic authors integrated in the literary curriculum also caused Ortiz to alter his writing style from self-expression to a focus on unheard Native voices. In 1968, Ortiz was offered a fellowship for writing at the University of Iowa in the International Writers Program. Ortiz's first collection of poems, Going for the Rain, was published in 1976. His publication was inspired by the stories of Indigenous people across the country. Ortiz set out on a cross-country trip in 1970 to uncover original stories from the Native perspective. Ortiz has since furthered his literary career with a multitude of publications including poetry, short-stories, and books. From then on, Ortiz was considered one of the most respected and widely read Native American poets. Ortiz relates his style to the struggles of those living within the Southwest stemming from destructive Western expansionism, including the railroads his father worked on, land developers and uranium exploitation, which Ortiz himself worked within. These struggles and the exploitation of the land are inherent within Ortiz' poetry and his writing style as a whole. In 1976, Ortiz enrolled in Evergreen State College's Independent Studies Program to conduct research regarding health hazards for people living near open-pit mines and mill-tailings ponds. In 1988 Ortiz was appointed as tribal interpreter of the Acoma Pueblo. He also held a position as the consulting editor of the Pueblo of Acoma Press, in 1982. Academic career Since 1968, Ortiz has taught creative writing and Native American literature at various institutions, including San Diego State, the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, Navajo Community College, the College of Marin, the University of New Mexico, Sinte Gleska University, and the University of Toronto. He currently teaches at Arizona State University. Awards and honors Ortiz is a recipient of the New Mexico Humanities Council Humanitarian Award, the National Endowment for the Arts Discovery Award, the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Writer's Award, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and was an Honored Poet recognized at the 1981 White House Salute to Poetry. In 1981, From Sand Creek: Rising In This Heart Which Is Our America, received the Pushcart Prize in poetry.

He was noted as having a quiet and jovial disposition which suited his profession as a barman. In 1984 Fleming spent a week in Hydebank Detention Centre in Belfast after he refused to pay a fine he was given after being found guilty of damaging a Royal Ulster Constabulary vehicle. William Fleming was a cousin of Ciaran Fleming. They died within four days of each other, both while with Active Service Units. His sister Lynn Fleming is a Sinn F√©in representative for the Waterside area. Paramilitary activities Fleming became a member of Na Fianna √âireann during his early teens and later joined the IRA when he turned 17. On 6 December 1984, Fleming and Doherty were riding around on a motorbike in the grounds of Gransha Hospital, approximately four miles from Derry city centre. The hospital was also the administrative headquarters of the Western Health and Social Services Board. It was reported at the time that the pair had gone to the hospital in an attempt to assassinate an off-duty member of the Ulster Defence Regiment who was employed there, and had intended to carry it out during a staff shift change at 8 a.m.. The SAS were aware that an IRA operation had been planned to take place in the vicinity of the hospital after receiving a tip-off from an intelligence source. An SAS unit from the Londonderry Detachment of 14 Intelligence Company, without the knowledge of the Royal Ulster Constabulary or the hospital authorities, located troops at the site keeping watch for two weeks prior to 6 December. However, they had minimal prior information as to how the attack was to be executed and when.Big Boys Rules ‚Äì The SAS and the secret struggle against the IRA, Mark Urban, Faber and Faber 1993. PB) p.194-5 At 8 a.m., Fleming and Doherty were spotted on the motorbike by the SAS sentries who were located within an unmarked car, which proceeded to ram it, dislodging Fleming from the pillion seat and causing the motorcycle to go out of control. Fleming was then approached by Judgment: approved by the Court two other SAS troopers who opened fire and killed him, claiming subsequently that he was armed and they considered him a direct threat. The motorcycle meanwhile had struck a kerb and thrown Doherty to the ground, where he was opened fire upon by the British Army soldiers and also killed. Subsequent forensic evidence showed that six bullets struck Doherty whilst he was on the ground, and Fleming's autopsy showed that he had four gunshot wounds to his head and 56 to his trunk and torso. During the inquest into the shootings, the coroner stated that Doherty had three gunshot wounds to the head and a further twenty one shots to his body. Reactions to the killings Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter Barry, stated that \\"in Northern Ireland, under British rule, it was the army who set the ambush ‚Äì it was an ambush, nothing else. No attempt to arrest was made. The men were shot dead without any chance to surrender.\\" Bishop Edward Daly rhetorically asked \\"do members of the Army have the right to use more force than appears necessary?\\" Gregory Campbell, Democratic Unionist Party spokesman, said \\"I am delighted that the two IRA men were intercepted and executed by the undercover army unit. The only way the IRA will be dealt with is when they are executed. They deal in death and must be dealt with in death.\\" John Hume then Social Democratic and Labour Party leader told the House of Commons, \\"This raises very fundamental questions as to whether the authorities have abandoned the rule of law, and whether we are now in a war situation.\\" Funeral Fleming's funeral procession departed from the Waterside and combined with the procession of Danny Doherty, which came from the Creggan estate on the south west side of the city. The funeral was the largest in Derry City since the death of hunger striker Patsy O'Hara. Both coffins had been dressed in the customary fashion with Irish tricolours and a colour party of IRA volunteers fired volleys of shots over the coffins. In excess of 3,000 mourners followed the funeral procession to the City Cemetery in Derry where Sinn F√©in's Martin McGuinness gave the graveside oration, and stated: '\\"We are an occupied country and those brave enough to fight repression deserve nothing but respect and unfailing support from us all. Only the IRA can bring Britain to the negotiating table.\\" Judicial review of SAS soldiers' prosecution In November 2004, the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland decided not to prosecute three of the SAS soldiers involved in the killing of Fleming and Doherty. Julie Doherty, the widow of Danny Doherty, submitted an application for a judicial review to be held into the killing of her husband and Fleming. This application was dismissed by Mr Justice Girvan. In his reserved judgement, Girvan said the decision not to prosecute could not be challenged as it was based on the prosecutor's assessment of the evidence. In addition, Girvan stated \\"The no prosecution decision was made in 1986. In 2004 it is much too late for the applicant to seek effectively to re-open a decision made in 1986 and not challenged within a reasonable time thereafter.\\" Though the application for the judicial review failed, the jury at Doherty's inquest did criticise the five-man army unit for not attempting to arrest him or inform the RUC of the operation earlier, through which they suggested his life might have been saved.

Opened on June 1, 1971, it is long, with a difference in elevation of as much as . The Alpine Route goes through Tateyama in the Hida Mountains with many scenic sites as well as walking trails, including Japan's largest dam, Kurobe Dam. Some stations have hotels around them and are used as bases for mountain climbing or trekking. From the top of the mountain, it is possible to see Mount Fuji on a fine day. Overview The route is composed of seven different transportation services using five different modes, namely funicular, bus, trolleybus, aerial tramway, and walking, and built so that the surrounding environment is not damaged. Three lines go through tunnels (to protect them from snow), including one funicular railway and two bus lines - one using trolleybuses (the last in Japan), and another using all-electric buses (trolleybuses until 2018), because they do not exhaust fumes in the tunnels. During summer, shuttle buses between Toyama and Murod≈ç are also available. The operates most lines in the route. Its official abbreviation is TKK.

From the highest to the lowest, these sights include the following. Located by Oyama peak is Oyama Shrine, where climbers can receive a blessing and warm sake from a priest. There is also a rest area where climbers may buy food, drinks, and souvenirs. This peak is better known but it is some way from the highest point of the mountain (Onanjiyama). Located on Murodo Plateau from Murod≈ç Station is a shopping area and onsen bath. The onsen on Tateyama is famously known for its use of sulfur spring water for the bath, leaving a noticeable aroma that can be detected even while ascending the mountain. Visitors can also find several hiking and walking paths that take them through the beautiful valleys, and take a look at Devil's Valley (Jigokudani). With many volcanic areas in Japan by the same name, visitors are no longer able to walk within the sulfur valley due to gas-related safety concerns. From April 15 to mid-June, one can enjoy the sparkling snow walls named Yukino-≈çtani, which tower anywhere from 15 to 20 meters high (roughly 50 to 65 feet). They flank the road leading to Murodo Station, where visitors can enjoy hot, delicious food after walking between the impressive, but chilly, snow walls. There are many charter services from Taipei, Inchon and Thailand during the high season to reach Murodo at this time. From Murodo, visitors can also reach Kurobe Dam, which stands at 186 meters (610 feet), making it the tallest dam in Japan. From Murod≈ç Station, visitors should take the Tateyama Tunnel Trolleybus (10 minutes), followed by the Tateyama Ropeway (7 minutes), and finally the Kurobe Cable Car (5 minutes). From the last stop, a 15-minute walk will take visitors to the dam. Midagahara is a flat walking area filled with flowing plains interrupted by blue ponds. Near the bus stop that returns visitors to Bijodaira back down the mountain is a slightly hidden walking path. Midagahara is accessible from Tateyama Station via the Tateyama Cable Car (7 minutes) followed by Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route bus (about 40 minutes) that goes in the direction of Murod≈ç Station. On clear days, climbers can see Sh≈çmy≈ç Falls (the tallest waterfall in Japan) across the valley while traveling along the main road from Tateyama Station to the Murodo Plateau. For a closer look, visitors can take a bus from Tateyama Station to the Sh≈çmy≈ç Falls stop (about 20 minutes). From there, visitors can walk to the falls up a steady slope (about 20 minutes). There is a large bridge as well as two viewing platforms to get views of the Falls. The section between Kurobe Dam and ≈ågisawa was originally made for construction of the dam, while the section between Tateyama and Kurobeko was for tourists from the beginning. Currently, the route is purely a sightseeing one, only used by tourists. Although this is the only route that directly links Toyama and Nagano, it is impractical for normal users as it takes 6 transfers, roughly 5 hours.

The Polish National Alliance (pol. ZwiƒÖzek Narodowy Polski, PNA) is the largest and one of the oldest Polish fraternal organizations in the United States. The original goal was to mobilize support among Polish Americans for the liberation of Poland. For much of the 20th century, it was locked in battle with the rival organization Polish Roman Catholic Union of America. It later emphasized fraternal roles such as social activities for its membership. By the 1980s it focused on its insurance program, with 300,000 members and assets of over $176 million.Pienkos, 1984 History The Polish National Alliance was founded on February 15, 1880 in Philadelphia under the influence of Polish patriot Agaton Giller. Its first president was Juliusz Andrzejkowicz. In 1886, the PNA inaugurated the first fraternal insurance program kind in the Polish-American community; by 2000 PNA members held over $800 million of insurance coverage. In 1891, the PNA organized the first Polish Constitution Day parade in Chicago, to generate interest in Polish independence; it has been held annually in Chicago since 1894. The PNA founded a number of publishing and educational institutions. From 1912 to 1991 it owned Alliance College in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania. The organization founded the Polish Library in Chicago and Immigrants House in New York. In 1910 it built the monument of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko in Washington, D.C.. One prominent alumnus of the PNA is the humanitarian physician Leon S. Talaska, M.D. The sense of Polish nationalism was so strong among certain Polish intellectuals, that they warned repeatedly against assimilation into American culture. It was the duty of the Pole to someday return to liberate the homeland. The PNA newspaper Zgoda warned in 1900, \\"The Pole is not free to Americanize\\" because Poland's religion, language and nationality had been quote partially torn away by the enemies. In other words, \\"The Pole is not free to Americanize because wherever he is ‚Äì he has a mission to fulfill.\\" Matthew Fry Jacobson, Special Sorrows: The Diasporic Imagination of Irish, Polish, and Jewish Immigrants in the United States (1995) p. 35 Contention with the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America Before the First World War, the PNA often found itself at odds with the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, a fraternal organization founded in 1873. The basic outward differences between the two fraternals are often remarked. The PRCUA, the earlier and more conservative, tended to support the American Catholic hierarchy over lay groups such as parish councils. The younger PNA was more radical in outlook and generally championed lay leadership over the Church hierarchy. However, the most important difference was that of world view. The PRCUA viewed the Polish American community in terms of okolica, or \\"local environment,\\" which it viewed as the starting point for building cultural awareness. The PNA viewed the Polish American community in terms of nar√≥d, or \\"nation,\\" which was constituted by the entire Polish people, at home and abroad, and took as its ultimate goal the reconstitution of divided Poland.See John Radzilowski, The Eagle and the Cross: A History of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, 1873‚Äì2000 (New York, 2003), pp. 69‚Äì70, Donald E. Pienkos, PNA: A Centennial History of the Polish National Alliance of the United States of America (Boulder, 1984) and At the Dawning of the New Millennium (Chicago, 2000) The two fraternals were able to reconcile their differences after 1945 and have coexisted amicably for decades. Newspaper and current activities In 1881, the PNA's official newspaper Zgoda was established through the efforts of Frank Gryglaszewski, later Censor of the PNA. It was followed in 1908 by the Polish-language daily Dziennik ZwiƒÖzkowy (Polish Daily News). In 1987 the AM radio station WPNA was established. In the years 1912‚Äì1914 the PNA financially supported the Temporary Commission of Confederated Independence Parties. During World War I it collaborated with the Polish National League and the Polish National Committee in Paris. During World War II it backed the Polish Government in exile. In 1944 PNA under President Charles Rozmarek was a co-founder of the Polish American Congress (pol. Kongres Polonii Ameryka≈Ñskiej), which shipped $150 million in goods to Polish refugees around the world. Charles Rozmerek, the president from 1939‚Äì1969 built a political machine from the Chicago membership, and played a role in Chicago Democratic politics. Since the end of the 19th century the PNA has been the largest Polish fraternal organization in the USA with assets of $500 million as a result of insurance activity (the only requirement of membership is to buy an insurance policy ‚Äì life, health etc.), and returns from banks and media they own. Administration The main authority of the organization is its Convention named Sejm ZwiƒÖzkowy, held every 4 years, but the government is the ZarzƒÖd with the president of the PNA, and the Board of Directors (pol. Rada Dyrektor√≥w). The supreme comptroller of the organization is Censor of the PNA (pol. cenzor ZNP), who is responsible only before the Sejm. The national headquarters of the Polish National Alliance is in the Forest Glen area of Chicago. The headquarters was relocated here in the 1970s from Chicago's Polish Triangle in West Town.

Background Kate Shaw worked in alternative theatre and arts publicity in Melbourne in the 1980s, before undertaking a post-Graduate Diploma in urban policy and planning (1993) and a Masters in urban planning (1999), both at RMIT. She then moved to the University of Melbourne and taught planning law, statutory planning, urban design, and ran classes on political economy, gentrification and the cultures of cities. Professor Shaw's PhD in planning (University of Melbourne, 2005) was \\"Room to move: the politics of protecting the place of alternative culture\\" and used a number of case studies from European and Australian cities to investigate the range of policies that have been used to support alternative culture in neighbourhoods subject to gentrification. From 2005 to 2008 she was research associate on a large project with Prof. Ruth Fincher titled \\"Transnational and Temporary: students, community and place-making in central Melbourne\\", looking at the growing student population and how they are housed in Melbourne. Her own ARC funded project on \\"Planning the ‚Äòcreative city‚Äô: reconciling global strategies with local subcultures\\" took place from 2009 to 2012. Scholarly contributions Her current research focuses on urban renewal in the 21st century. Accepting that the economic case for growth combines with the environmental case for limiting urban sprawl to produce an irresistible logic for increasing the densities of Australian cities, it explores ways of improving on the renewal projects of the last 50 years. Current work examines the legislative, regulatory, financial, political and cultural barriers to socially equitable urban development, and researches practices across the world that do it well. Her most recent book is Whose Urban Renaissance? An international comparison of urban regeneration policies, co-edited with Libby Porter of Monash University. Public engagement Dr. Shaw is notable for her work in connection with the protection of local cultural diversity and alternative sub-cultures. This has encompassed community activism and education, media contributionshttp://www.theage.com.au/federal- politics/political-opinion/the-ministry-of-silly-plans-20120813-244v1.html and academic publications. Shaw was involved in the 'Save the Espy' campaign in the late 1990s and early 2000s, formally known as The Esplanade Alliance.http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/16/1087244963667.html Interview, The Age, 2004. The Esplanade Hotel in the inner Melbourne suburb of St Kilda is an iconic venue famous for its support of a wide variety of Australian rock and alternative music acts. The site on which the hotel stands was purchased in 1997 by developer Becton who proposed to build a high-rise upmarket apartment complex to take advantage of the extremely good views across Port Phillip Bay and back to the Melbourne central city area. Apart from the debate about the merits of such a tall building in an otherwise relatively low-rise area, the concern of local residents and the music community was that even if the hotel itself was allowed to remain, the venue would soon be forced to stop hosting live music due to complaints from the residents of the new apartment tower, as has been the case in many other gentrifying suburbs, such as Fitzroy. The campaign was successful in reducing the height of the tower significantly and ensuring that key aspects of the hotels layout were retained to enable its survival as a live music venue.

The species is a member of the ovenbird family and only one of two species in the rayadito genus. The species' natural habitat is humid montane scrub, dominated by tree ferns (Dicksonia externa) and ferns (Lophosoria quadripinnata) between 800‚Äì1300 m above sea level (though they will descend lower during the austral winter). Masafuera rayaditos travel in pairs while feeding on arthropods; feeding occurs in the wood understory and occasionally on the ground in the leaf-litter. Nesting occurs at high altitudes (above 1200 m), in small natural crevices in rocks. The Masafuera rayadito is a critically endangered species. The species once occurred on surveys of the species in the 1980s found between 500-1000 birds but by 1992 that had dropped to 200 and by 2002 only 140. The species is threatened by introduced species, particularly goats which trample and degrade habitat, but also probably rats and feral cats. References *Remsen, V.

Celebration of Hindu Festivals  HEB‚Äôs involvement in community projects spans from free medical counseling services to bringing Deepavali joy to Little India, Singapore through a street light up and trade fair held annually during the festive season. Underprivileged Singaporeans in community homes and charities are not forgotten and benefit through Deepavali Cheer, HEB‚Äôs annual festive care and share programme. HEB is responsible for organizing major Hindu festivals like Thaipusam and Firewalking. It also helps other Hindu temples in Singapore on staff matters, religious issues and getting land for relocation of temples. HEB actively supports and is involved in inter religious activities and community service projects organized by the various religious groups in Singapore. History  Formation of the Hindu Endowments Board  The Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) was formed in 1968 by an Act passed in parliament which transferred the management of 4 major Hindu temples from the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowments Board (MHEB). The MHEB was formed in 1907 by the British Empire's government of Colony of Singapore in early Singapore to overcome shortcomings in the management of Hindu and Muslim religious entities.  Formation of the Hindu Advisory Board  In 1985, the Hindu Advisory Board (HAB) was established to advise the Government and HEB on matters of Hindu religion and customs. Both the Hindu Endowments Board and the Hindu Advisory Board are headed by Chairpersons appointed by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports. There are presently 16 members in HEB and 12 members in HAB.

This article refers to the S/34 and S/36 implementations of SDA. S/38 and AS/400 use a different SDA with different syntax and characteristics. See the AS/400 article for more about these midrange computers. SDA stands for Screen Design Aid. Programmers can use SDA to create menus, display formats, or WSU skeleton programs. IBM midrange computers utilize display stations to present information and to accept information and control from computer operators. A display station is an input/output device consisting of a monitor and a keyboard. S/34 and S/36 applications usually involve the operator to a critical degree, whether accepting the bulk of input through display stations or controlling them. Computer programs may utilize unformatted or formatted input, and this is where SDA applies. The Need For Display Formats An important challenge for harnessing the power of a midrange computer is interacting with an online user and providing ease of use. So what if your customer file has a million records... can your computer operator find the right one quickly? Concepts such as ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) have been around since the early days of computing. Using a display format, with colors, blinking fields, command keys, and scrolling functions, an operator can quickly adjust to advanced programs and become more effective. Starting SDA From any menu, type SDA and press Enter. Using SDA To Design A Menu Option 1 from SDA is to design a menu. Two different displays are used. On the first display, build the menu by typing the displayed menu text. The System/34 convention describes fixed-format and free-format menus. In a fixed-format menu, describe each menu item in 30 characters or less. In a free-format menu, lay out your menu exactly as you want it to appear. Press Cmd9 when you are done. On the second display, type the commands, procedures, or OCL associated with each menu item you are using. Many S/3X programmers use option 24 for sign-off, but this is not required. Press Cmd9 when you are done. When you have completed these displays, strSDA is ready to build your menu for you. Select your print and compile options and press Enter. Creating Display Formats or Menus From Code Like RPG II, display formats are built from column-sensitive specifications which describe fields of fixed sizes with fixed or conditioned properties. The System/36 version of SDA gained the H specification, which describes the displays used when the operator presses the \\"Help\\" key. The \\"Help\\" key can summon one display, a series of displays, or open an online document created by DisplayWrite/36 and position it to a certain page using a \\"bookmark.\\" If \\"Help\\" is program-coded, program control resumes when \\"Help\\" is pressed; in this instance, the program determines what action to take. If \\"Help\\" was not coded at all, a keyboard error occurs, stating that the Help key is not allowed now. All display formats have exactly one coded S specification, which describes the size of the format, the keys which may be used, the lines to be cleared, special functions such as sounding the Alarm (the \\"raspberry\\" sound is the only sound a S/3X terminal can be programmed to make), and most importantly the name of the format which must be referenced by the HLL (High-Level Language) program. Display formats may have one, many, or no D (\\"Detail\\") specifications to describe the field(s) used in the display. These fields may be constants, input, output, or input-output. Properties such as Nondisplay and Protected may seem to defeat the purpose of having the field, but there are non- intuitive uses for these fields. D specifications must state the starting line and column number used by the field; whether attributes or color are used; and, if a constant is declared, the value can also be declared. An \\"X\\" is used for continuation D specification(s) when a constant is larger than 24 characters. In order to accommodate displays created with the larger 27x132 capabilities, an odd system of hexadecimal entries is allowed for the column position. Display formats are so attuned to the RPG II language as to require language extensions when used with other HLLs. The 99 numbered RPG indicators perfectly match the screen indicators; however, take caution when coding display formats that you reserve indicator usage to match the current conditioning of the indicator when the display is written - otherwise, a dummy indicator used for Half-Adjust may end up positioning the cursor incorrectly. Accessing SDA Displays From S/3X Programs In RPG II, use the WORKSTN device and code the format member name in the F-specification . In COBOL, use the CONSOLE device. Use the DISPLAY verb to access the format name. In BASIC, OPEN a filespec and describe it as \\"WS,NAME=\\" followed by the name of the format load member. WRITE the filespec with the format name. In OCL, use the PROMPT statement, with the MEMBER defined as the format load member and FORMAT defined as the format name. Coding For The Audience When the IBM System/34 was sold, a common monitor would be a monochrome 12-inch IBM 5251; in the System/36 heyday, a common monitor would be the 12-inch IBM 5291 or the color 14-inch IBM 3486. Later in the S/36 life, third parties began to rise in popularity with such names as IIS, Decision Data, and Emerald. Not only do the third-party monitors cost much less, they offer multiple session capability, programmable color palettes, larger display areas, and a direct PC printer port which allows S/36 users to access inexpensive inkjet printers without a separate adapter. This is one reason why programming the S/36 has become more interesting over the years - the \\"blue\\" or \\"red\\" field one codes may not appear blue or red on all audience equipment. All S/34 and S/36 display stations use 5250 protocol; S/34 allows either 960-character displays or 1920-character displays; S/36 allows either 1920-character displays or (rare) 3564-character displays. Code two different display formats if it is possible that your audience might use the IBM 5252 Dual Display, which requires 960-character displays. Consider whether your audience will be using color or monochrome displays - an application developed for color-only might not function well on a monochrome display. Comparisons to Microsoft Access SDA is used to build display formats which are similar to the Microsoft Access convention of forms. Other similarities in nomenclature are as follows: *Input, Output, and I/O fields are similar to text boxes. *Constant fields are similar to labels. *Field characteristics (non-display, highlighted, underlined, blinking, column separators) are similar to properties that would be found on an object's property sheet. Properties can be changed on-the-fly just as indicators conditioning field characteristics can be changed. Important differences between Access forms and SDA display formats include: *Bound and unbound fields - SDA fields are always unbound. *SDA does not incorporate a record source, although a field can contain a Message Identifier Code of the form Mx9999 to access the Member1 or Member2 message member. *Display formats, fields, and characteristics cannot be changed during program execution.

Biography  Bj√∏rnson is, along with Grutle Kjellson, one of only two founding members left in the current line-up of Enslaved, being only 13 years old at the time of the band's formation in 1991. Bj√∏rnson and Grutle Kjellson performed in a death metal band called Phobia in 1989. The two decided that they wanted to form a new band in a more black metal style, and after discovering their shared fascination with Norse mythology, this set the groundwork for Enslaved. Beyond his duties on guitar, he writes almost all of the music for Enslaved as well as much of the lyrics. He has said that \\"When we started Enslaved we wanted to have the same level of commitment to something spiritual as our contemporaries in black metal [have with] the Satanic side. The dark destructive part of black metal didn't seem right because we didn't have any commitment to any Satanic ideology.\\" He contributed keyboard/synth work to Borknagar's first three albums and synth/piano work on the Gorgoroth albums Incipit Satan and Destroyer under the name \\"Daimonion\\"; and also produced the first demo from black metal band Orcustus. In 2011, Metalsucks named him the 22nd best modern metal guitarist, writing that \\"Ivar Bj√∏rnson pushed the boundaries of black metal so far that they‚Äôre in the blurry distance, only recognizable to those looking for them.\\" He has frequently cited Pink Floyd, Motorpsycho, and progressive rock as major influences on his songwriting, and has called Pink Floyd his favourite band. In 2014, the Norwegian government commissioned Ivar and Einar Selvik (Wardruna) to create a musical piece in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Norwegian constitution. The arrangement was titled 'Skuggsj√°', and was performed by Enslaved and Wardruna as a concert piece at the Eidsivablot festival in Eidsvoll, Norway on 13 September 2014. The music drew on the history, culture, and language of Norway and its Norse tradition, intended to tell the story of Norway, and to contextualise the past in Norway's present. The pair later decided that the project should be expanded upon, and further shows followed, including one at the popular Roadburn festival in 2015. They used the project's name and released the project as a full-length studio album on 11 March 2016.

At age six, he got his first taste of entertainment when a recreation director at a naval base in Norfolk, Virginia put him in front of a crowd of Navy wives; he sang \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\".Herman, Jan (September 20, 1988). \\"For Richard Doyle, an Actor's Life Is Driving\\", Los Angeles Times, p. 9. Retrieved December 4, 2013. His acting education included studies at Long Beach City College.  Career  Doyle had an earlier role in the second season of Barnaby Jones; episode titled, \\"Blind Terror\\"(09/16/1973). He has appeared on such TV series as Cheers, Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, Charlie's Angels, Dallas, M*A*S*H, Cannon, The Mod Squad, and worked with Ernest Borgnine on the science fiction series Future Cop. Doyle has also acted in non-traditional films for the museum field. In 1984, coinciding with the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he performed in a special effects holographic show entitled \\"Wizard of Change,\\" at the California Science Center, for the General Motors hosted exhibit \\"Wheels of Change,\\" which following the Los Angeles Olympics was transferred to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The 3D illusion show, designed by award winning experience designer Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, involved Doyle as a charming wizard character who explained that manufacturing was like magic that could transform base materials into modern miracles. Doyle worked again with Bob Rogers and BRC Imagination Arts in 2005 as he acted in the leading role for an educational 4D special effects film they produced for the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, \\"Lincoln's Eyes.\\" In this educational film, presented on three screens with supporting dimensional sets and in-theater atmospheric special effects, Doyle played the role of an artist who narrates the show, and discusses how he came about exploring the subject of Abraham Lincoln through Lincoln's life events. Beyond film, Doyle has earned much of his living as a voice actor, but says that he always preferred theatre work. He was a founding member of the South Coast Repertory theatre company.

(1984), following the pilot, was titled The Fallen Madonna.Broadcast 14 September 1984 In an earlier pilot, the painting was referred to as The Reclining Madonna. Recurring theme Allo 'Allo! was set in the French town of Nouvion during the German occupation of the Second World War. Its focus was a caf√© in the town square run by Ren√© Artois (played by Gorden Kaye). There were sustained attempts by the occupiers to appropriate the Fallen Madonna, a local treasure, to provide a nest egg after the war. Among those who coveted it were the local German commandant Colonel Kurt Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and the F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler himself on whose behalf Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) of the Gestapo was instructed to secure it (but secretly wanted it for himself). In the end of the Allo 'Allo! series the Fallen Madonna is found long after the war by an elderly Ren√©; he and his mistress Yvette quickly elope to Spain with the painting to live happily ever after. The painting was seen and hidden in various guises; it was often secreted, with suggestive possibilities, in a long knackwurst sausage. An incredible number of forgeries of the Fallen Madonna were made, mostly by Lieutenant Gruber and Monsieur LeClerc, which were hidden in knackwurst sausages in Ren√©'s kitchen.

He was a close associate of composer Pierre de La Rue.Meconi, p. 72Sherr, Grove online Life After first serving as a sommelier for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, then an infant, Reingot became part of the grande chapelle of Philip I. He first appears in the records of the Habsburg chapel singers in November 1501, in a master list of singers compiled prior to Philip's first trip to Spain. Reingot went on the trip, as part of the musical ensemble which was one of the most distinguished in Europe; they were in Spain for part of 1502, and singing again in France later that year.Meconi, pp. 29‚Äì36 Reingot went on Philip's second trip to Spain as well, the infamous trip which was to prove fatal to Philip, and fatal to the sanity of his wife, Joanna the Mad. In September 1506, when Philip died of a fever in Spain, many of the singers of the grande chapelle departed, mostly going back to France or the Netherlands, but Reingot was one of the ones who remained behind, along with Pierre de La Rue. For the next several years they took part in Juana's bizarre journey across Castile, each night singing a requiem to the disinterred corpse of Philip, which they brought along with them in its coffin, until Ferdinand II, Juana's father, had her locked up in the fortress at Tordesillas and had Philip more permanently buried.Meconi, p. 37-40; 72. By 1509, Reingot had returned north to the chapel of Charles, where he remained until around 1530. Nothing further is known of him after that year. Music While Reingot's music may once have been more abundant, only two pieces survive attributed to him: a four-voice motet setting of the Marian antiphon Salve regina, and a four-voice chanson, Fors seulement, based on the tune by Johannes Ockeghem. Reingot's version, published in Petrucci's Canti C, uses Ockeghem's superius transposed down an octave in the tenor voice and has three florid, quick-moving contrapuntal voices around it.

He died from Parkinson disease. Gaylord Carter in the patio of his home in Hollywood, California, 1940 Early Life and Musical Beginnings Gaylord Beach Carter was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, the son of Charles Davis Carter (1857‚Äì1940) & Olive Athena Beach (1873‚Äì1964). His father was a church organist and taught music, while his mother taught voice. They met in Europe and were married at Litchfield cathedral in England, eventually spending time in Wiesbaden, where Gaylord was born. Actually, Gaylord was originally to be called Mortimer Preston Carter, and the name Gaylord came about later. His family soon emigrated to the United States, settling in Wichita, Kansas, where his father opened a conservatory of music and also served as a church organist. Young Gaylord displayed the family talent for music and became a soloist in a church choir, until his voice changed. He also played the organ in another church from the age of ten. As the \\"Jazz Age\\" evolved, Gaylord found himself drawn to the new musical form and dared to try jazz on the church organ. On one occasion this transgression was discovered by the pastor, who then chastised him: \\"Gaylord, stop playing that high-falutin' music in church!\\". By the time he was fourteen he was playing at a local movie theater, accompanying the silent films at children's matinees. Silent Movie Era Career The family remained in Wichita until 1922 and then made the long drive in the family's Chandler touring car to Los Angeles, California, where 16-year-old Gaylord was enrolled at Lincoln High School in the Lincoln Heights district. Gaylord found employment at a local theater accompanying movies on the piano and then, as the theater prospered, a new Estey organ. After graduating from Lincoln High, he attended UCLA where, by 1926, he was engaged in pre-law studies. He continued playing in theaters to finance his education. Carter was playing accompaniment to a Harold Lloyd movie at the Seville Theater in suburban Inglewood when he was spotted by an agent of the Harold Lloyd Company, who had dropped in to see how the movie was doing at the box office. Gaylord would later tell audiences that the agent was there to \\"see that Lloyd got his proper cut from the box office\\". Impressed by the description of Carter's playing, Lloyd recommended him to Sid Grauman, who offered the 21-year-old $110 a week to be the full-time organist at his downtown Los Angeles movie palace, the Million Dollar Theatre. Carter accepted the offer and left school. Though he later paid for the college educations of his brother and sister, he never completed college himself. Carter was summoned to the UCLA deans' office and asked if his reason for leaving his law studies was financial. Carter replied, \\"Yes! I'm making too much money to stay!\\". 464 N. Laurel Ave., Hollywood, CA. Gaylord Carter's home from 1938-1968. Radio, Television, and Post-War Career Through the remainder of the 1920s, Carter played at the Million Dollar and other theaters, including Sid Grauman's larger downtown venue, Grauman's Metropolitan, the most capacious movie palace ever built in Los Angeles. The introduction of sound films, and then the onset of the depression, led to a declining demand for theater organists, and by the mid-1930s Carter had launched a career in the booming new medium of radio. He played on several network shows and also had his own local music show on Los Angeles station KHJ. In 1936 Carter became the staff organist for the hugely popular Amos N Andy radio show, a position he maintained until entering the Navy in 1942. He also made a film appearance in 1937, as himself, in the MGM short \\"Sunday Night at the Trocadero\\". The 18 minute short contained a sequence with singer Connie Boswell performing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\", with Carter providing accompaniment on the Hammond organ. When, at age 90, he was asked about the making of this short and if there had been any further film appearances he responded (with mock incredulity), \\"I don't remember making THIS one!\\".Gaylord Carter in the back yard of his Hollywood home. He spent the war years serving in the Navy as a film officer in Alaska. Following the war he resumed his radio career, playing for such shows as Bride and Groom, The Whistler and Suspense. He then moved on to television in the 1950s where he was the musical accompanist on the Pinky Lee Show, the association with which produced a 78rpm children's record on the Decca label that included Carter's rousing \\"Pinky Lee\\" theme on the Hammond. And in 1961-1962 Carter had another local show of his own, \\"Everybody Sing with Gaylord\\" on Los Angeles channel 13 KCOP-TV. No known videotapes or kinescopes exist of this program. In 1959 Carter spearheaded a revival of silent movies, beginning at the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena, California with Douglas Fairbanks' \\"The Mark of Zorro\\". During these years he also continued to perform occasional live organ concerts, both at those few theatres which had maintained their silent era organs, such as South Pasadena's Rialto Theatre and Seattle's Paramount Theatre, as well as public venues with theatre organs, such as the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. He also made recordings on several of these vintage instruments, releasing numerous albums on the Artisan, RCA Victor, Malar, Pelican, New World, Win Mil, Delos and FTC labels. Carter had previously recorded pipe organ and Hammond organ singles during the 1940s on the Capitol, Black & White, and Imperial labels. Also, the pioneer \\"program music\\" impresario C.P. MacGregor made recordings of Carter in the 1940s. MacGregor had a recording studio located on Western Ave. in Los Angeles. These were Hammond organ solos, and are astonishing upon the listening as regards the musical styles and technique Carter displays in them. Silent Movie Revival and Beyond In the 1960s and beyond, Carter helped fuel a revived public interest in silent movies with his production company Flicker Fingers Productions, which he had formed with business partner Jim Day. In the 1970s, Carter was hired to provide recorded scores for theatrical re-releases of several Mary Pickford movies. With the arrival of home video players, recorded versions of classic silent movies became available and Carter recorded scores, many of his own composition, for a variety of these films. Among them were many movies made by his early benefactor and old friend Harold Lloyd. Carter often told the story of scoring a Harold Lloyd picture with Lloyd present during the recording session; during the sequence from Safety Last! in which Lloyd is scaling the side of a building, he loses his grip. As Lloyd catches hold of the hands of an enormous clock, Carter at the organ swings into the song \\"Time on My Hands\\" ‚Äì which prompted Harold Lloyd to give Carter a mock stern glance and declare, \\"Gaylord, I'LL do the jokes!\\". Starting in 1975, Carter began recording Wurlitzer organ scores to classic silent films for Blackhawk Films, which distributed 8mm and 16mm film prints for the home movie market. In the 1980s, he scored a dozen silent classics for home video release by Paramount Pictures. Owing to the efforts of noted film historian and preservationist David Shepard, several of the Blackhawk films were later issued onto Laserdisc and then DVD through Image Entertainment. During the late 1960s, he also performed as the organist at Los Angeles Lakers games at the Forum, including at the 1969 NBA Finals. . He is known to have performed the manic organ part of \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" for the Haunted Mansion ride soundtrack.http://www.doombuggies.com/media_audio_30thtracklisting.php Final Years Gaylord Carter remained active into the 1990s. He made tours of North America, Europe, and Australia, performing on many of the world's surviving theater organs. In 1975 and 1994, he was inducted into the hall of fame of the American Theatre Organ Society. In 1987, he was the first organist to perform for the \\"Last Remaining Seats\\" program, which had been launched by the preservation organization, the Los Angeles Conservancy, playing the organ at the Orpheum Theatre in that city's Broadway Historic Theatre District, a few blocks from the Million Dollar Theatre which had been the scene of his first great success. In his last years he also performed occasionally at the Warner Grand Theatre, which was fairly near his home in San Pedro, California. Carter began experiencing T.I.A.s (transient ischemic attacks, or mini-strokes) at age 87 in 1992, but recovered sufficiently to continue performing. His last major performances were a pair of concerts on the occasion of his 90th birthday, at the Avalon Theater on Santa Catalina Island and the Paramount Theater in Oakland, California. After living in Hollywood for thirty years, he spent his final years in his home in the Los Angeles district of San Pedro, where he had resided since 1968 in a house designed by architect Richard Neutra. His 90th birthday and farewell performance celebration was held with the assistance of his protege Christian Elliott in 1995 at Oakland's Paramount Theatre. In 1996, he suffered a massive stroke at age 91, from which he recovered mentally but not physically. For the next four years he held court in San Pedro, unable to play but ever the witty survivor still receiving his many friends and admirers-who basked warmly in his company. After a second stroke in 2000, Gaylord Carter died peacefully in his home overlooking the Pacific Ocean at the age of 95. Notes Further reading Gaylord Beach Carter.

The group is signed both to Anticon and Alien Transistor. History The band's name 13 & God stems from the concept of the 12 apostles and Jesus Christ forming a group that comprises 13 mortal men as well as God. Distinguishing between Themselves and The Notwist in the context of which group is '13' and which is 'God' is thus disingenuous. In the example above, God is inherently contained within '13', creating a symbiotic relationship so strong it is unable to be severed. As 13 & God are not a Christian group, but do explore elements of philosophy, spirituality and existentialism, the name 13 & God is generally considered to be more of a reflection of those elements, as well as the concept of 'identity' itself.

It is a free, non- profit family event held every year on the last Saturday in April from 10am - 6pm, rain or shine. It coincides with Rutgers Agricultural Field Day held on the adjacent Cook Campus. Beginning in 2009, both the New Jersey Folk Festival and Ag Field Day are held as a major part of Rutgers Day. This year's theme is Oaxaca and will be taking place on Saturday, April 25th, 2020, virtually. The American Studies Department of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is the presenting sponsor of the New Jersey Folk Festival. The New Jersey Folk Festival, Inc. is also 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the State of New Jersey exempt from federal taxation.  History  Established in 1975, the New Jersey Folk Festival is the oldest continuously run folk festival in the State of New Jersey. Managed by a small team of Rutgers undergraduate students, the festival attracts over 15,000 people and is one of the City of New Brunswick's largest regularly scheduled events. The mission of the New Jersey Folk Festival is to preserve and protect the music, culture, and arts of New Jersey. Therefore, the main focus of this festival is the traditional music, crafts, and foods of the diverse ethnic and cultural communities within the state and its surrounding region. Typically, the event features three to four stages of music, dance, and workshops, a juried craft market, a children's activities area, a delicious array of food choices that offers everything from hamburgers, vegetarian fare, and funnel cake to a wide variety of ethnic foods, a folk marketplace, and a heritage area which offers a close- up look at each year's cultural or geographical theme or other appropriate exhibits. Each year the festival strives for diversity in selecting performers, not only seeking out traditional \\"American\\" artists, but also reaching out via fieldwork to the many ethnic communities found within New Jersey. The annual ethnic or regional feature contributes an essential intimate connection to these varied cultural groups represented in the state's population. The New Jersey Folk Festival is professionally supervised by its Founder and Executive Director, Dr. Angus Kress Gillespie, and by its Associate Director, Michelle Yasay, a former NJFF staff member and Rutgers University alumna. The following essays provide more information about the festival and its history:About the Festival http://www.njfolkfest.rutgers.edu/about.html * The Founding of the New Jersey Folk Festival by Dr. Angus Kress Gillespie, PhD * Beyond the Ivory Tower by Dr. Angus Kress Gillespie, PhD * Managing the New Jersey Folk Festival by Bill Seldon, NJFF Trustee  A Student-Run Event  This festival is the end product of a class intended, in part, to provide students with leadership opportunities. The festival is one of only a handful in the United States managed by undergraduate students. Collectively, the staff is responsible for continuing the festival's mission of celebrating the diverse multicultural and indigenous folk life of New Jersey. In 1975, when the festival first began, only two students were involved in its organization and management. Today, about fifteen students serve on the planning committee. Alumni of the festival also serve as advisors to the committee. The class meets for four hours once a week under the direction of faculty advisors Dr. Angus Kress Gillespie and Michelle Yasay. During the first half of the class, there is academic instruction in which the students learn about folklore, including the distinction between \\"traditional\\" versus \\"revival\\" folk music, theoretical problems associated with publicly presenting ethnic culture, the history and aesthetic sensibilities of the craft presenters and performers, as well as more practical instruction in how to write press releases or conduct radio interviews. The second half of the class functions as a business meeting led by the festival manager, complete with progress reports from coordinators, \\"breakaway\\" management teamwork sessions, and problem-solving. The student coordinators form a closely knit team, where they develop leadership and management skills, written and verbal communication, organization, personal assertiveness, and time management. The class is part of the curriculum of the American Studies Department of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  Festival Areas   Skylands Stage  The Skylands Stage is located in front of the Eagleton Institute. It offers music and dance presentations. The Opening Ceremony and the Awards Ceremony take place on this stage.  Shore Stage  The Shore Stage is located between the Food Market and the Craft Market. It offers three jam sessions and performances by the annual Singer- Songwriter Showcase winners. The jam sessions include a Bluegass jam, an Old- Timey jam, and an Irish Seisi√∫n.  Singer-Songwriter Showcase Contest  While the main focus of the festival is indigenous folk forms passed down via family, home, and community traditions, the festival likes to recognize regional folk artists in an effort to foster and encourage \\"new\\" folk singer- songwriters in their contemporary society. Winners are given the opportunity to present their original material to a large, diversified audience of over 15,000 attendees. At least six winners are selected to perform 20 minute sets. Three slots are reserved exclusively for artists submitting through SonicBids. The festival is especially interested in songs about the state of New Jersey. Though New Jersey has a diverse musical culture and history, it is the only state without a state song. The festival wishes to encourage singer- songwriters to develop material about its state. Artists are permitted to sell CDs at Folk Marketplace and retain 100% of the profits from sales. This contest is open only to singer-songwriters who have never before performed at the New Jersey Folk Festival. All entries must reflect original words and music. No instrumentals. Each artist must submit music and lyrics for three songs. All entry songs must be sung by the author. If selected, each artist agrees to perform only his or her own original material. No residency restrictions apply. Artists must agree to and be able to perform at the New Jersey Folk Festival to retain status as a winner. The festival encourages electronic submission through SonicBids. The Electronic Press Kits (EPKs) of SonicBids are a faster, cheaper, and easier way to submit your material.

Heritage Area  The Heritage Area comprises appropriate craft demonstrations and exhibits related to the current festival theme with one or two traditional \\"American\\" craft demonstrators.  Craft Market  The Craft Market consists of about 100 vendors. The focus of the juried craft market is on traditional folk art crafts. The work of each vendor has been pre-screened for top-notch quality as well as traditional nature. Crafts include jewelry, woodwork, pottery, ceramics, clothing, clothwork, etc.  Food Vendor Arc  The Food Vendor Arc consists of about two dozen diversified ethnic and traditional \\"American\\" food vendors located in a semi-circular arc between the Skylands and Shore Stages near the Loree Building.

You can pick up a festival performance schedule or purchase merchandise, including performer CDs, festival T-shirts, magnets, or keychains.  Festival Logo  The Jersey Devil serves as the official logo of the New Jersey Folk Festival. However, every year, a new logo embodying the current year's festival highlight is designed and used.  Original Logo  The original festival logo was the rooster. Back in 1975, the festival was managed by three people; Professor Gillespie as the Director, Kathy DeAngelo as the music coordinator, and Barbara Irwin as the crafts coordinator. When choosing a logo, the original committee turned to the folk art collection of the Newark Museum. There they found the cock weathervane made of copper in 19th century rural New Jersey. They felt that this rooster served as a fine symbol of the folk culture found in New Jersey in earlier days. Erwin Christensen in The Index of American Design explains that the rooster is probably the earliest weathervane design in the United States. This preference may be explained by the widespread use of this symbol on church steeples in Europe. According to tradition, the cock owed its place on church spires to Peter's denial of Christ. Hence, it served as a warning to the congregation not to do the same. In the Bayeux Tapestry of the 1070s, originally of the Bayeux Cathedral (Cath√©drale Notre-Dame de Bayeux) and now exhibited at Mus√©e de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, there is a depiction of a man installing a cock on Westminster Abbey.

The duo consists of MC Raw Poetic (Jason Moore) and producer K-Murdock (Kyle Murdock).Phoenix New Times. October 12, 2006; Panacea: Drink It Raw; retrieved April 29, 2007 Throughout their musical career, Panacea has had deals with various labels, including: Glow-in-the-Dark-Records, Rawkus Records Hip Hop Connection, November 2006 and Tasteful Licks. They currently release their music under K-Murdock's imprint, Neosonic Productions. Combining old- school rhyming with soulful beats, the Washington D.C. duo Panacea have drawn comparisons to revered hip-hoppers like The Roots, Gang Starr, and A Tribe Called Quest. Panacea blend Native Tongues-inspired beats with warm major chords and soul samples and add conscious rhymes about life, love, and hip hop.  K-Murdock Producer K-Murdock was born and raised in D.C. and has worked with Grammy Nominated R&B; singer Raheem DeVaughn. He was raised during the wilting years of hip hop and he developed his love of music at an early age through exposure from older family members (such as his uncle). One crew in particular, the Native Tongues, changed his musical life when he borrowed the cassettes of two of the collective's landmark groups (ATCQ & De La Soul) in the early 1990s. In 2010, K-Murdock produced an LP called Forever Famicom, a collaboration with rapper Random, which was released on Neosonic Records. Raw Poetic MC Raw Poetic is from Philadelphia. Raw Poetic is a rapper with a smooth, clean delivery that moves from quick-paced syncopation into hooks fluidly. Panacea When Poetic made the move to D.C., Panacea was born and in 2003 they announced their arrival with the debut EP Thinking Back, Looking Forward on the Los Angeles-based Glow-in-the-Dark label. Panacea generated interest from the re-emerging heavy hitter Rawkus Records which resulted in a joint venture between the two labels. ‚ÄúPartnering with Rawkus increases the visibility of each project.

He was regarded as one of the finest English jazz drummers and bandleaders, occasional but capable pianist and vibraphonist, and an energizing influence on the British jazz scene over six decades. Career Crombie was a self-taught musician who began playing the drums at the age of fourteen. He was one of a group of young men from the East End of London who ultimately formed the co-operative Club Eleven, bringing modern jazz to Britain. Having gone to New York with his friend Ronnie Scott in 1947, witnessing the playing of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, he and like- minded musicians such as Johnny Dankworth, Scott and Dennis Rose, brought be- bop to the UK. This group of musicians were the ones called upon if and when modern jazz gigs were available. In 1948 Crombie toured Britain and Europe with Duke Ellington, who had been unable to bring his own musicians with him, except for Ray Nance and Kay Davis. Picking up a rhythm section in London, he chose Crombie on the recommendation of Lena Horne, with whom Crombie had worked when she appeared at the Palladium. In August 1956, Crombie set up a rock and roll band he called The Rockets, which included future Shadows bassist Jet Harris. The group was modelled after Bill Haley's Comets and Freddie Bell & the Bellboys. Crombie and his Rockets released several singles for Decca and Columbia, including \\"Teach You to Rock\\" produced by Norrie Paramor, which made the Top 30 in the UK Singles Chart in October 1956. He is credited with introducing rock and roll music to Iceland, performing there in May 1957. By 1958 the Rockets had become a jazz group with Scott and Tubby Hayes. During the following year Crombie started Jazz Inc. with pianist Stan Tracey. In 1960, he composed the score for the film The Tell-Tale Heart and established residency at a hotel in Monte Carlo. In May 1960 he toured the UK with Conway Twitty, Freddy Cannon, Johnny Preston, and Wee Willie Harris. In the early sixties Crombie's friend and contemporary, Victor Feldman, passed one of his compositions to Miles Davis, who recorded the piece on his album Seven Steps to Heaven. The song, \\"So Near, So Far\\", has been recorded by a number of other players including Joe Henderson, who named a tribute album to Miles Davis using the title. During the next thirty years Crombie appeared with many of the greatest American jazz musicians, including Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, Illinois Jacquet, Joe Pass, Mark Murphy and Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis. In the mid-1990s, after breaking his arm in a fall, he stopped playing the drums but continued composing until his death in 1999. Crombie was married twice. He had a son and daughter from his first marriage and another daughter from his second. One of his grandsons is the drummer, music producer and composer Dylan Freed.

One of the finest to emerge during the 1930s,[ Allmusic biography] he is best known as a member of the Ahmad Jamal trio from 1957 to 1962. A close contemporary of fellow bassist Jimmy Blanton, Crosby is less considered as a pioneer, but his interactive playing in Jamal's trio and that of George Shearing shows how easily and fluently he displayed a modern approach to jazz double bass. He is credited with taking the first recorded bass solo on his 1935 recording of \\"Blues of Israel\\" with drummer Gene Krupa (Prestige PR 7644) when he was only 16. One of Teddy Wilson's most celebrated instrumentals, \\"Blues In C Sharp Minor\\" from May 14, 1936 featured Crosby's prominent slap bass. Crosby died of a heart attack at age forty-three, two months after joining the Shearing Quintet.

The community is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Traphill is listed as a ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) by the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the 2000 Census, the population of Traphill was 1,936. Stone Mountain State Park, one of the most popular state parks in North Carolina, is located in Traphill.  History   Trap Hill  Joining other settlers on the northern edge of Wilkes County in 1775, William Blackburn settled in the present day area of Stone Mountain State Park. Blackburn devised an innovative rail-pen wild turkey trap. These traps and their eventual popularity are commonly recalled as the source of the town's name, although others have varied accounts. Many of the earliest settlers in the region settled along the headwaters of the Roaring River.  Chang and Eng Bunker  In 1839 Chang and Eng Bunker, the world-famous Siamese twins who were a popular attraction in Europe, Asia, and North America, settled in the Traphill community. The Twins purchased a farm, where they lived until 1849. They married two local sisters, Chang to Adelaide Yates and Eng to Sarah Ann Yates. Chang and Adelaide had ten children; Eng and Sarah had twelve.  Traphill during the Civil War  During the American Civil War the citizens of Traphill were opposed to secession and gained a reputation as pro-Union sympathizers during the conflict. A Traphill resident, John Quincy Adams Bryan, helped recruit local men into the Union Army. In August 1863, a militia of pro-Union Traphill citizens marched into Wilkesboro and, during a pro-Union rally, defiantly raised a Union flag in front of the county courthouse. Traphill's anti-Confederate, pro-Union reputation led deserters, outlaws and refugees to move into the region. Traphill residents frequently helped Confederate deserters and escaped Union POWs evade Confederate and Home Guard forces.  20th century into present  During the Prohibition era of the 1920s and 1930s Traphill became a center of the mass production and exportation of illegal homemade liquor, or moonshine. Moonshine became the main source of income for many Traphill families, and until the 1980s, the town continued producing over a million gallons of white liquor each year. Traphill residents made sugar and grain liquor for sale and fruit \\"brandy\\" for personal consumption, and continue to do so, with apple and peach brandies being the most common. From the 1920s to the 1960s Federal tax agents, state police units, and local police all patrolled the hills and hollows looking for moonshine stills. During the Prohibition era Traphill became known for violence and gunplay between the moonshiners and law-enforcement officials. The ridge along the east prong of the Roaring River in Traphill earned the nickname \\"cutthroat ridge\\" after consistent disputes between distillers and lawmen. Liquor production became such a common practice, competition became \\"cutthroat.\\" After a Traphill resident killed the Sheriff of Wilkes County in 1936, it was said that the \\"law wouldn't have nuthin' to do with Traphill.\\" However, as liquor was legalized and tourism became a major source of income for local residents the amount of violence sharply declined later in the 20th century. Today Traphill is mostly a quiet farming community known for its superb mountain scenery. Stone Mountain State Park, one of North Carolina's most popular state parks, is located in Traphill; the park's presence has led to many out-of-state residents (especially from Florida) building summer homes in the area. The Holbrook Farm and Traphill Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  References  1\\\\. Wilkes County Sketches J. Jay Anderson, p. 39, 1976 2\\\\.

It was built by impresario Sid Grauman, who had already built the Million Dollar Theatre a few blocks away, but who is best remembered today for his two Hollywood movie palaces, Grauman's Chinese Theatre and Grauman's Egyptian Theatre. It was also home to variety acts. In 1941, Fats Waller, Rochester and Kitty Murray were all on the bill together. The theater became famous as the birthplace of \\"All That Meat and No Potatoes\\" - a Waller onstage wisecrack about the \\"brick house\\" physique of singer-dancer Murray. The largest movie theater ever built in Los Angeles, the Metropolitan was acquired by the exhibition arm of Paramount Pictures in 1929 and renamed. The building had been designed by architect William Woolett, and the massive six-floor commercial and office block in which it was encased was a major landmark across from Pershing Square for several decades. Paramount operated the venue through the 1950s. It was closed in 1960 and demolished the following year to make way for a high rise office building which was never built. After the site served as a parking lot for many years, a building from the wholesale jewelry trade was erected on there in the late 1970s and remains today. The theater was located at 6th and Hill Streets, one block west of Broadway, where most of the city's major theaters were then located. After the Metropolitan opened, Grauman decided to build an entrance on Broadway and constructed a building with a grand stairway up to a long hall which entered the theater on the mezzanine level, crossing a bridge over an alley to reach it. This entrance was closed by the Paramount company and the Broadway space rented out for retail use. When the theater was demolished, this annex survived and is today the only part of the theater that remains. The theater was demolished and the 16-story International Jewelry Center wa built on the site, opening in 1981 and as of 2020 still operating as such with jewelers and other office and retail occupants.‚ÄúInternational Jewelry Center‚Äù, Emporis References External links Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Los Angeles Category:Demolished theatres in Los Angeles Category:Former cinemas in the United States Category:Theatres completed in 1923 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1961 Category:1923 establishments in California Category:1960 disestablishments in California ","title":"Paramount Theatre (Los Angeles)"},{"id":"10960182","text":"The Burma Muslim Congress (BMC) was a Muslim political party in Burma (present-day Myanmar). History The party was founded around the same time as the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), which it became affiliated with in December 1945. The party's first president, U Razak, became president of the AFPFL's Mandalay branch in 1946.Haruhiro Fukui (1985) Political parties of Asia and the Pacific, Greenwood Press, p119 Razak was subsequently appointed Minister of Education and Planning in Aung San's government, a post he held until he was assassinated alongside San.Moshe Yegar \\"The Muslims of Burma\\", A study of a minority Group, p75 Following Razak's death, secretary-general U Khin Maung Lat succeeded him as party president. He became a member of the AFPFL Supreme Council, and was appointed Minister of Justice in 1950, a post he held until 1958. A few months after independence in 1948, new Prime Minister U Nu requested that the BMC leave the AFPFL. In response, U Khin Maung Lat decided to discontinue the party's Islamic religious activities and rejoin the AFPFL. In 1954 the AFPFL Supreme Council asked the party to fully merge into the AFPFL and cease to exist as a separate organisation. Although this request was initially refused, the party did merge in 1956. The party was immediately re-established by U Than Myint, who moved it to the left. It joined the National United Front alliance in 1958, but left in 1960, changing its name to Pathi Congress and began campaigning for a separate state for Burmese Muslims, before haemorrhaging support.

It describes the impacts of newer uses on prior activities occurring in mixed-use areas. Some activities tend to have the effect of limiting the ability of established ones to continue. A key instance is the impact of new residential development on mixed use neighbourhoods as an area goes through a process of gentrification. Such prior uses might be entertainment, commercial or industrial uses. New residents tend to have expectations of a level of amenity comparable to suburban residential areas and will complain about noise from established uses. This has previously had the effect of imposing economic burdens or operational limitations on the prior uses that reduce their viability, forcing them to close down or move. The concept of reverse sensitivity suggests that a reversal of this approach is possible and that the burden of providing residential amenity in mixed-use environments should fall to the developers of new residential buildings in those areas. Planning schemes can regulate these issues via zoning ordinances.  References  * Reverse Sensitivity * What is reverse sensitivity?

It is located nearly southwest of the city centre, and sandwiched between Air Itam to the west and Jelutong to the east. Formerly an agricultural area, Batu Lanchang has turned into a suburban residential area, with a mix of high-rises and landed properties. Green Lane, in particular, has become an affluent neighbourhood, whilst also serving as a major thoroughfare through Batu Lanchang, linking George Town and Gelugor.  History  An apartment at Batu Lanchang Avenue Taman Free School Batu Lanchang was once an agricultural area, where coconut groves stretched all the way to the hills of Air Itam. At the time, Green Lane was the only road through Batu Lanchang; true to its name, it was a country path lined with trees. Urbanisation of the area began in the 1950s, when residential high rises were first built along Green Lane. The development of residential estates around Green Lane, such as Island Park and Island Glades, have transformed it into a wealthy suburban neighbourhood. Development then gradually spilled out across Batu Lanchang, leading to residential high rises like the Central Park condominiums.  Transportation  To this day, Green Lane serves as the main thoroughfare within Batu Lanchang. It forms part of the Penang Middle Ring Road and is heavily used by motorists daily. Other major roads within this suburb include Jalan Tan Sri Teh Ewe Lim (formerly Batu Lanchang Road) and Batu Lanchang Lane; the former leads towards Jelutong while the latter links the suburb with Air Itam. Rapid Penang buses 11, 13, 206 and 304 serve the residents of the suburb, by connecting Batu Lanchang with George Town to the north and other destinations on Penang Island, such as Jelutong, Gelugor, Air Itam and Paya Terubong.  Education  Penang Free School has produced several prominent personalities throughout its long history. Heng Ee High School is well known for the strong academic performance of its students. A total of two primary schools, seven high schools and a vocational school are located within Batu Lanchang. Notably, Green Lane is home to two of Penang's top missionary schools - Penang Free School and Convent Green Lane. Penang Free School is also the oldest English school in Southeast Asia, with a history dating back to 1816. Aside from Penang Free School and Convent Green Lane, Batu Lanchang contains two of the more well-known Chinese high schools in Penang - Chung Hwa Confucian High School and Heng Ee High School. Chung Hwa Confucian High School was established in 1904, making it the oldest Chinese school in Penang. The schools within Batu Lanchang are as follows. Primary schools * SRK Batu Lanchang * SRJK (C) Kheng Tean High schools * Penang Free School * Convent Green Lane * Chung Hwa Confucian High School * Heng Ee High School * SMK Hamid Khan * SMK Georgetown * SMK Haji Zainul Abidin Vocational school * SMV Batu Lanchang In addition to these schools, the Penang Digital Library is also located within the grounds of Penang Free School. Launched in 2016, it is the first digital library in Malaysia and contains a digitalised collection of over 3,000 reading materials.  Health care  Lam Wah Ee Hospital, one of the several private hospitals on Penang Island, is located at the junction of Green Lane and Jalan Tan Sri Teh Ewe Lim. Since its establishment in 1883, the hospital continues to provide traditional Chinese health care to this day, whilst also offering modern treatments as with other private hospitals. Two other private specialised medical centres within Batu Lanchang are the Carl Corrynton Medical Centre and the Optimax Eye Specialist Hospital.

It is located in Lawaan III Talisay City Cebu, Philippines. It was established to provide salesian formation for the candidates to the priestly and religious life of the Salesian Province of Mary Help of Christians (FIS) in the Philippines. Sectors and offices Aspirantate The Aspirantate of Don Bosco Missionary Seminary was once known as the College Seminary. It superseded the high school aspirantate when the Salesians decided to close down the high school aspirantate. The College Aspirantate was installed in Don Bosco Missionary Seminary last 2004. Don Bosco Formation Center, as it was named, was established in Don Bosco Technology Center for the formation of Salesian Brothers. It now serves as a formation center for Salesian vocations for college and young professionals. Formation tracks The aspirantate program of DBFC branched out to accommodate the candidates' needs: college aspirantate, Rinaldi program, and the Zatti program. All three tracks share the aspects of formation in home life, community life, youth ministry, intellectual preparation, and psych-social guidance. Skills in music, sports, technical, and manual work are also inserted into the formation program. Young men who finished their basic education are admitted to the formation center for college aspirancy. The aspirancy consists in a four-year program of Bachelor of Arts in Religious Education and Pastoral Communication (AB ReEd PasCom), a double major degree recognized by the Philippines' CHED. This enables the candidate to professionalize himself in the field of education and evangelization, the two-pronged approach of the Salesian mission. Young professionals who finished their college degrees or are already working in their respective fields are admitted for the Rinaldi program. The program is named after one of Don Bosco's successor, Blessed Father Philip Rinaldi, who became a Salesian later in life. It consists of one year aspirancy with studies in the Evangelium Catechetical program that seeks to deepen the candidate's Christian and Salesian formation. A special track of formation for the Salesian Brotherhood is called the Zatti program, named after Blessed Artimide Zatti, an Argentinian Salesian brother. The specialized program is designed to deepen the knowledge of the Salesian brother vocation through several conferences and inputs. Pre-novitiate The Pre-novitiate is the first canonical stage of Salesian initial formation. It is a ten-month preparation program of candidates to the Salesian religious novitiate. The pre-novitiate is designed for the human formation of the candidate through intensive psycho-sexual-social intervention. Sacred Heart Novitiate The Sacred Heart Novitiate houses the novices from the north and south Philippine Salesian Provinces (FIN and FIS), China and Japan Provinces, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea Mission Territories. It is the principal entry into the Salesian congregation where candidates to the Salesian life spend a year of study of the Salesian constitutions, prayer, and life. Don Bosco Retreat House The Retreat House is found atop a hill, secluded from the noise of the city. It was built for providing affordable and reasonable accommodations for retreatants especially the poor. The Salesian community of DBMS caters to the needs of the retreat house. Don Bosco Center for Lay Adults and Youth DB-CLAY is one of the offices established by the Provincialate to cater to the needs of the province. It was established to cater to the formation of lay people. This includes lay youth and workers in the different Salesian settings of the province. Mission-vision Don Bosco Center for Lay Adults and Youth is a Salesian Institute of formation for Lay Adults and Youth to become Christ-centered, empowered servant leaders, living witnesses and agents of transformation in the family, society, and the Church. DB-CLAY commits itself to provide a Holistic Christian formation inspired by the spirit and example of St. John Bosco, to develop: * Lay People to respond to the call of holiness; * Members of the Salesian Family to grow in their Salesian vocation; * Salesian lay mission partners to deepen their involvement in the Salesian mission; * Youth to grow into empowered servant leaders Salesian Community The Salesian Community of Don Bosco Missionary Seminary aside from the task of administration is the animating nucleus of the formation center.

The custom of bringing Devagange (Gange taruvud - ‡≤ó‡≤Ç‡≤ó‡≥Ü ‡≤§‡≤∞‡≥Å‡≤µ‡≥Å‡≤¶‡≥Å/Devaru taruvudu - ‡≤¶‡≥á‡≤µ‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤§‡≤∞‡≥Å‡≤µ‡≥Å‡≤¶‡≥Å) into homes from nearby water-sources (usually from wells) is a tradition in Lingayat household for every important functions held (like Marriage, House-warming, Naming, Lingadhaarana...etc.), some Vokkaligas in Karnataka also perform this custom - in this custom Veerabhadra is taken to please mother Ganga, Veeragaase is performed while bringing her home - in Veeraagama Ganga is considered to be the mother of Veerabhadra as he was sprouted out of Shiva's hairs and Ganga has taken residence on Shiva's head. Daksha Yajna Veeragase gets its name from the Hindu legendary warrior lord - Veerabhadra; Ajaata putra (Non biological child - who didn't take birth formally) of lord Shiva. According to Puranas, the Hindu supreme deity Lord Shrimanmahaa Shankara bhagavaan (Shiva) was married to Sati(who is also known as Daakshayini - since she was the favouritest child of Daksha - He got maata Aadishakti incarnated as his child after doing long penance to her). Daksha(the prajapati - one of the eight manasputras of Brahma and a stauch Vaishnavite - Vishnu happens to be his grandfather in vasthu roopa) was against this marriage because Shiva had beheaded Brahma(Daksha's father) and being Moola-purusha Shiva actually didn't follow any rules(As he was nirguNi) designed by Daksha which made him not to belong to any of the class-categories classified by Daksha(being a Prajaapati, it was his duty to classify everybody from Lord Vishnu - to smallest organism)) and hence bore enmity with Lord Shiva; He married his favouritest daughter Sati to Lord Shiva after multiple insistence from his aaraadhya(celebrated) Lord Vishnu and his father Brahma. Added to this enmity Lord Shiva after marriage, did not do proper conventional(Conventions designed by Daksha in his Shaastras) reverence which is to be done by a son-in-law to his father-in-law, instead Lord Shiva blessed him for Daksha's prosperity; which yet enraged Daksha's ego, so he decided to perform a mahaayagna to which he invited all except the Aadipurusha Lord Shiva himself. In vasthu roopa since Sati was Daksha's favourite child; she couldn't refrain from attending her father's greatest of yajnas. To this, much against Shiva's wishes, Daakshayini went to the yagna uninvited, By then Daksha's favoritism for Sati was perished since she was vaamaangi(left part of the body) of his enemy and he used the situation to insult Mahadeva. Unable to bear the insults - She cursed her father for his ego and showed her nija rupa(as Adishakti); she cursed everybody from Vishnu to Brahma to each individual present over there; Even after many condolences from Vishnu and Brahma, Daakshayini got herself burnt with her own powerful radiance. Hearing this news, Mahaarudra Mahakaala Lord Shiva got very angry and started to perform the RudraTandava dance which created turmoil in the world. In this rage he created Veerabhadra and BhadrakaaLi out of his JaTa (tied hair-matts), who went to Dakshayagna, disrupted it and beheaded Daksha, after defeating Vishnu, Bhaga, Poosha, Adityas...etc. When Daksha's wife pleaded mercy, he died and bestowed Daksha with a goat's head. This story is narrated by the dancers performing Veeragase.The mythology related to Veeragase is explained by Performers Veeragase is to be performed only by the Jangama also called Maheshwaras - clan of Veerashaiva/Lingayat community. The performers of Veeragase are also called Lingadevaru.A description of the Veeragase dance form is provided by The dancers put on a white traditional headgear and a bright red coloured dress. They also adorn themselves with a necklace made of Rudraksha beads, a hip-belt called rudra muke, an ornament resembling a snake and worn around the neck called Nagabharana and anklets.A description of the dress worn by Veeragase dancers is provided by The dancers smear vibhooti on their foreheads, ears and eyebrows. They carry a wooden plaque of Lord Veerabhadra in their left hand and a sword in their right hand. Female artists do not traditionally perform this art, but females have started to be a part of stage performance of non-religious nature which merely as a folk dance . Performance The dance troop usually consists of two, four or six members. A lead singer in the troupe narrates the story of Daksha yajna as the dance is being performed. A huge decorative pole called Nandikolu which has an orange flag at the top is held by one of the dancers. Traditional percussion instruments called sambal and dimmu lend music to the dance. Cymbals and shehnai and other instruments like karadi and chamala are also used.

He is a partner in the Little Rock law firm of McDaniel, Richardson & Calhoun, PLLC. McDaniel's practice focuses on administrative law, regulatory affairs, government relations, business litigation, and criminal law. McDaniel represents individuals and businesses ranging from healthcare to technology, as well as regulated industries such as tobacco and medical cannabis. McDaniel is licensed in the District of Columbia and enjoys a national law practice representing individuals and corporations interacting with State Attorneys General, Governors, and Arkansas state government. From 2005-2007, McDaniel served in the Arkansas House of Representatives, serving on the House Public Health, Welfare, and Labor Committee and as Co-Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Health Insurance and Prescription Drugs.  Early life and education  Dustin McDaniel was born in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He is the oldest son of Bobby McDaniel and Melody Gammon Konnerth. McDaniel has one sibling, Brett Anthony McDaniel, who is an attorney in Jonesboro, Arkansas. His father, Bobby, graduated from the University of Arkansas School of Law after Dustin was born. Mike Beebe, the 45th Governor of Arkansas, was a fellow law student and friend of the family. McDaniel attended Jonesboro Public Schools, graduating from Jonesboro High School in 1990. He attended the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, where he was a student at the Walton College of Business. He is a member of the Xi Chapter Kappa Sigma fraternity and the President of the Interfraternity Council. He graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Public Administration in 1994. In 1996, McDaniel enrolled at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock's William H. Bowen School of Law. During his time at Bowen, he was elected Honor Council Prosecutor and served as Assistant Articles Editor for the UALR Law Review. After two and a half years, he graduated cum laude with his Juris Doctor in January 1999.

In 1998, a mass school shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas at Westside Middle School killed 4 students and 1 teacher and wounded 10 other students. McDaniel saw the news breaking on CNN and drove to Jonesboro to report for duty and go to the scene. He spoke of it often in his public life. McDaniel's father, Bobby McDaniel, filed suit on behalf of the families of the dead against the shooters and the manufacturers of the firearms used. The suit was filed before Dustin McDaniel had a law license, but nonetheless it was used by former Senator Gunner DeLay in 2006 as evidence of McDaniel's lack of trustworthiness on Second Amendment Issues. McDaniel fought back by touting his law enforcement background and that he was an avid hunter. In 2017, the families were awarded an uncollectable judgment of $150 million against Andrew Golden and Mitchell Johnson. Private practice After law school, McDaniel joined his father's law firm, McDaniel & Wells, P.A. (now McDaniel Law Firm) in Jonesboro, Arkansas. He remained at McDaniel & Wells from 1999-2007.

Arkansas House of Representatives  On July 1, 2003, McDaniel announced his candidacy for the 75th District Arkansas House of Representatives. The 75th District encompassed the metropolitan Jonesboro area. His primary opponent was veteran and school administrator Paul House. After securing the Democratic primary, McDaniel went on to face Bille Sue Hoggard (R) in the general election. McDaniel won, receiving 53% of votes. In that same election, President George W. Bush (R) defeated Sen. John Kerry (D) 53% to 46% in Arkansas House District 75 (Craighead County). _May 18, 2004 Democratic Primary Results_ {  Candidate Total Votes Received - Paul House 1,992 (42%) - Dustin McDaniel 2,745 (58%) } _November 2, 2004 General Election Results_ {  Candidate Total Votes Received - Dustin McDaniel (D) 6,361 (53%) - Billie Sue Hoggard (R) 5,655 (47%) } McDaniel was sworn into the 85th Arkansas General Assembly in January 2005.

In 2007, McDaniel helped resolve Lake View School District No. 25 v. Huckabee, a fifteen-year-old case filed by the Lake View School District that examined the structure for the funding of Arkansas schools. This case led to the subsequent overhaul of public school funding with the aim to be more fair and exact and to benefit all Arkansas students equally. McDaniel worked closely with legislators during his first two years as Attorney General, and in April 2006, the Arkansas General Assembly passed legislation that gave the public schools additional funding, and the special masters‚Äô final report in 2007 was positive, leading the court to declare the funding program for education to be constitutional. Through a final series of reforms, the Lake View School District was consolidated with the Barton-Lexa School District. McDaniel demanded that payday lenders in Arkansas shut down or face legal action, ordering nearly 156 outlets shut down and stating: \\"In addition, I hereby demand you void any and all current and past-due obligations of your borrowers, and refrain from any collection activities related to these payday loans\\". More than $7 million was awarded through litigation on behalf of payday loan customers. In 2009, after a year debate and discussion between agriculture advocates and animal welfare organizations, McDaniel brokered a successful bill to address animal cruelty. The bill, SB 77, called for a felony charge of aggravated animal cruelty for a first offense when committed against a dog, cat, or horse. The bill defined animal cruelty as mistreating an animal, killing or injuring an animal that is not your own, abandonment, starvation, failure to provide adequate shelter, or dragging an animal behind a vehicle. SB 77 included stiffer penalties when the abuse is committed in front of a child, increased penalties for subsequent misdemeanor charges (the fourth misdemeanor charge would result in a felony) and required psychological evaluations for offenders. The bill also outlawed all animal fighting as at the time, only dog fighting was illegal. The bill became Act 33 of 2009. McDaniel passed legislation empowering the Attorney General's Office as the statewide law enforcement agency, allowing for the creation for a cyber division that pursued online sex offenders. Second term McDaniel was unopposed in the 2010 Democratic Party Primary. During the general election, he again faced Green Party candidate Rebekah Kennedy. McDaniel easily defended his seat, capturing 72.8% of the vote to secure a second term. {  Candidate Total Votes Received - Dustin McDaniel (D) 526,209 (72.8%) - Rebekah Kennedy (G) 196,605 (26.8%) } Dustin McDaniel presenting his arguments to the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court in Blueford v.

Arkansas (2012).Blueford v. Arkansas The term also included multiple settlements he procured on behalf of the State of Arkansas. In March 2013, McDaniel announced an arbitration panel issued a ruling that allowed a settlement to proceed between Arkansas and the tobacco companies that signed the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. Arkansas received the entire amount of settlement money that was in escrow, which amounted to $22.7 million. That November, McDaniel successfully negotiated a settlement agreement with North Little Rock School District, Pulaski County Special School District, and the Little Rock School District that phased out millions in ongoing, annual desegregation payments.

In the first six months, McDaniel raised over $1.5 million. Early polling showed McDaniel as an overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination. However, in 2010 and 2012, Republicans took over Arkansas politics and early polling showed McDaniel as a long shot against Republican opponent Asa Hutchinson. After admitting to ‚Äúan inappropriate relationship‚Äù with a Hot Springs attorney, McDaniel withdrew from the race in January 2013. After McDaniel's withdrawal, former Congressman Mike Ross entered for the Democratic nomination. In 2014, Asa Hutchinson defeated Mike Ross to become the 46th Governor of Arkansas.

Debut album In 1997 their debut CD was released. The mini- album, Moondrive was well received across the globe. However K√ºhne decided to leave the band at the end of 1997, and was replaced by Menno Boomsma. The release of Moondrive was followed by a series of concerts, commencing at the first ProgFarm in Bakkeveen, Tivoli (ProgWorld), De Lantaarn (SympHel) and Hedon (with Pallas) followed shortly after. New millennium After two fruitful years and a sold out album, Odyssice decided to take it slow in 1999. They worked on new material for the follow-up to Moondrive. The new songs were finished at the end of that same year and, in January 2000, the recording of Impression took place. Shortly after the recording contract was signed with Cyclops Records, Impression was released worldwide on 1 November 2000. In 2001, there were two performances in which Odyssice played tracks from both Moondrive and Impression. By mid-2002, van de Pol decided to leave the band and focus on a completely different style of music, leaving Boomsma, Peeters and van der Wiel without a bassist. In June 2003, the Moondrive album was re- issued, which contained a multimedia part with live videos. At the end of 2004, Odyssice finally decided to employ Peter Kosterman as their new bass player. On 23 May 2010 their new album, Silence was released. It received a 'vette krent' (highly recommendated) noting in the Dutch progressive music magazine, IO-Pages. Before the recording processes began, the band made a live television recording at RTV-NoordHolland. The DVD of this session will be released in 2011. Odyssice undertook a number of concerts in October 2010, including at 'de Boerderij' in Zoetermeer, Netherlands.

Part of Penang Middle Ring Road, Green Lane starts from the intersection with Scotland Road and Air Itam Road, and stretches southwards to the Udini Roundabout within the Gelugor suburb. Once a quiet, leafy road, Green Lane has witnessed rapid urbanisation since the 1950s, turning it into an affluent neighbourhood. Even so, the road is still well-known for its greenery, with mature trees lining both sides of Green Lane, as well as its central divider. Green Lane is also where two of Penang's top missionary schools - Penang Free School and Convent Green Lane - are located.  Etymology  Whilst Green Lane was officially renamed as Jalan Masjid Negeri in the 1980s, local Penangites still refer to the road as Green Lane. This is partly because the new name sounds unwieldy, but also reflects a strong sense of conservatism among the locals, who view Penang's colonial history as part of their local identity. History Up until the mid-20th century, Green Lane was home to a small farming community. At the time, much of the road traversed through the countryside outside of George Town. In 1928, Penang Free School was relocated, from Farquhar Street in the city centre, to Green Lane. Since the 1950s, Green Lane has been developed into an affluent suburban neighbourhood, with residential estates such as Taman Greenview, Taman Green Lane and Island Glades lining the road. The massive industrialisation in Bayan Lepas to the south further boosted Green Lane's importance as a major trunk road between George Town and Bayan Lepas. In the 1980s, Green Lane was renamed as Jalan Masjid Negeri in Malay to commemorate the completion of Penang's new State Mosque along the road. However, this renaming exercise is not well-received by local Penangites, who still prefer to use the road's colonial name to this day. To accommodate the increase in vehicular traffic, a number of overpasses have been built and a stretch of Green Lane was widened to three lanes in 2015. However, traffic congestion along Green Lane remains a problem, especially during the rush hours.  Education  Green Lane is home to two missionary schools - Penang Free School and Convent Green Lane. In addition, the Penang Digital Library, the first library of its kind in Malaysia, is also located within the compounds of Penang Free School. cmglee Penang Free School main gate.jpgPenang Free School, the oldest English school in Southeast Asia, was relocated to Green Lane in 1928. Penang Digital Library, George Town, Penang.jpgThe Penang Digital Library was launched by the Penang state government in 2016. Mosquepg_2017.jpgGreen Lane was renamed Jalan Masjid Negeri after the Penang State Mosque along the road. cmglee_Penang_Cathedral_of_the_Holy_Spirit.jpgThe seat of the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Penang was moved to the Holy Spirit Cathedral in 2003. Health care A handful of private hospitals are situated along Green Lane. The most prominent of all is the Lam Wah Ee Hospital, at the junction with Jalan Tan Sri Teh Ewe Lim. Newer specialist centres along Green Lane include the Carl Corrynton Medical Centre and the Optimax Eye Specialist Hospital.  Places of worship  Several places of worship of various religions can be found along Green Lane, including the Penang State Mosque, the Malaysian Buddhist Meditation Centre, Wat Pinbang-Onn and the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit.

The cover featured an action shot from the 1994 NBA Finals. The game was published by EA Sports and released in October 1994. It introduced many elements that would become standard in the series, including the isometric on-court perspective, the \\"T-meter\\" for shooting free throws and the turbo button used to give players a temporary burst of speed. The game's engine came from a modified version of the engine used in EA Sports' FIFA International Soccer game, using the same perspective. The game was re-released with NBA Live 06 as part of the EA Retro Series. Game Players gave the Super NES version of this video game its \\"best sports game award\\" in their Super NES division on the January 1995 issue of their magazine.Game Players. January 1995. The game was the first Official NBA simulation to introduce the ability to create customized fictional teams and create copies of existing players, as well as a Create-a-Player function for users to make themselves in the game. It is also notable for being the first NBA video game to not feature Charles Barkley, as he began holding out on signing a licensing agreement due to the lack of pay to retired players from the NBAPA. NBA Live 95 was followed by NBA Live 96. Version differences The SNES version of the game featured the 1993-94 NBA rosters, while the Genesis version of the game featured the up-to-date 1994-95 rosters (minus most of the year's rookie class). Both versions featured limited roster management functions, however in the Genesis version, only players in the starting lineup could be traded. Additionally, there was no Create-a-Player function or a Free Agent pool to draw from. The PC release featured updated rosters accurate as of the 1994‚Äì95 season's trade deadline, and included the entire rookie class of 1994. Reception GamePro wrote of the SNES version that it \\"improves on last year's NBA Showdown with better graphics, more in- depth strategy, and more realistic game play.\\" They particularly praised the game's 30-degree-overhead court view, saying it allows players a better view of the action while allowing the game to run more smoothly. In February 1995, Famitsu magazine's Reader Cross Review gave the Super Famicom version of the game an 8 out of 10.Ë™≠ËÄÖ„ÇØ„É≠„Çπ„É¨„Éì„É•„Éº - NBA LIVE '95. Weekly Famitsu. No.323. Pg.39. 24 February 1995. GamePro also gave the Genesis version a generally positive review, though they commented that the cooperative multiplayer tends to be confusing. This time they made particular note of the fact that players take command of basketball players, coaches, and general managers, saying that this adds variety and depth to the gameplay. Next Generation reviewed the SNES version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"Live '95 emerges as the best basketball sim' available.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared the original NBA Live the 57th-best computer game ever released. The game is also notable for its success helping launch EA's other sports games. Both Madden NFL '95 and Triple Play Baseball outsold their competitors, NFL '95 and World Series Baseball, respectively, for the first time following NBA Live's release.

The mall was home to such stores as Gimbels, J.C. Penney, F.W. Woolworth Company, and Gee Bee Department Stores. The mall annex also included a two screen movie theater and auto repair center. Opening The Gimbels department store chain began construction on Eastland Mall in 1961. After approximately two years of construction and $12 million of construction costs, Eastland Shopping Plaza opened on August 15, 1963. In addition to a Gimbels, some of the nation's largest stores, J.C. Penney, National Record Mart, May-Stern, Kinney Shoes, Thom McAn, and F.W. Woolworth Company moved into the mall. The first store to open was the Thorofare super market located at the western end of the plaza. When Eastland Shopping Plaza opened, downtown McKeesport suffered as J.C. Penney moved from McKeesport into Eastland Shopping Plaza. Three other McKeesport retailers, Immel's, Wander Sales, and Richard's Shoes, opened stores in Eastland. At its peak in the 1960s, Eastland Shopping Plaza employed 800 people. Decline The upper level of Eastland was originally an open-air marketplace. After a fire destroyed much of the property and caused $1 million worth of damage on June 6, 1973, a roof was added and the entire mall was enclosed. At this time the \\"Shopping Plaza\\" in Eastland's name was changed to \\"Mall\\" and a Gee Bee discount store was opened. Just six years after its opening Eastland faced competition from all-enclosed Monroeville Mall, then billed as the largest mall in the United States, located under six miles (10 km) away. Four years earlier, Eastland saw competition from South Hills Village, the country's largest (and first two-story) enclosed mall, in Upper St. Clair and Bethel Park. Greengate Mall (now Greengate Centre) in nearby Greensburg, Westmoreland County would also open the very same year as South Hills Village. In 1979, Century III Mall, the third largest enclosed shopping center in the world (at that time), opened away in West Mifflin to further speed the decline of Eastland. Furthermore, whereas these four malls were located in and around more affluent suburbs, Eastland was located primarily around old mill towns. Many of these communities lost vast amounts of population during the lifetime of the Eastland Mall. Braddock, which East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Blvd leads directly into two miles (3 km) away, had approximately 12,000 residents in 1963. By the mall's close in 2005 it had fewer than 3,000. This demographic change took with it potential customers and employees of Eastland Mall. After Eastland Mall had already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, its most devastating blow came in September 1986 when Gimbels, which had developed and owned the mall, went out of business, taking most of Eastland's tenants along with it. Benderson Development Company of Buffalo, NY purchased the mall from the bankrupt Gimbels department store two years later. For the next 20 years Eastland tried to stay afloat with a variety of unique tenants - including a PennDOT state driver's license testing center, a beer distributor (Beer World, located in the old J.C. Penney's), a distribution center for Xerox, the local magistrate's office, a professional wrestling center (PWX, owned by James Miller), a bingo parlor (Eastland Social Hall Bingo), and a low power TV station, WBYD-CA. Most notable was the addition of a two-story indoor and spacious outdoor flea market in the space once occupied by Gimbels which, according to a flea market manager, drew 500 vendors and 2,000 customers per weekend at its peak. Many smaller retail stores then opened inside the mall, including Harper's Bazaar (a mom-and-pop women's clothing store run by Jim and Carol Harper), Kennywood Messenger Service (a notary and vehicle licensing service), Amer-a-Quick printing service, a barber shop, and a beauty parlor. The revival was temporary. In the 1990s, the flea market was moved off to the side in the old Gee Bee store, taking foot traffic away from the retail stores located inside the mall. The building then fell into a state of ruin. By the time the mall closed in 2005, it was only worth $1.38 million - less than the $1.4 million that Benderson Development Company paid for it 1988. By that point, trash cans holding water falling from the leaky roof abounded throughout the mall. Parts of the original Gimbels facade had collapsed and the walls were showing stress cracks. The walkway was no longer heated and the tiles were so broken and floor so uneven the heels of a shopper's shoes often caught in the floor. Two tenants survived for the entire 42-year life of the mall, Valley Shoe Repair and Marc Anthony's Hair Salon. Although some tenants supported keeping the mall open, North Versailles Township officials wanted to see the property cleared and replaced by new retail space or housing. It was also rumored that University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) purchased the property in order to centralize their Braddock and McKeesport hospital locations. After a year of sitting vacant, the mall, including the theater, was razed in early 2007. Benderson Development Company, the company who owned the Eastland property at the time had proposed building a multi-use complex on the site tentatively known as \\"Eastland Centre\\", although as of 2015*, the former mall site remains undeveloped and the Benderson website no longer has Eastland listed on its portfolio. *Update: 2020, it's still a vacant property.

It is a resident breeder in Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland, and a vagrant to Namibia. This species is found in subtropical open woodland, dry savanna, shrubland and suburban gardens. Taxonomy The fiscal flycatcher was previously the only member of the genus Sigelus but was moved to Melaenornis based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010. Description This black and white bird gets its name from its resemblance to the northern fiscal, a shrike. The fiscal flycatcher is 17‚Äì20 cm in length. The adult male is black above and white below with white wing patches and white sides to the tail. The female is brown, not black, above. The juvenile is like the female but duller and with brown spots and scalloping above and below. The song is a weak chittering, and the alarm call is tssisk. The male can be confused with the northern fiscal, but the shrike has a heavy hooked bill, a white patch on the shoulder rather than the lower wing, and has no white on its longer tail. The fiscal flycatcher is larger than the male collared flycatcher, which has a white collar and lacks white wing panels. Behaviour The fiscal flycatcher builds an open cup nest from thin stems and other plant material and lined with plant down. It is placed in a dense bush. The fiscal flycatcher feeds on insects, often taken in flight.

Early life Stephens was born in Bo'ness, on the Firth of Forth, Scotland; the son of John Stephens, the parish schoolmaster, and his wife Jane, n√©e Brunton. J. B. Stephens was educated at his father's school, then at a free boarding school and at the University of Edinburgh from 1849 to 1854 without obtaining a degree. For three years he was a travelling tutor on the continent, and from 1859 became a school teacher in Scotland. While teaching at Greenock Academy, Stephens wrote some minor verse and two short novels ('Rutson Morley' and 'Virtue Le Moyne') which were published in Sharpe's London Magazine in 1861‚Äì63. Career in Australia Stephens migrated to Queensland in 1866, possibly for health reasons. He was a tutor with the Barker family of squatters at Tamrookum station for some time and in 1870 entered the Queensland Education Department. He had experience as a teacher at Stanthorpe and was afterwards in charge of the school at Ashgrove, near Brisbane. Representations were then made to the premier, Sir Thomas McIlwraith, that a man of Stephens's ability was being wasted in a small school, and in 1883 a position was found for him as a correspondence clerk in the colonial secretary's department. He afterwards rose to be undersecretary to the chief secretary's department. Before coming to Australia Stephens had done a little writing for popular magazines, and in 1871 his first volume of poems, Convict Once, was published by Macmillan and Company, which immediately proclaimed him to be an Australian poet of importance. In 1873 a long poem, The Godolphin Arabian, was published. These were followed by The Black Gin and other Poems, 1873, and Miscellaneous Poems, 1880. The first collected edition of his poems was published in 1885, others followed in 1888, 1902 and 1912. Of these the 1902 edition is the most complete. After Stephens entered the colonial secretary's department in 1883 he was unable (or did not have the financial pressure) to do much literary work though he wrote occasionally for the press. Poetic critique Stephens was a man of medium height \\"with the face of a poet\\". Simple and natural in manner, he was modest about his own work. His over-sensitiveness to the sufferings of others made it difficult for him to resist appeals for charity to the extent of damaging his own fortunes. He was sometimes exuberant and full of humour, though occasionally the pendulum swung the other way. His sense of duty kept him working during his last illness. No doubt Stephens's official papers exercised his literary talent, but from a creative standpoint his employment in the civil service was perhaps not the best use of his time, and he wrote little verse in later years. However, though new men were arising, he remained the representative man of letters in Australia until his death. His humorous output is, at its best, very good. Despite all changes of fashion, such Stephens poems as \\"The Power of Science\\" and \\"My other Chinese Cook\\" can still evoke laughter. The Godolphin Arabian in the metre and style of Byron's Beppo goes on its pleasant rhyming way for about three thousand lines and is still readable, but as it is not included in any collected edition, it has been almost wholly forgotten. Convict Once remains one of the few long Australian poems of merit, and in a technical sense it constitutes a lesson to those writers who mistakenly think that writing in a long metre is easy. Much of Stephens's other verse is admirable in its simplicity and dignity. His poems on federation ‚Äì \\"The Dominion of Australia\\" and \\"The Dominion\\" ‚Äì are among his most notable productions. At least eighteen of his published poems have unmistakably Australian themes and settings: \\"Fulfilment\\", \\"Cape Byron\\", \\"A Coin of Trajan in Australia\\", \\"A Lost Chance\\", \\"Adelaide Ironside\\", \\"Australian Anthem\\", \\"Opening Hymn\\", \\"Drought and Doctrine\\", \\"Marsupial Bill\\", \\"A Piccaninny\\", \\"To a Black Gin\\", \\"New Chum and Old Monarch\\", \\"The Great Pig Story of the Tweed\\", \\"A Son of the Soil\\", \\"Big Ben\\", \\"The Southern Cross\\", \\"A Brisbane Reverie\\" and \\"Convict Once\\".The Poetical Works of Brunton Stephens, Angus and Robertson 1902 \\"The Dominion\\" was quoted in Sir Henry Parkes' 'Tenterfield Oration', an 1889 speech calling for the federation of Australia. Apart from his poetry, he published a short novel, A Hundred Pounds and the libretto of an opera. A few poetry pamphlets not already mentioned are listed in Percival Serle's Bibliography of Australasian Poetry and Verse. Later life  On 10 November 1876 Stephens had married Rosalie Mary Donaldson (1846‚Äì1932), and they had five children, Jessie Mary (1877‚Äì1945), Mary (1879‚Äì1961), Hubert (1881‚Äì), Rachael Catherine (1883‚Äì1967), and Georgina (1886‚Äì1961). In September 1878, Stephens became a founding member and an early president of the famed literary Johnsonian Club, Brisbane; 'an institution being the association of pressmen, artists, actors, and scientists'. He was suffering for some time from angina pectoris before his death on 29 June 1902. His funeral was held the next day and proceeded from Wyuna, his residence on Water Street at Highgate Hill, to the South Brisbane Cemetery. Stephens was buried in the same joint plot as his parents- in-law, Thomas Willet Donaldson (c. 1810‚Äì1875) and Barbara Donaldson (c. 1814‚Äì1898), and survived by his wife, four daughters, and one son. His wife, and three daughters (Jessie, Mary and Georgina) were later interred in the family plot.

The PC and PlayStation covers features Shaquille O'Neal of the Orlando Magic, while the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis box covers show a photo of the tip-off to Game 1 of the 1995 NBA Finals. The game was published by EA Sports and released on November 30, 1995. The PlayStation and PC versions were the first games in the series to feature a 3D rendered court, allowing for multiple camera angles using EA's \\"Virtual Stadium\\" technology (also used by FIFA Soccer 96). The on-court player graphics remained 2D sprites. It was also the first NBA Live game released for the PlayStation. NBA Live 96 is followed by NBA Live 97. Notes * Live 96 introduced the Free Agent pool and Create-a-Player to the series. The create-a-player feature was left out of the PlayStation version in order to meet the deadline for the game's release. * The first NBA Live to utilize Virtual Stadium Technology and multiple camera angles. * Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley were not included due to licensing issues. They did however exist as hidden players in the console version of the game. Players could unlock them by entering their surnames (along with the surnames of various legends and rookies from the draft class of 1995) in Create-a-Player. Development The player sprites were rendered on Silicon Graphics workstations. Reception A review of the Genesis version in Next Generation gave strong approval to the game's new features, particularly the post-up move and the create-a-player feature. They gave the game a perfect five out of five stars, concluding, \\"While the action and graphics in Slam 'N' Jam ... for 3DO are still superior, NBA Live '96 for the Genesis is the best basketball simulation out there, anywhere.\\" Next Generation gave the SNES version a reduced score of four out of five stars, explaining that \\"the game's essential lack of defensive play and offensive strategy make this cart pale in comparison to Genesis' version as a simulator.\\" The reviewer elaborated that in the SNES version the player can easily score with repeated dunks, and concluded that the game, though the best SNES basketball game yet released, pales against the Genesis version. They later named the Genesis version number 76 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\". Johnny Ballgame of GamePro said the SNES version \\"is bigger and badder than previous versions on the SNES, and it's the first to be comparable to the acclaimed Genesis versions of the past.\\" He praised the new features, excellent controls, improved graphics, and \\"jammin' soundtrack\\". He found the Genesis version inferior to the SNES version with its smaller sprites, fewer colors, and less smooth opening music, but still outstanding in absolute terms. Johnny Ballgame was less enamored of the PlayStation version, stating that the removal of the create-a-player feature seen in earlier versions of the game, the substandard graphics, and the erratic camera make it an overall mediocre effort. He particularly remarked that the game fails to measure up to NBA ShootOut, which was released in the same month. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed that the graphics were not up to PlayStation standards, but maintained it to be the best basketball game then on the market. They gave it scores of 9.0 and 8.5 out of 10. A reviewer for Next Generation also felt it was better than NBA ShootOut, praising its vast array of options, features, and plays, though he criticized the unrealistic physics. He gave it four out of five stars, concluding, \\"Even EA admits that as far as technically innovative basketball games go, it's way behind Sony Interactive, Konami, even Crystal Dynamics. But when it comes to gameplay, NBA Live '96 is the most consuming basketball game on the market.\\" In 1996, Next Generation listed NBA Live 96 as number 76 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"none do a better job than NBA Live '96 at managing to balance the offensive nature of the sport while incorporating the important defensive and strategic elements.\\" References Category:1995 video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:National Basketball Association video games Category:EA Sports games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:DOS games Category:Windows games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Game Boy games Category:Tiertex Design Studios games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games set in 1995 Category:Video games set in 1996 ru:NBA Live 96 ","title":"NBA Live 96"},{"id":"10960626","text":"NBA Live 97 is the third installment of the NBA Live video games series.

Audio commentary was provided by Al Murdoch and Ernie Johnson Jr. Producer Tarrnie Williams Jr. (son of Tarrnie Williams Sr.) explained the decision to have the series switch from using sprites to polygonal models for the players: Reception Most reviews for the original release on PlayStation were highly positive. Critics praised the dramatic improvement in graphics and animation over the previous installment, the large number of options, the exhaustive playbook, and the custom jerseys created through the create-a-player feature. A reviewer for Next Generation mentioned most of these merits but was a dissenting voice against the game, commenting that \\"The super-slow gameplay just accentuates the basic flaws in a dying engine that desperately needs to be revamped. ... If you can get past the poor control and slow play, NBA Live '97 is extremely deep and beautiful to watch. Unfortunately, it's just not fun like it used to be.\\" On the other side, Joe Rybicki of Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"a great game that will excite NBA Live fans\\", Tom Ham of GameSpot said \\"Boasting lightning-fast gameplay, tons of moves, great artificial intelligence, textured polygon players, and motion capture animation, NBA Live 97 may very well be the best Playstation-based basketball game to date\\", and Johnny Ballgame of GamePro gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and funfactor), concluding that \\"you won't find a more complete, dynamic, and in-your-face basketball game on the 32-bit market than Live '97.\\" Johnny Ballgame gave similar praises to the Genesis version, calling it \\"the quintessential basketball title on the Genesis.\\" Dr. Zombie reviewed the Super NES version in the same issue. While he gave it slightly lower scores than the Genesis version in sound, control, and funfactor, his review was relentlessly positive and similarly called it \\"the best SNES b-ball action ever.\\" NBA Live 97 was a finalist for the Computer Game Developers Conference's 1996 \\"Best Sports Game\\" Spotlight Award, but lost the prize to NHL 97. It was also nominated as Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1996 sports game of the year, although it lost to Links LS. The later Saturn version was much less well-received. Critics still praised the wide range of options and features, but reported the graphics and frame rate are greatly inferior to the PlayStation version's, to the point where it is sometimes difficult to follow the action. GamePros The Rookie maintained that \\"the addictive gameplay makes up for any lack of detail in Live '97s overall look.\\" While acknowledging that the core gameplay is good, Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine felt that the issues with the animation, and additionally the speed decrease resulting from poor PAL conversion and the load times when accessing and closing menus, cut into the enjoyment too much. Dean Mortlock devoted most of his review in Saturn Power to arguing that it is ludicrous to release a basketball video game in the United Kingdom since the sport has very little following in that country. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked the PlayStation version the 33rd best console video game of all time, commenting that \\"No other basketball game comes close in playability and realism.\\" They noted the omission of the Saturn version from the ranking as deliberate, since it \\"isn't nearly as good.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Notes * Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley appear as \\"Roster Players\\" as they could not be included due to licensing issues. * Kobe Bryant makes his video game debut in this game as a part of the Los Angeles Lakers. * Live 97 was the first game to feature a 15 player roster. The PC version also features 100 Create-a-Player slots. * Expanding upon the trivia included in Live 96, Live 97 featured audio \\"Cool Facts\\" for prominent NBA players.

Gengadharan Nair is a Malaysian High Court judge and prior to that a prominent lawyer specialising in industrial law. Early life Genga, as he was known to all, was born on 30 April 1944 in Kuala Lumpur. He was one of three children born to C.R. Nair and Lakshmi Kutty Amma. As many from his generation who became lawyers, Genga was first a school teacher, trained at Brinsford Lodge in Liverpool and on his return, served in a number of schools, including the prestigious Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur. He quickly became active in union activities. Legal and Judicial Career In 1968, he quit teaching and left for London to read law at the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar after securing a Second Class degree in his first attempt at the Bar examinations. On his return to Malaysia in 1972, Genga did his pupilage at the law firm of Xavier and Vadiveloo, a firm specialising in industrial law. He was admitted as an Advocate and Solicitor of the High Court of Malaya in June 1973. With the late D.P. Xavier as his mentor, Genga established himself as an expert in industrial law. In all his years in practice, Genga only represented trade unions and the employees, eschewing the more lucrative briefs of employers and employer associations. He was committed to the advancement of labour rights As a member of the Malaysian Bar, he was for many years a member of the Industrial Court of Rules and Practice Committee of the Bar Council and sat on the Bar Council‚Äôs Special Committee on Review of Chambering in 2002. In 1988, Genga and his partners, N. Mahalingam and Wong Lu Peen established the firm of Genga Maha Wong & Co (later known as Genga Maha & Peri) with the address Room 302, 3rd Floor, Bangunan NUBE, 114 Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, 50100 Kuala Lumpur. When Genga was appointed Judicial Commissioner in 2003, many, especially lawyers, who have appeared before him felt that the elevation should have been made much earlier. He showed that appeared before him that, when properly attended, litigation as developed in the common law courts was one of the finest arts for conflict resolution available to man. In the High Court in Johor Bahru, where he first heard his cases, he earned the respect of lawyers. The Court of Appeal had no difficulties in affirming his decisions. He is also widely quoted for his judgements relating to criminal matters. In, PP V. Mohd. Abbas Danus Baksan [2004] 7 CLJ 249, he stated as follows: ‚ÄúIt is, in my humble view, quite clear that the accused was merely trying to tailor his defence in an attempt to create doubts about the prosecution‚Äôs case knowing full well, having opted to give his evidence in the form of an unsworn statement from the dock that his story cannot be tested by cross examination. The end result of his statement is just a mere denial and assertions not supported by evidence. It is trite that mere denial without other proof to reasonably dislodge the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to inject reasonable doubt into the prosecutions‚Äô case'\\" In PP v Jessica Lim Lu Ping & Anor [2004] 2 CLJ 763, he made this pertinent observation:- Despite decades of sentencing by the Malaysian courts no golden rule has yet evolved in the sentencing of accused persons following a conviction in criminal cases. Neither have the courts evolved a cast iron formula to be followed in sentencing. However, there has always been a general flexible principle that all courts have a flexible and free discretion to be exercised judicially and with a judicial conscience in deciding the period in which a guilty criminal will be incarcerated in prison. Nonetheless, our courts have evolved a general flexible rule propounded through numerous decided cases that where an accused person pleads guilty without contesting the charge or charges against him in a trial which might consume many days, involving prosecutors, witnesses, documents, police officers and chemists the courts lean in favour of imposing a reduced sentence. A \\"plea of guilty\\" achieves the disposal of a criminal case with lightning speed. Every contest and trial leads to a backlog of undisposed criminal cases clogging the courts and the prisons with remand prisoners. It is in the public interest that pending criminal cases be disposed off as expeditiously as possible and accused persons who plead guilty be imposed with a reduced sentence. Honesty is an universal obligation and a reduced sentence encourages honesty when an accused pleads guilty, the end result being that more accused persons would willingly admit guilt without a trial, thus, reducing the workload of the prosecutor's office and the clearance of the backlog of cases. Family and Social Service In 1976, he married Devagey Raru. A son, Sashikharan was born in 1982. Despite a busy schedule, Genga always made time for the family. He always spent his preciously limited time to community service. For many year, until his appointment as a judge, he was an active and respected member of the Rotary Club of Damansara. Genga died on 21 April 2007http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/in_memoriam/the_malaysian_bar_mourns_justice_gengadharans_demise.html at the Subang Jaya Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya following a short illness and was cremated the day after.http://www.thestar.com.my/Story/?file=%2F2007%2F4%2F23%2Fnation%2F17519681&sec;=nation References Category:1944 births Category:Malaysian lawyers Category:Malaysian judges Category:Malayali people Category:Malaysian people of Indian descent Category:Living people Category:Malaysian Hindus ","title":"Gengadharan Nair"},{"id":"10960690","text":"Reverend Father Dr. Vincent Kwabena Damuah (April 1930 ‚Äì August 1992) was a Catholic priest, theologian and politician in Ghana. He was a member of the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) government and was also the founder of the Afrikania Mission. He was also referred to as Os…îfo Ok…îmfo Damuah. Dr. Dumuah received a Ph.D. in African Studies from Howard University in 1971.He was the first Ghanaian Catholic priest who diverted back to practice the African traditional religion and help in writing the first African Scriptures called EDU. He formed the African religious group called the Afrikian Mission which is widely based in South Africa,he championed the Africa Spiritual emancipation. Priesthood Rev. Father Damuah was a Roman Catholic priest from 1957 to 1982. He was once a consultant of Afro-American Affairs in the diocese of Pittsburgh in the United States. He returned to Ghana in 1976. He was suspended from his priestly ministry by the Catholic Church, because of his involvement with the PNDC government. In December 1982, Rev. Damuah founded the Afrikania Mission, an organization devoted to the promotion of African Traditional Religion. Politics Rev. Damuah was detained during the Nkrumah era. This was for criticising the Convention People's Party government for the deportation of Bishop Reginald Richard Roseveare, the then Anglican Bishop of Accra. He was released following the personal intervention of Archbishop John Kodwo Amissah, Catholic Archbishop of Cape Coast During the four month rule of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in 1979, he was on record to have supported the executions, which included three former heads of state of Ghana, although the Christian Council of Ghana opposed it. He wrote: > We do not love those executed less but we love our country more. Why all the > fuss about execution? I believe that the A.F.R.C has the right to exact > capital punishment for the common good of the country. We hope and pray that > the number is not too large. Christ died on the cross to save mankind. We > hope and pray that those who have to die, accept the challenge courageously > and prayerfully to save Ghana.The Standard, Sunday 29th July , 1979, p.3. Rev. Damuah was appointed a member of the PNDC on 2 January 1982. This led to his suspension by the Catholic Church from his priestly duties. He had however resigned from government by late 1982.

Early life Alakbar was born in Baku, into the large family of a small businessman- shopkeeper. Although there were no artists in his family, Rezaguliyev showed artistic talent at an early age. He studied at Moscow Technical Art College from 1925 to 1928.\\"Art As Memory, Alakbar Rezaguliyev's Prints of Azerbaijan\\" by Jean Patterson, in Azerbaijan International (Autumn 2002), Vol. 10:3, pp. 32-37 After graduation, he returned to Baku. Years in exile Alakbar was among the first to be arrested in what would later be termed as Stalin's Repression, in which 70,000 Azerbaijanis were executed or exiled along with hundreds of thousands of other citizens throughout the USSR. His friend was accused of advocating \\"pan-Turkish ideas,\\" and Alakbar was deemed guilty by mere association. When Alakbar was thrown into prison, he didn't even know what he was being accused of or why. Altogether, Alakbar spent more than 23 years of his life in exile.Street Scenes from Yesteryear, The Prints of Alakbar Rezaguliyev in Azerbaijan International (Summer 2000), Vol. 8:2, pp. 16-17. He was sentenced to six years. After being released, he returned and married Sona Huseynova in 1935; the couple had two daughters, Adila and Sevil. He and Sona later divorced. On November 3, 1937, again Alakbar was arrested. He told his fellow artist Rasim Babayev how it happened: \\"One day I was walking down Komsomolskaya Street when I ran into Ruhulla Akhundov (one of the Bolsheviks who helped establish the Soviet system in Azerbaijan). \\"Ruhulla looked annoyed at seeing me and remarked rudely: 'Hey, you dumb guy, are you back here again?' And with those words, I was sent directly back to prison\\" - this time, to Siberia and later on to Solovki, an island in the Arctic where there are monasteries. Alakbar would go on to do a series of paintings depicting the isolation of those years there. During his exile, Alakbar married a German girl named Berta, who had been sent to Siberia from a German settlement in the Saratov Autonomous Region. When World War II broke out, Joseph Stalin had exiled all Germans living in the Soviet Union. Alakbar and Berta had two sons, Ogtay and Aydin, and a daughter, Sevda. After Exile After Stalin died in 1953, tens of thousands of prisoners were released from prison. Alakbar, too, was among those who eventually were able to return to Azerbaijan. The exile greatly affected his personality. He became very serious and morally broken. It even affected his creative activity. He very seldom used colors after returning home. The harsh experiences of imprisonment that he had suffered for more than two decades, after all, had been his fate merely through association and not based on any crime that he had ever committed himself.

Semu () is the name of a caste established by the Yuan dynasty. The Semu categories refers to people who come from Central and West Asia, it is told that there are 31 categories among them. They had come to serve the Yuan dynasty by enfranchising under the dominant Mongol caste. The Semu were not a self-defined and homogeneous ethnic group per se, but one of the four castes of the Yuan dynasty: the Mongols, Semu (or Semuren), the \\"Han\\" (Hanren in Chinese, or all subjects of the former Jin dynasty, Dali Kingdom and Koreans) and the Southerners (Nanren in Chinese, or all subjects of the former Southern Song dynasty; sometimes called Manzi). Among the Semu were Buddhist Turpan Uyghurs, Tanguts and Tibetans; Nestorian Christian tribes like the Ongud; Alans; Muslim Central Asian Persian and Turkic peoples including the Khwarazmians and Karakhanids; West Asian Arab, Jewish and other minor groups who are from even further west. Name Contrary to popular belief among both non-Chinese and Chinese, the term \\"Semu\\" (interpreted literally as \\"color-eye\\") did not imply that caste members had \\"colored eyes\\" and it was not a physical description of the people it labelled. It in fact meant \\"assorted categories\\" (ÂêÑËâ≤ÂêçÁõÆ, g√® s√® m√≠ng m√π), emphasizing the ethnic diversity of Semu people. Classification The Semu categories are pointed to people who come from Central and West Asia by Yuan dynasty, it is told that there are 31 categories among them. They had come to serve the Yuan dynasty by enfranchising under the dominant Mongol caste. The Semu were not a self-defined and homogeneous ethnic group per se, but one of the four castes of the Yuan dynasty: the Mongols, Semu (or Semuren), the \\"Han\\" (Hanren in Chinese, or all subjects of the former Jin dynasty, Dali Kingdom and Koreans) and the Southerners (Nanren in Chinese, or all subjects of the former Southern Song dynasty; sometimes called Manzi). Among the Semu were Buddhist Turpan Uyghurs, Tanguts and Tibetans; Nestorian Christian tribes like the Ongud; Alans; Muslim Central Asian Persian and Turkic peoples including the Khwarazmians and Karakhanids; West Asian Jewish and other minor groups who are from even further Europe. Islam was not the religion of the Uighurs during the Mongol Empire. The Uighur land itself was not Muslim inhabited while the Muslim lands were towards its west. They were Nestorian, Manichaeans, and Buddhist, and by Mongol times the Buddhists and Nestorians absorbed the Manichaeans, and Buddhist clerics dominated the Mongol employed educated sector of their own population. The '\\"Compendium of the Turkic Dialects\\" by Mahmud al-Kashgari, included among the infidels, the Uighurs. It was written \\"just as the thorn should be cut at its root, so the Uighur should be struck on the eye\\" by Kashgari, who viewed them as untrustworthy and noted that Muslim Turks used the derogatory name \\"Tat\\" against the Buddhist Uighurs whom Kashgari described as \\"infidels\\". The identities of \\"Buddhist\\" and \\"Uyghur\\" were intertwined with each other. While administratively classified as Semu, many of these groups rather referred to themselves by their self-aware ethnic identities in everyday life, such as Uyghur. Muslims, Persians, Karakhanids and Khwarazmians in particular, were actually mistaken to be Uyghurs or at least, \\"from the land of the Uyghurs\\". Therefore, they adopted the label conferred to them by the Chinese: \\"Huihui\\", which was a corruption of the name Uyghur, but at the same time distinguishable from the name reserved for Buddhist Turpan Uyghurs proper, \\"Weiwuer\\". Of the many ethnic groups classified as \\"Semu\\" during the Yuan, only the Muslim Hui managed to survive into the Ming period as a large collective identity with self-awareness of common identity spanning across the whole China. Other ethnic groups were either small and confined to limited localities (such as the Buddhist Turpan Uyghurs in Wuling, Hunan, and the Kaifeng Jews), or were forced to assimilate into the Han Chinese or Muslim Huis (such as some Christian and Jewish Semu in the Northwest, who, though thoroughly Islamicized, still unto this day retain peculiar labels like \\"Black Cap/Doppa Huihui\\", \\"Blue Cap Huihui\\"). The historian Frederick W. Mote wrote that the usage of the term \\"social classes\\" for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the 4 class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth, but just entailed \\"degrees of privilege\\" to which they were entitled institutionally and legally so a person's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing, since there were rich and well socially standing Chinese while there were less rich Mongol and Semu than there were Mongol and Semu who lived in poverty and were ill-treated.Mote 2003, p. 492. The reason for the order of the classes and the reason why people were placed in a certain class was the date they surrendered to the Mongols, and had nothing to do with their ethnicity. The earlier they surrendered to the Mongols, the higher they were placed, the more the held out, the lower they were ranked. The Northern Chinese were ranked higher and Southern Chinese were ranked lower because southern China withstood and fought to the last before caving in.ed. Zhao 2007, p. 265.Bakhit 2000, p. 426. Major commerce during this era gave rise to favorable conditions for private southern Chinese manufacturers and merchants.Ford 1991, p. 29. When the Mongols placed the Uighurs of the Kingdom of Qocho over the Koreans at the court the Korean King objected, then the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan rebuked the Korean King, saying that the Uighur King of Qocho was ranked higher than the Karluk Kara-Khanid ruler, who in turn was ranked higher than the Korean King, who was ranked last, because the Uighurs surrendered to the Mongols first, the Karluks surrendered after the Uighurs, and the Koreans surrendered last, and that the Uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting.ed. Rossabi 1983, p. 247.Haw 2014, p. 4. Koreans were ranked as Han people along with northern Chinese. Japanese historians like Uematsu, Sugiyama and Morita criticized the perception that a four class system existed under Mongol rule and Funada Yoshiyuki questioned the very existence of the Semu as a class.Funada 2010, pp. 1-21. The Yuan dynasty \\"Han people\\" classification included Koreans, Bohais, Jurchens and Khitans, and they are included in statistics of intermarriage between Semu and \\"Han people\\". Semu and Han intermarried with Mongols. The Haluhu (ÂìàÂâåÈ≤Å) Semu married Koreans, Uighurs Tangwu, Mongols and Han during Yuan rule. Tibetan, Qincha, Uighur, Hui Hui, and Han intermarried with Korean women during the Yuan dynasty. Korean women married Indian, Uyghur, and Turkic Semu men. This intermarriage of Korean women and Semu men was extensive in China during the Yuan dynasty. A rich merchant from the Ma'bar Sultanate, Abu Ali (P'aehali) Â≠õÂìàÈáå (or Â∏ÉÂìàÁàæ Buhaer), was associated closely with the Ma'bar royal family. After falling out with them, he moved to Yuan dynasty China and received a Korean woman as his wife and a job from the Mongol Emperor, the woman was formerly Ê°ëÂì• Sangha's wife and her father was Ëî°‰ªÅÊèÜ Ï±ÑÏÜ°ÎÖÑ Ch'ae In'gyu during the reign of Âø†ÁÉà Chungnyeol of Goryeo, recorded in the Dongguk Tonggam, Goryeosa and ÁïôÂ§¢ÁÇé Liu Mengyan's ‰∏≠‰ø∫ÈõÜ Zhong'anji.

Zhuhu Huihui was a name for the Jews. Lineages ÈõÅÈó®Ëê®Ê∞è) Among the Huihui, or Hui, there were in fact Muslim lineages that have migrated to China via Central Asia or by sea route prior to the Yuan migration of merchants, adventurers, craftsmen and service men from the Muslim world to China. These Muslims were not previously known as Hui, but have come to associate themselves with the \\"Muslims from the land of the Khwarezem\\" by the mere fact of common religious identity. \\"Hui\\" has thus become synonymous with the Islamic religion in the Chinese language since the Ming period (but not before that). Besides identifying themselves as Huis, the Semu Muslims of the Yunnan province, especially those descended from the Khwarazmian statesman Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, or Sayyid Ajjal, came to be labeled as Panthay wherever they migrated to in Southeast Asia, including Myanmar and Thailand. This name Panthay is particular to the Yunnan Huis and is not shared by Huis in other parts of China such as Fujian and Ningxia. Zheng He is probably the best-known Panthay Hui in the West. The learned Semu, including scribes, interpreters and statesmen who served the Mongol military class, were known for their contributions to Chinese literature and sciences. Many of them became masters of Chinese poetry and also helped compose state-commissioned historical works on previous dynasties. Their privileged position in the Yuan bureaucracy was in part due to the Mongol military class's distrust of the native Khitay and Manji subjects. One such Yuan Semu mandarin and poet was Guan Yunshi, a Turk of disputed origin. Soldiers After the fall of the Yuan, many Semu intellectuals and soldiers, due to their less entrenched loyalty to the Mongols, also became quickly assimilated into the Ming political culture and became prominent mandarins and aristocrats. Some no longer retained separate ethnic identity and became Han Chinese, others still served the Ming court as Muslim Huis. The Ming court's tolerance for loyal Muslims and respect for their practices and ethnic identity partially explains the strength and vitality of the Muslim Hui community in modern China, compared to other Semu groups such as the Christians and Jews. Similar practices in other areas of the Mongol Empire Bukhara and Samarqand were visited by Changchun. At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara and Samarqand in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. The surname of Li was held by one of Yelu Ahai's staff of Han Chinese. There were various Chinese craftsmen. Tangut, Khitan and Han Chinese took control over gardens and fields from the Muslims. Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called \\"Right Alan Guard\\" which was combined with \\"recently surrendered\\" soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih). After the Mongol conquest by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them. The Mongol appointed Governor of Samarqand was a Qara-Khitay (Khitan), held the title Taishi, familiar with Chinese culture his name was Ahai. Muslims viewed Chagatai Khan with negativity and hostility because Chagatai Khan strictly enforced Mongol Yasa law against Islamic Shariah law banning Halal animal slaughter and Islamic prayer ritual ablution as well as the Islamic legal system. The Uyghur steward Vajir was accused of poisoning Chagatai Khan to death in 1242 by his wife Yisulun. Han Chinese officials and colonists were sent by the Mongol Yuan dynasty to areas of Lingbei province (ÂíåÂÆÅË∑Ø ÁõäËò≠Â∑û Ë¨ôÂ∑û).History of Yuan „Ää ÂÖÉÂè≤ „ÄãÔºå The 1258 Baghdad siege involved a Chinese officer. Each of Eurasia's ends saw their specialists moved to the other end under the Mongols. The Yenisei area had a community of weavers of Chinese origin and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Chinese origin seen by Changchun. Discrimination Yuan dynasty Genghis Khan and the following Yuan emperors forbade Islamic practices like Halal butchering, forcing Mongol methods of butchering animals on Muslims, and other restrictive degrees continued. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret. Genghis Khan directly called Muslims and Jews \\"slaves\\", and demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal method. Circumcision was also forbidden. Jews were also affected, and forbidden by the Mongols to eat Kosher. Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim Generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim Generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had the name in Chinese which meant \\"barracks\\" and also mean \\"thanks\\"; many Hui Muslims claim it is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was named in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding. After the massacre, the remaining Jews and Muslims escaped. Some were back to their own country, but some like Jews escaped to Guangdong. Ming dynasty After expelling the Mongols, the Ming dynasty was soon founded. Because of the Semu's help, some of them were being employed into the central government. However, the Ming dynasty enforced assimilation to Chinese customs, such as banning used their own languages, customs, names and instead switching to speaking Chinese and using Chinese names and intermarrying with Han people. Both Mongol and Central Asian Semu Muslim women and men were required by Ming Code to marry Han Chinese after the first Ming Emperor Hongwu passed the law in Article 122. The aim for it is to reduce Semu's population since Semu was in the second class in Yuan and used to help the Mongols. Some Hui claim that the order was secretly done by the Ming Hongwu Emperor to protect them from attacks since they stood out while they thought Zhu was a Hui too. Indeed, Zhu was not a Hui while at that time only the Semu used this name. But in the middle period of Ming Dynasty, the royalties separated Semu into different groups while the groups as Muslims and Tibetans were still many. The Islam and Tibetan religions have survived until today. But the minority groups such as Jews, most of their customs were no more, leaving them into the Han group. This separation continued until the establishment of the Republic of China. Although the Communist Party of China founded the People's Republic, Chinese are scientifically separated into more groups which is now determined to be as many as 56 different ethnic groups. Some people claim that this number is higher than the periods before. The new separation doesn't mean there are only 56 ethnic groups. This list doesn't include small populations like Jewish. Even if such ethnicities are so few in numbers, they still continue to exist in China. The Ming dynasty allowed Islam and Judaism to be practiced and issued edicts that said they conformed to Confucianism while it banned religions such as Nestorian Christianity, Manicheanism and the White Lotus sect. Nestorian Christianity and Manicheanism died out during the Ming dynasty while Islam and Judaism were protected. Around 1376 the 30-year-old Chinese merchant Lin Nu visited Ormuz in Persia, converted to Islam, and married a Semu girl (‚ÄúÂ®∂Ëâ≤ÁõÆÂ•≥‚Äù) (either a Persian or an Arab girl) and brought her back to Quanzhou in Fujian.Li Guang-qi, ‚ÄúLi-shi shi-xi tu‚Äù (Genealogical list of the Li lineage), in Rong-shah Li-shi zu-pu (Genealogy of the Li lineage of Rong-shan), ms., Quan-zhou, 1426.

Central Asian women were provided to the Zhengde Emperor by a Muslim guard and Sayyid Hussein from Hami. The guard was Yu Yung and the women were Uighur. It is unknown who really was behind the anti-pig slaughter edict. The speculation of him becoming a Muslim is remembered alongside his excessive and debauched behavior along with his concubines of foreign origin.

It is unusual as a shade-tolerant member of a mostly sun-loving genus. Jumpseed is a perennial, named for its seeds which can \\"jump\\" several feet when a ripe seedpod is disturbed. Persicaria virginiana blooms in midsummer to late summer/early fall. It has a stalk of small white flowers. Description Like other Persicaria, jumpseed has alternate leaves, with fine-hairy stipular sheaths (ocrea) with bristle-fringed edges which often turn brownish. Flowers, widely spaced along slender stalks, are white to greenish-white, rarely pink- tinged, and fruiting flowers have 2 downward-pointing hook-tipped styles. Persicaria virginiana is easily distinguished from most other Persicaria species by its much larger, more oval-shaped leaves, although a few species also have large leaves. It sometimes has a chevron-shaped marking on the leaves; often a single plant will have this marking on some leaves but not others. Cultivars and naturalized populations from cultivation show much greater variation than wild-type plants, sometimes having variegation or have more involved red patterning, and sometimes having red or pink flowers. Distribution and habitat Persicaria virginiana has a wide native range throughout most of Eastern North America, from Ontario and Quebec, south to Florida, and west as far as Texas, Nebraska, and Minnesota. It naturally occurs in full to partial shade, on riverbanks, woods, cliffs, and rocks. Cultivation Many variegated cultivars exist. The plant prefers medium to moist soil and full sun to part shade.

The use of the word \\"ox\\" in this context is a legacy of nomenclature; no specialized stock of beef animals are used and tails may come from bovines other than oxen. It is believed by some that oxtail soup was invented in Spitalfields in London in the seventeenth century by French Huguenot and Flemish immigrants, from the tails of animals. Different versions of oxtail soup exist: Korean, Chinese, a fried/barbecued oxtail combined with soup variation which is a popular dish in Indonesia where it is called as sop buntut. An ethnic dish of the American South which traces its lineage back to the pre-revolutionary war era, and a thick, rich, gravy-like soup popular in the United Kingdom since the 18th century. Creole oxtail soup is made from a tomato base with oxtails, potatoes, green beans, corn, mirepoix, garlic, and herbs and spices.  Chinese oxtail soup  Though translated literally as \\"oxtail soup\\" (ÁâõÂ∞æÊ±§ Ni√∫wƒõi tƒÅng), this version of the dish is somewhere between a soup and a stew. One of the defining characteristics of oxtail soup is that it contains a large mass of solid ingredients, rather than ingredients that have been diced or shredded as is the norm with Chinese soup. Chunks of oxtail, potato, carrots, cabbage, tomato, and mushrooms are mixed in water, and salted to taste. The mixture should be heated at a slow boil, to allow time for the ingredients to release their flavors. In particular, the tomatoes and potatoes should largely disintegrate into the water, giving the broth a reddish-orange coloration and thickening it. As to be expected, oils from the oxtail lend most of the flavor. The soup is served with all of the ingredients.  Indonesian oxtail soup  Indonesian sop buntut In Indonesian cuisine, oxtail soup () is a popular dish. It is made of slices of fried or barbecued oxtail, served with vegetables in a rich but clear beef broth. It contains boiled potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, leek, celery, fried shallots and dried black mushrooms. Indonesian sop buntut is seasoned with shallot, garlic and native spices such as black pepper, nutmeg, and clove. A relatively new variant is called sop buntut goreng (fried oxtail soup), where the oxtail is seasoned, fried and served dry; the soup is served in a separate bowl. The dish is commonly eaten with rice and accompanied by sambal, sweet soy sauce and lime juice. Some restaurants specialize in oxtail soup, among them the famous Bogor Caf√© in the Hotel Borobudur in Central Jakarta. Korean oxtail soup  Korean kkori- gomtang Korean oxtail soup, called kkori-gomtang (), is a type of gomguk (beef bone soup). It is colloquially known as \\"bone soup\\". The broth is made with raw oxtail, garlic, salt, black pepper, green onions and other typical Korean flavors. The soup must be simmered at low heat for several hours to soften the meat and make the broth. During this time, the layer of fat must be regularly skimmed from the surface of the pot and discarded. The final result is a rich beef broth with a garlic taste and bits of soft meat.  Canned  Campbell's Soup ad from 1923 for the product. A canned condensed oxtail soup was formerly available from the Campbell Soup Company. Oxtail is a popular variety of Heinz soups in the United Kingdom. Despite its popularity in the United Kingdom, some suggest stormy weather and mild flatulence may be experienced after serving oxtail soup aboard a Royal Navy submarine.

This is the shortest in the Kannada language. It narrates two stories of the previous births of the tirthankara. Story plot The first part opens with a prince named Vimalavahana who is overcome by an intense feeling of renunciation upon beholding a few strands of gray hairs on his cheek. The grey hair remind him of the transitoriness of life and the supreme power and inevitability of death. He takes to a life of meditation and is born as a Dev in one of the heavens. In his subsequent birth he becomes Ajithanatha, the king of Ayodhya. The customary fivefold auspicious in the life of a Thirthankara have been described at great length by Ranna with his usual gusts and devotion and piety. He was subject to intense emotional disturbances and did not know how to control them except by giving them to eloquent expression in words. The second part deals with the story of Sagara, the second Chakravarti of Jainism who is deeply attached to all worldly pleasures. His friend Maniketu tries his best to turn the attention of the king towards renunciation but could not succeed. Finally he contrived a plan by which the 60,000 sons of Sagara were killed and in the guise of an old man with a dead son in his arms presented himself before the king and begged of him to enliven the child by fighting with death. Sagara felt helpless in the matter and said that death was no respecter of persons and all must suffer sorrow and pain. There upon Maniketu revealed to him the simultaneous death of his sons. Sagara was overcome with grief but bore it heroically and taking to a life of penance realized him in the end. Ranna has depicted this story in all its pathos and the character of Maniketu in the role of hold man bereaved of his son is the center of interest. The above are the finest parts of his work and when compared with the corresponding parts of the Sanskrit original the improvements made by Ranna can be appreciated. The feature of Ajitha - Purana is the portrait of Attimabbe painted with grateful devotion by Ranna. She was a pious and dutiful Jaina lady famous for her generosity in extending patronage to poets, in erecting temples to the Jina, and in the propagation of Jaina texts. An inscription at Lakkigundi in Dharwar district, probably written by Ranna gives a few more details concerning her religious life. It was for her sake that Ranna wrote the Ajitapurana. Her personality was so pure and noble that the poet has compared her to the sacred waters of the Ganges and to a leap of Snow-White cotton. References  Citation   Source  * Rice, Edward Peter. 1982.

Built for entertaining rather than for defense, it has a ballroom, drawing room, library, morning room, dining room and hall which feature hand- painted ceilings, decorated ornamental corbels, superbly executed stained glass windows and stencil work. The castle stands on massive terraces and has a commanding view over much of its former estate. The castle has Ireland's largest wine cellar, said to hold approximately 55,000 bottles. From May to September 2014, Castle Oliver was opened to the public in conjunction with \\"Limerick City of Culture\\" for house tours.  History  The lands where the castle stands were settled in about 1658 by Capt. Robert Oliver, one of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers. The present castle replaced the former Castle Oliver, which stood a thousand yards to the south-west and was the birthplace of Eliza Oliver, mother of the notorious Lola Montez, who became the lover and favourite of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Castle Oliver east facade with ballroom and dining room in main block, servants' wing and coach house on right Castle Oliver west, stables wing on left The castle was for many years known as Clonodfoy, a contraction of an earlier Irish place name: Cloch an Otbhaidhigh, meaning 'the stone structure of Otway', Otway being an Anglo-Norman family name. Capt. Robert Oliver's descendant Richard Oliver married a Yorkshire heiress through whom he inherited substantial wealth and property in West Yorkshire and moved away to live in Parlington Hall near Leeds, leaving Castle Oliver to deteriorate in the hands of a bailiff. Their daughters, Mary Isabella and Elizabeth Oliver Gascoigne, both married members of the Trench family of Woodlawn, Galway. The younger sister, Elizabeth, married Frederic Mason Trench, 2nd Baron Ashtown in 1852. The sisters were highly accomplished artisans, designing and executing both the stained glass work and verre eglomise (back painted glass panels) which ornamented the ballroom fireplace. Much of their work has survived. The elder sister, Mary Isabella, was a highly skilled wood-turner who published (under a male pseudonym) an authoritative book on the subject, \\"The Art of Wood-Turning\\", still a respected source of information on the subject. Ballroom with verre eglomise fireplace, Gothic- arched doors connect to drawing room The sisters commissioned the present castle in 1845. It was designed by the York architect George Fowler Jones in the Scottish Baronial style and built in a local pink sandstone, quarried on the estate. Fowler Jones had designed several substantial commissions for the sisters in the north of England, including almshouses and churches. Whilst Mary Isabella and her husband made their home in the Yorkshire seat of the Gascoignes (Parlington Hall), Elizabeth and her husband occupied Castle Oliver. The house was later inherited by Elizabeth's step-grandson, the Honourable William Cosby Trench. The last member of the Trench family to live at Castle Oliver, Mrs Lynn Trench, sold the property to the racing driver Billy Coleman in 1978. After that the castle changed hands several times, eventually becoming the property of a local bank, who broke up the remaining land, farm and lodges into separate lots. The castle itself failed to find a buyer and languished into decay, falling prey to vandals and thieves. It appeared in the book \\"Vanishing Houses of Ireland\\", published by the Irish Georgian Society. In 1988 it was purchased by Damian Haughton, who according to the subsequent owner, put a halt to most of the worst leaks in the roof. In 1998 it was purchased by Nicholas Browne, who continued the restoration work and transformed it back into a habitable residence. In 2006 Castle Oliver was purchased by Declan and Emma Cormack from County Antrim. They completed high- grade restoration work, restoring many of the original rooms and features, such as the Library, St Patrick's stained glass window, wooden panelling, cornices and many fireplaces. They made the castle their home with their three children Michael, Shane and Ciara. In 2015 the Cormacks sold it to an unnamed family from Melbourne, Australia to use as a home for \\"several months of the year\\".

It is located south of Orpington, west of Chelsfield, north-west of Pratt's Bottom, north of Hazlewood, and south east of Farnborough. Etymology The name originates from La Grenestrete c.1290, meaning the green or grassy hamlet. It is recorded as Greenstreet Green in 1819, the addition of the suffix Green, referring to a village green.Mills, A., Dictionary of London Place Names, (2001) The village did not historically form a parish of its own, instead forming part of the parishes of Farnborough and Chelsfield.Bartholomew, J., Gazetteer of the British Isles, (1887) History Historical information plaque by the village sign Green Street Green was historically a hamlet, forming part of the coaching routes from London to Sussex. Development only really started with the opening of Oak Brewery by Fox & Sons in 1836, the growth of which led to a modest expansion of the area. Village life centred round the brewery until 1909 when it closed down, causing much unemployment. The area managed to recover, with a row of shops being built along the High Street in 1912. From the 1920s till the 1960s Green Street Green was such a popular meeting point for cyclists that several tea rooms opened in the village, attracting trade from the hordes of weekend cyclists who rode into the Kent countryside from London's suburbs. The former Mrs Valentine Moon's teashop is still a landmark on the east side of Sevenoaks Road, standing opposite The Green. The first modern housing development was at Chelsfield Park in the 1920s. There were plans to extensively remodel the area as a 'model village' in the 1940s, however due to post-war financial constraints this never happened. In 1947, the Town & Country Planning Act set the London Green Belt boundary at the edge of Green Street Green by the A20 and A21 roads. Intensive building, council and private, took place in the 1950s between the village High Street and new Chelsfield. It was during this period that the attractive old people's dwellings were built at Brittenden Close, round three sides of a square lawn with rose gardens and terrace.London Borough of Bromley Official Guide. Published by authority of the Council of the London Borough of Bromley (1971/74) The old brewery became the Telcon Plastics factory site before the Second World War, and has now made way for a new housing estate in 1992.

He is considered the father of Orthopedics in Germany.  From cutler to orthopedic mechanic  Heine was born in Lauterbach on April 3, 1771, the son of a brewer. He was apprenticed to a cutler at √úberlingen and worked as a journeyman cutler in Esslingen am Neckar, Mannheim and Stra√üburg. At length he left Southern Germany and took his residence in Berlin from 1794 to 1798, where he got into contact with Barthel von Siebold, a son of a W√ºrzburg surgeon Karl Kaspar von Siebold. In May 1798 Heine moved to W√ºrzburg and became a craftsman making medical instruments for the W√ºrzburg University. He married Anna F√∂rtsch from W√ºrzburg and had two children, Anna (born 1801), who later married her cousin Bernhard Heine, and Joseph Heine (born 1803), who was to become an important physician in the Electorate of the Palatinate.  Heine's workshop ‚Äì Heine's orthopedic institute  Soon Heine had his own workshop where he manufactured artificial limbs, stretching beds, wheelchairs and other orthopedic appliances and offered them for sale. In 1807 Heine published his Systematic Index of surgery instruments, bandages and machines, a kind of catalogue for physicians,Johann Georg Heine:Systematisches Verzeichnis chirurgischer Instrumente, Bandagen und Maschinen, W√ºrzburg 1807 with later editions in 1811 and 1827. His subsequent publications soon met with recognition among medical experts. He declined an offer to work in Berlin and stayed in W√ºrzburg. The Bavarian crown prince awarded him an order for his merits (\\"Goldene Zivil-Dienst-Medaille\\") and even Johann Wolfgang von Goethe knew Heine's publications and included them in his library. He got to know \\"Operateur Heine\\" at the dinner table of Grand Duke Karl August and invited him to his private home.Goethe's diary entry on April 16 and April 20, 1824 In 1816 Johann Georg Heine opened the first orthopedic institution on German soil. A former monastery (Stephanskloster) in W√ºrzburg housed it and later it became well-known all over Europe as the Karolinen-Institut named after Queen Caroline of Bavaria. By that time the successful mechanic had become a physician although he had no classical medical knowledge. When he started to cure non-orthopedic diseases he provoked conflicts with the rest of the W√ºrzburg doctors, which put an end to a long period of successful co- operation.  The dark years  Memorial plaque for Heine and his nephew at his birthplace, Lauterbach (Black Forest) In 1829 Heine handed the institution over to his nephew Bernhard Heine and moved to the Netherlands. He bought buildings in Brussels and The Hague in order to establish medical institutions. Halfway between The Hague and Scheveningen he established a seaside hospital. Heine had recognized the healing effects medical baths ‚Äì he tried to match orthopedics and balneotherapy. When he tried to cure cholera with baths of ground mustard seed he once again got into conflict with the orthodox school of medicine. Dutch doctors stopped sending him their patients. News from Bavaria let him know that he was banned from practising orthopedics there. He fell ill with hydrothorax and died on September 7, 1838 in Scheveningen.

Studies on Chopin's √âtudes is a set of 53 arrangements of Chopin's √©tudes by Leopold Godowsky. (The number of studies is often given as 54, with Op. 25, No. 2 having one study written as a considerably different ossia of another; a similar ossia also exists for one of the studies on Op. 25, No. 3, so the total number of studies can be taken to be 55. In contrast, Godowsky's original numbering scheme runs only to 48.) They are renowned for their technical difficulty: critic Harold C. Schonberg called them \\"the most impossibly difficult things ever written for the piano.\\" Several of the studies (for example, the study \\"Ignis Fatuus\\" on Chopin's √âtude in A minor, Op. 10, No. 2) put the original right-hand part into the left hand; several others are for the left hand alone (for example, the study on the \\"Revolutionary\\" √âtude, transposed to C minor). Two of the studies even combine two √©tudes; the most well known of these, called \\"Badinage,\\" combines both the G (the \\"Black Key\\" √âtude of Op. 10 and the \\"Butterfly\\" √©tude of Op. 25).

Francesco Libetta (1994, 1995), Carlo Grante (1995) and Emanuele Delucchi (2018) have performed the complete set in concert, but only Libetta has done so from memory. Francesco Libetta performed them again in Miami on July 7, 2018, in two recitals in the same day, one in the afternoon and one in the evening, also all of them by memory. Ivan Iliƒá has made a speciality of the 22 √©tudes for the left hand alone. Only a few other pianists have ventured to record selected studies. The first was Vladimir de Pachmann, who recorded the Study on Op. 10, No. 12 in 1912. Others include Boris Berezovsky, Jorge Bolet, Ian Hobson, Ivan Iliƒá, David Saperton, Victor Schi√∏ler, Jacob Jettomersky, and David Stanhope.

It was originally bound in with copies of Eightball #18 and was also offered for sale individually. Although the back cover describes it as being published by \\"The Catholic Federation for Preservation and Advancement of All Things Related to the Comic Book and its Creators, Inc.,\\" the address given for ordering additional copies is that of Fantagraphics Books, presumably its actual publisher. Because of its subject matter, its small dimensions and its illustrations, and its original distribution inside of a comic book, Modern Cartoonist is sometimes classed as a minicomic. The essay is a series of portentous reflections on the comics medium and its present and future challenges. It is divided into four parts: \\"The Current Situation\\", \\"So, Why Comics?\\", \\"To the Young Cartoonist\\" and \\"The Future and Beyond\\". In a 2001 interview Clowes, while denying that the essay was a joke, said that his intention in Modern Cartoonist was \\"to write something that had this certain tone that I find amusing, something that's on the razor's edge between this sort of pompous, heartfelt earnestness and its ironic counterpoint.\\"The Comics Journal #233, p. 56. Interview by Matt Silvie. Quotes \\"[O]ne of the reasons why comics are such a potentially alluring forum for the individual creator [is that] they are in a sense the ultimate domain of the artist who seeks to wield absolute control over his imagery. Novels are the work of one individual but they require visual collaboration on the part of the reader. Film is by its nature a collaborative endeavor. The filmmaker's vision, filtered through 'reality', is more accessible to a general audience but in most cases less a precise, preconceived vision than one based on compromise and serendipity. Comics offer the creator a chance to control the specifics of his own world in both abstract and literal terms.\\" (p. 7) \\"The new technology promises a structural shift ('democratization' is a word they use) in the reader's favor, giving him an exaggerated role in the give-and-take between artist and audience. He is to be given choices so he can 'interact' with the narrative. Is this a good thing? Is our every reader a worthy collaborator or does his involvement dilute the whole process? Do we, as readers, want this? This is where the 'entertainment media' at large is headed: to pander to the impatient lout and to provide him with material that ranges only from masturbation fodder to the narrative equivalent of a roller-coaster ride.\\" (pp. 13-14) Illustrations Most of the pamphlet's illustrations feature an archetypal cartoonist working at his drawing board. Several are exaggeratedly pessimistic in tone; the cover image shows him surrounded by collapsing buildings, while another shows him slitting his wrists. It is unclear if the drawings are in any sequence that would qualify them as sequential art.

One most notable instance was during the 1981 ABA Summernationals in Amarillo, Texas in which Post thought Kevin McNeal had collided deliberately with him in the first turn. They both went down. Post got up and attempted to hit McNeal, connected, knocking McNeal's visor off. ABA track officials stepped in to prevent things from escalating. What had really happened was that Greg Hill attempted to pass McNeal in the first turn when there was limited space between McNeal and the inside line. Hill and McNeal collided instead both went down. In the same instant McNeal had collided with Post, who was on the outside of McNeal, sending him down. From there the misunderstanding ensued. Adding to the incident. The two, McNeal and Post, had reported personality conflicts when they were teammates on Kuwahara. Post received a 30-day suspension for his actions.BMX Plus! Vol.4 No.10 p.90 Ironically, and perhaps contributing to Post's erroneous belief that McNeal rammed him deliberately, in the previous year it was Kevin McNeal who had the bad reputation as an overly aggressive racer, receiving two suspensions from racing from the NBA and the ABA. McNeal soon after cleaned up his act. :For incidents like this he was called the \\"Excitable boy of BMX\\" and even \\"slightly eccentric\\"BMX Plus!

It was primarily used for training, and was superseded by the Kokusai Ku-7, which was effectively a scaled-up version of the design. Approximately 100 were produced. Design and development Professor Hirosho Sato of the Imperial university engineering college at Kyushu designed an assault glider for the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in response to news of airborne assaults in Europe. The prototype was manufactured by Maeda Aircraft Corporation and designated Ku-1 (Ku - from Kakku - to glide). Once accepted for production the glider was given the long designation Maeda Army Type 2 Small Glider. The Ku-1 was built almost entirely from wood / plywood and was a high-wing glider with twin boom tail sporting a fin and rudder at the end of each boom, with a tail-plane and elevator between the boom ends. The fuselage pod was given a streamlined shape, but with flat sides and a cockpit for two forward of the wing. The undercarriage consisted of two spatted main-wheels on short axles either side of the fuselage, with skids at nose and tail ends of the fuselage pod. The booms, attached to the wing centre-section, were wire-braced horizontally and the fins were braced by short struts on the inboard faces. Passengers and cargo were housed in the cabin below the wing, aft of the cockpit. The three piece wing consisted of the centre-section, attached to the fuselage pod and two outer panels which were tapered and carried the ailerons for roll control.

There were rumors that BMW Oracle was planning on rotating the crew off the boat because they were running out of stories to tell as they sat in the boat waiting for wind. To entertain fans, some teams came up with interesting stunts. For instance, United Internet Germany came up with a way to wakeboard, by having their largest sail trimmers pull on the wakeboarder using the jib trimming system. +39, an Italian challenger, used the windless days off to continue making repairs to their mast, which shattered in a starboard-port situation with Internet Team Germany two weeks earlier, and completed mast repairs by the time racing had commenced. The highlights for the week were not on the water, but rather off it. The Measurement Committee released the final rule interpretations. The rules state that any cup team can request an interpretation and remain anonymous. Additionally, any interpretation by the committee stays private for 6 months. Every cup team and all the media was trying to find out more about two of the final interpretations. It seems that one boat may have found a significant advantage, but everyone would have to wait until the end of the Cup to find out who and exactly what had happened. Racing was scheduled to start on April 16, 2007, but did not get underway until April 20, 2007. {  - ! Date ! Team 1 15px ! Team 2 15px ! Winner ! Delta !

Although many of the results were easy to predict, a few upsets occurred in the first round robin. In the first race of the first flight, the powerhouse from New Zealand lost to the Mascalzone Latino, an Italian challenger. In the fourth flight, Shosholoza, the underdog from South Africa, beat Luna Rossa from Italy, a three time cup veteran. Due to the lack of wind the first week, the second round robin began without any lay days after the first. The first surprise of the second round robin was by China Team, who beat the favored BMW Oracle Racing team by 3 minutes and 15 seconds, the only team yet to achieve a win against BMW Oracle. The win was due to a delamination on the American team's headsail foil which caused the headsail to become partially detached making the sail totally ineffective for part of the race. Also, the Americans gave their best crew members a holiday and sailed against the Chinese with a less experienced crew. The following day several of the China Team members arrived at the compound with bald heads. Reportedly they bet one another that if they beat the Americans, they would shave their heads. The final round of round robin competition featured a race for the top place. Both Emirates Team New Zealand and the United States had lost one race in the first round and zero in the second round robin. Because of Bonus Points from previous acts, New Zealand had a one-point advantage over the United States. Each race counted as two points, so a win for either team would result in the first- place finish in the round robins. The final race was expected to be an exciting match between the two. However, after the start, the race quickly became disappointing for BMW Oracle fans, with New Zealand stretching their early lead. The result was New Zealand winning the round robin, and was able to choose its opponent for the subsequent semi-final round. {  - ! Date ! Team 1 15px ! Team 2 15px ! Winner ! Delta !

Hence BMW Oracle Racing raced against Luna Rossa Challenge in the other semi-final. The first team in each semi-final to win 5 races then qualified for the finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup. Each pairing had raced against each other twice in the preceding round- robin events. In their previous meetings, Emirates Team New Zealand had a 2‚Äì0 record against Desaf√≠o Espa√±ol 2007 with winning margins of 1:12 and 0:43. In their semi-final competition Emirates Team New Zealand always led at the 1st mark and beat Desaf√≠o Espa√±ol 2007 5‚Äì2, advancing to the finals. Likewise, BMW Oracle Racing had a 2‚Äì0 record against Luna Rossa Challenge with winning margins of 0:06 and 0:19 but were comprehensively beaten 1‚Äì5 by Luna Rosa Challenge in their semi-final. Superior tactics by Luna Rossa Challenge in the pre-start sequences were a significant factor in their semi-final win. Luna Rossa Challenge advanced to face Emirates Team New Zealand in the finals. {  - ! Date ! Team 1 15px ! Team 2 15px ! Winner ! Delta ! Score ! Timings !

Both boats had decisive results in the semi-finals, where Luna Rossa Challenge defeated BMW Oracle Racing 5‚Äì1, and Emirates Team New Zealand defeated Desaf√≠o Espa√±ol 2007 5‚Äì2. The two teams raced against each other in each of the two round robins. Luna Rossa Challenge won their race in round robin 1 on 26 April 2007 by 48 seconds. Emirates Team New Zealand won their race in round robin 2 on 7 May 2007 by 36 seconds. Prior to the final, expert commentators were fairly unanimous that Emirates Team New Zealand were in top form but Luna Rossa Challenge had improved since the round robins as evidenced by their comprehensive beating of BMW Oracle Racing, one of the favourites, in their semi-final. In the best of 9 race final Emirates Team New Zealand beat Luna Rossa Challenge 5‚Äì0. However to put this into context, Luna Rossa Challenge 'worst' defeat was in race 3 when Emirates Team New Zealand were only 0:1:38 seconds faster in a race lasting 1:35:37 i.e. a 1.71% performance advantage. In the other 4 races the performance margin was even smaller. Luna Rossa Challenge won the toss prior to the first race of the final which gave them the advantage of entering the starting area from the \\"yellow\\" side. In the results tables below, the team with the advantage of entering the starting area from the yellow side (entering from the right-hand side on starboard tack) is marked with 15px. This is decided for the first race by the toss of a coin; then the advantage of starting from the yellow side alternates race by race. {  - ! Date ! Team 1 15px ! Team 2 15px ! Winner ! Delta !

After remeasurement, both LRC boats did some quick testing. Race 5 began with LRC at full speed and a 1-second lead over ETNZ. However, by the first mark, ETNZ led by 20 seconds. The remainder of the race entailed LRC catching ETNZ but then dropping back. At one point in the last downwind leg LRC were within one boat length but dropped back before the finish. } References External links *32nd America's Cup Official Website *Peter Lester NZ yachting commentator *AC 32 Challenger Commission Official website of the Challenger Commission for the 32nd America's Cup in Valencia *Team Alinghi Official website the America's Cup Defender *BMW Oracle Racing Official website of Challenger of Record of the America's Cup *BMW Oracle Racing Blog Tom Ehman's Insider Blog *CupInfo.com America's Cup News and Information for 2007 *America's Cup News, articles & photos *Valencia Sailing Website with original photos and commentary on all America's Cup related activity *Cup In Europe web site Exhaustive information, photos and commentary in French. *Coupe de l'America French website about the competition. *Mariantic America's Cup News & Views *2007AC.com - America's Cup Forums *South African team website *The effect of the America's cup on the city of Valencia article at ErasmusPC *Hundreds of Louis Vuitton Cup photos *Lyn Hines Marine Marketing America's Cup and sailing news analysis and photos Category:Louis Vuitton regattas L Category:Sports competitions in Valencia Category:2007 in Spanish sport Category:21st century in Valencia Category:April 2007 sports events in Europe Category:May 2007 sports events in Europe Category:June 2007 sports events in Europe Category:2007 America's Cup Category:International America's Cup Class Category:Sailing competitions in Spain ","title":"2007 Louis Vuitton Cup"},{"id":"10961102","text":"Ovicide may refer to: * Insecticides that are designed to kill eggs * Infanticide (zoology), the destruction of eggs ","title":"Ovicide"},{"id":"10961109","text":"thumb Henk Marcel Dost (born September 28, 1969 in Zierikzee) is a retired decathlete from the Netherlands, who represented his native country at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.

It has leaves to 80 cm, and a flower stem to 1.5 m.Wild food plants of Australia, Tim Low Blue flowers in spring and summer are followed by violet berries. It adapts readily to cultivation and is commonly seen in Australian gardens. Unlike other Dianella species, its fruit is toxic.https://www.ozbreed.com.au/plant-ranges/dianellas/ Taxonomy Dianella tasmanica was first described in 1858 by eminent English botanist and explorer Joseph Dalton Hooker.Hooker, J.D. (1858), The botany of the Antarctic voyage of H.M. discovery ships Erebus and Terror. III. Flora Tasmaniae 2(6): 57, t. CXXXIII. The genus name is derived from the Roman goddess Diana, with a diminutive suffix -ella. Description Dianella tasmanica is a strappy herbaceous plant which grows to 0.5‚Äì2 metres (1‚Äì7 ft) high and wide, with a thick spreading rhizome under the ground. The green linear keeled leaves have finely toothed margins, and may reach 1 m (40 in) in length and 1.5‚Äì4 cm wide.

Created by Otto Binder and C.C. Beck, he now appears as a foe of Captain Marvel. Publication history Created by writer Otto Binder and artist C. C. Beck, King Kull's first appearance was in Captain Marvel Adventures #125 (cover- dated Oct. 1951). King Kull appeared in adventures of Captain Marvel during the 1950s and the period in which DC Comics revived the hero during the 1970s. Fictional character biography In prehistoric times (according to one account around 28,000 BC), King Kull is ruler of the Submen (also called Beast-Men), a brutish but technologically advanced race that ruled humanity until they were overthrown in a revolt thousands of years ago, as the humans vastly outnumbered them and killed all the other Beast-Men. Kull fakes his death with a bomb and survives until the 20th century in suspended animation in a cavern, then awakens due to an earthquake and repeatedly threatens the human-dominated modern world with his immense strength, durability, and bizarre technology, which is in Captain Marvel's region. However, other versions claim he emerged throughout human history and attempted to stop the spread of democracy, and is apparently the basis for the Bogeyman and other mythical monsters.Captain Marvel Adventures #149. Fawcett Comics. He is usually thwarted by Captain Marvel or the Marvel Family.Captain Marvel Adventures #125. Fawcett Comics. On one occasion, he collaborated with Doctor Sivana.Captain Marvel Adventures #130. Fawcett Comics. On another occasion, he released the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man and using Sin bombs to try destroying the world.Captain Marvel Adventures #137. DC Comics. King Kull once tried to turn Billy to stone instead on one occasion. One particularly well-planned escapade requires the efforts of the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America (in one of their dimension-crossing team-ups, which DC produced annually from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s), as well as a group of heroes of Captain Marvel and King Kull's home universe of Earth-S, referred to unofficially as Shazam's Squadron of Justice. All of these are required because Kull has captured both the wizard Shazam who grants the Marvel Family's powers and the ancient gods and goddesses the powers are drawn from after gaining access to the Rock of Eternity with a faster-than-light ship, paralyzing them with a device that slowed down their impulses, except for the swift Mercury who was able to get away in time; after Shazam makes telepathic communication with him he warns other heroes from the Three Earths about King Kull. Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt helps the Marvels get their powers back in the final issue and transports them to the Rock of Eternity. Kull recruits the aid of villains from the three earths: Penguin of Earth-One, Queen Clea of Earth-Two, Blockbuster of Earth-One, and Ibac of Earth-S for his Earth-Two attack, where he tries to wreck Atlantis and use a cloud to sink islands.Justice League of America #135. DC Comics. For Earth-S, he recruits Joker of Earth-Two, Weeper II of Earth-S, Doctor Light of Earth-One, and Shade of Earth-One, who trap one side of the world in light and another in darkness, and try to transform people into different materials.Justice League of America #136. DC Comics. For Earth-1, he recruits Mister Atom of Earth-S and Brainiac, who attack the city of Tomorrow, and increase the Earth's rotation to send people into the air. He is trying to wipe out humanity on all three Earths so his people can rule once again. They are all defeated, and the heroes then head to the Rock of Eternity, with Superman leading the attack. Despite turning Superman against the other super heroes using a Red Kryptonite chunk which fills Superman's mind with rage and makes him invulnerable to green kryptonite he is eventually defeated after Captain Marvel knocks him out, Jr. destroys the Red Kryptonite, Mary frees the Elders, and Cap uses his lightning to restore Superman's mind. King Kull was imprisoned with magic chains that supposedly even Hercules could not break, and the heroes returned to their own worlds.Justice League of America #137. DC Comics. King Kull has occasionally appeared as a member of the final Monster Society of Evil, and assisted in their assault on the Rock of Eternity with an army from 247 planets. The character has not appeared since Captain Marvel's history was rebooted by Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985. He is sometimes confused with Kull, a barbarian hero and king created by Robert E. Howard, but Howard's Kull was an ancient human in a sword-and-sorcery setting rather than a protohuman with science-fiction technology. King Kull made his first appearance in over 20 years in the fifth issue of the limited series Justice League: Cry For Justice. Here, he was shown battling Stargirl and Cyclone as part of a massive plot by Prometheus to distract Earth's superheroes so that he could plant massive teleportation devices in various cities.Justice League: Cry for Justice #5. DC Comics. In \\"DC Rebirth,\\" King Kull came from the Earthlands and is a member of the Monster Society of Evil. He was among its members imprisoned in the Dungeon of Eternity within the Monsterlands until Mister Mind instructed Doctor Sivana on how to free them.Shazam! Vol. 3 #11. DC Comics. As Shazam fights the Mister Mind-controlled C.C. Batson, King Kull states to the rest of the Monster Society of Evil to leave the women to him while Mister Merry-Go-Round states that he \\"gets the youngest to play with\\" which is what they agreed on. While mentioning that his kind used to rule the Earthlands, Mary tricks King Kull into attacking the three-headed Crocodile- Man. He manages to pin Mary down as Mister Mind provokes Shazam into reading a spell from the Book of Champions that unites the Seven Magiclands.Shazam! Vol. 3 #13. DC Comics. King Kull continues his fight with Mary until magical energy emitted from Shazam defeating Mister Mind knocked him and the Monster Society of Evil out. The Monster Society of Evil was mentioned to have been remanded to Rock Falls Penitentiary where the Shazam Family built a special section to contain magical threats.Shazam! Vol. 3 #14. DC Comics. Powers and abilities King Kull has super-strength, enhanced durability, and enhanced stamina. He also possesses genius-level intellect and is an expert at hand-to- hand combat. Related characters Prior to King Kull, there have been some characters that had his traits: A similar-looking villain called the Beast- Ruler appears. He was created by the mad scientist Sivana with a humanoid body and animal qualities like a gorilla's strength, a serpent's speed, a tiger's fighting skills, a fox's cunning, a lion's bravery, and an elephant's memory after imbuing it with the lifeforce that was drawn from 1,000 animals. He turns against Sivana and tries to attack humanity with an animal army, hating man despite his similar appearance and planning to make animals rule. Captain Marvel leads an army of animals against his. He is finally thrown over a waterfall in a fight with Captain Marvel.Captain Marvel Adventures #3. Fawcett Comics. A race of prehistoric men who have been frozen for thousands of years at the North Pole make their only appearance. They are apparently strong enough to survive a bazooka shell, super-intelligent, and explorer Rodney Stark has devised a method of bringing them back to life, planning to use them to build an air force, using copies of stolen U.S planes, allowing him to take over the world. They are all destroyed in an explosion along with Stark when Captain Marvel makes their planes crash.Whiz Comics #7. Fawcett Comics. In other media In the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Menace from the Conquering Caveman!\\", there is a villain called Kru'll the Eternal (voiced by Michael Dorn) who is visually based on Kull and is also inspired by Vandal Savage due to sporting immortality.

The commercially successful .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the .300 Lapua Magnum, which is essentially a necked-down version of the .338 Lapua Magnum. The .338 cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with smaller and hence lighter bullets result in very high muzzle velocities. History The Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua got the .300 Lapua Magnum C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes √† Feu Portatives) certified, so it became an officially registered and sanctioned member of the Finnish 70 mm \\"family\\" of super magnum rifle cartridges. The .300 Lapua Magnum is not commercially available anymore today and currently (2007) exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It is however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from .338 Lapua Magnum brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with .30 caliber bullets. Cartridge dimensions The .300 Lapua Magnum has 7.34 ml (113 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the Lapua Magnum case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt action rifles, semi-automatic and automatic firearms alike, under extreme conditions. 400px .300 Lapua Magnum maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm). Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ‚âà 25 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in), 4 grooves, √ò lands = 7.62 mm, √ò grooves = 7.82 mm, land width = 4.47 mm and the primer type is large rifle magnum. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes √† Feu Portatives) rulings the .300 Lapua Magnum can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. This now prevails over the C.I.P. decisions and tables edition 2007, that rated the .300 Lapua Magnum at Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.C.I.P. TDCC sheet 300 Lapua Mag. This means that .300 Lapua Magnum chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are currently (2013) proof tested at PE piezo pressure. The .300 Lapua Magnum has a very high maximum allowed chamber pressure level and indicates that the cases of the .300 and .338 Lapua Magnum are built extremely sturdy. The large boltface combined with the high 440 MPa maximum pressure makes that the .300 Lapua Magnum should only be chambered in rifles that are capable of handling such large and fierce cartridges and thus high bolt thrust safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using Pmax loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders. A bolt-action rifle that theoretically could safely be chambered for the 94.5 mm long .300 Lapua Magnum is the Sako TRG-42. This rifle was specially designed for .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges and can handle cartridges up to 95 mm overall length. Additional information The .300 Lapua Magnum‚Äôs main appeal is long-range shooting. Due to the large case capacity in relation to the 7.62 mm (.308 inch) caliber bore size the .300 Lapua Magnum is very harsh on barrels. The overbore .300 Lapua Magnum typically wears out a rifle barrel in 1000 to 1500 rounds. A lot of thorough barrel cleaning (after every 5 to 10 shots) and carefully avoiding long strings of shots can help to minimize barrel wear. This makes this cartridge impractical for most competition and professional long-range shooters, like military snipers, who tend to fire many rounds in practice to acquire and maintain expert long-range marksmanship. The Lapua/VihtaVuori international reloading guide 2008 reveals that at 690 mm (27.165 in) barrel length the .300 Lapua Magnum loaded with heavy .30 caliber bullets yields less muzzle energy compared to its .338 Lapua Magnum parent cartridge. The American .30-378 Weatherby Magnum cartridge introduced in 1996 and the American .300 Remington Ultra Magnum (.300 RUM) cartridge introduced in 1999 are probably the closest currently (2007) commercially available ballistic twins of the .300 Lapua Magnum. The .30-378 Weatherby Magnum is however a belted cartridge and the .300 Remington Ultra Magnum is a rebated rim cartridge.

He is a tutor at City and Guilds of London Art School Free Art Fair In 2007 he created the Free Art Fair in central London. It was an art exhibition where all the art works that were in the exhibition were given away at the end of the exhibition. Other artists who exhibited at the Free Art Fair included Harry Pye, Bruce McLean, and Bob and Roberta Smith. The event was intended to contrast the Free Art Fair with another art fair occurring at the same time (October 2007), the Frieze Art Fair. By all accounts, the timing and execution of the Free Art Fair was indeed effective. The giveaway of the works of art received live coverage on BBC News 24, and a queue formed overnight. The Free Art Fair returned in 2008 with 50 artists participating and a program of performance art organised by Lee Campbell and Frog Morris. A catalogue included an interview with Lewis Hyde author of \\"The Gift\\". Artists included Gavin Turk, Marta Marce, Martin Sexton, Stephen Farthing, and Stella Vine. In 2009 the final fair took place at The Barbican Centre in London. Artists including Marlene Dumas, Bob & Roberta Smith, Robin Mason, Harry Pye, Artists Anonymous and Geraldine Swayne gave away work. Collaborations with Harry Pye Joffe has collaborated with artist Harry Pye on projects such as The Tate Modern in a dry cleaner in 2010 which included a talk by Turner Prize winner Mark Leckey They made their own handmade 99p shop in 2011, and produced ‚ÄòJoffe et Pye‚Äô at Chateau Joffe in 2011.

Warrington Corporation Bill, 1923 In 1923 a proposal was put before the British Parliament to flood of the area, to form a reservoir to provide water to the Corporation of Warrington, evicting the local farming and working population and completely obliterating the village of Tregeiriog. The water would, in part, have been used for Warrington's brewing industry. Opposers of the proposal, who were backed by a fund organised by the Western Mail newspaper, used the slogan \\"They want to take the \\"W\\" out of WALES and turn it into ALES\\". The proposal was opposed by many Welsh MPs, including David Lloyd George,Hansard 13 March 1923 vol 161 cc1405-47 and was ultimately defeated.

It is immediately north of the border with New South Wales and the Dingo fence. At the , Hungerford and the surrounding area within Queensland had a population of 23. The locality of Hungerford on the New South Wales side of the border had a population of 15.  Geography  The locality is split between the Shire of Bulloo (western part) and the Shire of Paroo (eastern part). The town is located in the Shire of Bulloo immediately north of the border between Queensland and New South Wales. Surrounding the town is the Currawinya National Park. Hungerford Aerodrome is operated by the Bulloo Shire Council. It is to the east on the town on the Hungerford Airstrip Road (). There is one sealed runway long. It has no lighting but portable lights and flairs can be used in emergencies. History Hungerford was in Badjiri territory. The town is named after Thomas Hungerford who once camped at the site. The town developed from a border customs post on a stock route alongside the Paroo River. In 1874, the first hotel opened and the following year the town was gazetted. For a number of years, before a proper survey was conducted the town was thought to be located in New South Wales. Hungerford Post Office opened on 1 October 1880, was replaced by a New South Wales office in 1881, reopened in 1886 and closed by 1907, replaced the New South Wales office in 1941 and closed by 1985. In 1892-3, Henry Lawson visited the town and wrote a short story named after it. In the story he wrote: > The town is right on the Queensland border, and an inter-provincial rabbit- > proof fence -- with rabbits on both sides of it -- runs across the main > street. ... > Hungerford consists of two houses and a humpy in New South Wales, and five > houses in Queensland. Characteristically enough, both the pubs are in > Queensland. We got a glass of sour yeast at one and paid six pence for it -- > we had asked for English ale. A Cobb & Co coach service to the town was stopped in 1904. Hungerford Provisional School opened in 1892, becoming Hungerford State School in 1909. It closed in 1918, due to low attendance. It reopened in 1928, but low attendances caused it to close again in 1930. It was reopened a final time, this time located in the Bulloo Shire Hall, between 30 January and 11 December 1981. Hungerford will be the site of a total solar eclipse on 22 July 2028.

In addition to the general Nickelodeon programmes, local productions such as ZOOP, Het Huis Anubis, Het Huis Anubis en de Vijf van het Magische Zwaard and SuperNick are also broadcast. The Dutch Kids' Choice Awards were presented in 2004, 2005 and 2007, featuring nominees that are relevant to Dutch audiences. In 2010 the American Kids' Choice Awards aired, which included categories for the Netherlands and Flanders inserted into the broadcast. Nickelodeon has a separate version in Flanders with advertising and programming variations for Belgian viewers. All Belgian cable and ISP providers carry the Flemish version, with the satellite provider TV Vlaanderen offering only the Dutch version, as it uses the feed of the Dutch CanalDigitaal.  History (Netherlands)  Nickelodeon replaced a similarly-themed channel, Kindernet, in 2003 after it was acquired by Viacom at the end of 2001. Before this, Nickelodeon aired as a programming block on Kindernet from 1:00 to 3:00 PM, beginning in February 2002. Throughout the course of 2003, Nickelodeon programming began to gain more prominence on Kindernet outside of the block, before expanding into a 24-hour channel on 14 July. As a result, Kindernet was degraded into a morning block, which later became Nick Jr.. On 1 August 2005, Nickelodeon began time-sharing with Talpa, now airing between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM. By the end of 2006, MTV's deal with Talpa ended and Nickelodeon began sharing channel space with The Box Comedy on 1 December. Nickelodeon extended its airtime till 8 PM and The Box Comedy changed into Comedy Central on 30 April 2007. Comedy Central switched to TMF on 1 January 2011, and Nickelodeon resumed its 24-hour broadcast on 14 February. Sometime after, a TeenNick block was added to the channel's schedule during the overnight hours, airing between 9:00 PM and 6:00 Am. All programming on Nickelodeon's regular schedule is available in Dutch, with the exception of Dutch-Flemish productions. A high- definition simulcast of Nickelodeon was slated to launch through UPC Netherlands on 3 April 2012, but ended up being delayed due to technical problems. Nickelodeon HD eventually launched on 13 September 2012, this time through KPN Interactive TV. On 1 October 2015, sister channel Spike was launched and initially aired during Nickelodeon's overnight hours. On 12 December 2016, Spike became its own 24-hour channel on Ziggo, before launching on other providers (such as KPN, Telfort, XS4ALL, Caiway and T-Mobile Thuis) three months later. Nickelodeon continues to air 24/7 in the Netherlands, broadcasting TeenNick programming at night and also introducing a version of The Splat.

Also known as the Douglas-Lillooet Trail or the Lillooet Trail (not to be confused with the Lillooet Cattle Trail, also called the Lillooet Trail), the route consisted of a series of wagon roads connected via lake travel in between. A variety of craft were used on the lakes, from steamboats to sail-driven rafts to, through the early 20th Century, diesel and other engines. Lake travel continued for commerce, passenger travel and heavy freight until after World War II. There were originally four lakes on the route, in addition to Harrison Lake at the road's commencement at Port Douglas, which is navigable from the Lower Fraser and so also from the Gulf of Georgia and Victoria and beyond. These were Little Lillooet Lake (Tenas Lake - \\"tenas\\" means \\"small\\" or \\"child\\" in the Chinook Jargon, a name also used for Birken Lake which also lies along the route), Lillooet Lake, Anderson Lake and Seton Lake, the foot of which is within a few miles of the Fraser River at today's town of Lillooet (until 1860 called Cayoosh Flat or Cayoosh) and from where the last few miles of wagon road completed the official Douglas Road. From there the Old Cariboo Road was constructed by entrepreneur Gustavus Blin Wright to Alexandria in order to serve the booming traffic to the Cariboo and points northwards. The combination of the Douglas Road and Blin-Wright's toll road were the main route north for freight and travel (excepting the River Trail which was for packhorses, mules and foot only) and so the Douglas Road and its various vessels saw a huge amount of traffic, though declining rapidly once the Cariboo Road from Yale via Ashcroft was opened in 1864 (the critical section from Yale to the existing older road at Clinton, which bypassed Port Douglas, Douglas Road and Lillooet entirely, being completed by about 1863) after which the route fell into decline. Continued needs by the communities in the isolated Pemberton and Gates Valleys, which were dependent on Lillooet for most services and on either Lillooet or the old sea-access from Port Douglas meant that for many years passenger and freight services continued on a smaller scale, particularly on Seton and Anderson Lakes. The boom in the Bridge River goldfields from the 1890s and the transportation of heavy equipment into the mines required barge transport, and the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway along the north shores of these lakes also involved their own small flotilla of construction-related craft. Later, when development of the Bridge River Project swung into full gear after World War II, hydro construction also required lake transport, although rail service was largely preferred. Little Lillooet Lake was raised slightly by the Royal Engineers in their improvements to the route, turning it into a lower arm of Lillooet Lake, obliterating the need for the short portage to Lillooet Lake and moving the southern port on that lake - originally called Port Lillooet - down to what had been the south end of Little Lillooet Lake.

Early life Pye was born in London. He completed a foundation course at Camberwell School of Art in 1991. He then studied printmaking at Winchester School of Art from 1992 to 1995. In his second year he stopped painting and printmaking and began making films. His first films were interviews with artist and tutor Bruce McLean, and he has since interviewed many other artists including Humphrey Ocean, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Wolfgang Tillmans, and Keith Tyson for various publications including The Face, Turps Banana, and Untitled. He has also edited and published numerous art based fanzines of his own, such as \\"Harry Pye's FRANK Magazine\\", which ran from 1995 to 2000.  Art career  In May 2000 he was invited to curate an exhibition at Glassbox in Paris, France. The name of this show was \\"It May Be Rubbish, But It's British Rubbish\\". In 2002 he curated a show at The Bart Wells Institute in London Fields, \\"Viva Pablo\\".Reviewed by Fisun Guner for the Metro Newspaper, Thursday, 29 August 2002. A year later he organized a group show with 100 artists called, 100 MOTHERS which took place at The Oh Art Gallery in the Oxford House in Bethnal Green, and then toured to the North Edinburgh Art Centre in Scotland. This exhibit was also included in The Other Art Fair in 2013. In November 2006 he curated a tribute to the DJ John Peel at the NOMOREGREY Gallery in Shoreditch entitled \\"For Peel\\", which consisted of more than 60 artists including Jessica Voorsanger, Sarah Doyle, and Cathy Lomax, all of whom had made work relating to a band or singer that John Peel had discovered or championed. Pye did not contribute any artwork of his own to these exhibitions. According to press release material, he only began making paintings of his own in 2004, inspired by a Royal Academy exhibition of Philip Guston and a show about Mathias Kauage at the Horniman Museum, which both took place in this same year. Pye's first solo show took place at Sartorial Contemporary Art in Notting Hill in February 2007. The name of his show was, \\"Me, Me, Me\\". As well as more than 20 paintings, the show featured a 30-minute video made in collaboration with artist Gordon Beswick and comedy writers and performers Richard Herring and Robin Ince. Pye's second solo show at Sartorial was called \\"Getting Better\\" and took place in March 2009. His third Sartorial show was called \\"Values\\" and took place in September 2010. Pye has made collaborative paintings with various other artists including Gordon Beswick, Rowland Smith, Marcus Cope, Kes Richardson, James Jessop, Billy Childish, Frank Sidebottom, Sarah Sparkes, Liz Murray, Geraldine Swayne, and Mat Humphrey. Almost half of the paintings in the \\"Me, Me, Me\\" show were collaborations with Rowland Smith, who Pye has known since his school days. In March 2007 Jessica Lack of The Guardian described him as \\"the master of lo-fi British art\\". In April 2007 Pye won first prize in a competition to paint a portrait of Tony Blair, organised by the Daily Mirror. The judges were artists Gilbert and George.Daily Mirror, Thursday, 26 April 2007 pages 20 & 21.

The show featured drawings and paintings inspired by poems and visitors to the gallery could only gain entry if they brought with them a poem that had moved or inspired them. Artists taking part in the project included Lloyd Durling, Marenka Gabeler, Marisol Malatesta, Mark McGowan, John Moseley, and Edward Ward. In September 2008 Pye and Rowland Smith exhibited several paintings they had made in collaboration in a show called Fresh Air Machine at a new Shoreditch art space called Calvert 22. The show was supported by the Outset organization and was part of the Concrete and Glass festival.

Pye has recently been collaborating with artist Jasper Joffe on projects and exhibitions such as Jasper & Harry's Tate Modern, Matisse at Christmas, and the 99p Art Shop. On 6 August 2011 critic Ekow Eshun was asked to review the exhibition \\"Joffe et Pye\\" for BBC Radio 4's Saturday Review, and wrote that: \\"Intense feelings about love, loneliness and fear, anxiety, desire and hope, and ambition all come into play into these paintings. Very powerful I thought. What could have been fey, arch, or game playing was actually very warm.\\" In November 2012 six paintings by Harry Pye were featured in the Discerning Eye exhibition at The Mall Gallery in London. Pye's work in this show was praised by Naomi Mdudu of City AM. In January 2013 it was announced on Resonance FM that Pye and Francis Macdonald were working on a music project together and had collaborated on ten new songs. Pye's artwork has been displayed on the London Underground in conjunction with the arts company Art Below. Ben Moore of Art Below featured Pye's works along with Peter Kennard, Nasser Azam, Moore, and six other artists as part of Thatcheristic.‚ÄúThatcheristic: new exhibition showing a different side to the Iron Lady,‚Äù London Evening Standard, 12 April 2013.

Playing career Plummer began his career as a trainee with Bristol City, turning professional in September 1995. He joined Stevenage Borough in November 1998 on a free transfer, after initially being on loan. He then played for Chesham United before joining Bristol Rovers in September 2000. Later that month he scored the winning penalty as Rovers put Premiership Everton out of the League Cup. His time with Rovers was disrupted by injuries, and he left in September 2002 when his contract was terminated for 'gross misconduct' involving an 'incident at a gym'. He had a few months without a club before joining Harlow Town in January 2003.

Since June 4, 2018, the company has been owned by Winnebago Industries, an American manufacturer of recreational vehicles.Galvin, Terry. \\"Chris-Craft bought by Winnebago\\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune (June 4, 2018). Retrieved 2018-06-09. Chris-Craft Corporation is at least the fourth iteration of the boat building company. The original company, Chris-Craft Boats, was founded in the late 19th century by Christopher Columbus Smith (1861‚Äì1939) in Michigan. It became famous for its mahogany-hulled powerboats from the 1920s through the 1950s. It was succeeded by Chris-Craft Industries and then Murray Chris-Craft before becoming Chris-Craft Corporation. Original company Chris Smith built his first wooden boat ‚Äî a simple skiff, or ‚Äúpunt‚Äù ‚Äî in 1874 when he was 13 years old. In 1881, he joined his brother Henry to begin manufacturing boats full-time. In 1910, the brothers joined with other partners to form the Smith Ryan Boat and Engine Company, focusing on building fast, economically- priced runabout boats for mass-market distribution. Their products made their debut at the New York and Chicago Boat Shows that year. In 1922, Smith formed the Chris Smith & Sons Boat Company in Algonac, Michigan. The company name was changed to Chris-Craft in 1924. Chris-Craft sold high-end powerboats to wealthy patrons, such as Henry Ford and William Randolph Hearst. In 1927, Chris Smith's son, Jay Smith, took over the company as President and General Manager ‚Äì positions he would hold for the next 31 years. Chris Smith died in 1939, at the age of 78. With the United States entering the Second World War in 1941, Chris-Craft shifted its focus to producing military goods, including patrol boats, rescue vessels, and utility launches for the United States Army and Navy. By the end of hostilities in 1945, the company had constructed in excess of 12,000 small boats for the United States military. Following the war, Chris-Craft introduced a new lineup of civilian pleasure boats in time for the great American consumer market expansion of the 1950s. The company sold high-end boats to famous customers, such as Dean Martin, Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley. The boats were typically made from mahogany, and they were considered to be among the best available. They were easy to operate and maintain, which was a significant requirement for their \\"weekend sailor\\" owners. That decade marked the height of company prestige, and the brand name Chris-Craft became virtually synonymous with pleasure boating. At one time, the company offered 159 different models, and it was the sales leader in many categories of small civilian powerboats. Chris-Craft constructed its first fiberglass boat in 1955, and by 1957, the company purchased the Roamer Boat Company and began manufacturing metal boats under its newly formed Roamer Steel Boats Division (RSBD). Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. Chris-Craft was acquired by Shields & Company's National Automotive Fibers, Inc. (NAFI) in 1960. In 1962, the new owners renamed the company Chris-Craft Industries, Incorporated. In 1962, the company acquired the Old Crown Brewing Corporation, a brewery company based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Old Crown was sold to its employees a short time later. In 1964, Chris-Craft launched the all-fiberglass Chris-Craft Commander. This dramatic new design was unveiled at the New York City National Boat show, perched at the top of an escalator on a giant, castered cradle. This first Commander was a 38' express hardtop with a 13' beam. The line of Commanders soon grew to include sizes ranging from 19' to 60' ‚Äî all \\"styled in fiberglass.\\" Between the 1960s and 1980s, Chris-Craft increasingly moved toward fiberglass as a construction material of choice, primarily because of its durability and low maintenance requirements. Chris-Craft ended production of its last mahogany-hulled boat, the Constellation, in 1971.  Murray Chris-Craft  In the face of declining sales due to the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Chris-Craft Industries sold its boat division to George Dale Murray and a small group of investors that included Dick Genth, F. Lee Bailey, and Walt Schumacher in 1981. Chris-Craft Industries retained the Chris-Craft trademark and licensed it to Murray.Chris-Craft Industries Chris-Craft Industries was subsequently acquired by News Corporation in 2000 for its television subsidiaries. In fulfilling a commitment to return to powerboat racing, in 1984 Murray Chris- Craft developed the new 300 Chris-Cat, a racing catamaran powered by twin 400 or 420 horsepower high performance power plants and was added to its 1984 sport boat fleet. The boat went on to set new speed records in its class that year and in years to come. Murray believed that a racing program would benefit the company to develop safe, performance watercraft for its customers. In addition to developing the Chris-Cat models for racing, Murray Chris-Craft also raced its deep-v, offshore Stinger models. Most notably, a 1984 Chris- Craft 312 won the Golden Gate to Spruce Goose race sponsored by Powerboat Magazine in 1984. In 1984, Chris-Craft worked out a deal with Michael Mann Productions to have its 39-foot Stinger 390X featured on their new television show, Miami Vice. Five Stinger 390Xs were supplied to the show for filming of the premiere and first-season episodes. The show became a hit, and the placement of the Stingers on the show produced increased sales at Chris-Craft. Chris-Craft's annual sales for 1984 were $120M. While the turnaround at Murray Chris-Craft seemed to be going smoothly, the relationship between partners George Dale Murray and Dick Genth was souring. Murray wanted to move Genth out of running the day-to-day operations of the company, and in August 1984, he offered the position of vice-chairman to Genth. Genth declined the offer, and resigned from Chris-Craft. Ernest J. Schmidt took over as president of Chris- Craft. Chris-Craft's annual sales plateaued in 1986 at around $180M. As the company grew, George Dale Murray became involved in various real-estate ventures, which included a sizeable investment in the American Community Development Group (ACDG). The ACDG investment did not go well for Murray, and as early as 1986, he began looking to sell his shares in Chris-Craft. Murray found a buyer for his shares - Dr. Ghaith Pharaon. Pharaon began buying shares in 1986, and by 1988, he owned approximately 80% of Murray Chris-Craft. In 1988, Pharaon hired independent auditors to go through the financials of the company. The resulting audit detailed serious accounting irregularities. The auditors estimated that the company had $77M in assets and $40M in debt. Pharaon, now majority owner of Murray Chris-Craft, pushed George Dale Murray out of the company and brought a suit against him seeking $34M in damages and $106M in punitive damages. In the meantime, Chris-Craft continued to lose money. It was estimated that Chris-Craft was losing $2M/month in the second half of 1988. The situation for the company had become untenable, and on December 9, 1988, Chris-Craft filed for bankruptcy. Subsequent ownership changes In February 1989, the assets of Murray Chris-Craft were put up for auction by the court handling Chris-Craft's bankruptcy. A bidding war broke out between Genmar Holdings and the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC). The opening bid was set at $38.5M plus $5M for royalties and future sales of boats. OMC won the auction with a high bid of $58M. For its $58M, OMC acquired the tangible and intangible assets of Chris-Craft including the manufacturing facilities in Bradenton, Florida; Goshen, Indiana; and Swansboro, North Carolina. OMC also acquired the right to use the Chris-Craft name from Chris- Craft Industries in exchange for a yearly licensing fee of $500,000 plus 1% of Chris-Craft sales. OMC went into bankruptcy in 2000 and was purchased by Genmar Holdings. Genmar sold the Chris-Craft division in 2001 to Stellican Limited, a British private equity firm. Stellican then purchased the Chris- Craft trademark from News Corporation, thus reuniting the two parts of the company. On June 4, 2018, Chris-Craft was sold by Stellican to Winnebago Industries, the RV manufacturer.

RAM described itself as \\"a mass membership, broad left, grassroots movement of social change\\". Its national chair was Grant Morgan and its co-leaders were Oliver Woods and Grant Brookes. History Foundation RAM was formed in 2003 out of dissatisfaction by Auckland community activists with the control of local body politics by centre-left Labour-supported City Vision and centre- right National-supported Citizens and Ratepayers. RAM ran eight candidates for Auckland Regional Council in the 2004 local body elections and polled over 87,000 votes. One candidate, Robyn Hughes, was elected to the regional council. 2007 Auckland local elections RAM expanded its activities in the 2007 Auckland local body elections, running seven candidates for the Auckland Regional Council and six for Auckland City Council, as well as candidates for Auckland's three District Health Boards and Auckland City community boards. Despite receiving more than 117,016 votes Auckland wide, no RAM candidates were elected. In the Auckland Regional Council elections, its vote decreased, from 87,000 to 76,000.Declaration of result of election for the Auckland Regional Council 2007 elections, ARC, 17 October 2007 Across the board, the right made gains in Greater Auckland's 2007 council elections at the expense of both the centre-left (Labour-aligned tickets) and the left (RAM). 2008 parliamentary election In early 2008, RAM began to actively recruit to meet the 500 party member threshold required by the Electoral Commission for party registration. Later in the year, it achieved more than 2,000 registered members, to contest the 2008 general election. It applied for a broadcasting allocation.Commission to hear parties on broadcasting time and funding The party was registered by the Electoral Commission on 29 July 2008. RAM received 465 party votes in the 2008 Parliamentary elections, coming second-to-last. Policies RAM advocated a policy of free and frequent public transport, with the aims of alleviating traffic congestion, allowing improved transport means for Auckland residents and fighting against climate change. The other core messages of RAM were reducing rates on homeowners, shifting local taxation onto big business,RAM stands in 2007 council elections and removing doods and services tax from food.\\"Taking GST off food big help to family budgets\\", Howick and Pakuranga Times, 21 April 2008. The organisation had a very strong policy of anti-racism and particularly of supporting Muslim migrants to integrate into New Zealand society. It also called for an \\"Auckland Parliament\\" to co-ordinate local democracy in Auckland's five local cities, as an alternative to what it sees as an undemocratic \\"Super-City\\" body. RAM also organised against racism and Islamophobia in the city.Scoop: Leaders abhor mag's negative Muslim stereotyping It has sponsored peace marches in Auckland with Global Peace and Justice Auckland.Please take a stand for peace!

He was one of the architects of the devaluation of the Belgian Frank in 1982 when he worked at the cabinet of Wilfried Martens in the government Martens V. As governor of the NBB, he prepared the entry of Belgium to the euro in 1999. Career Verplaetse was born on 19 February 1930 in Zulte. After he graduated in commercial sciences from the Catholic University of Leuven, Alfons Verplaetse started his career at the National Bank in 1953, where he worked at the Research department. In 1982, in the government Martens V, he was seconded to the Prime Minister's Office as associate chief of staff, and subsequently as head of the Economic Office until 1987. Together with Jacques van Ypersele de Strihou, he was one of the architects of the economic recovery policy launched by the February 1982 devaluation of the Belgian franc. The plan was mainly conceived by four people meeting in Verplaetse's holiday residence in , a tiny village in the Ardennes. Later Poupehan became a term for backroom politics. He was appointed as a director of the NBB in 1985 and became vice-governor in 1988 and succeeded Jean Godeaux as governor in 1989. In 1990, the Belgian franc was linked to the German mark, in order to stabilise the Belgian currency. The reform of the Belgian monetary policy instruments in 1991 was another step to stabilise and improve the Belgian monetary situation. An important challenge of his tenure as governor of the NBB was the European monetary integration, which was initiated under Jacques Delors. Alfons Verplaetse became a member of the board of governors of the European Monetary Institute in 1994 and of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank in 1998. Verplaetse was supposed to retire in 1997, but remained in office until 1999 to oversee the introduction of the euro to replace the Belgian franc, on 1 January 1999, as the official currency of Belgium. He was succeeded by Guy Quaden as governor of the National Bank. On 10 March 1997, Verplaetse was elected President of the Bank for International Settlements. He was replaced on 8 February 1999 by Urban B√§ckstr√∂m. After his retirement, he made his expertise available in the service of economic and financial development in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The name \\"horridus\\" means bristly in Latin, likely referring to its spiny thorax.  Description  Lyttleton Females can reach up to (but are usually 12‚Äì15 cm), making this endemic species the longest New Zealand insect. A distinguishing feature is the coxa of the two forelegs is purple or pink. Females are much larger than males and have a visibly spiny thorax. Males are much skinnier and shorter, usually up to . The colour of A. horridus ranges from pale white to dark brown, with females usually being grey and males being a dark greenish-brown or dark brown.  Life cycle and mating behaviour  George Hudson Like many other New Zealand stick insects, A. horridus is facultatively parthenogenetic. Because of that, some populations consist of only females who reproduce asexually, while other populations have both males and females and can reproduce by either asexual or sexual reproduction. Adults hatch in early summer and can be seen hanging off their host plant, feeding on it. They are mostly active at night, with males actively searching for females. Males will mate with females by climbing on to their back, and using the toothed claspers near their genitalia to attach and begin copulation. Males may remain clasped onto a female, even if not mating, in order to mate-guard. Mature females lay eggs continuously throughout their adult life, indiscriminately dropping them to the ground. The large eggs resemble plant seeds, and are well-camouflaged on the forest floor. Eggs hatch in early spring, and nymphs resemble miniature adults. Like other stick insects, A. horridus is hemimetabolous, and nymphs grow by moulting, going through six instars until final adulthood. PHAS Phasmidae Argosarchus horridus egg1.png PHAS Phasmidae Argosarchus horridus egg2.png PHAS Phasmidae Argosarchus horridus egg3.png PHAS Phasmidae Argosarchus horridus egg4.png  Habitat and distribution  A. horridus is found throughout much of the North Island, as well as some parts of the South Island. It is present in coastal areas from sea level to at least 900 m a.s.l. The species is absent in the central South Island and in high-altitude areas. It has also been found on a number of offshore islands, including the Chatham Islands. On the Chatham Islands only females occur and this population was once considered a different species (A. schauinslandi). It can be found in gardens on ramarama (Lophomyrtus bullata) and in the wild on native and introduced Rubus species (Rosaceae) and climbing rata (Metrosideros perforata). Because of its wide distribution, range of host plants and the various habitats it is found in, A. horridus is considered an ecological generalist.

Career Born in Sidcup, Ricketts began his career at Charlton Athletic in 2000 but made no appearances for the first team. He had a loan spell at League One club MK Dons in the 2005‚Äì06 season, where he made his debut in the FA Cup 1st round tie at Lincoln City, he made three appearances before suffering a knee ligament injury. Despite the injury, his loan spell was extended for a second and third month, and he made seven league and cup appearances for MK Dons. At the end of the season, he was released by Charlton after the club decided not to offer him a new contract, and joined Ebbsfleet United in August 2006. He made 31 appearances for Ebbsfleet in the 2006‚Äì07 season, and his performances were rewarded with a new contract in May 2007. A knee injury that required surgery interrupted the beginning of Rickett's 2007‚Äì08 season, but he returned to the side at the end of September 2007 and went on to make 30 appearances that season. He was put on standby for the England C squad in February 2008, and collected a winners medal when Ebbsfleet won the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium in May 2008. He signed a new contract in June 2008. In June 2009, Ricketts signed for Conference South club Woking. In 2010, Ricketts was made club captain. Ricketts quickly became a fan favourite at Woking and went on to make over 200 league appearances before leaving in June 2016.

His wealth derived initially from his father, who was a successful businessman in Syria and backed his son in his early ventures. Embarking on a series of speculative property ventures, Halabi amassed a sizeable fortune himself. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2007, he was ranked 14th richest person in Britain, while the Forbes list of global billionaires listed him at no. 194 in 2007, with an estimated net worth of US $4.3 billion. In 2009, Forbes ranked him no. 224 with a reduced net worth of US $2.8 billion. Although he remains a private man, he is fond of conspicuous consumption, owning a large fleet of luxury cars including Bentleys and Rolls Royce Phantoms, as well as a 130-ft yacht. Downfall and bankruptcy In late 2007 the sports gym chain Esporta, which he had purchased for ¬£460m, was forced into administration, costing Halabi at least ¬£120m of his own money, and damaging his relationship with his main creditor, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. In January 2008, Halabi sold his one-third stake in the flagship Shard development in London for ¬£30m‚Äîa stake that had been valued at over ¬£130m six months earlier. Later that year the Mentmore Towers project, which Halabi had purchased in 1997 with a view to turning it into a six-star hotel, ran into problems. The grade II listed building was mothballed, with essential maintenance work remaining undone as the project architects sued Halabi for unpaid fees. In summer 2008 English Heritage ranked three of Halibi's assets as \\"Buildings at Risk\\". In June 2009, his group of property companies defaulted on $1.9 billion of bonds. The debts in question had been secured on nine London properties, which had fallen in value by up to 50% since the start of the credit crunch, leaving them in negative equity. In August 2009 insolvency specialists MCR were appointed as liquidators of Buckingham Securities Holdings, Halabi's principal client advisory vehicle. By October 2009, Halabi's Anglo Swiss Holdings company began to liquidate assets including the attempted sale of Cambridge House in Piccadilly, in central London, previously the premises of the Naval and Military Club. On 1 April 2010, he was declared bankrupt in the High Court in London. Halabi's Mentmore Towers development is still part of his property portfolio, although the scale of development for the property is much reduced and no longer includes the large extension with spa and conference facilities. Ch√¢teau Cantenac-Brown in the Bordeaux district of France was also to form part of the luxury hotel group linking the PM (Piccadilly / Mentmore) properties and including spa facilities but was sold in December 2019.http://www.vsnews.fr/ Aviva Tower, part of Halabi's White Tower portfolio, was eventually sold for ¬£288m in April 2011; it had been purchased in 2003 for ¬£260m. Personal life Halabi is married to Lithuanian-born Urte, with two sons, Samuel and Jacob; Samuel died in August 2003 in a pool accident in France. Halabi was convicted of sexual assault in France in 1998. The attack occurred at his house in France, against a woman whom he had trapped and threatened to kill if she reported the crime. Though Halabi was handed a three-year prison sentence, suspended for five years, and placed on a sex offender list in France, he was able to continue his life and business dealings unchecked as he had been convicted under the name Mohammed Halabi instead of his actual name. While the conviction was shared with UK authorities under data sharing agreements in 2012, the crime was not linked to Halabi until 2017.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/04/billionaire-rapist-travelled- world-unchecked-blunder-uk-authorities/ In February 2015, he was accused of assaulting and racially abusing a binman in Hay's Mews, off London's Berkeley Square, after a refuse truck had blocked his Bentley outside Annabel's, allegedly calling him a \\"monkey\\" and a \\"peasant\\", and then shouting \\"I own this road, I can do what I want\\". In December 2016, following a near-two year investigation and a week long trial at Southwark Crown Court, he was acquitted of racially aggravated assault.

The group plays a mixture of melodic punk, frequently with two-part vocal lines, and noisy, dissonant hardcore, often at extreme speeds. The band never attained commercial success, but enjoys popularity in certain underground circuits, particularly in Europe. They were referenced in lyric by fellow Philadelphia-area rock group the Dead Milkmen in the songs \\"Nutrition\\" and \\"Milkmen Stomp.\\" History Formed in 1982, the band played its first show with Minor Threat and Agnostic Front, and would go on to share the stage with thousands of other groups. Singer and guitarist Jim McMonagle first formed the band with bassist Zeke Zagar and drummer Mike Giannone, although Zagar was replaced after a few months by Dave Rochon. Zagar later formed the Philadelphia skate punk band McRad. Flag of Democracy's debut 7\\" Love Songs was released in 1984 on Philadelphia's Speed Of Sound Records. It was followed two years later with the debut LP, Shatter Your Day. In this same year Giannone was replaced by Michigan-based drummer Bob Walker, completing the group's lineup that has lasted over 25 years. This was followed by extensive touring and the release of the 23, Down with People, Schneller! (a live record), Hate Rock and Everything Sucks albums, the latter four on the German label Bitzcore Records. Several European tours saw Rochon substituted with temporary bassists. For their 2000 album FOD World, the band worked with Philadelphia-area label Creep Records. Their most recently recorded album, Home Lobotomy Kit, had been tied up in complications and awaiting release since 2005, but finally saw the light of day on Mother Box records in 2010. On November 30, 2007, F.O.D. played their 25th Anniversary Show in Philadelphia at the First Unitarian Church. In 2012, the band started reissuing and remastering their back catalog on SRA Records. The first instalment is Shatter Your Day, which has been expanded to a double LP containing their entire output from Giannone's four-year tenure.

Although similar to a backpack, the single shoulder strap differentiates this type from other backpacks. There are exceptions to this general rule. Origins The word haversack is an adaptation of the German Hafersack and also the Dutch haverzak meaning \\"oat sack\\", (which more properly describes a small cloth bag on a strap worn over one shoulder and originally referred to the bag of oats carried as horse fodder). The term was adopted by both the English and French (as havresac) cavalry in the 17th century.Haversack in The Oxford English Dictionary The word haver likewise means \\"oats\\" in Northern English and Scottish dialects. The haversack, especially when used in the military, was generally square and about 12 inches (30 cm) per side with a button-down flap to close it. When empty, the bag could be folded in three and an extra button on the back of the bag would allow it to be refixed in this position. For the military, this made it neat and, when held to the side in its folded form by the soldier's belt, it became part of the uniform of many regiments in the British army. General usage In Australia and elsewhere, the word haversack is synonymous with rucksack or other similar terms and is used to describe any backpack or more than one backpack. U.S. Army Wearing the full M-1928 (M28) infantry haversack, this US soldier wears the old style blue denim fatigues Haversacks were in use during the American Civil War, as recounted in Grant's memoirs, \\"In addition to the supplies transported by boat, the men were to carry forty rounds of ammunition in the cartridge-boxes and four days' rations in haversacks.\\"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant, Grant, Kindle location 12783 In 1910, the U.S. Army adopted the M1910 haversack as the standard pack for all infantrymen. The pack is essentially a sheet of canvas that folds around its contents (clothing, daily rations, and assorted personal items), and is held together by adjustable straps that thread through loops. A \\"tail\\" threaded onto the bottom of the haversack with a leather strap is intended to hold the bedroll, and can be detached from the haversack without disturbing the contents of the pack. Shoulder straps and a single rear strap are designed to attach to a cartridge belt in a suspender configuration. The exterior of the pack has grommets for attaching a bayonet scabbard, a mess kit pouch, and a canvas carrier for a short-handled shovel (entrenching tool). The M1910 haversack continued production during the interwar years with minor modifications \\"An upgraded haversack was developed in 1928 that had quick release buckles and a web strap and buckle closure on the meat can pouch replacing the metal button. However, the M-1928 haversack did not go into production until 1940, and older haversacks continued to be issued until stocks were exhausted.\\" The M-1944 Combat Pack was developed from the much lighter and user-friendly US Marine Corps M-1941 Jungle pack which was developed during the Banana Wars which required a lighter pack in the tropics. The M-1944 pack had some shortcomings and a new M-1945 began replacing earlier packs in February 1945. The two packs had incompatible combat and cargo packs due to different release buckles. The new two-part design, based on the Marine M-1941 jungle pack, used a much smaller back pack (for rations, clothes, ammunition, and messkit), and a separate cargo bag that attached to the bottom for extra clothes, shoes, and miscellaneous other items. The upper field pack had the same type of grommet tabs and loops as the M-1928 for attaching a bayonet and entrenchment tool plus straps for securing a \\"horseshoe\\" bedroll. The M-1936 field bag was a copy of the British officers Musette bag of World War I and to be issued to officers and mounted personnel. It was a smaller pack lacking shoulder straps and could be attached to a set of cotton web suspenders or carried by a single general purpose shoulder strap. It intended to carry rations, mess gear, and other essential items. It was smaller as less essential gear would be carried on a vehicle. U.S. Marine Corps The Marines carried the M-1910 haversack and somewhat improved M-1928 haversack in both world wars, but they also developed their own exclusive pack system in 1941. The M-1910 haversack was considered too overweight and cumbersome for jungle fighting in the tropics of Central America during the Banana Wars years. A more versatile two-part M-1941 system was devised. This comprised an upper \\"marching pack\\" for rations, poncho and clothes, and a lower knapsack for extra shoes and utilities. The exterior of the upper pack had loops and grommet tabs for attaching a bayonet, shovel, bedroll, extra canteen, and first-aid pouch. It was issued in tan or khaki canvas.The Marine Corps M1941 Pack System See also * Messenger bag References External links * 1st Pattern M1910 Haversacks (archive.org link) Category:Bags Category:Personal military carrying equipment ","title":"Haversack"},{"id":"10961552","text":"Sepulchre of Constance in the Church San Juan del Hospital (Valencia). The inscription translates as Here lies Lady Constance Augusta, Empress of Greece Anna of Hohenstaufen (1230 ‚Äì April 1307), born Constance, was an Empress of Nicaea. She was a daughter of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Bianca Lancia. Empress She married Nicaean Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes as part of an alliance between her father and her husband. Some historians regard the alliance as a result of their common hostility to the papacy.Alice Gardner, The Lascarids of Nicaea: the Story of an Empire in Exile (1912‚Äì1913) The marriage occurred in 1244; it is recorded by the chronicles of both George Acropolites and George Pachymeres. Constance took the name Anna following her marriage. Constance was only 14, and was accompanied to Nicaea by a governess, the Marchesa della Fricca. According to George Acropolites the governess became the mistress of John III and \\"rival in love\\" of Anna. In time the Marchesa came to have considerable influence at court. Nicephorus Blemmydes called her \\"rival empress\\". However Blemmydes' negative criticism resulted in an attempt at his life by her followers. Blemmydes survived, and Marchesa lost the favor of John III, who dismissed her from court. Blemmydes' account was later included in his autobiography. Widow Constance remained empress until the death of her husband on 3 November 1254. Her stepson Theodore II Laskaris succeeded to the throne. By that time Frederick II had also died. Pachymeres records her staying in Nicaea through the reigns of both Theodore II (1254‚Äì1258) and her step-grandson John IV Laskaris (1259‚Äì1261). Alice Gardner suggested that she was still politically useful as a hostage against the remaining members of the House of Hohenstaufen, particularly her brother Manfred of Sicily. John IV was underage through his brief reign. His regent and co-ruler was Michael VIII Palaiologos, who maneuvered John IV aside. After the Nicaeans regained Constantinople and re-established the Byzantine Empire, Michael deposed John IV and later blinded him. According to Pachymeres, around this time Michael fell in love with Anna and attempted to marry her, but the widowed Empress rejected him. Deno Geanakoplos points out \\"what militates against Pachymeres' statement, however, is the question why Michael, merely for love of Anna, would be willing to risk almost certain excommunication by the Patriarch Arsenios without the gaining of an important political benefit.\\" Michael's aim was to gain an alliance with Manfred, but with Anna's refusal, the anger of his own wife, and threat of ecclesiastical censure by Arsenios, Michael dropped the proposal. She was given magnificent presents and allowed to leave the new court for the Kingdom of Sicily in 1263. This gesture secured the release of Michael's general Alexios Strategopoulos, who had been captured by the Despot of Epirus, Michael II Komnenos Doukas. Again known as Constance, she joined the court of Manfred. When he was killed at the Battle of Benevento (1266) and was succeeded by his victorious enemy Charles of Anjou, Constance fled Sicily for Aragon, where her niece, Manfred's daughter Constance, was the consort of Crown Prince Peter. She remained for some time at the court of King James I of Aragon, but eventually retired as a nun to a monastery in Valencia, where she died.

The squadron used traditional military communications systems such as the Defense Switch Network (DSN), the Automated Digital Network (AUTODIN), and Defense Messaging System (DMS), as well as off-the- shelf commercial communications systems. Unit history The 231st began on 1 February 1952, when the 8205th Air Base Squadron was activated. The unit's mission was to receive, maintain, and store equipment as well as provide trained personnel for the soon-to-be formed 231st Airways and Air Communications Service (AACS) Squadron (Mobile) which was to be stationed at Camp Simms, Washington, DC). The unit was inactivated on 26 August 1952, when its personnel and equipment were transferred to the 231st AACS Sq (Mobile). Vietnam era On 1 July 1961, the 231st AACS Sq (Mobile) was renamed the 231st Mobile Communications Squadron. The unit kept this name until January 1966, when the unit became the 231st Mobile Communications Squadron (Bare Base). A separate 231st Flight Facilities Flight (FFF) assumed air traffic control functions. In 1968, the words \\"Bare Base\\" were removed from the Squadron designation, and the unit mobilized for the Pueblo Crisis. Activated for two weeks, the 231st was demobilized on 17 April of that year. In 1969, the 231st saw its first change of command when Lt. Col. Tuckerman retired and was replaced by Maj. Charles Milton. Tuckerman's 17 years as commanding officer was the longest of any commander in the history of the 231st. By 1971, the 231st had a role in both federal and state support with its participation in the DC National Guard's Task Force Blue. This mission enabled the 231st to provide civil support to the District of Columbia during times of civil disturbance or to aid the Metropolitan Police Department by being deputized for other events. The 231st took part in various civil missions, including the 1961 Nikita Khrushchev visit to the United States, the 1963 Civil Rights March. In 1972, the Flight Facilities Flight was merged into the 231st, and on 8 December 1972 the unit was inactivated and returned to the National Guard Bureau. The unit was renamed the 231st Mobile Communications Squadron (Tactical Air Base) to reflect its standalone capability. Cold War era In May 1976, the word \\"Mobile\\" was replaced by \\"Combat\\" in the Squadron's official designation. That year saw another change to the Squadron's operations as it began to move from its home at Camp Simms to Andrews Air Force Base. The buildings to be occupied by the 231st began construction in July 1976, and they were completed by August 1978. The unit accomplished its first overseas deployment in 1981 when members of the squadron participated at Exercise Flintlock 81 in England. The 231st provided the Air National Guard's first radar approach control operations in 1983 at Martinsburg, and it also pioneered the Air Guard's first airspace surveillance support to Camp David beginning in 1983. In 1985, the unit was renamed the 231st Combat Information Systems Squadron. In October 1986, it was renamed again, getting its current designation, the 231st Combat Communications Squadron. At the end of the Cold War the unit began a new era of operations with Operations Desert Shield and Storm. During Operational Display Determination in 1991, the unit deployed 20 members to Turkey to support humanitarian assistance to the Kurds in Northern Iraq. In 1999 the unit again responded when the squadron received a Presidential Selective Reserve Call-Up (PSRC) for operations in the NATO Bosnia and Kosovo Campaigns. Twenty-first century During the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the unit was active in setting up a static ground communications system to support the 113th Wing's airfield operations in establishing combat air patrols over the nation's capital. In January 2003 the unit was called by the 1st Air Force to provide communications command and control in support of the Integrated Air Defense (IAD) of the National Capital Region during the 2003 Presidential State of the Union Address. Twenty personnel from the unit volunteered to pack up 60 short tons of equipment to support Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Three members of the unit were deployed into the combat theater during Operation Iraqi Freedom, while another 12 personnel worked at the Air National Guard's Crisis Action Team from 2001 to 2004 in support of Operation Noble Eagle. In 2004, the unit began to receive the new Theatre Deployable Communications gear, technology designed to transmit and receive communications anywhere in the world. The system is designed to reduce the communication problems normally associated with airlift and manpower. During Hurricane Isabel in October 2003, the unit provided equipment to the 911 Emergency Response Center in Baltimore. This was the first time that the DC Air National Guard had provided equipment support outside of the District to another State. During Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, members of the unit deployed to New Orleans and Pineville, LA to provide communications in support of recovery efforts. In 2007, the 231st Combat Communications Squadron was designated for inactivation, effective March 2008. During its lifetime, the 231st won 5 Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards.

It was established in 1999 by former NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Harley Race. Students of the school are incorporated into the professional wrestling promotion World League Wrestling. History School The Harley Race Wrestling Academy is operated by Harley Race. It provides training programs for those looking to enter the professional wrestling industry. The objective of the program is to \\"Teach safe wrestling technique, draw on Harley Race's experience and to give students tools to succeed in professional wrestling\\". Programs include both courses to become a professional wrestler, which requires anywhere between 300‚Äì500 hours of training, and professional wrestling referee training, which entails 60 hours of training. The school has two wrestling rings and weight room. The school is attended mostly by men, but occasionally women join as well. The school initially put on local wrestling events that raised money for local charities in Missouri. The wrestling school later began a running partnership with Pro Wrestling Noah that includes many of the program's talent touring with the Japanese-based wrestling promotion. YouTube celebrity OutlawDipper has stated in his previous videos that he attends this wrestling school and lives in Eldon, Missouri. History of World League Wrestling Logo of World League Wrestling. In 1999, Race began World Legion Wrestling, (WLW), an independent professional wrestling promotion that integrates current and past students of the Harley Race Wrestling Academy. At first they did television for the America One Television Network, and added their show to the weekly line-up of a different wrestling promotion every night at 11:00 p.m. eastern time. After they lost their TV, they changed their name to World League Wrestling, and continued promoting in the Missouri area. World League Wrestling is based out of Troy, Missouri, and puts on approximately 60 shows a year. The slogan for the company is Shut up and wrestle, which expresses its theme of more old- school wrestling and less \\"showboating\\". The promotion is family-style professional wrestling entertainment that excludes nudity and swearing. The shows also sometimes features guest wrestlers.

Description Cotyledon orbiculata is an extremely variable species that grows to approximately in height. It has gray-green leaves that can be up to with a white powdery substance on them that helps reflect sunlight and conserve water. The shape of the leaves was thought to have a resemblance to a pig's ear, thus the common name. The bell-shaped flowers are small, usually less than in length, and droop from the top of a tall stalk. The flowers are usually orange-red but yellow varieties also exist. The tubular flower crown has no bulges and is 20 millimeters long and up to 9 millimeters in diameter. The bent back crown tips are orange, red or yellow and are 12 millimeters long. The stamens protrude 2 to 3 millimeters. The yellow anthers are elongated and 1.75 millimeters in diameter. The slightly transversely elongated nectar scales are dull and yellowish green and are 1.5 √ó 2 millimeters in size. The 10 stamens are attached to the base of the corolla (2 per petal), and the 5 carpels each have a style longer than the ovary.

Uses Cotyledon orbiculata has a number of medicinal uses. In South Africa, the fleshy part of the leaf is applied to warts and corns. Heated leaves are used as poultices for boils and other inflammations. Single leaves may be eaten as a vermifuge and the juice has been used to treat epilepsy. However, the leaves contain a bufanolide called cotyledontoxin, which is toxic to sheep, goats, horses, cattle, poultry, and dogs, causing a condition known as cotyledonosis.

Early life Perron was born in Portneuf in 1866, and moved to Egg Lake in what is now Sturgeon County, Alberta in February 1883, after hearing Bishop Vital- Justin Grandin encouraging francophones to move west. In 1892 he married Lina Lalibert√©, and soon after moved to St. Albert. Business career In 1896, Perron acquired the Windsor Hotel in St. Albert, which he operated for four years before selling it. In 1900, he opened a brick factory and purchased a general store which he operated with Cheri Hebert until 1907, when he bought out Hebert. In 1912, he re-entered the hotel business by becoming President of the Royal Hotel Company Limited, which opened the Royal Hotel in 1913 to replace another hotel that had burned down. Though the hotel was \\"the best north of Edmonton, the advent of Prohibition in 1915 put an end to its viability, and it was soon closed and demolished. In the meantime, in 1914, he and Hebert had acquired a paddleboat called the Ste. Theresa which they used to offer recreational trips on the Sturgeon River and Big Lake. When water levels in the river fell too low for the boat to operate, it was relocated to Lac Ste. Anne, where it was eventually destroyed in a storm. In 1919 his general store was destroyed in a fire, and he opened a butcher shop. He operated this until the mid-twenties, when he moved to California with his son, Alex Perron, to attempt to go into business there. His attempts were unsuccessful, and he returned to St. Albert shortly thereafter. Upon his return, he rented another general store which he operated until his death. Public service Though he had been one of many St. Albert residents to sign a petition in 1898 protesting the previously unincorporated community's incorporation as a village, Perron was nevertheless elected to the first St. Albert Town Council in 1904 as a councillor. He served in this capacity until 1907, when he was elected mayor. He served one one-year term as mayor before leaving political life altogether. In 1906, Perron became the first lieutenant of the St. Albert Troop of Squadron D, of the St. Albert Mounted Rifles. In 1912, he co-founded the St. Albert Chamber of Commerce, and served as its first Vice President. He was also the first President of the Alberta French Canadian Association. Family, Death, and Legacy Fleuri and Lina Perron had nine children, six of whom survived infancy. His son, Alex Perron himself served as a mayor of St. Albert. Another son, Eugene, married Evelyn Hogan, daughter of Michael Hogan, the longest-serving mayor in St. Albert's history. Fleuri Perron died in 1931. Perron Street, a major street in St. Albert's downtown, is named in his honour. It was renamed in 1967 from Piron Street. The town council at the time claimed that it was only correcting a misspelling and that the road had always been intended to be named in Perron's honour, but an alternative theory states that it had been originally named in honour of France's Piron family, which had donated the bells for the St. Albert mission.

The word's further origins in Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European are unclear. History Throughout history there has not been a consistent definition of the term \\"witch\\". Johannes Nider and other 15th century writers used the Latin term maleficus to mean witch‚Äïa person who performed maleficium, harmful acts of sorcery, against others. The witch hunts of medieval Europe differed from pre-Christian practices in condemning the witch as a moral corruption, rather than focusing on whether the act of sorcery was harmful, expanding the customary understanding of the maleficium concept. The introduction of the idea of demonic forces empowering the acts of maleficium gave the term \\"witch\\" new connotations of idolatry and apostasy that were adopted by Malleus maleficarum, but these remained disputed despite papal injunctions to take action against witches.Bailey, M. D. (2010). Battling Demons: Witchcraft, Heresy, and Reform in the Late Middle Ages. (n.p.): Pennsylvania State University Press. Germanic etymology The Old English verb wiccian has a cognate in Middle Low German wicken (attested from the 13th century, besides wichelen \\"to bewitch\\"). The further etymology of this word is problematic. It has no clear cognates in Germanic outside of English and Low German, and there are numerous possibilities for the Indo- European root from which it may have been derived. *The OED states that the noun is \\"apparently\\" deverbal (derived from wiccian), but for the verb merely states that it is \\"of obscure origin\\". *Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch connects the \\"Ingvaeonic word\\" *wikk≈çn with Gothic weihs \\"sacred\\" (Proto-Indo European (PIE) *weik- \\"to separate, to divide\\", probably via early Germanic practices of cleromancy such as those reported by Tacitus,Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde IV, p. 506.Grimm's view is repeated by the Online Etymology Dictionary: \\"possible connection to Gothic weihs \\"holy\\" and Germanic weihan \\"consecrate,\\" s, \\"the priests of a suppressed religion naturally become magicians to its successors or opponents.\\" *Grimm also considers *weik- \\"to curve, bend\\" (which became wicken \\"hop, dance\\") and *weg'h- \\"to move\\" (in a sense of \\"to make mysterious gestures\\"). *R. L√ºhrR. L√ºhr, Expressivit√§t und Lautgesetz im Germanischen, Heidelberg (1988), p. 354 connects wigol \\"prophetic, mantic\\", wƒ´glian \\"to practice divination\\" (Middle Low German wichelen \\"bewitch\\", wicker \\"soothsayer\\") and suggests Proto-Germanic *wig≈çn, geminated (c.f. Kluge's law) to *wikk≈çn. The basic form would then be the feminine, wicce < *wikk√¶ < *wikk≈çn with palatalization due to the preceding i and the following *√¶ < *≈çn in early Ingvaeonic. The palatal -cc- in wicca would then be analogous to the feminine. **An alternative possibility is to derive the palatal directly from the verb wiccian < *wikkija.OED, s.v. witch L√ºhr conversely favours derivation of this verb from the noun. *The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language connects PIE *weg'- \\"rouse\\" (English wake), and offers the Proto-Germanic reconstruction *wikkjaz \\"one who wakes the dead\\".The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 4th Edition, online (2000): witch and *weg-. Accessed 3 May 2006. From Old to Modern English The Middle English word wicche did not differentiate between feminine and masculine, however the masculine meaning became less common in Standard English, being replaced by words like \\"wizard\\" and \\"warlock\\". The modern spelling witch with the medial 't' first appears in the 16th century. In current colloquial English \\"witch\\" is almost exclusively applied to women, and the OED has \\"now only dialectal\\" for the masculine noun. Figurative use to refer to a bewitching young girl begins in the 18th century,Samuel Richardson, Pamela; or virtue rewarded (1739‚Äì40) has: \\"Mrs. Jervis, said he, take the little witch from me\\" while wiche as a contemptuous term for an old woman is attested since the 15th century. \\"A witch of Endor\\" (alluding to ) as a fanciful term for a medium appears in 19th-century literature. The meaning \\"an adherent of Wicca\\" (male or female) is due to Gerald Gardner's purported \\"Witch Cult\\", and now appears as a separate meaning of the word also in mainstream dictionaries. For example, Meriam-Webster currently distinguishes four meanings of the noun witch, :1. one that is credited with usually malignant supernatural powers; especially: a woman practicing usually black witchcraft often with the aid of a devil or familiar : sorceress ‚Äì compare warlock :2. an ugly old woman: hag :3. a charming or alluring girl or woman :4. a practitioner of Wicca Other suggestions for the underlying root are untenable or widely rejected: * Grimm reject a connection with *wek- \\"speak\\", suggested by P. Lessiak (ZfDA 53, 1912). *Walter William SkeatPrinciples of English Etymology (2 series, 1887 and 1891) derived the word from PIE *weid-, Old English wita \\"wise man, wizard\\" and witan \\"to know\\", considering it a corruption of an earlier *witga. No Old English spelling with -t- is known, and this etymology is not accepted today. *Robert Graves in his 1948 The White Goddess, in discussing the willow which was sacred to the Greek goddess Hecate, connects the word to a root *wei- which connotes bending or pliance,whence English weak; Grimm s.v. Weide by saying: \\"Its connection with witches is so strong in Northern Europe, that the words 'witch' and 'wicked' are derived from the same ancient word for willow, which also yields 'wicker'.\\" This confounds English and Scandinavian evidence, since the weak root in English has no connection with willows, and Old Norse has no word for \\"witch\\" cognate to the English.wicker an East Scandinavian loan, entering the English language in the 14th century. The English cognate of the root yields withy, and the \\"willow\\" word in all old Germanic languages has the dental (Old Norse v√≠√∞ir). The wicker word is in fact from the *weik- root employed for \\"hop, dance\\" etymology considered by Grimm, irrespective of willows. See Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. witch n2, witch, wych n3. (Online edition, accessed 5/9/07) Old English Old English also had h√¶gtesse \\"witch, fury\\", whence Modern English hag, of uncertain origin, but cognate to German Hexe, from an Old High German haga-zussa, Common Germanic *haga-tusjon- (OED), perhaps from a *tesvian \\"to mar, damage\\", meaning \\"field-damager\\" (the suggestion of Grimm). The element hag- originally means \\"fence, wooden enclosure\\", and hence also \\"enclosed fields, cultivated land\\". Other Old English synonyms of wicca and wicce include gealdricge, scinl√¶ce, hellr√∫ne. The Old English plural form for both the masculine and feminine nouns was wiccan (\\"witches\\") and wiccecr√¶ft was \\"witchcraft\\". The earliest recorded use of the word is in the Laws of √Ülfred, which date to about 890:Oxford English Dictionary Online, 2nd Edition (1989).Bosworth, Joseph & T. Northcote Toller. (1998) An Anglo-Saxon dictionary, based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth; edited and enlarged by T. Northcote Toller. Oxford: Oxford University Press (reprint of 1898 edition). :Tha faemnan, the gewuniath onfon gealdorcraeftigan and scinlaecan and wiccan, ne laet thu tha libban. :Women who are accustomed to receiving enchanters and sorceresses and witches, do not let them live! In the homilies of the Old English grammarian √Ülfric, dating to the late 10th century we find: :Ne sceal se cristena befrinan tha fulan wiccan be his gesundfulnysse. :A Christian should not consult foul witches concerning his prosperity. In both these examples wiccan is the plural noun, not an adjective. The adjective fulan (foul) can mean \\"physically unclean\\" as well as \\"morally or spiritually unclean\\" or \\"wicked\\". In Old English glossaries the words wicce and wicca are used to gloss such Latin terms as augur, hariolus, conjector, and pythonyssa, all of which mean \\"diviner\\", \\"soothsayer\\", which suggests a possible role of fortune-teller for the witch in Anglo-Saxon times. The word wicca is associated with animistic healing rites in Halitgar's Latin Penitential where it is stated that :Some men are so blind that they bring their offering to earth-fast stone and also to trees and to wellsprings, as the witches teach, and are unwilling to understand how stupidly they do or how that dead stone or that dumb tree might help them or give forth health when they themselves are never able to stir from their place. The phrase swa wiccan t√¶ca√æ (\\"as the witches teach\\") seems to be an addition to Halitgar's original, added by an 11th-century Old English translator.

After training with Third Division club, Plymouth Argyle, Opinel was given a short-term contract so that manager Paul Sturrock could take a closer look him over the 2000 Christmas and New Year period. He made only one appearance for Plymouth in a Football League Trophy tie against Bristol Rovers and was not offered a contract. After a trial at Bournemouth, he joined Leyton Orient in February 2001, where he made eleven appearances in the remainder of the 2000‚Äì01 season, scoring one goal against Cardiff City, and helped Orient towards the Third Division play-offs in May 2001. Opinel then dropped into non-league football, joining Billericay Town at the beginning of the 2001‚Äì02 season. He joined Farnborough Town in July 2003, signing a two-year contract in May 2004, but requested a transfer for personal and professional reasons and joined Crawley Town in January 2005 in a deal that saw Farnborough receive a substantial transfer fee as well as Robert Traynor move from Crawley to Farnborough. Opinel had started over 50 games for Farnborough. Opinel agreed a contract until May 2006 with Crawley and in July 2006, he joined Gravesend & Northfleet (now Ebbsfleet United). He signed a new contract in May 2007 and collected a winners medal when Ebbsfleet won the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium in May 2008. On 4 June 2009, Opinel re-joined Farnborough.

Originally launched in 1995, and relaunched in 2005, Nickelodeon is based in Berlin. The channel is available on subscription services and as an unscrambled, free-to-air (FTA) satellite signal. On 31 March 2010, the channel re-adopted the name Nickelodeon on air and online, in addition to the new Nickelodeon logo and graphical package being rolled out internationally at the time.\\"MTV goes global with Nickelodeon\\". Techwatch Tech News ‚Äì Rapid TV News. February 22, 2010. Since then, the channel is also broadcast in English in addition to German on a secondary audio track. Unlike other Nickelodeon feeds and like the Dutch counterpart, the end credits on shows do not appear. They were replaced by short credits including the show name, production year and production company. History 1995‚Äì1998 The original version of Nickelodeon was launched on 5 July 1995 on the DFS Kopernikus satellite and a few cable providers in North Rhine-Westphalia. Nickelodeon initially aired for 6 hours per day; during off-air hours, the channel looped a half-hour special featuring excerpts from its shows. Beginning in October 1995, Nickelodeon aired from 6:00am until 8:00pm, and timeshared with Arte starting in 1996. After Der Kinderkanal launched, Nickelodeon lost its slot on many cable providers and began timesharing with VH-1 Germany on satellite. Nickelodeon was a failure and continually lost money due to weak advertising sales and its inability to compete against its more successful rival, Der Kinderkanal. As a result, Nickelodeon closed on 31 May 1998. Nickelodeon's owner Viacom soon thereafter struck a deal with RTL owner the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de T√©l√©diffusion (CLT, formerly known as the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion, CLR) to broadcast their programming on RTL's own children's channel, Super RTL (which, ironically, was a joint venture between RTL and Disney) in addition to a weekend morning Nicktoons block on the main RTL channel. After VH-1 Germany shut down in 2001 (and was replaced by a pan-European feed on a separate channel), it was replaced with MTV2 Pop. Relaunch, 2005‚Äì2010 On 7 April 2005 it was announced that on 12 September 2005 Nickelodeon Germany will be relaunched under the name Nick as a new channel.Nickelodeon kehrt als Nick nach Deutschland zur√ºck Nick started with a prime-time programming block called Nick Comedy that aired sitcoms and other comedy shows.

Almost 478 species of birds (both migratory and resident) have been spotted at the park, including 25 globally threatened and 21 near threatened species. The park has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by Birdlife International for the conservation of the avifaunal species. Waterfowl breeds in or passing through Kaziranga includes several rare species of geese (lesser white-fronted goose), and ducks (ferruginous pochard, Baer's pochard). Other rare riverine birds include kingfishers (Blyth's kingfisher), herons (white-bellied heron), pelicans (Dalmatian pelican, spot-billed pelican), shanks (spotted greenshank) and terns (black-bellied tern). Rare migratory storks and cranes are also seen wintering in the park (lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, Asian openbill). Kaziranga hosts a large number of raptors, considered a sign of a healthy ecosystem. This includes the rare eastern imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle, white-tailed fishing eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle and the lesser kestrel. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. About 99% of the stable vulture population was killed by kidney failure caused by consuming the veterinary drug diclofenac in domestic animal carcasses. Of these, the red-headed vulture, and Eurasian black vulture are still near threatened due to their large range, but the Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture and the Indian white-rumped vulture have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have similar losses -- the griffon vulture and the Himalayan griffon, but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of this many vultures creates a critical void in the scavengers' ecological niche in Kaziranga.R Cuthbert, RE Green, S Ranade, S Saravanan, DJ Pain, V Prakash, AA Cunningham (2006) \\" Rapid population declines of Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus) in India\\", Animal Conservation 9 (3), 349‚Äì354. . Retrieved on 2007-02-26 Rare game birds (which were once hunted) include partridges (swamp francolin), bustards (Bengal florican) and pigeons (pale- capped pigeon). Several other important families of birds inhabit Kaziranga, including rare species of hornbills (great Indian hornbill and the lesser risk wreathed hornbill), Old World babblers (Jerdon's babbler, marsh babbler) and weaver birds (the common baya weaver and the threatened Finn's weaver), thrushes (Hodgson's bushchat), Old World warblers (bristled grassbird). Other threatened species include the black-breasted parrotbill and rufous-vented prinia.

It is native to parts of the east and midwest United States, primarily the Great Lakes States, the Ohio Valley, and the Upper Mississippi Valley, as far north as central Minnesota. Trillium nivale is a perennial herbaceous plant that flowers late winter or early spring, occasionally while snow is still on the ground. Along the Ohio River valley, flowers may be seen in early March. At its northern limit in Minnesota, it blooms in early April. Along with the eastern skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus), T. nivale is one of the earliest flowering spring ephemerals. Given its winter hardiness, one would expect the range of T. nivale to extend farther north, but curiously this is not the case. Soon after pollination the pedicel turns downward, so that by the time the fruit is mature, it is hanging below the leaves. In June, the seeds are shed and the entire portion of the plant above ground suddenly disappears. The seeds are dispersed by ants, which may account for the low genetic diversity reported in some plant populations. Trillium nivale is smaller than many of the other species in the genus, seldom reaching a height of more than . Unlike most trilliums, it does not grow in leaf mold, preferring limy sandy gravel, crevices in limestone, or calcareous mineral soil. Like other Trillium species, T. nivale has a one-leaf vegetative stage followed by a three-leaf vegetative (juvenile) stage. After twelve or more years of vegetative growth, the plant finally reaches its three-leaf reproductive (flowering) stage. In some populations, there may be ten or more one-leaf plants to each flowering plant. The latter has an indefinite life span of many years, often living for decades.

The module's design is similar to the Mir Docking Module launched on STS-74 in 1995. Rassvet is primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft. It was flown to the ISS aboard on the STS-132 mission on 14 May 2010, and was connected to the ISS on 18 May 2010. The hatch connecting Rassvet with the ISS was first opened on 20 May 2010. On 28 June 2010, the Soyuz TMA-19 spacecraft performed the first docking with the module.  Details  Rassvet in the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. An interior view of Rassvet. Rassvet was docked to the nadir port of Zarya with help from the Canadarm2. Rassvet carried externally attached outfitting equipment from NASA for the Nauka Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM), a spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm, Nauka's experiment airlock for launching cubesats, and a radiator. Delivering Rassvet thus enabled NASA to fulfill its promise to ship 1.4 metric tons to equip the MLM. Rassvet has two docking units: one to attach to the nadir port of the Zarya module, and one to provide a docking port for a Soyuz or Progress spacecraft. It implements the role of the Docking and Stowage Module from the original ISS design. Russia announced the cancellation of the last of the two planned Russian Research Modules when it announced the plans for Rassvet.  Initial planning  The initial ISS plan included a Docking and Stowage Module (DSM). This planned Russian element was intended to provide facilities for stowage and an additional docking port, and would have been launched to the station on a Proton launch vehicle. The DSM would have been mounted to Zarya's nadir (Earth-facing) docking port. It would have been similar in size and shape to the Zarya module. The DSM was cancelled due to Russian budgetary constraints for some time, but its design was eventually modified into the Docking and Cargo Module (Rassvet) that was to be connected to the same Zarya location to provide stowage space and a docking port. During the cancellation period, it was proposed that a Multi Purpose Module (MPM) called Enterprise should be docked to Zarya, and later the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) was proposed to be located there as well, but the Enterprise module has since been cancelled and the MLM will be docked to Zvezda's nadir port instead.  Purpose  Rassvet was designed as a solution to two problems facing the ISS partners: # NASA was under contract to carry the MLM outfitting equipment into space. # The overlapping missions of the Progress, Soyuz, and ATV spacecraft highlighted the need to have four Russian docking ports available on the ISS. The cancellation of both Russian Research Modules meant that the ISS would be left with just three such docking ports after the installation of the Permanent Multipurpose Module in 2011, which made the nadir port of Zarya unusable. Rassvet solved both of these issues. NASA did not need to add another payload flight to accommodate the MLM outfitting equipment, as it could attach the hardware to the exterior of MRM-1. The ISS now had 4 docking ports available on the Russian segment: the aft port of Zvezda, the port of Pirs, later MLM (on the nadir port of Zvezda), the port of MRM-2 (on the zenith port of Zvezda), and the port on MRM-1 (on the nadir port of Zarya). Russia's cancellation of the Research Module thus came to be of less consequence for the ISS program as a whole.  Design and construction  The Experiment Airlock on the Rassvet module. The module was designed and built by S.P.

Upon unloading, the equipment was delivered to a prelaunch processing facility run by the Astrotech. Energia specialists and technicians continued their work on the processing of the Rassvet module at the facility, completing stand-alone electrical tests and leak tests of the module and the airlock. They also prepared the airlock and the radiative heat exchanger for installation onto Rassvet. The module was moved to NASA's Space Station Processing Facility on 2 April 2010. After completing the final touches, it was placed into the shuttle payload transporter on 5 April 2010. The payload canister containing the Rassvet Module arrived at LC-39A on 15 April 2010. Engineers at Launch Pad 39A preparing Space Shuttle Atlantis had noticed paint peeling from the MRM-1 module. Although the problem was declared to have no impact on the operation of Rassvet, it posed a potential threat of releasing debris on orbit.

Tanabe castle was command held of Hosokawa Tadaoki. Tadaoki father Hosokawa Fujitaka and his mother Numata Jak≈ç defended the castle walls against Ishida Mitsunari's western forces under Onoki Shigekatsu. It is said that, due to the respect they held for Hosokawa, the besieging army was somewhat slower and less effective than they might have been otherwise, and in the end the battle served to tie up these Western Army (anti-Tokugawa) contingents, preventing them from being present at Sekigahara.

Admissions It offers a range of courses, mostly A Levels. Many students participate in a range of extracurricular activities. It is situated to the west of Southampton Common next to the Bellemoor pub at the junction of Hill Lane and Bellemoor Road. Near to the south is King Edward VI School, Southampton. History Foundation Taunton's School was founded in 1760 by Richard Taunton, former Mayor of Southampton. In 1864 it moved to a specially built site on New Road. In 1875 it was established as an endowed school, to be called Taunton's Trade School. The school became a public secondary school and the name changed once more to Taunton's School. Grammar school In 1926, the school moved to a new campus on Highfield Road. It was officially opened by Eustace Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Newcastle (then the Coalition Conservative MP for Hastings) on 26 April 1927. It was administered by the City of Southampton Education Committee. In 1968 it had around 850 boys. Sixth form college In 1969, it was reorganised as a sixth form college for boys and renamed to Richard Taunton College. From 1978 girls were admitted. Hill College Meanwhile, in 1858, the Southampton College and High School for Girls was founded. In 1936 it moved to a site on Hill Lane. In 1967, it was reorganised as a sixth form college for girls and renamed to Southampton College for Girls. Boys were admitted from 1979, along with a name change to Hill College, reflecting the location of the college. Merger In 1989 the two colleges merged using the name Taunton's College although the Hill Lane site was refurbished and moved into in 1993. Redevelopment proposal 2007 A 2007 redevelopment proposal for Taunton's College, on Hill Lane in Southampton, which proposed replacement of nearly all the buildings on the site including the main building completed in 1937 as the Southampton Grammar School for Girls was formally cancelled by June 2009. Funds hoped for the redevelopment of many sixth form and Further Education colleges throughout England were revealed earlier in 2009 to be insufficient for a mooted major national programme of rebuilds. Taunton's proposal was one of many which in the outturn could not be funded. Name Change On 11 July 2012, Taunton's College changed its name to Richard Taunton Sixth Form College.

It was created to recognize French and allied soldiers who were cited for valorous service during World War I, similar to the British mentioned in dispatches but with multiple degrees equivalent to other nations' decorations for courage. Soon after the outbreak of World War I, French military officials felt that a new military award had to be created. At that time, the Citation du jour (\\"Daily Citation\\") already existed to acknowledge soldiers, but it was just a sheet of paper. Only the M√©daille Militaire and Legion of Honour were bestowed for courage in the field, due to the numbers now involved, a new decoration was required in earnest. At the end of 1914, General Bo√´lle, Commandant in Chief of the French 4th Army Corps, tried to convince the French administration to create a formal military award. Maurice Barr√®s, the noted writer and parliamentarian for Paris, gave Bo√´lle support in his efforts. On 23 December 1914, the French parliamentarian Georges Bonnefous proposed a legislative bill to create the Croix de la Valeur Militaire (\\"Cross of Military Valour\\") signed by 66 other parliamentarians. √âmile Driant, a parliamentarian who served in the war zone during much of this time, became its natural spokesman when he returned to the legislature. On 18 January 1915, Driant submitted this bill but the name of the military award was renamed to Croix de guerre (\\"War Cross\\"). After parliamentary discussions, the bill was adopted on 2 April 1915. World War I began in 1914 and ended in 1918, so the final name adopted is \\"Croix de guerre 1914‚Äì1918\\".  Award statute  Every Croix de guerre awarded carries at least one citation for gallantry or courage to a member of any rank of the French military or of an allied army. Ribbon devices indicate the importance or degree of the soldier's role during the action cited. The lowest degree is represented by a bronze star and the highest degree is represented by a bronze palm. The cross is only awarded once and subsequent actions worthy of citations will be limited to additional ribbon devices on the originally received insignia. The number of ribbon devices on a Croix de guerre is not limited, some awards, especially to ace fighter pilots, had extremely long ribbons with dozens of stars and palms. The Croix de guerre 1914-1918 was attributed to: *French and allied soldiers individually cited for a wartime act of gallantry; *Civilians and militarized personnel individually cited for a wartime act of gallantry; *Automatically to soldiers and civilians not specifically cited for a Croix de guerre but awarded the L√©gion d'honneur or M√©daille militaire for the highest acts of wartime valour and gazetted in the Official Journal of the French Republic; *Collectively, to army units, ships or air squadrons; *To cities and villages, martyrs of war, destroyed, ravaged or bombed by the enemy (2952 towns received the Croix de guerre 1914‚Äì1918, in this case, always awarded with palm). Soldiers who were/are members of units recognized by a collective unit award of the Croix de guerre may wear the Fourrag√®re of the Croix de guerre 1914-1918 as long as they remain members of that unit. Soldiers who actively took part as members of units during repeated feats of arms recognized by more than one collective award of the Croix de guerre may continue to wear the fourrag√®re even after leaving the meritorious unit. Battle streamers in the colours of the Croix de guerre 1914-1918 are affixed to the colours of recipient units.  Award description  The cross was designed by the sculptor Paul-Albert Bartholom√©. It is 37 mm wide, Florentine bronze cross patt√©e, with two crossed swords pointing up between the arms. The obverse centre medallion bears the relief image of the French Republic in the form of the bust of a young woman wearing a Phrygian cap surrounded by the circular relief inscription R√âPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE (FRENCH REPUBLIC). Not knowing how long the war would last, the reverse centre medallion bears the dates 1914‚Äì1915, 1914‚Äì1916, 1914‚Äì1917 and finally 1914‚Äì1918. The cross is suspended by a ring through a suspension loop cast atop the upper cross arm. It hangs from a 37 mm wide green silk moir√© ribbon with seven narrow 1,5 mm wide vertical red stripes evenly spaced and two 1 mm red edge stripes. left The lowest degree is represented by a bronze star and the highest degree is represented by a silver palm. The cross was worn with the appropriate attachments to signify the singular or multiple awards of the decoration. * Bronze star (√©toile de bronze): for those who were mentioned at the regiment or brigade level.. * Silver star (√©toile d'argent): for those who were cited at the division level. * Silver gilt star (√©toile vermeil): for those who were cited at the corps level. * Bronze palm (palme de bronze): for those who were cited at the army level. * Silver palm (palme d'argent): could be worn in lieu of five bronze palms.

It was used in some of the earliest photo-electric detectors by T. Case who developed the so-called thalofide (sometimes spelt thallofide) cell, used in early film projectors. Case described the detector material as consisting of thallium, oxygen and sulfur, and this was incorrectly described by others as being thallium oxysulfide, which incidentally is a compound that is not known. Case's work was then built on by R.J. Cashman who recognised that the controlled oxidation of the Tl2S film was key to the operation of the cell. Cashman's work culminated in the development of long wave infrared detectors used during the Second World War.American patent 2448517, filed 1944, granted 1948 Reliable Tl2S detectors were also developed in Germany at the same time. Tl2S is found in nature as the mineral carlinite which has the distinction of being the only sulfide mineral of thallium that does not contain at least two metals. Tl2S has a distorted anti-CdI2 structure. Tl2S can be prepared from the elements or by precipitating the sulfide from a solution of thallium(I), e.g. the sulfate or nitrate. Thin films have been deposited, produced from a mixture of citratothallium complex and thiourea.

First compiled in the 17th century, it is the pioneering work of all written sources for Min languages, and is widely quoted in modern academic research in Chinese phonology.  Composition  The Qi Lin Bayin is a combination of two dictionaries: * Qƒ´ cƒÅnj≈´n bƒÅyƒ´n z√¨y√¨ bi√†nl«én ÊàöÂèÉËªçÂÖ´Èü≥Â≠óÁæ©‰æøË¶Ω \\"Eight Sounds of General Qi and a Convenient Prospectus of Word Meaning\\", and * T√†ish«ê L√≠n B√¨shƒÅn xiƒÅnshƒìng zh≈´y√π t√≥ngshƒìng Â§™Âè≤ÊûóÁ¢ßÂ±±ÂÖàÁîüÁè†ÁéâÂêåËÅ≤ \\"Homonyms of Pearl and Jade by the Honorable Lin Bishan\\". The combined edition was published in 1749 by Jin An, a citizen of Fuzhou, who added a foreword. As local works, the earlier dictionaries were largely ignored by the scholarly tradition, so inferences about their date and authorship are necessarily based on internal evidence. The Qƒ´ is named in honour of Qi Jiguang, a general who led a mission to evict pirates from Fujian between 1562 and 1567, and presumably dates from the late 16th century. However, it is unlikely that Qi himself was the author, as he was a native of Shandong and spent only a few years in the area, and the book is not mentioned in his official biography. Luo Changpei and other scholars have suggested that the book was written or compiled by the scholar Chen Di, who served in Qi's army, and later made major contributions to Chinese philology. However, there are numerous differences between the Qƒ´ and Chen's known works. Most modern authors believe the book to be the work of one C√†i Sh√¨p√†n (), who is credited in the dictionary with \\"collecting and editing\\" the work, but is otherwise unknown. The L√≠n appears to be patterned on the structure of the Qƒ´. It is named in honour of L√≠n B√¨shƒÅn (), a native of Minhou County who served as an official in Hebei shortly after passing the advanced examination in 1688. Although the book is believed to date from the end of the 17th century, Lin is not known to have produced any scholarly works. As with the Qƒ´, the L√≠n is attributed by most modern scholars to an otherwise-unknown person recorded as having edited it, Ch√©n TƒÅ (). Tones, initials, and rimes Tones The tonal categories of Fuzhou dialect have remained stable since the time of Qƒ´ L√≠n BƒÅyƒ´n. In the book title, BƒÅyƒ´n (lit. eight sounds) denotes eight tones, whose names are: (1) ‰∏äÂπ≥, (2) ‰∏ä‰∏ä, (3) ‰∏äÂéª, (4) ‰∏äÂÖ•, (5) ‰∏ãÂπ≥, (6) ‰∏ã‰∏ä, (7) ‰∏ãÂéª, and (8) ‰∏ãÂÖ•. But the sixth tone ‰∏ã‰∏ä is actually identical with the second one ‰∏ä‰∏ä and therefore exists in theory only. In other words, Fuzhou dialect has seven rather than eight tones, and the term BƒÅyƒ´n is something of a misnomer. However, due to the lack of phonetic descriptions of the seven tones, the deduction of the tonal values of that time is considered beyond possibility. Initials In Qƒ´ L√≠n BƒÅyƒ´n, the fifteen initials are organized into a five-character shƒ´ (the last five characters \\"ÊâìÊéåËàáÂêõÁü•\\" are simply used to make up the four lines as a whole), as follows: :{ -  Êü≥ÈÇäÊ±ÇÊ∞£‰Ωé,  , , , , -  Ê≥¢‰ªñÊõæÊó•ÊôÇ,  , , , , -  È∂ØËíôË™ûÂá∫Èùû,  null initial, , , , -  ÊâìÊéåËàáÂêõÁü•. } In spite of the perceptible confluence of and in modern Fuzhou dialect, the initial structure nowadays is by and large the same as it was in the time of Qƒ´ L√≠n BƒÅyƒ´n. Rimes Likewise, a c√≠ is built up in Qƒ´ L√≠n BƒÅyƒ´n by all thirty- three rimes in the then Fuzhou dialect (three characters, \\"Èáë\\", \\"Ê¢Ö\\" and \\"ÈÅÆ\\", are redundant), as follows: :{ -  Êò•Ëä±È¶ô,  , , -  ÁßãÂ±±Èñã,  , , -  ÂòâË≥ìÊ≠°Ê≠åÈ†àÈáëÊùØ.  , , , , , redundant, -  Â≠§ÁáàÂÖâËºùÁáíÈäÄÁº∏.  , , , , , , -  ‰πãÊù±ÈÉä,  , , -  ÈÅéË•øÊ©ã.  , , -  ÈõûËÅ≤ÂÇ¨ÂàùÂ§©,  , , , , -  Â•áÊ¢ÖÊ≠™ÈÅÆÊ∫ù.  , redundant, , redundant, } The past couple of centuries witnessed three major changes in Fuzhou dialect. The first is the phenomenon of close/open rimes, by which the ‰∏äÂéª, ‰∏äÂÖ• and ‰∏ãÂéª characters shift its rime to its open form under certain circumstances; the second is the merger of and , as well as and ; and the last is the confusion of the codas and . Role in early studies of Fuzhou dialect For centuries, the Qi Lin Bayin had been used by local people as an authoritative reference on the Fuzhou pronunciation. It also greatly assisted the earliest Western missionaries in Fuzhou in learning and studying the native language. The American Methodist missionary M.C. White published the first Western description of the Fuzhou dialect. White based his account of the phonology directly on the Qi Lin Bayin, writing: To obtain a more convenient system than the Chinese characters naming the initials and finals, White spelled out each of them using the Latin-based alphabet devised by the English philologist Sir William Jones to represent languages of India, the Pacific and North America. He thus produced the first published romanization of the language. The scheme consists of fourteen consonants (the null initial is not written) and nine vowels: *Consonants: ch, ch', h, k, k', l, m, n, ng, p, p', s, t, t' *Vowels: a, e, √®, √´, i, o, √≤, u, √º White's romanization was adjusted by later authors, and became standardized as Foochow Romanized (B√†ng- u√¢-c√™) several decades later.

Company The theatre is also the base for the Norwich Puppet Theatre Company, which creates and presents its own productions, touring to schools and venues throughout the UK as well as international venues and festivals. Following a period of hiatus due to the loss of artistic director in 2008, the company returned in 2010 with a new production in collaboration with the Indefinite Articles theatre company, entitled The Chalk Giants. The company's work is informed by concepts and techniques from a range of cultures, and encourages the exchange of ideas by hosting companies and individuals of differing nationalities and by presenting its own work abroad. This has included performances in Canada, Finland, Spain, Mexico, and Slovenia. Artistic policy The theatre aims to develop a public taste for the artform of puppet theatre rather than follow a fashion or present shows purely for commercial reasons, maintaining a dialogue with, and breaking down barriers between, different artforms particularly in relation to the combination of puppet theatre and live music. The theatre works with a wide range of techniques including rod, glove, shadow, objects, toys and masks, developing and exploring each technique individually and in combination with one another.

Surrounding structures such as the tensor fasciae latae and the greater trochanter may also be affected. The injury results from the crushing of soft tissue between a hard object and the iliac crest. Contact sports are a common cause of this type of injury, most often in football and hockey in general due to improper equipment and placement. The direct impact can cause an avulsion fracture where a portion of bone is removed by a muscle. The pain is due to the cluneal nerve that runs right along the iliac crest, which makes this a very debilitating injury. This pain can be felt when walking, laughing, coughing or even breathing deeply. A hip pointer bruise usually causes bleeding into the hip abductor muscles, which move legs sideways, away from the midline of the body. This bleeding into muscle tissue creates swelling and makes leg movement painful. The hematoma that occurs can potentially build on the femoral nerve or lateral cutaneous of the femur. This injury usually lasts from one to six weeks, depending on the damage. In most cases, patients recover completely. A full assessment should be undertaken to rule out the possibility of damage to abdominal organs. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include immediate pain, bruising and swelling, obvious weakness, spasms and a rapid decline in the hip / leg function, resulting in a decreased range of motion. Diagnosis Management Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (RICE) are standard treatments in the first 48 hours of an injury to the hip pointer. After 48 hours, patients can begin gently stretching, strengthening exercises, flexibility and coordination. For the first 7‚Äì10 days, patients can take anti- inflammatories such as ibuprofen and apply ice. Since this injury is very painful, recovery is usually very slow. When the person is without pain, sports massage and range-of-motion activities may reduce tension and swelling and prevent scar tissue buildup. Furthermore, an injection of corticosteroids into the affected area may reduce symptoms in the short term and accelerate rehabilitation. Operative treatment is rarely indicated and is reserved for patients suffering from significant displacement or fractures of the bones. To prevent hip pointer, the equipment must be adequate in the sport and be well positioned and good size. It should also maintain excellent flexibility, strength and endurance of the hip, pelvis and lower back muscles.

The promotion evolved out of the NWA-affiliated Southeastern Championship Wrestling and Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling territories owned by Fuller, who purchased the Knoxville territory from John Cazana in 1974 and the Alabama/Florida territory in 1977. When Fuller sold the promotion to David Woods in 1988, the name was changed to Continental Wrestling Federation. History The Gulf Coast Years (1954 - 1974) Nashville promoter Roy Welch had purchased the Mobile-Pensacola end of Leroy McGuirk's Tri-State Wrestling. Unlike McGuirk, who only promoted in the Mobile-Pensacola area on special occasions called spot shows, Welch decided to make promoting in Mobile-Pensacola a frequent attraction in the summer. However, due to his obligations in Nashville, his son Buddy Fuller (Edward Welch) was made booker for Mobile-Pensacola, and Fuller eventually expanded the territory into Mississippi-Louisiana as well. At this point, the territory didn't even have a name, its own belts, or even its own wrestlers (aside from members of The Welch Family of course). They often relied on wrestlers and champions from Buddy's and their Uncle Lester Welch's territory. He ran in places like Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia (which would eventually become Championship Wrestling from Florida and Georgia Championship Wrestling), as well getting help from his father in Nashville, Tennessee, and some occasional help from his Uncles Herb and Jack. These early attempts would start to unravel when Buddy Fuller failed to make payments to the territory from his father Roy Welch. Buddy's cousin Lee Fields (Albert Lee Hatfield) would save the territory and gave it the name \\"Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling\\". Lee Fields would eventually buy the territory from Roy Welch and Buddy Fuller, and run shows in the area for almost two decades with Rocky McGuire booking Dothan- Panama City and Bob Kelly booking Mobile-Pensacola and Mississippi after a falling out with promoters in Louisiana with Mobile-Pensacola only running in the summer months. Kelly turned the promotion around from holding monthly and seasonal shows in a few towns which only drew a few hundred people to holding weekly shows in a different town night after night with local television exposure in each market, which led to each arena drawing thousands. Bob Kelly left the wrestling business in 1976 to enter real estate and spend more time with family, and Lee Fields found it more difficult to operate both his wrestling promotion and Mobile International Speedway at the same time.. So he sold it to his cousin Ron Fuller around 1977-1978. The Southeastern Years (1974 - 1985) In 1974, Ron Fuller purchased Southeastern Championship Wrestling based in Knoxville, Tennessee from John Cazana, where he focused mainly on the east Tennessee area. In 1977, Ron Fuller took over the territory his grandfather and father had founded when GCCW folded and Fuller expanded the SECW to run in the Southern Alabama, Northern Florida area in addition the Eastern Tennessee territory he already established. This was initially labelled ‚Äùthe Southern Division‚Äù of the SECW treating them as two separate entities despite the original plan to run a talent exchange between the two involving talent spending sixteen months in one end of the territory and then spend eight months in another to regain momentum after losing steam in the previous one. In June 1979, several members of the talent roster and behind the scenes personnel left SECW out frustration involving backstage politics with Ron's brother Robert Fuller who was considered lazy in terms of booking the territory, and spent many nights partying and felt his spot in Southeastern was owed to him since he was a member of The Welch/Fuller family. Led by Bob Roop, Ronnie Garvin, Bob Orton Jr. and Boris Malenko, All-Star Championship Wrestling fought a six-month promotional war over the Knoxville territory. Many of these defectors later joined the Kentucky based outlaw promotion International Championship Wrestling owned and operated by Angelo Poffo. After this, the Knoxville end of Southeastern experienced financial losses, and sold to promotions such as Jim Crockett Promotions and Georgia Championship Wrestling for the next five years. Fuller then made Birmingham his main end of the territory with the Dothan end continuing to flourish, giving early exposure to future stars such as The Fabulous Freebirds, rising stars in the territory along the lines of Austin Idol, and appearances by Ric Flair who would defend the NWA World Heavyweight Title in the area each year. The Continental Years (1985 - 1989) Continental Championship Wrestling (1985‚Äì1988) Five years later, Fuller decided that it was time to reach beyond the Southern Alabama/Northern Florida area and re-purchased the Knoxville end of the territory, with this expansion came a name change to Continental Championship Wrestling. This was an attempt on Ron Fuller's part to compete with Vince McMahon. After a failed negotiation with CBS, he settled on moving the television show out of the small television studio and into the big arenas where they did house shows in order to give the promotion a national look and feel. While the name Southeastern restricted the promotion to a more regional feel, the name Continental gave fans the impression they toured all over the country, except Alaska and Hawaii. Continental Wrestling Federation (1988‚Äì1989) In 1988, WCOV-TV owner David Woods bought the controlling interest in the promotion from Ron Fuller, and he renamed it Continental Wrestling Federation in a further attempt to compete with Vince McMahon and appear to resemble a nationwide promotion, even to the point of getting an odd national TV deal with Financial News Network. Their last TV episode aired on November 25, 1989. The promotion closed after their final show on December 6, 1989. Legacy Despite many huge angles over the years, this territory often has the status as the lost promotion. Such obscurity was due to the lack of media coverage during the Gulf Coast and Southeastern years since both Lee Fields and Ron Fuller believed that their promotions should not be covered by wrestling magazines and often did not allow reporters in the locker room to interview the wrestlers. This was to prevent the exposure to kayfabe and preserve the illusion of wrestling as a sport in the area. However, Fuller relented with the changeover to Continental in order to get national exposure for the promotion from the magazines. Such exposure was at an all-time high during the Eddie Gilbert period. Due to the expensive nature of archiving at television stations before the home video boom of the 1980s, much of the footage from the Gulf Coast era and the Knoxville portion of Southeastern no longer exists, despite a few bits of rare footage turning up here and there. However, almost all of the Dothan portion of Southeastern along with the majority of Continental footage still exists. They are still owned by David Woods and Woods Communications.

The couple lived in Philadelphia for a year, and then returned to England, where they finally settled in Penkridge, Staffordshire, where she died in 1827.Isobel Grundy, \\"Lewis , Alethea (1749‚Äì1827)\\", ODNB, Oxford University Press, 2004 Retrieved 27 September 2014.

It is situated on the A172 road, north-east from Northallerton and south-east from the small market town of Stokesley. Overview Swainby is located at the north-western corner of the North York Moors National Park. The characteristics of the village and the surrounding area consist of traditional Yorkshire dry stone walls, hills, sheep, heather and moorland. The name of the village derives from Old Norse, Sveins and by which means the village next to the swans or the land of Svein's people. The village is close to the ruins of Whorlton Castle; Swainby appears to have been built after its abandonment, possibly due to the Black Death (or some other disease) leaving the inhabitants of the castle low in number in 1428. Holy Cross Church (Church of England) was designed by T. H. Wyatt; he was commissioned to do it by the Marquess of Ailesbury. It is in the Early English style and constructed of locally quarried stone. The grade II listed church was consecrated on 4 October 1877. In the 19th century the housing of miners who worked the nearby hills for ironstone and jet led to an expansion of the village. Scugdale Beck, a tributary of the River Leven, cuts northwards through the village with two roads either side of the water and houses built on both sides. Swainby contains two public houses, \\"The Blacksmiths Arms\\" and \\"The Black Horse\\", and a caravan park with farm house. Governance Although Swainby is in Whorlton civil parish it has retained an electoral ward in its own name. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,820. Transport Swainby was the site where an old drover's road entered the North York Moors. The road continued south to Sutton Bank where it fed into the prehistoric road that is now the A170. Cattle from Ryedale were brought up to Swainby to be sold in the village. The village is just south of the A172 road which connects the A19 road with Middlesbrough bypassing Stokesley. The village lies on the Northallerton to Stokesley bus route. A railway ran through the village between 1857 and 1899. It connected with railway station on the Picton‚ÄìBattersby line but it was not open to passenger traffic, being used to move ironstone from Whorlton to the smelters on Teesside only.

The SCID-II is a diagnostic exam used to determine Axis II disorders (personality disorders). There are at least 700 published studies in which the SCID was the diagnostic instrument used. Major parts of the SCID have been translated into other languages, including Danish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Zulu. An Axis I SCID assessment with a psychiatric patient usually takes between 1 and 2 hours, depending on the complexity of the subject's psychiatric history and their ability to clearly describe episodes of current and past symptoms. A SCID with a non-psychiatric patient takes 1/2 hour to 1-1/2 hours. (See editions below.) A SCID-II personality assessment takes about 1/2 to 1 hour. The instrument was designed to be administered by a mental health professional, for example a psychologist or psychiatrist. This must be someone who has relevant professional training and has had experience performing unstructured, open-ended question, diagnostic evaluations. However, for the purposes of some research studies, non-clinician research assistants, who have extensive experience with the study population in question, and who have demonstrated competence, have been trained to use the SCID. The less clinical experience and specific education the potential interviewer has had, the more training is required. DSM-5 editions of the SCID-5 The SCID-5 for DSM-5 has been published in 2016. The SCID-II has been replaced by the SCID-5-PD, the SCID-I by a clinical (SCID-5-CV) and research version (SKID-5-RV).

It was bred in second part of the nineteenth century, principally at the Prussian state stud at Schloss Wickrath in Wickrathberg, now part of M√∂nchengladbach in North Rhine-Westphalia. History The farmers of the Rhineland needed powerful horses to work the heavy loess soil of the area. In the nineteenth century various heavy horses were imported from neighbouring countries ‚Äì Belgium, Denmark, France and the Netherlands ‚Äì as were Clydesdale, Shire and Suffolk Punch animals from England; these led to little improvement of the local stock, partly because of acclimatisation problems, partly because of lack of a clear direction. In the 1870s the decision was taken at the Prussian state stud at Schloss Wickrath, at that time in the Rhine Province of the Kingdom of Prussia, to concentrate breeding on the Belgian type. The first Belgian stallions stood at Wickrath in 1876, and by 1880 there were fifty. A stud book was opened in 1892; there were 148 mares registered in that year. Numbers of the breed grew rapidly in the first half of the twentieth century, and by 1946 there were 26,990 registered mares. In some years 700 young stallions were presented for approval for breeding. The Second World War caused a drastic decline in the Rhenish German Coldblood. While there was a brief revival in agricultural use of horses in the post-War years, the progressive mechanisation of agriculture led to a further decline. The Wickrath stud was closed in 1957, and merged into the stud of Warendorf, in Westphalia. By 1975 there were eleven mares and two stallions registered in the stud book. Numbers have slowly recovered, and in 2013 were reported as 1173 mares and 149 stallions. The Rhenish German Coldblood was listed as \\"endangered\\" by the FAO in 2007; it is listed in Category III, \\"endangered\\" on the red list of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gef√§hrdeter Haustierrassen. Because of the political division of Germany in the aftermath of the Second World War, which lasted until the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, there was for more than fifty years no possibility of interbreeding between populations of the Rhenish German Coldblood in West Germany and those in the East. Three regional sub-populations of the breed developed in East Germany during this time: the Altm√§rkisches Kaltblut in the historical Altmark region, the Mecklenburger Kaltblut in the historical Mecklenburg region, and the S√§chsich-Th√ºringisches Kaltblut in Thuringia and the former province of Saxony. As a result of their long reproductive isolation, the Mecklenburger and S√§chsich-Th√ºringisches sub-populations, while genetically indistinguishable, are genetically distinct from the Rhenish German Coldblood of the western part of the country.

It won the 1991 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award. __TOC__ Introduction > Having arrived in Liverpool, I took a ship for the New World For hundreds of years this sentence has tantalized and inspired Europeans. Jonathan Raban follows in the footsteps of Hector St John de Crevecouer - Mister Heartbreak and author of Letters from an American Farmer 1782)- and several million emigrants to discover America and the immigrant experience afresh. He sails from Liverpool docks to New York City and travels on to Alabama, Seattle, and the Florida Keys. Wherever he goes, there is a new identity to discover and a new life to live.  Plot summary  In Hunting Mister Heartbreak, Raban sets off from the Port of Liverpool on board the 56,000 ton container ship Atlantic Conveyor, following in the footsteps of the first emigrants to America (\\"Having arrived in Liverpool, I took ship for the New World.\\") His meandering journey takes him to New York City, whose inhabitants he divides into the Street People - poor New Yorkers who have to face the daily threat of poverty and mugging - and the Air People - rich New Yorkers who rely on elevators to keep them off street level. He leaves New York in distaste and proceeds in his hired car down to the Deep South, choosing to lie up for a time as a temporary resident of Guntersville, Alabama, a town which he immediately takes a liking to on one of his stopovers. He decides to devote some time to meeting the residents and absorbing the local lifestyle in his rented lakeside cabin in the company of Gypsy, an old black lab bitch on loan to scare off the anonymous caller who keeps on making threatening calls in the middle of the night. He then makes his way up to Seattle and rents a room in the Josephinum Residence. From here, he makes forays into the city and comes across some of the Korean immigrants who have struggled to carve out a new life for themselves in America. The books ends with Raban's search for the end of America in the Florida Keys, \\"the Land of Cockaigne\\". To fully explore and familiarise himself with the character of the Keys, he hires Sea Mist, a 32-foot sloop:  References  Hunting Mister Heartbreak, Picador (1991) , External links * Time, 'Keeping A Weather Eye' * The Guardian, September 23, 2006, 'Rootless in Seattle, Aida Edemariam Category:1990 non-fiction books Category:American travel books ","title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak"},{"id":"10962366","text":"Charles Edward Church (January 3, 1835 - January 3, 1906) was a Canadian politician.

The Minister for Housing is responsible for the Office of Housing (formerly the Victorian Housing Commission); and is one of four state ministers responsible for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The Housing Commission of Victoria was established in 1938.THE RELUCTANT LANDLORDS? A History Of Public Housing In Australia, David Hayward Its stated purpose of improving existing housing and to provide adequate housing for people of limited means (public housing).Australian Science at Work Register, The University of Melbourne eScholarship Research Centre, AustehcWeb, 2000‚Äì2007 The Commission ceased to exist in 1984, as it became the Office of Housing. Housing Commission remains the common colloquial term for public housing estates and developments in Victoria, particularly the inner city tower estates built in the late 1950s and 1960s by Liberal State Governments. The Housing Commission towers were planned as a major capital work solution to urban ghettoisation. These 20 storey towers loom over many of the inner suburbs in Melbourne, and are usually built in 2‚Äì6 tower configurations. Many blocks of occupied terrace and worker cottage style housing were cleared and towers of 10 apartments a floor built, surrounded by gardens and car parks. The future high property value of the former types of housing and the gentrification of inner urban areas was not foreseen. Opponents of these projects claimed that the towers were merely turning the slums upright. One of the more vocal anti-tower campaigners in the 1960s, Barry Pullen, later became a Minister for Housing in the Cain Labor Government. Crime and substance abuse problems on the estates have indeed fluctuated to high levels over the years, as different governments apply policies to renew the residential environments. The Victorian Minister for Housing was at the centre of the Victorian land scandals of 1973‚Äì82.Wayward governance ‚Äì illegality and its control in the public sector, P N Grabosky, Australian Institute of Criminology, Canberra, 1989.

It was bred in the early twentieth century in farms and collectives in Ivanovo Oblast and Vladimir Oblast, to the east of Moscow. The most important influence on the development of the breed was from three Clydesdale stallions foaled between 1910 and 1923. The Vladimir was officially recognised in 1946.  History  The Russian Empire had no indigenous breeds of heavy draught horse. The Vladimir was created at about the same time as the development of the Russian Heavy Draught in Ukraine. The foundations of the Vladimir breed were laid between 1886 and 1924. Initial breeding began at the stud farm of Gavrilov Posad, in Ivanovo Oblast, where local horses were cross-bred with imported Clydesdale stock, with some limited influence from Cleveland Bay, Percheron and Suffolk Punch. Some use was made of Shire mares between 1919 and 1929. The three foundation stallions of the breed were all Clydesdales. Two of these ‚Äì Border Brand and Lord James ‚Äì were foaled in 1910, while Glen Albin was born in 1923. The amount of cross-breeding was progressively reduced during the 1920s, and over the next twenty years the character and type of the breed were fixed. Official recognition came in 1946.  Characteristics  The Vladimir is a draught horse of medium power, with energetic and active gaits. It is more solidly built than the Clydesdale, and unusually deep in the girth ‚Äì thoracic circumference may reach It is usually clean-legged, though feathering can occur. Bay is the most usual colour, with white markings to the face and legs.  Use  The Vladimir was bred for agricultural draught work. It may be reared for meat. It is fast-growing: at six months, foals may reach a weight of Because of its lively movement, it is found suitable for pulling the three-horse troika of the region.

BOPE has generated notoriety due to their role in the violent drug war in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and they have been referred to as a \\"Death Squad\\" by multiple newspapers.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/world/americas/14tropa.html One aspect that has been pointed out specifically is their logo, which bears a knife in a skull over crossed pistols (popularly known in Brazil as \\"faca na caveira\\", Portuguese for \\"knife in the skull\\"). According to the official BOPE website, the knife in the skull symbolizes \\"victory over death\\" and the crossed pistols are the symbol of the military police. A 2005 report on extra judicial executions by the New York University School of Law indicated that BOPE was involved in the deaths of 4 teenagers under the pretext that they were drug traffickers who were resisting arrest: \\"BOPE officers falsified the crime scene in order to incriminate the victims.

Written by sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two BOPE officers, Major Andr√© Batista and Captain Rodrigo Pimentel, it provides a semi-fictional account of the daily routine of BOPE as well as some historical events, based on the experiences of the latter two. It describes BOPE as a \\"killing machine\\" and details an alleged aborted assassination attempt by some police officers on then-governor Leonel Brizola. The book was controversial at the time of release, and reportedly resulted in Batista being reprimanded and censored by the Military Police. The book has been made into a movie, Tropa de Elite (Elite Squad), directed by Jos√© Padilha (the director of Bus 174), with a screenplay by Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Br√°ulio Mantovani. In 2010 the movie gained a sequel, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within. Two BOPE operators make an appearance in \\"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\\" as playable operators. These operators are Capit√£o (Captain) and Caveira (Skull). OPES is a Brazilian special police unit in the online first-person shooter CrossFire. The OPES logo features a skull and a knife similar to that of the BOPE. The OPES were introduced with the release of the 2011 Brazilian release of the game. BOPE is featured on Season 1, Episode 2 of Elite World Cops, a television show hosted by former SAS soldier and author Chris Ryan.

In September 2005, Kathryn Thomas (seconded from Gosforth High School) became the schools Acting Headteacher, replacing Paul Hugall. David Sheppard (also seconded from Gosforth High School) became Assistant Headteacher. In September 2006, Gosforth High took over the administration duties of Gosforth West Middle School, in a Federation style agreement. The federation came into action on 1 January 2007. Gosforth West was also renamed as Gosforth Junior High School after the Easter break. The uniform was set to change in September 2007, this included the removal of the tie from the uniform. The PRAISE Code which was introduced at the High School is also in practice at the Junior High School.

A new building is currently being developed. Gosforth Junior High had concrete tennis courts, until in around 2003 the area of land on which it was situated, was used for an additional building for Archibald First School. On 6 June 2007, David Bellamy opened the school's re-built wildlife garden, in one of the buildings' quadrangles, which has had contributions from local organisations, such as Northern Rock, The Gosforth Round Table and the school's pupils.

Track  Tram passing underneath the Vinschgauer Tor (c. 1925) The line started at the then-new Vinschger Bahn station, it went on to Mazzini Square and Theatre Square, where there was a junction with the Lana-Merano railway. After crossing the Post Bridge the line inclined sharply, and after eight kilometres it terminated at the Fountain Square in the Obermais quarter. The Tram Depot was at the rear of the cemetery, and is used today by the city's bus company.  Abandonment  The profit of the company wasn‚Äôt very high during the years the tram line operated. So after some time some of the cars where sold to the Bolzano Tramway company. In the '50s, like many other railway lines in the region, the tram was substituted by a bus line. Apart from the garage behind the cemetery, all traces of the line have been erased. In political campaigns by local politicians there has been sometimes talk of reactivating the tram to reduce air pollution in the town, which today has a lot of traffic.

It was partially destroyed by a fire, treated as arson, in July 2020 Commercial activity ceased at the mill in 1974, when the last Miller (Gerald Maurice Arthur \\"Moss\\" Turner) liquidated his civil engineering businesses (G.M.A. Turner & Son Ltd) which operated out of the mill and its grounds. The mill at the time belonged to a local landowner as part of his estate. The neighbouring site was owned by a chemical pesticide company known as \\"Pest Control\\" for many years. The plant closed in 2004 and the site was sold for a development to be named Hauxton Meadows. Because of government legislation, Fisons Agrochem, the previous owners of the development site, were obliged to buy out the neighbouring properties with residential housing. This included the mill site because of the newer Hauxton Mill House (approx 1922), which was part of the office complex for the plant, and Mill Cottage (rebuilt 1973). At first, Fisons rented the mill from the landowner, and used the mill itself for storage. Planning permission to convert the building to various uses was always rejected due to the historic interest. Mill House was converted to flats, and after another round of legal changes was finally used as an administrative office before falling into disuse in the mid eighties. The mill was left unattended, with the doors and windows blocked and barred, and gradually fell into a state of disrepair. A grate in front of the mill wheel was removed for now forgotten reasons, and a storm sent a tree crashing into the wooden wheel, effectively ending the operability of the mill around 1980. The grating has since been replaced and the remains of the tree removed. In 2018, o2h group acquired Hauxton Mill, and developed the site into Mill SciTech Park.

Biography  Margarita Azurdia studied at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas, and at McGill University of Liberal Arts-College Margarita Burgeois, of San Francisco, California. Azurdia's work reflects her feminist and anti-establishment views. In the 1960s, Azurdia publicly opposed neofigurativism (neofigurativismo), an art movement promoted by a group of male artists known as Grupo Vertebra, and was responsible for starting a new art movement known as new conceptual abstraction (nuevo abstraccionismo conceptual) In 1962 Azurdia exhibited her first painting, a self-portrait. Between 1971 and 1974, Azurdia created a series of fifty wood figurative sculptures, titled \\"Tribute to Guatemala\\" (Homenaje a Guatemala), that combine the sacramental with the profane. The sculptures were carved by local artisans to her specifications, and incorporated ornamental figures‚Äîplaster skulls, masks, feathers, pedestal tables‚Äîthat Azurdia collected from local artisans' stalls. The sculptures depict women carrying firearms, babies riding on crocodiles, and tigers transporting bananas, images reminiscent of the magic realism from Latin American literature After spending eight years in Paris where she focused on her poetry and painting, Azurdia returned to Guatemala in 1982, where she defended animal rights, gave workshops on the origins of sacred dance, and continued to write poetry. In 1982, she was a founder of the group Laboratory of Creativity (Laboratorio de Creatividad) that experimented with performance art in public spaces, theater cafes, art galleries, and museums. Through this group, Azurdia explored the notions of ritual in everyday life, space, and time through the medium of dance. She also presented her work in collective and individual shows in Mexico, the United States, France, and Central America. Some of her work is included in the permanent collection of the National Museum of Modern Art, Guatemala. Azurdia also participated in the biennials of S√£o Paulo and Medellin. After her death in 1998, her home in Guatemala City (located at 16-39 5th Avenue, zone 10) became a museum, the Museo Margarita Azurdia, where many of her paintings, sculptures, and photographs are displayed. In 2016 the Nuevo Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo (NuMu), the only contemporary art museum in Guatemala, created an exhibit of scaled-down reproductions of two of Azurdia's \\"Geometric Abstractions\\" paintings.

He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian award, in 2012.  Early life and education  A Maharashtrian Deshastha Madhwa Brahmin, he was born in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, and was educated in Tiruchirapalli and Madras (now Chennai), graduating with a BSc (Hons.) in Chemistry from Loyola College in 1958. After a short time as a lecturer in Jamal Mohamed College, Tiruchirapalli, he joined the Indian Administrative Service on 16 May 1960, and was allotted to the Gujarat Cadre.  Career  Vittal was part of the Indian Administrative Service's 1960 intake. In his career of more than 35 years, he has held a number of positions at the State Government and Central Government level, primarily in the fields of industrial administration, science and technology, and security, as well posts within public-private sector joint enterprises. He worked as Development Commissioner tasked with reviving the Port of Kandla Special Economic Zone, for the Department of Commerce for the Government of India. For the Gujarat State government he served as Industries Commissioner, in which post he was responsible for Gujarat becoming the first state in the country to be fully covered with District Industries Centres; setting up the single window service for industry promotion bureau (IndexTB) which was adopted later by other states; and setting up the Entrepreneurship Development Centre. He later served as Food and Civil Supplies Secretary, setting up the Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation; Chairman of the Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation; and Health and Family Welfare Secretary. He then served as Managing Director of Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers Company (GNFC), overseeing its emergence not only as an efficient business enterprise but also as a model for what a public sector body can do to spur development in poor areas. GNFC was a zero pollution plant. before returning to the Gujarat State government to serve as Additional Chief Secretary (Home), where he initiated proposals for setting up the Gujarat Police Housing Corporation. From there he switched to positions working for the Government of India, serving as Additional Secretary at the Department of Atomic Energy, then Secretary at the Department of Electronics, where he initiated policies for boosting software, setting up software technology parks and strategic alliances with the industry. He made the Department of Electronics a frontrunner in adjusting to the new industry- friendly policy, encouraging Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from IBM, Motorola and others, and expanding the technology park scheme for electronic hardware, creating special economic zones around India. He then became Chairman of the Telecoms Commission, where he initiated the process of liberalisation in the telecom sector and played a key role in delivering the National Telecom Policy of 1994, and Secretary at the Department of Telecommunications. He followed this with a stint as Chairman of the Public Enterprises Selection Board, where he initiated measures for greater transparency and speed in the functioning of the PESB, and also headed the Committee on Guidelines for the Public Sector (1997), under the auspices of the Ministry of Industry, Department of Public Enterprises, which resulted in the cancellation of 696 obsolete guidelines hampering the autonomy of the PSEs. His final post was Central Vigilance Commissioner. Over the course of his career he has also been the Chairman of many committees, expert groups and task forces, including: * Expert Group on IT in Government, Department of Personnel, Government of India * Task Force on Technology Exports, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India * Task Force on Telecom and Information Technology, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry * Expert Committee on Tamil Nadu Institute of Information Technology, Government of Tamil Nadu.

Such a quadratic form can, given a suitable choice of basis , be applied to a vector , giving : q(x) = \\\\left(x_1^2 + \\\\ldots + x_k^2\\\\right) - \\\\left(x_{k+1}^2 + \\\\ldots + x_n^2\\\\right) which is called the scalar square of the vector . For Euclidean spaces, , implying that the quadratic form is positive- definite.Euclidean spaces are regarded as pseudo-Euclidean spaces ‚Äì see for example . When , is an isotropic quadratic form. Note that if and , then , so that is a null vector. In a pseudo-Euclidean space with , unlike in a Euclidean space, there exist vectors with negative scalar square. As with the term Euclidean space, the term pseudo-Euclidean space may be used to refer to an affine space or a vector space depending on the author, with the latter alternatively being referred to as a pseudo-Euclidean vector space (see point‚Äìvector distinction).  Geometry  The geometry of a pseudo-Euclidean space is consistent despite some properties of Euclidean space not applying, most notably that it is not a metric space as explained below. The affine structure is unchanged, and thus also the concepts line, plane and, generally, of an affine subspace (flat), as well as line segments. Positive, zero, and negative scalar squares sign of A null vector is a vector for which the quadratic form is zero. Unlike in a Euclidean space, such a vector can be non- zero, in which case it is self-orthogonal. If the quadratic form is indefinite, a pseudo-Euclidean space has a linear cone of null vectors given by }. When the pseudo-Euclidean space provides a model for spacetime (see below), the null cone is called the light cone of the origin. The null cone separates two open sets,The standard topology on is assumed. respectively for which and . If , then the set of vectors for which is connected. If , then it consists of two disjoint parts, one with and another with . Similar statements can be made for vectors for which if is replaced with . Interval The quadratic form corresponds to the square of a vector in the Euclidean case. To define the vector norm (and distance) in an invariant manner, one has to get square roots of scalar squares, which leads to possibly imaginary distances; see square root of negative numbers. But even for a triangle with positive scalar squares of all three sides (whose square roots are real and positive), the triangle inequality does not hold in general. Hence terms norm and distance are avoided in pseudo-Euclidean geometry, which may be replaced with scalar square and interval respectively. Though, for a curve whose tangent vectors all have scalar squares of the same sign, the arc length is defined. It has important applications: see proper time, for example. Rotations and spheres right The rotations group of such space is indefinite orthogonal group , also denoted as without a reference to particular quadratic form.What is the \\"rotations group\\" depends on exact definition of a rotation. \\"O\\" groups contain improper rotations. Transforms that preserve orientation form the group , or , but it also is not connected if both and are positive. The group , which preserves orientation on positive and negative scalar square parts separately, is a (connected) analog of Euclidean rotations group . Indeed, all these groups are Lie groups of dimension . Such \\"rotations\\" preserve the form and, hence, the scalar square of each vector including whether it is positive, zero, or negative. Whereas Euclidean space has a unit sphere, pseudo-Euclidean space has the hypersurfaces } and }. Such a hypersurface, called a quasi- sphere, is preserved by the appropriate indefinite orthogonal group. Symmetric bilinear form The quadratic form gives rise to a symmetric bilinear form defined as follows: : \\\\langle x, y\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{2}[q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y)] = \\\\left(x_1 y_1 + \\\\ldots + x_k y_k\\\\right) - \\\\left(x_{k+1}y_{k+1} + \\\\ldots + x_n y_n\\\\right). The quadratic form can be expressed in terms of the bilinear form: . When , then and are orthogonal vectors of the pseudo-Euclidean space. This bilinear form is often referred to as the scalar product, and sometimes as \\"inner product\\" or \\"dot product\\", but it does not define an inner product space and it does not have the properties of the dot product of Euclidean vectors. If and are orthogonal and , then is hyperbolic-orthogonal to . The standard basis of the real -space is orthogonal. There are no orthonormal bases in a pseudo-Euclidean space for which the bilinear form is indefinite, because it cannot be used to define a vector norm. Subspaces and orthogonality For a (positive-dimensional) subspaceA linear subspace is assumed, but same conclusions are true for an affine flat with the only complication that the quadratic form is always defined on vectors, not points. of a pseudo-Euclidean space, when the quadratic form is restricted to , following three cases are possible: # is either positive or negative definite. Then, is essentially Euclidean (up to the sign of ). # is indefinite, but non-degenerate. Then, is itself pseudo- Euclidean. It is possible only if ; if , which means than is a plane, then it is called a hyperbolic plane. # is degenerate. One of most jarring properties (for a Euclidean intuition) of pseudo-Euclidean vectors and flats is their orthogonality. When two non-zero Euclidean vectors are orthogonal, they are not collinear. The intersections of any Euclidean linear subspace with its orthogonal complement is the {0}}} subspace. But the definition from the previous subsection immediately implies that any vector of zero scalar square is orthogonal to itself. Hence, the isotropic line generated by a null vector ŒΩ is a subset of its orthogonal complement . The formal definition of the orthogonal complement of a vector subspace in a pseudo-Euclidean space gives a perfectly well-defined result, which satisfies the equality due to the quadratic form's non-degeneracy. It is just the condition : } or, equivalently, all space, which can be broken if the subspace contains a null direction.Actually, is not zero only if the quadratic form restricted to is degenerate. While subspaces form a lattice, as in any vector space, this operation is not an orthocomplementation, in contrast to inner product spaces. For a subspace composed entirely of null vectors (which means that the scalar square , restricted to , equals to ), always holds: : or, equivalently, . Such a subspace can have up to dimensions.Thomas E. Cecil (1992) Lie Sphere Geometry, page 24, Universitext Springer For a (positive) Euclidean -subspace its orthogonal complement is a -dimensional negative \\"Euclidean\\" subspace, and vice versa. Generally, for a -dimensional subspace consisting of positive and negative dimensions (see Sylvester's law of inertia for clarification), its orthogonal \\"complement\\" has positive and negative dimensions, while the rest ones are degenerate and form the intersection. Parallelogram law and Pythagorean theorem The parallelogram law takes the form :q(x) + q(y) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(q(x + y) + q(x - y)). Using the square of the sum identity, for an arbitrary triangle one can express the scalar square of the third side from scalar squares of two sides and their bilinear form product: :q(x + y) = q(x) + q(y) + 2\\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle. This demonstrates that, for orthogonal vectors, a pseudo-Euclidean analog of the Pythagorean theorem holds: :\\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle = 0 \\\\Rightarrow q(x) + q(y) = q(x + y). Angle right Generally, absolute value of the bilinear form on two vectors may be greater than , equal to it, or less. This causes similar problems with definition of angle (see ) as appeared above for distances. If (only one positive term in ), then for vectors of positive scalar square: : \\\\langle x, y\\\\rangle \\\\ge \\\\sqrt{q(x)q(y)}\\\\,, which permits definition of the hyperbolic angle, an analog of angle between these vectors through inverse hyperbolic cosine: : \\\\operatorname{arccosh}\\\\frac{\\\\langle x, y\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{q(x)q(y)}}\\\\,. Note that , so for these can be understood as imaginary angles. It corresponds to the distance on a -dimensional hyperbolic space. This is known as rapidity in the context of theory of relativity discussed below. Unlike Euclidean angle, it takes values from and equals to 0 for antiparallel vectors. There is no reasonable definition of the angle between a null vector and another vector (either null or non-null).  Algebra and tensor calculus  Like Euclidean spaces, every pseudo-Euclidean vector space generates a Clifford algebra. Unlike properties above, where replacement of to changed numbers but not geometry, the sign reversal of the quadratic form results in a distinct Clifford algebra, so for example and are not isomorphic. Just like over any vector space, there are pseudo-Euclidean tensors. Like with a Euclidean structure, there are raising and lowering indices operators but, unlike the case with Euclidean tensors, there is no bases where these operations do not change values of components. If there is a vector , the corresponding covariant vector is: : v_\\\\alpha = q_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} v^\\\\beta\\\\,, and with the standard-form : q_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} I_{k\\\\times k} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -I_{(n-k)\\\\times(n-k)} \\\\end{pmatrix} the first components of are numerically the same as ones of , but the rest have opposite signs. The correspondence between contravariant and covariant tensors makes a tensor calculus on pseudo- Riemannian manifolds a generalization of one on Riemannian manifolds.  Examples  A very important pseudo-Euclidean space is Minkowski space, which is the mathematical setting in which Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity is formulated. For Minkowski space, and Another well-established representation uses and coordinate indices starting from (thence ), but they are equivalent up to sign of . See . so that : q(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - x_4^2, The geometry associated with this pseudo-metric was investigated by Poincar√©.H. Poincar√© (1906) On the Dynamics of the Electron, Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di PalermoB. A. Rosenfeld (1988) A History of Non-Euclidean Geometry, page 266, Studies in the history of mathematics and the physical sciences #12, Springer Its rotation group is the Lorentz group. The Poincar√© group includes also translations and plays the same role as Euclidean groups of ordinary Euclidean spaces. Another pseudo-Euclidean space is the plane consisting of split-complex numbers, equipped with the quadratic form : \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert = z z^* = z^* z = x^2 - y^2. This is the simplest case of an indefinite pseudo-Euclidean space (, ) and the only one where the null cone dissects the space to four open sets. The group consists of so named hyperbolic rotations.

The etymology of his name is uncertain, but may mean \\"God/He is my strength\\" or \\"God has helped me\\". Family The Hebrew Bible refers to Othniel as \\"Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb\\".Joshua 15:17, King James Version The expression is inconclusive in Hebrew, and has been taken to mean either that Othniel himself was the brother of Caleb, or that Othniel's father Kenaz was the brother of Caleb.See the notes to the New English Translation of the Bible The Talmud argues that Othniel was Caleb's brother. When Caleb promises the hand of his daughter Achsah to whoever conquers the land of Debir,Judges 1:1-2:5 it is Othniel who rises to the challenge, thus becoming Caleb's son- in-law.Joshua 15:16, 17; Judges 1:13 Campaign as a Judge The historical reality of events described in the Book of Judges is the subject of ongoing dispute among scholars, who vary in their opinions about how much of the book is historical. As to the story of Othniel in particular, biblical scholar Mark Zvi Brettler states, \\"The Ehud and Othniel stories contain clues that they are not meant to be read as depictions of the real past.\\" According to the biblical account, some time after the death of Joshua, the Israelites once again turned to sin and fell under the subjection of Chushan-rishathaim, the king of Aram-Naharaim in Mesopotamia, because of the transgressions against God. He oppressed them for eight years; when they \\"cried\\" unto God, Othniel was raised up to be their deliverer. He is the only Judge mentioned connected with the Tribe of Judah. Under Othniel, peace lasted for forty years. After these forty years, Israel fell under the subjection of Eglon, a king of Moab who defeated Israel with help from Ammon and Amalek (). Burial site A tomb traditionally regarded as belonging to Othniel Ben Knaz is located in Hebron in a traditional burial cave. Located approximately 200 meters west of the Beit Hadassah building, it has been revered as a site for prayers for generations. The structure of the tomb corresponds to the way Jewish burial sites were made in the times of the Mishnah, as a family burial cave with compartments in the sides. Menachem Mendel of Kamenitz, the first hotelier in the Land of Israel references his visit to the Tomb of Othniel in his 1839 book Sefer Korot Ha-Itim. He states, \\"outside of the city [of Hebron] I went to the grave of Othniel ben Kenaz and, next to him, are laid to rest 9 students this in niches in the wall of a shelter standing in a vineyard. I gave 20 pa‚Äôres to the owner of the vineyard.\\"The para was a unit of money used in the late Ottoman Empire. The author and traveler J. J. Benjamin mentioned visiting the tomb in his 1859 book Eight Years in Asia and Africa. He states, \\"Likewise outside the city, towards the south, in a vineyard, which was purchased by the Jews, are the graves of the father of King David and of the first Judge, Othniel, the son of Kinah.\\" In recent years prayer services have been organized for the holiday of Lag BaOmer and for Tisha B'Av.

The original moderator was Herald and Weekly Times journalist Frederick Howard.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/howard-frederick-james- fred-12658 (The HWT then owned both 3DB and HSV-7.) The radio version was somewhat short-lived but the television program lasted for some time. The Network Ten version of the program was hosted by former Network Ten news presenter Kathryn Robinson and aired on Sunday mornings at 10:30 am. It ran from October 1992. The program's first guest was the then prime minister, Paul Keating. As a Sunday morning talk show, usually the format included two guests ‚Äì a politician and a guest who may be a politician or industry expert. A panel of two journalists joined the presenter to question the guests on the week's political issues and news. Prior to 2013 the Parliament House bureau chief and political editor Paul Bongiorno shared the presenting role with Hugh Riminton on alternate weeks. From the show's beginning in 1992 until the end of 2011, the show and production was based at Sydney's Studios. In 2012, the studio production moved to the Networks Melbourne Studios ATV10 and with the change in format, production moved back to Sydney in the Fox Sports studio (owned by producer News Limited). David Johnston was the original host of the program until Paul Bongiorno replaced him in 1996.

Biography  Goldstein was born to a Jewish merchant family in Dortmund, Germany. At school, he experienced Germany's growing anti-Semitism and it had the effect of politicising him. In 1928, he joined the Young Communist League and two years later, the Communist Party of Germany, then headed by Ernst Th√§lmann. When the Nazis took power in 1933, Goldstein fled. He first lived in Luxembourg, working as a gardener, then moved to France. In 1935, he went to Palestine. A year later, the Spanish Civil War erupted and many German Communists volunteered to fight. Goldstein soon joined them. When the Second Spanish Republic collapsed in early 1939, Goldstein escaped across the border into France. As return to Germany was impossible, he was interned and held in Camp Vernet. Once France fell, his situation became perilous but it was three years before he was detected by the Vichy French authorities and deported to Germany. On arrival, he was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he worked in the coal pits for 30 months. Along with Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel (described in his book Night), Goldstein survived the death march from Auschwitz to Buchenwald. When Buchenwald was partly evacuated by the Nazis on 8 April 1945, Communist inmates stormed the watchtowers, killed the remaining guards and took control. The camp was formally liberated by American troops on 11 April 1945. Goldstein returned to East Germany after the war, working as a journalist, radio broadcaster and author. In 2001, Mr. Goldstein along with Peter Gingold, another Holocaust survivor, began a class action lawsuit in America suing the US government and the Bush family for a total of $40bn in compensation claim that both materially benefited from Auschwitz slave labor during the Second World War.

He also played in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He plays the small forward and shooting guard positions. Career Known as a scorer during his college days, Salvacion, who was a former NCAA Most Valuable Player has evolved into a solid defender and a clutch shooter that placed him in the regular rotation of the Barangay Ginebra Kings. Salvacion (which when translated in English means \\"salvation\\") is one of the best shooters the PBA has produced. Known to elevate his game during the playoffs, Salvacion's contribution was more evident during Ginebra's championship runs on the 2004‚Äì2005 and 2006‚Äì2007 Philippine Cup where he proved to be one of the key players. On September 12, 2014, he and Jason Ballesteros were sent to Blackwater Elite in a three-way trade involving NLEX Road Warriors and Meralco Bolts. NLEX obtained Blackwater's 2016 and 2017 2nd round pick along with the draft rights for Juneric Baloria. Meralco received Sean Anthony from NLEX via Blackwater as third party. In September 2015, Salvacion was signed by the Pacquiao Powervit Pilipinas Aguilas, which later became known as the Pilipinas MX3 Kings, of the ABL as one of the team's local players. However, in December 2015, Salvacion, along with Emmerson Oreta, Charles Mammie, Chad Alonzo, Jondan Salvador, and Adrian Celada were released by the Pilipinas MX3 Kings after a roster overhaul. Salvacion later became part of the Navotas Clutch of the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League as a playing assistant coach to Elvis Tolentino.

Hill-Trevor was the third son of Arthur Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire, and his wife Lady Maria (n√©e Windsor). He was elected to the House of Commons for County Down in 1845, a seat he held for the next 35 years.

By arrangement parts of the estates, including Brynkinalt in Wales, passed to Lord Edwin, who assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Trevor. In 1880 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Trevor, of Brynkinalt in the County of Denbigh. As Lord Edwin Hill-Trevor, Lord Trevor was a Captain in the North Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry, promoted Major in 1862, but retired from the regiment prior to its amalgamation into the unified Shropshire Yeomanry regiment in 1872.

A Beatle boot is a style of boot that has been worn since the 1960s‚Äîmade popular by the English rock group the Beatles, for whom they were originally made. The boots are a variant of the Chelsea boot: they are tight-fitting, Cuban-heeled, ankle-high boots with a sharp pointed toe. The style can feature either elastic or zipped sides. Beatle boots saw the reintroduction of high-heeled footwear for men.  History  The Beatles, seen here in 1963 Beatle boots are a direct descendant of the Chelsea boot, but have an even more pointed toe and a centre seam stitch running from ankle to toe, and the flamenco boot, from which its Cuban heel was derived. Beatle boots originated in October 1961, when English musicians John Lennon and Paul McCartney saw Chelsea boots whilst browsing in the London footwear company Anello & Davide, and consequently commissioned four pairs (with the addition of Cuban heels) for the Beatles, to complement their new suit image upon their return from Hamburg. Beatle boots were very popular with rock bands and artists during the middle 1960s but started to decline during the 1970s. The boots saw a surge of popularity during the punk movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s but again started to decline throughout the 1990s.

Based on real-life events that took place in the town of Aalst in 1999, the play recounts the murder of two children by their parents. It was originally performed in 2005 by the Ghent-based theatre company Victoria. Since then, it has toured extensively in Europe and in Canada. The background In January 1999, in the suburban Belgian town of Aalst, Luc de Winne and Maggie Strobbe checked into a hotel room with their two children, a boy aged seven and an infant girl of three months. They killed the daughter by suffocating her with a pillow, and the son by stabbing him with a pair of scissors. They were subsequently arrested, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. The case caused a sensation in Belgium and was the subject of massive coverage in the press and media. The play In 2005, Pol Heyvaert, a veteran stage designer who had a long-standing relationship with the Victoria theatre company, gave the story dramatic form. Heyvaert and his co-writer Dimitri Verhulst drew extensively on original source material, including statements and interviews given by the accused, television footage of the trial and a documentary on the murder investigation. Heyvaert also designed and directed the play, his first outing as a stage director. The format of the play is simple. Separated by a few feet, the couple sit on two chairs with a microphone stand in front of each. A white curtain hangs behind them. The stage is bare of any other furnishing. Over the next 70-odd minutes, the two are interrogated by a disembodied, authoritative voice, and the story of their lives and that of the murder of the children pours forth. It transpires that both parents had had horrific childhoods. The woman had been sexually abused by her father while the man had been raised in foster care and had become a petty criminal at an early age. They are both unemployed and live off generous state benefits, supplemented by income from moonlighting. Both exhibit a sense of entitlement and a lack of responsibility. They order consumer goods off catalogues, including three television sets and five stereos, but never pay for these items. Their domestic arrangements are wanting as well. Their house is filthy and constantly in the dark, with the bulbs painted black. Their relationship too is abusive and codependent. The murder of the children is described at length and in detail. The parents excuse their actions by saying that they did not want their children to be taken away by the state and put into foster care, and that they did not want them to suffer in life as they themselves had done. At the very end of the play, doubt is thrown over the veracity of their testimony. With its difficult subject-matter and frequently graphic detail, Aalst has been described as a 'disturbing' and 'complex' play, one that raises hard questions about individual morality and the welfare society. The play has been produced in theatres and festivals across Europe. The Scottish writer Duncan McLean has also adapted Aalst into a Scottish version. In March 2007, this version made its UK debut at the Tramway theatre in Glasgow as a joint production of Victoria and the National Theatre of Scotland. Kate Dickie and David McKay played the lead roles under Heyvaert's direction. The play then went on tour and made its London debut in April 2007 at the Soho Theatre.

It is attributed to Saint Clement of Ohrid, a disciple of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius. Archaeologists have come to believe that the church is located on the site where the first students of the Glagolitic alphabet (used to translate the Bible into Old Church Slavonic) were taught into the First Bulgarian Empire. History The original church is believed to have been built when Saint Clement arrived in Ohrid at the request of Boris I of Bulgaria and restored an old church. Sources say that Saint Clement was not satisfied with the size of the church and therefore built a new one over it and assigned Saint Panteleimon as its patron saint. Saint Clement Saint Clement used his newly created church as a liturgical building and a place for teaching his disciples his revision of the Glagolitic alphabet, known as the Cyrillic script. Clement personally built a crypt inside the church in which he was buried after his death in 916; his tomb still exists today. In the 15th century, Ottoman Turks converted the church into a mosque but during the beginning of the 16th century allowed ruined monasteries and churches to be restored, therefore, so was Saint Clement's church. The church was again ruined during the end of the 16th century or the beginning of the 17th century and another mosque, called Imaret Mosque (), was erected by the Ottomans. The Imaret Mosque was torn down in 2000 with the reason given that it was constructed over the remains of a church in the Plao≈°nik area and the former mosque was added to the damaged religious buildings list compiled by the Islamic Religious Community of Macedonia. Architecture View by night Many archaeologists believe that Clement himself designed and constructed the church. Clement, along with Naum of Preslav would use the church as a basis for teaching the Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets to Christianised Bulgarian Slavs, thus making it a university. The church stands on a hill which is now known as Plao≈°nik overlooking Lake Ohrid. Clement built his church on a restored church and a Roman basilica of five parts (the remains of the basilicas can still be seen outside the church). Judging by the architectural style and design of the church, researchers say that Saint Clement intended for his building to be a literary school for disciples, thus it is believed to be the first and oldest discontinued university in Europe. The exterior of the church contains a large number of finely detailed mosaics not far from a stone baptismal font used to baptise his disciples. Reconstruction and excavation Apart from the church's many reconstructions during the Ottoman Empire, it has recently undergone extensive reconstruction and excavation. Reconstruction started on December 8, 2000 and the physical church was fully reconstructed by August 10, 2002. Most of Saint Clement's relics were returned to the church. A partially ruined bell tower was restored on the right side of the church and the floors of the interior of the church have been reconstructed with marble. Reconstruction was carried out by hand using materials used to build the original church. Machines were only used to polish the interior during the reconstruction of the church. The first excavations of the church were carried out in 1943 by Prof. Dimche Koco. Excavations inside the church have revealed tunnels and crypts. Further excavations have been planned to uncover more remains under the church, including more ruins of the Roman basilicas that stood there (the pillars outside the church support the idea of more remains). On October 10, 2007, a collection of approximately 2,383 Venetian coins was discovered by archaeologists while excavating the church. A prominent archaeologist of North Macedonia, Pasko Kuzman, stated that the coins are of special significance because they indicate that Ohrid and Venice were commercially linked. Tradition As the church is one of the most sacred in North Macedonia, thousands of Macedonian Orthodox Christians gather at Plao≈°nik during large religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas to celebrate and take part in the liturgies.

LeMond offered a geometry based on the racing frames he used in competition, which had a longer top tube and wheelbase in an otherwise traditional lightweight steel frame. This was to stretch out the rider on the bicycle, with the intent of both lowering the frontal area presented to the wind, and optimizing power and stability. From 1995 until February 2010 Trek licensed LeMond's name for use on a line of its bicycles, believing that the cachet of the name, a diversifying brand portfolio, plus having models offering a longer top tube than Trek's frame geometries helped to expand the bicycle-sales opportunities for the Trek corporation. In September 2013, LeMond partnered with Time Sports to produce a limited run of 300 frames to commemorate his three Tour victories in 1986, 1989, and 1990. In August 2014, Greg LeMond launched the Washoe, a Reynolds 853 steel bike manufactured in the United States. Greg LeMond 1991 Tour. Greg LeMond was a pioneer in the use of carbon fiber bicycle frames in European professional road cycling, and his Tour de France win in 1986 ahead of Bernard Hinault was the first for carbon. LeMond rode a \\"Bernard Hinault\\" Signature Model Look prototype that year. LeMond also won the 1989 Tour and World's, and his final Tour de France in 1990 on carbon fiber frames, which had begun to feature \\"Greg LeMond\\" branding. Company founding In 1986, LeMond founded LeMond Bicycles to develop machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public. In 1990, searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the 1991 Tour de France, LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and Carbonframes, Inc., to access the latter's advanced composites technology. While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour while riding his Carbonframes-produced \\"Greg LeMond\\" bicycle, the company faltered, something LeMond blamed on \\"undercapitalization\\" and poor management by his father,Interview in Rouleur, Guy Andrews, issue five, p. 26 although Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles \\"parted amiably two years later.\\" In 1995, LeMond reached a licensing agreement with Trek, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the \\"LeMond Bicycles\\" brand. LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek \\"destroyed\\" his relationship with his father. In 2001 the Trek deal proved painful for LeMond as he was forced by John Burke, the head of Trek, to apologize for the negative comments about Michele Ferrari, doping, and Lance Armstrong, who was by then a very important marketing force for Trek. LeMond's contract with Trek had a clause prohibiting LeMond from doing anything that would damage Trek. Burke reminded LeMond of this commitment, and strongly argued that LeMond publicly retract his statements. LeMond read a formal apology to Armstrong. In March 2008 LeMond Cycling Inc filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract, claiming that they had not made a \\"best efforts\\" attempt to sell his bicycles, as well as describing the attempts to 'silence' him about doping, including incidents in 2001 and 2004. His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold $10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, a country in which LeMond remains both famous and popular.\\"It's Not About the Bikes,\\" Nathaniel Vinton, New York Daily News, November 7, 2009 Complaint, LeMond Cycling Inc, vs Trek Bicycle Corporation , 2008 3 20, retr 2012 10 13. from trekbikes.com.

Conflicts with Armstrong and Trek According to the United States Anti-Doping Agency 2012 doping report, based on affidavits by Frankie and Betsy Andreu, in 2001 Lance Armstrong reacted to LeMond's negative comments about Doctor Michele Ferrari and Armstrong by saying he would \\"take him down\\" and that he could call Trek's owner and \\"shut him up\\". According to a 2012 Outside story by Armstrong assistant Mike Anderson, Armstrong said he would ‚Äúput LeMond out of business‚Äù over comments about him and Ferrari.My Life With Lance Armstrong, Mike Anderson, August 31, 2012, retr 10 14 2012 In March 2008, LeMond Cycling Inc prepared a lawsuit against Trek, accusing them of bowing to pressure from \\"third parties\\" to \\"wind down\\" his brand through lack of distribution and promotion, especially in the European market. The complaint also says that \\"Since 2001, Trek has systematically sought to silence Mr. LeMond's right to make comments that constitute an informed and honest opinion on matters of legitimate public interest - the problems associated with the use of performance enhancing substances\\". For example, * In 2001, shortly after LeMond made negative comments about doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Lance Armstrong, the complaint alleges that \\"Trek contacted Mr. LeMond to notify him that Mr. LeMond's comments in the article upset Mr. Armstrong\\". *The complaint states that in 2001 John Burke of Trek contacted LeMond and \\"wanted Mr LeMond to issue a statement that had been drafted for him\\" regarding the Armstrong/Ferrari comments, and that if a suitable press release was not made, \\"Mr. Armstrong would sever his relationship with Trek and Mr. LeMond's relationship with Trek would suffer.\\" *LeMond \\"acquiesced to allow the release of a public statement that restated his views regarding Dr. Ferrari\\" but the statement was printed in USA Today as though it were an interview. *In 2004 after LeMond's interview with a French newspaper where he made negative comments about Armstrong, Trek claimed that LeMond was in breach of the \\"Moral turpitude\\" section of their business agreement. *LeMond was disinvited from the 2006 Trek dealer show, and not invited to the 2007 dealer show nor the 2007 Trek 100 charity ride. LeMond talked about some of these issues in a 2012 interview with the Irish radio program NewsTalk as well. Trek responded to the lawsuit in 2008 by suing to sever business ties with LeMond. Trek's press release said that \\"LeMond‚Äôs suit was characterized by Burke as containing false and irresponsible allegations \\". Burke also said \\"for years, Greg LeMond has done and said things that have damaged the LeMond brand and the Trek brand as a whole\\".... \\"His actions are inconsistent with our values‚Äîvalues we believe in and live everyday. And after years of trying to make it work, we are done.\\" Models LeMond Tete de Course road bike Lemond Pink and Black road bike during the 2011 MS150:City to Shore. 1997 Black LeMond OCLV Maillot Jaune 2007 Lemond Buenos Aires * Reno * Nevada City * Wayzata * Buenos Aires * Versailles * Tourmalet * Alpe d'Huez * Big Sky SLT * Tete de Course * Etape * Poprad * Sarthe * Fillmore * Zurich * Chamb√©ry * M J Classic * Maillot Jaune * Rennes * Limoges * Victoire * Arrivee * Croix de Fer * LTD 86 *LTD 89 *LTD 90 *Washoe References *1997 Lemond Bicycle Catalog, *2002 Lemond Bicycle Catalog, *2007 Lemond Bicycle Catalog.

There were 35 nations competing. United States ran the event without their top two qualifiers from the Olympic Trials. world record holder Butch Reynolds was injured before the games and 400 meters gold medalist Michael Johnson was injured during his 200 metres 19.32 world record. Seizing the opportunity of a weakened US squad, Britain's Iwan Thomas shot out to a lead from the gun putting a big gap on USA's Lamont Smith to his inside. Reality set in and Thomas began to tie up toward the end of his leg, allowing Smith to gain back to almost even with Thomas by the handoff, with Michael McDonald putting Jamaica into third position. Alvin Harrison ran a solid turn and looked to put America in the lead at the break, but Jamie Baulch sprinted past him on the outside to put the Brits back in the lead. Harrison held his position behind Baulch all the way until the end of the second turn, with Greg Haughton bringing Jamaica into the three-team breakaway for the medals. Harrison steadily gained on the last half of the turn pulling even by the straightaway, then cleanly separated, putting USA in the lead. Haughton followed Harrison around Baulch running down lane 2 trying to catch Harrison. USA and GBR exchanged cleanly on the inside, but as Haughton handed off to Roxbert Martin, they crossed legs with Martin coming out doing a full somersault, Jamaica losing a couple of steps on Derek Mills leading for the Americans, with Mark Richardson in hot pursuit. Richardson pulled in the gap to Mills, looking poised to pounce coming off the final turn, but Mills held him off and pulled away down the straight. Mills handed off to Anthuan Maybank, whose selection to the U.S. team was controversial. Maybank was not selected for the individual race because he had been disqualified for a lane violation in the Olympic Trials. Normally, the top six finishers would be selected and he technically did not finish.http://www.legacy.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf Now in the absence of Johnson and Reynolds, he was thrust into the potential hero's role of anchoring the American team. With a three-meter deficit to make up, Britain's silver medalist Roger Black had other ideas. Black steadily gained on Maybank and was in perfect position to pass coming off the final turn. But Maybank never let him by, lifting his knees and pulling away from Black to bring USA home with a four-metre victory for the gold medal. Davian Clarke brought Jamaica home for bronze three seconds later. Behind the medalists, Senegal made a terrible final handoff behind Japan, leaving them even with Poland on the final lap. Ibou Faye made up the deficit, passing Japan's Shigekazu ≈åmori and finished setting a new National Record that survived two decades.

Plot  Dr. Satyajit Chavan is the head doctor at a civil hospital in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, most of whom are young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job is to treat patients and that beds must be allocated to the ones who are most likely to survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment. Sarbajeet \\"Saby\\" Singh and Kashmira Singh are a young Punjabi couple; they are about to marry. In a departure from the arranged marriages, they have chosen each other independently. They invite their parents to a joint dinner and inform them of their choice. The parents are cheerful to oblige, and they gladly arrange the wedding ceremony. Once married, however, Saby and Kashmira discover their varying interests and aspirations. The main conflict is around cricket: Saby is a great fan of cricket, and Kashmira does not care very much for the sport. Saby watches every India match with unfailing zeal. Kashmira however is left alone and unattended, and she gradually feels abandoned and unloved. Hemendra \\"Hemu\\" Patel is a janitor working at a London airport. He represents the journey of a poor immigrant. His main goal is to secure British citizenship so that he can return to India with great ceremony (as he has seen bestowed upon his other relatives who have attained foreign citizenship). He deals with the cultural differences of his UK-inclined teenage daughter. His wife Priya is affectionate and supportive. Though she does not share his obsequious quest for British citizenship, she generally encourages him to achieve his goals. David Abraham, affectionately called \\"Chinaman\\" by fans, is a celebrated Indian cricketer. He has retired from active international cricket, but he is frequently invited to games (for commentary), functions and sporting events as the guest of honor. Saby's parents confront him. They point out that he has ignored Kashmira in his zealous enthusiasm for cricket. How will she be able to love him when he is not able to understand her needs? He finally understands this, and returns to Kashmira with a renewed zest for making her happy. They are reunited.

A performance lasts about forty minutes. The aria \\"Schafe k√∂nnen sicher weiden\\" (\\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\") is the most familiar part of this cantata.  History and text  It is Bach's earliest surviving secular cantata, composed while he was employed as court organist in Weimar. The work may have been intended as a gift from Bach's employer, William Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, for his neighbouring ruler, Duke Christian, who was a keen hunter. Bach is known to have stayed in Wei√üenfels in 1713 for the birthday celebrations. He went on to earn more commissions from Saxe-Weissenfels, and in 1729, Bach was appointed Royal Kapellmeister, but this position as court composer did not require residence at court.  Text  The text is by Salomon Franck, the Weimar court poet, who published it in Geist- und Weltlicher Poesien Zweyter Theil (Jena, 1716). The music was published in 1881 in the first complete edition of the composer's works, the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe. As was common at the time, Franck's flattering text draws on classical mythology and features such characters as Diana, the goddess of the hunt. Franck also followed convention in associating good government with the hunt. As well as displaying the hunter's daring, hunting was supposed to develop patience and collaboration.Allsen, T. (2006). The Royal Hunt in Eurasian History The text praises Duke Christian as a wise ruler as well as a keen hunter. In reality, the Duke was to prove a spendthrift whose habits resulted in the financial collapse of his duchy.  Scoring and structure  The cantata was scored for four vocalist soloists: * Diana, soprano I * Pales, soprano II * Endymion, tenor * Pan, bass The instrumental parts comprised two horns, two recorders, two oboes, taille, bassoon, two violins, viola, cello, violone, and continuo. Recorders are appropriate for their pastoral associations and horns for their hunting associations. So far as is known, it is Bach's earliest work featuring horns. He is assumed to have been writing for horn players employed at the Weissenfels court, where there was a tradition of brass playing. There has been speculation that the cantata opened with a sinfonia (BWV 1046a), which has similar scoring to the cantata and is an early version of Brandenburg Concerto No. 1 in F major (BWV 1046). The sinfonia seems to be intended for more able horn players than required for the cantata, and may have been composed later, but it appears in some recorded versions of the cantata, for example those of Goodman and Suzuki. Accessed via Highbeam Research (subscription required). The work has fifteen movements: # Recitative: Was mir behagt, ist nur die muntre Jagd! (in F major/B flat major, for soprano I with continuo) # Aria: Jagen ist die Lust der G√∂tter (in F major, for soprano I with 2 horns and continuo) # Recitative: Wie, sch√∂nste G√∂ttin? wie?

Arrangements   Adaptations by Bach  Bach appears to have revived the work a few years after its original performance, this time in honour of Duke Ernst August, the co-ruler of Saxe-Weimar, who was also a hunter (BWV 208.2).Work at Bach Digital website. While he was living in Leipzig he arranged music from two arias for the church cantata Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt, BWV 68 (composed in 1725) and the final chorus for Man singet mit Freuden vom Sieg, BWV 149 (1728 or 1729). Bach further adapted the entire cantata in 1742 as a name day cantata for Augustus III (BWV 208.3).Work at Bach Digital website.  Adaptations by other people  So far as is known, \\"Sheep may safely graze\\" is not one of the numbers from the cantata which Bach chose to rearrange, but a variety of arrangements by other people exist. It is often played at weddings. \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\" can be played effectively on the piano, for example in the arrangement by the American composer Mary Howe. Australian-born composer Percy Grainger wrote several \\"free rambles\\" on Bach's \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\". He first wrote \\"Blithe Bells\\" (as he called his free ramble), for \\"elastic scoring\\" between November 1930 and February 1931. In March 1931, he scored a wind band version. It became one of his most famous arrangements. British composer William Walton re-orchestrated \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\" for a ballet score based on music by Bach, The Wise Virgins. The ballet was created in 1940 with choreography by Frederick Ashton. American composer and electronic musician Wendy Carlos arranged and recorded \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\" on a Moog synthesizer for her 1973 album Switched-On Bach II.  Selected recordings  *J.S.

It is located on John Street in Amityville, New York, but the official description of its location is not as precise. The MTA describes the station as being located on John Street between Sunrise Highway (NY 27) and NY 27A west of NY 110. John Street is located between Sterling Place and West Oak Street (Old Sunrise Highway, NY 900D). History Amityville station is typical of the elevated Babylon Branch stations that were rebuilt during the mid-to-late 20th century. It was originally built in 1868 by the South Side Railroad of Long Island, then replaced by a brick station in 1889. From 1890 to 1919, it was a stop for the Huntington Railroad cross-island trolley line, which included a bridge over the tracks on the west side of the station. It was also the terminus of the Amityville Line for of the Babylon Railroad trolley line from 1910 to 1920. When the trolleys were abandoned the cross-island trolley bridge over the tracks became a pedestrian crossover.Close-up picture of former Amityville Trolley Bridge in 1964, by Bradford G. Phillips (TrainsAreFun.com) The station building was completely demolished in 1964 and on October 25, 1968, a temporary station building was opened with high-level side platforms to accommodate the new M1 cars and facilitate the construction of the new grade separated Babylon Branch. The new elevated structure was opened on August 7, 1973. The 1868 station remains standing as a private residence. Amityville is also the site of the first interlocking after the Central Branch splits from the Babylon Branch.

Overview Henry Olmino, Jeronimo Gomez and Mathew Crum had played together in As Friends Rust for the first demo. The band soon broke up, and they moved on to Red Letter Day in which they oriented towards the indie rock sound. After some years of playing together, the band recruited Jolie Lindholm from their college, and called themselves \\"The Rocking Horse Winner\\" after a short story by D. H. Lawrence. The band was quickly signed after making a split demo. Their first album State of Feeling Concentration came out on Ohev Records in 2001. It was recognized among the underground and indie scene, and got the band to start touring. The band moved on to Equal Vision Records for their last album, during a period where the label was signing less heavy bands. This would be the last of the band, and each member moved onto self projects.

Dorset is a county in South West England. The county is largely rural and therefore does not have a dense transport network, and is one of the few English counties without a motorway. Due to its position on the English Channel coast, and its natural sheltered harbours, it has a maritime history, though lack of inland transport routes have led to the decline of its ports.  Rail  Dorset's railways, past and present. Dorset is connected to London by two main railway lines. The West of England Main Line runs through the north of the county at Gillingham and Sherborne. The electric South Western Main Line runs through the south of the county, at Bournemouth, Poole, Dorchester and the terminus at Weymouth, and was part of the London and South Western Railway (later Southern Railway). Additionally, a secondary line, the Heart of Wessex Line runs from Weymouth to Bristol, via Yeovil and Bath, in Somerset. This line was part of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (later Great Western Railway). Railway closures in Dorset began with the West Bay line south of Bridport in the 1930s. Then lost in the 1950s were the branch lines to Abbotsbury and Portland. The Beeching Axe of the 1960s led to the closure of other Dorset lines, the Lyme Regis and Bridport branches. The latter remained open until 1975 although the Beeching report was published in 1963. The biggest loss was the entire Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, between Bournemouth and Bath. Through Dorset, this line roughly followed the Stour Valley, serving the market towns of Blandford Forum and Sturminster Newton in the Blackmore Vale, and is being converted into a long-distance trail for cyclists and walkers. Another through line, the Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway, roughly followed the Avon Valley from Bournemouth to Salisbury. With the closure of the lines which terminated in Bournemouth, the terminus station in the town centre was also closed, leaving only the through stations. The station at Semley on the West of England Main Line also closed. As this had been the nearest station to Shaftesbury, travellers from that town would have to use Gillingham, on the same line. An oddity is the Swanage Branch. Although omitted from the Beeching plan this line closed in 1972 and most of the track was lifted. However it has now been rebuilt as a heritage railway.  Roads  Dorset is one of only five non metropolitan counties in England to not have a single motorway, however, two trunk road corridors run east‚Äìwest through the county. In the north, the A303 London to Exeter and Cornwall road briefly enters the county, though for most of its route it is north of the borders with Somerset and Wiltshire. Further south, the A31, a continuation of the M27 motorway from Hampshire, serves as a northern bypass for the South East Dorset conurbation, merging into the A35 to continue west through the county, bypassing Dorchester and Bridport. Several primary routes also run through the county. These are: * A338, Bournemouth relief road, and through route to Salisbury. * A35, from its split from the A31 trunk road, east through Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch. * A350, Poole relief road, and through route to the A303, via Blandford Forum and Shaftesbury. * A354, from Weymouth and Portland to Salisbury, via Dorchester and Blandford Forum. * A37, from Dorchester to Yeovil and Bristol. Other 'A' roads are: * A30, London to the West Country, runs east‚Äìwest through the north of the county, between Shaftesbury and Sherborne, but through traffic is directed to the A303, which acts as a bypass for the towns on the A30. * A351, Poole to Swanage, via Wareham. * A352, Sherborne to Wareham, via Dorchester. * A353, Weymouth, to the A352 east of Dorchester. * A356, from the A37 west of Dorchester, to the A303 west of Yeovil, Somerset. * A357, Blandford Forum to the A303 at Wincanton, Somerset, via Sturminster Newton and the Blackmore Vale. * A3030, Between Sherborne, and the A357 near Sturminster Newton. * A3066, Between Bridport, and the A30 at Crewkerne, Somerset. * The suburban roads of the South East Dorset conurbation (Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch): the A341, A347, A348, A349, A3049, and A3060.  International  The only passenger airport in the county is Bournemouth International Airport, and there are two passenger sea ports, at Poole and Weymouth.

The piece was written in 1713 and is part of the cantata . The cantata's title translates The lively hunt is all my heart's desire, and it is also known as the Hunting Cantata. Like the same composer's \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\", Sheep may safely graze is frequently played at weddings. However, the cantata of which it forms a part was originally written for a birthday celebration, that of Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. Bach was based at the nearby court of Weimar, and musicians from both courts appear to have joined together in the first performance in Wei√üenfels. Bach is known to have used the music again for other celebrations, but it remained unpublished until after his death. Instrumentation For this number (movement 9 of the complete work), the singer is not accompanied by the full Baroque instrumental ensemble used elsewhere in the cantata, but by two recorders and continuo. The use of flute-like instruments is typical of pastoral music. Since the revival of Bach's music in the 19th century, \\"Sheep may safely graze\\" has been arranged for other instruments. Text The piece's English title is well known enough for it to evoke a pastoral scene: it has been referenced in discussions of how European culture depicts domestic animals and sheep in particular. Franck's words are given to mythological characters, in this case Pales, a deity of shepherds, flocks, and livestock. Pales compares the peaceful life of sheep under a watchful shepherd to the inhabitants of a state with a wise ruler. Schafe k√∂nnen sicher weiden Wo ein guter Hirte wacht. Wo Regenten wohl regieren Kann man Ruh' und Friede sp√ºren Und was L√§nder gl√ºcklich macht. Sheep may safely graze and pasture In a watchful Shepherd's sight. Those who rule with wisdom guiding Bring to hearts a peace abiding Bless a land with joy made bright. Recordings The work has been often recorded. It can be found in: * recordings of the complete cantata, for example: ** Bach: Secular Cantatas Vol. 2 (Hunting Cantata plus Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht).

Almost immediately, the route crosses the far northeastern corner of Wrentham before passing into the town of Norfolk. In Norfolk the route crosses Route 1A before continuing northwestward, passing Stony Brook Pond and the Bristol Blake State Reservation before crossing through the center of town near the Norfolk commuter rail station. From there, Route 115 continues northward into Millis, crossing the Charles River and intersecting Route 109 at the center of town. It then continues northward, crossing into Sherborn. Once in Sherborn, the route shortly ends at Route 27, just west of that route's crossing of the Charles River into the town of Medfield. Route 115 is in large part a scenic highway, mostly meandering through rather dense woods, with the exception being the town center of Millis, which is home to many shops and banks.

In the end, the town is revealed as Stratford-upon-Avon, with the epitaph on the grave of William Shakespeare providing both the location and the title of the story. Employing a third-person objective narrator and a very matter-of-fact style, the story achieves a chilling effect despite completely omitting descriptions of human tragedy and suffering. Instead, it merely shows the bleakness of the completely depopulated ruins of the town and surrounding landscape, interspersed with sparse hints of how its destruction fit into the global events. Concepts like mutual assured destruction, nuclear overkill and (insufficient) missile defence systems are also hinted at.

Located across the Downtown Connector from Downtown Atlanta, the Midtown Mile is one of the major thoroughfares of central Atlanta in terms of retail and rapid residential development. History Although Peachtree Street has long been Atlanta's most famous roadway, the idea of building a dense mixed-use corridor along a stretch of the road in Midtown began in 1997 when a neighbourhood group known as the Midtown Alliance published \\"Blueprint Midtown,\\" a wide-ranging report advocating the need for pedestrian and transport-based development throughout Midtown, focusing specifically on the Peachtree Street Corridor, which has since been nicknamed \\"Midtown Mile,\\" a pun on Chicago's Magnificent Mile.Blueprint Midtown Midtown Alliance Retrieved 2009-08-31 Such development had been planned for decades - the Midtown Alliance began in 1978 - but only in recent years has the potential for growth been fully realised.

Life Teseo Tesei was born in Marina de Campo, Elba in 1909, the son of Ulisse Tesey and Rosa Carassale. After attending the Collegio degli Scolopi in Florence, he entered the Livorno Naval Academy in 1931, where he distinguished himself for perseverance and inventiveness. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and graduated from the Naval engineering school in Naples in 1933. He subsequently had several posts on both surface ships and submarines. He was a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War with the rank of captain. In 1929, Tesei had the idea of the manned torpedo, from the Italian device used to sink the Austrian Battleship Viribus Unitis during World War I, and invented for the Italian Regia Marina what was later called the Maiale. *In 1931: He entered the Naval Academy of Livorno, where he showed his inventive capabilities. Together with Elios Toschi he designed a human torpedo called Siluro a lenta corsa (SLC), later nicknamed the Maiale (Italian for \\"pig\\", because it proved to be difficult to steer). *1936: He improved the attack performance of his creation, the \\"Maiale\\", using an enhanced system (that he invented) to breathe under water for two hours. The SLC was extensively used in World War II by the Italian Navy, and obtained even the sinking of two British battleships in Alexandria. The British developed another kind of manned torpedo, called a \\"Chariot\\", from one of his captured \\"Maiali\\". *1938: He was one of the officers with Prince Valerio Borghese who organized the Decima Flottiglia MAS. *21 August 1940: Tesei was the only survivor when the Italian submarine Iride was sunk (see Decima Flottiglia MAS#1940). *26 July 1941: Tesei died riding a manned torpedo attacking Malta (see Decima Flottiglia MAS#1941). Teseo Tesei was posthumously awarded the Italian Gold Medal for Military Honor for this military action. The modern Italian commando frogmen group COMSUBIN (Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei ed Incursori Teseo Tesei) is named after him.

He was educated at Trinity School of John Whitgift, and the South Bank Polytechnic, eventually receiving his doctorate at the Victoria University of Manchester. He went on to join the University of Essex in 1973, eventually rising to the chair of Professor of Sociology. During his time at the University, he gained an international reputation in sociology, and is widely read as a theoretician who ably links sociology and psychoanalysis. In the mid-1980s, he received qualification as a psychotherapist and group analyst, bringing together his interests in the reciprocal effects between individuals, groups and societies. In the late 1980s he was central ‚Äî along with Karl Figlio, Joan Busfield, Ken Plummer and John Walshe ‚Äî to the creation of a master's degree in Sociology and Psychotherapy, organised jointly by the University of Essex and the Mental Health Trust. This was one of the first university courses of its type in the country, combining clinical experience with theoretical thinking. Craib's working-class origins influenced his understanding of class systems and the politics of power, and this partly explains his attachment in his late teens to Trotskyite parties. He later rejected them, however, because of their authoritarianism. Unfair treatment and unequal distribution of power and influence angered him. In the psychoanalytic field he encouraged the sharing of the difficulties, pain, joy and fun of group psychotherapeutic work. The need to get things right, the wonder at how interpretations were so often lost and ignored, the question of whether one should be working with the deep unconscious in therapeutic groups or making comments at the overt conscious level were constant themes that he brought to discussions. He died of cancer on the December 22, 2002, at the age of 57.

Founded in 1986 by brothers Francis and Moyses Howard under the name Incubus, Natives of Rio de Janeiro, the Howards emigrated to New Orleans and formed the band. The original incarnation featured bassist/lead vocalist Scot Latour, and the trio's 1987 demo Supernatural Death landed them a deal with the small Brutal Records imprint. Their official debut, Serpent Temptation, was released in 1988; however, LaTour departed soon afterwards, leaving Francis to take over vocal duties. Incubus signed with Nuclear Blast in 1990 and soon released their follow-up Beyond the Unknown; recording with Francis on bass as well, Incubus eventually tabbed Mark Lavenia as the full-time bassist. But shortly thereafter, in 1991, Incubus disbanded, then reappeared after a ten-year break from the music business, being forced to change their name in order to avoid confusion with newly emerging rock band Incubus from California. They released their album Discerning Forces on Nuclear Blast Records in 2000. The band is noted for their particular style, a death/thrash metal crossover, combined with lyrics about death, violence and occasionally Christian references. Francis Howard and Scot Latour sang background vocals on the song \\"Stronger Than Hate\\", the third track on the Sepultura album Beneath the Remains. Francis Howard did guest session vocals on two Cannibal Corpse songs on the album Eaten Back to Life. The band is currently signed to Metal Mind Productions. On July 21, 2009, the band announced that the original bassist, Scot W. Latour, had re- joined the band, after 20 years. In 2017, there was some controversy around the band; it was thought that Metallica stole riffs from the band, when they were Incubus. It was later discovered that this was not true, but this brought attention to the band. The band did not agree with the claims of plagiarism, only the record label released a statement stating about this. Members ; Current members * Francis M.

Life and works Duncan McLean was born in Fraserburgh and has lived in Orkney since 1992. While based in Edinburgh in the 1980s, he started writing songs, stand-up routines, and plays for the Merry Mac Fun Co, a street theatre and comedy act with agitprop tendencies. The Merry Macs won various awards, and were twice nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award.Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Awards 2013 - Best Comedy Show In the 1990s McLean was part of a loose grouping of writers centred on Edinburgh whose characters were mainly poor, working class and young, whose themes were drugs, drink, dance music, violence and alienation, and who took their inspiration variously from the Glaswegian writers of the previous generation, notably James Kelman, and from overseas writers like Richard Brautigan and Knut Hamsun. Among the so-called \\"Beats of Edinburgh\\", besides McLean, were Irvine Welsh, Alan Warner, Laura Hird and Gordon Legge, along with the publisher Kevin Williamson.The Beats of Edinburgh - New York Times In December 1990, with the writer James Meek, McLean set up and ran the Clocktower Press, a small but influential publishing house, which helped bring a new generation of Scottish writers to wider attention. McLean, Meek and the artist Eddie Farrell invested ¬£50 each to print the first booklet, Safe/Lurch, with both writers contributing a story and Farrell illustrating the cover. After the first three booklets Meek moved to Kiev and McLean went on to publish seven more, including the first separately-published extracts of what would later become Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting. The fifth of the Clocktower series, it was printed in April 1992 in an edition of 300 under the title Past Tense: four stories from a novel. In 1992, McLean published his first book, a collection of short stories called Bucket of Tongues, and since then has published several more books, including the acclaimed coming-of-age novel Blackden and a collection of plays, entitled Plays:One. In 1995 he published the novel Bunker Man and in 1998 his travelogue Lone Star Swing was published, which saw McLean tracing the roots of country music precursor Bob Wills. In recent years, he has divided his time between writing, music, and running an off-license. In 2006, he won the prestigious trade award, UK Restaurant Wine Supplier of the Year, and ten years later a major New Zealand Wine merchant award. In 2007 he founded the annual Orkney Wine Festival, the only event of its kind in Scotland.Bot generated title --> A new series of theatre pieces began with a translation of Aalst, a Belgian play by Pol Heyvaert, which toured the UK and Australia for the National Theatre of Scotland in 2007.Duncan McLean  An introduction to Aalst  National Theatre of Scotland McLean leads a western swing band called the Lone Star Swing band, which in 2009 and 2010 toured Scotland and Ireland in a new McLean play, \\"Long Gone Lonesome.\\" With a slightly different cast, the play toured five US states in 2012. Telling the story of the reclusive Shetland musician Thomas Fraser, the play was produced by the National Theatre of Scotland, and directed by Vicky Featherstone. 'Long Gone Lonesome' was featured in the BBC TV documentary, 'National Theatre of Scotland: A Dramatic Decade' broadcast in September 2016. The 2015 St Magnus Festival staged a new play, 'Telling the Truth Beautifully: The Trial of James Kirkness' - a story of gin smuggling and political change in 19th century Kirkwall. In November 2015, McLean launched a new lo-fi imprint, the Abersee Press, with a booklet of contemporary Orkney-language writing by eight poets and story writers, including Harry Giles and Alison Miller. Abersee's professed goal is to kick-start a new wave of north-isles writing, as the Clocktower Press did for Edinburgh in the 1990s. A second anthology was published in May 2017; titled Speak For Yourself, it featured three New Zealand writers - CK Stead, Hera Lindsay Bird and Craig Marriner - as well as three Orkney writers. An introduction by McLean speaks of the legacy of pioneering New Zealand writer Frank Sargeson and his role as an inspiration for writers from outlying communities. He has also written about Sargeson for the London Review of Books.

Clarke, first published in 1953. Plot summary A swarm of disembodied aliens, whose home world was destroyed, are in search of an animal species which they can inhabit and guide to intelligence. Finding a promising reptilian species on one planet, some of their number remain while the rest continue the search. Those who remain return each year to a certain location on the planet's surface, in case the swarm returns, and they continue to seek out this place even millions of years after it sinks into the planet's ocean. The end reveals the fate of these aliens and their hosts. Publication history The story appears in the following collections. * Reach for Tomorrow * The Collected Stories of Arthur C.

Dinamo Zagreb On 30 January 2006 Carlos joined Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb. The club paid his transfer ‚Ç¨40,000. At first he was playing on a centre‚Äìback position, but in recent seasons he had much more impact as a left full‚Äìback. Carlos also spent six months on loan in Varteks during the 2008‚Äì09 season, after he found himself out of manager Marijan Vlak's plans. Following his return he often started in the first‚Äìeleven, but found himself on the bench again when the club signed Leandro Cufr√©. On February 5, 2010, it was announced on the official site of Shandong Luneng that they signed him. In January 2011, he was loaned to NK Zagreb. He played in five games, scoring a goal in the last round match against Hrvatski Dragovoljac. In July 2011, his contract with Dinamo Zagreb was terminated by mutual consent. Ettifaq He was subsequently signed by the Saudi club Ettifaq FC from Dammam. After two seasons with Ettifaq Carlos left the club. Zob Ahan In 2013 Carlos signed with Iran Pro League side Zob Ahan. In his first year with the club, he made 15 league appearance and helped Zob Ahan avoid relegation. On 1 June 2014, Santos renewed his contract with Zob Ahan, signed a two-year contract until 2016.

It is played by two people with a pile of coins (or other tokens) between them. The players take turns removing coins from the pile, always removing a non-zero square number of coins. The game is usually played as a normal play game, which means that the player who removes the last coin wins. It is an impartial game, meaning that the set of moves available from any position does not depend on whose turn it is. Solomon W. Golomb credits the invention of this game to Richard A. Epstein..  Example  A normal play game starting with 13 coins is a win for the first player provided (s)he starts with a subtraction of 1: player 1: 13 - 1*1 = 12 Player 2 now has three choices: subtract 1, 4 or 9. In each of these cases, player 1 can ensure that within a few moves the number 2 gets passed on to player 2: player 2: 12 - 1*1 = 11 player 2: 12 - 2*2 = 8 player 2: 12 - 3*3 = 3 player 1: 11 - 3*3 = 2 player 1: 8 - 1*1 = 7 player 1: 3 - 1*1 = 2 player 2: 7 - 1*1 = 6 or: 7 - 2*2 = 3 player 1: 6 - 2*2 = 2 3 - 1*1 = 2 Now player 2 has to subtract 1, and player 1 subsequently does the same: player 2: 2 - 1*1 = 1 player 1: 1 - 1*1 = 0 player 2 loses  Mathematical theory  In the above example, the number '13' represents a winning or 'hot' position, whilst the number '2' represents a losing or 'cold' position. Given an integer list with each integer labeled 'hot' or 'cold', the strategy of the game is simple: try to pass on a 'cold' number to your opponent. This is always possible provided you are being presented a 'hot' number. Which numbers are 'hot' and which numbers are 'cold' can be determined recursively: 1) the number 0 is 'cold', whilst 1 is 'hot' 2) if all numbers 1 .. N have been classified as either 'hot' or 'cold', then 2a) the number N+1 is 'cold' if only 'hot' numbers can be reached by subtracting a positive square 2b) the number N+1 is 'hot' if at least one 'cold' number can be reached by subtracting a positive square Using this algorithm, a list of cold numbers is easily derived: :0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34, 39, 44, ‚Ä¶ A faster divide and conquer algorithm can compute the same sequence of numbers, up to any threshold n, in time O(n\\\\log^2 n). There are infinitely many cold numbers. More strongly, the number of cold numbers up to some threshold n must be at least proportional to the square root of n, for otherwise there would not be enough of them to provide winning moves from all the hot numbers. Cold numbers tend to end in 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9. Cold values that end with other digits are quite uncommon. This holds in particular for cold numbers ending in 6. Out of all the over 180,000 cold numbers less than 40 million, only one ends in a 6: 11,356. No two cold numbers can differ by a square, because if they did then a move from the larger of the two to the smaller would be winning, contradicting the assumption that they are both cold. Therefore, by the Furstenberg‚ÄìS√°rk√∂zy theorem, the natural density of the cold numbers is zero. That is, for every \\\\epsilon > 0, and for all sufficiently large n, the fraction of the numbers up to n that are cold is less than \\\\epsilon. More strongly, for every n there are :O(n/(\\\\log n)^{\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log n}) cold numbers up to The exact growth rate of the cold numbers remains unknown, but experimentally the number of cold positions up to any given threshold n appears to be roughly n^{0.7}.  Extensions  The game subtract-a-square can also be played with multiple numbers. At each turn the player to make a move first selects one of the numbers, and then subtracts a square from it. Such a 'sum of normal games' can be analysed using the Sprague‚ÄìGrundy theorem. This theorem states that each position in the game subtract-a-square may be mapped onto an equivalent nim heap size. Optimal play consists of moving to a collection of numbers such that the nim-sum of their equivalent nim heap sizes is zero, when this is possible. The equivalent nim heap size of a position may be calculated as the minimum excluded value of the equivalent sizes of the positions that can be reached by a single move. For subtract-a-square positions of values 0, 1, 2, ... the equivalent nim heap sizes are :0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, ‚Ä¶ . In particular, a position of subtract-a-square is cold if and only if its equivalent nim heap size is zero. It is also possible to play variants of this game using other allowed moves than the square numbers. For instance, Golomb defined an analogous game based on the Moser‚Äìde Bruijn sequence, a sequence that grows at a similar asymptotic rate to the squares, for which it is possible to determine more easily the set of cold positions and to define an easily computed optimal move strategy.  Mis√®re game  Subtract-a-square can also be played as a mis√®re game, in which the player to make the last subtraction loses. The recursive algorithm to determine 'hot' and 'cold' numbers for the mis√®re game is the same as that for the normal game, except that for the mis√®re game the number 1 is 'cold' whilst 2 is 'hot'. It follows that the cold numbers for the mis√®re variant are the cold numbers for the normal game shifted by 1: Mis√®re play 'cold' numbers: 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 35, 40, 45, ...

Its long, slender legs and tail give it a spider-like impression and allow it to climb in its rocky habitat. The toes are slender, clawed, and angularly bent. It shares this feature with a number of other species and is classified as an angular- toed gecko. Two other species, Agamura femoralis (Smith, 1933) and Agamura misonnei (De Witte, 1973), have been placed in the genus, but Anderson (1999) and Khan (2003) referred them to the genus Rhinogekko.Bauer, A. M., et al. (2013). A preliminary phylogeny of the Palearctic naked-toed geckos (Reptilia: Squamata: Gekkonidae) with taxonomic implications. Zootaxa 3599(4), 301-24. Diagnostic features Females range from 42 to 77 mm (SVL), with a tail of 34 to 59 mm, while males range from 35 to 65 mm, with a tail of 27 to 59 mm. Agamura persica has a light-grey upper body with yellow pigment and five dark crossbars almost as broad as the interspaces, with 9 to 10 on the tail and a flecked grey belly.Khan, M. S. (2006). Amphibians and Reptiles of Pakistan. Malabar, Florida: Krieger Publishing. Some colour and morphological differences exist between localities, but all are distinctly agamuroid. Subspecies Agamura persica ssp. persica is found in the eastern regions of the species' range (eastern Iran, Afghanistan), and is differentiated by \\"three dark crossbars, first on nape, second behind shoulders, third in front of sacrum\\". Agamura persica ssp. cruralis is found in the western regions (most of Iran) and is differentiated by \\"five darker brown dorsal crossbars, first on nape, fifth on sacrum, nine to ten on tail\\". Natural history The Persian spider gecko inhabits rocky and stony terrain close to sandy semidesert, on hill slopes and barren plains. It is primarily nocturnal, but can be found during the day basking at temperatures of about 17.5 ¬∞C (air) and 15.5 ¬∞C (surface), and active at surface temperatures as high as 44 ¬∞C. Agamura's \\"well-developed (but immovable) upper 'eyelid'\\" is an adaptation to diurnal life. The lid serves as a sort of \\"sunshade\\". The Persian spider gecko reaches breeding size at 18 to 24 months of age. Its breeding period is from March to May, eggs are laid in June, and juveniles appear in September. Sexing The male Agamura persica has an obvious hemipenal bulge visual from a side profile. The thin morphology of the gecko makes the bulge even more noticeable. The male also has two to four preanal pores, but a captive-bred male may have none to four. The female lacks a bulge and preanal pores entirely. The juvenile also lacks this bulge, but by about the eighth to 12th week (roughly 7‚Äì8 cm SVL) the male juvenile may begin to show slight bulging. It may happen as late as the fourth to sixth month.

According to a 1960 count, they numbered around 20,000 out of 640,000 Somalis in parts of Somalia that were within the then British Protectorate. Their numbers in other parts of Somalia and other Somali regions were unknown. The terms Madhiban, Muse Dheri, Midgan or Midgaan for this Somali caste are found in historic literature, but in modern discourse, the term Gaboye is increasingly common. This caste is distinct from the Tumal and Yibir outcast communities because each is accused of things different from each other in Somali society. Discussion The Madhiban were historically hunters, but now engage in occupations like leather work (shoemaking). They also are the traditional circumcision performers for both males,–ï. de Larajasse (1972), Somali-English and Somali-English Dictionary, Trubner, page 108 and females in the Somali society. These professions have traditionally been considered dirty, and the Madhiban have been a part of the sab or lower castes as opposed to the aji or upper castes. According to Lee Gunderson, Dennis Murphy Odo and Reginald D'Silva, the Midgan have traditionally been treated as a low caste, scorned and reviled. A Midgan-Madiban has been deemed as polluting and therefore avoided as a taboo in the Somali society.Mohamed A. Eno and Abdi M. Kusow (2014), Racial and Caste Prejudice in Somalia, Journal of Somali Studies, Iowa State University Press, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 91-92, 95-96, 108-112 Under Somalia's military administration, some Madhiban were appointed to positions within the government to promote integration. The Madhiban have since obtained wider political representation. Their general social status has also improved with the expansion of urban centers. Description from 1890 In 1890 √âlis√©e Reclus, in his extensive work \\"The Earth and its Inhabitants: AFRICA\\" (Vol. IV, South and East Africa) described the Madhiban (Midgan) as follows: > In still greater contempt are held the Midgans, called also Rami, that is to > say \\"Archers,\\" who are universally regarded as the lowest of the low. They > worship trees and snakes, and eat all the prohibited food, such as fish, > fowl, eggs, hares, and gazelles. They are also daring hunters, fearlessly > attacking the lion and the elephant, whom they pierce with their poisoned > arrows. Like the Yebirs, the Midgans also practise medicine, and have the > reputation of being extremely clever charlatans. According to the Somali > legends, the lower castes are the issue of crossings between Abyssinian > women and maleficent genii, while the Midgans are of still more degraded > origin, their ancestors having been the slaves of these Abyssinian > women.\\"The Earth and its Inhabitants: AFRICA\\", Vol. IV, South and East > Africa. By √âlys√©e Reclus. Edited by A.H. Keane B.A., New York, D. Appleton > and Company., 1890 (page 399). Law Under the 1951 UN convention, several legal proceedings have ruled that Midgan as a low caste in Somalia are \\"akin to Dalits or the untouchables in India\\". Cognate castes in Horn of Africa The Madhiban caste is not an exception limited to the Somali ethnic group, and equivalent cognate caste is found in numerous ethnic groups in Horn of Africa and East Africa. According to Donald Levine ‚Äì a professor of Sociology specializing in Ethiopian and Horn of Africa studies, similar caste groups in different languages and ethnic groups have been integral part of societies of this region. These strata have featured all the defining characteristics of caste, states Levine, characteristics such as \\"endogamy, hierarchy, status, concepts of pollution, restraints on commensality, a traditional occupation and membership by birth\\". In east Ethiopia ethnic groups, such as the Oromo people, cognates to Somali castes have been recorded in 16th century texts, states Cornelius Jaenen.Cornelius J. Jaenen (1956), The Galla or Oromo of East Ethiopia , Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, Vol. 12, No. 2 (Summer, 1956), pages 171-190 The table below illustrate some alternate terms for castes mirroring the Madhiban in other ethnic groups that share this region with the Somali people. {  + Castes equivalent to Madhiban in Horn of Africa !

The Tanzimat reforms, which began in 1839, along with other subsequent liberalization processes, were strongly opposed by conservatives in the Ottoman Empire. They hoped to re-affirm the monarchic powers of the Sultan Abdulhamid II as absolute monarch, even though the Sultan himself came to power accepting a Constitution and opening the first Ottoman parliament, the General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire, in 1876 during the First Constitutional Era. Parliament was adjourned in 1878 with the pretext of the Russian War and Abdulhamid II reigned as an absolute monarch for over 30 years until 1908, when Parliament resumed its activities in the Second Constitutional Era, upon pressure of the progressive forces in the Empire. However, a reactionary uprising that began on April 13, 1909 (March 31, 1325 AH in Rumi calendar) caused the democratic process to be interrupted once again. Progressive forces of the \\"Hareket Ordusu\\" (Turkish for \\"Army of Action\\") that came from the Rumelia, under the command of Mahmud »òevked Pasha, suppressed the countercoup on July 23, 1909. Abdulhamid II was deposed by the Committee of Union and Progress, the foremost constitutionalist party, and sent to exile in Salonica, then part of the Ottoman Empire. The monument was inaugurated in 1911, at the second anniversary of the 31 March Incident. The complex also holds the graves of four notable Ottoman high-ranked officials, which were moved here in a later time. The monument, seen today as a symbol of modernity, democracy, and secularism in Turkey,Denizce serves as a place of some official ceremonies and public gatherings.  Design  The monument is situated on the highest hill ( above the sea level) in ≈ûi≈üli, Istanbul, called \\"H√ºrriyet-i Ebediye Tepesi\\" (literally Eternal Liberty Hill) and lies today within a triangular area bordered by three major highways between ≈ûi≈üli and √áaƒülayan. It was designed by the renowned Ottoman architect Muzaffer Bey, who won the related architectural contest. The monument, constructed between 1909 and 1911 in the form of a cannon firing in the sky, is erected on an equilateral triangular base. On each side of the marble base, the names of the soldiers resting below are carved. On the monument, the tughra of Sultan Mehmed V Re≈üat is put on. It is situated in the center of a park with pathways like a pentagon star surrounded by a circle symbolizing the star and crescent in the Ottoman flag.  Burials  Tomb of Mehmed Talat Pasha At the monument, the 74 soldiers killed in action of the 31 March Incident were initially buried with a state ceremony on July 23, 1911. Remains of the below four high- ranking officials of the Ottoman Empire were buried here later on as well: * Midhat Pasha, a leading architect of the first Ottoman constitution and Grand Vizier, died in exile in Taif, Arabia. * Mahmud Shevket Pasha, commander of the Army of Action (Hareket Ordusu ), which put down the countercoup, and later Grand Vizier, assassinated in 1913. * Talaat Pasha, former Minister of Interior and Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire assassinated by Soghomon Tehlirian in 1921, whose remains were brought in 1943 from Berlin, Germany. * Enver Pasha, Minister of War and deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Ottoman armed forces during the First World War, killed in action in Russian Turkestan, whose remains were brought 1996 from Ab-i Derya, today TajikistanUslanmam-History of the Republic  Meeting point  The place serves as the meeting point for democracy and civil rights demonstrations in Istanbul.

Set in a former school building, the venue has left an indelible print on generations of the town's teenagers as the only major live venue in the town and the most recognised indie club remaining in regular operation following the closure of Bass Clef in 1999 and the Irish Centre in 1997. History The Roadmender started life as a youth club built in an entirely different location to the one on which it operates today. Named after the 1902 book by Michael Fairless, the club was established to cater for the \\"no-collar\\" bits and girls of the Boroughs area of Northampton. > \\"By 1937 the club nearly had 400 members and the club moved its headquarters > to Gloucester House in Far Cotton. The departure of founding father Mr > Harrison in 1939 didn‚Äôt curb the rapid growth of the organisation. > The value of Roadmender to the local community was obvious, so money was > found for brand new premises despite the imminent war. The Dalgleish- > designed building in Ladys Lane which houses Roadmender to this date, opened > in October 1940.

However, there is nothing particularly > posh about Roadmender, and everyone has been welcomed throughout the years.\\" In the 1980s The Roadmender hosted a community arts programme that included printing, textiles, music and theatre activities on offer primarily for those same disadvantaged young people for which The Roadmender was established in the first place. The Roadmender was the preeminent music/arts centre in Northamptonshire from the early 1980s to the late 1990s. The largest venue for touring bands between London and Birmingham, the Roadmender was an essential stop for the likes of Radiohead, Metallica, Oasis, Travis and the Manic Street Preachers until the refurbishment in 1999/2000 reduced the capacity of its main hall from 1000 to 850. Formerly a county council funded arts centre with a remit for arts, dance, live and recorded music; The Roadmender has had a varied history facing closure and bankruptcy several times during a long and complicated history. Its most recent closure occurred in late 2005 when it lost several hundred thousand pounds of council funding which forced its then owners Roadmender Ltd into liquidation. After several failed rescue attempts the brand and building were sold to Purplehaus, the owners of a nearby nightclub The Soundhaus, who rebranded it New Roadmender. Notable performances since its reopening have included Idlewild, The Maccabees, Marillion, Kate Nash, Biffy Clyro, Finch, We Are Scientists, Little Boots (supported by Ellie Goulding) , Deftones, Enter Shikari, Happy Mondays and the NME tour. Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour played the Roadmender on 18 December 2002.

It covered an area of , and its seat of government was the town of Geraldton. In existence for exactly four years, it was established on 1 July 2007 through the amalgamation of the former City of Geraldton and Shire of Greenough, and itself amalgamated with the Shire of Mullewa into the City of Greater Geraldton on 1 July 2011. History A recommendation was made to the Minister for Local Government by the Local Government Advisory Board in August 2006 to amalgamate the Shire of Greenough with the City of Geraldton. The Greenough electors successfully petitioned for a referendum to determine whether amalgamation should proceed. This was held on 2 December 2006, and with a participation rate of 28.74%, a majority of 80% voted against the proposal. However, under the Local Government Act 1995 (clause 10 of Schedule 2.1) as the vote did not attract 50% of registered voters, it did not meet the requirements for a valid poll. The councillors of both local government authorities resigned at the end of April 2007, and elections for the new local government took place in October 2007. The entity was managed by three commissioners in the interim, headed by Jeff Carr, who was the state member for Geraldton from 1974 until 1991. Throughout 2010 and 2011 negotiations were held between the City of Geraldton-Greenough and the Shire of Mullewa as to whether the two entities should merge. After a long period of negotiations the entities decided to merge. A poll was requested by both communities and was held on 16 April 2011. 83.24% of voters voted against the merger in Mullewa, with 72.39% of voters against the merger in Geraldton-Greenough. However, both polls failed to reach the minimum 50% turnout required to be a valid poll. The two entities will merge on 1 July 2011 to become the City of Greater Geraldton. Abolishment The Liberal government announced its intentions to amalgamate local governments around the state in line with reforms undertaken elsewhere in Australia. Ultimately, the plan did not succeed, but a number of local governments commenced negotiations for voluntary mergers. One such group included the City, the Shire of Chapman Valley and the Shire of Mullewa. In February 2010, Chapman Valley decided not to proceed, citing community opposition. In December 2010, the Local Government Advisory Board approved the merger. Polls were held in both municipalities, with 72.61% of voters in Geraldton-Greenough and 83.23% of voters in Mullewa voting against the merger.Western Australian Electoral Commission (16 April 2011). Mullewa and Geraldton-Greenough results. Accessed 26 July 2011. However, both polls failed to reach the minimum 50% required to be a valid poll, and the City of Greater Geraldton came into being on 1 July 2011. Wards The City was divided into six wards, each with two councillors.

Prelinger Library considers itself a \\"hybrid library\\" that blurs the distinction between digital and non-digital; as of 2009 it had over 3,700 e-books online. The library is unusual in that it uses a custom system of organization designed by Megan that intends to facilitate and emphasize browsing. For example, the section on \\"Suburbia\\" is next to the section on \\"Domestic Environments\\", then \\"Architecture\\", which becomes \\"Graphic Design\\", which in turn leads to \\"Typography\\" and \\"Fine Arts\\", and then \\"Advertising\\" and \\"Sales\\". There is no Dewey Decimal Classification system or card catalog. The library was inspired in part by the Warburg Institute Library in London, founded by German art historian Aby Warburg. His disciple Fritz Saxl wrote: \\"The overriding idea was that the books together--each containing its larger or smaller bit of information and being supplemented by its neighbors--should by their titles guide the student to perceive the essential forces of the human mind and its history.\\" Warburg built his library to find connections and relationships between antiquity and the Renaissance. Likewise, the Prelingers' library in part addresses the relationships among intellectual property, the evolution of media and cultural production. Prelinger is a \\"serendipity\\" library, a library that emphasizes the experience of browsing and discovering things that were formerly unknown. The library can also be seen as a counterbalance to modern public libraries, which, as part of digital-library initiatives, emphasize computers and databases and are no longer a \\"mere warehouse for books\\". Megan Prelinger said the library is \\"a local workshop, not an institution. We serve tea, and we encourage photography and scanning and any other form of non-destructive appropriation. That kind of environment is very natural to people in the millennial generation and people who have grown up during the resurgence of craft and DIY spaces.\\" The library is usually open one and one-half days a week, and hosts approximately 1,000 visitors per year.

History When it first opened its doors, in May 1914, there were only 22 students. This number rapidly grew and in 1916 the students of the mining school moved to a different location (the Mijnschool). Later on the school became known as the \\"Technische School\\", a name that still can be seen carved above the entrances. In 1995 the last students left the building.

Jouarre Abbey It is the site of the Jouarre Abbey, a Merovingian foundation of Abbess Theodochilde or Telchilde, traditionally in 630, inspired by the visit of Columban, the travelling Irish monk who inspired monastic institution-building in the early seventh century. At Jouarre, there was a community of monks as well as nuns, but all were under the rule of the abbess, who in 1225 was granted immunity from interference by the bishop of Meaux, answering only to the Pope. The Merovingian (pre- Romanesque) crypt beneath the Romanesque abbey church contains a number of burials in sarcophagi, notably that of Theodochilde's brother, Agilbert (died 680), carved with a tableau of the Last Judgment and Christ in Majesty, highlights of pre-Romanesque sculpture. In the mid-ninth century the abbey acquired relics of St. Potentien; the relics assembled at Jouarre attracted pilgrims. The reputation of the house stood so high the abbey received a visit from Pope Innocent II in 1131 and was able to house a synod in 1133. The abbess's submission to the bishop of Meaux did not come about until Bossuet held the post in 1690.Bossuet vs. Jouarre's Women The present convent buildings, once again occupied by Benedictine nuns, date from the eighteenth century; their traditional vegetable and fruit garden (potager) are notable.

Bookcover & p.1 At this time, Western was a lecturer in Psychology at the Australian National University. Their study comprised 250 voters who viewed the policy speech, examined the effect of this form of political communication, and traced its impact on the knowledge, attitudes, and opinions of this group. This was the first such detailed study undertaken in Australia, providing a testing of theories of cognitive equilibrium in relation to voting behaviour, and an examination of television's use in political communication. Western moved to the University of Queensland in 1966 and was appointed Professor of Sociology at the University of Queensland in 1970. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 1984. He specialised in the sociology of mass communication, class and inequality, and the professions in Australia.

In 1876 Georg Seebeck founded a small metal-processing workshop in Geestem√ºnde, a part of the city of Bremerhaven. In 1879 the first ship was constructed, a small steamer. In 1928 the Seebeckwerft became a member of the Deschimag, a cooperation of several German shipyards under the leadership of the Bremen-shipyard A.G. Weser. After WW II the Deschimag was dissolved and Seebeckwerft became subsidiary of A.G. Weser, now named A.G. Weser Seebeckwerft.

He was the first governor of Carpathian Ruthenia, the Rusyn autonomous province of Czechoslovakia and the only American who was a governor of any territory that was or became part of the Soviet Union. Early life and career He was born in the village of Galambos, Bereg County, Austria-Hungary (now Holubyne, Svaliava Raion, Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine) and emigrated to Pennsylvania with his parents at age five. His father, Paul Zhatkovich, was the founding editor of the leading Rusyn-American newspaper, Amerikansky Russky Viestnik. Zhatkovich graduated from high school in Pittsburgh, earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1907, and his LL.D. from the law school at Penn in 1910. Involvement in Rusyn Affairs 1918-1921 Following his father's involvement in Rusyn affairs, Zhatkovich was drawn in 1918 into the role of a spokesman for the American National Council of Uhro-Rusyns, at the time when the dissolution of Austria-Hungary placed their future - as that of many other peoples - on the international diplomatic agenda. In July 1918, Rusyn-Americans convened and called for complete independence of Carpathian Ruthenia. Failing that, they would try to unite with Galicia and Bukovyna; and failing that, they would demand autonomy, though they did not specify under which state. Gregory ≈Ωatkovich signing the Declaration of Common Aims at Independence Hall, Phila. PA 10-26-1918. Members of President Woodrow Wilson's administration told Zatkovich and other Rusyn- Americans that \\"the only viable option was unification with the new state of Czechoslovakia\\". Zatkovich accepted that the best he could do was work for creating a place for Rusyns in Czechoslovakia, and signed the \\"Philadelphia Agreement\\" with Czechoslovak President Tom√°≈° Masaryk, guaranteeing Rusyn autonomy upon unification with Czechoslovakia.PRECL√çK, Vratislav.

In May 1919, a Central National Council convened under Zatkovich and voted unanimously to accept the Czechoslovak solution. An assembly held in the territory itself on May 8, 1919 \\"Endorsed the decision of the American Uhro- Rusin Council to unite with the Czech-Slovak nation on the basis of full national autonomy.\\" Zatkovich was appointed governor of the province by Masaryk on April 20, 1920. He resigned, however, less than a year later, on April 17, 1921, to return to his law practice in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Gregory ≈Ωatkovich, Gov. of Ruthenia The declared reason for his resignation was dissatisfaction with the borders with Slovakia. p. 223 As noted, his tenure is a historical anomaly as the only American citizen ever acting as governor of a province that later became a part of the USSR. Death Zhatkovich died in Pittsburgh in 1967, aged 80, and was interred there at Calvary Cemetery. Publications * In fiction The third part of the novel \\"A Carpathian Rhapsody\\", by the Hungarian left-wing writer B√©la Ill√©s - whose plot takes place in Carpathian Ruthenia between the end of the 19th Century and the aftermath of World War I - is called \\"Gregory Zhatkovich's Kingdom\\". The highly partisan book presents Zhatkovich in a negative way, claiming that he was the dupe of American and French business and military interests, and that he had little control of or interest in the territory placed under his charge. The book also asserts that the imperial interests which placed Zhatkovich in charge were mainly interested in using the territory as a conduit for arms and ammunition to the anti-Soviet Polish forces fighting the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, than going on directly to the north, and that Zhatkovich had to resign after failing to stop local Communists from holding strikes as well as repeatedly sabotaging the railway line from Prague, through which the munitions were passing.

Several sources reported that the remains of the war heroes were lost. According to an early report, officials used bulldozers to demolish the memorial, leaving some of the remains on site. Several sources reported that the remains of the war heroes were lost. This was later proved to be not true. Among the reasons for the relocation the officials of Khimki cited the complaints about prostitutes hanging around at night. Another incentive for the removal of the graves was the need to widen the highway. The communist columnist, Anatoly Baranov, argued that it was the prostitutes who were to be lifted, not the veterans. On Sunday, April 22, a group of members of the Union of Communist Youth staged a protest at the site. The militsiya dispersed the meeting with force, as it was not sanctioned by the authorities. Several of those taking part were arrested; they later claimed to have been beaten and declared a hunger strike. The Khimki war memorial relocation incident was widely and not always appropriately used in relation to the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn controversy at the time. Reburial The reburial of war heroes on May 6, 2007. On 6 May 2007, the major TV channels of Russia showed the footage of the reburial of the exhumed remains at the Novoluzhinskoe cemetery, located in the centre of the city. The solemn ceremony was attended by about 1,000 people, including many veterans. An armoured carrier led the funerary procession. \\"The fallen heroes were remembered with a triple gun salvo from a Moscow Military District regiment.\\"  See also  * Khimki * Bronze Soldier of Tallinn References Category:World War II memorials in Russia Category:Soviet military memorials and cemeteries Category:Khimki ","title":"Khimki War Memorial"},{"id":"10963625","text":"Krystyna Czajkowska-Rawska (born 25 April 1936) is a former female Polish volleyball player, a member of Poland women's national volleyball team in 1955‚Äì1968, a bronze medalist of the Olympic Games (Tokyo 1964, Mexico 1968), a bronze medalist of the World Championship 1962 and medalist of the European Championship (silver in 1963 and 1967, bronze in 1958), eight-time Polish Champion, head coach.

There are congregations in Port Lincoln, Perth, Lock and Kingston, Tasmania. History The Free Presbyterian Church of Australia began in Port Lincoln under the ministry of Rev. Fred Buick on 1 January 1978 in the home of a Mrs. Elizabeth Feltus. Under the ministry of Rev. Buick and the subsequent lengthy ministry of Rev. Michael Patrick the church progressed and a permanent church building for the congregation was found and purchased. Another worship service was added, a weekly bible study and prayer meeting was established, and a Friday night youth work. In time the work extended northward to the small bush town of Lock, to Perth in Western Australia and to Tasmania. Doctrine The church is Presbyterian in doctrine and government, though it departs from the usual Presbyterian policy by recognising that baptism is variously understood by others equally committed to Scripture. It is Protestant in its faith, identifying with the Protestant Reformation. In theology the church is reformed. It sees itself standing in the tradition of John Calvin, John Knox, the Puritans and many revival preachers. The church is evangelistic, seeking to ‚Äúpreach the gospel to every creature‚Äù. Emphasis is placed upon the necessity of prayer in the life of the individual and church. Rowland Ward and Robert Humphreys suggest that \\"the doctrinal position is the Westminster Confession of Faith, but there are some concessions to baptist thinking in that the mode and subjects of baptism are left open questions.\\" Ward and Humphreys go on to note that \\"the pre-millennial view and the historicist interpretation of prophecy are standard. The King James Bible is exclusively used and recommended.\\"Rowland Ward and Robert Humphreys, Religious Bodies in Australia, 3rd edition (Wantirna, Victoria: New Melbourne Press, 1995), 95. The Book of Church Order for the Free Presbyterian Church of North America (a sister denomination) commenting on Free Presbyterianism in general, notes that ‚Äúon the issues as to whether the second coming of Christ will be pre-, post-, or a-millennial and whether, if it is premillennial, it will be pre-, mid-, or post- tribulational, there is liberty of opinion. This liberty does not extend to peculiar views of prophecy that weaken or contradict the exposition of the plan of salvation set forth in our confession and catechisms.‚Äù http://torontofpc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BCO2.pdf See also *List of Presbyterian and Reformed denominations in Australia References External links * Port Lincoln Congregation * Kingston, Tasmania Congregatione * Perth Congregation * Lock Congregation Category:Christian organizations established in 1978 Category:Presbyterian denominations in Australia Category:Presbyterian denominations established in the 20th century ","title":"Free Presbyterian Church (Australia)"},{"id":"10963666","text":"Jos√© Fern√°ndez may refer to:  Writers  *Jos√© Antonio Fern√°ndez de Castro (1887‚Äì1951), Cuban journalist and writer *Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez de Lizardi (1776‚Äì1827), Mexican writer and political journalist *Jos√© Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez (journalist) (born 1946), Mexican journalist Sport *Jos√© Fernandez (athlete), Paralympic athlete from Spain *Jose Fernandez (basketball) (born 1971), head women's basketball coach for the University of South Florida *Jos√© Fernandez (equestrian) (born 1947), Brazilian Olympic equestrian *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (middle-distance runner) (born 1933), Spanish Olympic athlete *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (racing driver) (born 1968), Australian racing driver *Jos√© Salgado Fern√°ndez (born 1989), Mexican boxer *Jos√© Fernandez (Panamianian boxer), Paralympic athlete from Spain, see Aaron Pryor  Baseball  *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (catcher) (1896‚Äì1972), Cuban-born baseball catcher and team manager, Negro Leagues career 1916‚Äì1950 *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (pitcher) (1992‚Äì2016), Cuban- American baseball pitcher *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (pitcher, born 1993), Dominican baseball pitcher *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (third baseman) (born 1974), Dominican Republic professional baseball player in the United States, Korea, and Japan *Jos√© Miguel Fern√°ndez (born 1988), Cuban-born baseball second baseman  Footballers *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (footballer, born 1939), member of Peru's 1970 FIFA World Cup squad *Jos√© Carlos Fern√°ndez Gonz√°lez (born 1971), Bolivian footballer *Jos√© Carlos Fern√°ndez (Peruvian footballer) (born 1983), Peruvian footballer for Argentinos Juniors *Jos√© Iglesias Fern√°ndez (1926‚Äì2007), Spanish footballer *Jos√© Luis Fern√°ndez (born 1987), Argentinian football midfielder *Jos√© Luis Fern√°ndez (born 1982), Perubian Ingeniero de sistemas *Jos√© Fern√°ndez (Chilean footballer) (1928‚Äì2009), Chilean footballer *Jos√© Alberto Fern√°ndez, Honduran footballer in 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup squads  Politicians  *Jos√© Agust√≠n Fern√°ndez, Paraguayan judge and human rights activist, found the \\"terror archives\\" *Jos√© Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez (born 1923), vice- president of the Cuban Council of Ministers *Jos√© F√©lix Fern√°ndez Estigarribia (born 1941), Paraguayan foreign minister, ambassador, senator *Jos√© Fern√°ndez Madrid (1789‚Äì1830), Colombian statesman, physician, scientist and writer *Jose W.

Though the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica states that because it \\"is essentially an intended device of revolution\\", it is therefore often published by the Communist Party or left wing sympathizers,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2013.

A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Criticism. (London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 703. This different emphasis may reflect a difference between Russian, American and other traditions of working-class writing, with that of Britain. The British tradition was not especially inspired by the Communist Party, but had its roots in the Chartist movement, and socialism, amongst others.Ian Hayward, Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to Trainspotting. (London: Northcote House, 1997), pp. 1-3 Furthermore, writing about the British working-class writers, H Gustav Klaus, in The Socialist Novel: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition (1982) suggested that \\"the once current [term] 'proletarian' is, internationally, on the retreat, while the competing concepts of 'working- class' and 'socialist' continue to command about equal adherence\\".Brighton: Harvest Press, 1982, p. 1. The word proletarian is also used to describe works about the working class by working-class authors, to distinguish them from works by middle-class authors such as Charles Dickens (Hard Times), John Steinbeck (The Grapes of Wrath), and Henry Green (Living).John Fordham, \\"'A Strange Field‚Äô: Region and Class in the Novels of Harold Heslop\\" in Intermodernism: Literary Culture in Mid-Twentieth-Century Britain, ed. Kristin Bluemel. Published 2009 :Edinburgh University Press, note no.1, p. 71. Similarly, though some of poet William Blake's (1757‚Äì1827) works are early examples of working-class literature, including the two \\"The Chimney Sweeper\\" poems, published in Songs of Innocence in 1789 and Songs of Experience in 1794, which deal with the subject of child labour,\\"William Blake Page\\", The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, & the Arts Blake, whose father was a tradesman, was not a proletarian writer.

(London: Penguin, 1999), pp. 704, 913 and socialist realism novel. The proletarian novel may comment on political events, systems and theories, and is frequently seen as an instrument to promote social reform or political revolution among the working classes. Proletarian literature is created especially by communist, socialist, and anarchist authors. It is about the lives of poor, and the period 1930 to 1945 in particular produced many such novels. However, there were works before and after these dates. In Britain the term working class literature, novel etc. is more generally used. The intention of the writers of proletarian literature is to lift the workers from the slums, by inspiring them to embrace the possibilities of social change or a political revolution. United States The most important American working- class writers gathered in the First American Writers Congress of 1935. The League of American Writers was backed by the Communist Party USA. Among the famous international writers who attended the Congress were Georg Fink (pseudonym of the German writer Kurt M√ºnzer), Mike Gold of New York (both of whom were Jewish), Jos√© Revueltas of Mexico, Nicomedes Guzm√°n of Chile, Jorge Icaza of Ecuador, and numerous others. In the United States, Mike Gold, author of Jews Without Money, was the first to promote proletarian literature in Max Eastman's magazine The Liberator and later in The New Masses. The Communist party newspaper, The Daily Worker also published some literature, as did numerous other magazines, including The Anvil, edited by Jack Conroy, Blast, and Partisan Review. Other examples of American proletarian writing include B. Traven, The Death Ship (1926) (though it is presumed that Traven was born in Germany); Agnes Smedley, Daughter of Earth (1929); Edward Dahlberg, Bottom Dogs (1929); Jack Conroy, The Disinherited (1933); James T. Farrell, Studs Lonigan (a trilogy, 1932-5); Robert Cantwell, The Land of Plenty (1934); Henry Roth, Call It Sleep (1934); Meridel Le Sueur, Salute to Spring (1940) and Tillie Olsen, Yonnondio (1930s, published 1974). Writers like John Steinbeck, Theodore Dreiser, and John Dos Passos, who wrote about the working class, but who came from more well-to-do backgrounds, are not included here. Soviet Russia An important movement In the first years of the Russian Revolution, Proletkult, was an effort to encourage literacy. This was something quite different from the later, traditional and realist proletarian novel of the Stalin years. In the 1930s Socialist realism became the predominant trend in Russia. Its leading figure was Maxim Gorky, who had laid the foundations of this style with his works The Mother and his play Enemies (both 1906). Gorky described the lives of people in the lowest strata and on the margins of society, revealing their hardships, humiliations, and brutalization. However, he did not come from a working-class family and neither did another prominent writer in the early years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, Alexander Ostrovsky.\\"Maxim Gorky\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maxim-GorkyRevyakin< A.I. A.N. Ostrovsky. Life and Works. Moscow, 1949, p. 7. However, Nikolay Ostrovsky is an important writer, of the early Soviet era, from a working-class family. His novel How the Steel Was Tempered (1932) has been among the most successful works of Russian literature, with tens of millions of copies printed in many languages around the world.http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e2008/e200804/p28.htmhttp://www.compuart.ru/article.aspx?id=8496&iid;=346 The book is a fictionalized autobiography of Ostrovsky's life, who had a difficult working-class childhood and became a Komsomol member in July 1919 and went to the front as a volunteer. The novel's protagonist, Pavel Korchagin, represented the \\"young hero\\" of Russian literature: he is dedicated to his political causes, which help him to overcome his tragedies.Soviet literature: problems and people K. Zelinsky, Progress Publishers. Moscow. 1970. p. 135. Leonid Leonov (1899 ‚Äî 1994) was a Soviet novelist and playwright. His novel The Russian Forest (1953) was acclaimed by the authorities as a model Soviet book on World War II and received the Lenin Prize, but its implication that the Soviet regime had cut down \\"the symbol of Old Russian culture\\" caused some nervousness, and Nikita Khrushchev reminded the author that \\"not all trees are useful ... from time to time the forest must be thinned.\\"James H. Billington, The Icon and the Axe: An Interpretive History of Russian Culture (Knopf, 1966), p. 28. Britain 19th century Robert Tressell banner Poet John Clare (1793‚Äì1864) was an important early British working-class writer. Clare was the son of a farm labourer, and came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation of its disruption.Geoffrey Summerfield, in introduction to John Clare: Selected Poems, Penguin Books 1990, pp 13‚Äì22. His poetry underwent a major re-evaluation in the late 20th century and he is now considered to be among the most important 19th-century poets.Sales, Roger (2002) John Clare: A Literary Life; Palgrave Macmillan . His biographer Jonathan Bate states that Clare was \\"the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self\\".Jonathan Bate, John Clare: A biography; Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 2003 A mid-Victorian example of a working-class novel is chartist Thomas Martin Wheeler's Sunshine and Shadows, which was serialized in the Northern Star 1849‚Äì50.Ian Haywood, Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to 'Trainspotting' . (Plymouth: Nortcote House, 1997), p7 Another chartist writer was the shoemaker poet Thomas Cooper, who, while in prison for making an inflammatory speech, \\"followed in the footsteps of Bunyan and other radicals and wrote imaginatively about the themes of oppression and emancipation\\".Ian Haywood, Working-Class Fiction, pp. 5-6. 20th century Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole (1933) has been described as an \\"excellent example\\" of an English proletarian novel.J. A Cuddon, p. 703. It was written during the early 1930s as a response to the crisis of unemployment, which was being felt locally, nationally, and internationally. It is set in Hanky Park, the industrial slum in Salford where Greenwood was born and brought up. The story begins around the time of the General Strike of 1926, but its main action takes place in 1931. Several working-class writers wrote about their experience of life in the merchant navy, including James Hanley, Jim Phelan, George Garrett, and John Sommerfield. Liverpool-Irish writer James Hanley wrote a number of works based on his experiences at sea as well as a member of a working-class seafaring family. An early example is the novella The Last Voyage (1931), in which stoker John Reilly, who is still working only because he lied about his age, now faces his last voyage.Stokes, p. 90. Although Reilly is in his mid-sixties he has a young family, who will have to live in future on his inadequate pension.Stokes, p. 16. In another sense this is Reilly's last voyage, because despairing of the future he throws himself into the ship's furnace: ‚ÄúSaw all his life illuminated in those flames. ‚ÄòNot much for us. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Sign on. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Finish. Ah, well!‚Äô‚ÄùPaul Binding, \\"Man Against Fate\\", a review of James Hanley's Last Voyage and Other Stories. Times Literary Supplement, 5 December 1997, p.21.Last Voyage and Other Stories (London: Harvill Press, 1997, p. 43. Among other works by Hanley are Boy (1931) and The Furys (1935). There were a number of Welsh writers who wrote works based on their experiences as coal miners, including novelist (and playwright) Jack Jones (1884‚Äì1970), novelists Gwyn Thomas (1913‚Äì1981). Lewis Jones (1897‚Äì1939), and Gwyn Jones (1907‚Äì1999), and poet Idris Davies (1905‚Äì53). Jack Jones was a miner's son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are Rhondda Roundabout (1935) and Bidden to the Feast (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of Cwmardy (1937), Lewis Jones's (1897‚Äì1939) largely autobiographical novel. Gwyn Thomas (1913‚Äì81) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to Oxford and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh, which appeared in 1946. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was Gwyn Jones (1907‚Äì1999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including Times Like These (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the 1926 miners' strike. The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in Idris Davies (1905‚Äì53), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh \\"but rebellion against chapel religion\\", along with the \\"inspirational influence of English\\" poets, led him to write in English. Gwalia Deserta (1938) is about the Great Depression, while the subject of The Angry Summer (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. Rhys Davies, author of A Time To Laugh (1937), and Menna Gallie, author of Strike for a Kingdom (1959) and The Small Mine (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of South Wales. Harold Heslop, author of the novel The Earth Beneath (1946) was another coal miner, but from the north-east of England, as was Sid Chaplin, who wrote The Thin Seam (1949). Both Alan Sillitoe, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1958) and Stan Barstow, A Kind of Loving (1960), were working class writers associated with the so-called Angry young men; they were also linked with Kitchen sink realism, a literary movement that used a style of social realism. This often depicted the domestic situations of working class Britons living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore social issues and political controversies. However, some of the writers also associated with these two movements, like John Osborne and John Braine, did not come from the working-class.\\"John Braine\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The following are some other important twentieth-century British working class novelists and novels: Robert Tressell, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists (1914); James C. Welsh, The Underworld (1920); Ethel Carnie Holdsworth, This Slavery (1925); Ellen Wilkinson, Clash (1929); Lewis Grassic Gibbon A Scots Quair (trilogy, 1932-4); Barry Hines, A Kestrel for a Knave (1968); William McIlvanney, Docherty (1975); Pat Barker, Union Street (1982); James Kelman, The Busconductor Hines (1984); Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting (1993).Ian Haywood, Working-Class Fiction, pp. 170‚Äì2. Edward Bond is an important working-class dramatist and his play Saved (1965) became one of the best known cause c√©l√®bres in 20th century British theatre history. Saved delves into the lives of a selection of South London working class youths suppressed ‚Äì as Bond would see it ‚Äì by a brutal economic system and unable to give their lives meaning, who drift eventually into barbarous mutual violence.Saved, Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by David Davis, London, Methuen Drama, 2008. France Two leading French writers who were born into the working class were Jean Giono (1895‚Äì1970) and Henry Poulaille (1896‚Äì1980). Jean Giono was the son of a cobbler and a laundry woman, who spent most of his life in Manosque, Alpes-de- Haute-Provence. He was a voracious reader but had to leave school at sixteen to work in a bank to help support his family. He published his first novel Colline in 1929, which won him the Prix Brentano and $1000, and an English translation of the book, he left the bank in 1930 to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis. The novels Giono published during the nineteen-thirties are set in Provence, with peasants as protagonists, and displaying a pantheistic view of nature. Marcel Pagnol based three of his films on Giono's work of this period: Regain, with Fernandel and music by Honegger, Ang√®le, and La Femme du boulanger, with Raimu. After World War II he planned on writing a sequence of ten novels inspired by Balzac‚Äôs La Com√©die humaine, in which he would depict characters from all strata of society rather than peasants, and contrast different moments in history by depicting the experiences of members of the same family a hundred years apart. But Giono only completed the four Hussard novels, Mort d‚Äôun personnage (1948)), Le Hussard sur le Toit (1951), Le Bonheur fou (1957), Angelo (1958). Henry Poulaille was the son of a carpenter and cane worker, who was orphaned at fourteen. In addition to writing novels Poulaille was active in encouraging working class writing in France from the 1930s.See for example: Burin Andr√© and Jean Rousselot, Dictionary of Contemporary French Literature. Paris: Larousse, 1966. See especially Michel Ragon, History of Proletarian Literature in France. Paris: Albin Michel, 1974. He is the author of numerous novels, essays on the cinema, literature, and popular traditions. Amongst the novels that he wrote are autobiographical works: There were four (1925); Daily Bread (1931); The Wretched of the Earth (1935); Soldier of Pain (1937); The Survivors: Soldier of Pain 2 (1938); Alone in life to 14 years (published posthumously in 1980). In these novels, based on his own life, Poulaiile depicts a working-class family, the Magneux.Michel Ragon, History of proletarian literature in France. Korea The proletarian literature movement in Korea was initially driven by the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 and the state of conditions that followed within the country. Proletarian literature acted as a movement that attempted to unify Korea against the shift into imperialism and capitalism that was brought forth by colonial Japan and its government that occupied Korea from the point of annexation until the end of World War II in 1945. The Korean proletarian literature movement became most prominent in the late 1920s and early 1930s, with the formation of multiple social and cultural groups that created, discussed, and revolved around proletarian arts. Works of Korean proletarian literature written before 1927 revolved around reconstructing and reforming social issues. One such example would be the short story \\"Starvation and Slaughter\\" (\\"Kia wa Saryuk\\", 1925) by author Ch'oe S≈è-hae, which detailed problems like discrimination between the wealthy and the poor classes. After 1927, Korean proletarian literature started to revolve around ideas that involved intellectuals rather than focus on the struggles between the rich and poor. Examples of these works include The Peasant ChoÀòng To-ryong by Yi Ki- yoÀòng, A Transitional Period by Han SoÀòr-ya, Rat Fire by SoÀòhwa, and Hometown by Kohyang. Cultural movements, especially those of left-wing politics, were fundamental in driving the proletarian genre and movement in Korea. Y≈èmgunsa, meaning Torch of the Masses, was a group and movement formed in 1922 that was led by the writer Song Y≈èng, and built on a focus towards literature pertaining to social issues and class politics. PASKYULA was a group that reacted to and discussed commonplace literature and art, with more of a focus on the cultural aspects of the materials. These groups were two largely important circles in the movement of unification that represented the mix of proletarian and bourgeois ideals that initially propelled the genre of proletarian literature in Japan-occupied Korea. Leader of Y≈èmgunsa, and a key author in KAPF's circle, Song Y≈èng primarily wrote with the intention of forming a solidarity within Korea as well as with Japan through his writing. Two works, \\"Our Love\\" in 1929, and \\"Shift Change\\" in 1930 highlight Y≈èng's ideology of unification within his writing, as well as the idea of moving away from cultural nostalgia and an idyllic past. In \\"Our Love\\", the process of industrialization and its resulting urban cities are portrayed as locales of potential opportunity rather than iniquitous environments, depicting a contrasting opinion to other works produced within KAPF. This is first shown through Yong-hee, a primary character within the story who eventually leaves the Korean countryside and travels to Tokyo, in pursuit of escaping her hometown's oppressive patriarchal culture and finding unity, independence, and equality in urban Japan's workforce. Set in Japan, \\"Shift Change\\" focuses more on the working class movement itself through a group of feuding Korean and Japanese workers. The resolution results in a reconciliation through combined effort, encouraging a combined effort from both the Japanese and Korean proletariat. During the Proletarian Movement, there was an urge from Japanese colonialists to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù Koreans away from communism. This conversion system was called choÀònhyang. ChoÀònhyang sparked numerous works from various authors such as The Mire by Han SoÀòr-ya, New Year‚Äôs Day by Yi KiyoÀòng, A Prospect by Paek Ch‚ÄôoÀòl, Barley by Kim Nam-ch‚ÄôoÀòn, and Management by Kim Nam-ch‚ÄôoÀòn, all published between the years 1939 and 1940. Japan The proletarian literature movement in Japan emerged from a trend in the latter half of the 1910s of literature about working conditions by authors who had experienced them, later called Taisho workers literature. Representative works from this period include Sukeo Miyajima's Miners (ÂùëÂ§´) and Karoku Miyachi's Tomiz≈ç the Vagrant (ÊîæÊµ™ËÄÖÂØåËîµ), as well as works dealing with military experiences which were also associated with the Taish≈ç democracy, the emergence of which allowed for the development of proletarian literature in Japan. In 1921, ≈åmi Komaki and Hirofumi Kaneko founded the literary magazine The Sowers (Á®ÆËíî„Åè‰∫∫), which aimed to reform both the current literary scene and society. The Sowers attracted attention for recording tragedies that occurred in the wake of the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. In 1924, Literary Front (ÊñáËä∏Êà¶Á∑ö) magazine was launched by Hatsunosuke Hirabayashi and Suekichi Aono, becoming the main magazine of the Japanese proletarian literature movement. New writing such as Yoshiki Hayama's The Prostitute (Ê∑´Â£≤Â©¶) and Denji Kuroshima's A Herd of Pigs (Ë±öÁæ§) also began to appear in the magazine. In 1928, the Japanese Proletarian Arts Federation (ÂÖ®Êó•Êú¨ÁÑ°Áî£ËÄÖËä∏Ë°ìÈÄ£Áõü, Nippona Artista Proleta Federacio, known as NAPF) was founded, bringing together the Japan Proletarian Artists Union (Êó•Êú¨„Éó„É≠„É¨„Çø„É™„Ç¢Ëä∏Ë°ìÈÄ£Áõü), the Labor-Farmers Artists Union (Âä¥Ëæ≤Ëä∏Ë°ìÂÆ∂ÈÄ£Áõü), and the Vanguard Artists Union (ÂâçË°õËä∏Ë°ìÂÆ∂ÂêåÁõü). NAPF was largely the responsibility of two up-and-coming writers called Takiji Kobayashi and Sunao Tokunaga, and the organization's newsletter Battleflag (Êà¶Êóó) published many influential works such as Kobayashi's The Crab Cannery Ship (ËüπÂ∑•Ëàπ) and March 15, 1928 (‰∏Ä‰πù‰∫åÂÖ´Âπ¥‰∏âÊúàÂçÅ‰∫îÊó•) and Tokunaga's A Street Without Sun (Â§™ÈôΩ„ÅÆ„Å™„ÅÑË°ó). Another important magazine was Reconstruction (ÊîπÈÄ†) which published writings from Ryunosuke Akutagawa and Yuriko Miyamoto, who had just returned from the Soviet Union. Other more renowned publishers like Ch≈´o K≈çron (Central Review), Kaiz≈ç (Reconstruction), and Miyako Shinbun also published works by proletarian authors, even those who were members of the Communist party. Author Korehito Kurehara traveled secretly to the Soviet Union in 1930 for the Profintern conference, and upon his return in 1931, he started agitating for the democratization of literary organizations. This sparked the drive to organize literary circles in factories and rural areas, creating a new source of readers and writers there. In 1931, the NAPF became the Union of Japanese Proletarian Cultural Organizations (Êó•Êú¨„Éó„É≠„É¨„Çø„É™„Ç¢ÊñáÂåñÈÄ£Áõü, Federacio de Proletaj Kultur Organizoj Japanaj, also known as KOPF), incorporating other cultural organizations, such as musicians and filmmakers. KOPF produced various magazines including Working Woman (ÂÉç„ÅèÂ©¶‰∫∫) The Japanese government cracked down harshly on proletarian authors, as the Japanese Communist Party had been outlawed since its founding in 1922. Though not all authors were associated with the party, the KOPF was, leading to mass arrests such as the March 15 incident. Some authors, such as Takiji Kobayashi were tortured to death by police, while others were forced to renounce their socialist beliefs. Kanik≈çsen (1929) is a short novel by Takiji Kobayashi (translated into English as The Cannery Boat (1933), The Factory Ship (1973) and The Crab Cannery Ship (2013)), which depicts the lives of Japanese crab fishermen. Told from a left- wing point of view, it is concerned with the hardships that the crew face and how they are exploited by the owners. The book has been made into a film and as manga. Romania Panait Istrati (1884‚Äì1935), was a Romanian working class writer, the son of the laundress and of a Greek smuggler. He studied in primary school for six years in Baldovine»ôti, after being held back twice. He then earned his living as an apprentice to a tavern-keeper, then as a pastry cook and peddler. In the meantime, he was a prolific reader.Roger Dadoun, Panait Istrati, L'Arc, Aix-en-Provence, 1983. Istrati's first attempts at writing date from around 1907 when he started sending pieces to the socialist periodicals in Romania, debuting with the article, Hotel Regina in Rom√¢nia Muncitoare. Here, he later published his first short stories, M√¢ntuitorul (\\"The Redeemer\\"), Calul lui BƒÉlan (\\"BƒÉlan's Horse\\"), Familia noastrƒÉ (\\"Our Family\\"), 1 Mai (\\"May Day\\"). He also contributed pieces to other leftist newspapers such as Diminea»õa, AdevƒÉrul, and Via»õa SocialƒÉ. In 1910, he was involved in organizing a strike in BrƒÉila. He went to Bucharest, Istanbul, Cairo, Naples, Paris (1913‚Äì1914), and Switzerland, where he settled for a while, trying to cure his tuberculosis). Istrati's travels were marked by two successive unhappy marriages, a brief return to Romania in 1915 when he tried to earn his living as a pig farmer, and long periods of vagabondage.√âdouard Raydon, Pana√Øt Istrati, vagabond de g√©nie, Les √âditions Municipales, Paris, 1968 In 1923 Istrati's story Kyra Kyralina (or Chira Chiralina) was published with a preface by the famous French novelist Romaine Rolland. It became the first in his Adrien Zograffi literary cycle. Rolland was fascinated with Istrati's adventurous life, urging him to write more and publishing parts of his work in Clart√©, the journal that Rolland and Henri Barbusse ran.Roger Dadoun. The next major work by Istrati was the novel Codine. Sweden In Sweden proletarian literature became known in the 1910s. Early pioneers were Dan Andersson and Martin Koch. Proletarian literature became widely known in the 1930s when a group of non-academic, self-taught writers like Ivar Lo- Johansson, Eyvind Johnson, Jan Frideg√•rd and Harry Martinson appeared writing about the working-class, often from the perspective of a young man.De svenska arbetarf√∂rfattarna Litteraturhistoria.se (in Swedish) Swedish proletarian literature is perhaps most closely associated with Ivar Lo-Johansson, who wrote about the lives of statare in his acclaimed novel Godnatt, jord (\\"Goodnight, earth\\", 1933) and in many short stories, collected in the books Statarna (1936‚Äì1937) and Jordprolet√§rerna (\\"Proletarians of the Earth\\", 1941). Jan Frideg√•rd also wrote about the lives of statare and is best known for a series of autobiographical novels beginning with Jag Lars H√•rd (\\"I Lars H√•rd\\", 1935). His first novel En natt i juli (\\"A night in July\\", 1933) is about a strike among statare, and depicts statare in a much rawer way than Lo- Johansson. Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson both later went on to write about other subjects and are mostly associated with proletarian literature by their highly acclaimed and widely read autobiographical novels published in the 1930s. Moa Martinson wrote about her own experiences of poor farm life as a wife and mother in several novels. Rudolf V√§rnlund depicted life in Stockholm from a proletarian perspective in several novels, and in 1932 his play Den heliga familjen (\\"The holy family\\") was the first play by a proletarian writer that was staged at the national Swedish theatre Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern.Den svenska litteraturen 1920-1950. Modernister och arbetardiktare, Bonniers 1989 Lars Ahlin debuted in 1944 with T√•bb med manifestet (\\"T√•bb with the manifest\\"), a novel about a young man looking for work and becoming politically aware. Many of the proletarian writers became prominent in Swedish literature. Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson were elected members of the Swedish Academy and shared the Nobel prize in literature in 1974. Proletarian literature in Scandinavia is also represented by writers such as the dane Martin Andersen Nex√∏, Norwegian Johan Falkberget and V√§in√∂ Linna from Finland. Australia Western Sydney is known for prominent industrial districts Australian authors who have contributed to proletarian literature have typically been affiliated with the Communist Party of Australia; Australian Labor Party or Australian Greens. Some prominent proletarian fiction authors include Frank Hardy (Power Without Glory) and David Ireland (The Unknown Industrial Prisoner about factory workers in Western Sydney).

L'Or√©e de L√©signy and Le Parc de L√©signy, Architectural project from a visionary entrepreneur William Levitt (1907‚Äì1994), born Jewish and originally from Russia and Austria, was an American real estate developer known as the founder of the modern American suburb, \\"suburbia\\". The 1920s was the beginning of commercial aviation. William's dreamed of becoming a pilot ... But the voice of reason naturally joined the family business: Levitt & Sons. Proponents of long standing, they have built their reputation by building high-class homes for the most part \\"on and around\\" of Long Island in New York. During the Second World War, William served as lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers of the U.S. Navy \\"SEABEE.\\" It leverages its expertise in testing a full-scale construction project necessary military barracks for the troops on the move in the Pacific. His \\"Service Record \\" note however, that William shine more ... by his attendance at the bar mess officer that his presence on the ground, but there is a man very close to his men, some would join after the war, the family business. After the war, William Levitt became aware of making available affordable housing for veterans. This is the beginning of \\"The American Way of Life\\". In 1947 he became the sole developer can build an entire city. \\"Levittown\\" in the state of New York is the first of many. His fame grew and he built up to 1968 more than 140,000 homes. In the mid-60, the developer decides to export its projects in Europe. He crossed the Atlantic and planted the American flag on French soil. The time is favorable. The state seeks to effect innovative projects corresponding to the needs of the population changing social, economic. \\"L'Oree de L√©signy\\" and \\"Le Parc de L√©signy\\" are his most famous. These programs are very daring for its time and culture, then give him the nickname \\"The De Gaulle of home building.\\" These French investments years are emotional. Indeed, a great lover of art works, he uses his trips to France to buy old master paintings (Degas, Matisse,...). On this occasion, he met Simone Korchin, a French art dealer for over 20 years his junior. He then falls in love: \\"I have no more space on my walls. I think I'm going to marry you! \\"... She became his third wife. Momentum, William Levitt sold his shares to ITT (International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation), while continuing to serve on the board. He became one of the richest men in the United States. And then came the 1970s with their oil crises and stock market. Investments lose over 90% of their values. The businessman tries to rebound in the amount of real estate programs, but will only be a result of failures. William Jaird LEVITT, \\"the man who built a house every 16 minutes,\\" ends, ironically, ruined in a hospital funded entirely by its charitable giving! In 1994, suffering from cancer and unable to pay his care, he died in the settlement total. In the early 1960s, France is a real home building site. Programs across vertical cities are mushrooming. These include housing developments available to families repatriated from Algeria after independence, known as ‚ÄúPieds Noirs‚Äù. But over time, these programs do not age well and are deserted. It should then propose something else. The evolution of habitat change in France. The first subdivisions appear ... Some dare to innovation by providing new models In 1968, L√©signy decides to leave his country purely through the initiation of neighborhood residential areas. William Levitt Jaird becomes the \\"pilot\\". And it is under the mandate of Jean Magne, then mayor of L√©signy, the joint becomes the reference of the \\"American Way of Life Made in France\\". In seven years, in our municipality, the population increased from 375 to 6567 people! L√©signy offers middle-class families visiting the \\"first model homes,\\" an original way of living, meeting the needs of a social class, with the characteristic elements of the North American suburbia. The product touted by American promoters, is indeed unique: a \\"private residence\\" with a \\"private garden, park in a giant house with a fitted kitchen with a refrigerator brand IGNIS, stove , of built-in wardrobes in each room, more restrooms, ... \\" For each of the residences, William Levitt establishes rules of common life and customs similar to Anglo-Saxon. It prohibits garden sheds ... visible signs of the proletariat, as drying clothes outdoors, growing vegetables and long-term parking of caravans. Unique, the residences are autonomous and sole owner of the roads and infrastructure. This set of rules makes the difference. For the first inhabitants of residences ‚ÄúL'Or√©e de L√©signy‚Äù and ‚ÄúLe Parc de L√©signy‚Äù, as the Americans of the previous century, live in a community subject to a strict building regulations, is not devoid of sense gratifying to play a pioneering new way of life and belonging to an elite included. Although these houses are adapted to living with the French living space and smaller roads, this is all for this time of a bold challenge to offer luxury goods at the time the price of a simple apartment! William Levitt certainly brings a different lifestyle but also innovative construction technologies. Indeed, at that time that could have bet on half-brick houses, half-wood, built with drywall partitions. Houses based on floor-reinforced concrete slab with no crawl space, directly on a compacted embankment and isolated? No more costly foundations. For the French builders of that time and developers, this project can only be doomed to failure. With an advertising campaign and the very powerful ‚Äúviva voce‚Äù, the operation is a success. They appeared in the early 1970s. First, is built \\"Le Parc\\" with its 600 homes on land up to 1000 m2, with a \\"recreation center\\" including a private swimming pool and tennis. A shopping center was created along the road, enlarged for the occasion. Then a second project of 276 homes being built, \\"L'Or√©e.\\" Originally the project \\"L'Or√©e de L√©signy\\" does not include the ‚ÄúRecreation Centre. Place Crecy, on the plans, gives access to individual houses instead of tennis courts and swimming pool. The remarks are potential buyers, however, change the project. The houses are disappearing in favor of a Recreational Centre offering a range of services similar to that of the residence of ‚ÄúLe Parc‚Äù. And surprisingly, the developer replaces the same sovereign right of the state, providing turnkey school two sets: a nursery school at the entrance of ‚ÄúL'Or√©e‚Äù has since become an associative complex city and a primary school in ‚ÄúLe Parc‚Äù, dedicated to the residents. While the suburbs South-East is less \\"chic\\" that the West of Paris but this program real estate near Orly airport and CDG airport future seduces a particular category of French airline staff. They are the same, a certain lifestyle with unfenced gardens \\"Open Garden\\" on the front of houses, garages included, such as covered porches, Louisiana. The entrance doors are carved and stained with the bell typical \\"proudly made in USA-OHIO- Dayton\\", all handles and locks are made of brass, all these attributes \\"made in USA\\" can be a great reminder rubbed in their long overseas stays. ¬´ L'Or√©e ¬ª and ¬´ Le Parc de L√©signy ¬ª are still the property complexes often cited as success stories in the textbooks of urban planning and architecture. The visionary spirit of William Levitt is always present, often imitated but never equaled. They evolve with the times, knowing that their half-American sisters, keep this inimitable character who made a reference that is their attraction. Of course, changes in our society and technology requires an adjustment in the application of such specifications must learn to evolve in our time. But philosophy and lifestyle of this piece of American Way of Life \\"made in France\\" must keep the essence of his initial success. And all residents must preserve this heritage.

North American came under severe criticism in 1965‚Äì66 by NASA's Apollo program director for cost overruns, delivery delays, and poor quality, and Storms was fired in 1967 in the aftermath of the Apollo 1 fire which killed three astronauts. Biography Early life and career Storms grew up in Chicago's North Shore (Wilmette), the son of a traveling salesman. As a boy, he was a member of the Boy Scouts and enjoyed building model airplanes. He attended Northwestern University, where he graduated at the top of his class and remained for a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. He then went to the California Institute of Technology to study for a second master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering under Theodore von K√°rm√°n.Gray, Angle of Attack, pp. 22‚Äì23. Storms became an employee of North American Aviation. In 1955, he successfully led North American's bid for the contract to design and build the X-15 airplane, and, two years later, he became Chief Engineer of North American's Los Angeles division. Apollo program In 1960, he was offered the opportunity to become head of North American's Missile Division, which at the time had only one contract: the AGM-28 Hound Dog missile. Storms was given the chance to lead North American's expansion into the business of spaceflight by Dutch Kindelberger and Lee Atwood. On September 11, 1961, North American won the contract for the S-II second stage of the Saturn V rocket. While this was a significant achievement, Storms was not satisfied, as he was also aiming for North American to win the contract for the Apollo spacecraft itself, which they did on November 28, 1961. Through the efforts of Storms' team and NAA Marketing VP Tom Dixon, Storms became known as \\"the father of Apollo\\" at NAA. In 1961, Storms' management team, called \\"the Storm Troopers\\", consisted of Harold Raynor, Dr. Robert Laidlaw, John Paup, Charlie Feltz, Bill Snelling, Dale Myers, Norm Ryker Jr., Scott Crossfield, Frank Compton, Lloyd Harriott, Dr. Henry Swift, Earl Blount, and Dr. Toby Freedman, Medical Director. Storms was named President of the newly formed Space and Information Systems Division. In the first six months of 1962, employment expanded from 7,000 employees to 14,000 employees.Gray, Angle of Attack, pp. 132. North American's development of the S-II and the Apollo spacecraft did not always go smoothly under Storms' management. NASA's Apollo program director Samuel C. Phillips headed a \\"tiger team\\" sent to NAA in late 1965 to investigate program delays and cost overruns, and sent a critical report documenting his findings and demanding corrective steps be taken, to his superiors and to Atwood in early 1966. Spacecraft CSM-011, used in the second unmanned suborbital test flight, was delivered to Cape Kennedy in 1966 with problems which delayed its flight by one month. Problems with the S-II and CSM-017 also delayed the first Saturn V test flight from late 1966 to November 1967. CSM-012, to be used in Apollo 1, the first manned flight, had even more problems with electrical wiring and ethylene glycol plumbing which delayed this flight as well, some of which contributed to a fire which killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee on January 27, 1967. After the fire, NASA Administrator James Webb demanded the resignation of either Atwood or Storms. Atwood decided to fire Storms.Storms interview with historian James Burke for BBC television \\"The Other Side of the Moon.\\" May 18, 1979. Storms never surfaced again in any capacity in Aerospace and died in obscurity. Storms' relationship with NASA's Apollo Spacecraft Program Office manager, Joseph Shea, was difficult at times. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties in the development of Apollo, Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. According to Storms, NASA had delayed in making key design decisions and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that Shea did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.Gray, Angle of Attack, pp. 184, 188. Shea became unfit for duty and was removed as ASPO manager, although not fired.Murray, Charles, & Cox, Catherine. Apollo: The Race to the Moon (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1989), pp. 213‚Äì14. In popular culture Screenwriter Mike Gray profiled Storms in his 1992 book, Angle of Attack. Publishers Weekly described it as a \\"swaggering portrait of NASA's Apollo project [which] might well be called Indiana Jones and the Engineering Mission of Destiny.\\"Barnes & Noble ‚Äî Books: Angle of Attack, by Mike Gray, Paperback, Reprint In the HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, Storms was played by James Rebhorn. In Stephen Baxter's alternate history novel Voyage, the character J. K. Lee is an amalgam of Storms and Tom Kelly. In the novel, Storms is a friend of the Lee character.

History The passing of the State Forests Act 1885 marked the beginning of regular reporting of forest management activities in Tasmania, conducted by Lands and Surveys Department until the formation of the Forestry Department in 1921. Research activities in the 1920s were mainly directed at assessing and mapping the State‚Äôs commercial timber resources. Ground mapping was eventually replaced in the 1930s and 1940s by vastly more eÔ¨Écient aerial mapping. As forestry resource modelling become increasingly sophisticated, the Forestry Department was replaced by the Forestry Commission in 1947 and the research eÔ¨Äort in all subject areas accelerated. The advent of the woodchip export industry in the 1970s gave rise to broad scale pulpwood harvesting. With a strengthened commercial focus, Forestry Tasmania was created in 1994, becoming a corporation under the Government Business Enterprises Act 1995. Rebranding and downsizing Following the release of the 2015/16 annual report and a loss of $67.4 million, the state government announced plans for the rebranding and restructuring of Forestry Tasmania. Changes include a downsizing and rebranding of the company to Sustainable Timber Tasmania, charging more for harvested timber, logging areas earmarked for reserves and for the government to pay more for forestry roads which have multiple uses. Former Forestry Tasmania logo (1994-2017) Sustainable Timber Tasmania commenced on 1 July 2017. A few months later it was announced that 29,000 hectares of hardwood forest plantations were to be sold for $60.7 million to Reliance Forest Fibre with a 99-year lease on the land. Permanent timber production zone land 'Permanent timber production zone land' (PTPZ or PTPZL) is crown land managed by Sustainable Timber Tasmania as defined in the Forest Management Act 2013. Crown land may be classified as PTPZ (or have PTPZ classification revoked) pursuant of approval by both Houses of Parliament. PTPZ land is primarily for the purposes of wood production; specifically, activities undertaken include native forest harvesting/reforestation, plantation harvesting, road and quarry construction. Access 'Permanent timber production zone land' is accessible to the public and normal road rules apply on the Forestry Tasmania managed roads. Roads may be closed for safety or forest operations. Camping is generally allowed except when signed ‚Äòno camping‚Äô. Protected areas A portion of the land managed by Sustainable Timber Tasmania has informal reserve status to protect habitat for threatened species, provide streamside protection, public recreation, etc. See also *Private Forests Tasmania - the statutory authority that provides assistance and advice on private forest management in Tasmania *Forestry in Tasmania *Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council References External links *Sustainable Timber Tasmania website Category:Government- owned companies of Tasmania Category:Tasmanian forests Category:Forestry agencies of country subdivisions Category:Forestry agencies in Australia ","title":"Sustainable Timber Tasmania"},{"id":"10964070","text":"James Blake Miller (born July 10, 1984) is a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, who fought in the Second Battle of Fallujah and was dubbed the \\"Marlboro Man\\" (and the \\"Marlboro Marine\\") after an iconic photograph of him with a cigarette was published in newspapers in the United States in 2004.Luis Sinco, Two lives blurred together by a photo, Los Angeles Times, November 11, 2007. Miller suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after the war. Early life Miller grew up in Jonancy, Kentucky. Miller's parents inspiration of his middle name was the show Dynasty, and both grandfathers served in the military with one serving in combat during the Vietnam War. He became an ordained minister. Not interested in working in the coal mines, Miller joined the United States Marine Corps, with the intention of eventually working in law enforcement. Iraq War Second Battle of Fallujah Miller was part of Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, a unit which took part in the Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004. Los Angeles Times photographer Luis Sinco took a photo of 20-year-old Miller leaning against a wall, smoking a cigarette. In explaining the photograph, Sinco said that \\"His expression caught my eye. To me, it said: terrified, exhausted, and glad just to be alive. I recognized that look because that's how I felt too.\\" Marlboro Marine Sinco's photograph of Miller was published in many newspapers. CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather singled out the photo for its excellence, and turned the then-unidentified Marine into a celebrity. Sinco was told to find the Marine for a follow-up story and tracked down Miller four days later in an auditorium near Fallujah's civic center. Miller was embarrassed about the photo's notoriety, but shared information with Sinco. The two would remain friends thereafter. After his identity was made public, people sent him care packages, including many cigarettes; President George W. Bush sent cigars, candy and memorabilia from the White House. The forward command center soon featured a large blowup of the photo. The Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division, Richard F. Natonski, made a special trip to see Miller, to Miller's surprise. The general shook Miller's hand and let him know that, because Americans had \\"connected\\" with his photo, and nobody wanted to see him wounded or dead, he was offered a trip home. Miller turned down the offer because he did not want to leave his comrades behind. The photo was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography in 2005. The photograph was nominated by Slate in 2011 for a list of \\"New Classics\\", products of the culture since 2000 that will withstand the test of time. Post-war After his tour, Miller returned to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. He was married in June 2005Luis Sinco, Rescue operation aims to save a wounded warrior, Los Angeles Times, November 12, 2007. and divorce papers were filed a year later.'Marlboro Man' Divorcing Wife After Dream Wedding, Los Angeles Times, June 27, 2006. He was deployed aboard the USS Iwo Jima, to assist recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina; during that period he blacked out during a PTSD episode. In November 2005, Miller was medically discharged from the Marine Corps. In 2008, Miller was living in his hometown and having difficulty receiving care from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. By 2013, he had reunited with his wife and, with the help of Sinco, has sought psychological help.

He went into banking and eventually served as a director of several companies, including the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Fidelity- Philadelphia Trust Company, the Baldwin Locomotive Company, and more. Before his election as university president, Gates had served for ten years as a Trustee of the University and as Chairman of the University of Pennsylvania Fund. Gates was heavily involved in plans for the development of the new Valley Forge campus for the University; however, the idea was eventually dropped in favor of expanding Penn's West Philadelphia campus, not before currying strong support.University Archives and Records Center University of Pennsylvania Thomas Sovereign Gates retrieved on 29 April 2007 He worked to fund and create a number of other facilities throughout the university. Gates also worked on major fundraising efforts with a campaign known as the Bicentennial Fund, after the University's 1940 bicentennial, which aimed to raise $12.5 million. Gates seemed to have partially foreseen America's involvement in the Second World War when creating a position of University Committee on National Defense and started a defense training program within the university's engineering school. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor Gates oversaw the use of the university campus as a training ground for American troops. He also worked to create a committee to oversee an overhaul of part-time courses and women's education systems. He worked to establish a College for Women by 1 July 1933 that would have the same curriculum as the current colleges. He created the Institute of State and Local Government in 1937, and the Fels Institute of the Wharton School in March of that year.

Two different meanings of \\"flush\\" \\"Flush deck\\" with \\"flush\\" in its generic meaning of \\"even or level; forming an unbroken plane\\", is sometimes applied to vessels, as in describing yachts lacking a raised pilothouse for instance. \\"Flush deck aircraft carrier\\" uses \\"flush deck\\" in this generic sense. \\"Flush deck\\" in its more specific maritime-architecture sense denotes (for instance) the flush deck destroyers described above: the flush decks are broken by masts, guns, funnels, and other structures and impediments, and are far from being unbroken planes. \\"Flush deck\\" in this sense only signifies that the main deck runs the length of the ship and does not end before the stem (with a separate raised forecastle deck forward) or before the stern (with a separate raised or, as seen on many modern warships, lowered quarterdeck rearward). History The British East India Company duplicated the flushed deck design of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for United Kingdom ships during the Industrial Revolution. The flushed deck design was introduced with rice ships built in Bengal Subah, Mughal India (modern Bangladesh), resulting in hulls that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of stepped deck design..

The population of the civil parish was 122 at the 2011 census. The village is located in a cul-de-sac. The church of St Peter and St Paul Governance The village is in South Northamptonshire, and is part of Blisworth and Roade ward. It is within the Northamptonshire County Council area. From the 2010 general election it is in the new parliamentary constituency of South Northamptonshire (previously Northampton South). Location The M1 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 passes to the northeast of the village, and junction 15 is just 1 mile distant. The main part of the village is on a no-through route. Courteenhall Parish has its own independent Parish Meeting which usually meets twice a year. It shares a rector with Roade, Ashton, Collingtree and Hartwell. Facilities The parish had a population of less than 100 in 2003, has no facilities other than a church and relies on the nearby village of Roade for shops, schools and other services. The post office in Courteenhall, which opened in 1883, closed in February 1996. History Church of St Peter and St Paul The church dates from the 12th century. It is now part of \\"The Five Parishes\\" group of local churches together with Roade, Collingtree, Ashton and Hartwell. The former Rectory is next to the south side of the church. The church has some memorable tombs. In 1851 a Church Attendance Census revealed that in Courteenhall, one of the three villages in the 'Three Parishes' church grouping (see links), out of a total population of 127, 100 people attended Courteenhall Church on census day, held in England on years ending in the digit '1'. Of course, particular 'circumstances' prevailed in the Victorian estate villages affecting individual behaviour. The Rectory next to the church dates from 1805. The Hall The village has grown up on the estate around the house or hall and known as the Courteenhall Estate, The landscaped park covers about , with formal gardens close to the house.Parks and Gardens UK - based on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest The estate was purchased from Richard Ouseley by Samuel Jones, the son of a London merchant, in 1647. Samuel was knighted in 1660, was High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1652‚Äì53 and died in 1673. His estates were inherited by his great-nephew Samuel Wake, a younger son of Sir William Wake, 3rd Baronet of Piddington. The Wake family is reputedly descended from Hereward the Wake, a Saxon hero of resistance to the Norman conquest of England. The park was designed in 1791 by Humphry Repton sic for Sir William Wake, 9th Baronet. The Hall, like the park, dates from 1791 on a site selected by Repton and is by a little-known architect Samuel Saxon. It is private property but may be viewed in the distance from Courteenhall village church. Although sheep graze over the grounds of the main park, they are kept out of the Hall's garden by a ha-ha. Courteenhall House is still occupied by the Wake family (Sir Hereward Wake, the 14th Baronet and Lady Julia. Their son Hereward Charles lives on the estate in the stable block). The Stables and School House The hall from the church Built around 1750 in the Palladian style and contrast with the house. There is also in the grounds the former Free Grammar School House of about 1680, under the will of Sir Samuel Jones containing its original school furnishings including a raised seat for the school master. Visitors The venue is rarely open to the public but is available for private hire. It is at the end of a narrow cul-de-sac road and has very limited parking. Visitors are advised to park outside the village and use one of the many public footpaths for access. Parking during the f√™te is via the main drive from the A508 Northampton to Milton Keynes road only. Biennial f√™te A large biennial f√™te is held during June in even-numbered years, which is an opportunity to see the house (exterior only), and grounds including an extensive arboretum. The event raises several thousand pounds for the upkeep of the church, parts of which are over 800 years old.

It is a full-scale interpretation of the biblical Ark, featuring animal models, including cows, penguins, a crocodile, and a giraffe. It opened to the public in 2012.  Construction  Huibers built his ark with eight helpers in four years. It is divided in seven stories. The wooden construction is carried on a hidden floating platform from steel made up of 21 LASH barges. Previously the LASH barges were cargo containers, towed or pushed as floating barges over inland waterways, while carried on large ships over rough seas. Hence the ark can be towed by tugboats over the rivers, but it is not seaworthy. It could travel the seas on top of a pontoon or transport ship.Foxnews, may 2016 The wood volume is equivalent to 12000 trees. While the Bible specified that the Ark had to be built from the unknown gopher wood, this ark is made of American Cedar and Pine. The ark is long, wide, and high. The cost of building it was 4 million euros. Half-scale version Earlier half-scale version A few years earlier Huibers built a half-scale interpretation of the Ark, in the river port of Schagen, 50 km north of Amsterdam. Huibers did the work mostly with his own hands, using modern tools and occasional help from his son, in one and a half years. Its size, adapted for sailing the Dutch canals and locks, was long, wide, and high.Website of Johan's Ark The cost to build was 1 million euro. In 2007 Huibers opened the doors to visitors. After a few months the vessel was towed by tugboat through the canals and moored in 21 harbors in the Netherlands. The ark was sold to Dutch artist Aad Peters in 2010. He tours through Germany, Denmark and Norway. Although the ark isn't really seaworthy and can't handle waves higher than two meters, it was successfully towed across the sea from Denmark to Norway.Siren L√∏kaas 2015 On 10 June 2016, the ark collided with a moored vessel (NoCGV Nornen) while under tow in Oslo harbor. The ark suffered severe damage to its wooden cladding. Visit to Ipswich In November 2019 Aad Peters brought the Ark to Ipswich, Suffolk. He explained that this was because of Brexit. He explained that he felt that the story of the Judgment of Solomon was important when faced with the sort of social division such as experienced around Brexit.

The landmarked and completely preserved estate was used by the National Socialists between 1936 and 1939 as an educational centre for future leaders. Since 1 January 2006 the area has been open to visitors. It is one of the largest architectural relics of National Socialism. The gross area of the landmarked buildings is 50,000 m2. History The Watertower of the Ordensburg (48 m height)  Planning and construction since 1933  In a 1933 speech in Bernau near Berlin, Adolf Hitler demanded that new schools be built for the children of the leaders of his national socialist German labour party (NSDAP). The task was given to Robert Ley, the \\"Reichsorganisationsleiter\\" (literally: Reich Organisational Leader) of the NSDAP, who undertook the construction and operation of four educational camps (NS-Ordensburgen): *Ordensburg Kr√∂ssinsee, in Pomerania *Ordensburg Sonthofen, Allg√§u *Ordensburg Vogelsang, Eifel A fourth one was planned at (the historic) Ordensburg Marienburg, in West Prussia. The construction of Ordensburg Vogelsang, most of which lies within the district of the town of Schleiden, was financed by expropriating trade unions and employers' associations. The contract for planning the Kr√∂ssinsee and Vogelsang projects went to the Cologne architect Clemens Klotz. The three buildings at Eifel have been known as \\"NS-Ordensburg\\" since 1935. The first phase of the project was the construction of the Castle of Vogelsang, which with up to 1,500 workers took only two years. Several much bigger buildings were also planned, such as a huge library to be called the \\"House of Knowledge\\" (Haus des Wissens) measuring 100 metres by 300 metres, a \\"Kraft durch Freude\\" hotel with 2000 beds, and the biggest sports facilities in Europe. Construction at the site halted on the outbreak of war. Overview of the buildings *the entry area with gate and two towers (almost completed) *the \\"House of Knowledge\\" (Haus des Wissens) (only the foundation walls completed) *the \\"Community House\\" (Gemeinschaftshaus) with \\"Adlerhof\\" (literally translated: \\"eagle's yard\\"), tower, east wing and west wing (completed, partly destroyed in the war) *ten \\"Kameradschaftsh√§user\\" (literally translated: comradeship-houses) for 50 pupils each (completed, partly destroyed in the war) *four \\"Hundertschafth√§user\\" (literally translated: houses of group of one hundred) for 100 pupils each (completed) *the Thingplatz as event stage (completed) *sports facilities with tribune, gymnasium and indoor swimming pool (completed) *the torch bearer (Feuermal Fackeltr√§ger) (completed) *the \\"House of female employees\\" (completed) Image:Vogpanor.jpgEntrance area of the castle Image:Voginnen.jpgInner courtyard of the castle Image:Vogwanha.jpgLobby (Wandelhalle) Image:Vogthing.jpgThingplatz  Art  Most of the sculptures in Vogelsang - \\"Fackeltr√§ger\\" (torch bearer), \\"Der deutsche Mensch\\" (The German Man), \\"Adler\\" (Eagle) and the \\"Sportlerrelief\\" (sportsmen-relief) - were created by Willy Meller. The wood-sculpture \\"Der deutsche Mensch\\" disappeared in 1945. The other sculptures have been preserved, but are partly damaged. After a visit by Adolf Hitler in 1937, Doric pillars without any static function were added to the entrance gate. According to reports, the initiative for that came from Hitler himself.

Most were in their mid twenties, and entrance requirements included a period of probationary party work, perfect physical health, proof of descent, and proof of work and military service.

Another emphasis was pilot training, and to accommodate this phase of the curriculum airfields were built at all three Ordensburgen. The Vogelsang Airfield was built near Walberhof, near the town of Schleiden-Morsbach. The Ordensburg Vogelsang was also used as a showplace for political notables.

During the interim, Vogelsang hosted a couple of classes of the so-called Adolf-Hitler-Schools. In 1944, a military fitness camp for 15- and 16-year-old members of the Hitler Youth (Hitler-Jugend) was held there. Allied air raids destroyed some of the buildings, including the east wing and the gymnasium.  Use as a military training area since 1946  Vogelsang Military Training Area The buildings destroyed during the war were reconstructed by the Belgian military authorities, and the surviving structures‚Äîreduced to bare brickwork‚Äîacquired a practical use. The foundation walls constructed for the House of Knowledge (Haus des Wissens) were used for the Van Dooren barrack block, and the adjacent basement, originally intended for an auditorium, became a cinema. This cinema has room for an audience of over 200. Of the decorations, only the emblems of the Third Reich‚Äîthe swastikas‚Äîwere removed.  Civil use since 2006  After its period as a military training area came to an end, the former Ordensburg has been open to civilians since 1 January 2006. It can be visited during daytime. The surrounding area is used for hiking trails. The complex will eventually accommodate the administration of the National Park Eifel, the visitor centre, and an exhibition in the Castle. The \\"Van Dooren\\" barracks block will be demolished soon because the accommodations are no longer needed. The cinema and all the other buildings still exist. In 2016 the German government said it would use some of the Vogelsang Barracks blocks to house migrant refugee claimants. The latest stage of a ¬£40 million facelift is the opening of an exhibition, aiming to educate the young against fascism. The display depicts how ordinary men and women were conditioned by the Nazis to hate Jews and others branded as inferiors.http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/third- reich-school-becomes-a-tourist-attraction-96hh7gm6g  Literature  View from the Urfttal dam * Schmitz-Ehmke, Ruth: Die Ordensburg Vogelsang: Architektur ‚Äì Bauplastik ‚Äì Ausstattung.

Life and work  Trouton was born in Dublin on 24 November 1863, the youngest son of the wealthy and prominent Thomas Trouton. He attended Royal School Dungannon and went on to Trinity College, Dublin in 1884, where he studied engineering and physical science. While still an undergraduate student, Trouton observed a relationship between boiling points and energies of vaporisations, which he presented in two short papers. He found the change of entropy per mole for vaporisation at a boiling point is constant, or expressed mathematically ŒîSm,vap = 10.5 R (where R is the ideal gas constant). This became known as Trouton's rule and, despite having some exceptions, is used to estimate the enthalpy of vaporisation of liquids whose boiling points are known. Trouton himself belittled his discovery as it was merely the result of an afternoon's manipulation of data from a book of tables. Before graduating he also took a leading role in surveying for a railway. Trouton graduated Master of Arts and Doctor of Science in 1884, and was immediately appointed assistant to the professor of experimental physics, George FitzGerald. They collaborated on many experiments and became good friends; FitzGerald's influence can be seen in a lot of Trouton's earlier work. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1897. His application citation read: \\"Discovered the law connecting the extent head of vaporisation and molecular weights of bodies known as \\"Trouton's law\\" and experimentally determined the directions of vibration of electric and inaquatic force in plane polarised light. He has made other important observations on the phase of secondary waves and on the influence of the size of the reflector in Hertz's equipment.\\" A 1902 appointment as Quain Professor of Physics at University College London led to a 12-year career of experimental physics, including work on the Trouton-Rankine experiment. He received an OBE in 1918. Trouton married Anne Maria Fowler in 1887 and they had four sons and three daughters. Their first two sons, Eric and Desmond, were killed in World War I. He was severely ill in 1912, and an operation in 1914 left him paralysed in the lower limbs and caused his retirement. Despite this, he retained the wit and charm he was known for. After retiring, Trouton lived in Tilford, Surrey, and then Downe in Kent where he died on 21 September 1922.

Since 1997 it has been part of the Meyer Neptun Group together with Meyer Werft in Papenburg. History The company was founded as the \\"Schiffswerft und Maschinenfabrik von Wilhelm Zeltz und Albrecht Tischbein\\" in 1850 and their first iron steamship was launched in 1851. The shipyard developed quickly, and as early as in 1857 it had some 400 employees. In 1890, after several mergers and buyouts, it became the \\"Actien- Gesellschaft Neptun\\". After 1945 and the division of Germany, the shipyard focused on markets in Eastern Europe. At that time the \\"Schiffswerft Neptun Rostock\\" counted among the most renowned state-owned shipyards of the German Democratic Republic. The changing conditions of international competition following the German reunification brought about a time of change for the company. Productivity was not up to international standards, and due to EU restrictions it was no longer allowed to build new sea-going vessels. The yard became \\"Neptun Industrie Rostock\\" (NIR), and the following years were heavily influenced by staff cuts, re-organisation and diversification. Focus was put on the repair and upgrading of ships, construction and delivery of ship components, steel constructions for hydraulic engineering and complex Ro-Ro facilities. In 1997 Neptun Werft became part of the Meyer Neptun Group, which includes Meyer Werft in Papenburg. Neptun Werft has geared its activities to its core maritime sector, while many companies formerly belonging to NIR and dealing in different sectors were sold, or set up independent operations. Since the year 2000 the shipyard's activities have been centred on the premises in Warnem√ºnde (a district of Rostock), and the construction of river cruise vessels has been included in the product range. New production halls were erected in 2003 which allow ship construction independent of weather conditions.

It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Panetolikos. The stadium is located at Prousiotissis Street and it holds a capacity of 6,288 all-seated. Its highest attendance was 11,012 during a match against Olympiakos in 1977. There are plans to increase the seating capacity of the stadium to 11,000 in the future if necessary. Nowadays the average attendance is 5,000 (6,288 after expansion completion). Even though Agrinio is small city, Panetolikos supporters known as \\"The Warriors\\" are well known for their loyalty for the team. Info The stadium has two stands along the sides of the pitch. It has been used as a football ground since 1930, however the first stand (the small east one) was not constructed until the mid-'50s. The main west stand was built in the 1970s. Unfortunately, in the years that followed, little else happened to the stadium, which gradually fell into disrepair. This was the situation until 2005, when the new owners of the club revealed their plans for the complete reconstruction of the stadium. The stadium features also team's offices, boutique and cafes. Work has begun after the promotion of the team to the Superleague division, in order to increase the capacity of the stadium by 1400 seats approximately behind Prousiotissis Street goalpost (a Curva). Thus the Panetolikos' pitch will have three stands. Additional lighting and a scoreboard will be added over the next months. Recently the addition of extra lighting was complete, with the overall power of lights at 1600 lux, which satisfy the Greek Superleague and UEFA requirements.

His story strikes remarkable similarities with Klaus Bargsten of . After his capture, Franz agreed to help the United States Navy observe behaviour characteristics of fellow German P.O.W.s. Early life Machon was born in Kattowitz (Katowice) to John and Anna Machon, two Polish commoners. In his early years he worked as a streetcar conductor while attending school. He married a woman named Mary Munik (Maria Munik) who gave birth to a son (his son was 15 months old when he was captured). After the Nazi invasion of Poland, Machon found himself drafted into the Pioneer Corp. He later requested to be transferred to the Kriegsmarine in Hamburg for submarine training.  U-512  Sinking On October 2, 1942 several hundred kilometers north of Cayenne (in position ) was intercepted by depth charges from an American Douglas B-18 Bolo of the 99th Bomb Squadron. The German U-boat quickly filled with water, and left the entire crew panicking in fear. Soon, the entire cabin was filled with chlorine gas and the crewmen began to cough. (It was guessed that the chlorine gas was produced from the batteries of electric torpedoes.) A short time previously it had been discovered that the escape lungs had been improperly stowed and that the majority of them had become wet from a buildup of condensation in the boat. Soon, air pressure in the compartment began to mount and speech became very difficult. Men were beginning to collapse rapidly from the combined effects of chlorine and high pressure. Others were starting to bleed from their mouth and from their ears in agony. In the next several minutes, tragedy would claim all 51 crewmen except for one, Machon. He and a boatswain's mate decided to attempt to open the torpedo loading hatch rather than die from the gas. Because his crewmate had no snorkel, he let him go first and quickly followed. After exiting the boat, his crewmate got confused with the direction to the surface and swam horizontally, only to lose himself between the hull and the superstructure. Upon reaching the surface, Machon swam around for roughly 1.5 hours unsuccessfully looking for his partner until an inflated life-jacket was dropped to him from a circling airplane from the 99th bombing squadron. This was soon followed by a drop of a thermos outfitted with water, a signal pistol, paddles and about of rope. The Raft The raft provided by the aircraft was his only form of shelter for the next 10 days. Several times, Franz unsuccessfully attempted to attract the attention of various tankers and passing aircraft by firing his signal pistol. In order to escape the heat he would usually swim in the water during midday. On the ninth day at sea he was attacked by seabirds which pecked him on the shoulders so violently he was left with permanent scars. He managed to capture two of the birds, which he split and dried in the sun. Later, with his provisions running low, he decided to eat them, complaining slightly of their fishy taste to his interrogator. Machon, now helpless and facing the verge of death, etched his name into the paddle so that his body could be identified. The day following he was rescued by the United States destroyer, at position on 12 October 1942. Interrogation  When Machon was rescued, the interrogators gave some time for him to recover his health. When he was found, he was severely sunburned and emaciated. On October 19, 1942 he was formally interrogated. At first he was very nervous giving details to the Navy officials, but then opened up after realizing Nazi propaganda about Allied torture was false in P.O.W. interrogation methods. During his stay he helped Navy officials gather intelligence data on other prisoners, and was extremely co-operative to his captors. After being relieved from his duties, he stayed at Fort Hunt until his release. Release On April 16, 1945 he was handed to the Polish authorities. He then settled with his wife and child in Wirek, Poland. Today, not much is known about Machon except for his miraculous story detailed in his interrogation on the Ellis. Since his release in 1945, no word from him or his family has surfaced yet. If he is still alive today, then his whereabouts are unknown.

He was played by two actors. Robert Cuthill played him from July 2001 through October 2001. The role was then taken over by Justin Melvey who played him from October 2001 until January 2003 and in October 2004. Fictional character history  Colin is the cousin of the Bradys and the mysterious doctor that Jennifer Horton met in Africa and fell for. Jennifer followed him to Ireland but he brushed her off. He first came to live in Salem with his fianc√© Elizabeth Cox while he worked at the hospital. Bo suspected Colin was trouble when he learned Colin came from Ireland. Although Jennifer heard Colin was in town, they didn't meet until the Mother of the Year party Lexie threw for Hope at the DiMera Mansion. Eventually, Colin and Elizabeth went to Las Vegas to be married. When Elizabeth overheard a phone conversation in which he stated the only reason he was going to marry her was for her money, she called it off and went back to England. Not long after that, Colin wanted to get back together with Jennifer but she was dating Brandon Walker as well as being pursued by her ex-husband Jack Deveraux. Colin began a relationship with Nicole Walker in order to make Jennifer jealous but was unsuccessful. Later, he reunited with Nicole but was warned by Victor Kiriakis to stay away from her. At that same time, Andr√© DiMera (disguised at Tony DiMera) came back to Salem. Colin was the doctor that secretly treated Andr√©'s blood disease. When Jack started to suspect there was a connection between Colin and Andr√©, Jennifer decided to start dating Colin to find out if he was working for the DiMeras. When Stefano died, Colin was at the reading of the will. Not long after that, he got a silver bullet with Bo Brady's name engraved on it. In addition to Andr√© DiMera, Colin was also Chloe Lane's doctor after she was diagnosed with cancer. He also operated on Nicole after she was shot by an assassin working for Stefano. Colin broke into the hospital basement where Cassie and Rex were being held. Later on, Colin started to blackmail several inhabitants of Salem: Sami Brady for switching Lexie's DNA test results for her baby, and Nicole Walker with a tape of them having sex after she was engaged to Victor. After Larry Welch was \\"killed\\" by Bo Brady, Colin started getting mysterious phone calls. Larry Welch was alive and was now blackmailing Colin to kill his own cousin, Bo. Later Jennifer was spying on a meeting between Andr√© and Colin where they discussed how to enhance the DiMera empire. When Andr√© and Colin left the room she tried to get out but Colin caught her. She was forced to sleep with him in order to keep her cover. Later on, she told to Bo and Jack what she discovered. When Jennifer and Jack were getting together again, Colin wanted Sami to lure Jack out so he could kill him. Instead, Sami told Andr√©. At the night of Victor's wedding, Colin was ordered by Larry Welch to kill Bo Brady. When Colin was waiting outside and aiming at Bo, Shawn-Douglas Brady saw him and began fighting Colin. The gun accidentally went off, injuring Colin. Colin escaped, but not far. He ran into Nicole, who told him she would kill him if he did not stop blackmailing her. When he made an attempt to get the gun away from Nicole but it fired and killed him. The body was later found by Belle Black. Nobody knew who killed Colin. Not long after the event transpired, his ghost started haunting several of the suspects of his murder. Victor found out it was Nicole and that Colin was blackmailing her with the tape. Later, Nicole and Brady Black went to Melaswen, a.k.a. New Salem, in order to prove Nicole was innocent. They found Colin Murphy was alive but being held captive and tortured by Bart Beiderbecke and Andr√© DiMera. They rescued him and found the rest of the prisoners. Colin told them that this was all planned years in advance, even before Andr√© entered Salem. He said everyone who was killed was actually being drugged and pronounced dead by a doctor working for the DiMeras at the hospital. He also said that Andr√© wanted him to be the doctor on the inside, but when Colin refused, Andr√© drugged and \\"murdered\\" him like the rest. Colin told Nicole and Brady he would give the names of everyone involved when they got back to Salem but when they were about to escape, Andr√© and his men arrived and dragged Colin away. Colin was the only casualty of the Melaswen storyline. While leaving the island during a storm, he was lost at sea and assumed to have drowned.

It first appeared in the Ibanez product line as of the 1986 model year; however, they have appeared on guitars with 1985 serial numbers. The Edge offers a number of improvements from the Original Floyd Rose, namely locking studs (for improved tuning stability, added in 1987-8), a spring retainer on the tremolo block (again, added in 1987-8) and a pop-in arm. A non-locking version, Edge II, appeared on the Vinnie Moore signature guitar in 1989. The guitar employed a low-friction nut and locking tuners. The Edge enjoyed massive success in the late Eighties and is still the tremolo of choice for players such as Steve Vai and Joe Satriani. Tom Morello has also been known to install these tremolos in his non-Ibanez guitars. In 2003, the patent for the Original Floyd Rose tremolo expired. This coincided with the release of a newly designed pair of Tremolos from Ibanez, the Edge Pro and the Edge Pro II. Ibanez mistakenly figured that all the Floyd Rose patents were available for use; however, the patent on the Low Profile design was still in effect. This prompted the Edge Pro II's replacement with Edge III which fits into the parameters of the original patent and is therefore not subject to a license fee. The Edge Pro and Edge Pro II differ from the original Edge, as they are able to accept strings with the ball-ends still attached, and have no locking studs. Due to the lack of locking studs, the tremolo is in some ways inferior to the models it replaces; however, the lower profile design and ergonomic improvements mean this distinction is not clear cut. The Original and Lo-Pro Edge are still produced and are available through Ibanez Parts dealers. Positioned as top of the line locking tremolo systems, the Original and Lo-Pro Edge are among the most expensive pieces of guitar hardware in mass production, with a unit cost higher than the Floyd Rose Original and the Schaller Floyd Rose, and indeed more expensive than even a number of Ibanez guitars (including ones with lower-tier locking tremolos). The Original Edge is still being used by Ibanez for certain RG series reissues, and all 2010 Ibanez JEM and JS series guitars.

The house was built in 1867 in a mix of nineteenth-century architectural styles including Dutch neo- renaissance, Scottish baronial, Queen Anne, and Romanesque Revival. It is now operated as a house museum and is open late May until late October for an admission fee.  History  The house was built by Vermont-born John Johnson, a physician, and his English wife. Planning and construction of the house lasted for nearly eight years, and cost $1,300,000. Johnson met his wife in England while studying medicine, and he employed at least two English architects in the design of the house and its eighteen outbuildings. The Johnsons remained in the house only briefly. The castle was repossessed when Mrs. Johnson died, and Dr. Johnson was unable to afford taxes or maintenance. Antiques and valuables were auctioned off or taken by unpaid employees and locals began to call the castle \\"Johnson's Folly.\\" From the 1880s until 1939, the property changed hands four times. In 1939, Herbert Lee Wilson, a pioneer in the AM radio field, purchased the estate and created radio station WHWB-AM in its stable. Wilson joined the United States Army Signal Corps during the Second World War, and retired in the 1950s with the rank of colonel. He died in 1981 and left the estate to his daughter, who died in 2009. Five generations of the Wilson family have lived at the house since 1939. The house has been open for tours since 1962.  Characteristics  Set on of grounds, the house contains 32 rooms on 3 stories. Its facade is built of English brick and French marble in a fanciful architecture with 19 proscenium arches, 84 stained glass windows, 2 turrets, parapet, and balcony. Its interior includes 13 fireplaces finished with imported tiles and bronze. Furnishings include Asian and European antiques, statuary, Chinese scrolls, and oriental rugs.

The IBSA Dialogue Forum (India, Brazil, South Africa) is an international tripartite grouping for promoting international cooperation among these countries. It represents three important poles for galvanizing South-South cooperation and greater understanding between three important continents of the developing world namely, Africa, Asia and South America. The forum provides the three countries with a platform to engage in discussions for cooperation in the field of agriculture, trade, culture, and defence among others. The IBSA Dialogue Forum plays an increasingly important role in the foreign policies of India, Brazil and South Africa. It has become instrumental for promoting ever closer coordination on global issues between three large multicultural and multiracial democracies of Asia, South America and Africa, and contributed to enhancing trilateral India- Brazil-South Africa cooperation in sectoral areas. Origin After the co- operation between India (South Asia), Brazil (South America) and South Africa. The Declaration at the trilateral meeting in Brasilia, called for removing protectionist policies and trade distorting practices by improving the multilateral trade system. On 6 June 2003, Yashwant Sinha (External affairs minister of India), Celso Amorim (Foreign minister of Brazil) and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (Foreign minister of South Africa) met in Brasilia, where the IBSA Dialogue forum was formalized through the adoption of the \\"Brasilia Declaration\\". The IBSA Dialogue forum facilitates regular consultations at senior officials level, government (summit) levels as well as amongst academics, intellectuals and other members of the civil society. By some experts, it is also seen as an endeavor to challenge the international system by Pivotal Middle Powers through peaceful convincing, instead of other means.  Brasilia Declaration Indian PM Manmohan Singh with South African President Thabo Mbeki and Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva during the IBSA Summit, 2007. On 6 June 2003, the Brasilia declaration was signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa. They agreed on the urgent need for reforms in the United Nations, especially the Security Council. The declaration was of the view that the United Nations Security Council should reflect the current world scenario. It also touched upon the subjects of international terrorism, trans-national crime and illegal arms dealing, stating that such threats to international peace must effectively tackled with respect for the sovereignty of States and for International Law. The Ministers highlighted their priorities on promotion of social equity and inclusive growth by reiterating the need for tackling hunger and poverty by means of effective implementation of government schemes. The declaration also highlights the need for promoting family-run farms, food security, health, education, human rights and environmental protection. They recalled that social empowerment makes better use of human potential, contributing to economic development in a significant manner. The ministers also stressed the importance of elimination of racial discrimination and gender bias while framing While welcoming the benefits that have been achieved through globalization and free market trade in the developing countries, the ministers expressed their concerns that a large part of the world has not benefited from it. In this context, they reiterated their commitment to pursue and implement policies which are inclusive, integrative and equitable. Toward this end, they reaffirmed their stand to carry out negotiations on Doha round of talks, through which the developed countries might eliminate some of their protectionist and trade-distorting practices, thereby providing a level playing field for the developing countries in the field of international trade. The Ministers recommended to their respective Chiefs of State and/or Government the convening of a summit-level meeting of the three countries. They also decided to further intensify dialogue at all levels, when needed, to organize meetings of top officials and experts responsible for issues of mutual interest. They agreed to hold regular meetings and dialogues on issues of common interest. They further agreed to establish a Trilateral Joint Commission. The Foreign Ministries will be the pivots of the Trilateral Joint Commission and the meetings will be co-chaired by the three Foreign Ministers. The secretariat facilities shall be coordinated by the Secretary in charge of this area in the Foreign Ministry of the host country. Objectives The IBSA Dialogue Forum aims to promote South-South cooperation and build consensus on issues of international importance. It also aims at increasing the trade opportunities among the three countries, as well as facilitate the trilateral exchange of information, technologies and skills to complement each other strengths. Subsequently, it promotes the international poverty alleviation and social development with main focus being on equitable development.

It aims to improve production, promote and develop small-scale agro-industry. It also seeks to improve and diversify horticultural crops. IBSA Ministers of Agriculture met in Rome on 22 November 2005 on the margins of a FAO Conference. This was followed by a meeting of IBSA Senior Officials in Agriculture in New Delhi on 18 & 19 January 2006. The meeting discussed a preparation of a draft Memorandum of Understanding which provides for development of plans for research and capacity building. Education The three countries have recognised Education as a vital instrument for achieving social equity. India is the lead country in the education sector. Three major areas of cooperation have been identified for collaboration namely, Open and distance education, higher and professional education and finally, universal education with focus on gender equality. Each of the three countries are to host one Round Table conference on one of the themes. India chose universal education, Brazil chose higher and professional education while South Africa chose open and distance education. Energy The working group aims to promote clean and efficient sources of energy such as bio-fuels. It also gives an opportunity to exchange information about renewable energy and use of non-conventional energy sources. Science & technology Science & technology has been identified as one of the key areas of tri-lateral cooperation. The following is a list of approved areas of research cooperation and the corresponding lead countries: *HIV/AIDS and Nanotechnology- India *Malaria and Oceanography- Brazil *Tuberculosis and Biotechnology- South Africa Activities in each area are implemented by Area coordinators, who are experts in their respective disciplines. Workshops in the above-mentioned disciplines have been held in the three countries regularly. Trade The IBSA economic ministers met in New Delhi in March 2005 and agreed on a mechanism to identify and eliminate non-tariff barriers which impede mutual trade. Some of the mechanisms considered include customs cooperation, sharing of expertise in the field of energy, agriculture, food processing, tourism and financial and banking services. It has been decided to promote cooperation in the SME sector. For this purpose, common terms of reference have been developed which can aid in development of this sector. As, all the three countries have a large number of small-scale enterprises, it is expected that cooperation in this sector can have profound development implications. Transport The Working group aims at cooperation between the three countries in the areas of air link expansions, training and knowledge exchange in airports and airspace management, port management, including capacity building in shipbuilding. Discussions on air and maritime agreements are also being considered. Development of trans-shipment facilities for creation of a South-South highway, which integrates sub-regional connection between Mercosur, Southern African Customs Union and Indian regions, is a priority area for the Working group. Declarations and communiqu√© New Delhi agenda for cooperation Yashwant Sinha, Celso Amorim and Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa respectively, met in New Delhi on 4 and 5 March 2003 for the first meeting of the Trilateral Commission of the IBSA Dialogue Forum. The following issues were discussed: United Nations reforms The ministers were of the view that the current composition of the UN Security Council is not representative of the current world scenario. They highlighted the need for bringing about reforms which would make the Security council reflect the contemporary realities. Toward this end, they emphasised the need for expansion of Security council membership in the permanent as well as non- permanent categories. Peace and security The ministers took stock of the global security situation and renewed their commitments towards non- proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They agreed to intensify their cooperation at the IAEA with a view to ensure growth and development of use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under appropriate safeguards. On the Israel‚ÄìPalestine issue, the three countries urged an early resumption of dialogue on the basis of UN Security council resolutions, Arab League peace Initiative and the Quartet roadmap. They reaffirmed their support to the settlement postulated in the UN Security Council Resolution 1397 of two sovereign states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side within secured and recognised borders. The three countries also had common views with respect to Iraq. They stressed the need to maintain the unity & integrity of Iraq and called for transfer of full sovereignty to the Iraqi people. They were of the view that United Nations need to play a vital role in this context. They also emphasised the urgency of reconstruction in Iraq under a democratically elected sovereign government. Social development The three countries recognised the need to put people in the centre of development. Toward this end, the ministers emphasised the need to formulate people-centric policies which would ensure equitable development. As the three countries have a rich cultural history, strengthening of cultural ties by organising a trilateral cultural fair of music, dance and cinema in Brazil was also discussed. Recalling the Brasilia declaration, the ministers agreed upon the sharing of expertise in diverse areas such as food security, health, education, human rights etc. The Ministers also endorsed a proposal by Brazil to host a seminar on \\"Economic Growth with Social Equity\\" with the aim to promote better knowledge among IBSA members of their national policies and strategies to promote economic and social development.

New Partnership for Africa's Development The ministers resolved to support the economic development of the African Union and strengthen the IBSA partnership in the implementation of New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). Numerous opportunities exist in the fields of trade & commerce, energy, education, health and the ministers pledged to explore opportunities for trilateral cooperation in these areas. Latin and South American integration The ministers expressed their support for creation of an Asian-African business summit which would focus on promoting and strengthening the African private sector. They also made a decision to explore ways for closer cooperation with South America. The ministers also welcomed the efforts towards integration in the Latin America and Caribbean region and in this regard recognised the significance of the creation of the South American Community of Nations (CASA). World trade organisation The ministers agreed to intensify their cooperation in the WTO multilateral trade negotiations in the lead-up to the WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005 held in Hong Kong. This cooperation aimed to realise the Doha development agenda and to enhance trade opportunities in a free and fair manner with transparent-rules based multilateral trading system. IBSA sectoral cooperation The ministers reviewed the working of sectoral working groups and decided to add two new sectors namely, agriculture and culture. In the context of Information Technology, the ministers were of the view that their governments had many e-governance schemes which had many similarities, because of which they might share some information, best practices and identify projects for cooperation. The ministers agreed for strengthening consultations between the Ministries and Departments of Agriculture in support of IBSA and G-20 trade consultation processes. They decided that a meeting of IBSA experts would be convened in India to define areas for research and training in the field of agriculture. The ministers welcomed the launch of IBSA Business Council, which would work in tandem with the Working group jointly in the areas such as Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises.

Rio de Janeiro ministerial communiqu√© Anand Sharma, Celso Amorim and Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa respectively, met in Rio de Janeiro on 30 March 2006 for the third meeting of the Trilateral Commission of the IBSA Dialogue Forum. The following issues were raised and discussed: United Nations reforms The IBSA countries exchanged their views on UN security council reforms and reiterated their stand that representation of developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America as permanent members in the council was essential. They welcomed the creation of Peacebuilding commission and United Nations Human Rights Council, adding further that now UN reform process must include Security Council reform. Non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control The ministers were of the view that multilateral institutions established under various disarmament agreements should be the primary mechanism to achieve the desired objective of disarmament and non- proliferation. They agreed to continue cooperation at IAEA and other forums with regard to peaceful use of atomic energy under suitable safeguards. They also agreed to consider enhancing international civilian nuclear cooperation, with other nations who share similar objectives of non-proliferation. The ministers also hoped for a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear program, within the context of IAEA. International trade The ministers emphasised the need to unite on the issue of Doha round of negotiations. This is supported by increased consultations, by IBSA delegations, in order to strengthen Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA), as well as the establishment of the NAMA-11 whose two main principles are supporting flexibilities for developing countries and balance between NAMA and other areas under negotiation. The Ministers took note of the broader objectives of the European Union proposed Registration, Evaluation and Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Legislation, in respect of the protection of human health and the environment. They expressed their concern for the consequences REACH may have on the developing economies of the South. Such consequences will negatively affect the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries. The ministers urged the EU to give due consideration to these consequences and also ensure that REACH does not become a Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT). IBSA facility fund for hunger and poverty alleviation The fundamental character IBSA fund is to disseminate the best practices in alleviation of poverty and hunger. The ministers reaffirmed the importance of participation of institutions‚Äî governmental as well as non-governmental‚Äîin projects financed by the fund. They also recommended that UNDP, as an administrator of the fund, find means to make it possible. The ministers also received and accepted the recommendations of Technical Monitoring Committee (TMC) to Guinea Bissau. It urged the UNDP Office in Bissau to work closely with the UNDP Special Unit for South-South Cooperation in New York, the Coordinator of the project and the Guinean Bissau national authorities. The ministers agreed with the committee's recommendation of signing additional agreements with UNDP in order to clarify rights and obligations of both parties. IBSA sectoral cooperation The member countries made a pledge to promote the production and use of biofuels as a clean and ecofriendly alternative. More emphasis will be placed on exchange of information in areas of energy conservation and hydrogen energy. The ministers stressed the need to boost trade relations among the three nations. Keeping this in perspective, they expressed their satisfaction that Mercosur will be proposing to Southern African Customs Union and India the creation of a Working Group to explore the modalities of a Trilateral Free Trade Agreement (T-FTA) among them. Specific areas of agriculture have also been identified for trilateral cooperation. These include research and capacity building, agricultural trade, rural development and poverty alleviation. IBSA trade and investment forum The attending delegations were of the opinion that trade relations between the three nations can strengthen the South-South union. Substitution of imports from northern countries by imports from southern countries was suggested as a feasible solution towards attaining the said objective. Logistics, custom procedures, lack of information and distances were identified as main barriers which needed to be eliminated for the trilateral trade to flourish. The logistics problem was sought to be solved by suggestion of a study to further address the issue. Problems regarding customs procedures were sought to be tackled by ensuring more cooperation among the governmental institutions in order to simplify many regulations and streamlining the process. The private sector was also of the view that number of flights between India, Brazil and South Africa need to be increased, which eliminate the barrier of distances and lack of information no problem.  Agreements and Memorandum of Understanding The following agreements have been signed so far: *MoU on Agriculture and Allied Fields *MoU on Biofuels *Agreement on Merchant Shipping and Other Maritime Transport Matters *Action Plan on Trade Facilitation for Standards, Technical Regulations and Conformity Assessment *MoU Framework for Cooperation on the Information Society  BRICS  South Africa sought to join BRIC starting August 2010 and in December 2010 was officially invited to join. South Africa attended the April 2011 summit, and the group is now known as BRICS, with S standing for South Africa. Brazil,Russia,India,China,South Africa (BRICS) now represents a superset of the countries that IBSA represents. Some see BRICS and IBSA as potential geopolitical competitors.

At the time, Zw√∂lfmalgreien, Bolzano and Gries were three independent municipalities. Track The first built line started at the today called Guntschna street, near the former Guntschna funicular. From there it got to the Piazza Gries and to Talfer Bridge, to enter the Bolzano city. Today Piazza Gries and the Talfer Bridge are connected by a broad street, but this street was built later during Fascism in Italy, and so the tram crosses the field near small streets. In the center of Bolzano the track had some really small curve radius because of the old buildings. After arriving at Walther Square, where it meets the terminus track of the Rittnerbahn (or Renon Railway), the line went on the station alley and from there to Brennero Street. The second line was built in various sections, because the company that runs the Brennero railway thought the new tram would be a hard concurrent between Laives and Bolzano, since the Laives railway station was really far away from the village. Finally the line was built along the Brennero Street from Laives to Walther Square, where it shared the tracks with line one and the Renon railway until the Bolzano station, where it had its own terminus. Abandonment The company had some really good years, in which many local factories had their own tracks to the tram line. In the best years they bought some cars from the Merano tram company, which had some financial problems at that time. After World War II the network was abandoned and substituted by some bus lines. The now unused cars returned to the Merano tram company where they remained until the service was suspended. Today The former carhouse of the tram lines was still visible near Piazza della Vittoria-Siegesplatz up to some years ago. Like in some other cities in political campaigns of the local politicians sometimes there has been talk of reactivating the tram to reduce air pollution in the city, which today has a lot of traffic.

He was the scion of a family that made its wealth in Toledo, Ohio, being the founders of the grocery and department store Tiedtke's. He was a benefactor to individuals and the community, even as he did it in a quiet and unassuming manner.  Personal life  His parents were Ernest Tiedtke (1872‚Äì1950) and Anna Marie \\"Mamie\\" Meyer Tiedtke (1878‚Äì1981), of Toledo, Ohio. He was 7 years old when parents started spending time in Winter Park, Florida, in 1914. The state became his home as an adult. In 1948, he was married to Sylvia Southard, daughter of Prince and Princess Alfred Hohenlohe Schloss Friedstein of Streinach, Austria, and James Wendell Southard. Tiedtke died on December 22, 2004 at the age of 97 in Winter Park, Florida, less than a month after the death of his wife of 55 years. He attended Culver Military Academy and Dartmouth College, where in 1930 he received a bachelor's degree, and in 1932 a master's degree from its Tuck School of Business Administration.  Career  Tiedtke's parents founded the Toledo, Ohio, grocery and department store Tiedtke's which they sold in 1925 at the height of its popularity and retired to Florida in the winters. John's father, Ernest, had been a farmer before starting the grocery chain, and with the help of family money John went into the farming business too. In the 1930s he began buying land for sugar- cane farms, he found land was so cheap because of the Great Depression he could buy it for the cost of its unpaid property tax. He became a prominent and leading sugar, citrus and corn farmer, and cattleman, owning large spreads in Central Florida.See After World War II, he did not enlist due to a bad knee, he was hired by Rollins College to teach returning soldiers business classes. He was director of the Palm Beach County Agricultural Advisory Committee. In October 1945, he testified before the Committee on Appropriations of the United States Congress about the availability of migrant labor on sugar plantations. He patented a cane loading and chopping machine. Tiedtke was a philanthropist and patron of the arts. He is noted for championing and supporting various fine arts programs in Central Florida including the Bach Festival Society of Winter Park and the Enzian Theater. He was instrumental in funding a unique film festival. In 1949, \\"Tiedtke breathed life into the Florida Symphony Orchestra\\" and was a founding member. He was a full professor of economics beginning in 1951, becoming the school's first dean of graduate programs (1960 to 1965). He was its business manager, treasurer and second vice president. He became Vice President, Treasurer and Business Manager of the college. He devoted 20 years to being on the Board of Directors of Rollins College. He donated magnanimously to both the Rollins College Music and Theater Departments. He was the owner of the Tiedtke well in Punta Gorda, Florida, which was the source of an unusual sample of Punta Gorda Anhydrite which he photographed. Legacy Upon his death, the Orlando Sentinel wrote, \\"The arts in Central Florida lost a giant on Tuesday. He created wealth by investing in sugar, citrus and corn farms on land near Lake Okeechobee. Land companies, development companies, Shawnee Cattle and Atlas Sugar were among his holdings. But it was what he did with that wealth that has had so much impact. He spent millions bringing music, film, and art to his adopted home of Central Florida.\\" Florida Today said Tiedtke \\"was another important figure in the cultural development of Winter Park\\" who \\"was very successful in the state's sugar industry\\". Orlando Magazine noted that Tiedtke was \\"a savior to nearly every arts organization in town, including the Bach Festival, Florida Symphony Orchestra, Orlando Museum of Art, Orlando Opera, and Festival of Orchestras‚Äîall that besides being a founder/funder of United Arts of Central Florida\\". He individually funded the 400-seat John M. Tiedtke Concert Hall at Rollins. It is the music department's \\"flagship venue and features two Steinway D Concert grand pianos.\\" Tiedtke established the John M. Tiedtke Endowed Chair of Music funded in part by an anonymous $250,000 donation from Fred Rogers, who was TV's Mister Rogers and alumni of Rollins. In 1972, he was one of eight Floridians to receive a \\"C.H.I.E.F.\\" award (\\"Champions of Higher Independent Education in Florida\\") from the Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida. In 1973, Florida Governor Reubin Askew gave him one of the \\"Governor's Awards for the Arts\\". The Tiedtke family's mausoleum is in Section 42 at Woodlawn Cemetery in Toledo, Ohio. In 2019, in honor of the fifteenth anniversary of his passing, a memorial concert was dedicated to him at the Bach Festival Society, along with other memorial events in Winter Park.

The company offers transactional video on demand rentals and digital purchases of films, as well as integration with digital locker services for streaming digital copies of films purchased as home video at retail. The service initially focused on a digital media player known as the Vudu Box. In 2010, the company began to abandon its hardware business, and focus on integrating its service and associated app platform into third-party devices such as televisions and Blu-ray Disc players. The company has since offered its services online, via mobile apps, and on devices such as digital media players and smart TVs. In 2010, Vudu was sold to Walmart. In 2020, Fandango acquired Vudu for an undisclosed amount. History Vudu was founded by Tony Miranz and Alain Rossmann (the creator of WAP). The Vudu Box had been secretly in development since 2004, but on 29 April 2007, The New York Times revealed that Vudu had signed deals with many movie studios and independent distributors to deliver access to nearly 5,000 films. , Vudu had received $21 million in venture capital funding from Greylock Partners and Benchmark Capital. The company is based in Santa Clara, California. In May 2008, Vudu began displaying and selling its set-top box in Best Buy stores. Before this time, the box was only available via online retailers. In October, Vudu announced that it would begin to stream films in 1080p high definition, branded as \\"HDX\\". These films would feature a series of encoding and processing techniques branded as \\"TruFilm\\", including the dampening of artifacting and pixelation associated with darker areas of pictures, film grain preservation, \\"color gradient processing\\" to improve appearance on flat- panel televisions, and \\"statistical variable bitrate\\" to optimize streaming performance. On 24 February 2009, Vudu became the first on-demand service to offer high-definition movies for download to own. Prior to Vudu allowing users to purchase high-definition movies, studios only allowed their films to be purchased in standard-definition format. LG was the first to integrate Vudu into its HDTVs, with access beginning in August 2009 through the TV's NetCast application. On 8 January 2010, at Consumer Electronics Show, Vudu announced that it would phase out its in-house hardware business, in favor of focusing on integration of its rich Internet application platform, \\"Vudu Apps\\" (which featured Vudu as well as other streaming video and internet services), directly into internet-connected televisions and Blu-ray players, with initial hardware partners including LG, Magnavox, Mitsubishi, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Toshiba, and Vizio. On 22 February 2010, Walmart announced its intent to acquire Vudu. The company had previously attempted to offer digital video sales in 2007, but the service folded due to competition with iTunes Store. In order to comply with Walmart's content policies, Vudu subsequently discontinued its \\"After Dark\\" service (a collaboration with AVN), which offered pornographic content. In 2012, Vudu partnered with UltraViolet, an industry-backed digital locker offering online streaming of retail DVD and Blu-ray disc purchases. In 2014, Vudu also joined Disney's competing Movies Anywhere initiative. In February 2020, it was reported that Comcast (via NBCUniversal) had entered talks into acquiring Vudu from Walmart. In April 2020, it was announced that NBCUniversal subsidiary Fandango Media would acquire Vudu for an undisclosed amount; the sale closed on 6 July 2020. Fandango is minority owned by Warner Bros., and operates a similar service FandangoNow. As part of the sale, Walmart will maintain its relationships with Vudu, including account integration and promotion of the service via Walmart's website. The service is expected compliment to NBCUniversal's Peacock service.  Content  As of June 2019, Vudu's selection contains over 24,000 titles in their catalog and over 8,000 television shows, making it one of the largest streaming providers of its kind. Titles range from major motion pictures, independent films, documentaries, children's programming, anime, musicals, recorded musical performances, cartoons, and television series. Vudu has established content licensing contracts with all major movie studios as well as over 50 smaller and independent studios. Films are available to rent in standard-definition, high-definition, and 4K ultra high definition formats, with Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 available on supported devices and content. In October 2016, Vudu added a free, ad-supported streaming library to its platform in the United States branded as \\"Movies on Us\\", featuring recent and classic films. In October 2018, Vudu partnered with MGM Television to develop and acquire original programming for Movies on Us, with a focus on \\"family-friendly, advertiser-friendly content\\" derived from existing MGM properties. Vudu premiered its first original series, Mr. Mom‚Äîa continuation of the 1983 film of the same name, on 12 September 2019.

A South Korean survey conducted between April 1966 and November 1989 of 4909 sites south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone found it in 659 sites; it was not seen to appear in the Yeongsan, Sapgyo, or Anseong rivers. It typically spawns between the beginning of May and the middle of June. Has photos. Coreoleuciscus splendidus grows to roughly 10 to 15 cm in length, with a long, slender body and a pointed snout; its eyes are small and horseshoe-shaped. Its head is greyish-brown in colour, while its back is darker and its stomach is lighter, often approaching white in hue; it also has a light stripe running along the length of its body on each side. The stripe is typically yellow, though specimens with orange stripes can also be found and are considered to be more attractive. It is often used for decorative purposes; feeding it sources of carotenoids, specifically spirulina or paprika, has been observed to improve the colour definition of its skin and fins.  In popular culture  The 1999 South Korean film Shiri was named after C. splendidus; the fish appears prominently in tanks in the offices of the main characters, and one of the film's primary antagonists has a monologue which discusses the fish and the effect that the division of Korea has had on it.

He told them that he would organise an English team to participate in the next competition, that was held in 1909. Lipton wanted a team from the Northern League in England to come over to Turin and his decision led to the participation of West Auckland FC from County Durham in the 1909 and 1911 tournaments.

The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical; with slopes between 30‚Äì40¬∞; and a nearly circular ground plan. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.  Mechanics of eruption  Cross-section diagram of a cinder cone or scoria cone The rock fragments, often called cinders or scoria, are glassy and contain numerous gas bubbles \\"frozen\\" into place as magma exploded into the air and then cooled quickly. Cinder cones range in size from tens to hundreds of meters tall. Cinder cones are made of pyroclastic material. Many cinder cones have a bowl- shaped crater at the summit. During the waning stage of a cinder-cone eruption, the magma has lost most of its gas content. This gas-depleted magma does not fountain but oozes quietly into the crater or beneath the base of the cone as lava. Lava rarely issues from the top (except as a fountain) because the loose, uncemented cinders are too weak to support the pressure exerted by molten rock as it rises toward the surface through the central vent. Because it contains so few gas bubbles, the molten lava is denser than the bubble-rich cinders. Thus, it often burrows out along the bottom of the cinder cone, lifting the less dense cinders like a cork on water, and advances outward, creating a lava flow around the cone's base. When the eruption ends, a symmetrical cone of cinders sits at the center of a surrounding pad of lava. If the crater is fully breached, the remaining walls form an amphitheatre or horseshoe shape around the vent.  Occurrence  Par√≠cutin erupting in 1943 Cinder cones are commonly found on the flanks of shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, and calderas. For example, geologists have identified nearly 100 cinder cones on the flanks of Mauna Kea, a shield volcano located on the island of Hawaii. The most famous cinder cone, Paricutin, grew out of a corn field in Mexico in 1943 from a new vent. Eruptions continued for nine years, built the cone to a height of , and produced lava flows that covered . The Earth's most historically active cinder cone is Cerro Negro in Nicaragua. It is part of a group of four young cinder cones NW of Las Pilas volcano. Since its initial eruption in 1850, it has erupted more than 20 times, most recently in 1995 and 1999. Based on satellite images it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the solar system too. They were reported on the flanks of Pavonis Mons in Tharsis, in the region of Hydraotes Chaos on the bottom of the Coprates Chasma, or in the volcanic field Ulysses Colles. It is also suggested that domical structures in Marius Hills might represent lunar cinder cones.  Effect of environmental conditions  SP Crater, an extinct cinder cone in Arizona The size and shape of cinder cones depend on environmental properties as different gravity and/or atmospheric pressure might change the dispersion of ejected scoria particles. For example, cinder cones on Mars seem to be more than two times wider than terrestrial analogues as lower atmospheric pressure and gravity enable wider dispersion of ejected particles over a larger area. Therefore, it seems that erupted amount of material is not sufficient on Mars for the flank slopes to attain the angle of repose and Martian cinder cones seem to be ruled mainly by ballistic distribution and not by material redistribution on flanks as typical on Earth.  Monogenetic cones  Some cinder cones are monogenetic ‚Äì the result of a single, never-to-be-repeated eruption. Par√≠cutin in Mexico, Diamond Head, Koko Head, Punchbowl Crater and some cinder cones on Mauna Kea are monogenetic cinder cones. Monogenetic eruptions can last for more than 10 years. Par√≠cutin erupted from 1943 to 1952.

He was born in Brussels, the son of Edouard Woeste, who was of Prussian descent who became a naturalized Belgian on 15 January 1841. Edouard Woeste was consul for Prussia from 1843 to 1853 and married Constance Vauthier on 24 September 1834. In August 1855 Charles converted from Lutheranism, Prussian aristocracy's religion, to Catholicism, under the influence of his mother and father Delcourt. On 4 January 1866, he married Marie Greindl, daughter of lieutenant-general L√©onard Greindl, who had been minister of war in the government of Pierre de Decker (1855). Education In October 1847, Charles joined the Royal Athenaeum of Brussels. Among his classmates were Edmond Picard, Charles Graux, Emile de Mot, Xavier Olin, and Pierre Van Humbeeck. He obtained the title of Doctor in Law at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles in 1858. Career He began his career as a lawyer at the bar of Brussels. His political career developed within the Catholic Party and he played a very important role in this party. He started his political career at the Catholic Conference in Mechelen. In 1869, Woeste founded the Verbond van Katholieke Kringen, an early attempt to create a Catholic party. In 1921, this party was renamed in the Catholic Union of workers, citizens, tradesmen and farmers. After his death, on the occasion of the large election defeat of the Catholics in 1936 this Catholic Union was replaced by the Catholic Block. During his political career, Woeste was a longtime member of the Belgian parliament for the district Aalst, after earlier attempts in the district Bruges had failed. In Aalst, he and Count opposed the Christian Democratic priest Adolf Daens and his Christene Volkspartij. Woeste strongly opposed the rising social state interventionism of the Christian Democrats. On 15 November 1891, he was made Minister of State. Pope Leo XIII also bestowed upon him the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. Woeste spent the rest of his life in Brussels, and a street there is named after him. A bust was erected in his honour on Place Boniface in Ixelles.

There have been three small railways, but none became part of the public transport network. The main reasons for the lack of railways are the small population, competition with automobile traffic, and the harsh environment. Proposals for railways in Iceland began in the early 1900s, with a proposed line between Reykjav√≠k and Selfoss but these were abandoned. In the 2000s there were new proposals for both a light railway system in the Capital Region and an airport rail link to Keflav√≠k.  Reykjav√≠k Harbour Railway   The track network  Map of Reykjav√≠k Harbour Railway from 1902 by N. P. Kirk Locomotive Pioner as preserved today. Locomotive Min√∏r as preserved today. Probably the most well- known Icelandic rail project, the Reykjav√≠k Harbour Railway, of narrow gauge, operated from 1913 until 1928 for the construction of the harbour breakwaters. The railway operated from a quarry outside the city, √ñskjuhl√≠√∞, from which it ran a short distance to a junction, passing loop, and sidings. This junction was located just south of a large field which became (and remains) the Reykjav√≠k city airport. From here one line ran to the west, around the western edge of the city, before proceeding along the newly constructed western harbour pier to the island of Effersey. Here a headshunt allowed trains to reverse along a further line, built out onto the outer harbour wall, and extended as that wall itself grew longer. From the first junction a second line ran east around farms to a locomotive depot just outside the city and on to a further junction where a short branch line led into a secondary quarrying site (now in the heart of the capital's residential district) whilst the main line continued to a further junction on the edge of the docks. From here one line ran along the quayside (where one of the locomotives is today preserved on display) whilst the other ran out along the eastern harbour wall. The locomotives The railway was operated by two steam locomotives built by the Jung engine company of Germany, both of which have been preserved. Built in the 1890s in Germany, they worked briefly in Denmark before being imported to Iceland in 1913 for the harbour railway project. Locomotive Pioner is now a static exhibit at the Icelandic Folk Museum at Arb√¶r, √Årb√¶r Museum, whilst locomotive Min√∏r, after many years of storage in a Nissen hut under piles of rubbish, is now an open-air static exhibit in Reykjav√≠k. A scale model of part of this railway, showing one of the locomotives at work, is displayed in the Reykjav√≠k Maritime Museum. Min√∏r was the first to be withdrawn, whilst Pioner (which had received a replacement boiler in 1910 to extend its life) continued to operate until the railway closed in 1928. The rolling stock The mainstay vehicle of this railway was the four-wheeled open wagon. A large number of these wagons operated, and they were built with fully opening sides for loading and unloading. It is not thought that any of these vehicles has survived. Incidents Iceland's first railway accident was on the Reykjavik Harbour Railway. Records at the √Årb√¶r Museum show that both locomotives of the Reykjav√≠k Harbour Railway were involved in accidents between the two world wars. Pioner was deliberately derailed by vandals who placed a chain across the track and weighted down its two sides with rocks. They later claimed that they were testing the locomotive's performance as it had already survived their previous experiments of placing coins and planks on the track. Min√∏r was involved in a genuine accident when a section of track gave way beneath the engine. This was later found to have been caused by rotten wooden sleepers supporting this section of track.Both incidents are recorded in the library archives of the √Årb√¶r folk museum, Reykjav√≠k. K√°rahnj√∫kar light railway A diesel-operated light railway built in the early years of the 21st century in connection with the construction of the K√°rahnj√∫kar hydro-electric power project. The railway consists of three trains, travelling around the clock. The three trains transported people, concrete and other items to keep the drilling machines running. The train sets consisted of white coloured locomotive and wagons. The trainsets were built by Sch√∂ma of Germany. Its lifespan was limited to the construction period of this project, and it has now closed. Much of the equipment used was leased from Schoma Lokomotiven of Germany and has returned there. Incidents In 2004, the first collision of two trains occurred in Iceland. A passenger train transporting construction workers ran into a cement train in a tunnel, lying under Val√æj√≥fsta√∞arfjall mountain. Three people were treated for their injuries in the rail mishap. Korp√∫lfssta√∞ir farm railway Korp√∫lfssta√∞ir was one of the first industrial farms in Iceland. Built in 1930 by Icelandic industrialist Thor Jensen, it was located on the outskirts of Reykjav√≠k, on the √ûingvellir road. The farm was equipped with a narrow-gauge railway network, allowing the transportation of goods and materials around the farm site. The rolling stock consisted chiefly of four-wheel skip wagons. There were no operational locomotives during either documented visit to this railway (in 1984 and 1993),A full report of the 1984 visit may be found about half way through this article on Narrow Gauge Heaven. and trains were shunted by hand, by the farm's staff. It is not known whether the railway was originally equipped with locomotives. Korp√∫lfssta√∞ir Farm has now closed and the site has been developed as a golf course and an elementary school, incorporating most of the original farm buildings. There is no surviving part of this railway network.  Mainline railways in the 1900s   First proposals  In 1906 the first official proposals for railways in Iceland were made. The route would run from Reykjav√≠k to Selfoss via √ûingvallavatn. This route would allow extensions to Akranes/Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur, Rangarv√∂llur. Surveys were made in the summer by the instigation of the Prime Minister, Hannes Hafstein. Over the next few years more surveys were made by engineer J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson in regard to snowfall and cost estimates, including a cost comparison between oil and coal powered systems.  Proposals in the 1920s  In 1921, Al√æingi decided to look at the possibility of railways again. Subsequently, in 1922-1923 a Danish engineer conducted surveys about a route from Reykjav√≠k to Selfoss via √ûrengsli. It was the shortest and cheapest solution. The route was envisioned to carry both passenger and freight which would have been cheaper than existing methods of transportation. In 1927 the city development plan of Reykjav√≠k included a railway terminus just outside the Reykjav√≠k city centre in Nor√∞urm√Ωri with multiple platforms. Automobile traffic was rising and there was a need for better roads. Comparisons were made between a road vs. rail system in Iceland, and it was eventually determined that roads would take priority. In 1931 plans for railways in Iceland were abandoned. Recently proposed railways There have been intermittent proposals for a passenger railway from Reykjav√≠k to Keflav√≠k International Airport, firstly in the early 2000s. In 2003 the idea of an airport railway was eliminated and a dual carriageway road (road 41) was built instead of the railway, opening in 2008. More recently, a private group has been looking into the idea of an airport railway. In 2014, a feasibility study was undertaken by R√°√∞gj√∂f og verkefnastj√≥rnun, which declared that a high speed airport railway would be feasible with the increasing numbers of tourists coming to Iceland and passenger numbers at Keflav√≠k International Airport. The project has begun looking for funding and has begun talks with the local municipalities about the planning and alignment of the railway. The railway would run double tracked from the airport, roughly parallel to the current road, and would then be placed in tunnels from Hafnafj√∂r√∞ur with a terminal at Reykjav√≠k's main bus station BS√ç¬ç. The maximum operating speed is 250 km/h, and the journey would take 15 minutes. In 2015 \\"Fluglestin √ûr√≥unarf√©lag ehf.\\" was created with the intention of acquiring funding for the project and planning. The proposed English name for the project is \\"Lava Express\\". Initially the project planned that construction should start in 2020. In 2019, all municipalities the rail line would pass through have approved a cooperation agreement on zoning related to the project except Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur, with Morgunbla√∞i√∞ reporting that a meeting with the mayor of Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur has been scheduled. Once fully agreed, construction work could begin as early as 2022. Light rail There have also been serious proposals for a light rail system for the Capital Region (Reykjav√≠k, K√≥pavogur, Hafnafj√∂r√∞ur). In the Samt√∂k Sveitarf√©laga √° H√∂fuborgasv√¶√∞inu's(Association of municipalities in the Capital Area) master plan for the capital area, H√∂fuborgasv√¶√∞i√∞ 2040, the transport section outlines a plan to create a light rail/BRT system in the Capital Area. The mayors of the respective municipalities have agreed to this masterplan and have shown interest in this proposal and it is currently in a planning stage. There has been pressure put on Al√æingi and the municipalities to clarify on how the project will be funded.

This line was part of a rail sightseeing tour around the Mendelpass. The tour was made up of five railway lines and was often used by tourists.  Track  Just after the station of Bolzano the track branched off from the Brennerbahn and ran along the Eisack river. The line crossed the Talfer river and after two small stations (Ponte Roma and Ponte Resia) the line became split: one track proceeded to Meran and further to the Vinschgerbahn and one track branched away leftwards toward the low mountain range plateau of √úberetsch. After a long bridge over the Adige river, the line got steeper and after two short tunnels reached the √úberetsch plateau. Here the trains only stopped in Eppan, Kaltern and Sankt Anton, near the Mendel Funicular station. The strange thing was, that the track to the Sankt Anton station left the mainline before it arrived to the Kaltern station, so the trains had to run to Kaltern station, drive back to the switch, change driving direction again and then go further to the Sankt Anton station.  History  The railroad had been built to reach the √úberetsch plateau more easily. The two biggest villages on the plateau Kaltern and Eppan are to this day important tourist destinations. The railroad made it easier to get tourists to the villages and the wine from the villages to the station of Bolzano, where it was loaded onto international freight trains. Today The line was finally abandoned on June 28, 1971. At the Eppan station, the tracks were replaced by a new street to guide traffic around the village. In the early 2000s, parts of the line were converted to a bicycle trail. Due to the number of bicycle riders, the roads from Bolzano towards the √úberetsch plateau are jammed by traffic, and officials in Kaltern/Caldaro and Eppan/Appiano are supporting the idea to reactivate the line as a commuter.

Different tapers are used for different fishing scenarios as well as for personal preference. Action The action of a taper is described by the flex of the tip of a rod when pressure is applied perpendicular to the rod. Only a section of the rod starting at the tip of the rod should bend while the remainder of the rod should stay rigid. Variations can be described in three main categories, fast, medium, or slow with variations in between each. A rod with a fast taper will only flex the top 20 percent. Medium fast and medium tapers will flex approximately 30 to 60 percent of the rod respectively. If the rod has a slow taper, almost the entire rod or blank will bend or flex under pressure. Usage Rod taper is important for several reasons. The feel for the lure being used and the fish being caught dictate the appropriate taper use. A fast action tip will be used when fishing jig type lures. The angler can feel and therefore control what the lure is doing quite easily. Since only the very tip of the rod bends, when a fish strikes the angler has ample rod shaft and backbone to set the hook correctly. In contrast to fast tapers, the slow flex rods offer the angler advantages when fighting large fish with light fishing line. This additional flex allows the rod to absorb the force of the fish as opposed to the line. This is often the angler who likes to fish split shot rigs or Lindy rigs for walleye.

The species is very common, and widespread in marine, brackish and freshwater environments.Carey, Philip G. Marine interstitial ciliates: an illustrated key. 1992. p. 128 Appearance and physical characteristics Drawing by Alfred Kahl \\"Slipper animalcule\\", illustrated by Louis Joblot, 1718 thumb Paramecium caudatum is 170‚Äì330 micrometres long (usually 200‚Äì300 micrometres). The cell body is spindle-shaped, rounded at the front, tapering at the posterior to a blunt point. Early microscopists likened its shape to that of a slipper, and commonly referred to it as the \\"slipper animalcule.\\" The pellicle is uniformly covered with cilia, and has a long oral groove, leading to deeply embedded oral cavity, lined with cilia (short, hair-like protoplasmic processes that serve as organs of locomotion and food capture). P. caudatum has two contractile vacuoles, which serve to excrete excess water taken up from the outside, regulating the water contents of the body. Radially distributed \\"collecting canals\\" give the contractile vacuoles a distinctive star-like shape. The cell is enclosed by a cellular envelope (cortex) densely studded with spindle-shaped extrusomes called trichocysts. P. caudatum feed on bacteria and small eukaryotic cells, such as yeast and flagellate algae. the accumulated food particles, at the posterior end of the cytopharynx, are directed by the long cilia into the rounded, ball-like mass in the endoplasm called food vacuole. The food vacuoles are circulated by the streaming movement of the endoplasm which is called cyclosis. In hypotonic conditions (freshwater), the cell absorbs water by osmosis. It regulates osmotic pressure with the help of bladder-like contractile vacuoles, gathering internal water through its star-shaped radial canals and expelling the excess through the plasma membrane. When moving through the water, they follow a spiral path while rotating on the long axis. Paramecium have two nuclei (a large macronucleus and a single compact micronucleus). They cannot survive without the macronucleus and cannot reproduce without the micronucleus. Like all ciliates, Paramecia reproduce asexually, by binary fission. During reproduction, the macronucleus splits by a type of amitosis, and the micronuclei undergo mitosis. The cell then divides transversally, and each new cell obtains a copy of the micronucleus and the macronucleus.Lynn, Denis. The ciliated protozoa: characterization, classification, and guide to the literature. Springer, 2010. 279. Fission may occur as part of the normal vegetative cell cycle. Under certain conditions, it may be preceded by self- fertilization (autogamy),Berger, James D. \\"Autogamy in Paramecium cell cycle stage-specific commitment to meiosis.\\" Experimental cell research 166.2 (1986): 475‚Äì485. or it may follow conjugation, a sexual phenomenon in which Paramecia of compatible mating types fuse temporarily and exchange genetic material. During conjugation, the micronuclei of each conjugant divide by meiosis and the haploid gametes pass from one cell to the other. The gametes of each organism then fuse to form diploid micronuclei. The old macronuclei are destroyed, and new ones are developed from the new micronuclei.Prescott, D. M., et al. \\"DNA of ciliated protozoa.\\" Chromosome 34.4 (1971): 355‚Äì366. Without the rejuvenating effects of autogamy or conjugation a Paramecium ages and dies. Only opposite mating types, or genetically compatible organisms, can unite in conjugation.

Her voice was very powerful and pleasing to audiences.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/arts/music/anita-cerquetti-opera- fill-in-who-soared-dies-at-83.html?_r=0 Career Cerquetti was born in Montecosaro, near Macerata, Italy. She originally studied violin and trained eight years with Luigi Mori. After a mere year of vocal study at the Conservatory of Perugia, she made her operatic debut in Spoleto in 1951 as Aida. She sang all over Italy, notably in Florence as Noraime in Gli Abencerragi (the Italian version of Les Abenc√©rages) under Carlo Maria Giulini in 1956, and as Elvira in Ernani under Dimitri Mitropoulos in 1957. Her La Scala debut was in 1958 as Abigaille in Nabucco. She also sang on RAI in a wide variety of roles, such as Anaide in Mos√®, Mathilde in Guglielmo Tell and Elena in I vespri siciliani. Cerquetti made headlines in January 1958 when she replaced \\"in extremis\\" the ailing Maria Callas in Norma, at the Rome Opera House.G. B. Meneghini (1981). My Wife Maria Callas. London, The Bodley Head, p. 265. She was already singing the role at the San Carlo in Naples. She commuted between the two cities to honor both engagements for several weeks. This \\"tour de force\\" won her great acclaim, but had serious effects on her health.\\"Anita Cerquetti - obituary\\", in The Daily Telegraph, Friday 31 October 2014 (accessed 3 November 2014). Shortly afterward she started withdrawing little by little from the stage until her complete retirement in 1961, aged only 30. She was due to have made her debut at The Royal Opera House in the title role in Aida in July 1958,\\"Visconti to produce Don Carlos\\", in The Times, Saturday March 8, 1958, p. 3 column B. but was forced to withdraw following an appendectomy in late June. She was replaced by Leontyne Price.\\"A New Star at Covent Garden\\", in The Times, Thursday July 3, 1958, p. 5 column D. Anita Cerquetti was thus destined never to sing at Covent Garden. Cerquetti sang relatively little in America. Her debut there was at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1955, as Amelia in Un ballo in maschera opposite Jussi Bj√∂rling, under Tullio Serafin. She made only two commercial recordings, both for Decca in 1957, a recital of Italian opera arias and a complete La Gioconda with Mario Del Monaco, Ettore Bastianini, Giulietta Simionato and Cesare Siepi under Gianandrea Gavazzeni. Among her \\"pirated\\" recordings is a 1958 Aida from Mexico City, with Flaviano Lab√≤, Nell Rankin, Cornell MacNeil, Fernando Corena and Norman Treigle. The 1958 Rome production of Norma with Franco Corelli is also available.

Four Scimitars were produced for the Norwegian Army Air Service and were delivered in 1936. Design and development The A.W.35 Scimitar was a development of Armstrong Whitworth's earlier Armstrong Whitworth A.W.16 fighter, powered by an Armstrong Siddeley Panther engine, with a lowered nose decking and an enlarged fin and rudder. The first prototype (G-ACCD) was a modification of the second A.W.16, and first flew in this form on 29 April 1935. A second prototype (G-ADBL) was constructed by converting another A.W.16. Operational history Four Scimitars were ordered for the Norwegian Army Air Service, and an agreement signed for licence production at the Norwegian Army Aircraft Factory at Kjeller. After testing by the A & AEE at Martlesham Heath in late 1935, the four Scimitars were delivered to Norway in 1936. The licence agreement was cancelled later that year when it was found that the aircraft was unsuitable for operation on skis without further design changes. The Scimitars remained in use in the training role at the outbreak of the Second World War. When the Germans invaded in 1940 the Scimitars were all undergoing maintenance and could not be made operational in time to see combat. The second prototype Scimitar was preserved by Armstrong Whitworth at its Whitley factory until 1958, when it was scrapped.

It is navigable by boat all year round. The Turag suffers from infilling along its banks, which restricts its flow. It also suffers from acute water pollution.

History Earlier this river was called as (Bengali: \\"Kohor Doriya\\"), \\"Kohor river\\". Religious significance Tabligh Jam'at, a popular Islamic movement originating in South Asia, initially took hold in Dhaka in the 1950s as Maulana Abdul Aziz and other leaders set up the regional headquarters at the Kakrail Mosque near Ramna Park. An initiative of the movement is an emphasis on the six u·π£≈´l or \\"basic principles,\\" two of which include ilm, the pursuit of knowledge, and dhikr or zikr, a method of prayer involving repetitive invocation of hadith and Qur'an passages. To this end, the movement places importance on ijtema or assembly, where members gather to practice and participate in dhikr, hear religious sermons and discuss their activities. The largest of these, the Bishwa Ijtema, is situated by the Turag River in Tongi and attracts estimates of between two and four million Muslims annually as well as representatives from over sixty countries, making it the second biggest Islamic congregation after the Hajj.

He attended Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Performing Arts and complemented his education on the streets by writing graffiti and performing worldwide with breakdancing crews. Bua went on to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, where he earned a B.F.A in illustration and taught figure drawing at the University of Southern California for ten years. Fine Art Bua's distinctive figurative style combines his classical training with his background in graffiti, breakdancing and experience living in New York City. The subjects of his paintings range from recognizable figures, such as Snoop Dogg and Muhammad Ali, to anonymous people pulled from his memories, including the DJ and guitar player for which he has become best known. Each of Bua's subjects is ennobled within the urban landscape he paints and is often rendered with elongated limbs or hands, emphasizing the rhythm of the scene. Bua exhibits worldwide and was featured in a 2011 event at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Commercial Art Launching his reputation in the world of commercial art, Bua has designed and illustrated a myriad of products that include skateboards, CD album covers, apparel and advertising campaigns. He has also developed successful visual concepts in the entertainment world, including: the opening sequence of MTV's sketch-comedy television series, The Lyricist Lounge Show (2000-2001), EA Sports video games NBA Street (2001), NFL Street (2004), Slum Village's award- winning music video Tainted and Toyota's Long Beach Grand Prix campaign. Speaking and Entrepreneurship In July 2013 Bua became the first artist to launch an online school with ArtistWorks, allowing students around the world of varying levels of experience to study his curriculum and interact digitally through video exchange. In 2013, Bua collaborated with leading nutritionist David Wolfe to create the superfood drink mix, Immortal Machine.

Early life The son of Dr John Kiszely and Mrs Kiszely, Kiszely was educated at Marlborough College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst before being commissioned into the Scots Guards as a second lieutenant on 20 December 1968. Military career Kiszely served with the regiment as a platoon commander, company commander and commanding officer in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands.Oxford Leverhulme Biography Kiszely was awarded the Military Cross for an action during the Battle of Mount Tumbledown during the Falklands War, where he led an attack in close quarter battle against determined resistance through the Argentine position which drove them from the summit. Kiszely became commanding officer of 1st Battalion the Scots Guards in 1986 and, following various other military appointments, took command of 7th Armoured Brigade in early 1993. In 1996 he was appointed General Officer Commanding 1st (UK) Armoured Division and served as Commander of the Multi-National Division (South-West) in Bosnia.SFOR In September 1998 Kiszely was appointed Assistant Chief of Defence Staff (Resource and Plans) at the Ministry of Defence.NATO/SFOR Informer In 2002 he was appointed Commander of Regional Forces at Land Command and, in 2004, he was deployed as Senior British Military Representative and Deputy Commanding General, Multinational Force, Iraq.

He took over the role from Air Marshal Ian Macfadyen, who recommended him for the post.Royal British Legion appoints new National President Royal British Legion, 15 December 2008 In an October 2012 article, the Sunday Times alleged that Kiszely was among several retired military leaders who had offered to lobby and influence MPs and government defence ministers on behalf of arms firms. When the Royal British Legion announced it was setting up an inquiry into Kiszely's behaviour, he resigned, admitting that he had made \\"exaggerated and foolish claims\\" and therefore it would be \\"inappropriate\\" for him to keep his role at the Legion. However, he claimed that he had not broken Whitehall rules. Defence secretary Philip Hammond said that the allegations against Kiszely and others are damaging and that he may restrict the access that former officers have to current staff. \\"If they're abusing that access for commercial purposes then we will have to tighten it up or maybe even shut it down,\\" he said. However, he argued that former military officers did not have influence on how the Ministry of Defence spends taxpayers' money. The Ministry of Defence said it would investigate whether Kiszely and other ex-generals implicated by the investigation had broken any rules and if so, what punishment was appropriate.

Since retiring from playing professionally, Calloway has coached teams in several US leagues. Playing career England Calloway began his professional playing career with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1962, but failed to make an appearance for their first team. He remained with Wolves until 1964 when he dropped down the league to join Rochdale where he would spend four seasons. He spent the next thirteen years as a journeyman bouncing from one lower division club to another. In 1968 Calloway moved to Second Division Blackburn Rovers. After two seasons with Rovers he was sent to Division Four club Southport in August 1970 in exchange for Alex Russel. A year later Southport transferred Calloway to fellow Division Four club York City. He left York to his final English club Shrewsbury Town in 1972, where he remained for two seasons. NASL In 1974, Calloway left England to try his fortunes with the North American Soccer League. He signed with the San Jose Earthquakes. Over the next twenty-two years, he would return time and time again to the San Francisco Bay Area as both a player and a coach. From 1974 until 1977, Calloway became an integral part of the Earthquakes. His playing time peaked in 1977 when he saw time in 26 games and scored two goals. However, he received his greatest recognition in his first year with the team when he was selected as an NASL All Star Honorable Mention (third team). In 1978, he left the Earthquakes to coach and play for the Southern California Lazers of the American Soccer League (ASL), but was back in San Jose for the 1979 season. That year, he saw his lowest time on the field and he retired at the end of the season. Coaching career With his retirement from playing, Calloway became a full-time coach, a job he would remain with for the next thirty years. As previously mentioned, he held his first head coaching position with the Southern California Lazers of the ASL during 1978, its only season in existence. When he retired from the Earthquakes in 1979, he then held various assistant coaching positions before being selected for his second head coaching position with the California Surf of the NASL. The team hired him in 1981 to replace Peter Wall. However, the Surf lasted only to the end of the 1981 season before folding. Two years later, on 14 March 1983, the Seattle Sounders (NASL) hired Calloway as their new head coach. For the third time in his career, he was the head coach for a team in its last year in existence. Calloway took the team to a 12‚Äì18 record and third place in the Western Division. The Sounders folded at the end of the 1983 season, then the NASL collapsed at the end of the 1984 season. However, Peter Bridgwater, owner of the Earthquakes entered the Earthquakes in the Western Soccer Alliance, a loose collection of previously unaffiliated amateur and semi-pro \\"super clubs\\". Bridgwater hired Calloway who took the Earthquakes to a 4‚Äì1‚Äì2 record and the alliance title. That was the best the Earthquakes did until it folded after the 1988 season. That season the Earthquakes finished third in the alliance, its best finish since the 1985 season. With the collapse of the Earthquakes, the WSA awarded a new Bay Area team, the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks in 1989. In 1991, the Blackhawks hired Calloway as the team's second head coach. He then took the Blackhawks to the 1991 APSL championship. That victory put the Blackhawks into the 1992 CONCACAF Champions' Cup. Under Calloway's direction, the Blackhawks went to the semifinals, only to lose to Club Am√©rica on a 4‚Äì3 aggregate. Calloway coached the Blackhawks through the end of the 1992 season. The 1992 season was also characterised by antagonism between Calloway and a young forward by the name of Eric Wynalda. The feud between the two culminated when Wynalda launched into a tirade against Calloway after he was subbed out of a game. Calloway kicked Wynalda off the team and Wynalda left the US for Germany two weeks later. The announcement of the formation of a new US division one league, Major League Soccer, Peter Bridgwater became instrumental in the formation of a new San Jose franchise. On 7 December 1995, he signed Calloway as the first head coach of the new team, the San Jose Clash. Ironically, given the problems Calloway had with Wynalda during their time together with the Blackhawks, the club signed Wynalda on 23 January 1996. The team continued to sign previous Blackhawks players, including Paul Bravo, John Doyle and Troy Dayak. While Calloway took these players to great success with the Blackhawks, he failed with the Clash. On 6 April 1996, the team began with a bang, it won the first game in league history on a goal by Wynalda, also the league's first. However, the team finished the season at 15‚Äì17 and the 1997 season went even worse. Eric Wynalda again became a source of friction with Calloway. At one point Wynalda hired an aeroplane to tow a banner demanding the team fire Calloway. Calloway also made numerous line-up changes which prevented the team from developing cohesive play. On 25 June 1997, midway through the season, Bridgwater had enough and fired Calloway. He left the team with a 21‚Äì29 record. Calloway then moved to the US Fourth Division club Des Moines Menace. In 2002, Calloway was league Coach of the Year when he took the Menace to an undefeated regular season record. On 18 November 2002, Calloway resigned from Des Moines to take job with expansion US second division club Syracuse Salty Dogs. The team lasted only two seasons (2003 and 2004) before folding in October 2004. Calloway took the team to a 26‚Äì20‚Äì10 record in its two seasons. Two months later, on 14 December 2004, the Rochester Raging Rhinos, also a second division club, named Calloway as the club's new coach. On 23 October 2006, the Rhinos signed Calloway to three-year extension of his contract. In 2008, he officially resigned as head coach of the Rhinos. During an 18 November 2009 press conference, the Des Moines Menace named Calloway the PDL Head Coach and Menace Academy's Director of Coaching. This is Calloway's second stint with the USL Premier Development Club. Owner of the Menace Kyle Krause had the following to say about Calloway, \\"It's exciting to bring back Laurie. I have a tremendous amount of respect for him. It's a unique opportunity to bring back a coach who's coached and played at the highest level in the United States.\\" On 20 July 2012, the Des Moines Menace announced that they would not renew Calloway's contract. Team owner, Kyle Krause, said, \\"To keep up with the ever-growing changes within our Menace programs, we have decided to move the Menace in a different direction with the structure of our PDL coaching roles and Laurie Calloway's contract will not be renewed\\".Menace leadership on the move References External links *NASL stats * Category:Living people Category:American Soccer League (1933‚Äì1983) players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:English footballers Category:English football managers Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer managers in the United States Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) coaches Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players Category:Rochdale A.F.C. players Category:San Jose Earthquakes (1974‚Äì1988) players Category:Seattle Sounders (1974‚Äì1983) coaches Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Southern California Lazers players Category:Southport F.C. players Category:USL First Division coaches Category:Western Soccer Alliance coaches Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:York City F.C. players Category:1945 births Category:Association football defenders Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:English expatriate footballers ","title":"Laurie Calloway"},{"id":"10965221","text":"Brian Gale Robison (born April 27, 1983) is a former American football defensive end.

He had sacks in 5 consecutive games that started in week 11 at Seattle and ended against the Philadelphia Eagles in week 15. In the week 2 loss at the Chicago Bears, he scored his first career touchdown when he recovered a fumble from Jay Cutler which was forced by Jared Allen and returned it 61 yards. The play was the third-longest fumble recovery by a Vikings defensive lineman. 2014 season Robison started all 16 games for the third time in his career and tallied 4.5 sacks on the year, with all of those coming in an 8-week span.

The team has mainly played in the second tier of Bolivian football. In 2004 it came under the ownership of Emilio Alave and the team started to mount a serious promotion challenge, coming close in 2007 when they lost to Aurora in the relegation play-off. Nacional bounced back the following year and won the Copa Simon Bol√≠var, gaining promotion to the first division. In 2009 Nacional made its debut in the Liga de F√∫tbol Profesional Boliviano, but the club couldn't survive its first season and was relegated. In 2010, Wilfredo Condori took over as chairman and the side won both the Copa Simon Bol√≠var and promotion back to the first division. The club played its first ever Copa Sudamericana in 2014. They lost 1-3 on aggregate to Club Libertad of Paraguay in the first round Celebrating its diamond anniversary in 2017, the side was playing in the first division and the Copa Sudamericana for just the second time in their history. Stadium The club plays its home games at Estadio V√≠ctor Agust√≠n Ugarte in Potos√≠. It has a capacity for 32,000 people. The stadium was originally called Estadio San Clemente, but was renamed Mario Mercado Vaca Guzm√°n after some modifications on the structure, including new illumination towers, were made. Newer modifications led ultimately to its actual name. Located 4,090 metres above sea level, the stadium is one of the highest in the world. It has raised numerous controversies in footballing circles, as its significant altitude affects the absorption of oxygen in the human body, offering considerable advantage to the home team who are more accustomed to such conditions.

([http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1FXK more details...]) Prefoldin is a family of proteins used in protein folding complexes. It is classified as a heterohexameric molecular chaperone in both archaea and eukarya, including humans. A prefoldin molecule works as a transfer protein in conjunction with a molecule of chaperonin to form a chaperone complex and correctly fold other nascent proteins. One of prefoldin's main uses in eukarya is the formation of molecules of actin for use in the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Purpose and Uses Prefoldin is one family of chaperone proteins found in the domains of eukarya and archaea. Prefoldin acts in combination with other molecules to promote protein folding in cells where there are many other competing pathways for folding.‚ÄúOxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.‚Äù Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997. Chaperone proteins perform non-covalent assembly of other polypeptide-containing structures in vivo. They are implicated in the folding of most other proteins. In archaea, prefoldins are believed to function in combination with group II chaperoninsClark, D. S., Whitehead, T.A., et al.. (2007). A filamentous molecular chaperone of the prefoldin family from the deep-sea hyperthermophile Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. Protein Science, 16:626-634. in de novo protein folding. In eukarya however, prefoldins have acquired a more specific function: they are used to establish correct tubular assembly for many tubular proteins, such as actin.Cowan, N. J., Vainberg, I.E., Lewis, S.A., et al.. (1998). Prefoldin, a Chaperone that Delivers Unfolded Proteins to Cytosolic Chaperonin. Cell, Vol. 93:863-873. Actin accounts for 5-10% of all protein found in eukaryotic cells, which therefore means that prefoldin is quite prevalent in the cells. Actin is made of two strings of beads wound round each other and is one of the three main parts of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells.Fruton, Joseph S.: ‚ÄúProtein, Enzymes, Genes; The interplay of chemistry and Biology.‚Äù Yale University Press, New Haven, 1999. Prefoldin bonds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin protein. This complex of prefoldin and chaperonin then forms molecules of actin in the cytosol. The prefoldin acts as a transporter molecule that transports bound, unfolded target proteins to the chaperonin (C-CPN) molecule. For example, the prefoldin that is used in the formation of actin also transfers Œ± or Œ≤ tubulin to a cytosolic chaperonin. The prefoldin, however, does not form a ternary complex with tubulin and chaperonin. Once the tubulins are in contact with the chaperonin, the prefoldin automatically lets go and leaves the active site, due to its high affinity for the chaperonin molecule. Once the prefoldin is in contact with the chaperonin protein, it loses its affinity for the unfolded target protein. Prefoldin is triggered only to bind to nonnative target proteins in the cytosol so that it will only bind to unfolded proteins. Unlike many other molecular chaperones, prefoldin does not use chemical energy, in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to promote protein folding.Pockley, A.: ‚ÄúMolecular Chaperones and Cell Signaling.‚Äù Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005. Discovery Prefoldin was found by the laboratory of Nicholas J. Cowan from the Department of Biochemistry at the New York University Medical Center. It was discovered using chromatography. Unfolded labeled Œ≤-actin from bovine testes was put into solution. This solution contained an excess of cytosolic chaperonin (C-CPN), a eukaryotic chaperone protein necessary for actin folding. After gel filtration of the actin, the actin complex, consisting of actin and its bonded proteins, began to form and the molecular weight of the complex was observed. Gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the protein complex, the complex formed a single band that was excised and ran on an SDS gel. It resolved into five bands, therefore proving that a heterooligomeric protein is used to bind to unfolded actin. The discovery paper was published on May 29, 1998 in the journal Cell. The laboratory of Ulrich Hartl at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Martinsried, Germany, has identified an archaeal homolog of prefoldin that also functions as a molecular chaperone.Leroux M.R., et al.. (1999). MtGimC, a novel archaeal chaperone related to the eukaryotic chaperonin cofactor GimC/prefoldin. EMBO J., Vol. 18:6730-6743. Eukaryotic prefoldin likely evolved from archaea, as it is not present (or has been lost) from bacteria. Structure Prefoldin is a hetero hexameric protein consisting of two Œ± subunits and four Œ≤ subunits. The structure of the archaeal homologue was first solved by Siegert et al..Siegert, R., Leroux, M. R., Scheufler, C., Hartl, F. U., and Moarefi, I. (2000). Structure of the molecular chaperone prefoldin: unique interaction of multiple coiled coil tentacles with unfolded proteins. \\"Cell\\", \\"vol. 103\\": 621-632. Another archaeal prefoldin structure was then published by Clark et al.. The beta subunits contain 120 amino acid residues each, while the Œ± subunits contain 140 amino acid residues each. Each subunit was found to have a width of 8.4 nm in the archaea Methanococcus thermoautrophicum. The height was calculated at 1.8-2.6 nm. The subunits are arranged by hydrophobic interactions with two Œ≤ barrels at the center and coiled-coil Œ± helices protruding down from them as if it were a jellyfish.

It is written by series creator Hart Hanson and directed by Greg Yaitanes. It introduces the two main characters of the series, Dr. Temperance Brennan (played by Emily Deschanel) and FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (played by David Boreanaz), and their partnership in solving cases involving unidentified human remains. Summary Returning to Washington, D.C., after two months in Guatemala, where she was identifying victims of genocide, renowned forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan is accosted at the airport by an agent from Homeland Security for carrying a human skull in her bag (when the agent grabbed her, Dr Brennan, who is a student of three different martial arts, easily took him down until the gathering security drew their guns on her). Upon the arrival of FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, Brennan is released, which she finds odd and realizes that it was his plot to get her to help him on an FBI case. She refuses to help until Booth promises her full participation in the case. At the crime scene, Brennan and Booth find decomposed human remains with only the bones remaining. Brennan and her assistant, Zack Addy (Eric Millegan), determine the victim is a woman 18 to 22 years old and was a tennis player. Back at the Jeffersonian Institute, Brennan argues with her boss, Dr. Daniel Goodman (Jonathan Adams), for assigning her to work with other federal agencies without consulting her. Inside the Medico-Legal Lab of the Jeffersonian Institute, Brennan examines the victim's remains while her colleagues inquire about the resemblances between themselves and the characters in her new book, Bred in the Bone. Dr. Jack Hodgins (T. J. Thyne), an entomologist, finds that the victim has been in the pond for more than two summers. Hodgins has also found small bone fragments in the silt, which he guesses are rana temporaria or, simply, frog bones. Dr Brennan's best friend Angela Montenegro (Michaela Conlin), a forensic artist who flashed the airport clerk to get his attention when trying to find Brennan to pick her up at the start of the episode, uses a computer program she has developed, called the Angelator, to make a three-dimensional holographic reconstruction of the reassembled skull. The victim is revealed to be Cleo Louise Eller, a missing Senate intern who was rumored to have had an affair with Senator Bethlehem. Brennan wants to confront the Senator but Booth argues that he is not the only suspect. The Senator's aide, Ken Thompson, was Cleo's boyfriend. There is also Cleo's stalker, Oliver Laurier. Booth tells Brennan that they have a major case and that FBI Deputy Director Cullen is going to want to set up a special unit to investigate. To do everything by the book he wants her to stay at her lab; but Brennan coerces Booth into agreeing to let her come with him into the field. Based on the particulates embedded in Cleo's skull, Hodgins determines that Cleo's skull may have been smashed by a sledgehammer on a cement floor with diatomaceous earth. By the distinctive damage done to her finger pads and the way the body was hidden, the team determines that the murderer had put a lot of effort into hiding the body. Hodgins also reveals that Cleo was taking medicine for her depression, while Brennan realizes that the small bones found with Cleo's body are not frog bones but fetal ear bones, indicating Cleo Eller was pregnant. Hodgins, a devout conspiracy theorist, convinces Brennan that they may never find the truth because Senator Bethlehem will impede the investigation. Without telling Booth, Brennan recklessly confronts the Senator. Consequently, Deputy Director Cullen removes Booth from the case, but Brennan refuses to give up. With the help of her fellow scientists, she uncovers evidence that Cleo Eller's boyfriend, Ken Thompson, had killed Cleo because he feared the scandal of Cleo's pregnancy would affect his career negatively. Cultural references Almost every episode of Season 1 contains a popular culture reference to which the character Dr. Temperance Brennan replies with her catch phrase, \\"I don't know what that means\\".Her catch phrase is heard in the pilot episode over the closing credits. In the pilot, Booth references The X-Files: \\"We're Scully and Mulder.\\" Production details Despite the fact that the series is set in Washington, D.C., filming of the pilot and subsequent episodes primarily took place in Los Angeles, California. Footage of Washington, D.C. was shot by the second unit with body doubles. The first scene featuring the characters Angela Montenegro and Dr. Temperance Brennan inside Washington Dulles International Airport was actually shot at Los Angeles Convention Center, while the opening shot of a plane landing was taken from footage filmed at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\\"Pilot\\" audio commentary by Barry Josephson and Hart Hanson, Bones Season 1 DVD. Series creator and writer Hart Hanson describes the murder victim at the center of the episode as a \\"Chandra-Levy- type congressional intern\\". The story alludes to the power of politicians and allowed Hanson to establish the character of Dr. Temperance Brennan, who is driven to find the truth despite the barriers presented by politics. Response The pilot episode of Bones attracted an average of 10.8 million viewers with 6.7% household share and 11% household rating. It was the highest number of viewers Fox has received for a prime-time Tuesday-night drama series premiere since 24 premiered in 2001. Bones finished first among the 18 to 49 years old demographic and in total viewers in its Tuesday 8:00 pm ET time slot. Based on the episode, New York described the show as \\"the best drama of the new network season\\" and a \\"sexed-up variation of all the CSIs\\".Leonard, John, \\"Bodies in Motion\\", New York, December 12, 2005. Retrieved on June 27, 2007. Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly writes that although Bones has a \\"pretty standard Crossing Jordan/CSI-style framework\\", its main attraction is the chemistry between the two lead characters; \\"that old Sam-and-Diane, Maddie-and-David, Mulder-and-Scully opposites-attract stuff never feels standard when it's done right.\\"Flynn, Gillian, \\"Bones\\", Entertainment Weekly, September 9, 2005. Retrieved on June 27, 2007. Similarly, USA Today comments that compared to other crime shows, the show \\"is built on a more traditional and solid foundation: the strength of its characters\\" and \\"what sets Tuesday's Bones premiere apart from the procedural pack are stars Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, as the season's most appealing new crime fighters.\\"Bianco, Robert, \\"The stars flesh out 'Bones'\\", USA Today, September 12, 2005. Retrieved on June 27, 2007. On the other hand, Media Life Magazine says that while Bones has \\"an amazingly clever notion, brilliant even\\", its \\"execution doesn't match the conception\\" and \\"fails to evolve into a gripping series. In fact, it quickly becomes so derivative of so much else on television - especially, strangely, X-Files - that one might even call it bone- headed.\\"Rosen, Steven, \\"'Bones,' from the heap of tired ideas \\", Media Life Magazine, September 13, 2005. Retrieved on June 27, 2007. In the opinion of Variety's Brian Lowry, the pilot lacked originality. He writes: \\"'Bones' aspires to achieve a mix of 'House' and 'X-Files' chic (there's even a reference to Scully and Mulder), but for the most part its playful banter feels forced and the way-cool visual flourishes overly familiar. What's left, then, is another crime procedural with a not-especially-fresh twist, which, admittedly, has proved a surprisingly durable skeleton over which to drape new dramas.\\"Lowry, Brian, \\"Bones\\", Variety, September 11, 2005. Retrieved on June 29, 2007. Music The song played during the funeral scene is \\"Gone\\", from Thirteen Senses's album The Invitation. The song played when Dr. Brennan is re-constructing the skull is \\"Collide\\" (VF) by Howie Day and/or \\"Broken Bridge\\" (VO) by Daughter Darling.

In 1957 it was located at 736-A North La Cienega Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. In 1958, it was relocated across the street to 723 North La Cienega Boulevard where it remained until its closing in 1966. History The gallery was founded in 1957 by the curator Walter Hopps, the artist Edward Kienholz, and the poet Bob Alexander behind an antiques store on La Cienega Boulevard. They called the gallery ‚ÄúFerus‚Äù to honor a person named James Farris who shot himself to death, and was possibly the friend of a friend of Hopps. They spelled the name \\"Ferus\\" because the man who designed the gallery's logo, Robert Alexander (a.k.a. ‚ÄúBaza‚Äù), a collage artist and poet, thought that spelling looked stronger on the page, and Hopps agreed. It is also true that \\"ferus\\" is a word, meaning \\"wild, savage, or rough.\\" It is unclear whether the gallery founders were thinking of this when they named the gallery. In 1958, Kienholz left to concentrate on producing art, and his stake in the gallery was replaced by Irving Blum. Also at this time, Sayde Moss, a wealthy widow, became a silent partner and with her support the gallery moved across the street to 723 N. La Cienega Boulevard.Ealan Wingate, Lisa Kim and Erin Wright, eds., Ferus, Gagosian Gallery, 2002. (p14). Lawrence Weschler, Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees: A Life of the Contemporary Artist Robert Irwin, University of California Press, 1982. (pp45-6). Up until the autumn of 1958, the gallery held twenty shows, but had made hardly any sales. Blum persuaded Hopps to reduce the number of represented artists to fourteen (seven from San Francisco and seven from Los Angeles) and transformed the financial health of the gallery. Under the directorship of Irving Blum from 1958, the gallery exhibited both the West Coast and New York art of the period. It was the first gallery on the West Coast to devote a solo show to Andy Warhol, whom Blum had first met in New York in 1961. Blum also ventured to show other East Coast artists, including Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, and Frank Stella.Peter M. Brant, Irving Blum Interview. Finish Fetish‚Äîa style that emphasized gleaming surfaces‚Äîand Light and Space‚Äîart about perception‚Äîwere other Ferus-bred styles that allowed L.A. to distinguish itself from the rest of the art world.Scott Timberg (January 1, 2012), Galleries fostered the L.A. art scene Los Angeles Times. Artist Ed Ruscha has likened the gallery to a jazz catalog \\"where there are a lot of different voices under the same record label. Each had a very distinctive take on the world and on his work, and so that made it a very vital place to aspire to and to be.\\"Barbara Isenberg (September 22, 2002), An L.A. Art Story Los Angeles Times. From 1960 to 1964, art collector Marcia Simon Weisman hosted monthly proselytizing classes for novice collectors, taught by Blum and Hopps.Bob Colacello (April 1995), The Art of the Deal Vanity Fair. Committed local art collectors such as Robert Rowan, Edwin Janss, Betty Asher, and author Michael Blankfort were loyal clients. Hopps left in 1962 to become curator and, later, director of the Pasadena Art Museum. Ferus closed in 1967 when Blum sought \\"a financial leg up\\" by opening Ferus/Pace with Arne Glimcher, owner of New York's Pace Gallery. That venture lasted less than two years. Blum operated the Irving Blum Gallery until his departure for New York City in 1972 where in partnership with Joseph Helman he opened the BlumHelman Gallery; he returned full-time to Los Angeles in 1998 as a private dealer. From 1965, the offices of the art magazine Artforum were situated above the gallery, before moving to New York City in 1967. Notable exhibitions Wallace Berman and other artists with 2 undercover Vice Squad officers, looking at Wally Hedrick's sculpture Sunflower (1952), during the now-famous LAPD obscenity arrest at Ferus Gallery in 1957.The inaugural exhibition at the Ferus Gallery was Objects on the New Landscape Demanding of the Eye (March 15 - April 11, 1957), a group show including the work of Frank Lobdell, Jay DeFeo, Craig Kauffman, Richard Diebenkorn, John Altoon and Clyfford Still. Sonia Gechtoff was also in that show in addition to being the first artist to have a solo show at Ferus, in 1957.[Hirsch, Faye, \\"Bella Pacifica\\", Art in America, 3-29-11, www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/bella-pacifica/] In 1957, the gallery was temporarily closed after LAPD officers arrested and charged Wallace Berman with obscenity over work in his exhibition. It was his first and last solo show. In July 1962, Andy Warhol: Campbell's Soup Cans was Andy Warhol's first solo pop art exhibition and the first exhibition of the Soup Cans. Five of the canvases sold for $100 each, but Blum bought them back to keep the set intact and bought the 32 paintings for $1000.The Guardian, Jan 23, 2002 Los Angeles artists who had their first solo shows at the gallery included: Wallace Berman (1957), Billy Al Bengston (1958), Ed Moses (1958), Robert Irwin (1959), John Mason (1959), Kenneth Price (1960), Llyn Foulkes (1962), Larry Bell (1962) and Ed Ruscha (1963). Legacy The Los Angeles County Museum of Art organized \\"Late Fifties at the Ferus\\" in 1968, and the Newport Harbor Art Museum organized \\"The Last Time I Saw Ferus\\" in 1976. In 2002, Gagosian Gallery, New York, mounted an exhibition of about 45 sculptures, paintings, drawings and other artworks by 22 artists shown at Ferus during its 10-year lifetime. Assembled by Irving Blum, the show also included Ferus Gallery exhibition announcements by Lichtenstein and others, several art scene photographs taken by Dennis Hopper, and an elaborate, 144-page catalog. In 2007, \\"The Cool School\\" was released, a documentary film about the Ferus Gallery and its eccentric artists. In 2010, the Samuel Freeman gallery in Santa Monica created a replica of the Ferus within its own walls. The exhibition featured the original door that stood at the entrance of the Ferus plus a full-scale re-creation of the gallery's 1960 solo Bengston exhibition.Jessica Gelt (February 16, 2010), Billy Al Bengston re-creates Ferus Gallery at Samuel Freeman Los Angeles Times.

Legal Advisor to the Government) heads the legal system of the executive branch and the public prosecution of the state. The Attorney General advises the government in legal matters, represents the state authorities in court, advises in the preparation of legal memoranda for the government in general and the Justice Minister in particular. Likewise s/he examines and advises upon private member bills in the Knesset. Additionally, the Attorney General is tasked with protecting the rule of law and, as such, entrusted with protecting the public interest from possible harm by government authorities. It is an independent appointed position, one of the most important and influential in the Israeli democracy, and a central institution in the framework of the Israeli legal system. Owing to the common law tradition of the domestic legal system, the duties of the Attorney General are not codified in law and have been born out of precedent and tradition over the years. Duties The Attorney General has four main duties: # Head of the public prosecution system # Representative of the state in all legal proceedings # Chief legal counsel to the government # Representative of the public interest in any legal matter History In 1997 a commission in the chairmanship of the former president of the Israeli supreme court, Meir Shamgar, had been established for examination of the possibilities of the future legislation on the subject of the attorney general, and recommended that the official title of his or her position will be changed from \\"the legal adviser to the government\\" to \\"the chief legal adviser\\" to reflect his responsibility for ensuring the rule of law in all of the arms of government, and not only as an adviser to the government itself in matters of law. Likewise the commission recommended that the adviser will be appointed by the government according to the recommendations of a public commission, that will include five members: a retired judge of the supreme court, a former justice minister or attorney general, a Knesset member who will be chosen by the Constitutional Affairs committee of the Knesset, an attorney who will be chosen by the national council of the Israel Bar Association, and a legal expert in the subjects of civil and criminal law who will be chosen by the heads of the university law schools in Israel ‚Äî in order to ensure the choosing of an appropriate person who possesses the fitting qualifications for the job. This recommendation regarding the selection committee was adopted in August 2000, but the recommendation regarding the title of the position was not adopted. It is customary that the decision whom to select for the legal adviser position out of the list of nominees that the public commission recommended is done by the justice minister whose selection is brought to the approval of the government, which usually approves the appointment. The manner in which the Attorney General carries out the duties assigned to his or her position is derived to a large extent from the personality of the person holding the position. Two of the legal advisers, Aharon Barak and Yitzhak Zamir, who came to the position from academia, were distinguished in the decisiveness that they demonstrated for the guarding of the rule of law in Israel, even when their ideas conflicted with those of the government. Political interference Sometimes political interests, as opposed to the official attitude of respecting the independence of the position, led the government to fill the position of Attorney General with a person who is considered to be less independent and more amenable to special pleading from the government. The most famous example was a scandal in the mid-1990s, relating to the appointment of Roni Bar-On as legal adviser to the government. There were suspicions that the appointment was part of a deal intended to provide leniency for Aryeh Deri in his corruption case. Those events were coined in the media as the \\"Bar-On Hebron affair\\". In light of this, the appointment of Bar-On as the legal adviser was not well received within the judicial community where many also thought him lacking the personality and legal acumen necessary for the job, all of which quickly led to the effective scotching of his appointment when he resigned only one day after taking the oath of office. Other examples are the hurried replacement of Yitzhak Zamir with Yosef Harish in 1986, as Zamir was not willing to accede to the pardoning of those involved in the Kav 300 affair, and Michael Ben-Yair who was widely considered to be a political appointee of the second Rabin cabinet. Criticism The drawbacks of the current situation are: 1\\\\. Undermining of democracy - the public‚Äôs will to achieve its objectives through the representatives is thwarted. 2\\\\. Undermining of governability - legal advisers delay and stop processes and prevent the government from functioning. 3\\\\. Undermining the accountability of the government - the legal adviser precluding a governmental initiative does not carry any responsibility for the minister‚Äôs failure to fulfill his office‚Äôs objectives.

They are usually a result of mutations in genes that are essential for growth or development. Lethal alleles may be recessive, dominant, or conditional depending on the gene or genes involved. Lethal alleles can cause death of an organism prenatally or any time after birth, though they commonly manifest early in development.  History  Punnett square for the agouti gene in mice, demonstrating a lethal recessive allele.Mouse Genomes Informatic Lethal alleles were first discovered by Lucien Cu√©not in 1905 while studying the inheritance of coat colour in mice. The agouti gene in mice is largely responsible for determining coat colour. The wild-type allele produces a blend of yellow and black pigmentation in each hair of the mouse. This yellow and black blend may be referred to as 'agouti' in colour. One of the mutant alleles of the agouti gene results in mice with a much lighter, yellowish colour. When these yellow mice were crossed with homozygous wild-type mice, a 1:1 ratio of yellow and dark grey offspring were obtained. This indicated that the yellow mutation is dominant, and all the parental yellow mice were heterozygotes for the mutant allele. By mating two yellow mice, Cu√©not expected to observe a usual 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio of homozygous agouti to heterozygous yellow to homozygous yellow. Instead, he always observed a 1:2 ratio of agouti to yellow mice. He was unable to produce any mice that were homozygous for the yellow agouti allele. It wasn't until 1910 that W. E. Castle and C. C. Little confirmed Cu√©not's work, further demonstrating that one quarter of the offspring were dying during embryonic development. This was the first documented example of a recessive lethal allele.  Types of lethal allele   Recessive lethals  A pair of identical alleles that are both present in an organism that ultimately results in death of that organism are referred to as recessive lethal alleles. Though recessive lethals may code for dominant or recessive traits, they are only fatal in the homozygous condition. Heterozygotes will sometimes display a form of diseased phenotype, as in the case of achondroplasia. One mutant lethal allele can be tolerated, but having two results in death. In the case of homozygous achondroplasia, death almost invariably occurs before birth or in the perinatal period. Not all heterozygotes for recessive lethal alleles will show a mutant phenotype, as is the case for cystic fibrosis carriers. If two cystic fibrosis carriers have children, they have a 25 percent chance of producing offspring having two copies of the lethal allele, eventually resulting in the death of the child. Another example of a recessive lethal allele occurs in the Manx cat. Manx cats possess a heterozygous mutation resulting in a shortened or missing tail. Crosses of two heterozygous Manx cats result in two-thirds of surviving offspring displaying the heterozygous shortened tail phenotype, and one-third of surviving offspring of normal tail length that is homozygous for a normal allele. Homozygous offspring for the mutant allele cannot survive birth and are therefore not seen in these crosses.  Dominant lethals  Alleles that need only be present in one copy in an organism to be fatal are referred to as dominant lethal alleles. These alleles are not commonly found in populations because they usually result in the death of an organism before it can transmit its lethal allele on to its offspring. An example in humans of a dominant lethal allele is Huntington's disease, a rare neurodegenerative disorder that ultimately results in death. However, because of its late-onset (i.e., often after reproduction has already occurred), it is able to be maintained in populations. A person exhibits Huntington's disease when they carry a single copy of a repeat-expanded Huntington allele on chromosome 4.  Conditional lethals  Alleles that will only be fatal in response to some environmental factor are referred to as conditional lethals. One example of a conditional lethal is favism, a sex-linked inherited condition that causes the carrier to develop hemolytic anemia when they eat fava beans.

It supports both object- oriented and imperative programming paradigms, as well as some simple functional aspects. Distributed under the licence of zlib/libpng, MiniD is free software.  History  MiniD began in June 2006 as an idea for a statically-typed language, much like a stripped-down version of the D programming language. This is the reason for the name \\"MiniD\\". After work began on the compiler, the creator, Jarrett Billingsley, realized just how large a project this language was becoming, and decided to recast the language into something simpler to implement. The result was a Lua-like language with a C-style syntax. Over the next several months, MiniD acquired features from various languages, such as Squirrel-like classes, a D-like module system, and Lua-like collaborative multithreading. On August 1, 2007, after more than thirteen months of planning and programming, version 1.0 of the reference implementation was released. The version 1.0 language specification is frozen. As of June 15, 2009, version 2 of MiniD has been released. Version 2 brings a major reimplementation of most of the library in order to support its own garbage collector rather than relying on the underlying D garbage collector, for better behavior in realtime applications such as games. Version 2 also brings several changes to the language and standard libraries. The development of MiniD was stopped in June 2011 and used as the base for new language called Croc by the same author.  Features  MiniD provides a small but flexible set of data types, similar to that of Lua's or Squirrel's. Unlike Lua, MiniD provides explicit support for object-oriented programming with classes. MiniD also provides a module system and coroutines as core language features, like Lua. MiniD is garbage-collected, with support for first-class functions, closures, and tail recursion. MiniD also tries to be more robust than typical dynamic languages, making it easier to catch bugs sooner. For example, it does not have implicit variable declarations and accessing globals that do not exist throws an error instead of giving a default value (as in Lua). Another very helpful feature is \\"parameter type constraints,\\" which are a way of specifying valid types that function parameters may accept. These checks are still performed at runtime unlike in static languages, but their concise syntax and negligible performance impact make them much more attractive and easy-to-use than similar solutions in other dynamic languages. They can help greatly in catching bugs that would cause functions to malfunction or corrupt data structures if called with unexpected parameter types. A small example is given below.  Example code  The following example code is for MiniD 2. (Note that due to technical limitations, some keywords are not highlighted here, as Wikipedia does not have a source highlighter for MiniD.) Here is the Hello world program in MiniD. module test writeln(\\"Hello, world!\\") Every MiniD source file must begin with a module declaration. For simplicity, the module declaration has been omitted in the rest of the examples. class Test { x = 0 y = 0 this(x, y) { :x = x :y = y } function toString() = format(\\"x = {} y = {}\\", :x, :y) } local t = Test(3, 4) writeln(t) This example shows a simple class with two fields, x and y, which are initialized to 0 by default. The class's constructor, declared with the 'this' keyword, takes two parameters and assigns them to the instance's fields. The syntax \\":x\\" is shorthand for \\"this.x\\", where \\"this\\" is the object upon which a method was called. Just like in Lua or Python, members of \\"this\\" must be accessed explicitly. The class has one method, 'toString', which is called automatically when the object needs to be converted to a string. The somewhat unusual syntax used here is inspired by many functional languages and is shorthand for the following: function toString() { return format(\\"x = {} y = {}\\", :x, :y) } Finally, the class is instantiated by calling it like a function, similarly to Python or Squirrel. When the instance is printed out using 'writeln', the 'toString' method is called, and so this program outputs \\"\\". local a = array.range(1, 11) local b = a.map(\\\\x -> x * x) writeln(b) This example demonstrates some of MiniD's array manipulation abilities. Unlike Lua, MiniD has a separate array type. In this example, an array is created that holds the values 1 through 10 using the 'array.range' function. Then the 'map' method of arrays is used on 'a', and it takes a function literal which returns the square of its parameter. This literal syntax is again inspired by functional languages (such as Haskell) and is shorthand for the following: local b = a.map(function(x) { return x * x }) When 'b' is printed, it shows the first ten squares, that is \\"\\". writeln([x * x for x in 1 .. 11]) This shows a shorter way of achieving the same result, using MiniD's list comprehensions. The syntax is very close to Python's. local a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] local t = { x = 5, y = 10 } local s = \\"hello\\" foreach(i, v; a) writefln(\\"a[{}] = {}\\", i, v) writeln() foreach(i, v; t) writefln(\\"t.{} = {}\\", i, v) writeln() foreach(i, v; s) writefln(\\"s[{}] = {}\\", i, v) This example shows the 'foreach' loop, which can be used to iterate over arrays, tables, and strings as shown here, as well as other types. function countDown(val: int) = coroutine function() { while(val > 0) { yield(null, val) // this is like yielding an index and a value val-- } } foreach(v; countDown(5)) writefln(v) This example shows the use of the 'foreach' loop to iterate over a coroutine. In this way, coroutines can be used as generators. function first(x: arraystring) = x[0] writeln(first([1, 2, 3])) // prints 1 writeln(first(\\"hello\\")) // prints h writeln(first(45)) // error, invalid parameter type 'int' This shows a simple use of parameter type constraints, a way of putting runtime checks on parameters to restrict their allowable types. The 'first' function allows only arrays and strings for its parameter 'x'. The first two print statements work fine, but the third throws an error since integers are not an allowable type for 'x'.

The club won its seventh domestic league title in 2009.  History  The Diables Noirs started as an all-star club drawn from clubs through Bacongo. The town of Brazzaville was divided into two sides, Poto-Pota and Bacongo, and no Bacongo team had beaten the top team from Poto-Poto to win the town championship in over 6 years. The teams were part of the F√©d√©ration Athl√©tique Congolaise (FAC), a group of clubs run by the Catholic mission.  Controversy  The mission kept all proceeds from the team and provided little support to the players. The leaders of teams from Bacongo, who played under the shared sponsorship of Association Sportive de la Mission, told the missionaries they wanted to create their own team of the best players to challenge for the city championship. They chose the name \\"Black Devils\\" after the champions from Belgium, the \\"Red Devils\\". The mission, not in favor of the new team or the new name, refused to recognize the team. The youth in the mission decided to boycott mass, and intimidated others from attending. To quell potential upheaval, colonial authorities agreed to the creation of the team and even allowed a percentage of the funds they generated.  Style of Play  A Frenchman named Aim√© Brun offered to help the team in the role of trainer and adviser. They adopted a short passing game and tighter marking on defense, instead of the traditional British style relying on crosses. With this style, they were finally able to win the city championship against Poto-Poto and go undefeated each year from 1952‚Äì1954.

Background Jonathan Le Billon was born to Keith and Janet Le Billon, at Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. His paternal grandfather moved to the British mainland from the Channel Islands during World War II. At age 4, Le Billon began attending Nora Bray's School of Dance. At age 9 he began attending the Audrey Spencer Theatre School of Dance & Drama (1989-1996). He began his professional acting career at age 13. Le Billon graduated from Greenhead College in Huddersfield, although he was nearly dismissed in his first year because of the demands on his time that his acting activities consumed. He also attended the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School 2004-2007. Early career Le Billon‚Äôs first television appearance was in 1997, in a guest role on the ITV series Heartbeat. This was followed by guest roles in: City Central (BBC) and Cold Feet (Granada). His first leading role was in the Renaissance season of How We Used to Live playing the role of Tom Byngham, after which he returned to college to graduate. Following on from this, Le Billon took leading roles in the Channel 4 show Hollyoaks, and the Emmy nominated series At Home with the Braithwaites, and between the two, shot over 100 episodes of series television from 1998 through 2001. He also toured for a year with the Northern Broadsides theatre company before gaining a coveted place on the 3 yr B.A. course at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. At drama school Le Billon played several roles, including 'Jaques' in the school‚Äôs international tour of As You Like It. He graduated with a B.A. in July 2007, and after graduation, worked for the Northcott Theatre, Exeter, on their National tour of Richard III (2008), receiving a notable mention for his performance in the role of 'Catesby'. He was then used as 'Robert Juet' in the New York run of the play River of Tides (2009). Early work in the U.S. In 2010, Le Billon took roles in two film projects: Casting Shadows (2011), an adaptation of a Korean folk tale, and the feature film Bright in the Dark (2011). He was also cast for the title role in the Lewis Family Playhouse‚Äôs production of The Gingerbread Man. A significant boost to his profile came with a role opposite Oscar-nominated actor Robert Loggia in the feature film The Apostle Peter (2012), as well as several international commercial campaigns, including as spokesperson for Corning Glassware. Le Billon also continued with theatrical works, appearing in stage productions of: Amadeus, The Chronicles of Narnia and as 'The Engineer' in Miss Saigon (all for the San Bernardino Playhouse). Physical theatre projects included the technically challenging roles of Vaslav Nijinsky in Eleanor Antin's Before the Revolution (Billy Wilder Theatre), and 'The Creature' in Theatrical Arts International's production of Nick Dear's Frankenstein (2014).

He announced his retirement on 26 October 2013 and took charge of the 2013 Currie Cup Final between and the as his final domestic league match as referee. His final test match as a referee was on 16 November 2013 when he took charge of the Namibia v Kenya match in the final fixture of the 2013 Namibian Tri-Nations in Windhoek. Background Kaplan was born in Durban to Jewish parents, and was educated at Carmel College, Durban, and King David School, Linksfield, Johannesburg. He gained a bachelor of social sciences degree, with majors in economics and psychology, from the University of Cape Town and a postgraduate degree in marketing management from the University of South Africa. Refereeing career Kaplan began refereeing in 1984, while still a high school student. He made his first-class debut in 1991 and was appointed to South Africa's national panel of referees in 1993. On 4 May 1996 he made his international debut in a match between Namibia and Zimbabwe in Harare. He was appointed as a touch judge for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, and as a referee for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, where he took charge of three pool games and the quarter-final between France and Ireland. He was one of the twelve referees appointed to officiate at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, and took charge of four pool games and the semi-final between England and France, and also at the 2011 Rugby World Cup where he refereed Tonga v Canada, Canada v Japan, England v Georgia & Ireland v Italy, he was also an Assistant Referee in the Semi-final between Wales & France. Jonathan become the first South African to officiate at four World Cups, and referee at three. Some of Kaplan's other notable games in charge include the first ever game in the Six Nations Championship, between Italy and Scotland in 2000, the second test between the British and Irish Lions and Australia in 2001 and the third test between the Lions and New Zealand in 2005. Kaplan was the referee for the 2005 Super 12 final and the 2006 Super 14 final (a game notorious for the dense fog which obscured much of the action from spectators and commentators). In December 2008 he was chosen as one of nine referees on a merit panel who, it was intended, would between them have charge of 75% of 2009 Super 14 matches irrespective of the nationality of the teams involved. In line with this policy, Kaplan was appointed to referee the 2009 Super 14 Final; in previous years he would have been debarred from officiating because of the involvement of a South African team. In late 2009, he was again named on the merit panel for the 2010 Super 14. In October 2008 he took charge of the final of South Africa's premier domestic competition, the Currie Cup, for the fourth time, and was the referee again for the 2009 final. On 12 February 2013, Kaplan announced his retirement from refereeing as of the end of the season. Records Kaplan was previously the most experienced Test referee of all time: he became the first referee to reach the milestone of 50 Test matches when he refereed the Scotland-Ireland game during the 2009 Six Nations Championship, and has since increased his total to 70 Tests (as at his retirement).. As at August 2019 the record is now 89, held by Nigel Owens. He also holds the record for refereeing the most Tests involving a single team: the New Zealand-Wales game in June 2010 was his 17th involving the host nation (ending up in 18), surpassing the record of 16 matches previously held jointly by Welshman Derek Bevan (also refereeing New Zealand) and New Zealander Paul Honiss (refereeing Australia). Other refereeing records held by Kaplan are: most Bledisloe Cup matches (8); most Tri Nations matches (8); most Six Nations matches (18); only referee to have participated in four British and Irish Lions tours and to have had charge of matches in all three tour countries (Free State v B&I; Lions, South Africa 1997; 2nd Test, Australia 2001; 3rd Test, New Zealand 2005; Sharks v B&I; Lions, South Africa 2009). Kaplan also holds South African refereeing records for most Rugby World Cup appearances (4: 1999 (as a touch judge), 2003, 2007, 2011) and most World Cup games (13 ‚Äì 5 as a touch judge) most Super 14 games (107, including 3 finals and 4 semi-finals); and most Currie Cup matches (161, including 6 finals and 4 semi-finals); and is the only referee to have won the award as South African Referee of the Year for four years in succession (2003‚Äì07)and 5 overall .

It is undeveloped and rarely visited, lacking roads and being off the usual tourist tracks, but this may change in the future. Description Like most national parks in Zambia, it is unfenced allowing free movement of the animals, and it is surrounded by buffer zones where hunting is regulated, called Game Management Areas (GMAs). The West Zambezi GMA adjacent to the park is the largest in the country at 35,000 square kilometres. The park occupies part of large plain lying between the Zambezi, the Cuando River (the upper Chobe River), and the Caprivi Strip, called the Silowana Plains, lying south of the Barotse Floodplain. They were once part of the Kalahari Desert and covered in wind-blown sand-dunes, still present as gentle undulations and a sandy soil. Although the climate is now wetter, permanent rivers do not flow through the plains, only a few seasonal ones, and in the rainy season thousands of small lagoons, typically a couple of hundred metres across, form in the depressions between the dunes. Two ecoregions are well represented in the park, Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands dominated by Zambian Teak trees, which surrounds plains of Western Zambezian grasslands. Along the major rivers surrounding the park is a third ecoregion, Zambezian flooded grasslands. Fauna The Park and surrounding GMA form an important link in the migratory route of elephants and wildebeest from the nearby national parks of Botswana and Namibia. Although still poached, the park does offer a better refuge for elephants migrating from Angola where poaching and illegal hunting has been rampant during and in the aftermath of the civil war there. The park is home to over 3,000 African bush elephants, and roan antelope, sable antelope, puku, impala, Grant's zebra, and kudu. Several endangered species including Cape wild dog and South African cheetah are also present. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa. Tourism There are no facilities except for campsites and no roads in the park, only tracks requiring four-wheel drive vehicles even in the dry season, when vehicles can become bogged in sand. In 2007 several tour operators were taking guided safaris into the park. According to the Zambian government plans are in hand to open the park to private management and provide better wildlife protection. The proximity to Angola, Namibia and Botswana makes it ripe for transfrontier parks initiatives. Other tourism facilities have recently been developed or are planned in the region, such as along nearby stretches of the Zambezi (a fishing resort, and a lodge at Ngonye Falls), and in the Caprivi Strip. The recently opened Trans‚ÄìCaprivi Highway and Katima Mulilo Bridge are within 60 km of the park and may increase visitor numbers appreciably. Notes This park is considered for inclusion in the 5 Nation Kavango - Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.

H. Richardson. From 1885 to 1996, it housed the Malden Public Library, which now occupies a modern building adjacent to it. The former library is located at 36 Salem Street, Malden, Massachusetts. The building was a gift of Elisha S. and Mary D. Converse in memory of their murdered son, Frank Eugene Converse, who was the victim of the first bank robbery/murder in North America. It was constructed 1883-1885 in an overall L-shape, with a facade of brown Longmeadow sandstone, a tower rising from the L's inner corner, and a heavily arched entry porch set within the L's short arm. The main library room is 50 x 36 feet and finished in elaborately carved white oak with a high, vaulted ceiling. Its furniture was designed by Richardson and manufactured by the Boston firm of A. H. Davenport and Company. In 1896 two additions were made to the building, designed by Richardson's successor firm, Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge. One gable-roofed wing extends the building to the rear, along Park Street, following the same general lines of the existing structure. The other addition was a flat-roofed rectangular stack area also attached to the rear. An octagonal gallery space further extended the rear in 1916, designed by Newhall and Blevins. The Converse Memorial Building was the last of Richardson's library designs, and is generally considered among his finest works. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

Some parts were filmed in Adelaide, Australia. Initially the film was supposed to release on 21 December 2007 but got postponed to 4 July 2008 due to extensive post-production work. The premiere was held on 2 July 2008 in London. The film draws a lot of similarity to the 1991 Telugu film Aditya 369; while the Telugu film dealt with travel to the past as well as dystopian post-apocalyptic future, Love Story 2050 was exclusively about travelling to a utopian future-city of Mumbai in the year 2050. It is the first utopian time travel film of Bollywood. The movie was released on 4 July 2008 and performed poorly at the box office. Plot Karan Malhotra is a spirited and happy-go-lucky boy who does not follow the rules. Sana is the opposite of Karan: a sweet and shy girl who lives life by the rules. Even though they are completely opposite, they fall in love, leading to a magical love story. A scientist, Dr. Yatinder Khanna, has dedicated 15 years of his life to building a time machine. Sana expresses a wish to time-travel to Mumbai in the year 2050, but she is killed in an accident before her marriage to Karan. Karan wishes to travel back in time and find Sana. Dr. Yatinder, Karan, and Sana's siblings, Rahul and Thea, travel forward in time and reach Mumbai in 2050. They are fascinated by the futuristic Mumbai, with its flying cars, holograms, robots, 200-story buildings and more. Twists and turns lead to the introduction of Ziesha, the reincarnation of Sana. Ziesha is a popular singer in 2050 who does not remember her past life, but gets flashbacks of it after meeting Karan. Unlike Sana, Ziesha is an arrogant, headstrong and rebellious girl who does not believe in love. She leads a lonely life after the death of her parents, which has embittered her. Karan and the others find themselves under the threat of the demi-god, Dr. Hoshi. After Karan tells Ziesha he loves her, he is taken away from her by the guards. Ziesha does not believe him when he tells her about his time travel. However, after reading Sana's diary, Ziesha ultimately remembers her past life. Karan returns to her and she declares her love for him and tells him she is Sana. Dr. Hoshi tries to capture Karan because he wants the time machine. After a wild attempt to catch Karan and Ziesha, Hoshi crashes into a nuclear substance truck and dies. Karan goes back to 2008 in the time machine with Ziesha and the rest of his family. Everyone is overjoyed to see their beloved Sana again and Karan proposes to her. Cast  * Harman Baweja as Karan Malhotra * Priyanka Chopra as Sana Bedi/Zaisha * Boman Irani as Professor Yatinder Khanna/Uncle Ya * Aman Batala as Rahul (Sana's younger brother) * Archana Puran Singh as Mrs. Bedi (Sana's mum) * Shishir Sharma as Mr. Bedi (Sana's dad) * Dalip Tahil as Mr Malhotra (Karan's dad) * Kurush Deboo as Jimmy Dhinchuck (hacker) * Harsh Vasishta as Karan's Friend * Mehezabeen Sarela as Sheena Production Initially, when Love Story 2050 was announced in 2004, Kareena Kapoor had signed on to play Priyanka's role, for which she was reportedly paid Rs.30 million. Kapoor later opted out in 2006 saying she had some date problems and was replaced by Chopra. Love Story is Bollywood's first futuristic film and had 1200 special effect shots The budget ‚Äì Rs.600 million ‚Äì was high for an Indian movie that time. The special effects were executed by four international firms. Two special effects houses ‚Äî Weta Workshop (New Zealand) and John Cox (Brisbane, Australia) ‚Äî have won an Academy Award for their work on international projects. Along with lead actors, Harman and Priyanka, a robot was seen playing a major role; viewers also get to see a teddy bear which appears to be more than a toy. Lead actress Priyanka Chopra played a double role so she coloured her hair twice: once red to portray the girl from future and then again black. The red-haired look is inspired from Harman Baweja's sister Rowena Baweja's painting which portrays woman of today and tomorrow. The script of Love Story 2050 inspired her to do the painting. The first trailer of the film was shown on 21 March 2008 at the premiere of Race. Release The film released on 4 July 2008 with 540 plus prints (including 200 digital screens) and approximately 200 prints overseas. Reception Taran Adarsh of Indiatimes called Harman the new flavour of the season and someone who will have a long stay in Bollywood.. Raja Sen of Rediff.com called the movie \\"absolutely ridiculous\\" with \\"nothing to offer\\". In reference to Harman Baweja, Sen said \\"He cannot act. He does not look good. He does not have screen presence\\". It was a critical failure with many adding it on their worst movies lists as well as Priyanka and Harman's \\"worst film\\" lists. Professor Shiju Sam Varughese, Coordinator of the Centre for Studies in Science, Technology and Innovation Policy at the Central University of Gujarat, did offer that the film's utopian version of Mumbai helps \\"understand the cultural anxieties about India‚Äôs neoliberal future\\". * The film won the award for Best Special Effects at 54th Filmfare Awards. Box office The film failed to generate a big initial response and the bookings for the sci-fi release were tepid at best, garnering only about 25%-30% advance bookings. Love Story 2050 opened to a 25% response and, by noon shows, was in the 35%-40% range. In multiplexes, it opened to a 50%-60% response on Friday. The film was released on 725 cinemas including 350 digital cinemas. The film crashed all around in week two, thus an average in India and overseas. Most call it a trade disaster because it could not retrieve the cost of its budget, making Adlabs lose over . DVD and CD, telecast on television Harry Baweja has plans to release the movie on DVD and has sold the DVD rights for a huge price. The DVD pack will include videos on the making of Love Story 2050 and its special effects. PC game Rocking Pixels in co-ordination with undisclosed USA-based firms is developing a game based on the film. The game was to be released sometime in June at an expected price point of around Rs200; after the movie's failure, the release date of the game has been extended. This concept follows other Bollywood-based video games such as Dhoom 2 and Ghajini.. Soundtrack The music was composed by Anu Malik. The lyrics were by Javed Akhtar.

Dr Moloney took charge of the expedition for a few weeks when its military officers were dead or incapacitated by illness, and wrote a popular account of it, With Captain Stairs to Katanga: Slavery and Subjugation in the Congo 1891‚Äì92, published in 1893.Joseph A. Moloney: With Captain Stairs to Katanga: Slavery and Subjugation in the Congo 1891‚Äì92. Sampson Low, Marston & Company, London, 1893 (reprinted by Jeppestown Press, ) Early career Born Joseph Augustus Moloney in Newry, Ireland, in 1857, he studied at Trinity College Dublin and St Thomas's Hospital, London. He practised medicine in South London, and was a sportsman and yachtsman, with a taste for adventure, and was said to be 'hard as nails'. He served as a military doctor in the First Boer War in South Africa, and as medical officer on an expedition to Morocco, returning in 1890. website accessed 29 April 2007. On the strength of this, he was appointed by the Canadian mercenary Captain William Stairs as one of five Europeans on his well-armed mission with 336 African askaris and porters to take possession of Katanga for Leopold's Congo Free State, with or without Msiri's consent.Moloney, 1893: p9. With Captain Stairs to Katanga The expedition took a year for the round trip from their base in Zanzibar to Msiri's capital at Bunkeya, where they stayed nearly two months. They suffered disease, starvation for a while, and numerous hardships. A quarter of the Africans and two out of the five Europeans died, including Captain Stairs, but Moloney was spared any severe illness. In Bunkeya, Msiri refused to sign a treaty accepting Leopold's sovereignty and the CFS flag, and was killed by second officer Omer Bodson who had recklessly confronted Msiri in a situation which he, Bodson, could not control. Msiri's people and his successor as chief, seeing the expedition's greater firepower, bowed to the inevitable and signed the treaty.Moloney, 1893: Chapter XI. Katanga became part of Leopold's Congo Free State, which achieved later notoriety thanks to the treatment of the Congolese citizens. Moloney's book has a significant omission. As evidence of Msiri's 'barbarity', it notes that he placed the heads and skulls of executed enemies and miscreants on poles and the palisades of his boma. An article in French was published in Paris around the same time as Moloney's book in which Moloney's colleague on the expedition, the Marquis Christian de Bonchamps, revealed that after killing him, they cut off Msiri's head and hoisted it on a pole in plain view as a 'barbaric lesson' to his people.Ren√© de Pont-Jest: L'Exp√©dition du Katanga, d'apr√®s les notes de voyage du marquis Christian de BONCHAMPS, in: Edouard Charton (editor): Le Tour du Monde magazine, also published bound in two volumes by Hachette, Paris (1893). Available online at www.collin.francois.free.fr/Le_tour_du_monde/ Moloney's character Moloney was in the main conventional in his approach to his job as expedition medical officer, and loyal to his commander and employer. At times he wrote appreciatively of many of the Africans on the expedition, particularly 'chief' (meaning supervisor) Hamadi-bin-Malum and some of the Zanzibari askaris and porters. He also went against the conventional wisdom in the colonial service by noting the decency and humanity of many of the Arabs in East and Central Africa, opining that they had a much better relationship with the Bantu people than his colleagues would admit.Moloney, 1893: pp.69, 70, 121‚Äì2. As a doctor, Moloney treated African villagers who were brought to him as much as his medical stores would allow. On the other hand, in his writing Moloney was untroubled by any notion that the killing of Msiri might have been unjustified or that the seizing of Katanga for Leopold was theft of territory. He wrote that Msiri was a bloodthirsty tyrant and despot from whose rule the local people had been liberated by the expedition, and that Bodson had killed Msiri in self-defence.Moloney, 1893: pp.vi, 190. He did address the point that as British subjects in the King of Belgium's service, he and Stairs might come into armed conflict with competing British interests (the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes). He wrote that in this eventuality they would discharge their duties to their employer, but he did not consider what other British people might think of this.Moloney, 1893: pp.11, 131, 208. Moloney did not think of Belgium as a serious rival to the British Empire, unlike France, Germany or Portugal.Moloney, 1893: p.12. Moloney's obituary in The Times of London described him as 'very valiant' and credited his leadership of the expedition, while Captain Stairs was ill and after the death of Bodson, with consolidation of control of Katanga and construction of a strong fort, enabling the following Belgian relief expeditions to establish firm control.The Times: \\"Obituary of Dr. Joseph Moloney, L.R.C.P.I., Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society, An Explorer\\". London, 7 October 1896. After Katanga On return to London, Moloney lectured and wrote papers on the geography of the expedition's route, and was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He resided in New Malden, south-west London. In 1895, Dr Moloney returned to central Africa with an expedition, this time with the British South Africa Company (which had been his competitor in the Stairs Expedition) to negotiate treaties with African chiefs in North-Eastern Rhodesia. This was a more peaceful expedition than the Stairs Expedition, and was fairly successful, except in the case of Mpeseni, the Ngoni chief based near what is now Chipata. The Ngoni were of Zulu origin with a similar warrior tradition. Moloney spent two days there with Mpeseni, but left empty-handed. (Two years laterm Mpeseni and his warriors went to war against the British but were defeated). Perhaps because of his later service for the BSAC, or perhaps because his role was considered subordinate, Dr Moloney's reputation does not seem to have been subject to the same hostility that the British in Northern Rhodesia later directed towards the reputation of Captain Stairs for claiming Katanga for the Belgians. Joseph Moloney returned to south-west London but did not have time to enjoy his status as a celebrated explorer: he died at the age of 38, and is buried in Kingston Cemetery in Kingston upon Thames.

The two-day competition was inaugurated in 2007 and is named after Arsenal's main sponsor, Emirates. It has been held every summer except 2012 due to the London Olympics, 2016 because of pitch renovation work and 2018 because of stadium building work. The competition in its first decade followed a point scoring system much like the Amsterdam Tournament, whereby each team played two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a loss. An additional point is awarded for every goal scored; this was scrapped in 2011, but made a return from the 2013 edition. From 2009, total shots on target throughout the tournament has been used as a tiebreaker if teams are tied on points, goal difference and goals scored. Since 2019, the Emirates Cup has been shortened to a one-day tournament with the inclusion of Arsenal Women. Arsenal won the inaugural tournament in 2007, and further wins followed in 2009, 2010, 2015, and most recently 2017. Five other sides have won the Emirates Cup: Hamburg in 2008, New York Red Bulls in 2011, Galatasaray in 2013, Valencia in 2014 and Lyon in 2019. Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain are the most regular guests, both having been invited to compete in the tournament on three occasions; Lyon won the tournament and finished as runners-up once, while PSG finished as runners-up twice. History Arsenal first announced their intention to stage a pre-season competition at their home ground, the Emirates Stadium, in March 2007. Managing director Keith Edelman revealed plans were at an exploratory stage, and added: \\"It would be in pre-season, around late July, and tickets would be reasonably priced. We feel it could be a really exciting event.\\" Details of the tournament were formally announced on 1 May 2007, with Italian champions Inter Milan, French side Paris Saint-Germain and German outfit Hamburg confirmed as participants. Hamburg's qualification into the Intertoto Cup meant they withdrew from the competition; the club were subsequently replaced by Spain's Valencia. alt=A near-capacity crowd watch Arsenal play Real Madrid on the second and final day of the pre-season tournament. The inaugural Emirates Cup took place on 28 July and 29 July 2007 and was well attended with over 110,000 people filling the stadium across the two-day tournament. Each club played two sides; Valencia and Arsenal did not face each other, and Inter did not play against Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal won the first tournament, having beaten their French opponents 2‚Äì1 and defeated Inter by the same scoreline, courtesy of a late Robin van Persie strike. The following year Hamburg made an appearance alongside Real Madrid and Juventus, and won the tournament as they finished two points clear of second-place Real. In 2009, Arsenal welcomed Atl√©tico Madrid, Rangers and Paris Saint-Germain to the Emirates Cup. The hosts regained the trophy winning both of their matches and scoring five goals; midfielder Jack Wilshere was twice named man of the match for his performances against Atl√©tico Madrid and Rangers. Arsenal retained the Emirates Cup in 2010, but failed to top the table in the next three tournaments. New York Red Bulls, who were captained by former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, won the Emirates Cup in 2011, after beating Paris Saint-Germain and drawing with the hosts. The tournament did not take place in 2012 due to the ongoing Summer Olympics in London; it was believed that the capital's infrastructure was not able to cater for the extra 100,000 supporters that usually attend the two-day event. When the Emirates Cup resumed in 2013, Turkish side Galatasaray earned nine points to finish top of the group, and a year later Valencia became the first Spanish winners of the tournament as the hosts lost their decisive game against Monaco. Arsenal claimed their fourth Emirates Cup in 2015; the competition was held on the final weekend of July. The hosts scored seven goals in the tournament ‚Äì six against Lyon, who later became the first team in the competition's history not to score a goal in either of their matches. Note: Compare goals conceded in the 2015 final standings table with other tournaments. Due to the extended schedule of UEFA Euro 2016 and essential pitch reconstruction works at the Emirates Stadium, the Emirates Cup did not take place in the pre-season period of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Two years later, stadium building work meant that once again the tournament did not take place. The Emirates Cup returned in 2019 with Arsenal Women featuring for the first time in the pre-season tournament, where they faced Bayern Munich Women. In the men's tournament, Lyon defeated Arsenal 2‚Äì1 to win their first title.

Although he is sometimes referred to as the youngest of the Lincoln County Regulators, this is almost certainly in error. An error listing his birthday on his gravestone is a primary source of this error, but frequent references to Yginio Salazar as \\"the young Salazar\\" imply that he was among the youngest. In fact, although he was young he was almost certainly older than his friend Billy the Kid. Childhood Salazar was probably born on 14 Feb 1858 (or 1857) in Valencia County, New Mexico. In the 1860 census of Valencia County, he is listed as age 2 in the household as the son of Teofilo and Paula (Paubla) Salazar in the Quara & Cienga area. Also listed in this household are siblings Lugarda (12), Francisco (8), Magencia (6) Romulo (5) and Jos√© (2). This conflicts with the popularly cited birth year of 1863 (and the year on his gravestone), but the 1860 census in which he is listed and 1880 census records and the age distribution of siblings make a birth year after 1860 impossible. His father Teofilo evidently died and his mother remarried prior to 1880. Yginio is listed in the 1880 census of Las Tablas, Lincoln County as a stepson in the family of Francisco and Paula Luma, along with his brothers Romulo and Jos√©, also listed in the 1860 Valencia County census. The older siblings had either died or left the household by 1880. He grew up on the Hondo River, but his family eventually settled a few miles west of Lincoln. Yginio learned how to play the fiddle when he was little and was hired to play at a dance at Fort Stanton and was paid $50 for doing it. Also, Yginio became a skilled horseman and good with a rifle and pistol. Lincoln County War and beyond Yginio met Billy the Kid, and looked up to him as a role model. The only battle Yginio fought in during the Lincoln County War was the Five-Day Battle and was one of the fourteen Regulators inside the McSween house. When the Regulators had to flee the burning home, he was shot in the back and shoulder and pretended to be dead so he wouldn't be shot again. He crawled to his sister-in-law's house, a half-mile away from Lincoln, and was treated by the Fort Stanton doctor, Dan Appel. Yginio later became an honest rancher. After Billy the Kid escaped from jail in Lincoln, killing his two guards, he fled to Yginio's home where Salazar provided food and water while Billy the Kid camped nearby. Later life Yginio Salazar cannot be located in the 1885 Territorial Census. The 1900 Lincoln, Lincoln County census introduces a mystery regarding the date of Yginio's marriage to Isabel Paniague of Lincoln County. The census lists the household of Yginio Salazar married to Isabel (age 35, born May 1865). A daughter Pilar is listed as age 18, born November, 1881. Isabel is shown to be the mother of one child with that child still living. However, the census also records that Yginio and Isabel have been married only FOUR years (1896). The 1910 Lincoln, Lincoln County census shows Yginio, now age 50 is shown as being married once but Isabel (now age 45) as married twice. The census records show that Isabel was the mother of NO children, and shows that Yginio and Isabel have been married for 12 years (1898). Despite the census note, Yginio Salazar probably married Isabel in Lincoln County between 1896-1898. He was her second husband and they may have had no children together. Yginio spoke both English and Spanish and could read and write. Isabel spoke only Spanish and could not read nor write He continued to farm in Lincoln County until his death on January 7, 1936. He was buried alongside his wife in the Lincoln Cemetery and his headstone still reads \\"Pal of Billy the Kid.\\" References External links * Youngest Regulator story and photos on angelfire.com Category:1863 births Category:1936 deaths Category:American vigilantes Category:Lincoln County Wars ","title":"Yginio Salazar"},{"id":"10965735","text":"Oderwerke or Stettiner Oderwerke was a German shipbuilding company, located in Stettin.

This molecule consists of four methoxy groups bonded to a silicon atom. The basic properties are similar to the more popular tetraethyl orthosilicate, which is usually preferred because the product of hydrolysis, ethanol, is less toxic than methanol. Tetramethyl orthosilicate hydrolyzes to SiO2: :Si(OCH3)4 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí SiO2 \\\\+ 4 CH3OH In organic synthesis, Si(OCH3)4 has been used to convert ketones and aldehydes to the corresponding ketals and acetals, respectively.Sakurai, H. \\"Silicon(IV) Methoxide\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2001 John Wiley & Sons. Safety The hydrolysis of Si(OCH3)4 produces insoluble SiO2 and CH3OH (methanol). Even at low concentrations inhalation causes lung lesions, and at slightly higher concentrations eye contact with the vapor causes blindness. Worse, at low concentrations (200 ppm/15 min) the damage is often insidious, with onset of symptoms hours after exposure. The mode of action is the precipitation of silica in the eyes and/or lungs. Contrary to common information, including several erroneous MSDS sheets, the methanol produced is only a risk through chronic exposure and is a comparatively small concern. The mechanisms of methanol toxicity are well established, methanol causes blindness via conversion to formaldehyde, then to toxic formic acid in the liver; methanol splashes to the eye cause only moderate and reversible eye irritation.

Hennessy joined the team when he replaced Stephen Brenner as first-choice 'keeper in 2005 and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement in 2012. During that time he won two Munster winners' medals and one National League winners' medal. He ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Hennessy plays with Ardmore. Playing career Club Hennessy plays both hurling and Gaelic football with Ardmore. Inter-county Hennessy made his debut for the Waterford senior team during the 2005 National Hurling when he started against Kilkenny. During the subsequent championship campaign he displaced Stephen Brenner as Waterford's first-choice goalkeeper. After a heart-breaking one-point defeat to Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final of 2006, Hennessy collected his first silverware in 2007 in the form of a National Hurling League medal when Waterford defeated Kilkenny by 0-20 to 0-18. He later claimed a first Munster winners' medal as Waterford defeated Limerick by 3-17 to 1-14 in the provincial decider. While Waterford were viewed as possibly going on and winning the All-Ireland title for the first time in almost half a century, Limerick ambushed Waterford in the All-Ireland semi-final. 2008 began poorly for Waterford as the team lost their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this poor start Hennessy's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty-five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to defeat Waterford by 3-30 to 1-13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. Hennessy lined out in a third Munster final in 2010 with Cork providing the opposition. A 2-15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford went on to win the replay after an extra-time goal by Dan Shanahan. It was a second Munster winners' medal for Hennessy. In 2011 Waterford attempted to make their own piece of history by winning back-to-back Munster titles. The game turned into a nightmare as the Tipperary forwards ran riot and put seven goals past Hennessy. Waterford were later defeated by eventual champions Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final.

Originally aired on September 20, 2005 on FOX network, the episode is written by Stephen Nathan and directed by Allan Kroeker. The plot features the investigation of Dr. Temperance Brennan and FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth into a man whose S.U.V. exploded, killing him and several other civilians, and highlights issues about terrorism. Summary After an S.U.V. explodes in front of a busy caf√© in Washington, D.C., forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan is asked to confirm the identity of the SUV's driver as Hamid Masruk, the leader of the Arab-American Friendship League. With the help of her assistant, Zack Addy, Brennan cleans the skeleton and compares the bones to Masruk's medical records. Although she is convinced the victim is Hamid Masruk, Brennan sends Zack to reconstruct the skull. Zack finds that the ethmoid and sphenoid fragments do not fit together, which Brennan suspects is due to a degenerative disease. However, it was not from Paget's disease or Lupus as she had first suspected but from gypsum, an environmental contaminant which Zack and Dr. Jack Hodgins found. They determine that the gypsum found was probably used to insulate the bomb that had exploded. After Brennan finds microscopic fissures in the trabecular pattern of Hamid's skull, Hodgins was able to find the cause - Hamid was exposed to dioxins. Hamid's wife, Sahar, vehemently states that her husband is not a terrorist. Booth suspects that the wife is having an affair, to which Brennan disagrees while her friend, Angela Montenegro, agrees with Booth. Booth finds out the man with whom Sahar was having an affair is Ali Ladjavardi, but he could not have killed Hamid since he was training with Homeland Security during the time when Hamid would have been exposed to the dioxin. When Hodgins and Zack were able to tie the gypsum they found to a type of plaster used in pyrobar, a gypsum-based, fire-proof tile developed in 1903, Booth and Brennan are able to find out the area in which the tile was used and the bomb was built. They realize the home of Hamid's brother, Farid Masruk, is located in that area. However, when they arrive at his house, they find him missing but the insulation used for the explosives is in plain sight. Farid had planned another attack but fails to set off the bomb when Booth and Brennan arrive just in time to stop him. Music The episode featured the following tracks:Bones - Music Season 1 \\\\- * I Turn My Camera On - Spoon * Every ship must sail away - Blue Merle * Shalom - Moonraker * Try - Deep Audio Production details This episode was written and filmed after \\"A Boy in the Tree\\", which was aired as the series' third episode.Production codes for \\"The Man in the S.U.V.\\" and \\"A Boy in the Tree\\" are 1AKY02 and 1AKY01 respectively. According to Stephan Nathan, executive producer and writer of Bones, the episode's main focus is misdirection. The opening scene featuring a Middle Eastern man driving an SUV, which stops in front of a busy caf√© and explodes, is used to cause the audience to assume that the man was a terrorist. The story is one that resembles many real world situations faced by the authorities in the War on Terrorism. The climactic scene was filmed in University Hall on the campus of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. Response On its original air date in the Tuesday 8:00 pm ET time slot, the series' second episode attracted 7.27 million viewers with 5.7% household rating and 9% household share, and 3.0% household rating and 8% household share among 18 to 49 years old viewers. In total viewers, there was a decrease of 33% from the first episode's 10.79 million. This was a considerable reduction in viewers compared to an average decrease of 10% to 15% for a new series in its second week.Berman, Marc, \\"Primetime Tuesday Ratings: NBC Wins; Strong Opening for NBC‚Äôs My Name is Earl; Solid NCIS on CBS \\", Mediaweek.com, September 21, 2005.

He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football for Missouri Southern State University. He was also a member of the Seattle Seahawks, Miami Dolphins, Philadelphia Eagles, and Denver Broncos. College career Barbre was a consensus All- American, All-MIAA and All-Region first-team selection in 2006. He helped lead an offensive line that saw quarterback Adam Hinspeter become just the second passer in school history to throw for 2,000 yards twice in a career. The offense amassed 3,461 yards for the season, including 2,527 passing. He finished with a career-high 94 knockdowns at left tackle and also excelled on the punt coverage unit, coming up with seven solo tackles. Barbre was Southern's first All-American since Josh Chapman in 2002, and was the first to be named First-Team since Richard Jordan in 1996. He was the fifth offensive lineman at Southern to be named First-Team All-American joining the likes of Terron Jackson (1972), Willie Williams (1976), Joel Tupper (1982) and Yancy McNight (1995). He was the ninth Lion overall to be named First-Team All- American. For his career, Barbre started 33 of 37 contests. All but one of those starting assignments came at the demanding left tackle position. He was credited with 254 knockdown blocks and registered ten tackles (9 solos) on special teams. He was the first player from Southern to be invited to the NFL Combine. Professional career Barbre was the highest-ever drafted player to come out of Missouri Southern until Brandon Williams. He joined Richard Jordan (1997) and Jim Hoots (1971) both of whom went in the seventh round, as the only players to be drafted from the school. Barbre joined current NFL and Southern alums Rod Smith (Denver Broncos) and James Thrash (Washington Redskins) as one of three former Lions in the NFL. Green Bay Packers In three seasons with the Packers, Barbre struggled to find a role on the team. Originally tried at left guard for two seasons, Barbre failed to earn a starting spot and was tried at right tackle for the 2009 season. Barbre began the season as the starter, but was ineffective and soon removed from the starting line-up. Philadelphia Eagles Barbre with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2013. Barbre signed with the Eagles in 2013. He played left tackle against the Packers in week 10 when starter Jason Peters was injured.

A number were sold to the Chinese Kwangsi Air Force. Development The A.W.16 was developed by Armstrong Whitworth to meet the requirements of Specification F9/26. With the first prototype flying in 1930, it was too late for consideration against this specification, and was submitted against specification Specification N21/26 for a naval fighter for the Fleet Air Arm. It was a single bay biplane with wings of unequal span braced with N-type interwing struts, and bore a close family resemblance to the A.W.XIV Starling Mk I, though with a less Siskin-like, humped fuselage. The undercarriage was fixed, undivided and spatted. The Armstrong Siddeley Panther radial engine, earlier known as the Jaguar Major was enclosed by a Townend ring. Problems with the Panther engine delayed the aircraft, and the competing Hawker Nimrod was purchased before the AW.16 could be delivered for evaluation. When it was evaluated, it showed inferior performance to the Nimrod, and had poor handling on an exposed carrier deck. Armstrong Whitworth continued to try to sell the aircraft, and produced a second prototype (G-ACCD) fitted with a more reliable Panther IIA engine for submission against Specification F7/30 for an order from the Royal Air Force. However, by this time the A.W.16 was out of date, and was quickly discarded from consideration, which was eventually won by the Gloster Gladiator. A number of production aircraft were made, however, with 17 ordered by the Kwangsi Air Force in China The first prototype A.W.16 was in 1933 experimentally fitted with the 15-cylinder 3-row radial Armstrong Siddeley Hyena, but this engine suffered from cooling problems and was abandoned. The second prototype was rebuilt into the Armstrong Whitworth Scimitar fighter. First prototype with double Townsend ring Operational history The 16 A.W.16 fighters for the Kwangsi air force were produced late in 1931, and were delivered via Hong Kong. While initially serving in the air force of the local Warlords, the A.W.16s were (along with the rest of the Kwangsi Air Force) incorporated in the main Chinese Nationalist Air Force in 1937.

Dickinson has refereed in many rugby competitions, including the Rugby World Cup, Tri Nations, Six Nations, international friendlies, Super 12/14/15, and Shute Shield. He was a referee at the 1999 Rugby World Cup, the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He is Australia's most- capped referee, and the only Australian referee to appear at three Rugby World Cups. Referee career Dickinson commenced refereeing at the age of 12 while also playing fly-half and fullback for Epping Boys' High School. He was employed full-time with the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) from 1996 to 2011. Prior to 1996, he worked as a site manager for Linfox, a transport company as well as with the New South Wales Police Force. He made his international refereeing debut in 1997 in a Rugby World Cup qualifier between Tahiti and Papua New Guinea. He refereed his first international match between two Tier 1 nations a year later for the 1998 international between Wales and South Africa at Wembley. Dickinson refereed several pool games in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, including Fiji's upset of Wales. Shortly after the 2007 World Cup, Dickinson authored a book entitled \\"The Rugby World Cup Diaries ‚Äì A referee's inside view.\\" Dickinson was publicly criticised by IRB referees manager Paddy O'Brien for his refereeing of the scrums in the Italy v New Zealand Test Match at the San Siro Stadium in Milan on 14 November 2009. O'Brien stated that Dickinson had got it \\"completely wrong\\", believing the Italian tight-head prop, Martin Castrogiovanni was boring in on his opposite. This led to outrage by the Australian Rugby Union, who issued a formal complaint to the IRB against Paddy O'Brien. O'Brien ended up apologising to Stuart Dickinson and the Australian Rugby Union: \\"I have unreservedly apologised to Stuart Dickinson for the action of publicly discussing elements of his performance review and would like to extend that apology to the Australian Rugby Union,\\" said O'Brien. Retirement In 2010 despite being rated in the Top 3 SANZAR Referees (after being appointed to the Super Rugby semi-final in Soweto) he was overlooked for the 6 Nations tournament for the first time since 2000. Then in 2011 Dickinson was overlooked for the Rugby World Cup. O'Brien denied there was any vendetta against Dickinson. Dickinson subsequently announced his retirement from refereeing on 27 September 2011.

Its Belgian subsidiary is Uitgeverij Lannoo. Its Dutch subsidiary is LannooMeulenhoff. Over the years Lannoo evolved from Catholic and Flemish to an open, commercial publishing house.  Uitgeverij Lannoo  The publishing and printing company Lannoo was founded in 1909 by Joris Lannoo (1891‚Äì1971). Joris Lannoo was a member of the Flemish Movement. The original company logo, featuring a sailing Viking neck, was designed by Joe English and modernized over the years. After Joris Lannoo, Jan and Godfried Lannoo took over the management of the company. In 1991 the publisher company spun off Lannoo Printers (the printing company went bankrupt in 2018). The French-language Editions Racine was founded in 1993. In 1994 Godfried Lannoo resigned as general manager to be replaced by his son Matthias Lannoo. In 1999 Lannoo acquired the Dutch publishing house Terra Zutphen and reorganized it into TerraLannoo. In 2003 the company set up its own scientific publishing house in Leuven, LannooCampus. In 2010, the company acquired the Dutch publishers Meulenhoff Boekerij and Unieboek Het Spectrum. Since then, Lannoo publishes literature again, an activity that had almost fallen silent in the second half of the 20th century. In 2015, the publishing group acquired the Belgian publisher Academia Press.

Meulenhoff Boekerij  Meulenhoff was founded in 1895 by Johannes Marius Meulenhoff. Over the years, it built a reputation publishing literary works in original Dutch and in translation. For many decades, the company was led by Laurens van Krevelen, who received the Jan Hein Donner Award (a prestigious Dutch prize, awarded once every five years to notable persons in the publishing industry) in 2007. Meulenhoff was acquired by the books division of PCM Uitgevers, then by Lannoo. In 2001, Meulenhoff was rocked by the departure of long-time editor Tilly Hermans, for which the Dutch and other media blamed the corporate culture of then owner PCM Uitgevers. PCM, it was said, cared more for the bottom line than for the company's authors and editors, and was blamed for a \\"purge\\" that also led to the early retirement of van Krevelen. After more than thirty years with Meulenhoff Hermans founded Augustus, a smaller publishing house. Thirty of authors followed her to the new publishing house, including Rudy Kousbroek and Adriaan van Dis). Others who left were Maarten Biesheuvel and Stefan Hertmans. Authors published by Meulenhoff include: Alicia Austin, Maarten Biesheuvel. Roberto Bola√±o, Stefan Hertmans, Annemarie Kindt, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carl Lundgren, E.

Bogaard and A.H. Bloemsma. Its first location was a room above a bakery in de Biltstraat in Utrecht. Het Spectrum started as a progressive-Catholic publisher that aspired to supply good reading materials to the masses. Hence it published many pocket books. After World War II, this formula continued as Prisma Pockets. Among the pocket books were translated classics for the modest price of 1,25 guilder. The Prisma dictionaries were also part of this line. Gradually the publishing company became one of the largest in the Netherlands. Dutch authors that have been published through the Het Spectrum imprints include Godfried Bomans, Han van Bree, Hubrecht Duijker, L. T. F. Gamut, Ben Tiggelaar, and Janwillem van de Wetering.

Life and career Hathaway was born in 1872 (although some resources say 1874), in Lexington, Kentucky. He was born to the Reverend Robert Elijah Hathaway and his wife Rachel (n√©e Scott), and was the youngest of their children; he was raised by his father after the death of his mother. Hathaway‚Äôs desire to become an artist was a result of a visit to a museum. At the museum, Hathaway noticed there were no pieces made by or depicting African Americans. At that point, in an early stage in his life, he vowed to represent his people. He began formal academic studies at Chandler Junior College in Lexington in 1890, followed by classes in art and dramatics at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. While in Boston he sculpted his first bust, and his subject was Bishop Richard Allen, the first bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). Hathaway attended many colleges, including: Chandler College in Lexington; Pittsburg Auxiliary Normal College (now Pittsburg State University) in Pittsburg, Kansas; New York State College of Ceramics; the Ceramic College at the State University of Kansas. At these colleges, Hathaway studied art history and ceramics, but he also developed an interest in sculpture. The Cincinnati Art Academy was where Hathaway had his first formal training in ceramics. Upon finishing his schooling, Hathaway returned to Kentucky. In Kentucky, Hathaway worked as teacher in an elementary school. Hathaway began to make his own pieces in his spare time. Most of Hathaway‚Äôs pieces were sculptures. He is most noted for his busts of famous African Americans, including his personal hero, Frederick Douglass. The medium of most of his pieces was plaster, but he also made some of bronze. Hathaway‚Äôs success had lasting effects. He taught at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff before moving to Tuskegee Institute, where he became a founding member of the Department of Ceramics. He was also the first African American to design a U.S. coin. During his life, Hathaway designed two U.S. coins. His first was the Booker T. Washington Memorial half dollar bearing the face of Booker T. Washington in 1946. His second was the George Washington Carver/Booker T. Washington commemorative half dollar in 1951, which featured George Washington Carver. Death and legacy Hathaway‚Äôs works are displayed in a museum bearing his name in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Hathaway died on March 12, 1967 in Montgomery, Alabama.

He played college football for Brown University, and was drafted by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection as a long snapper. DeOssie has earned two Super Bowl rings with the Giants in Super Bowl XLII and Super Bowl XLVI, both over his hometown New England Patriots. He is the son of former NFL linebacker Steve DeOssie; the two hold the distinction of being the only father-son duo to win Super Bowls with the same franchise. Early years DeOssie attended Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts where he was named to the All-New England Prep Team. He also lettered in basketball and captained both the varsity basketball and football teams during his senior year. College career DeOssie played in 36 games with 29 starts at Brown and recorded 315 tackles (187 solos) with 10.5 sacks, 36.5 stops for losses, 5 quarterback pressures, 5 forced fumbles, 11 deflected passes and 1 blocked kick and 4 interceptions for 60 yards in returns. He was a two-time I-AA All- American at Brown and was twice among the finalists for the Buck Buchanan Award, which goes to the nation's top FCS defensive player. As a senior in 2006, was a First-team All-America by The NFL Draft Report, earning 3rd-team honors from the Associated Press. As a senior, he was a First-team All-Ivy League for the third consecutive season, he started all 10 games at strongside inside linebacker and he led the Bears with a career-high 110 tackles including 68 solo stops. As a junior, he led Brown with 80 tackles, 12 tackles for a loss, 5 quarterback sacks, one interception, one blocked kick and three forced fumbles despite missing three games and was a First-team All-Ivy League selection. The prior year, as a sophomore, he was a First-Team All-Ivy selection. He made 98 tackles and intercepted a pass. Professional career DeOssie at Super Bowl XLII victory parade Pre-draft DeOssie became the first player in Brown's history to be invited to NFL Combine in 2007 and was the only Ivy league player invited that season. His 4.58-second 40-yard dash was eighth-fastest among all linebackers - a factor that significantly boosted his draft stock. His 26 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press was the fifth-best for a linebacker. He had a 34¬Ω\\" vertical leap, a 10'2\\" broad jump, a 4.00 in the short shuttle, and a 6.89 in the three-cone drill and scored a 24 on the Wonderlic. New York Giants Washington Redskins DeOssie was selected in the fourth round (116th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. He mostly played on special teams during his rookie season, taking over as the long snapper when starter Ryan Kuehl was placed on injured reserve midway through the year. He finished with six tackles for the season as the Giants won Super Bowl XLII. DeOssie played an extended role on defense in 2008 after Mathias Kiwanuka moved from outside linebacker to defensive end. He continued to share the long snapping duties with Jay Alford and was chosen by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid as a need player in the 2009 Pro Bowl. In 2008, DeOssie played in all 16 games and the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against Philadelphia. He served as the long snapper and finished 3rd on the team in special team tackles with 13.

They defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI in Indianapolis. On September 2, 2012, he was chosen as one of the three captains for the Giants. On December 8, 2015, DeOssie was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to a wrist injury. Prior to being placed on injured reserve, he had played in 140 consecutive games for the Giants, having not missed a single game since being drafted in 2007. On February 24, 2017, DeOssie signed a two-year contract extension with the Giants. On March 12, 2019, DeOssie re-signed with the Giants. He was placed on injured reserve on November 30, 2019. On August 7, 2020, DeOssie announced his retirement from the NFL after 13 seasons. Personal life DeOssie is the son of Dianna and Steve DeOssie. His father is a former NFL player who was a member of the Giants' Super Bowl XXV-winning team. As a result of the Giants' win in Super Bowl XLII, the DeOssies became the first father-son duo to win a Super Bowl as members of the same franchise. Growing up in North Andover, Massachusetts, DeOssie was a New England Patriots fan and served as a ball boy. He would later be on the Giants team that ended New England's undefeated run in Super Bowl XLII and afterwards on Super Bowl XLVI.

In 2017, approximately 20 Chinese companies using VIE structures conducted or filed for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the U.S. VIEs are also closely related to the concept of a special purpose entity. Similarly, VIEs \\"are often established as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to passively hold financial assets, or to actively conduct research and development. For example, a company may establish a VIE to finance a project without putting the whole enterprise at risk. However, just as other SPVs have been misused in the past, these structures are frequently used to keep securitized assets off corporate balance sheets.\\" One importance of identifying a VIE is that a company needs to consolidate such entities if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Note: The guidance in FIN 46 and FIN 46R was subsequently revised when FASB issued Statement 167. Criteria A VIE is an entity meeting one of the following three criteria as elaborated in FASB ASC 810-10 [formerly FIN 46 (Revised)]: * The equity-at-risk is not sufficient to support the entity's activities (e.g.: the entity is thinly capitalized, the group of equity holders possess no substantive voting rights, etc.) * As a group, the equity- at-risk holders cannot control the entity * The economics do not coincide with the voting interests (commonly known as the \\"anti-abuse rule\\")  Difference between a VIE share and a traditional stock certificate  A share of stock, or a stock certificate, certifies ownership of a portion of a company. In other words, it provides proof of a legal proprietary interest in company assets. In contrast, a VIE Share (often mistakenly referred to as a share of stock) certifies ownership of a contractual right to a percentage of a company‚Äôs profits. Unlike a traditional stock certificate, the VIE share provides a legal proprietary interest in a completely separate company's assets (sometimes referred to as a shell company). The contractual right certified by the VIE share is derived from a contract between (1) the company named on the VIE share and (2) the shell company. In other words, VIE shareholders only have a traditional stock certificate in the completely separate company, which is entitled to a percentage of the named company's profits.  Alibaba as an example  For example, Alibaba, the world's largest retailer and e-commerce company, uses a VIE structure allowing U.S. citizens to purchase VIE shares in Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In September 2014, under the ticker symbol BABA, Alibaba went public on the NYSE at a VIE share price of around $68. It began trading with a bang, soaring 38 percent to close at $93.89 per share. As of September 13, 2019, the share price was around $179 at the closing bell. This represents an increase of around 163%, or 21.36% 5-year compound annual growth rate. BABA shareholders own a stake, through American Depositary Shares, in Alibaba Group Holding Limited, a Cayman Islands-registered entity, which is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba's lucrative Chinese assets. BABA shareholders do not have a proprietary interest in the chinese-registered Alibaba company's assets, only its profits. The following is an excerpt from Alibaba's Form F-1 [a public document as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]: > \\"Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among > other areas, value-added telecommunications services, which include Internet > content providers, or ICPs, we, similar to all other entities with foreign- > incorporated holding company structures operating in our industry in China, > operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign > investment is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through wholly-foreign > owned enterprises, majority-owned entities and variable interest entities. > The relevant variable interest entities, which are 100% owned by PRC > citizens or by PRC entities owned by PRC citizens, hold the ICP licenses and > operate the various websites for our Internet businesses.

He scored another four goals in the second game of the 1908 Olympics, a 17-1 defeat of the France A team, the biggest ever win of the Denmark national team. In the final game of the tournament, Denmark lost 2-0 to Great Britain, thus winning silver medals. Four years later, Wolfhagen scored one goal in Denmark's three games at the 1912 Olympics, before they were once again defeated by Great Britain in the final. He ended his national team career in October 1917, having scored 14 goals in 18 national team games. Wolfhagen was also a good bandy player. He played bandy for Fredriksberg Sk√∏jtel√∏berforening 1902-1922 and took part as a bandy player at the Nordic Games in 1909 and 1917. Wolfhagen's profession was in the military.

Elements of the show resemble Tarrant's future hit Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, particularly its \\"Fastest Finger First\\" game.

This continued until less than ten players survived, at which point they face four questions which are worth ¬£50 each. If more than ten players remained after the sixth question, the ten fastest players went through. The player who correctly answers the final question the fastest goes on to play the final round.

He was drafted by the Cowboys in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football at Northern Illinois University. Early years Free attended Lincoln High School in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. As a junior, he received All-Fox Valley Conference honors. As a senior, he was named Defensive Lineman of the Year, All-state, and All-Fox Valley Conference on both offense (tight end) and defense (defensive tackle). He tallied 64 tackles, 8 sacks, 6 fumble-cause hits, 5 passes defensed, 2 fumble recoveries, 7 blocked kicks, 6 receptions for 141 yards, one touchdown. College career Free accepted a football scholarship from Northern Illinois University, with the plan of being converted into an offensive tackle. As a redshirt freshman, he was forced to start at left tackle, when sophomore tackle Shea Fitzgerald was killed along with 12 others, in a back porch collapse during a party in Lincoln Park, in Chicago, Illinois. He had 10 starts at left tackle and 2 at tight end. As a sophomore, he developed into an athletic player that earned him the nickname \\"Doug Freak\\" among his teammates. He settled at left tackle with 12 starts and was named second-team All-MAC. As a junior, he started 12 games at left tackle, receiving first-team All-MAC and honorable mention All-American honors. Professional career Free was selected in the fourth round (122nd overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. As a rookie, he was named a starter in his first preseason game, but suffered a knee sprain that would delayed his development and contributed to him being inactive for the first 15 games of the season, until playing at right tackle during the fourth quarter of the last game. He was declared inactive during the first 13 weeks of the 2008 season. The next year, a season-ending injury to Marc Colombo pushed him into starting seven games at right tackle, performing at a high level while allowing only one sack. After the April 1, 2010 release of Flozell Adams, Free became the starting left tackle. On July 26, 2011, the Cowboys avoided him testing the free agent market and rewarded him with a four-year, $32 million contract, with $17 million guaranteed. In 2012, the team decided to move him back to right tackle after his play regressed; exchanging positions with Tyron Smith. He was still seen as a liability even with the change, so the team gave more playing time to Jermey Parnell in the final four games of the season. After having to share his playing time and giving up seven sacks, five holding penalties and seven false starts, he accepted a reduced salary in order to avoid being waived before the start of the 2013 season. In 2014, he was a starter in what was arguably considered the best offensive line in the league and also emerged as the unit's leader. In October, he suffered a sprained right foot in the last minutes of the Week 6 win against the Seattle Seahawks, causing him to miss three games. He also missed the team's last four games (including two in the playoffs) with a left ankle stress fracture, which led him to have off season surgery. On March 7, 2015, Free re-signed with the Cowboys on a three-year, $15 million contract. He started all 16 games and although he was a solid contributor at right tackle, he led the team in penalties (nine). In 2016, he was a part of what was considered the best offensive line in the NFL. He started all 16 games, even though he was limited with foot and ankle injuries. On March 11, 2017, Free announced his retirement from the NFL after 10 seasons.

The species is endemic to North America.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. (hardcover), (paperback). (Thamnophis butleri, pp. 146-147). Etymology The specific name butleri is in honor of the ornithologist Amos Butler (1860-1937) of Brookville, Indiana.Cope 1889.Beolens, Bo, Michael Watkins, and Michael Grayson (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Thamnophis butleri, p. 44). Geographic range T. butleri is found in northwestern Ohio, northeastern Indiana, the eastern portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, and the adjacent extreme southern tip of Ontario, Canada. Also, a disjunct population is found in southeastern Wisconsin.Conant, Roger. (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (hardcover), (paperback). (Thamnophis butleri, p. 161 + Plate 23 + Map 113). Description and identification The butlers garter snake is a small, slender snake, averaging in total length (including tail), with three yellow to orange stripes along the length of its body. The background color can range from olive-brown to black, and it may also be possible to discern two rows of dark spots between the side and back stripes. These features do little to distinguish them from most other garter snakes species, but the placement of the lateral, or side, stripes is unique to this species. In Butler's garter snakes, the lateral stripes are centered on the third scale row up from the ventral scales, and they also overlap the adjacent second and fourth scale rows. This contrasts with the lateral stripe placement of other garter snake species. For those hoping to avoid getting close enough to inspect the position of the lateral stripe, other features may help in their identification. The head is unusually small for a garter snake, and, when excited, the effort this snake expends to escape seems to go more towards thrashing in place than to getting away. Ecology Butler's garter snakes inhabit moist, grassy, open canopy areas, such as meadows, wet prairies, marshes, savannas and grasslands. Like Kirtland's snake, they may also be found in grassy vacant lots in suburban and residential areas. The species can often be found under rocks, logs, trash, and boards. They subsist on a diet of mainly earthworms, but they may also eat leeches, salamanders, and frogs. The species hibernates communally, often with other garter snake species. Butler's garter snakes are a relatively short-lived species, and they reach sexual maturity in their second spring. Reproduction T. butleri is ovoviviparous. Mating takes place in late March and early April. The young are born in June or July, in broods of four to 14.Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis. (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Thamnophis butleri, pp. 251-252). The newborns are long. Conservation status In Indiana, Butler's garter snake is listed as an endangered species. In Ontario, the species is also listed as endangered. References Further reading *Behler, J.L., and F.W.

She was a cousin of Sir Winston Churchill, with whom she had enjoyed an amicable relationship, though her support for the October Revolution in 1917 caused them to break ranks politically. She enjoyed travelling around the world; and among her circle of friends were Princess Margaret of Sweden, Lord and Lady Mountbatten, Lady Diana Cooper, Vita Sackville-West and Vivien Leigh. Early life Clare Consuelo Frewen was born in London, the daughter of Moreton Frewen, the Anglo-Irish owner of Brede Place in East Sussex, and his American wife, the former Clarita \\"Clara\\" Jerome. Jerome's mother was the elder sister of Lady Randolph Churchill, which made Clare Sheridan a cousin to Winston Churchill. Her godmother and namesake was Consuelo Vanderbilt, Duchess of Marlborough. Sheridan was educated by governesses at home in Sussex and at a family property in Inishannon, County Cork, before briefly attending a Paris convent school and a German finishing school. She was a debutante at the age of seventeen but turned away from that social scene to attempt to write novels. She was encouraged in this by family friends who included both Henry James and Rudyard Kipling. She married Wilfred, known as William, Frederick Sheridan in 1910 at St. Margaret's, Westminster. They had two daughters; and, when one of them, Elizabeth, died in February 1914, Clare Sheridan made a sculpture of a small weeping angel for the child's grave. It was from this piece of art that she discovered an ability for sculpting. Wilfred Sheridan was a Lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade, and he was killed while leading his men at the Battle of Loos in 1915, a few days after the birth of the couple's third child, their son Richard. Sheridan moved from France to London to study under John Tweed and Professor √âdouard Lant√©ri. An exhibition of her work was a success and led to a number of commissions including a bust portrait of H. H. Asquith for the Oxford Union. Soviet Russia Bust of Lev Kamenev by Sheridan In the summer of 1920, the first Soviet Russian trade delegation to visit London invited Sheridan to travel to Russia to make busts of notable revolutionaries. The British authorities refused to issue her visa but she sailed with the delegation to Stockholm where Lev Kamenev obtained an Estonian visa for her. She stayed in the Kremlin for two months, where her sculpting subjects included Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Felix Dzerzhinsky and Kamenev. While in Russia, Sheridan is reputed to have had affairs with more than one of her sitters. Her reputed relationship with Kamenev is thought to have started the problems in his marriage to his first wife, Olga Kameneva.Kehoe, Elisabeth; The Titled Americans: Three American Sisters and the English Aristocratic World Into Which They Married, Atlantic Monthly Press, (2004) pg.325. The author Robert Service claimed, in 2009, that there was an affair between Sheridan and Trotsky. Trotsky signed and dedicated a painting of himself to Sheridan and invited her to stay in Russia and set up a studio. During her stay, the Russian Civil War was being fought. Winston Churchill, as Secretary of State for War, was pressing for British and allied intervention and was furious to learn of Sheridan's activities. When she returned to London, Churchill refused to see her, and after finding herself widely shunned in polite society due to her support of Bolshevism, she moved to America. In January 1921, Sheridan and her son, Richard sailed aboard the , from Southampton to New York where they arrived on 30 January 1921. Also making the crossing was Commander Hugo W. Koehler, USN, the American naval spy who was returning to America from ten months spent with the White army in the Crimea.The New York Tribune. January 31, 1921.Our Man in the Crimea: Commander Hugo Koehler and the Russian Civil War. P.J. Capelotti. University of South Carolina Press. (1991) pg. 173-174. Sheridan met Koehler on the ship, and despite her Bolshevist sympathies and his allegiance to the White Movement, they became friends. Sheridan described Koehler as \\"heaven sent\\", writing that \\"Koehler promised to be at my side in case of need. He was amazingly kind and put up with infinite boredom and waiting on our account.\\" Mayfair to Moscow: Clare Sheridan's Diary (1921 Bonie & Liverite). Sheridan, Clare. p. 229-235 In a letter Koehler wrote in 1922, he mentioned the \\"famous Mrs. Sheridan at whom the Foreign Office thundered so loudly... and yet be it known (although this, of course, is closely guarded) that she was an agent for the British Intelligence Service.\\" Journalism Sheridan, Hugo Koehler (holding her son, Richard) and others, aboard RMS Aquitania, January 1921 While visiting America, Sheridan had a love affair with Charlie Chaplin. She was also introduced to Herbert Swope, the editor of the New York World who, impressed by her account of her time in Russia which had been published as Russian Portraits, offered her a job as the papers' roving European correspondent. In this role she obtained a number of notable scoops for the paper. During the Irish Civil War she managed to interview both Michael Collins and Rory O'Connor. She filed vivid accounts from the occupied city of Smyrna during the Greco-Turkish War. Sheridan interviewed Aleksandar Stamboliyski in Bulgaria, Benito Mussolini in Rome and Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. A second trip to Russia in 1923 ended in her becoming disillusioned with the course of the Revolution and she was declared 'persona non grata' in the country. Despite this, Sheridan persuaded the Soviet representative to London to issue an entry visa for her and her brother to tour the south of the country. In 1924, Sheridan and her brother, Royal Navy officer Oswald Frewen, made a then-daring long-distance motorcycle riding journey from Sussex through Europe to the USSR, ending in Odessa. The ride occurred between July and September 1924 with Frewen at the controls of a 799 cc, 7 hp AJS motorcycle and Sheridan in the sidecar. The AJS, nicknamed Satanella, is said to have been the first British motorcycle in the Soviet Union. Sheridan published a memoir of the journey, Across Europe with Satanella in 1925. She moved to Constantinople with her two children and gave up journalism to focus on sculpture. Sheridan's dalliance with known Soviet agents earned her the suspicions of the Security Service. She earned an MI5 file that noted: \\"She has conducted herself in a disloyal manner in various foreign countries, adopting a consistently anti-British attitude.\\" Later, in 1925, Sheridan moved to Algeria, where it was noted by MI5 that \\"she appeared to be comfortably off and debt-free for the first time in 10 years\\". She built a house on the edge of the Sahara at Biskra. Later life In 1937, Sheridan's son, Richard, died of appendicitis at Constantine in Algeria. Sheridan took a large oak tree from the family home, Brede Place, in Sussex and carved it into his memorial. Carving in wood seems to have given her a fresh artistic direction. After spending a summer in an art colony on a Native American reservation in the Rocky Mountains, Sheridan had a well-received exhibition in London of the carvings she made there from tree trunks. During World War Two she and Winston Churchill put aside their political differences and she made a bust portrait of him whilst he painted her portrait. After the war she converted to Roman Catholicism, travelling to Assisi for that purpose before moving to live in a guest house run by the Franciscan convent at Hope Castle at Castleblayney in Ireland. From there, she continued to sculpt, albeit subjects and icons of religious importance before returning to live in Belmont House in Hastings, Sussex in 1956. In 1958 she sculpted a life-size figure head of a helmsman for the Hastings Fishermen's Museum. She died in 1970 at the age of 84, having outlived two of her three children. She is buried in the churchyard of St George's, Brede, Sussex beside her nephew Roger Frewen [d 1972] and her great-niece Selina Frewen [d 1972] and near the memorial she had carved to her son. When she died in 1970, Margaret Sheridan, her only daughter, inherited her copyrights. When Margaret Sheridan died in 1976, it is believed that her mother's and her own copyrights had no heir.Contact for Clare Sheridan 1885‚Äì1970, UTexas. Retrieved 3 October 2016 Sheridan's famous busts of her first cousin Churchill can be found at Blenheim Palace, Chartwell, Harrow School and Hastings Town Hall; the original plaster is in the possession of her great-nephew Jonathan Frewen. Some items from her large collection of Native American artefacts are on display at Hastings Museum and in the Frewen family's ancestral village of Brede in Sussex.

As the Unicode Glossary says: > A character that would not have been encoded except for compatibility and > round-trip convertibility with other standardsUnicode consortium Unicode > Glossary Although compatibility is used in names, it is not marked as a property. However, the definition is more complicated than the glossary reveals. One of the properties given to characters by the Unicode consortium is the characters' decomposition or compatibility decomposition. Over five thousand characters do have a compatibility decomposition mapping that compatibility character to one or more other UCS characters. By setting a character's decomposition property, Unicode establishes that character as a compatibility character. The reasons for these compatibility designations are varied and are discussed in further detail below. The term decomposition sometimes confuses because a character's decomposition can, in some cases, be a singleton. In these cases the decomposition of one character is simply another approximately (but not canonically) equivalent character.  Compatibility character types and keywords  The compatibility decomposition property for the 5,402 Unicode compatibility characters includes a keyword that divides the compatibility characters into 17 logical groups. Those characters with a compatibility decomposition but without a keyword are termed canonical decomposable characters and those characters are not compatibility characters. Keywords for compatibility decomposable characters include: <initial>, <medial>, <final>, <isolated>, <wide>, <narrow>, <small>, <square>, <vertical>, <circle>, <noBreak>, <fraction>, <sub>, <super>, and <compat>. These keywords provide some indication of the relation between the compatibility character and its compatibility decomposition character sequence. Compatibility characters fall in three basic categories: # Characters corresponding to multiple alternate glyph forms and precomposed diacritics to support software and font implementations that do not include complete Unicode text layout capabilities. # Characters included from other character sets or otherwise added to the UCS that constitute rich text rather than the plain text goals of Unicode. # Some other characters that are semantically distinct, but visually similar. Because these semantically distinct characters may be displayed with glyphs similar to the glyphs of other characters, text processing software should try to address possible confusion for the sake of end users. When comparing and collating (sorting) text strings, different forms and rich text variants of characters should not alter the text processing results. For example, software users may be confused when performing a find on a page for a capital Latin letter 'I' and their software application fails to find the visually similar Roman numeral '‚Ö†'.  Compatibility mappings types   Glyph substitution and composition  Some compatibility characters are completely dispensable for text processing and display software that conforms to the Unicode standard. These include: ;Ligatures: Ligatures such as 'ffi' in the Latin script were often encoded as a separate character in legacy character sets. Unicode's approach to ligatures is to treat them as rich text and, if turned on, handle them through glyph substitution. ;Precomposed Roman numerals: For example, Roman numeral twelve ('‚Ö´': U+216B) can be decomposed into a Roman numeral ten ('‚Ö©': U+2169) and two Roman numeral ones ('‚Ö†': U+2160). ;Precomposed fractions: These decomposition have the keyword <fraction>. A fully conforming text handler should display the vulgar fraction ¬º (U+00BC) identically to the composed fraction 1‚ÅÑ4 (numeral 1 with fraction slash U+2044 and numeral 4). ;Contextual glyphs or forms: These arise primarily in the Arabic script. Using fonts with glyph substitution capabilities such as OpenType and TrueTypeGX, Unicode conforming software can substitute the proper glyphs for the same character depending on whether that character appears at the beginning, end, middle of a word or in isolation. Such glyph substitution is also necessary for vertical (top to bottom) text layout for some East Asian languages. In this case glyphs must be substituted or synthesized for wide, narrow, small and square glyph forms. Non-conforming software or software using other character sets instead use multiple separate character for the same letter depending on its position: further complicating text processing. The UCS, Unicode character properties and the Unicode algorithms provide software implementations with everything needed to properly display these characters from their decomposition equivalents. Therefore, these decomposable compatibility characters become redundant and unnecessary. Their existence in the character set requires extra text processing to ensure text is properly compared and collated (see Unicode normalization). Moreover, these compatibility characters provide no additional or distinct semantics. Nor do these characters provide any visually distinct rendering provided the text layout and fonts are Unicode conforming. Also, none of these characters are required for round-trip convertibility to other character sets, since the transliteration can easily map decomposed characters to precomposed counterparts in another character set. Similarly, contextual forms, such as a final Arabic letter can be mapped based on its position within a word to the appropriate legacy character set form character. In order to dispense with these compatibility characters, text software must conform to several Unicode protocols. The software must be able to: #Compose diacritic marked graphemes from letter characters and one or more separate combining diacritic marks. #Substitute (at the author or reader's discretion) ligatures and contextual glyph variants. #Layout CJKV text vertically (at the author's or reader's discretion), substituting glyphs for small, vertical, narrow, wide square forms, either from font data or synthesized as needed. #Combine fractions using the 'Fraction Slash' character (‚ÅÑ U+2044) and any other arbitrary characters. #Combine a 'Combining Long Solidus Overlay' ( Ã∏ U+0338) with other symbols: for example ‚àÑ or ‚àÑ for ‚àÑ (U+2203). All together these compatibility characters included for incomplete Unicode implementations total 3,779 of the 5,402 designated compatibility characters. These include all of the compatibility characters marked with the keywords <initial>, <medial>, <final>, <isolated>, <fraction>, <wide>, <narrow>, <small>, <vertical>, <square>. Also it includes nearly all of the canonical and most of the <compat> keyword compatibility characters (the exceptions include those <compat> keyword characters for enclosed alphanumerics, enclosed ideographs and those discussed in ¬ß Semantically distinct characters).  Rich text compatibility characters  Many other compatibility characters constitute what Unicode considers rich text and therefore outside the goals of Unicode and UCS. In some sense even compatibility characters discussed in the previous section‚Äîthose that aid legacy software in displaying ligatures and vertical text‚Äîconstitute a form of rich text, since the rich text protocols determine whether text is displayed in one way or another. However, the choice to display text with or without ligatures or vertically versus horizontally are both non-semantic rich text. They are simply style differences. This is in contrast to other rich text such as italics, superscripts and subscripts, or list markers where the styling of the rich text implies certain semantics along with it. For comparing, collating, handling and storing plain text, rich text variants are semantically redundant. For example, using a superscript character for the numeral 4 is likely indistinguishable from using the standard character for a numeral 4 and then using rich text protocols to make it superscript. Such alternate rich text characters therefore create ambiguity because they appear visually the same as their plain text counterpart characters with rich text formatting applied. These rich text compatibility characters include: ;Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols: These symbols are simply clones of the Latin and Greek alphabets and Indic-Arabic decimal digits repeated in 15 various typefaces. They are intended as an arbitrary palette for mathematical notation. However, they tend to undermine the distinction between encoding characters versus encoding visual glyphs as well as Unicode's goals of supporting only plain text characters. Such alternate styling for a mathematical symbol palette could be easily created through rich text protocols instead. ;Enclosed Alphanumerics and ideographs (markers): These are characters included primarily for list markers. They do not constitute plain text characters. Moreover, the use of other rich text protocols is more appropriate since, the set of enclosed alphanumerics or ideographs provisioned in the UCS is limited. ;Circled alphanumerics and ideographs: The circled forms are also likely for use as markers. Again, using characters along with rich text protocols to encircle characters strings is more flexible. ;Spaces and no-break spaces of varying widths: These characters are simply rich text variants of the core space (U+0020) and No-break Space (U+00A0). Other rich text protocols should be used instead such as tracking, kerning or word- spacing attributes. ;Some subscript and superscript form characters: Many of the subscript and superscript characters are actually semantically distinct characters from the International Phonetic Alphabet and other writing systems and do not really fall in the category of rich text. However, others simply constitute rich text presentation forms of other Greek, Latin and numeral characters. These rich text superscript and subscript characters therefore properly belong to this category of rich text compatibility characters. Most of these are in the \\"Superscripts and Subscripts\\" or the \\"Basic Latin\\" blocks. For all of these rich text compatibility characters the display of glyphs is typically distinct from their compatibility decomposition (related) characters. However, these are considered compatibility characters and discouraged for use by the Unicode consortium because they are not plain text characters, which is what Unicode seeks to support with its UCS and associated protocols. Rich text should be handled through non-Unicode protocols such as HTML, CSS, RTF and other such protocols. The rich text compatibility characters comprise 1,451 of the 5,402 compatibility characters. These include all of the compatibility characters marked with keywords <circle> and <font> (except three listed in the semantically distinct below); 11 spaces variants from the <compat> and canonical characters; and some of the keyword <superscript> and <subscript> from the \\"Superscripts and Subscripts\\" block.  Semantically distinct characters  Many compatibility characters are semantically distinct characters, though they may share representational glyphs with other characters. Some of these characters may have been included because most other characters sets that focused on one script or writing system. So for example, the ISO and other Latin character sets likely included a character for œÄ (pi) since, when focusing on primarily one writing system or script, those character sets would not have otherwise had characters for the common mathematical symbol œÄ;. However, with Unicode, mathematicians are free to use characters from any known script in the World to stand in for a mathematical set or mathematical constant. To date, Unicode has only added specific semantic support for a few such mathematical constants (for example the Planck constant, U+210E, and Euler constant, U+2107, both of which Unicode considers to be compatibility characters). Therefore, Unicode designates several mathematical symbols based on letters from Greek and Hebrew as compatibility characters. These include: * Hebrew letter based symbols (4): alef (‚Ñµ U+2135), bet (‚Ñ∂ U+2136), gimel (‚Ñ∑ U+2137) and dalet (‚Ñ∏ U+2138) * Greek letter based symbols (7): beta (œê U+03D0), theta (œë U+03D1), phi (œï U+03D5), pi (œñ U+03D6), kappa (œ∞ U+03F0), rho (œ± U+03F1), capital theta (œ¥ U+03F4) While these compatibility characters are distinguished from their compatibility decomposition characters only by adding the word \\"symbol\\" to their name, they do represent long-standing distinct meanings in written mathematics. However, for all practical purposes they share the same semantics as their compatibility equivalent Greek or Hebrew letter. These may be considered border-line semantically distinguishable characters so they are not included in the total. Though not the intention of Unicode to encode such measuring units the repertoire includes six (6) such symbols that should not be used by authors: the characters' decompositions should be used instead. * Unit symbols (6): Angstrom (√Ö U+212B: use U+00C5 instead), Ohm (Œ©, U+2126: use U+03A9 instead), Kelvin (K U+212A: use U+004B instead), Fahrenheit (‚Ñâ U+2109: use U+00B0 and U+0046 instead), Celsius (‚ÑÉ U+2103: use U+00B0 and U+0043 instead), Micro Sign (¬µ U+00B5: use U+03BC instead) Unicode also designates twenty-two (22) other letter-like symbols as compatibility characters. * Other Greek letter-based symbols (4): lunate epsilon (œµ U+03F5), lunate sigma (œ≤ U+03F2), capital lunate sigma (œπ U+03F9), upsilon with hook (œí U+03D2) * Mathematical constants (3): Euler constant (‚Ñá U+2107), Planck constant (‚Ñé U+210E), reduced Planck constant (‚Ñè U+210F), * Currency symbols (2): rupee sign (‚Ç® U+20A8), rial sign (Ô∑º U+FDFC) * Punctuation (4): one dot leader (U+2024), no-break space (U+00A0), non-breaking hyphen (U+2011), Tibetan mark delimiter tsheg bstar (U+0F0C) * Other letter-like symbols (10): information source (‚Ñπ U+2139), account of (‚ÑÄ U+2100), addressed to the subject (‚ÑÅ U+2101), care of (‚ÑÖ U+2105), cada una (‚ÑÜ U+2106), numero (‚Ññ U+2116), telephone sign (‚Ñ° U+2121), facsimile sign (‚Ñª U+213B), trademark (‚Ñ¢ U+2122), service mark (‚Ñ† U+2120) In addition, several scripts use glyph position such as superscripts and subscripts to differentiate semantics. In these cases subscripts and superscripts are not merely rich text, but constitute a distinct character ‚Äî similar to a hybrid between a diacritic and a letter ‚Äî in the writing system (130 total). * 112 characters representing abstract phonemes from phonetic alphabets such as the International Phonetic Alphabet use such positional glyphs to represent semantic differences (U+1D2C ‚Äì U+1D6A, U+1D78, U+1D9B ‚Äì U+1DBF, U+02B0 ‚Äì U+02B8, U+02E0 ‚Äì U+02E4 ) * 14 characters from the Kanbun block (U+3192 ‚Äì U+319F) * 1 character from the Tifinagh script: Tifinagh Modifier Letter Labialization Mark (‚µØ U+2D6F) * 1 character from the Georgian script: Modifier Letter Georgian Nar (·Éº U+10FC) * masculine (U+00BA) and feminine (U+00AA) ordinal indicators included in the Latin-1 supplement block Finally, Unicode designates Roman numerals as compatibility equivalence to the Latin letters that share the same glyphs. * Capital Roman Numerals (7): One (‚Ö† U+2160), Five (‚Ö§ U+2164), Ten (‚Ö© U+2169), Fifty (‚Ö¨ U+216C), One Hundred (‚Ö≠ U+216D), Five Hundred (‚ÖÆ U+216E), One Thousand (‚ÖØ U+216F) * and lower case variants (7): One (‚Ö∞ U+2170), Five (‚Ö¥ U+2174), Ten (‚Öπ U+2179), Fifty (‚Öº U+217C), One Hundred (‚ÖΩ U+217D), Five Hundred (‚Öæ U+217E) and One Thousand (‚Öø U+217F) * 18 precomposed Roman numerals in uppercase and lowercase variants (2‚Äì4, 6‚Äì9 and 11‚Äì12) Roman numeral One Thousand actually has a third character representing a third form or glyph for the same semantic unit: One Thousand C D (‚ÜÄ U+2180). From this glyph, one can see where the practice of using a Latin M may have arisen. Strangely, though Unicode unifies the sign-value Roman numerals with the very different (though visually similar) Latin letters, the Indic Arabic place-value (positional) decimal digit numerals are repeated 24 times (a total of 240 code points for 10 numerals) throughout the UCS without any relational or decomposition mapping between them. The presence of these 167 semantically distinct though visually similar characters (plus the borderline 11 Hebrew and Greek letter based symbols and the 6 measurement unit symbols) among the decomposable characters complicates the topic of compatibility characters. The Unicode standard discourages the use of compatibility characters by content authors. However, in certain specialized areas, these characters are important and quite similar to other characters that have not been included among the compatibility characters. For example, in certain academic circles the use of Roman numerals as distinct from Latin letters that share the same glyphs would be no different from the use of Cuneiform numerals or ancient Greek numerals. Collapsing the Roman numeral characters to Latin letter characters eliminates a semantic distinction. A similar situation exists for phonetic alphabet characters that use subscript or superscript positioned glyphs. In the specialized circles that use phonetic alphabets, authors should be able to do so without resorting to rich text protocols. As another example the keyword 'circle' compatibility characters are often used for describing the game Go. However, these uses of the compatibility characters constitute exceptions where the author has a special reason to use the otherwise discouraged characters.  Compatibility blocks  Several blocks of Unicode characters include either entirely or almost entirely all compatibility characters (U+F900‚ÄìU+FFEF except for the nonchars). The compatibility blocks contain none of the semantically distinct compatibility characters with only one exception: the rial currency symbol (Ô∑º U+FDFC) so the compatibility decomposable characters in the compatibility blocks fall unambiguously into the set of discouraged characters. Unicode recommends authors use the plain text compatibility decomposition equivalents instead and complement those characters with rich text markup. This approach is much more flexible and open-ended than using the finite set of circled or enclosed alphanumerics to give just one example. Unfortunately, there are a small number of characters even within the compatibility blocks that themselves are not compatibility characters and therefore may confuse authors. The \\"Enclosed CJK Letters and Months\\" block contains a single non- compatibility character: the 'Korean Standard Symbol' („âø U+327F). That symbol and 12 other characters have been included in the blocks for unknown reasons. The \\"CJK Compatibility Ideographs\\" block contains these non-compatibility unified Han ideographs: # (U+FA0E): Ô®é # (U+FA0F): Ô®è # (U+FA11): Ô®ë # (U+FA13): Ô®ì # (U+FA14): Ô®î # (U+FA1F): Ô®ü # (U+FA21): Ô®° # (U+FA23): Ô®£ # (U+FA24): Ô®§ # (U+FA27): Ô®ß # (U+FA28): Ô®® # (U+FA29): Ô®© These thirteen characters are not compatibility characters, and their use is not discouraged in any way. However, U+27EAF ß∫Ø, the same as U+FA23 Ô®£, is mistakenly encoded in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B.IRGN 1218 In any event, a normalized text should never contain both U+27EAF ß∫Ø and U+FA23 Ô®£; these code points represent the same character, encoded twice. Several other characters in these blocks have no compatibility mapping but are clearly intended for legacy support: Alphabetic Presentation Forms (1) # Hebrew Point Judeo-Spanish Varika (U+FB1E): Ô¨û. This is a glyph variant of Hebrew Point Rafe (U+05BF): ÷ø, though Unicode provides no compatibility mapping. Arabic Presentation Forms (4) # \\"Ornate Left Parenthesis\\" (U+FD3E): Ô¥æ.

This is similar to other operations needed when, for example, a user performs a case or diacritic insensitive search within some text. In such cases software must equate or ignore characters it would not otherwise equate or ignore. Typically normalization is performed without altering the underlying stored text data (lossless). However, some software may potentially make permanent changes to text that eliminates the canonical or even non-canonical compatibility characters differences from text storage (lossy).

Gayler was awarded three Navy Cross medals as a World War II flying ace and is credited with five aerial victories while flying for VF-2 and VF-3. Gayler was an ardent advocate for nuclear disarmament. Early life Gayler was born in Birmingham, Alabama, entered the United States Naval Academy on June 6, 1931, and was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy on June 6, 1935. Naval career Gayler's first assignment was as an Engineering Officer on the battleship , then the destroyer , followed by service as the Gunnery Officer on the destroyer . In March 1940, Gayler entered flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, and was designated a Naval Aviator in November 1940. He was assigned to fighter squadron VF-3 in November 1940, and was credited with destroying five enemy aircraft in aerial combat. Between February and May 1942 Gayler was awarded the Navy Cross three times, the first person to achieve this. He was transferred to NAS Anacostia in Washington, D.C., in June 1942 to serve as a VF Project Officer. From June 1943 to June 1944, Gayler served as a test pilot at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. He next served as Commanding Officer of VF-12 from June 1944 to February 1945. Gayler was Air Operations Officer for the 2nd Carrier Task Force from March to November 1945. Gayler was an ardent advocate for nuclear disarmament. As a lieutenant commander and a fighter pilot, he flew over Hiroshima six days after the first atomic bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945. He was stunned and saw nothing moving, and vowed to work to eliminate nuclear weapons. Gayler then served as Executive Officer, and then Deputy Director of Special Devices Center from February 1946 to April 1948. Gayler was Operations Officer on the carrier from April 1948 to September 1949, before heading the Fighter Design Branch in Washington, D.C., from October 1949 to June 1951. Gayler was Commanding Officer of the Navy's experimental jet fighter squadron VX-III (VX-3) at Atlantic City, New Jersey, from June 1951 to January 1954. Gayler served in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations from January 1954 to January 1956, and then became Commanding Officer of the seaplane tender from January 1956 to February 1957. He was Operations Officer for the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, from February to June 1957, and then served as a Naval Aide to the Secretary of the Navy from June 1957 to April 1959. Gayler commanded the aircraft carrier from May 1959 to June 1960, and then served as the U.S. Naval Attache in London, England, from August 1960 to August 1962. Gayler was commander of Carrier Division 20 from August 1962 to August 1963, and then served as Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Development from August 1963 to August 1967. He was Deputy Director of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, from September 1967 to July 1969. Gayler became the 6th Director of the National Security Agency in July 1969, serving in that position until he became Commander in Chief of United States Pacific Command (CINCPAC) in August 1972. Gayler served as CINCPAC until his retirement from the Navy on August 31, 1976.

For example, the null character () is used in C-programming application environments to indicate the end of a string of characters. In this way, these programs only require a single starting memory address for a string (as opposed to a starting address and a length), since the string ends once the program reads the null character.  ISO 6429 control characters (C0 and C1)  The control characters U+0000‚ÄìU+001F and U+007F come from ASCII. Additionally, U+0080‚ÄìU+009F were used in conjunction with ISO 8859 character sets (among others). They are specified in ISO 6429 and often referred to as C0 and C1 control codes respectively. Most of these characters play no explicit role in Unicode text handling. The characters , , , , and are commonly used in text processing as formatting characters.  Unicode introduced separators  In an attempt to simplify the several newline characters used in legacy text, Unicode introduces its own newline characters to separate either lines or paragraphs: and . These characters are text formatting only, and not control characters.  Language tags  Unicode previously included 128 characters, now deprecated, for language tags. These characters essentially mirrored the 128 ASCII characters but were used to identify the subsequent text as belonging to a particular language according to BCP 47. For example, to indicate subsequent text as the variant of English as written in the United States, the initiating ‚ÄòLanguage Tag character‚Äô (U+E0001) followed by the sequence ‚ÄòTag Small Letter e‚Äô (U+E0065), ‚ÄòTag Small Letter n‚Äô (U+E006E), ‚ÄòTag Hyphen-minus‚Äô (U+E002D), ‚ÄòTag Small Letter u‚Äô (U+E0075) and ‚ÄòTag Small Letter s‚Äô (U+E0073) would have been used. These language tag characters would not be displayed themselves. However, they would provide information for text processing or even for the display of other characters. For example, the display of Unihan ideographs might have substituted different glyphs if the language tags indicated Korean than if the tags indicated Japanese. Another example, might have influenced the display of decimal digits 0 through 9 differently depending on the language they appeared in. The tag characters U+E0001, U+E0020‚ÄìU+E007E, and U+E007F were deprecated in Unicode 5.1 (2008) and should not be used for language information. With the release of Unicode 8.0 (2015), U+E0020‚ÄìU+E007E are no longer deprecated characters. (U+E0001 LANGUAGE TAG and U+E007F CANCEL TAG remain deprecated.) The change was made \\"to clear the way for the potential future use of tag characters for a purpose other than to represent language tags\\". Unicode states that \\"the use of tag characters to represent language tags in a plain text stream is still a deprecated mechanism for conveying language information about text.  Interlinear annotation  Three formatting characters provide support for interlinear annotation (U+FFF9 ANCHOR, U+FFFA SEPARATOR, U+FFFB TERMINATOR). This may be used for providing notes that would typically be displayed between the lines of other text. Unicode considers such annotation to be rich text and recommends using other protocols for such annotation. The W3C Ruby markup recommendation is an example of an alternate protocol supporting more advanced interlinear annotation.  Bidirectional text control  Unicode supports standard bidirectional text without any special characters. In other words Unicode conforming software should display right- to-left characters such as Hebrew letters as right-to-left simply from the properties of those characters. Similarly, Unicode handles the mixture of left-to-right-text alongside right-to-left text without any special characters. For example, one can quote Arabic (‚Äúÿ®ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá‚Äù) (translated into English as \\"Bismillah\\") right alongside English and the Arabic letters will flow from right-to-left and the Latin letters left-to-right. However, support for bidirectional text becomes more complicated when text flowing in opposite directions is embedded hierarchically, for example if one quotes an Arabic phrase that in turn quotes an English phrase. Other situations may also complicate this, such as when an author wants the left-to-right characters overridden so that they flow from right-to-left. While these situations are fairly rare, Unicode provides twelve characters (U+061C, U+200E, U+200F, U+202A, U+202B, U+202C, U+202D, U+202E, U+2066, U+2067, U+2068, U+2069) to help control these embedded bidirectional text levels up to 125 levels deep.  Variation selectors  Many characters map to alternate glyphs depending on the context. For example, Arabic and Latin cursive characters substitute different glyphs to connect glyphs together depending on whether the character is the initial character in a word, the final character, a medial character or an isolated character. These types of glyph substitution are easily handled by the context of the character with no other authoring input involved. Authors may also use special-purpose characters such as joiners and non-joiners to force an alternate form of glyph where it would not otherwise appear. Ligatures are similar instances where glyphs may be substituted simply by turning ligatures on or off as a rich text attribute. However, for other glyph substitution, the author's intent may need to be encoded with the text and cannot be determined contextually. This is the case with character/glyphs referred to as gaiji where different glyphs are used for the same character either historically or for ideographs for family names. This is one of the gray areas in distinguishing between a glyph and a character. If a family name differs slightly from the ideograph character it derives from, then is that a simple glyph variant or a character variant. As of Unicode 3.2 and 4.0, the character set now includes 256 variation selectors so that these combining mark characters can select from 256 possible character/glyph variations for the preceding character.  Control pictures  Unicode provides graphic characters for representing C0 control codes (and space and a generic newline) in the Control Pictures block. They are visual representations, not the actual control codes themselves. There are no equivalent characters for the C1 control codes.

While it is available to buy and on subscription, it is provided to all solicitors with a current England and Wales practising certificate (as well as trainee solicitors). This makes its position different from other British legal periodicals such as The Lawyer, Legal Week, Solicitors Journal, New Law Journal, Legal Business, In-House Lawyer and European Lawyer. In consequence the Gazette has by far the highest audited circulation of any legal journal in the United Kingdom (latest ABC- audited numbers are a circulation of 81,178 for June 2019). It is also the largest-circulation legal magazine in Europe. The lawgazette.co.uk website has 21,097 daily unique browsers and the Gazette Daily Update gets emailed to 182,195 recipients every weekday around lunchtime. Format and channels The Gazette has changed its format over the years, beginning as a small booklet before experimenting with an untrimmed newspaper style in 1975, in a bid to cut costs and to use the additional space to publish its backlog of material. It was then a more manageable A4-ish size until May 2018 where it was re- designed and is now styled like a magazine, with more analytical content than before. Online, the Gazette's brand ranges across two websites ‚Äì the Gazette's editorial element at Lawgazette.co.uk and the Gazette's legal jobs board at jobs.lawgazette.co.uk. The content mix on the Lawgazette.co.uk site is legal news, blogs, user comments, feature-length material, updates on specific areas of the law, user-generated listings of job moves within the profession and issues around the management of law firms. History  The Gazette was the creation of the Law Society's Registry Department as a way to communicate between the Society's members for the negotiation of sales, mortgages, partnerships and clerkships. By 1900, the Registry had also begun to amass brief notices about professional issues affecting solicitors, which the Law Society's Council felt would be of use and interest to the Society's membership. The Gazette and Register was launched in November 1903 as a convenient method to communicate this information to the Society's members. Initially it was published on a monthly basis and was only available to members of the Society. In its very first issue, the Society encouraged its members to contribute to the ‚ÄòGeneral Information‚Äô section with the instructions that contributions must be \\"strictly confined to matters of fact of general professional interest, and must not contain expressions of opinion or anything of a controversial character\\". Continuing with its main aim of encouraging and enabling communication between Law Society members, the Gazette also provided the opportunity for solicitors who were seeking positions to promote their services or vacancies to colleagues. These adverts provide interesting information about the social history of the time ‚Äì for example, an advert from 1908 offered a room in a solicitors firm for the bargain rent of ¬£38 per annum. The cost included \\"use of electric light\\". Use of the telephone was only \\"by arrangement\\". As it continues to do today, the Law Society Gazette has always provided an opportunity for solicitors to stay abreast of new advances in technology ‚Äì in 1968 it was advertising training courses in the use of computers and in 1984 it promoted a new method of 'electronic mail' known as 'fax'.

The Hindu‚ÄìArabic numeral system (base-10) is used widely in various writing systems throughout the world and all share the same semantics for denoting numbers. However, the graphemes representing the numerals differ widely from one writing system to another. To support these grapheme differences, Unicode includes encodings of these numerals within many of the script blocks. The decimal digits are repeated in 22 separate blocks. In addition to many forms of the Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals, Unicode also includes several less common numerals such as: Aegean numerals, Roman numerals, counting rod numerals, Cuneiform numerals and ancient Greek numerals. There is also a large number of typographical variations of the Arabic numerals provided for specialized mathematical use and for compatibility with earlier character sets, and also composite characters containing Arabic numerals such as ¬Ω. Numerals invariably involve composition of glyphs as a limited number of characters are composed to make other numerals. For example, the sequence 9-9-0 in Arabic numerals composes the numeral for nine hundred ninety (990). In Roman numerals, the same number is expressed by the composed numeral ‚Ö©‚ÜÄ or ‚Ö©‚ÖØ. Each of these is a distinct numeral for representing the same abstract number. The semantics of the numerals differ in particular in their composition. Hindu‚ÄìArabic digits are positional-value compositions, while the Roman numerals are sign-value and they are additive and subtractive depending on their composition. Numerals by numeric property Grouped by their numerical property as used in a text, Unicode has four values for Numeric Type. First there is the \\"not a number\\" type. Then there are decimal-radix numbers, commonly used in Western style decimals (plain 0‚Äì9), there are numbers that are not part of a decimal system such as Roman numbers, and decimal numbers in typographic context, such as encircled numbers. Not noted is a numbering like \\"A. B. C.\\" for chapter numbering. Hexadecimal digits Hexadecimal digits in Unicode are not separate characters; existing letters and numbers are used. These characters have marked Character properties \`Hex_digit=Yes\`, and \`ASCII_Hex_digit=Yes\` when appropriate. Numerals by script  Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals  The Hindu‚ÄìArabic numeral system involves ten digits representing 0‚Äì9. Unicode includes the Western Arabic numerals in the Basic Latin (or ASCII derived) block. The digits are repeated in several other scripts: Eastern Arabic, Balinese, Bengali, Devanagari, Ethiopic, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Telugu, Khmer, Lao, Limbu, Malayalam, Mongolian, Myanmar, New Tai Lue, Nko, Oriya, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Osmanya. Unicode includes a numeric value property for each digit to assist in collation and other text processing operations. However, there is no mapping between the various related digits. Note that although Arabic is written from right to left, while English is written left to right, in both languages numbers are written with the most significant digit on the left and the least significant on the right.  Fractions  The fraction slash character (U+2044) allows authors using Unicode to compose any arbitrary fraction along with the decimal digits. This was intended to instruct font rendering to make the surrounding digits smaller and raise them on the left and lower them on the right, but this is rarely implemented (a workaround is to use the super/subscript characters described below but only Arabic numerals are available). Unicode also includes a handful of vulgar fractions as compatibility characters, but discourages their use.  Decimal fractions  Several characters in Unicode can serve as a decimal separator depending on the locale. Decimal fractions are represented in text as a sequence of decimal digit numerals with a decimal separator separating the whole-number portion from the fractional portion. For example, the decimal fraction for \\"¬º\\" is expressed as zero-point- two-five (\\"0.25\\"). Unicode has no dedicated general decimal separator but unifies the decimal separator function with other punctuation characters. So the \\".\\" used in \\"0.25\\" is the same period character (U+002E) used to end the sentence. However, cultures vary in the glyph or grapheme used for a decimal separator. So in some locales, the comma (U+002C) may be used instead \\"0,25\\". Still other locales use a space (or non-breaking space) for \\"0 25\\". The Arabic writing system includes a dedicated character for a decimal separator that looks much like a comma \\"Ÿ´\\" (U+066B) which when combined with the Arabic digits to express one-quarter appears as: \\"Ÿ†Ÿ´Ÿ¢Ÿ•\\".  Characters for mathematical constants  Currently, three Unicode characters semantically represent mathematical constants: , the , and . Other mathematical constants can be represented using characters that have multiple semantic uses. For example, although Unicode includes a character for natural exponent ‚ÑØ (U+212F) its UCS canonical name derives from its glyph: ; and the mathematical constant œÄ, 3.141592.., is represented by .  Rich text and other compatibility numerals  The Western Arabic numerals also appear among the compatibility characters as rich text variant forms including bold, double-struck, monospace, sans-serif and sans-serif bold, along with fullwidth variants for legacy vertical text support. Rich text parenthesized, circled and other variants are also included in the blocks: Enclosed CJK Letters and Months; Enclosed Alphanumerics, Superscripts and Subscripts; Number Forms; and Dingbats.  CJK Suzhou (huƒÅm«é) numerals The huƒÅm«é system is a variation of the rod numeral system. Rod numerals are closely related to the counting rods and the abacus, which is why the numeric symbols for 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 in the huƒÅm«é system are represented in a similar way as on the abacus. Nowadays, the huƒÅm«é system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.  Suzhou (huƒÅm«é) numerals in Unicode  According to the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are called Hangzhou style numerals. This indicates that it is not used only by Cantonese in Hong Kong. In the Unicode standard 4.0, an erratum was added which stated: The digits of the Suzhou numerals are designated in the CJK Symbols and Punctuation block between U+3021 and U+3029, U+3007, U+5341, U+5344, and. U+5345.  Japanese and Korean numerals   Ancient Greek numerals  Unicode provides support for several variants of Greek numerals, assigned to the Supplementary Multilingual Plane from U+10140 through U+1018F.Unicode Charts: Ancient Greek Numbers Attic numerals were used by ancient Greeks, possibly from the 7th century BC. They were also known as Herodianic numerals because they were first described in a 2nd-century manuscript by Herodian. They are also known as acrophonic numerals because all of the symbols used derive from the first letters of the words that the symbols represent: 'one', 'five', 'ten', 'hundred', 'thousand' and 'ten thousand'. See Greek numerals and acrophony. { - !Decimal !Symbol !Greek numeral - 1 Œô ·º¥ŒøœÇ or ·º∞œåœÇ (ios) - 5 Œ† œÄŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒµ (pente) - 10 Œî Œ¥Œ≠Œ∫Œ± (deka) - 100 Œó ·ºëŒ∫Œ±œÑœåŒΩ (hekaton) - 1000 Œß œáŒØŒªŒπŒøŒπ (khilioi) - 10000 Œú ŒºœçœÅŒπŒøŒπ (myrioi) }  Roman numerals  Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome, adapted from Etruscan numerals. The system used in classical antiquity was slightly modified in the Middle Ages to produce the system we use today. It is based on certain letters which are given values as numerals. Roman numerals are commonly used today in numbered lists (in outline format), clockfaces, pages preceding the main body of a book, chord triads in music analysis (Roman numeral analysis), the numbering of movie and video game sequels, book publication dates, successive political leaders or children with identical names, and the numbering of some sport events, such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Unicode has a number of characters specifically designated as Roman numerals, as part of the Number FormsUnicode Number Forms range from U+2160 to U+2188. This range includes both upper- and lowercase numerals, as well as pre-combined characters for numbers up to 12 (‚Ö´ or XII). One reason for the existence of pre-combined numbers is to facilitate the setting of multiple-letter numbers (such as VIII) on a single horizontal line in Asian vertical text. The Unicode standard, however, includes special Roman numeral code points for compatibility only, stating that \\"[f]or most purposes, it is preferable to compose the Roman numerals from sequences of the appropriate Latin letters\\". Additionally, characters exist for archaic forms of 1000, 5000, 10,000, large reversed C (∆Ü), late 6 (‚ÜÖ, similar to Greek Stigma: œö), early 50 (‚ÜÜ, similar to down arrow ‚Üì‚´ù‚ä•David J. Perry: Proposal to Add Additional Ancient Roman Characters to UCS), 50,000, and 100,000. Note that the small reversed c, ‚ÜÑ, is not intended to be used in Roman numerals, but as lower case Claudian letter ‚ÜÉ. {  + Table of Roman numerals in Unicode - !

Historically, red rods were used for positive numbers and black rods for negative numbers.  Counting rod numerals in Unicode  Counting rod numerals are included in their own block in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP) from U+1D360 to U+1D37F. Eighteen characters for vertical and horizontal digits of 1‚Äì9 are included as of Unicode 5.0, though vertical and horizontal are opposite from the description above. Fourteen code points reserved for future use. Zero should be represented by U+3007 („Äá, ideographic number zero) and the negative sign should be represented by U+20E5 (combining reverse solidus overlay). As these were recently added to the character set and since they are included in the SMP, font support may still be limited.

Biography  Primrose Cuming was the youngest of a family of two girls and a boy, and was born on the Isle of Thanet, Kent, in 1915 during the First World War. She was educated by a governess, who recognised her flair for writing. Her first story, about the travelling adventures of an ant, was published in Nursery World. She said: > ‚ÄúI found it tremendously exciting writing about the country things I knew, > and being paid for it ‚Äì even if I did collect piles of rejection slips, > too!‚Äú Badger, iii The first book Primrose had published was Doney (Country Life 1934), which reflected her love of ponies. She was, she said, > ‚Äúso keen on riding at this time, that I used to steal out early in the > morning and ride the farmers‚Äô horses in the fields. Then I wrote a book > about my friend‚Äôs pony, Doney, and sold it. With the money, I bought Black > Jack ‚Äì who was rather too spirited for a beginner. When I took him hunting, > he broke his bridle and off I came ‚Äì in front of the whole field. At last we > got on better terms and we both made our names by jumping everything in his > path. To feed Black Jack, I wrote more books about country life, drawing on > my own knowledge and experience. I had several published by the time I was > 21.‚Äù The published dates of Primrose Cummings‚Äô books make it likely that these were Spider Dog (1935), and perhaps Silver Snaffles, which presumably was accepted for publication by the time she was 21: it was published in 1936, when she was 22. Primrose Cumming still wrote during World War II, but also did war work, working for a year on a farm.Badger, vii One day a bomber crashed in the same field as the sheep she was looking after, but she survived, and her experience on the farm led directly to her book Owl's Castle Farm. Later she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and served for the remainder of the war in an anti-aircraft battery. Between air-raids, she wrote The Great Horses. This is the only one of her books of that period which is not set firmly in her own experience: it is an historical fiction, tracing the experiences of a line of heavy horses over several centuries.Badger, viii After the war, she had a temporary job as under-matron in a boys‚Äô school. This was not a success, as she saw the boys‚Äô side rather more easily than the masters‚Äô. She returned to her family home in East Sussex, and decided to stick to writing and gardening. Horses were by no means her only interest: she was an expert flower arranger, and exhibited at the local flower shows and the Chelsea Flower Show. The books she published in her later years were based less closely on her own experiences. After parting company with J. M. Dent in the late 1960s, Primrose Cumming carried on writing for D. C. Thomson & Co., the magazine publishers, on many subjects and also contributed short stories to several editions of The Pony Club Annual. She stopped writing in the 1960s, feeling that she was becoming out of touch with modern youth. Primrose Cumming died in 2004. None of her books are currently in print, but Fidra Books republished Silver Snaffles, which appeared in late 2007.

They belong to the superfamily Anareolatae of suborder Verophasmatodea. Like many of their relatives, the Phasmatidae are capable of regenerating limbs and commonly reproduce by parthenogenesis. Despite their bizarre, even threatening appearance, they are harmless to humans. The Phasmatidae contain some of the largest insects in existence. The recently discovered Chan's megastick (Phobaeticus chani) of the Clitumninae (sometimes placed in the Phasmatinae) can grow to a total length of over ; it is the longest living insect known. Subfamilies Following the Phasmid Study Group, nine subfamilies are recognized in the Phasmatidae. Other treatments differ, sometimes recognizing as few as six. The Lonchodinae were historically often placed in the Diapheromeridae, the other family of the Anareolatae. The Phasmatinae are often expanded to include the two tribes here separated as the Clitumninae, while the Extatosomatinae may be similarly included in the Tropidoderinae as a tribe.

Spanish-style bullfighting is a type of bullfighting that is practiced in Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, as well as in parts of southern France and Portugal. This style of bullfighting involves a physical contest with humans (and other animals) attempting to publicly subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull. The most common bull used is the Spanish Fighting Bull (Toro Bravo), a type of cattle native to the Iberian Peninsula. This style of bullfighting is seen to be both a sport and performance art. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition ‚Äì bulls are color blind. They attack moving objects; the brightly-colored cape is used to mask blood stains. In a traditional corrida, three toreros (or matadores) each fight against two out of a total of six fighting bulls to death, each bull being at least four years old and weighs up to about (with a minimum weight limit of ). Bullfighting season in Spain runs from March to October. The practice is also known as a corrida de toros (\\"bull-running\\"), tauromaquia, or fiesta. Since the late-1980s, bullfighting in Spain has declined in popularity due to animal welfare concerns, its association with blood sport, and its links to nationalism.  History  El Cid Campeador lanceando otro toro by Francisco Goya, 1816 Pre-Roman Most historians trace festivities involving bulls to prehistorical times, as a trend that once extended through the entire Mediterranean coast and has just survived in Iberia and part of France. Early bullfights had a high mortality rate. Alejandro Recio, a Spanish historian, considers the Neolithic city of Konya, Turkey, discovered by James Mellaart in 1958, as evidence of sacrificial tauromaquia associated with traditional rituals. This claim is based on the abundance of representations of bulls, as well as on the preservation of horns and bullheads attached to walls. Since then various archeological findings have proven the uninterrupted importance of the bull as a symbol of the sun for the Iberian cults, like the presence of berracos (known in Portuguese as berr√£o), or the importance of the bull in the surviving Celtiberian and Celtic rituals that continued into the 21st century. These pre-roman religions centered on the ritual sacrifice of sacred animals through direct or symbolic combat and was a likely motive for the depiction of bulls.(1999) ‚ÄúCosmogon√≠a v√©dica del numantino Vaso de Los Toros‚Äù, en Revista de Soria n¬∫25, Diputaci√≥n Provincial de Soria Roman Bullrings are believed to originate their bullfighting tradition from Roman gladiator games. During Roman Hispania gladiators were forced to fight by sword bulls, bears, and wolves. The Romans tried to abolish and ban the \\"puere\\" practice of bullfighting, considering it was too risky for the youth and not a proper way to worship the state deities.LORRIO ALVARADO, A. y OLIVARES PEDRE√ëO, J.C. (2004): ‚ÄúImagen y simbolismo del toro en la Hispania c√©ltica‚Äù, en Revista de Estudios Taurinos n.¬∫ 18, Sevilla Arab prohibition During the Arab rule of Iberia, the ruling class tried to ban the practice of bullfighting, considering it a pagan celebration and heresy. Bullfighting was illegal in all Arab territory but became a mark of identity and resistance for Christian Iberians, especially for the nobility that started using it as a way to gain prestige. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy; in contests the fighters were referred to as rejoneadors. Catholic excommunication Enrique Simonet's La suerte de varas (1899) depicts Spanish-style bullfighting in a bullring in Madrid, Spain. The painting illustrates the first-stage of this type of bullfighting. In the 16th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger it posed to the participants. Anyone who would sponsor, watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the Church. Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly, and his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, took efforts to relax this penalty.EXCOMUNI√ìN A PERPETUIDAD San P√≠o V: Bula ¬´DE SALUTIS GREGIS DOMINICI¬ª (1567) ¬´Bullarum Diplomatum et Privilegiorum Sanctorum Romanorum Pontificum Taurinensis editio¬ª, Vol VII, Augustae Taurinorum 1862, pages 630-631 Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as way to honor Jesus Christ or the Saints, as was typical in Spain and Portugal. The Bourbons King Philip V, the first King of Spain of Bourbon descent, ended bullfighting in the country because he believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport. The change in bullfighting standards ran parallel to the discontent of the foreign rule of the Bourbons, and their lack of interest in understanding the politics, economics or culture of their new kingdom culminated in the Esquilache Riots of 1766. New forms of bullfighting continued to develop despite anti-French and anti-nobility sentiments. After growing in popularity in Spain, King Carlos III attempted to ban bullfighting in 1771. He attempted to reduce the social tension by building two of the eldest and largest bullfighting rings in Madrid as part of an offensive to fix the hostility and alienation that the Spanish felt towards the French rulers. King Charles IV attempted to formally ban the sport again after his predecessor made concessions. King Joseph Bonaparte reversed this decision by hosting a bullfight during his coronation in 1808.  Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez Costillares  Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez Costillares (1743‚Äì1800) was a Spanish bullfighter from Seville who has been credited with founding modern Spanish-style bullfighting. He established the \\"cuadrillas tradition\\" where teams of two or three banderilleros and two picadors taunt the bull. He also organized the tercios de lidia (\\"thirds of fight\\") borrowed from the theatre; invented the Veronica and other basic cape movements as well as the current traje de luces (\\"suit of light\\"); and created the cape maneuvers (muleta), typical in this style of bullfighting since the 19th century.  Participants  Each matador has six assistants‚Äîtwo picadores (\\"lancers\\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros (\\"flagmen\\"), and a mozo de espada (\\"the lad of the swords\\"). Collectively they compose a cuadrilla or team of bullfighters. The crew also includes an ayuda (aide to sword servant) and subalternos (subordinates) including at least two peones (pages, singular pe√≥n).  Parts of a bullfight  The capote (alt= The modern Spanish-style bullfight (corrida) is highly standardized, with three distinct parts (or tercios), the start of each of which is announced by a trumpet sound. The participants first enter the arena in a parade (pase√≠llo) to salute the presiding dignitary (presidente), usually accompanied by band music. The corrida begins to the tune of live-played pasodobles, many of which were composed to honour famous toreros. Torero costumes are influenced by 17th century Andalusian clothing. Matadors are distinguished by a \\"suit of lights\\" (traje de luces), custom-made and embroidered with silver or golden thread. The bull then enters the ring to be tested for aggressiveness by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (dress cape). Bulls are raised on the open range by specialist breeding estates called ganader√≠a. The bull enters the arena with a rosette on its back bearing the colours of the estate of its origin.  Stage 1: Tercio de Varas  The first stage is called the tercio de varas (\\"part of lances\\"). The matador observes how the bull reacts to the waving of the banderilleros' cloak. They also note vision problems, unusual head movements, or if the bull favors a part of the ring called a (territory). A bull trying to reach its querencia is often more dangerous than a bull that is attacking the cape directly. The initial attack by the matador is called the suerte de capote (\\"act of the cape\\"), and there are a number of fundamental \\"lances\\" (or passes) that matadors make; the most common being the ver√≥nica (named after Saint Veronica), which is the act of a matador letting their cloak trail over the bull's head as it runs past. Then two picadores enter the arena each armed with a lance (vara), mounted on large heavily-padded and blindfolded horses. The entrance of the horse attracts the bull to the picadores. The picador stabs a mound of muscle (morrillo) on the bull's neck, drawing blood and animating the animal. As the picador stabs at the bull's neck, the bull charges and attempts to lift the picador's horse. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns lower in a show of aggression during the following stages of the fight. This makes the bull less dangerous while enabling the matador to perform the passes of modern bullfighting. In a mandatory step in the corrida, regulations require that a plaza judge ensures a certain number of hits are made before it is considered completed.  Stage 2: Tercio de Banderillas  In the next stage ‚Äì the tercio de banderillas (\\"part of small flag\\") ‚Äì the matador attempts to plant two barbed or dart-like sticks known as banderillas (\\"little flags\\") onto the bull's shoulders. These weaken the ridges of neck and shoulder muscle (which set fighting bulls apart from cattle) through loss of blood, while also spurring the bull into making more aggressive charges. By this point the bull has lost a significant amount of blood, exhausting the animal. The matador then enters with his cape and sword, attempting to tire the bull further with several runs at the cape.The tercio de banderillas, 2004. The matadors place the banderillas around the bull. If the presidente decides that the bull is relatively weak or unwilling to fight, they may order the use of black banderillas, considered to be a poor reflection on the breeder. Bull in the arena with banderillas hanging down on shoulders, 2005.  Stage 3: Tercio de Muerte  Matador in the tercio de muerte, 2005. In the third and final stage ‚Äì the tercio de muerte (\\"part of death\\") ‚Äì the matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape or muleta in one hand and a sword (estoc) in the other. This cape is stretched with a wooden dowel and, in right-handed passes, the sword as well. Having dedicated the bull to an individual or the whole audience, the matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, demonstrating their control over it. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition ‚Äì bulls are color blind. As bulls attack moving objects; colored capes are used to mask blood stains. The faena is the entire performance combined with the muleta, which is usually broken down into a series of tandas (episodes). A typical tanda consists of three to five basic passes and then the finishing touch (remate), such as a pase de pecho, or pase de desprecio. Well-received passes are celebrated by the audience with shouts of \\"¬°ole!\\". The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a attempts to manoeuvre the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The entire part of the bullfight with the is called the tercio de muerte (\\"third of death\\") or suerte de muleta (\\"act of muleta\\"). The act of thrusting the sword (estoca or estoque) is called an estocada. A clumsy estocada that fails to give a \\"quick and clean death\\" will often raise loud protests from the crowd and may ruin the whole performance. If estocada is not successful, the matador must then perform a and cut the bull's spinal cord with a second sword called verdugo, to kill it instantly and spare the animal pain. Although the matador's final blow is usually fatal, it may take the bull some time to die. A coup de gr√¢ce is therefore administered by a named a , using a dagger to further pierce the spinal cord. The matador must kill the bull in 15 minutes after the first pass, at most. After 10 minutes, if the bull is still alive, the will order an , a warning given with a trumpet sound. If a further three minutes elapse, a second will be given; a third and final is given after a further two minutes. The presidente will then give an order to have the bull returned to its pen (), or, if local law so requires, to have the bull killed outside the ring. It is a dishonor for the failing matador. The bull's body is dragged out by a team of mules. If the is impressed by the performance of the bull, he orders a tour around the ring to honour the animal. Very rarely, a bull will be allowed to survive a fight as an indulgence granted in recognition of an exceptional performance. The spectators will demand an from the , by waving handkerchiefs before the . The matador will stop and look at the . If he stands still, he will resume their action and kill the bull. But if he has an orange handkerchief hung on his balcony, the matador will imitate the with a or with the palm of his hand and the bull will be \\"freed\\". Such bulls are generally retired from competition and raised as studs, as their experience in the ring makes them extremely dangerous opponents. A fighting bull is never used in the ring twice, because they learn from experience, and the entire strategy of the matador is based on the assumption that the bull has not learned from previous experience. This also invalidates bulls who have been run in their estate by illegal fighters (), who in earlier times would sneak into an estate by night to practice their skills. A (trophy) is the usual indicator of a successful . When the records of bullfights are kept, earned by the matador are always mentioned. If the crowd demands, the matador is allowed to take a lap of victory around the ring. If at least half of the spectators petition the by waving handkerchiefs, the is obliged to award the matador with one ear of the bull. To award the matador with another ear or with two ears and the tail (), depends solely on the 's appreciation. A matador who won at least two ears is given the permission to be carried on the shoulders of the admirers (). In some cities, such as Seville, three matadors take on two bulls each, and is only available to a matador that wins a total of three between his two bulls. In general, a matador that faces a bull that is freed is usually awarded , although only symbolically; ears or the tail can only be physically cut off of a dead bull.  Hazards  Bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, and it is dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common. The suertes with the capote are risky, but it is the faena, in particular the estocada, that is the most dangerous. A matador of classical (Manolete) style is trained to divert the bull with the muleta but to come close to the right horn as he makes the fatal sword-thrust between the scapulae and through the aorta. At this moment, the danger to the matador is the greatest. Most matadors have been gored many times. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn- wounds. The bullring normally has an infirmary with an operating room, reserved for the immediate treatment of matadors with cornadas. The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case an emergency sacrament of extreme unction (also known as Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites) is needed.  Popularity  300pxthumb Spanish-style bullfighting around the world: Note: Some municipalities have banned bullfighting in countries and regions where it is otherwise legal. A poll conducted in 2014‚Äì2015 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture places bullfighting 10th in the list of most popular paid leisure activities. In 2015 9.5% of Spaniards went to a paid bullfight. By Autonomous Communities, Navarre headed the list, followed by Castile-Leon, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. The regions least interested in bullfighting were Galicia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. According to the poll, during the 2014‚Äì15 period 9.5% of the potential audience (Spaniards aged 15 and higher) would have attended a corrida at least once; this amounts to over 3.5 million people.  Women in bullfighting  The history of female bullfighters participating in Spanish-style bullfighting has been traced to the sport's earliest renditions, namely during the late-1700s and early 1800s. Francisco Goya, an 18th century Spanish painter, first depicted a female bullfighter in his work La Pajuelera, which featured a woman sparing with a bull on horseback. The Spanish government banned women from participating in the sport from 1909 to 1934, following the Second Spanish Republic's liberation of women until 1939. On 10 August 1974, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, women were once again allowed to bullfight. Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Hern√°ndez G√≥mez was the first woman to earn her bullfighting license (torera) after the ban was lifted. During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, women were forced to exile in other Spanish-speaking countries and the United States in order to continue bullfighting. Throughout the 1980s women had difficulty completing their alternativa, a ceremony where a bullfighter becomes a matador, due to the social pressures of the decade.  Anti- bullfighting movement  Prevalence of bullfighting across Spanish provinces during the 19th century. Prevalence of bullfighting across Spanish provinces during the 21st century. Activism against bullfighting has existed in Spain since the beginning of the early 19th century, when a group of intellectuals, pertaining to the Generation of '98, rallied against the popularity of bullfighting and flamenco music, dismissing them as \\"non-European\\" elements of Spanish culture which were to blame for the country's social and economic backwardness. Since in the 20th century, bullfighting has come under increasing attack from animal rights activists and political actors for its links to nationalism. Separatist and nationalist sentiment in Catalonia has played a key role in the region wide ban of a practice which is strongly associated to Spanish national identity. Galician and Basque nationalists have also expressed abolitionist stances, although in the case of the latter this has been somewhat mooted by the conundrum of bullfighting being at the heart of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona. Animal welfare concerns are perhaps the prime driver of opposition to bullfighting outside Spain, although rejection of traditionalism and Criollo elitism may also play a role in Latin America. Animal rights activists claim bullfighting is a cruel or barbarous blood sport, in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death. A number of animal rights or animal welfare activist groups such as Antitauromaquia and StopOurShame undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries. Alexander Fiske-Harrison, \\"a postgraduate student of both philosophy and biology\\",France, Miranda, \\"'Blood, Sweat and Tears: Into the Arena: The World of the Spanish Bullfight\\", Literary Review, 389, July 2011 who trained as a bullfighter to research for a book on the subject, has argued that there are mitigating circumstances to this: > In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years > whereas the meat cow lives one to two. What is more, it doesn‚Äôt just live in > the sense of existing, it lives a full and natural life. Those years are > spent free, roaming in the dehesa, the lightly wooded natural pastureland > which is the residue of the ancient forests of Spain. It is a rural idyll, > although with the modern additions of full veterinary care and an absence of > predators big enough to threaten evolution‚Äôs answer to a main battle tank. Other arguments include those to the effect that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is often much worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight).Fiske-Harrison, Alexander, \\"Perhaps bullfighting is not a moral wrong: My talk at the Edinburgh International Book Festival\\", The Last Arena: In Search Of The Spanish Bullfight blog. 25 July 2012 The last common defense to the practice is the conservationist stance point for both the tradition itself and the Bravo bull variety. Bravo bulls are the closest living relative to the European wild bull, completely extinct now and divided into sub-breeds whose only use is provision of meat, serving the alimentary industry. Without bullfighting and bull spectacles, the last wild bull in Europe is doomed to disappear. The straightforward supporters question the actual pain the bull may be in, considering the factor of adrenaline, and especially consider how the death of cattle tends to be, and repeat the less than 30 seconds death the animal suffers in the end. After years of increased pressure against bullfighting by abolitionist movements within Spain, the death of bullfighter Victor Barrio in July 2016 led to hundreds of comments being posted on various social media expressing joy towards the event and openly mocking his family and widow. This led to a significant backlash within Spain against anti- bullfighting activism, and criminal investigations are ongoing against those involved. Within a few days of Barrio's death, over 200,000 signatures had been collecting demanding action be taken against one such activist.

In the final stage, the rejoneador kills the bull with a rej√≥n de muerte (lance of death). On some occasions, the rejoneador will kill the bull on foot in the traditional way with muleta and estoca. * The recortes: A bullfighter dodges around the bull and does not use a cape or sword. Bulls are not killed during this type of bullfight. Most specialists in this form of bullfighting come from Aragon. * Comedy spectacles, such as El bombero torero y los enanitos toreros (\\"The bullfighting fireman and the bullfighting dwarves\\").  Amateur  * The encierro: A \\"running\\" of the bulls through the streets. Customarily, runners run before the bulls to guide them from the pen to the plaza, where the bulls will await the afternoon's bullfight. The most famous is that of Pamplona in July, although encierros exist in towns throughout Spain. It is a dangerous activity, and care should be taken by those who wish to participate. In Segorbe, bulls are herded to the bullring by riders on horseback, an event called Entrada de toros y caballos, which is a tourist attraction. * The bous al carrer (bulls at the street in Catalan) commonly found in Comunidad Valenciana and some places in Catalonia. The main difference from a encierro is that the bulls aren't directed to any bullring ** A Mediterranean variation, called bous a la mar (bulls at the sea), takes place on a dock. The youths jump into the water when the cow has cornered them. One place famous for this festivity is D√©nia ** Another variation is the toro embolado (\\"fire bull\\"). This fiesta takes place at midnight. Balls of flammable material or actual fireworks are placed on the horns. The bull is set free on the street where young men dodge and run away from the charging animal * The Toro de la Vega: This takes place in September at Tordesillas. A bull is run through an open area and over a bridge across the Duero River.

Six lists were able to win seats: an alliance of the centre-right Union for French Democracy and the Gaullist Rally for the Republic, the Socialist Party, the Left Radical Party, the French Communist Party, the National Front and Philippe de Villiers' eurosceptic right-wing dissident UDF list, which formed the Majorit√© pour l'autre Europe. 53.5% of the French population turned out on election day, actually an improvement on the last election in 1989. The Greens, who were weakened by an Ecology Generation list led by Brice Lalonde (winning 2.01%) and also suffering from internal divisions between the party's left (who wanted an electoral alliance with the So√©cialists and the left) and the right (rejecting all alliances), lost all 9 seats won in 1989. Arlette Laguiller's Trotskyst Workers' Struggle (2.27%), Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement's left-wing eurosceptic Citizens' Movement (2.54%), the L'Europe commence √† Sarajevo List (1.57%) and the agrarian populist Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Traditions (3.96%) were among the notable lists which did not pass the 5% threshold. With 14.49%, the Socialists, the party of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, whose list was led by Michel Rocard suffered its worst result ever in a European election, losing votes mainly to the Radical list led by wealthy businessman and a prot√©g√© of Mitterrand, Bernard Tapie. Most analysts agreed that Mitterrand supported Tapie's list behind the scenes, since Rocard was a personal rival of Mitterrand and he wished to destroy Rocard's chances in the 1995 presidential election. In fact, Rocard resigned as First Secretary of the PS shortly thereafter and did not run in 1995 ‚Äì Lionel Jospin was the Socialist candidate. The other surprise was Philippe de Villiers success. Villiers, the President of the General Council of Vend√©e, was a eurosceptic member of the liberal component (PR) of the pro-European UDF. He won a surprisingly strong 12.34%, and his thirteen MEPs formed the nucleus of the Europe of Nations group.

He played college football for the University of Washington, and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Washington Redskins, and Atlanta Falcons.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/G/GoldDa99.htm Early life Goldson was born in Carson, California. He started playing football with the Tri-City Falcons which is a Pop Warner team in Harbor City, California. He played high school football at Narbonne High School in Harbor City, CA where as a senior he totaled 130 tackles and six interceptions, with two returned for touchdowns. College career Goldson enrolled at the University of Washington, where he played for the Washington Huskies football team from 2003 to 2006. He played in 43 games and recorded a total of 293 tackles, six interceptions, two forced fumbles and one sack. He graduated from the University of Washington in June 2006 with a degree in American Ethnic Studies. Professional career San Francisco 49ers Goldson was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round (126th overall) in the 2007 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, he played in ten games, recording 15 tackles as a backup to then-starting safety Mark Roman. In his second year with the 49ers, Goldson recorded 21 tackles as a backup. 2009 season In 2009, the 49ers front office announced that Goldson would be the starter for free safety going into next season, while giving current starter Mark Roman permission to seek a trade. Although at the time this move was highly questioned, Goldson quickly proved doubters wrong. Goldson made his NFL debut as a starter against the divisional rival Arizona Cardinals on September 13, where the 49ers were victorious on the season opener, winning 20‚Äì16 against the reigning NFC conference champions. In Week 2, Goldson recorded his first career interception by diving under a pass that was tipped by Nate Burleson. The 2009 season would prove to be a productive season, where Goldson led all San Francisco defenders in interceptions with four, and he also forced three fumbles. Goldson finished his first year as an NFL starter with 94 tackles, two sacks, six pass defenses and four interceptions. This was the beginning of Goldson's arrival in the league. 2010 season Goldson at 49ers training camp in 2010. Goldson struggled during much of the 2010 season, missing tackles and not forcing turnovers like he did in 2009, finishing with 59 tackles and one interception. Although the San Francisco 49ers team as a whole struggled this year, they showed strides leading up to the 2011 campaign. 2011 season Prior to the 2011 season, Goldson was an unrestricted free agent and visited with the New England Patriots. He ultimately decided to sign a one-year contract and re-sign with the 49ers. He was named to his first career Pro Bowl, coming in second in the NFC in voting behind Earl Thomas. He had a career-high 6 interceptions and 9 pass deflections during the regular season and is now known to be one of the hardest hitting safeties in the NFL. In the playoffs, he intercepted a Drew Brees pass and returned it near the goal line which resulted in an Alex Smith touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree to give the 49ers a first-quarter 14‚Äì0 lead. 2012 season On October 26, 2012, Goldson was fined $7,875 for taunting the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7. On December 20, 2012, he was fined $77,500 for uniform violations and a helmet-to-helmet collision with Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez. In the 2012 season, Goldson and the 49ers appeared in Super Bowl XLVII. In the game, he had nine combined tackles as the 49ers fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 31‚Äì34. He was named to the Pro Bowl and was named to the All-Pro team for the first time in his career. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2013 season On March 13, 2013, Goldson signed a five-year, $41.25 million contract, including $22 million guaranteed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He joins newly arrived cornerback Darrelle Revis and 43rd overall draft pick Johnthan Banks.http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000150408/article/dashon-goldson- agrees-to-contract-with-tampa-bay-buccaneers On September 16, 2013, Goldson was suspended for one game for his helmet-to-helmet hit on New Orleans Saints running back Darren Sproles the previous day. Upon appeal, however, the suspension was overturned and Goldson's penalty for the hit reduced to a $100,000 fine. 2014 season In 2014, Goldson recorded 81 combined tackles, of which 63 were solo. Washington Redskins 2015 season On April 3, 2015, Goldson was traded to the Washington Redskins, along with a seventh round pick, for a sixth round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. At the start of the 2015 season, he was voted as the team's defensive captain. Goldson was released on March 7, 2016 after just one season with the team. Atlanta Falcons 2016 season On August 28, 2016, Goldson was signed by the Atlanta Falcons to fill a backup role due to safety Keanu Neal injuring his knee. In four games, Goldson made one tackle, coming in a 24‚Äì26 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 6. On October 19, 2016, he was released by the Falcons. On December 20, 2016, he was re-signed by the Falcons. Goldson was inactive for the Falcons' 28‚Äì34 overtime loss to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.

It reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart.

The apparently meaningless title appears in the song's chorus: \\"Hobart paving, don't you think that's it's time, / On this platform with the drizzle in my eyes?\\" The title may derive from a construction firm called Hobart Paving Company Limited See Hobart Paving website in the town of Croydon, where two of the band members grew up.

A sting is usually a long shaft attaching to the downstream end of the model so that it does not much disturb the flow over the model. The rear end of a sting usually has a conical fairing blending into the (wind tunnel) model support structure. For minimum aerodynamic interference a sting should be as long as possible and have as small a diameter as possible, within the structural safety limits. Critical length of a sting (beyond which its influence on the flow around the model is small) is mostly dependent on Reynolds number. If the flow at the rear end of a model (model base) is laminar, the critical sting length can be as much as 12-15 base diameters.A.Pope, \\"Wind Tunnel Calibration Techniques\\", AGARDograph 54, AGARD, 1961 If the flow at model base is turbulent, critical sting length reduces to 3-5 model base diameters. Source also suggests a sting diameter of no more than about 30% of model base diameter. However, this may not be possible in wind tunnels with high dynamic pressures because large aerodynamic loads would cause unacceptably large deflections and/or stresses in the sting. Shorter stings of larger relative diameters must be used in such cases. A good rule-of-thumb is that, for acceptably low and test-conditions-independent aerodynamic interference in a high-Reynolds-number, high-dynamic-pressure wind tunnel, a sting should have a diameter \\"d\\" not larger than 30% to 50% of model base diameter \\"D\\" and should have a length \\"L\\" of at least three model base diameters, e.g. as specified for the AGARD-C calibration modelWind Tunnel Calibration Models, AGARD Specification 2, AGARD, 1958), see figure. If the test object (model) is to be placed at high angles of attack relative to the airstream (i.e. at an attitude beyond the operating range of the model support mechanism), a bent sting can be used, see figure. Bent stings usually produce higher aerodynamic interference than straight stings. If the test object (model) has a \\"boattail\\" rear end without a well-defined base through which a sting shaft can enter the model, a so-called Z-sting can be used, having a form reminiscent of the Latin letter \\"Z\\". The part of the sting entering the model is a thin aerodynamically shaped blade so as to minimize disturbance of the flow; see figure. Stings often attach, at the front end, to internal wind tunnel balances to measure the forces on the model. Therefore, most stings have a central bore through which the cables from a balance or other in-model instrumentation can be conducted without exposure to the airflow. When a model is mounted on a wind tunnel balance attached to a sting, care must be taken that no parts of the model touch the sting during a wind tunnel test; the only support of the model must be through the balance.

After leaving coaching, he then became a general manager for two indoor soccer clubs in Cleveland, Ohio. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. Youth Miller was born in Lebanon, Pennsylvania and grew up in Ono, Pennsylvania. He attended East Stroudsburg State College where he played on both the soccer and basketball teams. He was a midfielder who earned second team All American recognition in 1958 and 1959. Coaching Collegiate While he starred as a soccer and basketball player, his first job was as the Albright College golf coach. He gained his first soccer coaching position with New Paltz State. He spent five years with the New Paltz, winning three New York Conference Championships. In 1967, Hartwick College hired Miller. In his six seasons at Hartwick, he took the team to a 64-12-3 record and a 1970 Final Four appearance. NASL Several events led to Miller moving from the collegiate to the professional coaching ranks. Tom McCloskey, a wealthy Philadelphia businessman was interested in owning a professional sports team. While attending the 1973 Super Bowl, Lamar Hunt broached the subject of McCloskey starting a North American Soccer League (NASL) franchise in Philly. The NASL awarded McCloskey a team to begin play in the 1973 season. With very little time to prepare, McCloskey, and his general manager Bob Ehlinger, hired Miller who was both a successful collegiate soccer coach and from the Philadelphia area, as the Philadelphia Atoms first coach. Miller decided to build the Atoms around a core of native U.S. players. This was significant in that most NASL teams used U.S. players as goalkeepers or bench warmers. Miller took Bob Rigby with the first pick in the 1973 NASL college draft. Rigby went on to become one of the best goalkeepers in the NASL. In the second round, Miller selected Bobby Smith who was selected as a second team All Star his rookie year. Miller then took his team to England to train. While there noticed several players who he thought could help his team. He negotiated an on loan arrangement for Andy Provan, Jim Fryatt and Chris Dunleavy. The selection of Miller proved to be a significant advantage for the Atoms. His decision to use U.S. players made the team immediately popular in Philadelphia. Miller was also personable became media darling. Besides creating a team popular with the fans, Miller also created a talented team which ran to a 9-2-8 record and a spot in the playoffs. In the semifinals, the Atoms crushed the Toronto Metros 3-0, then easily handled the Dallas Tornado 2-0, to take the 1973 NASL title. (Miller was named NASL Coach of the Year, the only US-born manager to win that award in the league's 17-year history.) Miller continued his contributions to U.S. soccer when he brought Francisco Marcos into the Atoms. Marcos had played at Hartwick when Miller coached there and Miller now gave Marcos his first taste in soccer management, a skill he would develop over years in the NASL, then as the founder of the United Soccer Leagues. In 1974, McCloskey promoted Miller to general manager, a position he held in addition to his coaching duties. In 1975, he drafted Chris Bahr who became the 1975 NASL Rookie of the Year and later became a standout National Football League placekicker. Miller was unable to replicate his 1974 success and the team slowly became a drain on McCloskey's finances. In 1975, he sold the team to a Mexican group. With the change in ownership, Miller elected to move to the Dallas Tornado. He spent the 1976 through 1980 season with the Tornado, gaining the playoff semifinals in 1980. After Dallas lost that semifinal match with the New York Cosmos, Miller announced his resignation as coach in the locker room. While with Dallas, Miller had a hand in giving another significant individual his start when he drafted Glenn Myernick with the first pick of the 1976 College Draft. He then moved to the Calgary Boomers, taking them into the playoffs in 1981. The Boomers folded at the end of the season and Miller found himself without a team until hired by the Tampa Bay Rowdies during the 1982 season. During the winter he guided the Rowdies to their third indoor title in 1983. In doing so he joined Eddie Firmani and Ron Newman as the only coaches to win NASL titles in both the outdoor league and the indoor variant. His indoor success with the Rowdies did not translate outdoors however, as the team finished 7-23. He resigned on October 5, 1983, after disagreements with the team's management. National team When Dettmar Cramer, the first-ever full-time head coach of the U.S. national team, quit in 1975, he was replaced by Miller on an interim basis. Miller's tenure was brief, only two matches: in a home-and-home series of friendlies against Poland, the US was crushed 7-0 in Poznan and 4-0 in Seattle. Manfred Schellscheidt, one of Miller's players on the Atoms, took over the job that summer. General Manager After leaving the Tampa Bay Rowdies, Miller never again coached a professional team. Instead he entered team management with the Cleveland Force of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). He oversaw the Force from 1984 until it folded at the end of the 1987-1988 season. He then moved on to become the general manager of the United States Soccer Federation for a year. On February 22, 1989, Cleveland was awarded a new MISL franchise, the Cleveland Crunch. The Crunch hired Miller as its general manager, a position he held for the next ten years. In July 1992, the MISL folded and the Crunch moved to the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL). In Miller's ten years, the Crunch won three championships (1994 over St. Louis; 1996 over Kansas City; 1999 over Milwaukee) and lost another three title series (1991 to San Diego; 1993 and 1997, both to Kansas City). Media ESPN later signed Miller as a color commentator on ESPN's Mundial Sports. He also has narrated a series of films on soccer and wrote a chapter in the book Winning Soccer. East Stroudsburg State College inducted Miller into its Athletic Hall of Fame in 1987. Hartwick college inducted Miller into its Hall of Fame in 1995. That same year, Miller was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame. In 2008, Miller was inducted into the New Paltz Hall of Fame along with the 1965 Men's championship soccer team. Miller made news headlines again in 2012 at the age of 75, when he survived an alligator attack while playing golf with two friends at the Lake Ashton Golf Course in Lake Wales, Florida.

College career After graduating from Miami Norland High School, Barnes played college football at Florida International University in Miami, Florida where he was a 2006 All-Sun Belt Conference selection and the school's all-time sacks leader with 21.5. On April 29, 2007, he became the first player in FIU history to be drafted by a National Football League team when he was selected in the fourth round with the 134th overall pick by the Baltimore Ravens. Professional career Baltimore Ravens At the 2007 NFL Scouting Combine, Barnes ran a 4.43 second 40 yard dash, and put up 31 reps on the bench press. Barnes was a promising rookie in 2007, notching 2 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 10 solo tackles. During a 2007 preseason game, Barnes delivered a blind side hit on Philadelphia Eagles punter Saverio Rocca, knocking off his helmet. Even though officials did not penalize Barnes during the game, the league fined him $12,500 for the hit. In 2008, on a roster deep with linebackers, he made a name for himself as a stand out special teams player, also making his first post-season appearance. In 2009, Barnes started the year with his first career interception (against the San Diego Chargers, his future team), but then saw no action for several games. The team finally started using him late in the season, after the defense suffering an overall lack of pass rush, and he came in and notched 3 sacks and 10 solo tackles, as well as a force fumble.

Sherry enjoyed his greatest moments as an amateur, winning The Amateur Championship, being a member of the victorious Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, and appearing in The Open Championship and the Masters Tournament. Career Amateur In 1994 Sherry finished as runner up in The Amateur Championship and played in the Eisenhower Trophy, where the Great Britain team finished as runners up. The following year, he won The Amateur Championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, and finished fourth overall in the Scottish Open, behind only Wayne Riley, Nick Faldo and Colin Montgomerie. His win in the Amateur Championship gave Sherry the opportunity to play in both the Open Championship and the Masters Tournament, two of golf major championships. He gained significant attention during his participation in the 1995 Open which was played at St Andrews, starting when he made a hole in one during a practice round playing alongside Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson. Although he finished behind Steve Webster in the race for the Silver Medal as the lowest scoring amateur, he collected ¬£1 from fellow amateur Tiger Woods, with whom he had a friendly wager over who would achieve the highest-placed finish. Sherry faced Woods again later that year as a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team. He again came out on top as Great Britain and Ireland recorded only their fourth win in the competition. Professional After appearing in the Masters in April 1996, Sherry turned professional. Despite several visits to qualifying school he never won his European Tour card. As a result, he had to rely mostly on sponsors' invitations to compete. He never managed to win a tour event although he did win the Mauritius Open in 1997. Sherry last attempted to qualify for the European Tour in 2002. After a four- year break from competition, he started playing on the Scottish Tartan Tour in 2009 and now splits his time between tournaments on the Tartan Tour and coaching. He has also been involved with Prodream USA, a consultancy assisting British golfers to obtain scholarships to American universities, run by fellow ex-Walker Cup golfer Lorne Kelly.

It was proclaimed on 8 March 1918, in the German-occupied Courland Governorate by a Landesrat composed of Baltic Germans, who offered the crown of the once-autonomous Duchy to Kaiser Wilhelm II, despite the existence of a formerly sovereign reigning family in that duchy, the Biron descendants of Ernst Johann von Biron. Although the German Reichstag supported national self- determination for the Baltic peoples, the German High Command continued the policy of attaching the Baltic to the Reich by relying on Baltic Germans.Kevin O'Connor, The History of the Baltic States, page 78, . In October 1918, the Chancellor of Germany, Prince Maximilian of Baden, proposed to have the military administration in the Baltic replaced by civilian authority. After the German Revolution on 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed independence and on 7 December, the German military handed over authority to the Latvian national government headed by KƒÅrlis Ulmanis.John Hiden, The Baltic States and Weimar Ostpolitik  Historical background  During World War I, the German Army had occupied the Courland Governorate of the Russian Empire by the autumn of 1915. A front was established along a line stretched between Riga, Daugavpils and Baranovitch. The Latvian Provisional National Council was proclaimed on 16 November 1917. On 30 November, the Latvian Provisional National Council proclaimed an autonomous Latvian province within ethnographic boundaries, and a formal, independent Latvian republic was declared on 15 January 1918. After the Russian Revolution, German troops started advancing from Courland, and by the end of February 1918 the territories of the former Russian Governorate of Livonia and Autonomous Governorate of Estonia that had declared independence were also occupied and fell under the German military administration. With the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918 Bolshevist Russia accepted the loss of the Courland Governorate and by agreements concluded in Berlin on 27 August 1918 the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia and the Governorate of Livonia were severed from Russia. As a parallel political movement under the German military administration, Baltic Germans began a process of forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was proclaimed on 8 March 1918 by one such Landesrat composed of Baltic Germans, who offered the crown of the Duchy to Kaiser Wilhelm II. In October 1918, the Chancellor of Germany Prince Maximilian of Baden proposed to have the military administration in the Baltic replaced by civilian authority. The new policy was stated in a telegram from the German Foreign Office to the military administration of the Baltic: The government of the Reich is unanimous in respect of the fundamental change in our policy towards the Baltic countries, namely that in the first instance policy is to be made with the Baltic peoples. On 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed its independence. On 7 December 1918, the German Military handed over authority to the Latvian national government headed by KƒÅrlis Ulmanis.  Recognition  Kaiser Wilhelm recognised the creation of Courland, as a German vassal by writing to Courland's Landesrat on March 8, 1918 (in German): :Wir Wilhelm, von Gottes Gnaden Deutscher Kaiser, K√∂nig von Preu√üen etc. beauftragen hiermit Unseren Reichskanzler, den Grafen von Hertling, dem Kurl√§ndischen Landesrat zu erkl√§ren, da√ü Wir auf den Uns durch seine Vertreter √ºbermittelten Wunsch und auf den Bericht Unseres Reichskanzlers im Namen des Deutschen Reiches das Herzogtum Kurland als freies und selbst√§ndiges Staatswesen anerkennen und bereit sind, im Namen des Deutschen Reiches diejenigen Staatsvertr√§ge mit Kurland abzuschlie√üen, die eine enge wirtschaftliche und milit√§rische Verbindung beider L√§nder gew√§hrleisten.

At the same time, we command Our Chancellor to prepare for the negotiation of these treaties. Our Majesty has commanded that this order be documented, and affixed with Our Imperial Seal.'' ::Given at [unknown], the 15th of March 1918'' ::[signed] Wilhelm'' ::Count von Hertling.''  Disestablishment  The Duchy of Courland was absorbed on September 22, 1918, by the United Baltic Duchy. Neither state, however, had any recognition other than by the German Empire. The United Baltic Duchy was nominally recognized as a sovereign state by the Kaiser only on September 22, 1918, half a year after Soviet Russia had formally relinquished all authority over its former Imperial Baltic provinces to the German Empire in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. After World War I, Courland became a part of the newly formed nation of Latvia, November 18, 1918.

As Booth asks for a list of students from the headmaster of the school, Brennan calls to tell him of the cochlear implant she found in the victim's ear. She informs him that they will be able to identify the victim by tracing the serial number on the device. The victim is Nestor Olivos, a student of the school and the only son of the Venezuelan ambassador. The team finds it odd that Nestor's hyoid bone is broken, as the hyoid of an adolescent should be flexible and almost unbreakable. While the school's headmaster and its head of security are adamant that Nestor had committed suicide, Nestor's mother, the Venezuelan ambassador, urges Dr. Brennan to find the truth and believes that Nestor had been murdered. The central mystery of the case is whether Nestor killed himself or was murdered. Based on the Tabinid maggots' pupal casing, Hodgins determines that Nestor ingested a heavy dose of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, before he died. However, the team cannot be certain if the boy had taken the drug involuntarily but Dr. Brennan is able to give a scenario of Nestor's death involving the ketamine. Combined with the ketamine, the choking would have caused Nestor to regurgitate stomach acids, which would have been trapped in the throat and weakened the hyoid bone. The weight of Nestor's body could then break his hyoid. In addition to the forensic evidence, Dr. Brennan and Agent Booth find DVD recordings of sexual activities, which they discover had led to blackmail. Nestor's classmates Tucker Pattison and Camden Destry had set up a video camera facing Nestor's bed. After Tucker used a video recording to blackmail Camden's mother, he and Camden decided to blackmail Nestor as well. When Tucker and Camden learned that Nestor was going to tell the headmaster of their blackmail attempt, they drugged Nestor and hung him on a tree in order to feign a suicide. In the end, Dr. Brennan and Agent Booth were able to prove that Nestor was murdered. After the case, Booth is given his own access pass to the lab courtesy of Brennan.

It should not be confused with the 1970s German band of the same name. Sand was originally an offshoot of Tim Wright's Germ project, and members of the band are also involved in the band Scorn. Sand performed live for the first time at The Spotted Cow in York in June 1995 with drummer Ben Clark. Their early work was dominated by a jazz aesthetic but as a relationship developed with Soul Jazz Records' owner Stuart Baker the sound became more focused and guitar oriented, whilst maintaining an improvisatory approach to recording and performing. This led to three albums on the Soul Jazz label. They are: Beautiful People Are Evil (1999), Still Born Alive (2001), and The Dalston Shroud (2006) as well as 12\\" vinyl EPs.

It was licensed to Centuri who released it in arcades as Eagle. Incentive Software published ports of Moon Cresta for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Dragon 32, and ZX Spectrum. Gameplay In-game screenshot The player begins the game with a small spaceship armed with a single laser cannon. After successfully completing the first four waves of alien attacks, the player must attempt to dock his ship with the next 'stage' of the ship. This second stage has two lasers in addition to the original one. Each docked stage is one of the player's \\"lives.\\" After successfully clearing two more waves of aliens, the player must again dock with the third and final piece of the ship which also has two more lasers (giving the player 5 lasers in total). The trade-off for this is that the entire ship is a much larger target. Failure to correctly align the stages during either docking sequence causes the destruction of the stage being docked with. After completing the first eight waves the player's ship reverts to the first stage and the process is repeated. If any of the player's three ships are lost along the way, the docking sequence occurs only after the first four waves have been completed. Play ends when all three of the player's ship-stages are destroyed. Reception Moon Cresta was a success for Nichibutsu. It helped propel them into the video game business, and is one of their most successful arcade games. Computer + Video Games commented on the game's visuals for being bright and colorful, and its gameplay for being captivating. Game Machine felt the same way, recognizing it as a sure-hit for arcades because of its gameplay and mechanics. The ZX Spectrum version in particular was met with average reviews. Your Spectrum said that the gameplay was close to the arcade original, but felt that it was beginning to show its age. Sinclair User had a similar response, and commented that the only reason to even play it was to win a contest held by Incentive. They said that the game was a good conversion of the original, but the gameplay itself was dated and not as fun as other games for the system. Crash magazine was a lot more positive towards the game, awarding it a \\"Crash Smash\\" award; they applauded it for its simplistic gameplay, accurate portrayal of the arcade game, and its overall addictiveness, saying: \\"At a time when the emphasis tends to be on complicated arcade/adventures or third generation platform games, I think it‚Äôs brave of Incentive to release an old fashioned shoot em up like this, and I‚Äôm thankful that they have. Great fun!\\" In 1998, Allgame said that while Moon Cresta had several unique ideas, particularly the ship docking mechanic \\"slick\\" controls, and its fast-paced action, it was ultimately hampered by its high difficulty level. They said that the tough gameplay would put off a lot of players, saying: \\"Slick controls, distinctive graphics and almost-musical sound effects add up to a memorable package, but one which was too tough for some casual gamers to master.\\" By contrast in 2007, Eurogamer greatly praised the game for its addictive nature, creativity, and overall challenge that helped set the standard for games to follow. They said: \\"I still, to this very day, admire Moon Cresta for being an adrenalin- fuelled, no nonsense shmup that epitomises the simplistic gaming challenges of early arcade games. Left, right and fire was all it took to take a young impressionable teenager from a world where potting the black was the challenge of the day.\\" In a 2016 retrospective review, Hardcore Gaming 101 labeled Moon Cresta as being an influential and well-regarded shooter from the era. They greatly praised the game's key differences from games like Galaxian and Galaga, such as the ship docking mechanic. Hardcore Gaming 101 felt mixed towards the Super Famicom and PlayStation conversions, disliking both version's modifications to the enemy speed and other characteristics in the game, which they said might put off fans of the original. Retro Gamer felt the same way about the arcade original, saying that Moon Cresta had several differences that made it stand out from Galaxian and Galaga, and that it was an entertaining and important game in its own right. They praised the game's large layer of strategy and scoring, alongside the ship docking mechanic. Retro Gamer concluded their review by writing: \\"By predating Galagas multiple ship mechanic and introducing a range of diverse enemies, Moon Cresta is rightfully regarded as a key stage in the development of arcade shooters. Legacy Moon Cresta spawned a long series of sequels, spin-offs and alterations for dozens of other platforms. The first of these was Eagle, produced by North American game distributor Centuri, which changes most of the visuals and adds a new eagle-shaped enemy. Gremlin Industries followed it with Super Moon Cresta, a modification kit that allows the enemies to fire back at the level and changes some of the text. Nichibutsu itself created Moon Quasar, a spin-off that gives the second ship more firepower and a brief \\"refueling\\" segment, where the player must dock their vessel into a mothership towards the center of the screen. A true sequel to Moon Cresta was released in 1985, titled Terra Cresta. It features radically different gameplay from its predecessors, being a vertical-scrolling game where players must collect different ship pieces that each provide a new weapon, which can also be separated to use a secondary weapon. Another spin-off game, UFO Robo Dangar, was released in 1986 that was similar to Terra Cresta, only the player controls a giant mecha instead of a starship. In 1987, Nichibutsu released Terra Force, which adds horizontal-scrolling segments alongside the vertical- scrolling ones from Terra Cresta. A direct sequel to Terra Cresta, titled Terra Cresta II: Mandler no Gyakushu, was released in 1992 for the PC Engine in Japan, adding new stage designs, additional bosses, and more weapons and power-ups to use. A 3D follow-up, Terra Cresta 3D, was released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn, being one of Nichibutu's final games; it serves as a 3D update to Terra Cresta, with new stages and weapon types.

H. Richardson. It is located at 53 Main Street, Easton, Massachusetts, immediately adjacent to another Richardson building, Oakes Ames Memorial Hall. In 2016 the Ames Free Library won the Best Small Library in America award from the Library Journal. This award was created in 2005 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to encourage and showcase outstanding libraries serving populations of fewer than 25,000. This marks the second time the library has won this award. History On the death of Oliver Ames, Jr., he left $50,000 for the construction of a library. The will stipulated that it was to be a private institution, not owned by the town, but operated in trust for the public. The request was carried out by Ames' children, Frederick Lothrop Ames and Helen Angier Ames. They hired Henry Hobson Richardson to design the building. The final cost of the building came to at least $80,000. The library was built from 1877 to 1879, although it did not open until March 10, 1883. It is generally rectangular, with broad gable projecting from its north end and a rectangular tower rising where the gable meets the main mass. The gable's front facade contains a heavily arched entry on the first floor and a row of five arched windows separated by pairs of short columns above. The facade is light-brown Milford granite laid in random ashlar with reddish-brown Longmeadow brownstone trim. Its roof is red-orange tile. A children's wing (red brick) was added in 1931, eliminating the original lavatory and document room. Within, the library's major rooms, stack wing, hall, and reading room are laid out longitudinally. The reading room's fireplace is primarily by Stanford White, and the stone and bronze medallions of Oliver Ames, Jr. were designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. See also * H. H.

The Marist School is a Catholic school but welcomes all Christians and other faiths who are in sympathy with the schools' ethos. Once girls reach 11 they often join Senior and Sixth Form until age 18 years. In Preparatory, there are two phases: Early Years and Preparatory. History The school, as it is today, was founded as a result of the London bombings during World War II. The Marist Sisters had founded a convent and boarding school in Richmond, London (then in the county of Surrey) in 1870. During the air raids of 1940, although there were no casualties, the convent did suffer irreparable damage, forcing the sisters to seek another place. They temporarily relocated to East Sheen before purchasing Frognal Estate in 1947 where the school has been located ever since. The school continued to expand with a new building for the Prep department opened in 1970. Boarding was eventually abolished.A Short History The school is predominantly run by lay staff but the sisters have a representative in the Board of Governors. Campus The school is situated within of woodland in the village of Sunninghill, Berkshire. The site includes the Senior and Sixth Form Phase, the Nursery and Preparatory Phase, a science block, drama studio, an indoor swimming pool, a music block, large playing fields, netball courts, an AstroTurf pitch and a multi-purpose Sports Hall, officially opened in March 2017 by the Duke of York.

Case & Sons Cutlery Company is an American manufacturer of traditional pocket knives, fixed blades/sporting knives, kitchen knives, limited edition commemoratives and collectibles. The company originated in Little Valley, New York, around the turn of the 20th century, before relocating to its current home, Bradford, Pennsylvania, in 1905. The company's namesake, William Russell Case, first made knives with his brothers under the name Case Brothers Cutlery Company. His son, John Russell (\\"Russ\\") Case, worked as a salesman for his father's company before founding W.R. Case & Sons. History The company's roots extend back to 1889, when the Case brothers ‚Äì William Russell (W.R.), Jean, John and Andrew Case, formerly of the Cattaraugus Cutlery Company ‚Äì began selling cutlery from the back of a wagon in various small western New York villages. In January 1900, the brothers incorporated to form Case Brothers Cutlery Company. John Russell Case, who named the company after his father, William Russell (\\"W.R.\\"), formed W.R. Case & Sons as it is known today. By the time the company moved to Pennsylvania in 1905, the four Case brothers had established their brands. The company's original factory in Little Valley, New York, burned down in 1912. Beginning with World War I, Case has made military knives for U.S. servicemen and women including the M3 Fighting Knife and the V-42 Stiletto (the latter, for the Devil's Brigade). During the 1965 flight of the Molly Brown, astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young used special Case knives on a NASA space mission. The company, alongside Alcoa, founded the Cutco brand of cutlery in 1949 under the company name Alcas (its name being an amalgamation of Alcoa and Case); Alcoa would purchase Case's stake in the company in 1972, and Alcas' management bought the company from Alcoa in 1982, and is now simply known as the Cutco Corporation. The Case Company is currently owned by Zippo Manufacturing Company, another business based in Bradford. Case knives are made with blades usually stamped from domestic chromium-vanadium steel alloy or stainless steel, and hardened using proprietary heat treatment methods. Knife handles or covers are made of a variety of materials, from the more common synthetic materials to natural materials like Brazilian cattle bone, India stag, buffalo horn, ancient mammoth ivory, mother of pearl, exotic hardwoods and precious stones on the more expensive collector's knives. Brass, nickel, and silver metals are used to make the knives' other component parts. Many people collect Case knives as a hobby. This practice arose from the unique tang stamp dating systems employed by the company beginning in the late 19th century. Today's Case Collectors Club is made up of 18,000 members. Case knife patterns The list of Case knife patterns has remained fairly consistent throughout its history, although a number of new Case designs have been patented in recent years. Some of these include: The SlimLock, Trapper, Tiny Trapper, Baby Doc, Tribal-Lock, CopperLock, RussLock, Baby Butterbean, Cheetah, Cheetah Cub, Hobo, Sod Buster, Mako, Mini-Blackhorn and XX-Changer. The Hobo When the Hobo (54HB) is closed, it resembles a regular Trapper. The handle splits apart revealing a separate knife, fork, spoon and bottle opener. Case produced two variations of the Hobo ('51 and '52) from the early 1900s-1940. These were made with two to four utensil implements using a can opener, soup spoon, three-pronged fork, and knife blade. Case re-introduced the Hobo (54) in 1983. The CopperLock In 1997, Case introduced the CopperLock. Designed by Tom Hart, the CopperLock (549L) combined elements from older Case knife patterns to make an entirely new knife with a fully locking blade. Case celebrated the 10th Anniversary of the CopperLock in 2007. This pattern was retired to the Case XX Vault in July 2008. The SlimLock The SlimLock was originally produced in 2005 as a tribute to John Russell Case. Each knife carries a \\"JRC\\" (John Russell Case) tang stamp and a liner that locks. The first featured BG-42 steel blades. A second family was released in 2006 that featured ladder patterned Damascus blades. The Cheetah The Cheetah is a single-bladed knife that has a swing guard. Throughout its existence, it has been manufactured with or without a swing guard, and with and without a locking mechanism. Some of the more recent knives are stamped with an \\"L\\" after the pattern number, which signifies that the blade locks when opened. The RussLock The RussLock (953L) debuted in 2000. This pattern features a liner lock and a gimped lever for convenient one-hand opening. The RussLock was inspired by the Jack Knife (028), a pattern that has been retired for over 40 years. It was designed by the late Case master knifemaker Tommy Hart, who named it after William Russell (Russ) Case. The pattern number (1953) represents the year Russ Case died. Case licensed knives Case has regularly manufactured knives under licenses with American icons like Elvis Presley Enterprises, Ford Motor Company, Coca-Cola Company, Boy Scouts of America, Ducks Unlimited, John Deere, Sturm, Ruger & Co., National Wild Turkey Federation, John Wayne, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Johnny Cash and Brooks & Dunn. Case has also partnered with custom knifemaker Tony Bose to produce new designs. Steel types Chrome vanadium (CV) Chrome vanadium is a special formula of alloyed cutlery steel known for its ease of re-sharpening. (CV blades require extra care. A thin film of oil should be kept on the blade to maintain the polished finish of the steel.) Case Tru-Sharp Surgical Stainless Steel (SS) Case Tru-Sharp Surgical Stainless Steel is a high-carbon steel. It offers excellent blade strength and corrosion resistance. Damascus (DAM) Damascus steels date back to the Crusades, and are named for the famous Syrian city where some of the first man-made metals were traded publicly. It consists of many thin layers of metal that are forged together to form a laminated solid. Designs take shape as layers are folded in then welded together by forging; while creating an intricate design and strong blade. BG42 (BG42) BG42 is a domestic alloy steel. It is an aeronautics bearing-grade composition with added carbon and vanadium. 154CM 154-CM is an American-made stainless alloy. It combines three principal elements: carbon, chromium, and molybdenum. Added levels of carbon and chromium are also used. Re-sharpening can require extra effort, but is needed less often. Awards W.R. Case & Sons has been the recipient of awards in the cutlery industry over the years. In 2004 Case was awarded the Industry Achievement Award at the Blade Show held in Atlanta, GA; the Case Family Brands Encyclopedia Set was awarded the Blade Magazine Investor Collector Knife of the Year at the same show. The Case SlimLock won an Editor's Choice Award from Popular Mechanics Magazine. In 2008 Case won \\"Collaboration Knife of the Year\\" at Blade Magazine's Blade Show in Atlanta, GA with a Tony Bose designed piece named the \\"Arkansas Hunter\\". Case has also won awards for advertising and marketing, for instance its packaging designs won in two categories at the North American Packaging Competition for Excellence: Best Family Packages and General Superiority According to End-Use Household. The Case website won an ADDY award for creative excellence in 2006. A Case packaging design won the Best of the Show Award at the North American Packaging Competition for Excellence in the Collector's Item category. Case Collectors Club In 1972, Dewey Ferguson, a Case knife collector and author, wrote to Case President Bob Farquharson about forming a knife collectors association for the W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Company. The Case Collectors Club (CCC) was established in 1981. A newsletter was introduced in March of that year to formalize communications between Case and its club members. The first edition of the newsletter was in black and white and had eight pages. During the same year, the first Case Collectors Club Annual Club Knife, an Appaloosa Bone Large Trapper (A6151 SSP), was made available to club members. The club began with 426 charter members in 1981. Today, there are nearly 18,000 members. Ferguson was listed on Case's \\"Wall of Fame\\" in 2001.

Some 64 years later, on 1 December 2006, the last independent RAEME Workshop was disbanded. RAEME soldiers continue in their role to provide support through attachment to other units in Tech Support Troops, Sections or Platoons. The Role of RAEME Artificer Artificer Sergeant Major (ASM) is an appointment held by a Warrant Officer Class 1 or 2 in RAEME (Depending on the size of the unit) whose function is the senior soldier/tradesmen for the repair and recovery of all mechanical and electrical equipment.

In June 2001, the web-site consultant Joe Tucker joined, eventually assuming full ownership of RateBeer. In August 2006, RateBeer's annual press-release of the highest rated beers on the site caused concern when various world media reported that supplies of Westvleteren 12 were sold out due to being listed as the \\"Best beer in the world\\" on the site.Leanne Logan, Geert Cole, RateBeer has over 4.5 million ratings (as of early 2013) of more than 470,000 beers, from over 26,000 breweries. In June 2017, it was revealed that Anheuser-Busch InBev had acquired a minority stake in RateBeer via the incubator ZX Ventures. This purchase led to concerns that the company had a conflict of interest, citing that the site could present bias towards Anheuser-Busch InBev brands, that there was a lack of transparency over the role of the company's investment, and that it could potentially gain access to customer data. Several breweries attempted to demand that their listings be removed from the website. Executive director Joe Tucker stated that \\"Nothing about this investment changes who we are and what we provide.

The cavaleiros and the forcados are unique to the Portuguese variety of bullfighting, as well as the participation of horsewomen (cavaleiras) in the routines. Main figures * Cavaleiros - A horseman or woman (rider), dressed in traditional 17th century costumes fights the bull from horseback. The horses are Lusitanos, specially trained for the fights. These horses are usually skilled in dressage and may exhibit their art in the arena. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four bandarilhas (small spears) in the back of the bull. In the past, horseback bullfighters were often members of old aristocratic families. The horsewomen (cavaleiras) are a pioneer and unique feature of the Portuguese bullfighting. Ana Batista, S√≥nia Matias, Ana Rita and Joana Andrade are among the first and most renowned cavaleiras of Portugal. * Forcados - The forcados are a group of eight men who challenge the bull directly, without any protection or weapon of defense. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a pega de cara or pega de caras (face catch). The front man secures the animal's head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued. Forcados were usually people from lower classes who, to this day, practice their art through amateur associations. * Matadores - Same as the Spanish matadores, but they do not kill the bull in the end. * Bandarilheiros - These men are the matador's and/or cavaleiro's helpers in the arena. They are skillful and wear the suit of light as the matador, except not with the gold sequins. While in the arena, they are holding the gold/pink cape to distract or position the bull. Stages  Corridas de touros  Most Portuguese bullfights (corridas de touros) are held in two phases: the spectacle of the cavaleiro, followed by the pega. In Portugal, the main stars of bullfighting are the cavaleiros, as opposed to Spain, where the matadores are the most prominent bullfighters. Nevertheless, bullfights with matadores are frequent, notably with Portuguese matadores who practice their trade in Spain and who, when in Portugal, replace the sword in their final strike with a bandarilha, a small type of spear. Examples of famous Portuguese matadores are V√≠tor Mendes and Pedrito de Portugal. The spectacle starts with the cavaleiro, a horseman on a Lusitano specially trained for the fights, fighting the bull from horseback. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four bandeirilhas in the back of the bull. Pega de caras In the second stage, called the pega, the forcados, a group of eight men, challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defense. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a pega de cara or pega de caras (face catch). The front man secures the animal's head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued. Many people who watch Portuguese-style bullfights in the United States use the term, \\"suicide squad\\", to refer to this group of eight men. The bull is not killed, at the end of the corrida, leading oxen are let into the arena and two campinos on foot herd the bull along them back to its pen. After the fight the bull may be either killed by a professional butcher or, after a good performance, restored to health and released to pasture for breeding. Nevertheless, tradition was so strong at the small frontier town of Barrancos, where the bull was illegally killed, that the government was forced to relent and permit the town to follow its ancient matador tradition and kill the bull.  Tourada √† corda  There are other forms of traditional bullfighting in Portugal, some differing markedly from the version described above. In the Azores, bullfighting is often reminiscent of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, in the respect that those most at risk are human beings, not the bulls themselves. The Azorean style involves a group of people vying in a tug-of-war with a young bull by holding fast to a long stout rope tied around the bull's neck. This is called the tourada √† corda (bull-on-a-rope 'game'). Portuguese immigrants from the Azores also practice \\"tourada a corda\\" in the city of Brampton, southern Ontario, Canada. Hazards In Portugal, some bulls have their horns severed and covered in a way that they do not present sharp points. This practice is believed to have been introduced by King Joseph I of Portugal after a tragic event in a bullfight over which he was presiding at Salvaterra de Magos. The son and heir of the 4th Marquis of Marialva was fighting a bull on horseback when the animal wounded his horse. The young man fell, was kicked by the bull and killed. The Marquis himself, then around 70 years of age, jumped from the royal cabin that he shared with the king, drew his sword and killed the animal.  Legal status   Regional variation  thumb Some southern and central regions of Portugal, such as Ribatejo and parts of the Alentejo, as well as Terceira Island in the Azores, are traditionally more interested in the corrida de touros. In Portugal's northern regions, bullfighting has a much lower presence, except for P√≥voa de Varzim where bullfighting arenas are known to exist, at various locations, since the 18th century. Some Portuguese municipalities have declared bullfighting immaterial cultural heritage, and become members of the Section of Municipalities with Tauromachic Activities of the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities (ANMP); others have implicitly or explicitly refused to do so.Associa√ß√£o Nacional dos Munic√≠pios Portugueses (ANMP) (2014). RTP has historically shown bullfights in prime- time; the practice has been criticized, with left-wing parties proposing legislation to prevent bullfighting being shown on the public broadcasting network or changing the rating of the show to an adults-only classification. Attempts at prohibition Queen Maria II of Portugal prohibited bullfighting in 1836 with the argument that it was unbefitting for a civilised nation. The ban was lifted in 1921, but in 1928 a law was passed that forbade the killing of the bull during a fight. In practice, bulls still frequently die after a fight from their injuries or by being slaughtered by a butcher. In 2001, matador Pedrito de Portugal controversially killed a bull at the end of a fight after spectators encouraged him to do so by chanting \\"Kill the bull! Kill the bull!\\" The crowds gave Pedrito a standing ovation, hoisted him on their shoulders and paraded him through the streets. Hours later the police arrested him and charged him with a fine, but they released him after crowds of angry fans surrounded the police station. A long court case ensued, finally resulting in Pedrito's conviction in 2007 with a fine of ‚Ç¨100,000. In 2002, the Portuguese government gave Barrancos, a town near the Spanish border where bullfighting fans stubbornly persisted in encouraging the killing of bulls during fights, a dispensation from the 1928 ban. In 2014, the same dispensation was granted to Reguengos de Monsaraz, where a festivity featuring the killing of bulls took place every year despite the ban; the annual event was then recognized as a tradition by a Beja Court, which guaranteed access to the exception. In 2009, the northern city of Viana do Castelo prohibited bullfighting in all instances when a municipality's permit was required. This decision was contested in 2012 by a Braga court and bullfighting was permitted again in the municipality. Despite this court ruling, only 3 bull races were registered in Viana do Castelo between 2012 and the last one in 2014. In June 2018, the P√≥voa de Varzim municipality announced a bullfighting ban starting January 1, 2019; pro-bullfighting groups interceded against this prohibition and in September 2019, a court in Porto ruled that the ban was unconstitutional. The city of P√≥voa de Varzim has approved the demolition of the P√≥voa de Varzim Bullfighting Arena, its municipal bullfighting ring. In July 2018, animalist party PAN presented a proposal at the Portuguese Parliament to abolish all types of bullfighting in the country. Left-wing party Left Bloc voted in favour of the proposal but criticised its lack of solutions to the foreseen consequences of the abolition. The proposal was however categorically rejected by all other parties, that cited freedom of choice and respect for tradition as arguments against it.

In each of these cases, player 1 can ensure that on the next move he hands back to his opponent a heap of size 4 plus heaps of size 2 and smaller: player 2: 7+1 ‚Üí 6+1+1 player 2: 7+1 ‚Üí 5+2+1 player 2: 7+1 ‚Üí 4+3+1 player 1: 6+1+1 ‚Üí 4+2+1+1 player 1: 5+2+1 ‚Üí 4+1+2+1 player 1: 4+3+1 ‚Üí 4+2+1+1 Now player 2 has to split the 4-heap into 3 + 1, and player 1 subsequently splits the 3-heap into 2 + 1: player 2: 4+2+1+1 ‚Üí 3+1+2+1+1 player 1: 3+1+2+1+1 ‚Üí 2+1+1+2+1+1 player 2 has no moves left and loses  Mathematical theory  The game can be analysed using the Sprague‚ÄìGrundy theorem. This requires the heap sizes in the game to be mapped onto equivalent nim heap sizes. This mapping is captured in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as : Heap size : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ... Equivalent Nim heap : 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 4 3 0 ... Using this mapping, the strategy for playing the game Nim can also be used for Grundy's game. Whether the sequence of nim-values of Grundy's game ever becomes periodic is an unsolved problem. Elwyn Berlekamp, John Horton Conway and Richard Guy have conjecturedE. Berlekamp, J. H. Conway, R. Guy. Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982. that the sequence does become periodic eventually, but despite the calculation of the first 235 values by Achim Flammenkamp, the question has not been resolved.

Once again, abstention was very high for this type of election- only 47% of eligible voters voted. The election was also the first French European election to be won by the Socialist Party (PS). In a major surprise and historical upset for the government, Charles Pasqua's and Philippe de Villiers' list uniting Pasqua's new Gaullist Rally for France (RPF) and de Villiers' eurosceptic Movement for France (MPF) list surpassed the list of President Jacques Chirac's RPR-Liberal Democracy, led by Nicolas Sarkozy. The election ended Sarkozy's immediate political future, including a run for the presidency of the Rally for the Republic ‚Äì Mich√®le Alliot-Marie, a close supporter of Chirac, succeeded him. However, the alliance between Pasqua and de Villiers proved to be ephemeral. Indeed, de Villiers broke with Pasqua later 2000 and thus ended the RPF's chance to become a large common party for all eurosceptic Gaullists from within the RPR. The New Union for French Democracy (Nouvelle UDF), led by Fran√ßois Bayrou ran independently of the RPR, contrary to Chirac's wishes, for the first time since 1984. Bayrou won a relatively good result, 9.28%, allowing him to pursue his more independent political strategy (slowly distancing the party from the RPR) within the New UDF. The other winner of the election were The Greens led by Franco-German green politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit, whose list won 9.72%, the party's second- best result after 1989. Minor parties, including the agrarian populist Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Traditions and the far-left Workers' Struggle obtained very good results and elected 6 and 5 MEP's respectively. The far- right FN was penalized by Bruno Megret's dissident MNR list and obtained a low result. The French Communist Party also did poorly.

The current neighborhood was named \\"Myloi\\" before the Ottoman era, but the Byzantine chronographer G. Frantzis referred to it as \\"Mylous\\".

It is located at 19 Wing Comox, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and operates the CP-140 Aurora. History No. 407 Coastal Strike Squadron was formed at RAF Thorney Island, England on 8 May 1941, first training on the Bristol Blenheim. It was one of seven Article XV RCAF units to serve with RAF Coastal Command. The squadron's wartime history can be divided into two periods. From September 1941 to January 1943, the squadron operated as a \\"strike\\" squadron attacking enemy shipping with the Lockheed Hudson. It was as a strike squadron that it won its reputation and its nickname \\"The Demon Squadron\\". On 29 January 1943 it was re-designated 407 General Reconnaissance Squadron, and for the remainder of the war it protected friendly shipping from the U-boat threat operating the Vickers Wellington. The squadron was disbanded on 4 June 1945 following the end of the Second World War. On 1 July 1952 the squadron was reactivated at RCAF Station Comox as 407 Maritime Reconnaissance Squadron flying the Avro Lancaster. On 17 July 1956 it was renamed as a Maritime Patrol Squadron. The squadron has served continuously in Comox since 1952 flying the Lancaster, P2V-7 Neptune, and CP-107 Argus. On 28 June 1975, the squadron was presented its Standard by the Honourable Walter Owen, Q.C. L.L.D. Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. Currently, 407 Squadron flies the updated CP-140 Aurora on coastal patrol, anti-submarine and long range patrol duties. It used these aircraft to conduct operations in the Arabian Sea after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.

She came to prominence in the 1940s and became known as one of the seven great singing stars of the era. She continued to record and perform for many decades until the 2000s. Early years Wu was born in Ningbo to an intellectual family with her father a chemical engineer and mother a gynaecologist. She grew up in Shanghai and enjoyed singing to radio tunes at an early age. She originally wanted to go to the Shanghai Academy of Music, but her parents opposed the idea as they had wanted her to study medicine and criticized her for lacking ambition. When she was 15 or 16, to work around her parents' disapproval, she began singing under a stage name Qian Yin (Èå¢Ëåµ) on the weekends for a Shanghai radio station singing children's songs. She performed in secret and unpaid for a few years. Career Wu had a soft singing voice that made her a success, and a buzz later got around about a new singer, although Wu's father had not realized that it was his own daughter's voice that he heard on the radio. Wu was largely self-taught in her singing, although later she learnt some vocal techniques from a male singer Xu Lang (ÂæêÊúó). At the age of 24, she participated in a singing competition at Ciro's (‰ªôÊ®ÇÊñØ) nightclub performing a song by Bai Hong, and won the crown. She then performed regularly at various dance halls and nightclubs such as Ciro's and the Paramount in Shanghai and garnered acclaim for her performances. In 1946, she became signed to a contract with Path√© Records (China) record company. For her recording career, Wu was given the stage name Yingyin, meaning \\"voice of an oriole\\". Her first record \\"I Want to Forget You\\" (ÊàëÊÉ≥Âøò‰∫Ü‰Ω†), written by Xu Lang, became a hit. Within 3 years of signing, Path√© Records had produced and released over 30 songs with her. In 1955 she joined Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station. She relocated to Hong Kong in 1957 where she continued her singing career as well as recording for Path√© Records. Among her best known songs are \\"Spring returns to the World\\" (Â§ßÂú∞ÂõûÊò•), \\"Heartbreak\\" (Êñ∑ËÖ∏Á¥Ö), \\"I Have This Feeling\\" (ÊàëÊúâ‰∏ÄÊÆµÊÉÖ), \\"The Bright Moon Sends My Love Across a Thousand Miles\\" (ÊòéÊúàÂçÉÈáåÂØÑÁõ∏ÊÄù), \\"Fine Spring Night\\" (Â•ΩÊò•ÂÆµ), \\"Chance Meeting of Strangers\\" (ËêçÊ∞¥Áõ∏ÈÄ¢). She was affectionately nicknamed \\"Queen of the Nasal Voice\\" (ÈºªÈü≥Ê≠åÂêé). Wu enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s and returned to China for recordings in 1983 in Guangzhou. In July 1984, she moved from Hong Kong to Pasadena, California. She performed extensively in Taiwan and Hong Kong in China, Singapore, Malaysia, United States and Canada well into her old age. At the age of 80, she was still singing in overseas Chinese neighborhood community events for charitable causes. On 3 January 2003 she was invited to perform at the Shanghai Grand Theatre. Wu died in Los Angeles on 17 December 2009.

The show is the highest rated regular program on Icelandic television. Generally, the sketches satirize public events of the past week, or the exploits of recurring characters in the show. Spaugstofan's current lineup consists of actors √ñrn √Årnason, Karl √Åg√∫st √ölfsson, P√°lmi Gestsson and Sigur√∞ur Sigurj√≥nsson. Randver √ûorl√°ksson was a part of the original cast but left before the 2007‚Äì2008 season. Before Randver left, the lineup had remained more or less unchanged since the group was formed. Randver's leaving the program proved very controversial in Iceland, especially as he made it clear he was not resigning of his own will, and no reason was publicly given for his departure, other than that it would make room for new guest actors in each episode..

Art by Pol Medina, Jr. 2078 is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series Pugad Baboy, created by Pol Medina, Jr. and originally published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer in 1992. This particular story arc lasts 45 strips long. In 1994, the story arc was reprinted in PB5, the fifth book compilation of the comic strip series. Synopsis The Pugad Baboy gang waits in line at an Line 1 station. Because of their combined weight, their LRT car breaks off the train and runs right into a black hole that is a time warp. The car suddenly stops and the group alights at the same LRT station, which is now in a decrepit condition. A black-suited man calling himself Taxx Vader (a combined spoof of Darth Vader and a tax evader) tells the group that they are in the future - 2078 to be exact. A friend of Taxx Vader's, Chewbaboy (spoofing Chewbacca) then offers to act as the group's tour guide in the Manila of 2078. Among the developments and changes they discover are the following: * The Manila Line 1 ceased operating in the year 2064 * The Ninoy Aquino International Airport had been renamed Tan Yu International Airport. * Bien-Bien Roxas became President in 2028. * Mandarin has replaced Filipino as the national language. * Arabs now use the Philippines as a rest and recreation base before returning to their jobs as contract workers in Japan - oil supplies in the Middle East have been exhausted for years. * The Japanese had bought the entire United States and turned it into a gigantic golf course with the Americans as their caddies. * The US President is an African-American woman. * The heavyweight boxing champion of the world is only nine years old. * Quiapo is now known as the Gilbert-Willie Yu District. * The scarcity of water (a bottle of water costs as much as a bag of blood due to inflation) caused the production of beer to stop. * Medical science has advanced to the point where coin-operated CAT scan machines exist, animal organs can be transplanted into humans, and human cloning can be arranged. * Inflation has driven the Philippine peso to such stratospheric levels that even a simple pair of shoes can cost millions each. * Flyovers dominate the main thoroughfares of Metro Manila. * The Philippines' population is more than 800 million. * The Philippine Daily Inquirer is now sold in microchip format with a comic strip made by PM the Fifth (a reference to strip creator Pol Medina Jr.) Dobermaxx All of a sudden, the sound of gunfire causes the group to scamper for cover. Chewbaboy identifies the culprit as a member of Black Eden, a gang of drug pushers operating in the city. The pusher passes right in front of Polgas, who was assembling his OCB-issue Garapata Gun and kicked the criminal's legs out from under him. The Black Eden gang member tries to shoot back at him with his laser pistol, but a shot from somewhere else ruins his aim but also immolates Polgas' own Garapata Gun. Polgas is surprised to observe that the mysterious shooter also used a Garapata Gun. The newcomer introduces himself as Dobermaxx, the OCB director in 2078. Dobermaxx explains that the captured pusher is named Adam Carlo, and that the drug he was selling was known as \\"Blue Emerald\\", smuggled into the country by grinding the drug crystals into powder and applied as underarm deodorant. Dobermaxx also remarks that Polgas looks familiar; he mentions Agent Polgas by name. Polgas decides to hide his true identity calling himself \\"Jun.\\" The pair get into Dobermaxx's ride, presumably a Porsche variant similar to Polgas' Thunderdog code-named the Bullfox II and proceeded to his office after incarcerating Adam Carlo. They begin to discuss OCB personnel files, equipment and the drug pushers. Dobermaxx explains that the Black Eden gang's mastermind is a shadowy figure named Anton Damien who had three clones as his lieutenants - Adam Alfred, Adam Berto and the prisoner, Adam Carlo. Dobermaxx adds that Agent Polgas' grandson, another OCB agent, was missing and presumed dead when he intentionally crashed the heli-jet he was piloting in order to kill Adam Berto. Just then, Dobermaxx receives a transmission that the cell block in which Adam Carlo is being kept is under attack - an escape attempt is being made. He attaches a jet pack to his Dingo Suit powered armor and rushes off while Polgas takes the Jet Jackal, the OCB's VTOL craft. Seeing Dobermaxx respond, Adam Carlo goes to the top of the cell block and shoots him down with his laser cannon before Polgas crashes the Jackal on the platform, killing him. Polgas bails out and lands right into a furious Anton Damien, who proceeds to beat him up while wearing his own power suit. In the midst of the struggle, Polgas successfully bites into Anton Damien's power suit and short- circuits the whole system. Without the empowerment of the suit, Polgas moves on to pummel Anton Damien.. Polgas removes the suit's helmet and is stunned to see his 20th-century nemesis Atong Damuho, but who was in reality, Atong Damuho's great-grandson. Both Dobermaxx and Anton Damien wonder at this strange turn of events. Return from 2078 Chewbaboy appears and shouts that the black hole at the Line 1 station is opened once again, allowing Polgas to finally return to his own time. When Polgas insists on seeing Anton Damien sent to jail first, Chewbaboy explains that he has to leave or wait 23 more years for another black hole to open. Anton Damien mocks Polgas' predicament by wagging his tongue. It only infuriates Polgas by getting Dobermaxx's Garapata Gun and shoots several rounds at Anton Damien's face, triggering an unbearable itch. Chewbaboy, Dobermaxx and Polgas run to the Line 1 station and sees the black hole beginning to close. Dobermaxx hotwires an old power cable to his Dingo Suit and throws Polgas into the black hole, but not before Polgas makes him promise to find Agent Polgas' grandson. As Polgas enters the black hole before it closes completely, Dobermaxx removes his helmet and reveals himself to be actually the missing grandson of Agent Polgas, calling him lolo (Filipino - grandfather). Epilogue The Pugad Baboy group finally arrives back in 1992 aboard the same Line 1 car, but now have no memory of their adventures in 2078. They wonder why Polgas lies spread-eagled on the box-car's rear windshield. They also notice that his Garapata Gun looked different and that it now shoots at longer range. The OCB Weapons and Armaments laboratory analyzes the weapon, but could not determine the exact kind of metal used in its construction, but notes its built-in laser sight, a satellite transceiver, and an etching engraved on the trigger housing - \\"Dobermaxx\\". Since his memory of the events of 2078 had been erased, Polgas could only speculate on where the new Garapata Gun came from and decides to adopt \\"Dobermaxx\\" as his new OCB callsign. Cultural references * One of Pol Medina, Jr.'s running gags involves the contention that Chinese businessmen would soon own everything in the country, hence the inclusion of Tan Yu and his family in this story arc. Tan Yu is a very successful if reclusive businessman born of Chinese immigrants from Fujian. He made his first million at only eighteen years of age and is now considered to be one of Asia's richest men with properties in the Philippines, Taiwan, China and the United States. His daughter, Emilia \\"Bien-Bien\\" Roxas, runs Tan Yu's main company, Asia Internationale Group. * Gilbert C. Yu and Willie C. Yu are the founders of G&W; Architects, Engineers, Project Development Consultants, an architectural firm established in 1971 and responsible for the construction of over 1000 buildings. * References to science-fiction films are abound in the 2078 story arc. Aside from the Star Wars Taxx Vader and Chewbaboy spoofs, an Imperial Stormtrooper could barely be seen in one of the panels. RoboCop is also present in another panel. * The fact that 2078 Manila is swarming with flyovers is a stab at the Aquino administration's construction of the Ortigas Interchange during the early 1990s. * Chewbaboy's revelation of Arabs working as contract employees is a \\"reversal\\" of Overseas Filipino Workers often going to jobs in the Middle East and Japan. * In a strip immediately preceding 2078 in PB5, an author's note reveals that the Pugad Baboy gang went to 2078 on the day of the 1992 Philippine presidential elections and came back one week later in real time. Dagul claims to Doc Sebo that they were gone for several weeks. * In the aftermath of the series, the other Pugad Baboy villagers went to buy ropes, after being shocked that Senator Cabalfin won the election as Senator, hinting mass suicide.

If you want a little humour, a little satire, call the hot line.\\" Jack Kapica and Rudy Platiel, \\"Heritage Front hearing ends in muddle Police on horseback clear path through protesters outside courthouse\\", '\\"Globe and Mail, January 26, 1993 His high profile as a proponent of racism in the early 1990s culminated in a June 1993 demonstration outside his house by 175 supporters of Anti- Racist Action in which rocks and paint were thrown at Schipper's residence breaking windows and causing property damage.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Anti-racists vent anger on white supremacist Demonstrators vandalize house while outnumbered police look on\\", Globe and Mail, June 12, 1993 The demonstration assembled in a downtown park and was expected by white supremacists to be heading to the house of Ernst Z√ºndel who had gathered at the Carlton Street property and were surprised to learn later of the protest's true destination.Gail Swainson and Jim Wilkes, \\"Anti-racist mob trashes home\\", Toronto Star, June 12, 1993 Heritage Front leader Wolfgang Droege was \\"enraged\\" by the attack and reportedly vowed revenge saying \\"From now on, if that's the way they want to play the game, that's fine.\\" That evening, approximately 30 to 40 Heritage Front members attacked Anti-Racist Action supporters at Sneaky Dee's bar, a popular hang-out for anti-racists. According to a bar employee, the white supremacists \\"stomped all over people\\" and \\"They just went crazy. They wanted to kill anybody. There were riot cops everywhere and a lot of glass flying around.

In June 1994, Schipper was sentenced for two months imprisonment (Droege and Kenneth Barker were also sentenced) for contempt of court for disregarding a court order to cease the telephone hate messages.Jim Wilkes, \\"Heritage Front leader, 2 members jailed\\", Toronto Star, June 23, 1994 Also, in 1994, the five anti-racists charged for attacking Schipper's house were acquitted.Wendy Darroch, \\"Anti-racist protesters acquitted of mischief Marchers trashed white supremacist leader's house\\", Toronto Star, September 15, 1994 Schipper claimed to have developed his racist and anti-Semitic views as a result of having been adopted by a Jewish family as a child. \\"I was adopted by a Jewish family who couldn't have their own children when I was a month and a half old,\\" he said. \\"I never got along with them at all. I didn't look Jewish. I didn't act Jewish.\\"Kirk Makin, \\"Scenes from the far right Students, jobless, and the obsessed adopt racist creed\\", Globe and Mail, February 8, 1993 \\"We disagreed on absolutely everything. Races think differently, you know. They finally threw me out when I was sixteen.\\" He bummed around North America, playing guitar in bar bands and working as a telemarketer. Finally, Schipper found his calling after contacting the Heritage Front. \\"We whites are the doormat at the house of equality\\", he said. \\"I want to be politically incorrect and stir things up.\\" In 2015, Schipper using the pseudonym Johnny Jensen (or J.

The estate is located in what is now called Gamlebyen (old town) in Oslo, Norway. Various remnants of the medieval bishop's original palace are still visible. History The construction was begun around 1210 by the then bishop, Nikolas Arnesson, continuing through to the early 14th century. The palace built in stone replaced a previous bishop's residence built in wood, established in the 12th century. The main buildings were surrounded by tall walls, and from a tower, a wooden bridge connected the palace to the neighboring Hallvards Cathedral. The palace was built like a fortified castle. Together with the cathedral, the palace was not only a religious centre in Middle Age Oslo, it was also of significant political importance. The first agreement of union between Norway and Sweden was signed in the bishop's palace just after the death of H√•kon V of Norway, in 1319. The palace was damaged after Swedish attacks in 1523, and after the reformation in 1537 large parts of the palace were torn down. In 1554 the Protestant bishop moved to the current bishop's residence in Oslo, a former monastery. In 1579 the then mayor of Oslo, Christen Mule, built a Renaissance building on the ruins of the previous bishop's palace, and in this building King James VI of Scotland married princess Anne of Denmark on November 23, 1589. After a fire in 1722, the current manor house (Oslo Ladeg√•rd) was erected by Karen Toller on the site in 1725. Oslo Ladeg√•rd was built in classical Baroque architecture style on the foundation of former Bishop's Palace. Today the manor house is used by the City of Oslo as a museum and concert hall.

The three components distinctive to this modality are: (1) a collimator pair that defines the length of the strip, (2) a binary multileaf collimator whose leaves open and close during treatment to modulate the strip‚Äôs intensity, and (3) a couch that scans the patient across the beam at a fixed speed the during treatment delivery. General principles The treatment field‚Äôs length is selectable. In static-jaw delivery, the field length remains constant during a treatment. In dynamic-jaw delivery, the field length changes so that it begins and ends at its minimum setting. Patient undergoing tomotherapy, face and body covered, to prevent movement. TomoTherapy treatment times vary compared to normal radiation therapy treatment times (tomotherapy treatment times can be as low as 6.5 minutes for common prostate treatment) but do add an additional 2-3 minutes for a daily CT. The daily CT is used to precisely place the radiation beam and allows the operator to modify the treatment should the patient's anatomy change due to weight loss or tumor shrinkage (image-guided radiation therapy). There are few head to head comparisons of tomotherapy and other IMRT techniques, however there is some evidence that VMAT can provide faster treatment while tomotherapy is better able to spare surrounding healthy tissue while delivering a uniform dose.  Helical Delivery  In helical tomotherapy, the linac rotates on its gantry at a constant speed while the beam is delivered; so that from the patient‚Äôs perspective, the shape traced out by the linac is helical. While helical tomotherapy can treat very long volumes without a need to abut fields in the longitudinal direction, it does display a distinct artifact due to \\"thread effect\\" when treating non-central tumors. Thread effect can be suppressed during planning through good pitch selection.  Fixed-Angle Delivery  Fixed-angle tomotherapy uses multiple tomotherapy beams, each delivered from a separate fixed gantry angle, in which only the couch moves during beam delivery. This is branded as TomoDirect, but has also been called topotherapy. The technology enables fixed beam treatments by moving the patient through the machine bore while maintaining specified beam angles. Clinical Considerations Lung cancer, head and neck tumors, breast cancer, prostate cancer, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are some examples of treatments commonly performed using tomotherapy. In general, radiation therapy (or radiotherapy) has developed with a strong reliance on homogeneity of dose throughout the tumor. Tomotherapy embodies the sequential delivery of radiation to different parts of the tumor which raises two important issues. First, this method is known as \\"field matching\\" and brings with it the possibility of a less-than-perfect match between two adjacent fields with a resultant hot and/or cold spot within the tumor. The second issue is that if the patient or tumor moves during this sequential delivery, then again, a hot or cold spot will result. The first problem is reduced by use of a helical motion, as in spiral computed tomography. Some research has suggested tomotherapy provides more conformal treatment plans and decreased acute toxicity. Non-helical static beam techniques such as IMRT and TomoDirect are well suited to whole breast radiation therapy. These treatment modes avoid the low-dose integral splay and long treatment times associated with helical approaches by confining dose delivery to tangential angles. This risk is accentuated in younger patients with early-stage breast cancer, where cure rates are high and life expectancy is substantial. Static beam angle approaches aim to maximize the therapeutic ratio by ensuring that the tumor control probability (TCP) significantly outweighs the associated normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). History The tomotherapy technique was developed in the early 1990s at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison by Professor Thomas Rockwell Mackie and Paul Reckwerdt. A small megavoltage x-ray source was mounted in a similar fashion to a CT x-ray source, and the geometry provided the opportunity to provide CT images of the body in the treatment setup position. Although original plans were to include kilovoltage CT imaging, current models use megavoltage energies. With this combination, the unit was one of the first devices capable of providing modern image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). The first implementation of tomotherapy was the Corvus system developed by Nomos Corporation, with the first patient treated in April, 1994. This was the first commercial system for planning and delivering intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The original system, designed solely for use in the brain, incorporated a rigid skull-based fixation system to prevent patient motion between the delivery of each slice of radiation. But some users eschewed the fixation system and applied the technique to tumors in many different parts of the body. At this time, the systems manufactured by Accuray (previously TomoTherapy Inc.) are the primary tomotherapy devices in use. Mobile tomotherapy Due to their internal shielding and small footprint, TomoTherapy Hi-Art and TomoTherapy TomoHD treatment machines were the only high energy radiotherapy treatment machines used in relocatable radiotherapy treatment suites. Two different types of suites were available: TomoMobile developed by TomoTherapy Inc. which was a moveable truck; and Pioneer, developed by UK-based Oncology Systems Limited. The latter was developed to meet the requirements of UK and European transport law requirements and was a contained unit placed on a concrete pad, delivering radiotherapy treatments in less than five weeks.

The players were discontented by the game's big decline in television coverage in 1989 and the early 1990s, and by what they saw as the BDO's inability to reverse that decline, culminating in 16 top ranked players, including every previous world champion who was still active, breaking away from the BDO to form their own organisation, the World Darts Council (WDC). The BDO responded by banning the 16 defectors from all BDO-sanctioned darts events, which included prohibition of remaining BDO affiliated players from even engaging in exhibition matches against any of the defectors. At the BDO's behest, this was endorsed at a World Darts Federation meeting and became a worldwide sanction. A long-running legal battle followed and ended with a Tomlin order in 1997. The BDO recognised the WDC and the right of players to choose which organisation they played for. In return, the WDC recognised the World Darts Federation as the governing body of world darts, the BDO as the governing body of UK darts, and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). The split in the game remains to this day. The BDO and the PDC have separate pools of players and stage their own tournaments. Each holds its own version of the World Professional Darts Championship. Before the split Darts first appeared on British television in 1962 when Westward Television broadcast the Westward TV Invitational to the south-west of England. 1972 was a big year for darts when ITV started broadcasting the News of the World Championship. Also in 1972 was the start of The Indoor League, which featured a darts tournament, although it was only shown in the Yorkshire Television region in 1972. The Indoor League was shown across Britain on the ITV network from 1973 onwards. The British Darts Organisation (BDO) was formed in 1973 by Olly Croft. The BDO became the governing body of the game in the United Kingdom and would organise darts events for grassroots players right through to the best players in the world. Gradually televised events began to appear more regularly as the 1970s went on and into the 1980s. ITV broadcast the World Masters, British Matchplay, the World Matchplay, the World Cup and other International competitions ‚Äì particularly on its Saturday afternoon sports anthology show World of Sport. The first darts tournament broadcast by the BBC was the 1975 British Open. When the World Championship began in 1978, the BBC picked up the event and also went on to cover the Bullseye Darts Championship, British Gold Cup, British Professional Championship and others in later years. The mass of coverage and amount of prize money in the game led to several players turning professional ‚Äì now able to make a full-time living from the game. Decline in the game Darts players were allowed to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes on the stage during matches, a reflection of the game's roots in British pubs. This behaviour by players was mocked in a Not the Nine O'Clock News sketch in 1980 at the height of darts' popularity. The peak of the darts boom was reached in 1983, when there were more televised darts tournaments than ever before. After 1983, professional darts in Britain began to haemorrhage sponsors and lose television coverage. In 1984, the British Gold Cup (BBC), Butlins Grand Masters (ATV) and British Matchplay (ITV) all stopped being televised as programmes in their own right, although this negative news was partially offset by the creation of the MFI World Matchplay. In September 1985, a big blow came when ITV decided to cancel its World of Sport show which had covered darts events on a regular basis. ITV continued to show darts as programmes in their own right over the next 3 years, but events in the second half of 1988 would rock professional darts to its foundations. In the summer of 1988, the BBC announced that they would be dropping nearly all of their darts coverage after the 1988 British Professional, but wanted to keep broadcasting the World Championship. In October 1988, after the transmission of the 1988 MFI World Matchplay on ITV, ITV announced that they would be withdrawing from all darts coverage at the end of the year, and their final tournament broadcast was the 1988 World Masters. As part of this, the ITV regional channels that covered local darts tournaments cancelled all of them at the end of 1988. As a result of these sudden catastrophic events, 1989 saw a very drastic slump in the amount of darts seen on TV, down to just one tournament, the World Championship. The BDO banned alcohol on stage during all matches from the 1989 World Championship, but the game maintained a poor image to sponsors. Players' unrest Even during the years from 1975 to 1988, when darts was either booming and/or had plenty of prize money and television coverage, there was a certain discontent bubbling under the surface amongst some of the top players, particularly with John Lowe. These issues were about why players lost money whenever they played for their country, why players had no say whatsoever in the running of darts, and why players would be prevented from wearing their personal sponsors on their shirts during tournaments, and also forced to wear BDO sponsors. Lowe mentions in his autobiography, entitled Old Stoneface, that he was prevented from wearing his sponsor Unicorn on his shirt during tournaments, and was compelled to allow Unicorn's rivals Winmau to be put on his shirt instead for free. Lowe mentions that he and some other players would hold meetings with the BDO about these issues, but that nothing really changed. Due to the widespread television coverage and the prize money in darts at this time, any confrontations between the complainants and the BDO, never became too serious until 1988, when all remaining darts tournaments on television, except the World Championship, were getting cancelled after being held for the last time. Many players had become full-time professionals during darts' peak years in the 1980s, and the big sudden drop in the amount of darts television coverage in 1989 left them with very little prize money to play for. It also meant a lack of exposure, which would make it very tough for them to make a living from exhibition matches. The top players felt that not enough was being done by the BDO to encourage new sponsors into their sport and television coverage should be greater than just one event per year. In August 1988, a pressure group named the Darts Council had been formed by some top players and their agents, due to their concern about the imminent disappearance of darts television coverage. After over 3 years of internal pressure from the Darts Council had failed to produce any noticeable results from the BDO hierarchy, 16 professional players, including every previous BDO World Champion who was still active in the game, created their own darts organisation originally named the World Darts Council (WDC) in January 1992. They wanted to appoint a public relations consultant to improve the image of the game and to get more tournaments on television. The WDC staged their first televised event in October 1992 (the Lada UK Masters on Anglia Television). The final straw which had led to the decision to form the World Darts Council in January 1992 was the BDO's quick release of a VHS videotape which featured extended highlights of the 1992 Embassy World Championship Final between Phil Taylor and Mike Gregory. The videotape also featured brief highlights of the 1983, 1985 and 1987 Embassy World Championship Finals featuring Eric Bristow, John Lowe and Keith Deller, as well as Paul Lim's 9-dart finish from the 1990 Embassy World Championship. None of the featured players, nor their agents, were offered payment for the release of the VHS videotape. The 1993 World Championship The WDC badge worn at the 1993 World Championship. The 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last time that all the players played in one unified world darts championship. The WDC players wore their new insignia on their sleeves during the tournament, but were told to remove them by the BDO.History of Darts The WDC players decided that if they were not going to be recognised by the BDO they would no longer play in the Embassy tournament. The BDO did not allow the WDC players to set up their own tournaments and the players decided to go their own way. On 7 January 1993, the 16 WDC players released a statement saying that they would only participate in the 1994 Embassy World Championship if it came under the auspices of the WDC, and that they only recognised the WDC as having the authority to sanction their participation in darts tournaments worldwide. On 24 January 1993, a couple of weeks after the 1993 Embassy World Championship had ended, the BDO responded by suspending the 16 \\"rebel\\" players from all BDO tournaments on British soil. The 16 WDC players who signed the 7 January 1993 statement were: * Phil Taylor * Dennis Priestley * Rod Harrington * John Lowe * Alan Warriner * Eric Bristow * Jocky Wilson * Bob Anderson * Peter Evison * Jamie Harvey * Ritchie Gardner * Cliff Lazarenko * Kevin Spiolek * Keith Deller * Mike Gregory * Chris Johns The list included every previous world darts champion, with the exception of Leighton Rees, the first world champion from 1978, who was not an active player when the split happened. The \\"defectors\\" Satellite broadcaster Sky Sports, which had not existed during the decline of the game, was beginning to become a viable option, following the creation of football's Premier League. In 1993, Sky Sports and the WDC signed a deal to exclusively cover the WDC's version of the World Championship and the World Matchplay from 1994. However, there was trouble ahead. Chris Johns had gone back to the BDO before the TV deal with Sky Sports was announced in order to play in a Welsh international game. In late November 1993, just 4 weeks before the first WDC World Darts Championship was due to get underway, Mike Gregory had a change of heart and was persuaded to return to the BDO. The remaining 14 players managed to remain united under pressure in the weeks following and got their own version of the World Championship off the ground for 1994, with a 24 player field. This 24 player field consisted of the 14 remaining \\"rebel\\" players, Englishmen Graeme Stoddart and Kevin Burrows replacing Chris Johns and Mike Gregory, 7 North American players Larry Butler, Jim Watkins, Sean Downs, Gerald Verrier, Jerry Umberger, Dave Kelly, Steve Brown-USA and Irishman Tom Kirby. The BDO event continued with a largely unknown field ‚Äì although Bobby George produced a resurgent performance to reach the final. The BDO held onto their contract with the BBC to show the event on terrestrial television and began to bring through a new generation of players. Court action On 25 April 1993, at a meeting in Finchley, the BDO took the step of turning the suspension of the WDC players from playing in any BDO-run tournaments on British soil, into a full-scale ban on the WDC players from being able to play any BDO-sanctioned darts, even down to county level. The BDO also passed a motion which said that any BDO players who participated in exhibition events with WDC players, would also be banned from the BDO. The BDO passed the following motions at the 25 April 1993 Finchley meeting: * Any British Darts Organisation official, or British Darts Organisation player, who is associated with the activities of the World Darts Council shall forfeit the right to organise, attend or participate in any events under the jurisdiction of the British Darts Organisation, or its members, until written undertaking is given that they are no longer associated with the World Darts Council or its activities. Motion passed by 57 votes for to 0 votes against. * All member counties shall refrain from attending, or assisting in, any exhibitions involving the 16 players named in the World Darts Council statement of 7 January 1993, any players who have affiliated to the World Darts Council since that date, and any players who may affiliate to the World Darts Council in the future. Motion passed by 54 votes for to 1 vote against. * All member counties shall exclude any players who are affiliated to the World Darts Council from darts events under their jurisdiction. Motion passed by 60 votes for to 0 votes against. On 18 October 1993, at a WDF meeting in Las Vegas, the BDO sought to have their bans on the WDC players officially ratified and set in stone on a world scale in the WDF rules, and the Welsh WDF representative moved the motion that the WDC players be referred to as the \\"former top players\\". The motion passed by 24 votes for to 3 votes against. Two countries who voted against the motion at the Las Vegas meeting, the USA and Canada, were the only two countries whose WDF affiliates refused to sanction the ban even after the vote, saying that what they were being asked to do was against their countries' constitutions, and would therefore be breaking the law. The WDC took advantage of this to invite 7 American darts players to play in the 1994 WDC World Darts Championship. The blanket BDO ban on the WDC led to a protracted four-year legal battle, which would incur large costs for both sides. The two bodies reached an out-of-court settlement on 30 June 1997 in the form of a Tomlin order.Extracts from Tomlin order (see page 13 Word Document) The BDO recognized the WDC and agreed that all players shall have the freedom of choice as to which open events they wish to play in. The WDC dropped its claim to be a world governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). The PDC accepted / recognized the WDF as the governing body for the Sport of Darts worldwide, and the BDO the governing body for darts in the UK. The stated purpose of the agreement was to promote the freedom of individual darts players to participate freely in open competition. Player eligibility Despite the Tomlin Order, eligibility for tournaments is somewhat complicated and possibly controversial. Initially, some BDO players took the opportunity to play in the PDC World Matchplay between 1997 and 2001, and in the PDC World Grand Prix from 1998 to 2001 ‚Äì but since the start of 2002, entry to these tournaments and most other PDC majors has been restricted to members of the Professional Dart Players Association, which looks after PDC players. Most PDC tournaments are now usually restricted to members of the PDPA. To play in a BDO / WDF tournament, a player must agree to comply with the rules of the 1997 Tomlin Order and remain eligible for the BDO World Masters and World Championship, which effectively means not become a member of the PDPA. Players therefore usually have to choose whether to be affiliated to the PDC or the BDO and stay within the jurisdiction of that organisation. However, there are notable exceptions. PDPA Players Championships and Open events often allow residents of the host country to participate regardless of being a PDPA member or not. This leads to anomalies such as Michael van Gerwen winning the PDC Open Holland in 2006 whilst being a BDO player at the time. Another exception is made for major Dutch televised tournaments. They were previously staged under BDO / WDF qualification rules, but when the most famous Dutch player Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC, the tournament organisers insisted on inviting PDC players. An agreement was made with the BDO to allow a number of PDC wildcards for each event. Three more top Dutch players joined the PDC in January 2007 which adds more confusion to player eligibility rules for these events. (see International Darts League and World Darts Trophy) The Grand Slam of Darts (organised by the PDC) is the first major tournament staged in the United Kingdom to feature players from both sides of the darting divide. Inaugurated in 2007 it also featured a return to darts broadcasting for ITV and in 2008 was broadcast exclusively live on ITV4. Players who reached the latter stages of all the major PDC and BDO tournaments over a two-year period were invited, and all but one (the then BDO World Champion Martin Adams) accepted the invitation until 2015. Phil Taylor won the competition in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011. BDO member Scott Waites won the title in 2010. Standing of organisations Opinion is split as to which is the most prestigious title to win. The prize money is far greater in the PDC World Championship and the field contains the majority of the best players in the world. However the British Darts Organisation title has been in existence since 1978 and is generally better known to the UK public due to its coverage on the BBC. At the time of the split itself all the previous World Champions and top ranked players left to join the WDC. Between April 1993 and June 1997, the WDC needed to find as much money as possible to fund their legal action against the BDO, which was being taken in order to remove the blanket ban on their players passed at the April 1993 Finchley meeting. As a result of the financial difficulties for the WDC at this time, the 1993‚Äì1997 period was about survival and consolidation for the WDC rather than growth and expansion. The World Championship featured a group stage which guaranteed at least two television appearances for its players. Several of these players, including Jocky Wilson, who retired shortly after the split in 1995, Eric Bristow, Keith Deller and Cliff Lazarenko, had all been in a downward spiral of form for a few years. After the Tomlin Order of June 1997, the WDC changed its name to the PDC and they could start growing and expanding. The group stage at the PDC World Championship was scrapped for the 1999 championship, and the tournament has been conducted in a single elimination format since then with the number of participants gradually increasing. The BDO began to bring through several players from their county system which continued to improve the standard of the organisation which had been decimated by the split. In the 2002 PDC World Darts Championship, the total prize fund of the PDC version overtook the BDO event for the first time. The same year, six prominent BDO players ‚Äì Steve Beaton, Ronnie Baxter, Chris Mason, Kevin Painter, Andy Jenkins and Paul Williams ‚Äì opted to compete in the PDC version of the World Championship. In 2015, the PDC world championship boasted a prize fund of ¬£1.25 million, with ¬£250,000 for the winner, compared with a prize fund of ¬£339,000 in the BDO and ¬£100,000 for the winner. In two years, 25 players earned ¬£100,000 or more on the PDC circuit.BDO world championship is a faltering relic that‚Äôs worth clinging on to In recent years, numerous high-profile BDO players have \\"defected\\" to the PDC, attracted by the greater prize money on offer. This is perceived as having widened the gap in quality between the two organisations, to the extent that in 2015 one commentator described the BDO as \\"mostly an unwilling feeder to the PDC: most of its biggest stars... jump ship given the chance.\\" The list of defectors includes post-split BDO champions John Part, Richie Burnett, Steve Beaton, Les Wallace, Raymond van Barneveld, Jelle Klaasen, Mark Webster, Christian Kist, Stephen Bunting and Glen Durrant, as well as other top players such as Mervyn King, Kevin Painter, Ronnie Baxter, James Wade, Gary Anderson, Michael van Gerwen, Wayne Mardle, Dave Chisnall and Simon Whitlock. In January 2019, Glen Durrant announced that he would be switching to the PDC, shortly after winning his third consecutive BDO World Championship. By comparison, relatively few players have switched from the PDC to the BDO. 2004 BDO world champion Andy Fordham switched to the PDC in 2009, before returning to the BDO in 2013. Two-time BDO champion Ted Hankey moved to the PDC in 2012 and switched back two years later. Three time BDO women's champion Anastasia Dobromyslova moved to the PDC in 2008 and moved back in 2011. Simon Whitlock moved to the BDO from the PDC, before subsequently switching back again. There is no definitive World Champion in the game, and players from the rival organisations rarely face each other, except in the Grand Slam of Darts, to which the top BDO players are invited. 16 times world champion (2 BDO, 14 PDC) Phil Taylor has twice defeated the reigning BDO champion in an official challenge match: Raymond van Barneveld in 1999 and Andy Fordham in 2004. Former BDO stalwarts John Part and van Barneveld have won the PDC World Championship having previously won the BDO version. In addition, reigning BDO World Champion Mark Webster defeated PDC World Champion John Part 10-2 in legs in the second round of the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. BDO player Scott Waites won the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts. Waites is the only BDO player to reach the final of the event. PDC bid to take over BDO On 21 October 2009, Barry Hearn made a bid of ¬£1 million to purchase the BDO.PDC Make BDO Offer planetdarts.tv It was the first time that a formal offer had been made public to end the 17-year split between the two organisations. However, later in the day, BDO founder Olly Croft rejected the proposal.BDO founder rejects takeover by Barry Hearn's PDC guardian.co.uk A few months after the takeover offer and in the aftermath of the two organisations' 2010 World Championships, it was revealed and understood that the county organisations had asked the BDO board to consider the offer more seriously.BDO chief Olly Croft is 'working on' PDC's takeover bid bbc.co.uk  BDO lifting of PDC restrictions  On 23 August 2018, under new chairman Derek Jacklin, the BDO made the decision to modify their eligibility rules. All PDC tour card holders were now permitted to enter BDO events, with the rule changes coming into effect on 1 October of the same year. The decision was made to allow female players to enter the PDC Ladies play-offs (for two spots in the PDC World Championship) without the loss of status in the BDO. This rule change also allows all players that compete in the BDO to enter the PDC Q-School without penalty. The PDPA still retains all streaming/television restrictions on PDPA tour card holders in non-PDC sanctioned events.https://www.live- darts.com/category/bdo-darts-news/bdo-lift-sanctions-on-pdc-players-20180822/ See also *List of darts players who have switched organisation *Comparison of rugby league and rugby union split in organisation References Category:Darts Category:British Darts Organisation Category:Professional Darts Corporation ","title":"Split in darts"},{"id":"10967572","text":"George Johnstone, (April 18, 1846 ‚Äì March 8, 1921) was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for South Carolina's 3rd congressional district.

It is a member of the Multi- State Lottery Association (MUSL). Draw games include Mega Millions, Powerball, The Pick, Fantasy 5, Pick 3, and Triple Twist. A variety of instant scratch tickets, or Scratchers, are also offered. The Arizona Lottery's mission statement is to support Arizona programs for the public benefit by maximizing revenue in a responsible manner. Arizona became the first state west of the Mississippi to approve a lottery when the statewide public initiative passed in November 1980. In 2002, a vote to extend the lottery for another 10 years was passed, with 73% in favor. In 2010, the Lottery was extended into 2035. The first sale from the Arizona Lottery was on July 1, 1981. The product was an instant scratch ticket called Scratch It Rich. Proceeds from sales of Arizona Lottery tickets, nearly $4 million weekly, fund a variety of state programs. In fiscal year 2016, the Arizona Lottery transferred over $205 million to these programs. The Lottery transfers money to 12 funds that serve 18 beneficiaries. There are six core Arizona Lottery pillars that these 18 beneficiaries align with: arts and education; community enrichment; economic development; environmental conservation; health and human services; and public safety. Arizona requires lottery players to be at least 21; the minimum age was 18 until June 1, 2003. The Pick The Pick is an in-state jackpot game; its first drawing was October 13, 1984. Its largest jackpot was $13.5 million in 2007. The Pick is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays at 8:00 PM MST. Plays are $1. Jackpots begin at $1 million. Its players can add EXTRA!. The Pick draws 6 of 44 numbers. Triple Twist Triple Twist is an in-state jackpot game, with the first drawing held on December 17, 2018. Each play costs $2 for three rows (two of the three rows are quick pick). Jackpots start at $200,000. The largest jackpot ever claimed was $1.9 million back on May 22, 2019 located in Tucson. The draw type is 6 from 42 numbers. Powerball Arizona participated in its first Powerball drawing on April 3, 1994, when the lottery became a member of MUSL. To date, 12 jackpot winners have won in Arizona. Powerball is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. Each play is $2 ($3 with Power Play) Starting jackpot is $40 million (annuitized with cash option.) Mega Millions First Mega Millions Drawing for Arizona: April 8, 2010 The Arizona Lottery began selling Mega Millions tickets in April 2010. The state is waiting for its first Mega Millions jackpot winner. However, 6 lucky players have won second place prizes of $1 million or more during the past six years. On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball in US lottery jurisdictions. Most lotteries with either game began selling tickets for both on January 31, 2010. Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18, 2010. For an extra $1 the winnings may be multiplied by up to 5 with the Megaplier option. On November 1, 2017, Mega Millions became a two dollar play. The Trio On November 1, 2017 Mega Millions increased from $1 to $2 and the Trio became $5. The Trio consists of one Powerball ticket, one Mega Millions ticket, and one The Pick ticket. Powerball and Mega Millions (national games) are both $2 per play, while The Pick (an Arizona-only game) is $1 per play. Fantasy 5 Fantasy 5 is also drawn six nights a week. It draws 5 of 41 numbers. Its minimum jackpot is $50,000, increasing until there is a 5-of-5 winner. Games are $1. Fantasy 5 has an add-on game, EXTRA!.  Pick 3  Pick 3 is drawn Mondays through Saturdays. The prize for an exact match (Straight) is $250 on a 50-cent wager, or $500 on a $1 wager.  Scratchers  First Scratchers Ticket: Scratch it Rich The first Arizona Lottery ticket was a Scratchers ticket called Scratch it Rich. The game launched on July 1, 1981. Since then, the Arizona Lottery has sold nearly 1,000 different versions of its Scratchers tickets. The state‚Äôs longest running, most popular Scratchers tickets include: {  Game Original Launch Consecutive Years Available Price Point Average Number of Tickets Sold Each Year - Crossword Jan. 25, 1999 17 years $2 16.6 million - Red Hot 7‚Äôs June 7, 1999 17 years $2 3.5 million - Bingo Nov. 27, 1995 21 years $2 11 million } Unusual Scratchers Ticket Prizes Arizona Lottery winners have received more than just cash prizes in the past 35 years. Some of the most unusual Scratchers prizes have included hot air balloon rides, a Caribbean cruise, a Las Vegas game show experience, a Phoenix Suns travel package, a trip to Caesar‚Äôs Palace, a seat in the 2011 World Series of Poker Main Event and a contestant spot on an episode of Wheel of Fortune featuring lottery winners exclusively.

It is a water-soluble version of disuccinimidyl suberate.  Crosslinkers  Crosslinkers are chemical reagents that play a crucial role in the preparation of conjugates used in biological research particularly immuno- technologies and protein studies. Crosslinkers are designed to covalently interact with molecules of interest, resulting in conjugation. A spacer arm, generally consisting of several atoms, separates the two molecules, and the nature and length of this spacer is important to consider when designing an assay involving the selected crosslinker. Bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate is an example of a homobifunctional crosslinker.  Characteristics  Water- soluble: BS3 is hydrophilic due to its terminal sulfonyl substituents and as a result dissociates in water, eliminating the need to use organic solvents which interfere with protein structure and function. Because organic solvents need not be used when BS3 is used as the crosslinker, it is ideal for investigations into protein structure and function in physiologic conditions. Non-cleavable: The BS3 crosslinker has an 8-atom spacer is non-cleavable and the molecule is not cell membrane permeable. BS3 binds irreversibly to its conjugate molecules, meaning that once BS3 creates covalent linkages to its target molecules, those associations are not easily broken. Membrane impermeable: Since BS3 is a charged molecule, it cannot freely pass through cellular membranes which makes it an ideal crosslinker for cell surface proteins. Homobifunctional: BS3 is a homobifunctional crosslinker in that it has two identical reactive groups, i.e. the N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide esters, and only one step is necessary to establish crosslinking between conjugate molecules. Amine reactive: BS3 is amine-reactive in that its N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) esters at each end react specifically with primary amines to form stable amide bonds in a nucleophilic acyl substitution- type reaction in which the N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide acts as the leaving group. BS3 is particularly useful in protein-related applications in that it can react with the primary amines on the side chain of lysine residues and the N-terminus of polypeptide chains. This crosslinker can also be used to stabilize protein-protein interactions for further analysis by immunoprecipitation.  Deuterated BS3  The deuterated crosslinker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) 2,2,7,7-suberate-d4 is the \\"heavy\\" BS3 crosslinking agent that contains 4 deuterium atoms. When used in mass spectrometry studies, BS3-d4 provides a 4 dalton shift compared to crosslinked proteins with the non-deuterated analog (BS3-d0). Thus, \\"heavy\\" and \\"light\\" crosslinker analogs can be used for isotopically labeling protein and peptides in mass spectrometry research applications.  Applications  * Cell-surface receptor-ligand studies * Crosslinking biomolecules on cells * Fixation of protein complexes prior to protein interaction analysis  Disuccinimidyl suberate  Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) is the non-water-soluble analog of BS3. DSS and BS3 express the same crosslinking ability toward primary amines. The major structural difference between these two molecules is that DSS does not contain the sulfonate substituents at either end of the molecule, and it is this difference that is responsible for the uncharged, non-polar nature of the DSS molecule. Due to the hydrophobic nature of this crosslinker it must be dissolved in an organic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide before being added to an aqueous sample. Because of the ability of DSS to cross cell membranes, it is best suited for applications where intracelluclar crosslinking is needed. :Chemical structure of disuccinimidyl suberate  References Category:Sulfonic acids Category:Succinimides ","title":"Bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate"},{"id":"10967628","text":"No Pleasantries is the debut album of American post-grunge band U.P.O.

Biography Infanta Sof√≠a was born on 29 April 2007 at 16:50 in the Ruber International Hospital in Madrid by means of a caesarean section, two days after due date. Like her elder sister, her birth was announced by the royal family to the press via SMS. It was announced that her umbilical cord stem cells would be sent to a European private bank in Belgium and to a Spanish public one. The parents, then the Prince and Princess of Asturias, did the same with Leonor's cells: they were taken to a private center in Arizona, which caused controversy in Spain. Sof√≠a was named after her paternal grandmother, Queen Sof√≠a. She was christened on 15 July in the gardens of the Palacio de la Zarzuela. Her godparents are Paloma Rocasolano (her maternal grandmother) and Konstantin, Prince of Vidin. Like her sister, she was given one name, with the additional name of (of All the Saints), at her christening, a Bourbon tradition.

Prior to 2018, Delaware was one of only four jurisdictions where wagering on sports was legal under federal law, although it had not permitted such betting since a game based on final scores in the National Football League (NFL) was available for only the 1976 season. However, a bill was signed by the Governor of Delaware in May 2009 that is much broader than the previous sports wagering law. (The other US jurisdictions exempted from the federal ban on sports gambling under the Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act were Montana, Nevada, and Oregon.) In August 2009, a federal court limited sports gambling in Delaware to NFL parlays, based on what Delaware had offered prior to 1992. On June 5, 2018, after the Supreme Court ruled PASPA unconstitutional, the Delaware Lottery expanded sports betting to include additional sports and single-game bets. In January 2010, legislation was passed legalizing Lottery-owned table games at Delaware's three racetrack casinos (\\"racinos\\".) The minimum age to play the Delaware Lottery is 18, except for video lottery and sports betting, which have a minimum age of 21. As Delaware's liquor stores do not allow underage persons in them, the minimum age to purchase tickets in such establishments is effectively 21. Sports Pick Sports Pick is the brand name for sports betting offered by the Delaware Lottery. Prior to 2018, the Delaware Lottery offered limited sports betting consisting of parlay betting and championship futures on National Football League (NFL) only; betting was available at casino sportsbooks and at retailers throughout the state. Delaware had made a failed attempt at legalized sports betting in 1976 and received a partial exemption from a federal ban on sports betting under the Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act in 1992. On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the ban on sports betting in the case Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association. On June 5, 2018, the Delaware Lottery expanded sports betting to single-game and championship wagers on professional and college sports (excluding Delaware college teams) including football, baseball, basketball, hockey, soccer, boxing/MMA, golf, and auto racing. The expanded sports betting is available at the state's three casinos ‚Äì Casino at Delaware Park, Dover Downs, and Harrington Raceway & Casino. Parlay betting on NFL and college football games (excluding Delaware teams) is available at retailers throughout the state. Parlay Betting: Regular season: *Half-point parlays *Teasers (6 points) *Super Teasers (10 points) *Reverse Teasers (-7 points) *$100,000 Parlay Card *Future book wagering All spreads on Half-point parlays, Teasers, SuperTeasers, and Reverse Teasers have half point spreads to eliminate ties. $100,000 Parlay Card has integer spreads and ties lose. Postseason: *Half- point parlays *Teasers (6 points) *Reverse Teasers (-7 points) *Playoff Special cards *Future book wagering Current draw games In-house draw games Play 3 Play 3 is drawn twice a day. Play 4 Play 4 also is drawn twice a day. Both games involve matching the digits 0 through 9. Multi-Win Lotto Multi-Win is played Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Cash jackpots begin at $50,000. Six numbers from 1 through 35 are drawn. Each $2 game features 3 lines of play. In addition to winning in the \\"classic\\" way (matching in any six-number play), prizes also are won by matching enough of the 18 numbers across the three lines to the six numbers drawn; \\"combined play\\" also wins if none of the 18 match the numbers drawn. Keno Delaware Keno is a keno game drawn every few minutes that began in January 2013 in 81 businesses. Multi-state draw games Lotto America Lotto America is available through 13 lotteries including Delaware's, and is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. Lotto America draws five white numbers from 1 through 52, and a \\"Star Ball\\", numbered 1 through 10. The jackpots begin at $2,000,000. Lotto America also has an option called All-Star Bonus that multiplies non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, or 5. Lucky For Life In January 2015, Delaware began selling Lucky For Life, a lesser multi-state game with a $2 price. The game offers a top prize of $1,000 a day for life. Second prize is $25,000 a year for life. The game had only been available for people in the six New England states until January 27, 2015. Drawings will take place on Monday and Thursday evenings. Those drawings will be conducted by the Connecticut Lottery. Mega Millions On October 13, 2009 the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball in US lottery jurisdictions. The Delaware Lottery added Mega Millions on the date of the cross-selling expansion, January 31, 2010. Mega Millions' jackpots currently start at $40 million; it is drawn Tuesday and Friday nights. Powerball Since 1991, Delaware has been a member of MUSL. Powerball began in 1992. Powerball's jackpots currently start at $40 million; it is drawn Wednesday and Saturday nights. Former multi- state draw games Hot Lotto Hot Lotto was available through 15 lotteries including Delaware's, and was drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. Hot Lotto drew five white numbers from 1 through 47, and an orange \\"Hot Ball\\", numbered 1 through 19. The jackpots began at $1,000,000 (all-cash, and \\"taxes- paid\\"), increasing by at least $50,000 if there is no top prize winner. Hot Lotto also had an option, called Sizzler (similar to Powerball's PowerPlay); the Sizzler tripled non-jackpot prizes. The Hot Lotto game underwent a major change on May 12, 2013. Eight \\"white balls\\" were added, although the \\"Hot Ball\\" field remained at 19 numbers. The top prize changed from annuity-with-a- cash-option to will all-cash, and \\"taxes paid\\" (jackpot amounts reflect the net amount to be won, rather than the gross.) Hot Lotto had its last drawing on October 28, 2017. Video lottery Delaware has three lottery-sponsored casinos ‚Äì Casino at Delaware Park, Dover Downs, and Harrington Raceway & Casino ‚Äì whose games include MUSL's MegaHits.

The Metropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando () formerly Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption is a neo-classical church in the City of San Fernando, in Pampanga Province of the Philippines. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of San Fernando. History In 1755 the first structure of wood and thatch was built on this site by the Augustinian friars under the patronage of San Fernando III, King of Castile. Fray Sebastian Moreno, O.S.A. was its first cura parroco. On October 17, 1757, townsfolk petitioned the governor-general for exemptions from tribute to enable them to build the church and convent. It was transferred to the care of secular priests in 1788. The construction of the present style church started during the same year under the supervision Fr. Manuel Canlas, its first secular cura parroco, and a committee composed of the principales of the town. They were led by gobernadorcillo Bernabe Pamintuan. Construction was completed in 1808. The church was rededicated to the Assumption of Our Lady. The church measures 70m. long, 13m. wide and 11m. high. The round majestic dome rising from the rotunda of the transept is reminiscent of the Baroque style with some Renaissance elements. President Emilio F. Aguinaldo and his cabinet viewed the Philippine Revolutionary Army from the windows of the convento on October 9, 1898. On orders of Gen. Antonio Luna, the Philippine Revolutionary Army burned the church and convento on May 4, 1899. 20th century The church was destroyed by fire again in 1939, and restored by Pampango Architect Fernando H. Ocampo in 1948. In 1948 the church was elevated to Cathedral when it became the seat of the Diocese of San Fernando, canonically created by Pope Pius XII. In 1975, the diocese was elevated by Pope Paul VI, to Archdiocese of San Fernando. Its first bishop was Monsignor Cesar Ma. Guerrero, D.D. He was followed by the Most Reverend Emilio A. Cinense, D.D., who became its first archbishop. He was succeeded by the Most Reverend Oscar V. Cruz, D.D. in 1978. The third archbishop of San Fernando is the Most Reverend Paciano B. Aniceto, D.D.

Club career Budalic began his soccer career at the college level with the James Madison University. In 2001, he was selected by the Toronto Lynx in the first round of the USL A-League 2001 College Draft, but decided to continue his education back home at Wilfrid Laurier University where he led the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks to the CIS championship. After the college season came to a conclusion he played with the Glen Shields Sun Devils in the Canadian Professional Soccer League. In 2003, he signed a contract with the Toronto Lynx. He made his debut on April 20, 2002 against the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. He recorded his first goal on April 26, 2002 against Richmond Kickers in a 1-1 draw. In his rookie season he nearly helped the Lynx qualify for the postseason, but a tie in the final game of season against Atlanta Silverbacks made the Charlotte Eagles take the final playoff spot. He finished the season with twelve goals and was named Team of the Week three times. The club also recognized him with their Best Offensive Player award, and was also named the A-League Rookie of the Year. Just weeks before the start of the 2003 season the Lynx announced Budalic had been transferred to √ñrebro SK in the Swedish First Division, where he was re-united with former Lynx player Chris Pozniak. He was also named to the Canada national soccer team roster for a friendly against Germany, but did not feature in the match. In 2004, he returned to Canada to sign with Montreal Impact. During his tenure with Montreal he had difficulty getting sufficient playing time with the competition of well-established strikers. He was later transferred to F.K. Haugesund where he helped the club win promotion to the Adeccoligaen in 2005. In 2006, he was released by Haugesund, which marked his return to Canada to sign with the Serbian White Eagles of the Canadian Soccer League. In his debut season he clinched the International Division title for the club. He featured in the CSL Championship match against Italia Shooters, but lost the game to a score of 1-0. The following season he assisted in securing the club's second division title, and contributed a goal in a 2-1 victory over Windsor Border Stars. He featured in the championship match against rivals Toronto Croatia, but suffered a 4-1 defeat on goals on aggregate. On September 17, 2007, Budalic played a game for the Toronto FC reserve team against the Real Salt Lake reserve team, and scored a goal in the 22nd minute. In 2008, he was named team captain of the Serbian White Eagles for the 2008 season. He helped secure a postseason by finishing second in their division. In the playoffs, he recorded a goal in a 3-0 victory against Italia. For the third straight year he reached the championship final this time they faced the Trois-Rivi√®res Attak, where he won his first championship in a 2-1 victory in a penalty shootout. In 2009, he claimed his third division title and reached the championship final for the fourth time, but were defeated by the Attak in a penalty shootout. The following year he retired from competitive soccer in order to coach the White Eagles. He briefly returned to soccer in 2013 to play with K-W United FC in the USL Premier Development League.  Managerial career  After his retirement from soccer he was appointed the head coach for the Serbian White Eagles. Budalic served as director of soccer operations for K-W United, leading the team to the PDL championship in 2015. He was also an assistant coach for the women's and men's soccer teams at Wilfrid Laurier University and director of football for Beswicks Sports North America before joining Orlando City on 26 January 2016, as an assistant general manager, where he had to report directly to founder and president Phil Rawlins.Niki Budalic Joins Orlando City as Assistant General Manager, orlandocitysc.com, 25 January 2019 On 14 December 2016, he was promoted to general manager, soccer operations at Orlando City, Orlando Pride and Orlando City B.Orlando City SC‚Äôs Niki Budalic Promoted To General Manager, Soccer Operations, orlandocitysc.com, 14 December 2016 He left the club in late November.

It mediates the rather delayed cascade of two TLR-associated signaling cascades, where the other one is dependent upon a MyD88 adapter. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize specific components of microbial invaders and activate an immune response to these pathogens. After these receptors recognize highly conserved pathogenic patterns, a downstream signaling cascade is activated in order to stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as to upregulate the expression of immune cells. All TLRs have a TIR domain that initiates the signaling cascade through TIR adapters. Adapters are platforms that organize downstream signaling cascades leading to a specific cellular response after exposure to a given pathogen.  Structure  TRIF is primarily active in the spleen and is often regulated when MyD88 is deficient in the liver, indicating organ-specific regulation of signaling pathways. Curiously, there is a lack of redundancy within the TLR4 signaling pathway that leads to microbial evasion of immune response in the host after mutations occur within intermediates of the pathway.Palsson-McDermott, Eva and Luke A J O‚ÄôNeill (2004) Immunology. 113(2) 153-162 Three TRAF-binding motifs present in the amino terminal region of TRIF are necessary for association with TRAF6. Destruction of these motifs reduced the activation of NF-Œ∫B, a transcription factor that is also activated by the carboxy-terminal domain of TRIF in the upregulation of cytokines and co-stimulatory immune molecules. This domain recruits receptor-interacting protein (RIP1) and RIP3 through the RIP homotypic interaction motif. Cells deficient for RIP1 gene display attenuated TLR3 activation of NF-Œ∫B, indicating the use of the RIP1 gene in downstream TRIF activation, in contrast to other TLRs that use IRAK protein for the activation of NF-Œ∫B.Kawai, Taro and Shizuo Akira. (2004). Arthritis Res. Ter. 7(1) 12-19  Areas of research  Investigations into the function of TRIF are of great significance to various fields of biomedical research. The pathogenesis of infectious disease, septic shock, tumor growth, and rheumatoid arthritis all have close ties with TLR signaling pathways, specifically to that of TRIF. Better understanding of the TRIF pathway will be therapeutically useful in the development of vaccines and treatments that can control associated inflammation and antiviral responses. Experiments involving wild-type and TRIF-deficient mice are critical for understanding the coordinated responses of TLR pathways. It is necessary to study the coordinated effects of these pathways in order to understand the complex responses initiated by TRIF.

The company is historically significant in that it was a driving force during the early development of mass marketing and advertising. History In 1871, The Centaur Company was formed by Charles Henry Fletcher at 80 Varick Street, New York City to purchase the rights to and manufacture the laxative Pitcher's Castoria, renamed Fletcher's Castoria after the founder. Together with Demas Barnes and Joseph B. Rose who had purchased the formula for Centaur Liniment that same year, manufacturing began. In 1923 Sterling Drug purchased a 1/4 interest in The Centaur Company and eventually purchased the entire company.New York Times, Feb 9, 1923, Page 24, col 1 ?? In 1934, the Centaur Company Division of Sterling Products (later called Sterling Drug) purchased Z.B.T. products from the Crystal Corporation. In 1984, Sterling Drug sold Centaur's raison d'√™tre product, Fletcher's Castoria, to Mentholatum Co Inc. The Centaur-Caldwell division of Sterling Drug also owned the marketing rights to Dr. William B. Caldwell's \\"Syrup Pepsin\\", manufactured in Monticello, Illinois, until the factory closed in 1985. Two Fletcher's Castoria Bottles, plus rubbings of the signature and product name. Advertising In the 1870s, The Centaur Company began doing significant advertising to create its brands, with a primary emphasis on Castoria. Between 1870 and World War II \\"Children cry for Chas. H. Fletcher's Castoria\\" was one of the best known advertising slogans. At the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, Chas. H. Fletcher painted advertisements on virtually every blank wall in sight; they are quite visible in images of the opening of the bridge. Castoria ads from the 1870s through 1920s are still visible today on the buildings of New York. Advertisement featuring Jumbo Centaur was an early practitioner of the use of celebrities in mass advertising. Centaur Liniment advertising included a purported endorsement from P.T. Barnum. One famous ad had the company represented by Barnum's famous circus star Jumbo, the giant elephant. Another ad featured the legendary boxer Joe Louis. In the 1920s, Centaur was one of the earliest advertisers targeting women directly.\\"Devil-may-care 1920s found papers giving women more voice and space\\", By Martin Kady Journal Now, 1997, Centennial, 1897-1997, Piedmont Publishing \\"Their advertising prior to that had targeted both men and women, but here [in the 1920s] they began to advertise additionally in the new publications specifically targeted to women.\\" There were three \\"Fletcher's Castoria\\" B-17 Flying Fortress bombers during World War II, part of the 100th Bomber Group.

The regulation of this gene is more complex than most other genes in the E. coli genome, as Fis is an important protein which regulates expression of other genes. It is supposed that fis is regulated by H-NS, IHF and CRP. It also regulates its own expression (autoregulation). Fis is one of the most abundant DNA binding proteins in Escherichia coli under nutrient-rich growth conditions.  History  Fis was first discovered for its role in stimulating Gin catalyzed inversion of the G segment of phage Mu genome. Fis was originally identified as the _f_ actor for _i_ nversion _s_ timulation of the homologous Hin and Gin site-specific DNA recombinases of Salmonella and phage Mu, respectively. This small, basic, DNA-bending protein has recently been shown to function in many other reactions including phage lambda site-specific recombination, transcriptional activation of rRNA and tRNA operons, repression of its own synthesis, and oriC-directed DNA replication. Cellular concentrations of Fis vary tremendously under different growth conditions which may have important regulatory implications for the physiological role of Fis in these different reactions.Finkel, S. E., and R. C. Johnson. \\"The Fis protein: it's not just for DNA inversion anymore.\\" Molecular microbiology 6.22 (2006): 3257-3265.  Structure  Fis protein structure Structurally, Fis folds into four Œ±-helices (A‚ÄìD) and a Œ≤-hairpin. Helices A and B provide the contacts between Fis monomers, facilitating dimer formation, whereas the C and D helices form a helix-turn-helix motif that is essential for DNA binding.  Properties and functions  Fis is a very important small nucleotide-associated protein which plays a role in affecting the bacterial chromosome structure and the initiation of DNA replication. It is a nucleoid-associated protein in Escherichia coli that is abundant during early exponential growth in rich medium but is in short supply during stationary phase. When stationary-phase cells are subcultured into a rich medium, Fis levels increase from less than 100 to over 50,000 copies per cell prior to the first cell division. As cells enter exponential growth, nascent synthesis is largely shut off, and intracellular Fis levels decrease as a function of cell division. Fis synthesis also transiently increases when exponentially growing cells are shifted to a richer medium. The magnitude of the peak of Fis synthesis appears to reflect the extent of the nutritional upshift. fis mRNA levels closely resemble the protein expression pattern, suggesting that regulation occurs largely at the transcriptional level. Two RNA polymerase-binding sites and at least six high-affinity Fis-binding sites are present in the fis promoter region. Expression of this fis operon is negatively regulated by Fis in vivo and purified Fis can prevent stable complex formation by RNA polymerase at the fis promoter in vitro. However, autoregulation only partially accounts for the expression pattern of Fis. Fluctuations in Fis levels have been shown to serve as an early signal of a nutritional upshift and is important in the physiological roles Fis plays in the cell. Fis regulation DNA negative supercoiling It is a global regulatory protein in Escherichia coli that activates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription by binding to three upstream activation sites of the rRNA promoter and enhances transcription 5 to 10 fold in vivo. Fis overexpression results in different effects on cell growth depending on nutrient conditions.Leila H. Choe, Wilfred Chen, Kelvin H. Lee, Proteome analysis of factor for inversion stimulation (Fis) overproduction in Escherichia coli,Electrophoresis 1999, 20, 798-805 The Fis nucleoid protein is differentiated by its fast increase in synthesis rates following nutrient upshifts and its abundance in rapidly growing E. coli cells. Fis has been known to activate ribosomal RNA transcription, as well other genes. It has a direct role in upstream activation of rRNA promoters. Fis binds to a recombinational enhancer sequence that is required to stimulate hin-mediated DNA inversion. It has also been shown to prevent initiation of DNA replication from oriC. It has been shown that sequences from 32 to 94 nucleotides upstream of the fis AUG are responsible for increasing fis lacZ translation reporter activities over 100 fold. Within this region, an AU sequence element centered 35 nucleotides upstream of the fis AUG increases fis translation by as much as 15 fold. Formation of a supposed RNA secondary structure element beginning 50 nucleotides upstream of the AUG also positively affects fis translation by up to 10 fold. The fis gene is cotranscribed with the upstream dusB gene encoding a tRNA-modifying enzyme. DusB protein levels are very low even under conditions when there is high transcription of the operon and high levels of Fis protein. Fis has been deemed a bacterial chromatin architectural protein. Besides modulating chromatin architecture, it is known to influence numerous promoters of E. coli and several other bacteria. Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that Fis acts as a transcriptional repressor of mom promoter. There is data that shows Fis mediates its repressive effect by denying access to RNA polymerase at the mom promoter. combined A repressive effect of Fis and previously characterized negative regulatory factors could be responsible to keep the gene silenced most of the time. In addition to bringing about overall downregulation of the Mu genome, it also ensures silencing of the advantageous but potentially lethal mom gene. Fis as a critical regulator of capsule expression. Fis is also involved in the regulation of a range of genes in bacterial species such as P. multocida, Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli,Rossiter, Amanda E., et al. \\"Transcription of the plasmid‚Äêencoded toxin gene from Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli is regulated by a novel co‚Äêactivation mechanism involving CRP and Fis.\\" Molecular microbiology 81.1 (2011): 179-191. similar organisms. Some of these genes include important virulence factors.  Role of Fis in bacterial motility  The role of fis is well studied in E. coli, but its role in pseudomonads has only been examined briefly. Recent studies in Enterobacteriaceae have shown that fis positively regulates the flagellar movement of bacteria. Observations in Pseudomonas putida demonstrate fis reduced the migration of P. putida onto the apices of barley roots and thereby the competitiveness of bacteria on the roots. It was also observed that the overexpression of fis drastically reducing swimming motility and facilitated the formation of P. putida biofilm. It is possible that the elevated expression of Fis is important in the adaptation of P. putida during colonization of plant roots by promoting biofilm formation when the migration of bacteria is no longer advantageous. It was demonstrated that Fis is essential for the stability of the linear plasmid pBSSB1 and affects the motility of S. Typhi. Fis buffers decrease of negative supercoiling in tyrT and rrnA expression. The upstream FIS binding site of rrnA is required for this and it's probable that FIS enables local DNA curvature.

It was established as a parish in 1914. Originally, it encompassed 28 barangays from as far as Anao in Mexico to the east, Dolores to the south, Telabastagan to the north and a number of villages of San Fernando on the west side along what is now known as McArthur Highway. History At the time of its canonical erection in 1914, the parish was under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Manila. However, the growing number of the faithful led to the establishment of more parishes that were established by Archbishop Miguel O‚ÄôDoherty. These were St. Joseph Parish in Brgy. Malino, Mexico in 1941 and Our Lady of Remedies Parish in Brgy. Baliti in 1943, leaving eight barangays under the parish. This was further whittled down to six barangays with the erection of St. Augustine Parish in 1965. The remaining barangays were Calulut (parish center), Sindalan, Dela Paz, Bulaon, San Rafael and Malpitic. The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 and its aftermath affected the boundaries of the parish. A sizeable resettlement community was established in Brgy. Bulaon, prompting the creation of the Personal Parish of the Good Shepherd in 1995. In 1996, the Lord's Ascension Parish was established in Dela Paz Sur, which included the western part of Sindalan. At present, there is a move by the residents of Brgys. San Rafael, Malpitic and Bulaon to join the Parish of the Good Shepherd. If this move is realized, the present parish boundaries will further shrink to include only the whole of Brgy. Calulut and the eastern portion of Brgy. Sindalan. Most of the parishioners then were tenants and farm workers who toiled in the sugar cane fields. Others relied on small farming lots for their income. With the land reform program of the government in the 1970s, many tenants became small landowners. The construction of farm-to-market roads in the same period also facilitated the marketing of their products. However, during the economic crunch of the 1980s, the lots were eventually sold and transformed into fish ponds and poultry farms, with financing from big food processing companies. Other areas were converted into residential and industrial areas as well as memorial parks. The shift in land use resulted in a significant change in the residents' means of livelihood. A huge number are now employed in manufacturing firms and commercial establishments. There are professionals working in hospitals, schools and government offices. Some have become small- scale entrepreneurs with businesses ranging from hardware to sari-sari stores. Festivals San Vicente Ferrer's feast day falls on 5 April. In the past, it was customary to bring the images of all village patron saints to the parish church during the patronal fiesta and the Christmas nine-day Misa de Gallo. Most parishioners hiked from their village of origin; those who could afford took the gareta and calesa. These events were well-attended social and ecclesiastical affairs. Aside from the patronal fiesta, another major parish feast is the \\"Fiestang Corazon\\" (Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) on the 3rd Saturday of October. According to tradition, the harvest season was the reason why the feast is celebrated in thanksgiving on October instead of June, which is the feast's liturgical month. Unknown to many, the parishioners were on the right liturgical track. Research shows that, in pre-Vatican II times, the original feast of the Sacred Heart fell on the Sunday before the feast of Christ the King, which is celebrated at the end of October. Priests The First parish priest was Fr. Pedro Paulo S. Santos (1914‚Äì1917). He was later to become the Archbishop of Nueva Caceres in Bicol. The first church edifice was constructed through his efforts, with the facade personally designed by him. Fr. Casto Ocampo (1917‚Äì1919) was from the town of Sta. Rita in Pampanga. He promoted the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus through the Cofradia del Sagrado Corazon de Jesus, and to him is attributed the annual celebration of Fiestang Corazon. He was followed by Rev. Fr. Felipe Romero (1919‚Äì1924) and Fr. Jacinto Vergara (1924‚Äì1930). The latter is still remembered for the ritual of \\"Tenieblas\\"* during the evening of Holy Wednesday before the Holy Mass. Between 1930 and 1932, Fr. Artemio Pascual took charge of the parish. His brief tenure (due to ill health) is still remembered for bringing back many Aglipayans in Brgy. San Rafael to the Catholic faith. Fr. Pascual was succeeded by Fr. Getulio Inggal (1932‚Äì1937), whose term was marked by his struggle with the Socialist Party in church affairs. Fr. Lazaro Pineda (1937‚Äì1942) renovated the parish rectory. He was followed by Fr. Melencio Garcia (1942‚Äì1949), Fr. Pedro Capati (1949‚Äì1950) and Fr. Restituto Canda (1950‚Äì1951). The parish priest who served longest was Msgr. Odon T. Santos (1951‚Äì1967). He is best remembered for his dream of transforming Calulut into a \\"city\\". He renovated the chalet-style rectory into a two-storey building. He also built a permanent stage on the church patio and installed the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in front of the church. It was during his time that many mandated organizations were organized. Msgr. Aquilino D. Ordonez (1967‚Äì1976) made his mark on the parish for two things: his passion for spiritual renewal and his concern for the economic development of the parishioners. The first was done through the Cursillo which became popular as a Christian renewal movement. He allowed the use of the rectory as a Cursillo House where hundreds of parishioners went through a \\"reconversion\\". The second was achieved through vocational classes such as dressmaking and electronics, farm demonstrations, animal husbandry, home gardening, piggery and poultry- raising. He also introduced the Samahang Nayon and the Green Revolution program to the farmers. All these were achieved with the assistance of various government agencies. One parish priest whose memory is still very alive in the parish was Msgr. Gregorio L. Canlas (1976‚Äì1984). Fresh from his travels abroad, Msgr. Canlas introduced innovations and promoted active lay participation in liturgical celebrations. His stay in the parish was marked in what is now known as \\"The Golden Age of Kapampangan Liturgical Music\\". His musical talents produced many liturgical songs that are still very popular today. Msgr. Canlas encouraged Scripture reading and reflection by organizing bible study and bible sharing groups. With the help of the Daughters of Charity, he promoted the Visita Domicilliaria, in which neighborhood families were organized into groups of thirty. The main feature of the \\"Visita\\" was the one-day visit of the image of the Miraculous Medal of the Virgin Mary to each member-family. In addition, each of the four \\"puroks of Calulut\\" were organized into a \\"Coro\\", identified by a Marian title. Thus, Patad/Mabalas became known as \\"Fatima\\", Centro was \\"Lourdes\\", the New Barrio was called \\"Del Carmen\\", and Pau was known as \\"Virgen de los Remedios\\". Once a month, Msgr. Canlas would visit each \\"Coro\\" to celebrate the Holy Eucharist. In hindsight, it can be said that the experience was the parish's precursor to building small ecclesiastical communities. Msgr. Canlas also emphasized catechetical instruction for the young, by professionally training and organizing volunteer catechists. He made catechism classes a requirement in all elementary schools and in the High schools of Sindalan and Calulut, catechism classes every Friday evening. Before he ended his term, Msgr. Canlas facilitated the purchase of an additional cemetery lot for the parish. Msgr. Abelardo S. Basilio succeeded Msgr. Canlas from 1984 to 1991. It was during his incumbency that the construction of a new rectory and the renovation of the church building were initiated. Both projects became successful because of the support and cooperation of the \\"Coros\\" and concerned parishioners. The construction was about to finish when he was assigned to a new parish. With the sustained cooperation of the people, Fr. Resurreccion G. Diwa (1991‚Äì1999) finished the construction. The facade of the present church was designed and constructed during his term. Fr. Adrian P. Paule, started his term in 1999 by reorganizing the Parish Pastoral Council and renovating the rectory. But the biggest impact of Fr. Paule's ministry so far is his pastoral vision that is open to lay participation. Since he began his term, parishioners have been experiencing creative and meaningful pastoral activities leading towards the celebration of the parish's 90th Foundation Anniversary. Highlights of this renewed pastoral outlook is the construction of the new parish church and the drawing up of an integrated parish pastoral renewal plan, where lay participation has been emphasized. The presence of two religious congregations, the St. Paul's Novitiate (priests and brothers) and the Congregation of the Dominican Sisters of Ilanz has also helped in the pastoral development of the parish. With the phaseout of the Ilanz sisters in Calulut, the local congregation of the Dominican Sisters of Our Lady of Remedies took over the apostolic endeavor started by the former. Fr.

Madam by the news media, operated Pamela Martin and Associates, an escort agency in Washington, D.C. Although she maintained that the company's services were legal, she was convicted on April 15, 2008 of racketeering, using the mail for illegal purposes, and money laundering. Slightly over two weeks later, facing a prison sentence of five or six years, she was found hanged. Autopsy results and the final police investigative report concluded that her death was a suicide.  Early life  Palfrey was born in the Pittsburgh area town of Charleroi, Pennsylvania, but spent her teens in Orlando, Florida. Her father was a grocer. She graduated from Rollins College with a degree in criminal justice, and completed a nine-month legal course at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law. Working as a paralegal in San Diego, California, she became involved in the escort business. Dismayed at how most services were run, including widespread drug abuse, she started her own company, recruiting mostly women over 25. In 1990, she was arrested on charges of pimping, pandering and extortion; after fleeing to Montana she was captured while trying to cross the Canada‚ÄìUS border and brought back for trial. Following her conviction in 1992 she spent 18 months in prison. After her release, she founded Pamela Martin and Associates.  D.C. Madam scandal  In October 2006, United States Postal Inspection Service agents posed as a couple who were interested in buying Palfrey's home as a means of accessing her property without a warrant. Agents froze bank accounts worth over US$500,000, seizing papers relating to money laundering and prostitution charges. In early 2007, Palfrey reacted to the suicide by hanging of Brandi Britton, one of her former escort service employees, by saying, \\"I guess I'm made of something that Brandi Britton wasn't made of.\\" Palfrey's escorts charged as much as $300 per hour, and many have had professional careers. Palfrey continued to reside in California, and cleared some US $2 million over 13 years in operation. Palfrey appeared on ABC's 20/20 as part of an investigative report on May 4, 2007. In response to Palfrey's statement that she had 10,000 to 15,000 phone numbers of clients, several clients' lawyers contacted Palfrey to see whether accommodations could be made to keep their identities private. Ultimately, ABC News, after going through what was described as \\"46 lb\\" [21 kg] of phone records, decided that none of the potential clients was sufficiently \\"newsworthy\\" to bother mentioning. Senator David Vitter (R-LA) acknowledged on the night of July 9, 2007, that he had been a customer of her escort service. Thirteen former escorts and three former clients testified at her trial. However, ABC News only published two of the names they had identified, men who were already known to have been clients of Palfrey ‚Äî Randall L. Tobias, a State Department official, and Harlan K. Ullman, a Defense Department official. Journalist Neil A. Lewis reported, in The New York Times, that ABC would not publicize any new names. The witnesses were compelled to testify, after being granted immunity from prosecution. In May 2007 a team at ABC News reported on their efforts to determine the identities of Palfrey's clients from her phone records. They reported how many of Palfrey's clients phoned from hotel rooms to obfuscate their identities. They found some clients had exaggerated their importance-one who had bragged about his role in evacuating colleagues from the White House on 9/11 turned out to merely work near The White House. On April 15, 2008, a jury found Palfrey guilty of money laundering, using the mail for illegal purposes, and racketeering. Palfrey believed that contrary to the U.S. Attorney's Office lower estimate, she might spend six or seven years behind bars. She faced a maximum of 55 years in prison.  Death  On May 1, 2008, Palfrey was found hanging in a storage shed outside her mother's mobile home in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Police found handwritten suicide notes in the bedroom where she was staying, dated a week before her death. The autopsy and the final police investigation concluded her death was a suicide. Palfrey's death resulted in her conviction being vacated.  Suicide notes  Palfrey's two handwritten notes were released to the public. In one of them, she wrote to her sister, \\"You must comprehend there was no way out, I.E. 'exit strategy,' for me other than the one I have chosen here.\\" In another, she described her predicament as a \\"modern-day lynching\\". She said she feared that, at the end of serving her sentence, she would be \\"in my late 50s a broken, penniless and very much alone woman\\".  Speculation surrounding her death  The New York Times Patrick J. Lyons wrote on the Times' blog, The Lede, that some on the Internet were skeptical that her death was a suicide. After investigating the crime scene, however, police found \\"no new evidence [that] would indicate anything other than suicide by hanging,\\" and a police investigative report released six months later concluded that her death had been a suicide. The police stated that Palfrey's family believed the notes were written by Palfrey. In early 2007, Palfrey learned of the death, apparently through suicide by hanging, of Brandi Britton, one of her former escort service employees. Palfrey reacted to this news by saying, \\"I guess I'm made of something that Brandy Britton wasn't made of.\\" According to her former attorney, Montgomery Blair Sibley, she even took the extraordinary step of writing directly to the prosecutor, promising to show more resolve than Britton. Journalist Dan Moldea, who was working with Palfrey on a book, recalled that in a 2007 conversation, Palfrey told him, \\"I am not going back to prison. I will commit suicide first.\\" He said her previous prison experience had traumatized her and she felt she couldn't do it again.  Palfrey's customer list  On July 9, 2007, Palfrey released the supposed entirety of her phone records for public viewing and downloading on the Internet in TIFF format, though days prior to this, her civil attorney Montgomery Blair Sibley had dispatched 54 CD-ROM copies to researchers, activists, and journalists.  2016 Presidential Election  Sibley, Palfrey's former attorney, claims to have her phone records and that they are relevant to the 2016 presidential election. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the request to lift a lower court order, in place since 2007, that bars Sibley from releasing any information about her records.

He was a member of the renowned musical establishments of the Habsburg court, including the chapels of Philip I of Castile and Charles V. While with Philip's chapel he was a close associate of composers such as Pierre de La Rue, Marbrianus de Orto, and Alexander Agricola.Meconi, p. 29-37, p. 73 Life Champion was born in or near Li√®ge, where he probably received his early training. Little information survives regarding his early life, and the first record relating to his involvement with Philip's Grande chapelle, the Habsburg chapel choir, dates from 13 November 1501, prior to Philip's first trip to Spain. He was one of the few singers who remained with the chapel after Philip's death in 1506, maintained by his wife Joanna the Mad; for several years after Philip's death, Joanna traveled around Castile with his corpse in its coffin, having her chapel choir sing requiems to it each night, until her father Ferdinand I finally had her locked up in the fortress at Tordesillas.Meconi, p. 40 After the dissolution of Joanna's chapel, Champion joined the chapel of Charles V. While there, he had a high status and was highly paid, according to court records, though he was always at a lower level than Pierre de La Rue. There is evidence that Champion may also have been associated with the court of Frederick the Wise, Duke of Saxony, such as the five-voice mass he wrote for them.Josephson, Grove online Music While only six of his works survive with reliable attribution, the recent reevaluation of a four-voice setting of the De profundis (Psalm 130) (long attributed to Josquin des Prez) gives evidence of his quality as a composer.Meconi, p. 73 Champion's surviving music includes two masses, both for five voices: Missa Maria Magdalena and Missa Ducis saxsonie: Sing ich niet wol; two psalm motets, one for four and one for six voices; and a secular song, Noch weet ick, in Dutch. The setting of De profundis, long attributed to Josquin, is relatively well-known: for example, Grout and Palisca's History of Western Music, often used in college music history courses, gives it as an example of Josquin's late style. The famous copyist Pierre Alamire attributed it to Champion in its earliest extant source, the manuscript VienNB Mus 15941, and the case has recently been made that the attribution should remain with Champion, for stylistic reasons.Patrick Macey, abstract to paper presented at the 1999 Josquin International Conference Stylistically his music is similar to Josquin's in many respects, including its large-scale tonal organization, use of motifs and paraphrase, and motivic development. In addition he used florid, rhythmically active textures with many layers. Notes References * *Honey Meconi, Pierre de la Rue and Musical Life at the Habsburg-Burgundian Court.

He is a state senator in the Montana Senate and also serves as the president of that body. He previously served in the Montana House of Representatives, including a term as minority leader and as speaker of the House. Sales is the only person, to be elected by his peers, to serve as the presiding officer of both bodies of the Montana Legislature. Sales is from Douglas, Wyoming.

He then worked for Hewlett-Packard and then a technology start-up, Extended Systems. Sales moved to Bozeman, Montana, in 1992, when Extended Systems established an office in the city. When the company was in the process of being acquired in 2001, by a larger public company, Sales sold his stock in the company and remained in Bozeman.

State House of Representatives Sales spent three terms in the Montana House of Representatives; his district, State House District 68, covered the northern part of Gallatin County and most of Broadwater County.Michael Tucker Scott Sales seeking legislative seat, Belgrade News (January 10, 2012). In his first term, Sales introduced 10 pieces of legislation, only one of which became law. Among the measures introduced by Sales as a freshman legislator was H.B. 281, a bill to eliminate the office of the commissioner of higher education; the bill died.A final look at work of 2003 Legislature, Independent Record (April 30, 2003). Sales was elected speaker of the Montana House of Representatives in 2007. At the time Sales became House speaker, he was relatively inexperienced; he assumed leadership of the chamber in just his second term and had never served as a committee chair. As speaker, Sales clashed with Governor Brian Schweitzer, opposing his budget proposal. Sales presided over a House controlled by Republicans by the thinnest of margins: during his term, there were 50 Republican representatives, one Constitution Party representative (Rick Jore) who was mostly allied with Republicans, and 49 Democratic representatives. The highly contentious legislative session ended in disarray, as the Legislature failed to pass a state budget, as required by the state constitution. In the ensuing special session, the budget was approved after Governor Schweitzer negotiated a compromise with several moderate House Republicans,Jennifer McKee, Rift seen in Belgrade newspaper's letters to the editor, Missoulian (June 4, 2010). effectively circumventing Sales. Sales was House minority leader in 2009, during a session when the House was evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. During his opening speech in 2009, Sales read out eight quotations and attributed them to Abraham Lincoln, although Lincoln in fact never said them. Once the spurious origin of the quotations were brought to light, Sales said that he had \\"got them off the Internet\\" and had no intention to mislead. Sales raised a point of personal privilege in the House to apologize.Charles S. Johnson, Sales' Lincoln quotes never said by Lincoln, Missoulian (January 9, 2009), also republished through the Lee News Service at The Pantagraph. Unsuccessful campaign for Gallatin County Commission He was ineligible to run for a fourth House term in 2010 due to term limits. He unsuccessfully ran for Gallatin County Commission in 2010, being defeated by incumbent commissioner Joe Skinner in the Republican primary election. Sales' primary candidacy sparked an acrimonious and public rift among state Republicans: some House Republicans (such as Jesse O'Hara and Walt McNutt) strongly criticized Sales' leadership as speaker and minority leader, while other House Republicans (such as Tom McGillvray) defended Sales. Americans for Prosperity In 2011 Sales was formerly the Montana state director for Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers-founded advocacy group.Sales says he'll run for state Senate, despite wife's embezzlement plea, Associated Press (February 9, 2012).Larry Mayer, Scott Sales, regional director for Americans for Prosperity, Billings Gazette (October 20, 2011).

State Senate In 2015, Sales successfully introduced legislation, which he co-drafted the year before, to raise the speed limit on highways such as Interstate 90 to 80 mph.Jerry Huerta, Montana Lawmakers Work to Raise Speed Limit, KFYR-TV (December 8, 2014).Richard Read, Montana Mulls 85 MPH Speed Limit, High Gear Media (December 4, 2014).Alison Noon, Montana Senate hears 80 mph speed limit proposal, Associated Press (March 5, 2015). Also in 2015, Sales voted against privacy legislation introduced by Senator Daniel Zolnikov to restrict the state government's digital collection and use of individuals' data. The bills specifically would have prohibited the state or local governments from using automatic license-plate readers and would have required authorities to obtain a search warrants in order to obtain electronic communications held on electronic devices or by Internet service providers. Sales stated that the bill would \\"encumber law enforcement from some activities that I don't think are abusive at this time\\" and were \\"solutions to problems that don't exist in Montana at this point.\\"Mike Dennison, Digital privacy bills dead: 'Solutions to problems that don‚Äôt exist in Montana at this point', Billings Gazette (March 29, 2015). State Senate president In November 2016, Sales won an internal election among state Senate Republicans to be the president of the Montana Senate in the 2017 election. His opponent was Senator Eric Moore of Miles City. Although the vote was by secret ballot, it was described as a close case. He assumed office in January 2017. Sales broke with tradition in January 2017 by deciding to not sit with the state House in the customary beginning-of-session joint sitting to hear speeches from members of Montana's congressional delegation, the chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court, the Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction, and a Native American leader.Charles S. Johnson, Montana Senate won't join House in hearing elected officials speak, Bozeman Daily Chronicle (January 11, 2017).

Johnson, Tester unveils Employ Montana plan, Bozeman Daily Chronicle (January 16, 2017).

As Senate president, Sales took the leading role in supporting legislation to give state lawmakers the right to carry concealed firearms in the state Capitol and on other state property and allowing restaurant customers to carry concealed firearms to restaurants. Both bills were passed by the Senate on mostly party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.Bobby Caina Calvan, Montana Senate endorses concealed weapons bills, Associated Press (March 28, 2017). As Senate president, Sales opposed legislation to fund infrastructure projects in Montana, saying that he generally opposed bond issues and preferred to spend cash on state building projects.Corin Cates-Carney, Fight Over Infrastructure Takes Shape at the Montana Legislature, Montana Public Radio (January 3, 2017). In March 2017, Sales said that he generally support privatizing the Montana State Fund (a semi-public entity that is the state's largest provider of workers' compensation insurance), but also said that he would consider supporting legislation to eliminate the fund entirely.Hayme Fraser, Two Senate Republicans seek to eliminate or privatize Montana State Fund, Ravalli Republic (March 22, 2017). In 2017, Sales opposed legislation to require motorists to maintain a distance of 3 feet from bicyclists at 35 mph or less, and 5 feet at faster speeds. In debate, Sales harshly attacked cyclists, calling them \\"some of the most self-centered, rude people navigating on the highways and county roads I‚Äôve seen\\" and saying that there were \\"too many of them\\" in Montana.Hollu K.

In 1978, McQuirter returned to Toronto and joined the Nationalist Party of Canada's executive council but, in 1979, he allowed his membership in the party to lapse due to disdain for leader Don Andrews and resumed his activity with the Klan full-time. At its peak, the Canadian chapter of the Klan was estimated by researcher Stanley Barrett to have approximately 2,500 members coming from every province of Canada. In 1981, McQuriter was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for his role in Operation Red Dog, the plot to overthrow the government of Dominica and install a white supremacist haven initiated with an American mercenary and Klan sympathizer who came into contact with Droege in 1979. The Dominican government learned of the plot in 1981 and arrested Patrick John the Dominican who was to be the coup d'√©tat's figurehead. The FBI arrested Droege in New Orleans.

With the KKK falling into disarray, McQuirter quit in the summer of 1982 with the intention of founding a more moderate organization.

In his petition, Bersosa said that the towns had grown so much in size that the former had 1,300 taxpayers while the latter had 1,600 taxpayers. As a result of this, the said priests could barely attend to the spiritual needs of such a great number of parishioners. This was also due to the great distance between the churches of Bacolor and Mexico which was three leagues away from each other through a street lined by a continuous row of houses leading from one church to the other. The Capsule-marker was laid on January 3, 2000 at the entrance of the Municipio. San Fernando became the 99th City of the Republic of the Philippines on February 4, 2001 by virtue of Republic Act 8990. The City of San Fernando prides itself as the home of numerous personages in Philippine history, among whom include socialist leader and assemblyman Pedro Abad Santos, war hero and former chief justice Jose Abad Santos, revolutionary heroine Nicolasa P. Dayrit, poet and legislator Zoilo S. Hilario, senator and father of the concrete pavement Sotero J. Baluyut, revolutionary governor Tiburcio T. Hilario, and celebrated prewar journalist Amando G. Dayrit. The Municipio was restored in 2003 by Mayor Rey B. Aquino.http://cityofsanfernando.gov.ph/new/history.php  Image gallery  File:Acityhallsanfernandojf.JPGMunicipio de San Fernando File:Cityhallsanfernandojf.JPGFa√ßade of Municipio de San Fernando File:Municipiosanfernandojf.JPGView of the second floor from the stairs File:Municipiosanfernandojfb.JPGSecond floor File:Municipiosfernando2jf.JPGMayor's Office File:Municipiosfernando2jfa.JPGMr. Toym de Leon Imao 2004 painting (stairway)http://www.propinoy.net/2011/05/23/ninth-search-for-ten- accomplished-youth-organization-begins/ File:Municipiosfernando2jfff.JPGThe other Imao painting (stairs) File:Municipiosfernando2jfdd.JPGMain door (half) File:Municipiosfernando2jfcc.JPGThe other half File:Municipiosanfernandojfc.JPGGround floor File:Sfernandomarkerjf.JPG1917 Marker File:Municipiosfernando2jfb.JPGCapsule-marker (January 3, 2000)  References Category:Buildings and structures in San Fernando, Pampanga San Fernando City Hall Category:Landmarks in the Philippines ","title":"Municipio de San Fernando"},{"id":"10968012","text":"First-seeded Jean Borotra defeated Christian Boussus 2‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì4 in the final to win the Men's Singles tennis title at the 1931 French Championships.

The original building was constructed shortly after the provincial capital of Pampanga was transferred from Bacolor to San Fernando in 1904. Annexes were added before the war. It was the site of a major battle between the Philippine Commonwealth troops and local guerrilla forces and the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.http://www.andropampanga.com/history_sanfernando.htm The Pampanga Provincial Capitol is one of the most beautiful civil architectural landmarks in the province.http://lakbaypinas.ph/landmarks.aspx?city=5416&grp;=Location&index;=2 History Interior The original provincial Capitol grounds of Pampanga in San Fernando covered an area of about 12 hectares. The Capitol was erected in 1907-1908, during the administration of Governor Macario Arnedo and no expenses were spared from making the seat of the local government, truly an attractive tourist attraction in itself. The expansive grounds are lush with landscaping, planted with mango and acacia trees, shrubs and flowering plants. The wooded area was named Silva Park, after the late provincial treasurer of Pampanga, Isabelo de Silva, who led in the drive to beautify the Capitol surroundings. When the age of electricity reached the province, the major lanes and walkways were lined and lit with Doric-style electric lamps; a radio system was installed to entertain the visiting public. One of the earliest structures stands in front of the Capitol Building‚Äîa stately statue of Gen. Maximino Hizon of Mexico, the highest ranking Kapampangan officer in the revolutionary army. He distinguished himself in many battles against the Spanish and American forces during the Philippine Revolution. Captured by Americans in June 1900, he was exiled to Guam together with other war leaders on 7 January 1901 and died there on 1 Sept. 1901.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons The patriot is depicted in full uniform, astride a handsome steed. The statue was installed in 1919, a donation of the Kapampangan people and the provincial government. As this picture shows, the monument was favorite ‚Äòphoto opportunity‚Äô spot for many local visitors. In 1929, an additional attraction‚Äîthe Provincial Zoological Garden‚Äîwas established, featuring a rare collection of caged exotic birds and rare animals for the public to enjoy. Tourists would even stop by Pampanga to view the mini-zoo en route to Baguio. The garden complemented the several tennis courts, the bandstand or glorietta, the clubhouse and the park benches. Events When San Fernando played host to the biggest spectacle of the province in 1933, the Capitol Grounds became the venue for the Pampanga Carnival Fair and Exposition. The Carnival was meant to promote Pampanga as the richest market outside of Manila, with rich limitless agricultural, commercial and industrial possibilities. Pavilions of the 21 towns of Pampanga were put up, featuring the best and finest products of each community. The fair was capped with the election of Miss Pampanga. Visitors from all over the country left the province very much impressed after having seen the events as well as the impressive venue. After the Carnival, a Rizal Memorial Forum was erected at the site of the provincial fair, at a cost of Php 18,000. Most of these points of interest are long gone from the Provincial Capitol grounds‚Äîsome destroyed by the War, others by overzealous reconstruction and expansion projects. Only the Hizon Monument at the Arnedo Park remains, now nearly a century-old, a mute witness to the scenic wonder of the place, that once marked the hallowed grounds of Pampanga‚Äôs Provincial Capitol.http://www.byahilo.com/2010/02/09/pampanga-provincial- capitol/#axzz2BzOVGPQ4  References External link * Category:Provincial capitols in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in San Fernando, Pampanga Category:Cultural Properties of the Philippines Category:Tourist attractions in Pampanga ","title":"Pampanga Provincial Capitol"},{"id":"10968022","text":"Second-seeded Jack Crawford defeated first-seeded, and reigning champion, Henri Cochet 8‚Äì6, 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì3 in the final to win the Men's Singles tennis title at the 1933 French Championships.

It was formerly known as Jose Abad Santos High School or JASHS. The current main building of Pampanga High School was completed in 1935. It follows Standard Plan No. 20 of Gabaldon schoolhouses and is currently being restored as part of the Heritage Schoolhouse Restoration Program of the Department of Education. Among its graduates is former President Diosdado P. Macapagal.30 HS students hurt in collapse of classroom floor.(Metro & National News) - Manila Bulletin - Questia Online Library Old building The Old Pampanga High School Building was the original site of the Pampanga High School. Completed shortly after 1910 it served as the main building of the Pampanga High School until 1935 when it was transferred to its present site. The building was then used as an annex of the school. It also served as the site of the University of the Philippines Extension Program in San Fernando, Pampanga until floods hit San Fernando in 1995. The beginnings of the Pampanga High School could be traced to the Eusebio Residence located near the town plaza of San Fernando where classes first began in 1908. Due to the lack of students, it was unable to form a senior class until 1911‚Äì1912. Its first principal was Mr. John W. Osborn. The school was later moved to this building near the Provincial Capitol in order to accommodate more students. The school population grew to 4000 plus students in the mid 1960s as youths from nearby towns started to enroll. Pablo Pinlac, the principal, started sports program like Track and Field, Basketball, Volleyball, Soccer, Baseball, etc. Thanks to coaches like Rafael Aguilar the school competed against other Central Luzon schools. Starting around this time, the school newspaper, The Pampangan was getting recognition nationally. Under Miss Gervacia Guarin's leadership, the school won several medals against schools from the big cities. In 1960, Pampanga High School had one of its more successful year when several writers won a gold medal (P. Lacson in Sportswriting), and two bronze medals and some top six winners. A lot of the graduates migrated to the US and became very successful doctors, nurses, accountants, etc. And those who stayed are just as prominent. In 2010, the Pampanga High School Student government installs ID Scanners to monitor the attendance of all the Students and faculties of Pampanga High School. It is one of the Public Schools who use this kind of system. The early foundations of what we know today as Pampanga High School were initially laid out in July 1901 when first American civil governor Howard H. Taft succeeded Major General Arthur MacArthur as American Chief Executive in the Philippines . Governor Taft, who became the 27th president of the United States of America in 1909‚Äì1913, fully established a civilian government in the Philippines to replace the military rule of his predecessors. One of the four executive departments of the central government, the Department of Public Instruction under the administration of Honorable Bernard Moses, a member of the Second Philippine Commission initiated public education in Pampanga and in other provinces of the Philippines . Twenty-five civilian educators from the six hundred American teachers known as Thomasites who arrived from the United States aboard the U.S.A.T. Thomas on August 23, 1901 were assigned in nineteen towns of Pampanga. The initial objectives of the American educators with the cooperation of municipal and provincial officials were to establish at least one primary school (Grades I to IV) in each municipality and the recruitment of native Pampangan teachers for training in the English language and in new teaching methods. A \\"teachers institute\\" was created in San Fernando to meet the need for native Pampangan teachers. It was quite a struggle in putting up a new educational system right after the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. New buildings had to be constructed; supplies, books and other instructional materials had to be procured. Pampangan native teachers had to learn the English language and had to be trained in new methods of teaching. The cooperation of parents and local government officials had to be solicited also. By 1905, about a year after the provincial capital was transferred from Bacolor to San Fernando, Governor Macario Arnedo was able to secure additional funds from the national government to open five intermediate schools (Grade V to VII) along with the provincial school and two trade schools, one in Apalit and one in Bacolor. By the end of the first decade of the 20th century, the intermediate schools increased to eight and the provincial normal school was converted into a regular high school. The trade school in Apalit ceased operations in later years while the trade school in Bacolor grew into an industrial arts and technical college, which was renamed later as Don Honorio Ventura College of Arts and Trades in honor of Governor and Secretary of the Interior HonorioVentura. The effort and sacrifices of the pioneering educators in Pampanga resulted to positive progress. As evidence of the quality of public education in Pampanga particularly in the secondary level, eleven (11) of the more than two hundred (200) participants to the \\"Pensionado Program\\" set up by the Philippine Commission in 1903 to 1910 were originally from Pampanga. Many of these government scholars with at least secondary education diplomas who were sponsored to study in American colleges and universities became great leaders in government service, law, education, medicine and politics. The most famous of these government scholars was Secretary of Justice and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Jose Abad Santos who is acclaimed today as a national hero. In the 1918-1919 commencement exercises of the University of the Philippines, Pampangans were awarded the second highest total of degrees. Only graduates from the Manila area exceeded the total of Pampangan UP graduates in that particular school year. Such commendable accomplishments validated the intellectual excellence of many Pampangan students and the outstanding college preparation they received from their secondary school teachers. The Golden Jubilee Celebration Souvenir Program of Pampanga High School in 1962 indicated that in 1908 the Pampanga High School classrooms were located in a big house in downtown San Fernando known then as the \\" Buison Building \\". When the student population increased tremendously, the Pampanga High School moved to a bigger concrete building along the old highway near the Provincial Capitol in barrio Santo Nino. The high school building in downtown San Fernando became later a popular lodging and dining facility known as Pampanga Hotel and Restaurant. The school principal during the early years of Pampanga High School was an American educator by the name of John W. Osborn. Nineteen (19) students graduated in 1912 with Wenceslao Vitug as valedictorian and Macaria Roque as salutatorian. The school was under the supervision of American educators until 1935 when the last American principal, Charles G. Whitewell was succeeded by Demetrio Andres who served as school principal until 1939. In 1937, during the administration of provincial Governor Pablo Angeles David when the Philippines was still a commonwealth and Manuel L. Quezon was the president, classes were transferred again to new and bigger facilities along Teopaco Street now known as High School Boulevard in San Fernando, Pampanga. The concrete high school building near the provincial capitol was converted to a military hospital after World War II. It became later the San Fernando Branch of the University of the Philippines until it was significantly damaged by lahar in 1991. Classes at Pampanga High School were interrupted in 1942 to 1944 due to World War II. When regular classes were resumed after the war, Alvaro Punla and Wilfredo Castro graduated valedictorian and salutatorian, respectively, in 1945. In an exchange of emails with Dr. Antonio R. Suba of PHS Class 1942, he wrote that the members of his class received their diplomas in 1946 in a special graduation ceremony. Class members who perished during World War II were honored and their respective families received their diplomas. Repairs and renovations of aging facilities and structural damage brought by the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and other calamities are being initiated as funds become available through government appropriations and donations from generous alumni. The federation of school alumni associations under the presidency of Mr. Angelo D. David of Class 1947 is currently raising funds and coordinating the implementation of the Total Master Site Development Plan of the Pampanga High School to meet the needs of a growing student population. On October 22, 2005, the ground breaking ceremony of a new three storey building to be built at the school campus was attended by prominent alumni, school administrators, faculty members and government officials.http://www.andropampanga.com/history_phs.htm Noted alumni *President Diosdado P.

Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital is located in San Fernando, Pampanga, Philippines. It is a Level III tertiary, training and teaching hospital with 250 authorized beds as mandated by Republic Act (R.A.) 6780 enacted in 1990. The hospital caters to the people of Region III, with the people of Pampanga as its primary catchment area and the nearby provinces of Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Tarlac, Zambales and Aurora as its secondary catchment areas.‚ÄúJose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital‚Äù (home page). History In the nearly 100 years of existence of the Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital, enormous development had been done in terms of facility improvement, manpower complement and capability enhancement. Indeed, the hospital had come a long way. From its beginning in 1921 from the two (2) hectare lot at Dolores, San Fernando, Pampanga donated by the late Juan Teopaco, it is now regarded as one of the leading referral center in the region. The JBLMRH started at an eight (8) bed capacity hospital formerly known as Pampanga Provincial Hospital. It was financed and operated by provincial health funds under the management of six pioneering individuals headed by Dr. Lorenzo de Jesus. To satisfy the growing hospital need of the people, various material improvements were introduced in the hospital, thus increasing its bed capacity from eight (8) beds to fifty (50) beds in January 1951. Later in July 1964, the hospital‚Äôs name changed into Central Luzon General Hospital with the corresponding increase in its bed capacity to one hundred twenty five (125) beds. Dr. Bartolome Vecta was appointed as Chief of Hospital during this time. Further construction of various facilities in the hospital led to the increase in its bed capacity to one hundred fifty (150) in 1972 and again to two hundred beds (200) in 1975. In 1979, Dr. Vecta was replaced by Dr. Ignacio Valencia. During the incumbency of Dr. Valencia, a building that can accommodate one hundred beds was constructed, thus finally increasing the hospital‚Äôs bed capacity into two hundred fifty (250) beds. Dr. Conrado Mariano took the helm of managing the hospital after Dr. Ignacio Valencia. On March 1988, Dr. Mariano was promoted to Assistant Regional Director at the Regional Health Office No. 3, hence he was replaced by the then Provincial Health Officer of Bataan in the person of Dr. Rogelio Reyes. Dr. Reyes served the hospital for three years until finally in February 1991 he retired to give way to his political ambition. On November 25, 1989, RA No. 6780 entitled ‚ÄúAn Act of Changing the Name of the Central Luzon General Hospital located in the municipality of San Fernando, province of Pampanga, to Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital‚Äù was one of the bills signed by the then former President Corazon C. Aquino. It is on this day on that the hospital was recognized as Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital. Dra. Venus Galang, the then Chief of Medical Professional Staff was appointed as Officer-in-Charge in March 1991 to fill-in the position left by Dr. Reyes. During the term of Dra. Galang, the hospital was being awarded for being a Baby Friendly Hospital. On December 1992, Dr. Ladislao Yuchongco was appointed as permanent Chief of Hospital of Jose B.

Macintosh. History Claris CAD was developed in 1988 by Claris Corporation in a joint effort with Craig S. Young of Computer Aided Systems for Engineering (CASE). It was based on MacDraw II and Young's earlier CAD application, EZ-Draft.Young, Craig S. \\"A Few Thoughts on Claris CAD from its Developer: Craig Young of CASE.\\" Introduction. Technical Drawing with Claris CAD. By James K. Anders. ScottForesman, 1991. xi-xiii. Version 1 was released in 1989 for Macintosh computers running System Software 6 or later. The initial releases were plagued with bugs, especially with the bundled plotter driver. Development halted in June 1991 with the release of version 2.0.3.Apple Tech Notes Currently, Claris CAD can be run on older Macintoshes using the \\"Classic\\" emulator included by Apple in Mac OS X 10.4.11 or older, or on current machines using the SheepShaver open-source \\"Classic\\" emulator (tested through Mac OS X 10.7). Features Claris CAD uses a drawing system defined by Tools, Methods, and Modifiers. Tools draw objects, methods allow different ways of drawing with the tools, and modifiers help to position objects.Claris CAD Tutorial Workbook. Claris Corporation, 1988. 1-1. Some notable tool functions include: walls, arcs, chamfers, fillets, spline curves, perpendiculars, and tangents. Dimensioning tools can create point-to-point, chain, datum, angle, radius, diameter, and circle-center dimensions. Predefined ANSI Y14.5, ISO, DIN, JIS, and BS-308 drawing standards templates are also included with the software. A special Claris version of Microspot Ltd.'s MacPlot plotter driver was also part of the package, allowing Claris CAD to plot to Hewlett-Packard and Houston Instruments plotters. A utility called MacPlot Configure also lets the user specify a plotter model and assign pen colors to carousel positions. The physical software package provides a reference, tutorial, and a videotape tutorial.Claris CAD packaging. Claris Corporation, 1989. Limitations Though Claris CAD is sufficient for creating floor plans and manual orthographic projections, many users require three-dimensional capability. Most users have abandoned it because it can no longer run natively on modern machines. However, long-term users with numerous files in ClarisCAD format and limited 3D needs continue to use it by running the Sheepshaver \\"Classic\\" emulator on current Mac computers. Due to speed/memory increases of current hardware, performance under emulation is superior to native operation on older machines, and stability does not seem to have been compromised. Among its other anomalies, the limited accuracy QuickDraw routines were not sufficient for direct use with highly accurate applications such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines.Apple Tech Notes Some versions of the program (including 2.0 v3) have a bug where users are unable to save their work, encountering an error stating that an additional 1k of disk space is required. This is due to a limitation of saving to large size, HFS+ formatted disks. One can save to a floppy disk or small RAM disk as a workaround, or use the \\"Save As...\\" command, renaming the file in the process.
